W February, 1947 \DC 88050/1 1 SmiARY OJ^’ CONCLUSIGNS AND KSQOMMEimATIONS ON THE ROUTE BETIVEEN P/J1ESTINE INDI/i L Our survey confirmed that the only airfield on this section of the ■ route, with an existing runway capable of taking Tudors, was Dhahran. * ^Routing British aircraft through this airfield will, however, necessitate considerable forethought and preparation. It is not anticipated that there will be any particular difficulty over Telecoms, Met. and Flying Control, although it will probably be necessary to arrange for the existing staffs to be increased, either by British or American personnel, whichever can be arranged with the Saudi Arabian Government, Accommodation, however, presents a major problem at phahran, and it will undoubtedly be necessary for us to build accommodation for night stopping passengers, and also for the permanent B.O.^.C, staff on the station. Dhahran is still ninety nine per cent an American station, and likely to remain so for several years, despite the fact that it has been designated as an international airport by the Saudi Arabian Government. In this connection it is thought that it would be very advisable to ensure that British services routed through this station should be as self si^pporting as can possibly be arranged, as even if the Americans proved willing to help us in emergency, their resources are extremely limited. It is therefore recommended that if it is decided to route Tudor II’s through Dhahran, a B.O.A.C, mission should visit the station as soon as possible to prepare the . exact details and terms of their occupation. ( As is recommended in the main body of our report, an alternative to using Dhahran is to extend the main runway at Shaibah. This can be achieved very cheaply and rapidly, and if this solution is adopted, immediate negotiations should be opened with the Air Ministry, as prompt actioji is required. It is our view that the use of Shaibah offers several advantages over DhaJiranj they can be listed as follows:- (1) Shaibah is a British airfield in British influenced territory. (2) Dhahran is subject to frequent severe dust storms, which can reduce visibility to less than 500 yards. Shaibah, on the other hand, although subject to dust storms, does not suffer to anything like the same extent. (3) A t Shaibah, all the ground equipment etc., is to standard British pattern; Met,, Flying Control, and Telecoms, would only require the addition of civilian personnel. (l) There is ample existing passenger accommodatioy, either at Shaibah, or at the hotel)- on the airport at Basrah, (5) ( 6 ) There is a large potential trunk route air lift in Iraq, and since neither Baghdad,, or Basrah are likely to have airfields capable of handling Tudor 11*3 for several years to come, the use of Shaibah offers a solution to this problem. The interim use of Shaibah as a short terra policy, would give us breathing space to consider the implications and possibili ties of developing a new civil airport on Bahrein Island, which is the obvious long term solution to our problem on this section of the route. That is, if we do not wish to use Dhahran. It is therefore our recommendation, that the main runway at Shaibah be extended immediately to take care of Tudor II operations. /&gt;0 M. C. A. FAR EASTERN TECHNICAL SURVEY REPORT BAGHDAD 1. Bagdad West This airfield has two prepared runways No. 1 North-west by south-east 6,300 ft. x 130 ft. No. 2 North-east by south-west 2,1+30 ft. x 150 ft. A study of the available meteorological data showed that a useability of over 90/o could be obtained from the main runway alone, for all except very light aircraft. The subsidiary runway was, therefore, not given further consideration. The field lies in open country to the west'of the city, and all except one of the approaches are unobstructed. Unfortunately, a main road runs 240 ft. away from the south-east end of the main runway. This road is raised 10 ft. above aerodrome level and allowing for 10 ft. high vehicles on the road, it was calculated that using a 1 in 50 approach gradient, 750 ft. of the runway should be sterilised. In practice, it is not. Using a calculated density altitude of 3,800 ft. it was found that it would be necessary to extend this main runway by 500 ft. to bring it up to PICAO Class C lengths. Investigation shov/ed that it would, in fact, be possible to extend this ^ runway to the north-west by approximately 1,500 ft. So that both the extension needed to compensate for the 750 ft. sterilisation, and the 500 ft. PICAO 'C' extension could be achieved if necessary. After an inspection of the runway, and consultations with the R.A.F. engineers at Habaniya, it was unanimously agreed that the runway was incapable of carrying loads greater than 26,000 lbs. on two wheels. This limitation is only operative after rains, which may occur any time between October and April. For the rest of the year, when the ground is baked hard, it was estimated that the runway would carry loads of anything up to 80,000 lbs. 2• Ac com mod ati on Domestic and technical accommodation at the airfield is fairly modern. There is a well constructed permanent terminal building, with full facilities for passenger handling etc. This building incorporates a Control Tower, which is at present completely unequipped (see Appendix C). There is one hangar on the air field, abutting the aprons adjacent to the terminal building. It is of steel construction, with floor space 140 ft. x 84 ft. and will accommodate from 7 to 8 Rapides, but is unable to accommodate Dakotas owing to its doorway limitations. C• General Remarks Conversations with the Iraq Government and aviation authorities, confirmed that they have plans to build a PICAO Class B airfield on a site some 2 or 3 miles west of the existing airfield. The site was inspected, and from an operational aspect it was found to be ideal, lying as it does in flat open country, with unobstructed flying approaches. For load bearing capacity etc., see Engineering Report at Appendix A. The Iraqis produced a lay out plan for this site, which we were given to understand was produced for them by Colbeck during his term of office as Air Attache at Cairo (copy of plan attached.) Our only comments on this lay-out are that, (a) the calculated PICAO Class B lengths shown for the main runway should be 8,330 ft. and not 7,800 ft. as shown on the plan, (b) that for all except light aircraft, a one runway lay-out should *be adequate. As far as could be calculated from the available meteorological data, the orientation of the main runway, as shown on the plan, is correct. Enquiries made through the D.C.A. Iraq, Akram Mustak Bey, and also through Mr. Carter, the Second Secretary at the Embassy, as to when these proposals to build a Class B airfield would be implemented, brought forth no very definite DC 88050/1 3DC 88050/1 4 reply. Guesses vary from 2 to 4- years. Our own impression was that the latter ~ would be more correct. A general election is pending in Iraq, and it would seem that the development of the new airfield is very much dependant upon its result. In consequence, everyone concerned is extremely reluctant to commit themselves to any very definite statement on the subject. However, a concensus of responsible opinion seemed to be that it would be unsafe to count on new airfield facilities at Baghdad inside 3 years. The position, therefore, is as follows The present airfield is completely unsafe for anything heavier than a Dakota for six months of the year. It is capable of being reinforced, and extended to PICAO Class C standards, and it is estimated that the work would take approximately six months to complete, at a cost of £200,000. The Iraqis present attitude is that it would be a waste of money to develop the existing airfield when, according to them, they will have the new site developed v/ithin 18 months, or 2 years time. Their attitude is also coloured by the fact that a Sv/edish air line has been operating a D. C. A service into the airfield for the last six months, so far v/ithout mishap. It would seem, therefore, that unless the Iraq Government can be persuaded to extend and reinforce their existing airfield (which is thought to be extremely unlikely), it will not be possible for B. O.A.C. to serve Baghdad with 1+ engined aircraft until the new aerodrome, or at least one runway, on the new aerodrome, has been constructed. If this limitation is going to interfere seriously with their plans, the only other alternative is for them to use the R.A.F. aerodrome at ^ Habaniya, which is some 55 miles by road from Baghdad. Habaniya has one runway, 6,300 ft. long, which cannot be extended. It has an estimated bearing capacity of 60,000 lbs. and is capable of occasional use by aircraft of 80,000 lbs. The PICAO Class C main runway length corrected for density altitude in this area is 7,000 ft. hence Tudors would be unable to use Habaniya, though perhaps Yorks might. 4. C onc lusio ns a nd R ecom mendations It is for consideration that either by direct representation from the i/Iinistry, or through the Embassy, that the Iraq Government should be asked either to undertake some interim development of Baghdad West, or accelerate the develop ment of their new airfield. Bearing in mind the aerodrome standards agreed to by Iraq at the Cairo Regional PICAO Conference, it is thought that this report contains sufficient 'ammunition* of a technical nature to enable us to put a very strong case either to PICAO, or direct to the Iraq Government, asking that an airfield of the agreed standard be provided at an early date, since demonstrably the existing facilities ^ offered are far below those agreed at Cairo. At present Baghdad West barely conforms to PICAO Class G standards. Airfield Lighting. None - Goose neck flares available on request. It is reported that the R.A.F. are supplying a standard type portable electric flare path. Baghdad. 23.1.47.DC 88050/1 5 APPENDIX A Engineeri ng Apprec iation Baghdad Y/est 1. General The original runv/ays were built to lengths of 1,000 and 800 metres respectively, and consisted of A' unconsolidated depth of gravel bitumen mix, laid direct on the soil which on this site, is silt. In 19A4, the 1,000 metre runway was extended to a total length of 2,000 metres, and in this case, the construction was slightly heavier; an average of 6*' depth of soil was removed, the sub grade thus exposed rolled and oiled, and the excavated material, after mixing with road oil, was back filled and shaped to reasonable formation; on top of this formation A' unconsolidated depth of gravel macadam was laid, and the whole heavily bitumen sprayed. At the same time, the original 1,000 metre length was given a thin top carpet of gravel macadam, probably about 1' thick. So far as can be determined, no strengthening was carried out to the original 800 metre runway. Standings and taxi tracks are of mixed construction, some being in gravel macadam, and some in concrete; all except a small area of concrete, recently laid, are in a bad condition. 2. Drainage At no time has serious drainage work been carried out on this site. 3• Sub-spil The soil on this site is very fine silt; when dry, this becomes hard and tough, and will carry high wheel loads. When wet, however, it swells to some extent, and its bearing capacity falls off rapidly. If, therefore, the sub soil can be kept dry, there is no insuperable difficulty in the construc tion of excellent runways, taxi tracks, etc. A. Beari ng strength of e xisting construction The present condition, especially of the main runway, is far from satis- lactory; the original 1,000 metre length has cracked over most of its area, there is evidence of silt having been punped through some cracks by the action of a passing wheel following rain, and at spots the runway has completely dis- inoegrated. On the extension of the runway, evidence of distress is more limited, but it is clear that even this portion has been over loaded from time to time. In view of the very light form of construction, and the bad condition of the original length of runway, the safe all up weight of aircraft for this runway cannot be assumed at more than 26,000 lbs. after rain fall. When the ground is dry, however, it will carry weights greatly in excess of this, probably up to about 44&gt;000 lbs. It is known that D. C.A's use this airfield, but it is not felt that such isolated use can justify the classification of the runway for all weather use at limits beyond 26,000 lbs. 5. Improyeme nt s The estimated cost for bringing this one runway up to PICA0 Class C standards is £200,000. This would involve virtually the provision of a new runway, and complete drainage works, and it is estimated six months would be required to complete this work.DC 88050/1 6 APPENDIX A M.C.A. PAR EASTERN TECHNICAL SURVEY REPORT NEW CIVIL AIRPORT BAGHDAD Examination of the above site failed to disclose any major difficulty in the way of providing full airport facilities to Class B Standards. It is thought that the development of this site would take at least 3 years from date of commencement of work, but it should be possible to lay down one runway and access road in 18 months. 2. It is, however,.considered that the cost of providing full Class B facilities will be considerably in excess of the Iraq Government estimate of £1,300,000 but no attempt has been made to estimate the cost of the airport to any degree of accuracy. 3* The sub soil on this site is very similar to that at Baghdad West, so that careful drainage and water proofing works will be essential to the construction of economical runways, taxi tracks, standings etc. on this silty soil. Samples of the soil have been despatched to Air Ministry, London, for analysis. Test results will be communicated to the Director of Civil Aviation, Iraq Government.DC 88050/1 .7 L. C.a.

A ^ ormal request has been made by the Iraqi Government to the British Service ^Pf^t of a British expert as Director of the Iraqi Met. Service. This request has been forwarded to the Foreign Office, London. ' of fr ° m th6 D,C ’ A * that a rec0ilimendatio n for the appointment of Abdul Jabbar Abdullah as Director has been sent to the appropriate Iraqi approved^ ‘not! ^ ^ n ° firm information whe ther this appointment has beenn * 7 It was pointed out that there could not be two directors. The D. C. A. stated that he would still like to have the services of a British expert, if only in an advisory capacity, and did not wish to take steps to amend the request made through the British Ambassador. No further official information regarding the appointment of a director was available before depart'ore from Baghdad. All future develooment of an independent Iraqi Meteorological Service depends on the appointment of a director and. it is recommended that action should be taken to clarify the present position. If the Iraqi Government decide to appoint a British director, it is recommended that action be taken, as a matter of 'urgency, to nominate a suitable official. Arrangements are almost complete for two Iraqi forecasters at Baghdad to undergo, at Habbaniya, a refresher course in forecasting. A. Implementatio n of _PICA0 prqcedures Comments on the requirements for the implementation of PICAO procedures have been prepared by Mr. She'llard, but no firm plans have been prepared. 5. Recpmjrendations The primarv need for the development of an independent Iraqi Meteorological Service is the appointment of a director. It is recommended that action be takr t as outlined in the penultimate sub-paragraph of para. 3 above. \ At Bagrah. 25.U+7. /•v \ DC 88050/1 87 &amp; DC 88050/1 9 APPENDIX C BAGHDAD 7/EST The following information was obtained from a series of discussions between 19th January, 1947 and 23rd January, 1947, with the following officials:- 1« Ai r Tr affic Control 1.1. Gene ra l ihe existing control arrangements are not considered very satisfactory* The service provides aerodrome control only, and the hours of watch are from dawn to dusk, with night landings on request, given six hours notice. There are no R.A.F. personnel on the aerodrome, and control is at present exercised by 3 Iraqis who have attended a one month's course at Heliopolis (2 were failed.) The chief deficiency is in their lack of flying experience. Arrangements have, fortunately, been made to employ 2 British Controllers (one is on his way from U.K.), and an ex pilot (Captain) from the Iraqi Air Force, who lias passed the Heliopolis course. The D. C.A. considers that with these latter exercising control and simultaneously instructing the present staff, the situation should be covered. In this I concur, whilst the traffic density remains as at present 10-12 movements per day). Jith the arrival of the new recruits, it is intended to keep continuous watch on approach and aerodrome control. No plans have yet been formulated for area con trol for the flight safety region, and I feel that Basrah, is the obvious centre for the interim area control (vide Cairo PICAO Doc. C.A.143 A.T.C. C.A. 44 pars. 8.4.3 and 9.2). The language in use is normally English, and the Iraqi staff are sufficiently well versed in this respect. 1.2. Accomm oda tion and Equi pment The existing Control Tower is unsatisfactory in as much- as it has a 'blind' sector of 18C . The remaining 180° of field view allows an unobstructed survey of the landing area, but aircraft orbiting are out of sight for half the circuit. The approach to runway 31 (main runway - in use over 9Q/o of the time) is obscured in this manner. A new tower will be constructed in the near future above the present one. This will be well situated with a 3^0° field of viev/. Present control equipment in the tower consists of:- 1.3. Safety Pr ecaut ions A serious hazard exists in the presence, on the landing area, of donkeys, camels, natives etc. , who regard transit across the aerodrome as a right of way. At present, mounted patrols keep the runway clear to the best of their ability, but in spite of this, there have been numerous instances of aircraft having to overshoot through a last minute infringement of the runway. The mounted patrol are warned of the approach of aircraft by the chiming of a bell mounted on the Control Tower. A fence is in course of erection, and until this is complete, the greatest caution must be exercised in day landings, and night landings avoided completely. A crash waggon has been purchased from the R.A. F. and is manned during control hours of watch. No doctor or ambulance is available on the aerodrome. A case occurred recently where an aircraft signalled for a doctor to be avail able on landing. The doctor did not arrive until 30 minutes after the aircraft landed. Akram Mu stale Bey Jallal Hejid P.

The D.C.A. however, is aware of this, and when proposed improvements are implemented, a service should be available which will be satisfactory for present needs. The existing staff, given suitable guidance by the experienced personnel who are being engaged, should be capable of exercising efficient control, as the anticipated increase in traffic flow requires their service. 2. Ai r Sa fety Air search facilities are available in the shape of R.A.F. Squadrons based at Habbaniya, and three Iraqi Air Force aircraft based at Baghdad. Direct communication exists between Baghdad West and Habbaniya (telephone and point to . point). These aircraft can cover the normal route between Cairo/Lydda - H.3 - Baghdad - Basrah - Bahrein/Dahran, but would be of no value for air search on the direct route Cairo/Lydda - Bahrein/Dahran, on account of their range limitations. Desert police are available for desert rescue operations.mi APPENDIX D IRAQ - BAGHDAD 19th-23rd January, 194-7. TELECOIvlCUN I CAT I ON S and A2RADI0 ASPECTS 1. General 2 . 1.1. In addition to interviev;s with the personalia noted in the main report, technical discussions took place with Mr. P. J. Gilroy, Chief Radio Engineer, D.C.A. Department, Galal Hejid, Asstt: D.C.A. and Mr. S. Pralle, Radio Engineer, Iraqi Airways. 1.2. Consideration of the facilities available (see para. 2) and review of the organisation to be developed, bearing in mind the time factor irfrolved, left little doubt that for at least another two years the only long range route Aeradio Organisation capable of carrying out the P.I.C.A.0. Recommendations for Iraq would have to be centred on BASRAH. This is in accordance with the deliberations on this matter at the Cairo P.I.C.A. 0. Conference. 1*3* When the plans for BAGHDAD have been implemented, there appears no operational reason why the main Aeradio and Communication Centre for Operational Control should not be transferred from BASRA to BAGHDAD. This is especially so, if concurrently with the development of the new AERADIO organisation, the proposed new International Airport is constructed. This is considered a relatively long term project however. 1.4* Immediate reinforcement of the existing equipment at BAGHDAD is necessary to maintain efficiently the present facilities. Action has already been taken by the Chief Radio Engineer and the Iraqi Government for the purchase of A R.A.P. equipment from Middle East resources to cover the immediate future. Much delay has been experienced in obtaining deliveries and signal action with U.K.C.A.T.R. Cairo was taken to expedite delivery. Fa p ilit ies Ex tant 2.1. Air/Ground/Air H/F W/T 6590 Kcs.)

FUTURE PLANS The Chief Radio Engineer has planned a new Aeradio Organisation to function under the D.C.A. This includes new transmitting and receiving stations, ground for which has been surveyed and action initiated for acquisition. The plans cover the full Cairo P.I.C.A.O. recommendations for LR airports and include a 12 channel transmitting station with five Marconi S\VB8 transmitters. The main equipment is already on order through the Crown agents in U.K. 4.1. From observations made during the visit, it is certain that these plans will take some considerable time to develop and it is not expected that they will be available to International Air Services in their entirety under at least two years. 5.0. PERSONNEL The Iraqi Aeradio personnel are trained under the P &amp; T Deptt: at present. European supervision and direction is necessary at the present stage of development and is likely to continue for some time. 6.0. EQUIPMENT Bearing in mind the fact that the Iraqi Government is purchasing Aeradio equipment for its long-term plan in the U.K. through the Crown agents, it is recorded that the purchase of the ex R.A.P. equipment required for the immediate future be expedited. Local action has been taken via U.K.C.A.T.R. Cairo. 6 . 1 . Extreme difficulty exists in obtaining even minor ancilliary Radio equipment and no basic stores system is available. Where adequate R.A.F. Stores facilities are available, it is recommended that U.K.C.A.T.R. Cairo be advised and authorised to co-ordinate such simple requirements on purcliase basis by the authorities con cerned in order that the maintenance and operation of ex R.A.F. equipment now in use and on order for the interim Aeradio Services can be assured. 7.0. CONCLUSIONS 7.1. From the wider aspect of International Aeradio Services for Iraq, the only immediate organisation which appears likely to be developed will be based on Iraqi officials, European technical direction and supervision, Iraqi personnel. Provision and operation by an operating agency to International standards may well be the solution for such areas as Iraq, but from observation guidance on a high level will be necessary combined with local knowledge before such an approach could be made. 7.2. The centralisation of main Aeradio communications for Control, Met, SAR and Operational requirements must be at BASRAH, where comparatively comprehensive facilities already exist, pending development of plans for BAGHDAD. The localised facilities outlined in para. 3 will cover projected services for the interim period. Karachi. 3rd February, 1947.DC 88030/1 13 n 0 BaSRaPI 1. Bas rah. Margil . This airfield has 4 runways as follows: ESE - OT ME - SS\7 SSE - NMW ENE - \ m 6450 ft. long by 150 ft. wide. 3009 ft. long by 130 ft. wide. 2934 ft. long by 150 ft. wide. 2863 ft. long by 150 ft. wide. Using a density altitude of 3900 ft. it was calculated that a main runway length of 7050 ft. was required to meet PICAO Class C standards, and 8365 ft. for Class B standards. For existing conditions, bearing strengths, etc. see Appendix A. The airfield is circumscribed by the Euphrates and the Shatt-A1-Arab on one side, and by canals on the other sides - see Plan I attached. It is therefore virtually impossible to extend this airfield in any direction. The Basrah Port authorities have a proposal to construct a new airfield immediately adjacent to the existing field on a site to the south-west. These proposals, however, have not progressed beyond the drawing office, and it is thought that little can be expected in the way of a new airfield for several years to come. Conversations held with the Port authorities concerning the condition of the main runway brought to light the fact that they propose taking immediate steps to re-surface and generally recondition this runway. For full details see Appendix a. However, even when this work is completed, the airfield will s 'kiH be below Class C standards, and unsuitable for any aircraft heavier than say a York. The limitations on this airfield are of both length and strength. It cannot be extended, and although in the dry season, its strength is probably in excess, of 100,000 lbs. during the rainy season, even aftet* reconstruction, it is estimated that the bearing capacity v/ill not be greater than 60,000 lbs. 3. A ccommodatio n rv There is an excellent terminal building and combined hotel on this airfield, which can accommodate 100 night stopping passengers. The hotel is air conditioned, under British management, and is probably the best hotel in Iraq. The Control Tower, situated on top of this building, is well equipped and efficiently run. For full details, see Appendix C., It should be noted that this hotel is also used to accommodate passengers on the flying boat service, the alighting area being immediately behind the hotel on the Shatt-al-Arab. 4 . Airfield Light ing The field is excellently equipped with flood lights and an electric flare path, beacons and boundary lights etc. Details of the lay out will be found on the attached Plan II. 5c Conclus ion and Recom mendat ions Since this airfield was found to be below the required standards, and could not be developed, it was not given further condideration.* 2. GeneralqHBPHPHHHBMPVHMHI DC 88050/1 14 APPENDIX A BASRAH En gin e e ring Appre oiati on 1. General The existing airfield is surrounded by water or main railway sidings, so that extension of the runways is virtually impossible; only one runway, bearing 118° - 298°.has sufficient length for the operation of even medium weight aircraft. This report is accordingly confined to this runway, and the hard standings. 2. Subsoil The subsoil is a fine silt, similar to that obtaining throughout_the Tigris-Euphrates valley, but apparently less stable, due to higher moisture content than that at Baghdad; the salt content appeared to be fairly high. Subsoil water level is about 3 ft. below ground level. 3. Drainage A little airfield drainage has been undertaken to date (see Plan 2) but drainage is not provided to runway margins. A scheme is now in hand to provide powerful pumps at two points on the airfield to either pump out of, or into the drainage canals on the west, south and east sides of the airfield depending on the level of water in the Euphrates and Shatt A1 Arab. By judicious use of these pumps it is hoped to maintain a reasonably constant water table level under the airfield, and therefore practically constant subsoil conditions. 4. Main Runway and Standings (See Plan 2 for diagram representation of areas of different construction.) The main runway is, from an engineering standpoint, in two parts, the southern 1000 metres, built in 1936, being of lighter construction than the northern 1000 metres built in 19 ^ 4 - The southern portion has, in general, a construction of 4 consolidated sand bitumen mix direct on the silt (in some spots on clay filling) with a i» running surface of gravel bitumen mix. This construction has failed under present traffic, and is now receiving constant and heavy maintenance; it will be reconstructed during the summer of 19^7 to a strength equal to that of the remaining portion of the runway. The northern portion has 14' stone pitching under a carpet of either 3 M sand bitumen mix, or 2” gravel bitumen mix - about 300 metres of each, the gravel being at the nothern end, topped with a 1' gravel running carpet. The stone is rather soft limestone, and may be expected to 'weather' rather badly in the damp conditions on this airfield, while the top carpet has been applied with an inadequate tack coat; as a result it has disintegrated oyer major portions of its area, resulting in a loose pebbly surface, and one in urgent need of resealing. The main standing consisted originally of 4' broken brick carpeted with i' gravel macadam mix and has recently been covered by 6' - 9' stone pitching, (random pitching) with a 1' gravel macadam running carpet. It is estimated that the bearing capacity of the standings and of the northern 1000 metres of the runway is such that a 60,000 lbs. aircraft on 2 wheels may safely use them - it is not possible to give even a nominal bearing value for the southern half of the runway, as this is rapidly dis-Integrating; with constant watching and day and night repair facilities available, it shcu be possible to operate aircraft from it, but arrangements must be instantly available to divert aircraft in case of unusual rainfall, or an increase in the rate of failure.DC 88050/1 V 15 ~ Vic. The method of reconstruction of the southern half of the runv/ay discussed with the Director of the Port of Basrah and his engineer^ and there is no doubt that they fully appreciate the danger of the present position, and will take energetic measures to execute the reconstruction. This will probably take the fonm of a sand—bitumen mix waterproof coat over the existing runway, covered by a sand cushion, stone pitching and macadam or sand bitumen top carpet. Materials and plant for such a job are available locally, and the time of construction will probably be about 2 months (working 24 hours a day) during which time traffic will either be diverted to Shaibah, or use a prepared strip alongside the runway, and diverging from it a few degrees so as to make maximum use of the sound northern, end (some filling in of the end legs of two drainage channels will be necessary to achieve this strip.) 5 • Shou lder s to runways No work has been undertaken to provide fimed up shoulders to the runways and it is thought that little short of full runway construction would suffice - at the present time these are so soft that a man sinks in about 1'. Stabilisation with sand and gravel, combined with drainage, might produce some appreciable results, but the opinion of an expert in soil mechanics is necessary. 6«x Proposed Const ructio n Plan 2 attached to this report shows 3 proposed runways; there is no doubt that the energetic Port authorities could construct them in spite of the heavy engineering works involved (bridging of creeks, etc.) but the cost and time factor will be considerable. It is considered that, following discussions v.ith M.C.A. representatives, the tentative proposals have been reduced to the provision of one runway; the time for construction of this would be over 2 years. /. Wor ks S ervices All work is undertaken by the Chief Engineer, to the Basrah Port Authority. 23. 1. 47.DC 88030/1 16 APPENDIX B M.C.A. Par East Technical Survey Me t eorolqgical Section Part I - G ene ral Report Basrah 1&gt; General A meeting was held at Basrah on 25 th January between the Port Director and the Chief Engineer of the Port of Basrah, the Chief Airport Controller and the M.C.A. Survey Party. Later on the 25 th, discussions took place with the Chief Airport Controller, with the N.C.O. in charge, R.A.F. Meteorological Section, Basrah and with the Chief Observer of the Iraqi Meteorological Section at Basrah. 2. Existing facilities All forecasts are obtained from the Meteorological Office at R.A.F. Station, Shaibah which is itself dependent on Habbaniyah for forecasts. The forecasts are written out on appropriate Air Ministry forms (F.21-03 or 2330 according '.o the route) and handed to the aircrew. One chart is drawn daily on F.2803 for 0001 G.M.T. There were relatively few observations plotted on the charts which were examined. Analyses issued by Habbaniyah are used to assist in drawing up the charts. Occasionally a chart for 1200 G.M.T. may be r* drawn. All synoptic information for the charts (except that for Basrah and Nasiriah) is obtained from Shaibah. The work detailed in this paragraph is carried out by the R.A.F. meteorological section. The Iraqi meteorological section maintains the observing routine, wind tabulations, climatological returns etc. Weather reports for Basrah, together with upper wind reports when available, are broadcast on the beacon frequency in Q code (i.e. QAM and QA0) at HH + 30 from 0330 until 1330 G.M.T. Reports in Q code are also issued on request. There is a direct telephone from the meteorological office, Basrah to R.A.F. Shaibah exchange. A meteorological teleprinter circuit is installed between the meteorological office Shaibah and Basrah. There is also an automatic civil telephone. t There is no W/T reception of meteorological broadcasts or point-to-point meteorological circuit. The accommodation consists of one forecast room and one observers* room which are located on the 1st and 2nd floor of the terminal building* Access from the forecast room to the observers’ room is by means of a spiral staircase. The two rooms are vertically below the controllers’ office which is on the 3rd floor. One corporal and two L.A.C’s form the R.A.F. section. There are four Iraqi observers, of whom one has just completed his training. 3• Projected change s There are no firm plans, on the civil side, for changing the existing organisation but it is understood that financial provision for establishing a civil meteorological organisation at Basrah is to be included in the budget which is now being prepared by the Chief Airport Controller for the financial year 19 A 7 / 8 . 4- Implementation of Pi cao procedures No plans exist for the implementation of the Picao procedures recommended at the Cairo regional meeting. The Chief Airport Controller is aware, in general terms, of the meteorological commitments involved in these procedures;DC 88050/1 17 5« R eoanmendations and conclusions ^To provide meteorological service approximating to Picao st.andards ths provision of forecasters and the institution of more comprehensive charting programme at Basrah appears to be necessary. No detailed report on Basrah is being submitted. At Basrah. 28th January, 1947. IDC 38030/1 18 BASRAH - MARGIL APPENDIX C __ x The following information was supplied by the Chief Airport Controller to the Port of Basrah Directorate, Mr. J. Malcolm, and B.O.A.C. Station Superintendent, Mr. Ryan. * 'I* Air Traffic Control 1.1 General Air traffic control in common with the other technical services, is the responsibility of the Port Directorate. This has resulted in the establishment. c an^efficiently run, and adequately staffed approach and aerodrome control organisation. Control for the aerodrome and flying boat alighting area is exercised from one control tower situated centrally between and immediately adjacent to both. The control launch, manned by B.O.A.C., controls final approach and take-offs of flying boats, and is in lamp signal liaison with the tower. VHP R/T liaison will very shortly be introduced (the equipment is expected daily). VHP r/t is also to be fitted to the lead-in van. Continuous watch is kept, and present movements average 20 daily. There are nc R.A.P. nersonnel on the aerodrome. So far, no steps have been taken towards implementation of the area control for the Basrah Plight Safety Region recommended at Cairo, but future planning takes into account this international responsibility. ry 1.2 Personnel There are 4 watch keeping control officers under the supervision of he Chief Airport Controller who is directly responsible to the Port Directorate. The control officers are Iraqis, but their educational background is of a relatively high order. A well planned system of promotion on experience and merit has achieved a team of efficient controllers, all with several years experience in control. They have functioned continuously through the war on a civil basis. The B.O.A.C. Station Supeiintendent states that pilots comments on control are invariably avourable. I confirmed this with B.O.A.C. crews passing through. The control launch crews similarly spoke well of the liason with the tower. PICAO procedures and documents are circulated to the control staff, and are j-v, 6 oas ^ s 0: f system followed. The’airport Controller recognises that t e staff will need to be augmented to meet future commitments, and a suitable pool for recruiting exists in the form of experienced clerks Who have been working in the tower in conjunction with the control officers. Languages in use are English and Arabic. 1.3 Acc ommc da t i pn and Equipment '/S ihe control tower is of sound basic design permitting unobstructed j :kj vision of the circuit. Half the main runway .and the touch down point of runway 13 are, however, obstructed by a hangar. To overcome this, aircraft movements in the 'blind' sector are co-ordinated by a lead in van (to be fitted with VHP R/t) and there is very little increased hazard on this account. The tower is well equipped, with the exception of H/T. At present 6A4C K/cs. is used, but it is hoped to supplement this with i.P R/T on 120.3 mcs. and 116.1 mcs. in the near future. (See Tels. report.) An efiicient system of airfield lighting is installed and control is from a master panel in the tower. Other equipment is as follows:- Portable directional signalling lamp. Wind speed and direction indicator. Pyrotechnics. xill control communications between the H/T station and control are passed over the teleprinter with checking by direct telephone. QMS's are passed as necessary from the meteorological observer in a room immediately below the tower.DC 88050/1 19 I.if- Conclusions Tho overall impression is.one of efficiency. The Port Directorate are keen to see the airport develop internationally, v/ith a steady civil traffic flow, and intend to provide all the technical services this will require. Several international air lines already use the airport regularly. 2. Search and Rescue No search aircraft are available at Margil, The nearest centre for air search is Habbaniya. There are also 3 Iraqi Air Force .Aisons normally based at Baghdad, and one R.^.F, Anson at Shaibah. Desert police can be called upon for desert rescue, and sea rescue facilities include the resources of the Port Directorate (launches, pilot vessels, harbour craft and sea going craft.) tDC 88030/1 20 BASRA Appendix D SKAIBAH AND AJBADAN 2A-29th January, 1947 TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND -'JEN’UDIO ASPECTS 1 • General 1.1 In addition to interviews with the personalia noted in the main report technical discussions took place v/ith:- (Mr» Harrison, Chief Radio Engineer, Basrah Port Authority.

A study of the available meteorological data showed that the main runway alone would give sufficient annual coverage to meet the requirements of aircraft capable of operating with a limiting cross wind component of 15 m.p,h. The airfield lies on an open gravel plain some 15 miles west of Basrah. All the approaches are unobstructed-. The airfield is linked to Basrah by a sand bitumen military road. The main runway has a bearing capacity of 80,000 lbs. and is readily extendable at its north western end. It was estimated that this runv/ay could be extended to PICA0 Class 0 lengths to accomodate Tudor II's in 3 months time, at an estimated cost of ,025,000. To develop it to full PI0A0 Glass 0 standards /ould taxe 9 months, and cost -2210,000. To develop the airfield to full Class B standards v/ould take 15 months, and cost 2570&gt;000, The airfield could be extended to Class A lengths if required, without difficulty. 2. Accom modation The domestic accommodation consists of an R.A.F. Officers Mess, with V.I.P. accommodation for 28 and plus 100 rooms equipped to officer status.

This runway is in excellent condition, and is suitable for the operation of aircraft up to 80,000 lbs. x )r °vided rather sharp changes in gradient' are acceptable; these are certainly greater than those recommended for FICA0 standards, but it is understood that the mission is prepared to recommend their acceptance for. Tudor II aircraft. Flan I attached gives spot levels along the runway edges. 2. Sub-soil The sub-soil is a naturally occurring gravel sand mixture with a strong cementitious binder; its depth is considerable, certainly over 10 ft,, it over- lies rock, and makes an excellent foundation for runways. 3. D rainage C Crossfalls on the aerodrome are such that surface water run off can be achieved on all parts of the field, except on an area close to the Control Tower; this area has been adequately drained by'the sinking of a soak-way 30 ft, diameter atid 20 ft, deep, at which depth it is in porous rock, believed to be limestone. Any scheme to improve the gradients on the runway would interfere considerably with the natural run off from the airfield, and would involve considerable works service; it is for this reason that it is recommended that present gradients be accepted for Tudor II operation, and that alteration for gradient be incorporated in any major scheme approved to provide Class C or Class B facilities, 4. Standings The hard standing area to the northwest of the airfield is constructed in 6' unreinforced concrete and is suitable for use by 80,000 lbs. aircraft. The taxi track 50 ft. wide is of 3' consolidated depth sand bitumen mix laid directly on the soil, but there are a few concrete revving up areas incorporated at the ends-of the strips and runway, 5. Shoulders to runways ^ It is considered that the bearing capacity of the soil is such that special preparation of the shoulders is not required. 6. Extension to take Tudor 1 1*3 and to P ICA O Class C and B sta ndards No engineering difficulties are involved in the lengthening of the runway to take Tudor II’s or in the strengthening, lengthening and widening to runways, taxi tracks, and standings, to meet Class G and 3 requirements.

Rec ommendations and co ncl usions If Shaibah becomes a major staging post on the main trunk route through to • India^and beyond, it will be necessary to examine the requirements for R.A.F. and civil aircraft and to formulate a suitable organisation in the light of conditions prevailing at that time, having due regard to R.A.F. and M.C.A. polic'f for future development. 6 , No detailed report for Shaibah is being submitted. At Basrah. 28th January, 1947. DC 88030/1 26APPENDIX C SHAIMH Tha follcwing information v/as obtained from the Duty Control Officer at Shaibah. 1. Air Traffic Control 1,1. General This is an R.A.F. station, adequately equipped, but somewhat below strength. It is suggested that if civil aircraft are to increase their use of the aerodrome two more civil controllers should be added to supplement present staff. Owing to its isolation and climatic conditions, efficiency soon becomes impaired by unduly long working hours. On the otter hand, movements are infrequent at present (of the order of 10 per day). Approach and aerodrome control are pro vided on a dawn to dusk basis, but the tower is never vacated, and a control officer is always on call for emergency night landings# There is no intention of reducing the facilities, so far as is known. 1,2. Personnel Present strength is as follows 3 Plying Control Officers (2 about to be demobilised). 3 Airfield Controllers. 2 Plying Control Assistants. 1.3. Accommodation and Equipment The control tower is well planned with unobstructed vision, and is equipped' as follows D/p 3/T 6i+AO K/cs. VHP P/T 116,1 117.9 and 120.96 iv^/cs. Aldis Lamps, pyrotechnics. Sensitive altimeters, A wind speed and direction indicator is shortly to be installed. The runway caravan is manned from dawn to dusk. 2. Search an d R es cue Apart from one Anson, search aircraft are normally requested from Habbaniya. The Army at Shaibah provide a desert rescue squad with suitable vehicles and communications equipment. DC 88050/1 27DC 88050/1 28 APPENDIX D SHAIEAH The P.A.P. Aeradio organisation is to full Transi^ort Gomand Staging Post standards as regards available facilities. The lack bf personnel is however acute and only limited service can be provided. ^.1. As with other like locations on the main Civil Air Routes, it is unsound go plan Civil Air Services dependant on service facilities. The Civil Air Route Organisation is now far advanced in planning and implementation and no advantage can accrue from basing our short or long term requirements on the service facilities at Shaibah. 1.2, In the event of Shaibah being designated as a main or diversionary loca tion for the Trunk Route services - only localised communication and short range navigational aids would be required from the Civil aspect. V -v ^? flcient P oint to Point facilities exist between Shaibab/llabbaniyah and Shaibah/Basra to enable control to be exercised from Basra for Civil Air services, i.4.

It has two bitumen macadam runways as under:- NNW - SSE 7,000 ft. long x 150 ft. wide. SW - HE 6,000 ft. long x 150 ft. wide. These runways were only ccmpleted approximately a year ago, and are in excellent condition. They have a designed bearing strength of 120,000 lbs. but it is estimated that they could quite safely carry loads of 200,000 lbs. Using a PICA0 density altitude of 3*100 ft. it was calculated that a runway 6,814 ft. would be required to meet PICA0 Class 0 requirements. It was agreed, therefore, that from the point of view of runways, Dhahran meets PICA0 Class 0 standards as it stands - further development to PICA0 Class B standards could be achieved, as both runways are readily extendable. A runway length of 8,085 ft. would be needed to meet PICA0 Class B requirements, and it is estimated that it would cost £350,000 to extend the existing runways. This estimate takes into account widening the main runway by 50 ft. It was considered necessary to base this estimate on full instrument runway conditions, since a study of the available meteorological data showed that during the summer, and even sometimes during the winter, the airfield was frequently subject to local rising sand, which was capable of reducing visibility to less than 500 yards. n 2 • Accommo datio n As was already known, there is very little accommodation on this airfield. The Americans have, however, recently converted a hospital to accommodate 25 night stopping passengers for TWA, but it is doubtful if this accommodation would be available to B.O.A.C. It it was found necessary to use Dhahran on the trunk service, it would be essential to erect some sort of temporary accommoda tion for emergency night stops. There is a terminal building, which, although small, is well equipped and air conditioned. There is one small hangar on the airfield capable of housing aircraft of the Dakota Class, but nothing larger. 3. Airf ield Light ing There is a standard American electric flare path installed on both runways. There is no approach lighting. 4. Con clus io ns an d Rec omme ndation s Since this airfield meets PICA0 Class C standards from the point of view of runways, it could obviously be used by Tudor II’s. However, the additional problems involved in operating Tudor II’s from this airfield would be considerable - accommodation, spares, maintenance, re-fuelling, etc. , would all have to be arranged, and it is thought that the .Americans may well prove unwilling to help much in this respect. (Note. The A.I.O.C. Oil Company expressed an interest in the possibility of our running British aircraft through Dhahran, since at the moment all the fuel installations on the airfield are American. It appears that there is an old treaty which gives Britain the right to instal her own petrol installations at any place in this area, should she so desire, and it was pointed out to us that if we were to give the British Oil Companies concerned, sufficient notice of our intentions at Dhahran, they would be willing to instal British re-fuelling facilities on the airfield. This might well be a point to follow up, since it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the Americans would re-fuel their own aircraft first, in preference to British aircraft, should there at any time be a build up of aircraft on the station.)DHAKRAN APPENDIX A DC 88030/1 30 Engineering Aporeciation 1. General Tv/o runways ( 7-,000 ft. long on bearing 3 A 5 ° and 6,000 ft. on bearing 245 ° each 150 ft. wide) with their associated-taxi tracks (each 60 ft. wide) and about 20,GOO yds. super of standings, were completed by American A.A.P. engineers in January, )94o, close to the site of an earlier R.A.F. airfield. Camp facilities as noted in the general report, were completed at the same time. 2 *. S ub S oil The sub soil is rock outcropping at many points, and over laid by only a few feet ol laterite and sand; this rock appeared to be hard limestone, and was used 1 or macadam work on the runways and for building construction. 3. Runways , Taxi Tracks an d St andings Certain parts oi these are constructed on rock; on all other parts the minimum construction was stated to be to a total depth of 22 ' made up of 4 ' premix macadam (machine laid) on 6 ' crushed rock, which in turn was on a minimum of 12 of thoroughly consolidated (wet) laterite; in all cases when this laterite was not i ounded on rock it was taken down to such a depth as to reach 1 irm well graded sand. Only limited consolidation of shoulders has been unde^* taken at places where drift sard was encountered. ^It must be recorded that the above information was given verbally on site, and that it v/as impossible to obtain any check on it from record drawings. nil suriaces are in excellent condition, and indicate first class workmanship; the application of a seal coat this summer will finally complete the job. All surfaces will safely carry a 133,000 lbs, aircraft, and, I consider, a 200,000 lbs. aircraft; since the original basis of design was stated to be 120,000 lbs. and the field is under American Control, it would be essential to obtain the concurrence of the appropriate American authorities to this higher loading. 4. Pos sib le Extensions From a physical point of view, both runways can be extended to Class B lengths with a slight change in gradient at the north end of the 3450 runway - uhe existing runways are practically level. The execution of such extensions would present considerable difficulties as the American construction force has been withdrawn together with its serviceable equipment. The introduction of Contractors organisation and plant would, therefore, be necessary, resulting in disproportionately high costs lor a small amount of work; furthermore, American anu oo.udi ijrabian interests would have to be taken into consideration. Very approximately the costs for provision of Class B facilities on 3450 runway would be:- ... To extend one runway to 8,083 ft. and widen to 200 ft., extend one taxi track and widen it to 80 ft. (all in construction similar to existing). £ 330,000 Time would be about 9 months. Alternatively, runway extended in length only could be executed with a comparatively minor organisation at a cost of: £ 100,000 It is suggested tTiat the field be accepted as fulfilling Class C requirements, even with taxi track width of 60 feet. 3.2.47.DC 88050/1 31 APPENDIX M.C.A. Fa r E ast Technical Su rvey Meteoro logic al Section Part I - General Repo rt Dhahran 1. General Phahran v;as visited on 31st January, 1947* and the following information obtained from the T.W.A. meteorologist, Mr. Odell. 2. Existing Fac ilit ies The staff consists of two forecasters:- Mr. Fox - a 'civilianised' American Army meteorologist. Mr. Odell - T.W.A. meteorologist. 3 Italian observers. 3 ' W/T operators. Charts are drawn for 00 and 12 G.M.T. U.S.A.A.F. charts are us.ed, which cover an area from Tunis to Calcutta, and the Crimea to the equator. On those charts which were seen, there was a fairly large amount of synoptic data. Observations are made as follows:- Synoptics. Hourly from 0400 to 0700 G.M.T. ) ' ' 0900 ' 1200 ' ) inclusive. ' ' 1400 ' 1800 ' ) Pibals at 0400 and 1500 G.M.T. Forecasts are obtained from T.W.A. at Payne Field and issued on forms which are very similar to PICA0 form shown as Appendix D-1 to PICaO Procedures for Air Navigation Services - Meteorology - 2nd Edition - august, 1946. The accommodation consisting of two rooms is located in the main terminal building. * There is one W/T receiver for reception of meteorological broadcasts. Synoptic data was also received from T.W.A. at Payne Field. 3* Projected Cha ng es It was intended that as from a date very early in February, 1947; forecasts would be prepared and issued by Dhahran. PICA0 procedures v/ould be introduced, and weather reports for aircraft in flight would be issued on METAR code. Dhahran would prepare route forecasts for the route Habbaniya to Dhahran, and Dhahran to Karachi, with terminal forecasts for Habbaniya, Basrah, Dhahran, and Karachi. The forecasts would be in NAMET code, and issued twice daily at 0400 and 1600 G.M.T., covering periods (both route and terminal forecasts) 0400 - 2200 and 1600 - 1000 G.M.T. These messages would not be broadcast, but would be addressed to T.W.A. at Payne Field and Bombay. The two forecasters intended to maintain a 24 hour watch. T.W.A. were being a^ked by Mr. Odell for a third forecaster, but as Mr. Fox was due to leave Dhahran at the end of May, it is doubtful whether there v/ould be 3 forecasters there for any appreciable time. It was intended to make hourly observations throughout the 24 hours as soon as possible.DC 88050/1 52 4. The Americans hoped to train Saudi-Arabians as observers, and intended to atcempt to increase the numbers of observations available frcm Saudi Arabia. Im p 1 ement ation of P_ICaO procedures it will be noted from para. 3 above that it was intended to introduce PICAO procedures early in February, 1947. The route and terminal forecasts will be sent to T.//.A. offices at Bombay, .and Payne Field. There was no mention ol their being sent to any other interested meteorological offices, and no request was made that they should be so addressed. 9. Recommendations an d Con clusions The meteorological office is able to issue forecasts lor flights to Cairo, Jedda, and Karachi or Bombay. Mr, Odell was quite co-operative, and said they would be willing to exchange data with any of the other meteorological offices, which would be to the mutual advantage of one another. At Karachi. 5.2.47.88050/1 33 DHAHRAN APPEKDIX C The following infomation v/as obtained from discussion with T.W.A. Chief Communications Officer, Mr. J. P. Anderton at Dhahr&amp;n on 31st Januaiy, 1947. Air Traffic Control Approach and aerodrome control is exercised by American civil radio operator cum air traffic control staff (employed by T.W.A. )• The duties are combined, and the Control Room is also the W/T and R/T operating rocm. This economy in personnel appeared to be achieving successful results, though it is - considered that an increase in traffic flow will require separate staff. The system in use is that the Control Room maintains a continuous listening watch, and exercises approach control. When an aircraft is about to take off, and some minutes prior to E.T.-A. of in-coming aircraft, the Control Tower is manned additionally, and aerodrome control is exercised by R/T, which is monitored in the Control Room. The personnel employed appear to be of a very high order of competency. The tower is of standard TRS.A.A.F. pattern, and fully equipped, including: - h/P r/t VHP R/T (Receive 6440 Kc/s , Continuously available ( ( 116.1 Transmit (2000 - 1200Z (1200 - 2000Z vie/ s.

Search and Rescue No aircraft are based at Dhahran, and air search organisation is non existent. Per desert rescue, an ambulance is permanently available, which is equipped with rescue gear, and communications apparatus. A launch is available for Gulf rescue. In view of the lack of air search aircraft, the absence of navigational aids, and emergency landing grounds, and the barren nature of the territory, the direct route Cairo/Lydda - Dhahran/Bahrein cannot be recommended for safe operation.DC 88050/1 34 APPENDIX D ' PERSIA GULP BAHREIN ) DHi'JtHiiN ) TolcocggDUnieatione and ^orr.dio Aspects ) ijrmQxurcs : - 'A 1 - Aide Memoire dated 7*2.47 on interim Main Staging post point to point organisation. 1. GENERt'Jj 1.1. The general picture of the Civil Aeradio facilities available and required for Trunk Route purposes in this area is confused both as regards the method of operation and as to the best available location. 1.2. Broadly speaking, it is a combination of three systems and other than taking immediate a.ction for certain facilities required to give essential services at the moment. Action such as is outlined in 2.1.4 seems the only feasible long term solution. 1.3* Operationally, there is a requirement for a centralisation of the Acradio facilities for A.T.C. MET etc. either at Bahrein or Dharhan, with Basra exercising the long range function. 1.4. The absence of a comprehensive Control and Met organisation in the area calls for more direct linkage with such locations as CAIRO and KARACHI than would otherwise appear necessary. The matter was raised during the CAIRO P. I.C.A.0. deliberations and the recommendations made there assumed certain factors which may or may not materialise for some time to come. 1.3* Bearing these facts in mind, effort has been concentrated in:- 1.5.1* Establishing essential point to Point linkage for interim use (sec 2.2.) 1.5.2. Assessing existing facilities and requirements from an area view point, rather than for each particular location, with a view to mrking a recommendation which would effect centralisation and serve all Civil Aeradio requirements as far as they are foreseeable. 1.6. The necessity of discussions with the Indian D.C.C.A’s department and talks with the relevant American Opera.tives, delayed the compilation of this report until these could be completed at Ka.ra.chi. 2. ASSESSMENT OP REQUIREMENTS 2.1. Long Ter m: Reference to the General survey report on this area and the SUMMARY’ on the route Lydda to Karachi shows that the conclusion reached to recommend BASRA as the main Long Range Communication Centra (See BASRA report 5.3) is ba.sic for the Persian Gulf area. 2.1.1. The use of DHARHAN by long range services either British or American will not, in the main, preclude the success of 2.1 since adequate signalling coverage is assured but influences the telecommunications conclusions regarding BAHREIN. 2.1.2. The Americans already find the need to join the existing Civil aviation Long Range Point to Point network and, at talks held at Karachi, it v/as appa.rent that co-ordination of their fa.cilities with ours and those of the relevant Governments on lines recommended by the CACRO P. I.C.^. 0. documents is rapidly being forced upon all concerned. * liny step taken in this direction appears highly desirable if duplication or even triplication, vdth consequential obvious difficulties, is to be avoided in the Aeronautical Telecommunications Organisation for this Region.p _ - ’‘N 3. v 2.1.3. From a Telecoms, viewpoint, the close proximity of DEuRHAN and B^iHREIN allows centralisation of the main Aeradio facilities at one or the other, with localised communications and navigational aids for each. The policy aspect hoy/ever may well be the deciding factor. It has been assumed that BAHREIN will best meet British requirements. 2.1. q-. i'rom the discussions held, it is recommended that the following main outline be adopted; 2*1.4.1. Centrali sation of Aeradio facilities at Bahrein in one main Aeradio station operated on Agency basis to the scale outlined in para. 3.1.6. 2.1. A. 2. Ac tion t o be init iated to secure the operation of existing facilities at Dharhan (Sec 4.4.5) on the Cairo P. I.C.A.O. International Civil Aviation frequencies, thus allowing their use by all civil aircraft as necessary. 2.2. S hor t Tom: 2.2.1. The visit to Dharhan revealed that the American operatives required direct linkage with Karachi. The desirability of such facilities had already been raised by T.W.A. but there were some objections, based mainly on the Cairo P.I.C.A.0. recommendations. 2.2.2. From the Met and CONTROL aspects, the direct linkage of KARACHI - - LYDDii. - BAHREIN and BaSRu was a basic Telecoms, requirement for British Air Services. 2.2.3. 10 give support to 2.2.-1 appeared highly desirable (see 2.1.2) and action was taken on arrival at Karachi to secure its implementation. .unncxure ’iM to this report is an iALde ivlemoire propcared at Karachi during the^ negotiations and gives the main outline. Final agreement and implementing c.ction will be secured a,t Delhi. All concerned expressed agreement in principle and urge that this scheme be implemented by 1st March 1947 as an interim step in the Long range „eradio network for the area. BAHREIN 3.1.

P. at MUHARRAQ is extremely proble matical. Personal problems preclude anything other than the barest minimum watches being maintained. 3*1.5.2. The continuance of the complex arrangements outlined in paras. 3.1.1 to 3*1*3 is highly undesirable and it is strongly Recommended that a centralised Aeradio organisation be established, operated on an agency basis and serving Aeradio requirements only. 3*1*5.3* A Royal Naval p/T transmitting station is at present lying inoperative on a care* and maintenance basis and should be taken into consideration as a probable facility that could be usefully employed. 3.1.6. Facilities Required ^ 3.1*6.1. Assuming that BASRAH becomes the main long range Aeradio Centre Persian Gulf area, the following facilities are required at BAHREIN to cover existing Plying Boat services and existing and probable landplane services:- 3.1.6.2.

Requircmcnts 4.6.1. Direct linkage vdth KARACHI on C/A Pt. to Pt. network. 4.6.2. Bearing in mind the designation ox’ DHAKHAN as a Long Range Inter national Airport and the establishment at BASRA of long range Aeradio facilities under the CAIRO P.I.C.^.C. findings, it is strongly recommended that action be initiated to secure the operation of the facilities outlined in 4.5.1 on International Civil Aviation frequencies. adequate coverage can then be provided for Civil aircraft using or overflying DHARHAN and co ordination with BAHREIN will bo automatically assured. 4.7. Personal difficulties exist, but sufficient equipment is available to meet our requirements. 4.8. as far as could bo ascertained, there v/ould be no technical objections to the installation of Radar ^.ids such as Eureka and Babs Ivlk.II if so desired for British ^dr Services. The airfield is ideal for the use of such aids. . 5.0. SILJRJAK 5.1. The visit to Sharjah was from a Telecoms aspect influenced by the discussions at Bahrein and in light of action taken in London regarding the Civil Aeradio facilities, prior to the Survey Party’s departure. 'A 5.2. It was known that the R.a.F. intention was to retain SHARJAH to normal Transport Command Radio facilities. I 5.3. The Political Resident at BAHREIN had pointed out that the maintenance of the Civil Aeradio Station at SHAEJAi was part of the existing agreement and desired action for its continuance, ss an interim measure, pending a final decision. Further the Point to Point system linking to Karachi and Bahrein is used as a Cable and Wireless xagency in addition to A;radio commitments. 5.4. Investigation on the spot revealed that the R.A.F., due to personnel difficulties, can only maintain, at the present, the barest minimum facilities (see 5.8.1). Discontinuance of the Civil Air/Ground and Point to Point channels would seriously affect Aeradio Conimunications for Air services on the Bahrein- Karachi route. 5.5» The closure of the Aeradio facilities at MASIRAH is a further very important consideration when reviewing the intermediary signalling points available to air craft in this area. f 5.6. Accordingly, a signal was made to M.C.A. and B. O.A.C. London for interim authority to continue the operation of this station. , t ft 5.7. Concurrence with the recommendation contained in 5*6. is most strongly urged. Cessation of the Civil facilities at this location may be serious and to I re-establish at a later date would involve many difficulties. 5 . 8 . Existing Facilities 5.8.1. Royal Air Force. 5.8.1.1.

GENERAL 1.1. An Aide Memoire (copy attached herewith) was prepared and circulated for discussion. 1.2. It was agreed that the proposed additional network to the existing Civil Aviation channels was considered sufficient to meet the Operators* immediate requirement and was in general concord with plans of D.G.C.A. Dept. India and P.I.C.A.O. recommendations. 1.3* Discussion revealed that a further 'breaking down* of the network may be necessary in the light of operational experience, but that the outline given in the Aide Memoire was satisfactory for the present. 1.4. The Chairman asked if the procedure for implementation of the facilities as ou’fcli.ftcd the Aide Memoire was acceptable. It was decided to proceed on those lines. 2. TRAFFIC TO BE HANDLED The talks centred on the operational function of the circuit. A rough assessment of the MET traffic to be passed was given and the following points agreed after D.G.C.A's Representative had warned the meeting of the necessity for such limitations. 2.1. The circuit to be designated 'Aeradio Operational Point to Point Circuit' and to be utilised for the passing of essential control traffic, terminal to terminal Met. information as defined in Cairo P.I.C.A.O. Doc and emergency amendments thereto, and such other operational traffic as the load ing will permit. 3* The meeting agreed to proceeding with discussions at Delhi for final con currence of D.G.C.A. Dept, and for initiating action as outlined in the Aide Memoire. 3.1. The representatives of P.A.A. expressed their concurrence and stated that the facilities suggested met their immediate requirements.*4 % (w) AIDE jjlEutO I RE Civil Aviation Operational Point to Point Facilities - Area Eastern Mediterranean tc India A me rare f A S? 1. GENERAL 1.1. ii Biitish Ministry of Civil Aviation Survey party has recently surveyed the route facilities extant in the area mentioned above. It was clearly apparent that a minimum reinforcement of the main staging post and terminal point to point facilities was necessary. This was due, in the main, to the time factor involved in implementing of the Cairo P.I.C.A.O. Civil aviation recommendations and to the very rather limited Met and operational control facilities available. 1 . 2 . During the visit to Dharhan, a request was received for direct communication Kaiachi/Dharhan on behalf of American operators. 1.3. On arrival at Karachi,- the Tels. Adviser to the M.C.A. Survey Mission and the Regional Signals Officer, B.O.A.C. approached the D.G.C.A's Department local official for his views on the point to point requirements. 1.4. It.was early revealed that in addition to the British operators’ request there were additional requests from American operators. 1.f. The D.G.C.A’s Deptt: India had already formulated -an outline plan for just such point to point organisation working from India westwards. 1 ’v‘ ^ eTe exists &gt; at the moment, long range Civil Aviation net-work operating on s v U ? Basis linking many of the relevant locations and a short range interstage net-work linking all intermediary points. 1 .7. The frequencies employed are dangerously over-loaded from an operation view point and the creation of an additional main staging post net-work appeared the only solution. 2. ACTION INITIATED t'o ' discussion 5 agreement was reached to signal Air headquarters of the D.G.C.A s department in Delhi for agreement in principle for the opening of an independent operational Civil Aviation Point to Point medium, stage channel from Karachi linking Basra, Lydda, Dharhan and/or Bahrein Cairo and Ankara. The suggested frequencies are 10935, 8140, 3670 Kcs. operating on continuous basis with scheduied times for normal traffic. The existing long range networx on f s 5&gt; 12^1^, 9310 and 4145 Kcs. to be retained for terminal to terminal working such as Cairo, Karachi, Calcutta, Colombo, Rangoon, Singapore, Hongkong, with variations as operational commitments decide. * 2 -2. Advice has been received that D.G.C.A’s Department Delhi agrees in principle and the discussions will be pursued for immediate implementation within a few days at Delhi. 2.3. ix signal indicating the decisions already reached will be prepared for trans mission to all relevant authorities. 3. OTHER OPERATORS' REQUIREMENTS 3*1• Coincidental with the above negotiations, representatives of P.A.A. and T.W.A. arrived in Karachi to discuss their requirements. It was indeed fortunate that such an opportunity arose since it was clearly apparent that the operational need facilltles was common to all operators concerned and it presented to the n.G.C.A s Department an opportunity to implement an International Civil Aviation Point to Point facility on a common basis. The desirability of provision of these facilities in this manner affords an immediate opportunity of implementation of agreed P.I.C.A.O. International ‘policy. 4. CONCLUSIONS . is &gt; therefore, desired that the representatives of Operators concerned review the negotiations and plans outlined above and indicate their'concurrence. The ietaiis of the operational procedure to be adopted, the assessment of average raffic loads and the probable efficiency of the freauencies chosen to be left to the responsible technicians. % Karachi, ?th February, 1947DC 88050/1 43 ABADAN 1. This airfield lies approximately 30 miles down river from Basrah, and is in Persian territory. It has A runways as follows:- NW - SE NW - SS E - W NE - SW 7190 ft. long by 120 ft. wide.) pl 6020 ft. long by 150 ft. wide.) J - draxxeJ - 4200 ft, long by 120 ft. wide. 2750 ft. long by 120 ft. wide. This airfield lies in a flat open stretch of country. The approaches are all unobstructed, with the exception of the NE end of the NE/SW runway, which is obstructed by high tension cables and W/T masts. Originally, the field was built by the Anglo Iranian 0i4 Company, for their own private aircraft. During the war, it was considerably extended, and developed by the Americans. For full details see Appendix A. The 2 long runways are both capable of extension up to 10,000 ft. but their load bearing capacity would have to be greatly increased before they could be used for our purposes. 2. General Although at first sight, this airfield appeared to offer several advantages *»- over Basrah, investigations showed that, in fact, this was not so. The runways are in extremely poor condition, and there would appear to be very little hope of their being reconditioned, either by the Iranian Government or the A.I.0*C. The A.I.O.C.’s attitude being that the existing runways are good enough for the light aircraft which they intend to operate, and they see no reason to develop them, their plan being merely to maintain such portions of the runways as are required for the operation of the Company's aircraft. The Iranian Government, although they have designated Abadan as an international airport, would seem to have no very clear cut policy regarding its future development or maintenance. The Persian D.G.C.A., Monsieur Chaffik, who met us on arrival, explained that he had very little money, and a very small staff allocated to him as yet, but he hoped to have an adequate supply of both after the Persian General Elections in March. He then went on to expound his rather grandiose schemes for the development of the airfield, when funds became available. However, subsequent conversations with Group Captain Hughes, the British Military Air Attache from Teheran, and Hr. Drake, the A.I.O.C. Commercial Manager, and Mr. Willoughby, the British Consul at Abadan, showed that very little reliance could be placed on Monsieur Chaffik's plans. It was the opinion of these well informed individuals that the airfield would gradually deteriorate under Persian management, as the American installations slowly depreciated; the Persians having neither the equipment nor technicians to maintain them. Therefore, since the airfield as it stood, was below PICAO Class C Standards, and there seemed very little likelihood of it oeing developed for several years to come, it was decided that there was no advantage to be gained by considering it further. This decision was coloured by the fact ohat the pa^ty had already visited Shaibah, where it was found that the existing airfield could be cheaply and rapidly developed to meet our trunk route requirements in this area.(,0 Abadan APPENDIX A Engineering Appreciation The original runways were constructed by the nnglo-Iranian Oil Company to serve their own light aircraft; these were three in number, each about 850 yards long of V' broken brick topped with 3” sand bitumen mix. These have since had several-seal coats, each«blinded with small gravel v/ell rolled in; the resulting runways are adequate for the Company's needs. During the war American forces extended the runway bearing approx. NW/SE to 7,200 feet by adding extensions at both ends of the original strip; these extensions were of 3' consolidated depth sand-bitumen mix laid direct on the soil. x They also constructed an additional runway in 3' sand-bitumen mix parallel to this extended runway and about 75 yards south west of it; this runway is approx. 6,000 feet long and is fitted with the American type of HILV lighting; which appeared to be completely unscrvicable. 2. Soil The soil is silt of the type found throughout the Tigris-Euphrates valley with a water table at a depth of 2 feet in winter and only slightly lower in summer. During rainstorms water has been known to lie on the airfield to a depth of 6' and last winter it was necessary to .'.bund' the runway to enable the Oil Company’s aircraft to use it. 3* Runways and Standings The original length of the extended runway is in good condition and will take a 26,000 pound aircraft but the extensions are in poor condition due to disintegration of the sand-bitumen mix, being virtually held together by the heavy seal coat; they cannot be relied upon to carry traffic in the wet season although they would stand up to occassional use in the dry season-in fact they cannot be considered as more than a dust palliative. The parallel runway is virtually a write-off. The shorter runways are suitable only for light aircraft of the Rapide class both from the point of view of length and load carrying capacity as they have not been maintained to the same standard as the longer runway. The standing at the northern perimeter of the field is of similar construction to the original portion of the long runway and has been well maintained and will^ take a 26,000 pound aircraft'. The only extension possible to runways, without introducing major river diversion works and upsetting Abadan town planning, is a northern extension of the main runway to virtually any reasonable length although resiting of a wire less station would be necessary if the total length exceeded about 10,COO feet. A* Conc lusions This airfield is safe only for emergency diversions in dry weather for aircraft of 44,000 pounds and above, up to a top limit of say 80,000 pounds. In view of the political difficulties attached to this site and the fact that equivalent facilities can be made available elsewhere at considerably less cost, estimates for development to Class C and Class B standards were not worked out. 28.1.47. x runway v/idth is 40 y^ s « DC 88050/1DC 88050/1 A5 APPENDIX B la.G.A. Par East Technical Survey lieteorol ogical Section Part I_ - General Report Ab adan i „ General • • A meeting was held at Abadan on 27th January between D.C.A.TRAN, (Mr. Chafik), the Civil Air Attache, British Embassy, Teheran, (G/C Hughes), officials of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the H.C.A. Survey Party. Existi ng facilities There are no meteorological facilities maintained by the Iranian Government at Abadan. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) have organised a series of brief weather reports in plain language from a number of their outstations. These reports are received through A.I.O.C. telephone channels and are used by the A.I.O.C. pilots. The A.I.O.C. terminal building is on the side of the airfield opposite from the Iranian Government terminal building. The D.C.A. stated that radio-sonde equipment which had been installed by the American authorities during hostilities had been removed by the Iranian authorities and placed in store in A-badan. V Pio.ieoted changes The D.C.A. has plans for establishing a forecast service in Teheran and Abadan. This is dependent on his obtaining authority to employ two foreign meteorological experts. He considered that the Iranian Government would look to America or the United Kingdom for these forecasters. A. Implem entation of Pi cao procedures No plans exist for the implementation of Picao meterorological procedures. 5. Recommendat ion s and conclusions In the event of Abadan becoming a major staging post on the trunk route through to India and beyond, it will be necessary to make arrangements for the * ' establishment of a main meteorological office at Abadan. 6. No detailed report on Abadan is being submitted. At Basrah. 28th January, 19A7.ABADAN APPENDIX C 1. Air Traffic Control Since the departure of the American forces, Air Traffic Control is virtually non-existent. There is an excellent tower with full equipment, but it is manned only spasmodically, and then by inexperienced Iranians. It was learned from the D.C.A. , however, that establishment has been approved for 12 Control Officers, 2 to be on watch at all times. Personnel are to be Iranians, and they are to be under instruction by either British or American flying control instructors. It is the intention ol the Iranian Government that Abadan shall bo developed into a long range regular airport, and while the proposed arrangements may produce satisfactory control, say one year after inception, the service in the intervening period cannot be expected to be t adequate. The scheme is to be put into effect within 3 months, therefore i is not recommended that British trunk route aircraft use this aerodrome regularly for at least 15 months, unless alternative control arrangements^ can be made. A similar situation'is believed to exist on the Telecoms, and i'iet. sides, for which see respective reports. i On suggesting training in U.K* for the prospective controllers, I was ^ informed by the D.C.A. that the policy to have training done in Iran had been fixed, but that he would consider sending the men abroad ior advanced courses when they have had scwe basic experience and instruction locally. I understand that negotiations for the transfer of the field and equipment from the American forces to the Iranian Government are at present in progress* The Anglo Iranian Oil Company, who use the aerodrome regularly have their own communications set up but do not exercise air traffic control. 2. Search an d Re scue No search and rescue organisation exists at present. ViDC 88050/1 47 APPENDIX D ABADAN 1.0. At Abadan Airport, the Anglc~Iranian Oil Company maintain their own aeradio communication system for their own aircraft services. Communication is mainly on 327 Kcs. and a fixed loop hi/i- D/E is available for short range homing. The service will continue until full Aeradio facilities are provided by the Iranians and probably afterwards. 1.1. The U.3.A.A.T.C. facilities installed at Abadan Airport ranain in toto with the exception of the teletype apparatus. ihe j.acilioies available are scheduled in 1.2« Sufficient equipment remains to implement full Civil International requirements but unless action is taken soon to nut the apparatus in order and regular maintenance instituted, its continuance may be doubted. 2.0. During talks with the D.C.A* Iraq? it was stated that negotiations were in progress to finalise the taking over of these facilities from the U.S« Authorities and the lack of skilled technical personnel ./as 3.0.

I As was already known before the Survey Party left England, the R.A.P. had prohibited aircraft v/eighing more than 40*000 lbs. from l using this airfield; our own investigations confirmed that this was, I in fact, a very necessary restriction. The bearing capacity of the l soil is extremely low, and any further development of this airfield is 1 out of the question. It was not, therefore, given further consideration. BAHREIN New Site - Hamala This site lies on the island of Manama, which is the main island of the group. An inspection showed that this site could be developed to meet the requirements.of a large civil airport. It lies on a flat plain v/ith very minor variations of level, . The approaches are all- unobstructed, and it was considered that a one runway lay out would give sufficient annual wind coverage to meet the requirements of air- ; craft capable of operating in v/inds giving a 15 m.p.h. cross wind com ponent. The R,A,F. engineers at Habbaniya had produced a proposed lay out for this site based on the standard R.A.P. V.H.B. design. It I provided for 3 runways at 60° to one another. If it is decided to develop this site in conjunction with the R.A.P., it is suggested that an entirely new design should be agreed with Air Ministry in London, as it is thought that a one runway lay out might very well meet R.A.P. as well as civil requirements. On a one runway lay out it was estimated that the airfield could be developed complete v/ith buildings etc., to PICA0 Glass C standards in . 2 years at a cost of £1,250,000. To develop it to PICA0 Class B standards would take 2^ years, and would cost £1,750,000, It could, if necessary, be extended to meet PICA0’Glass A runway lengths, if desired.BAHREIN APPENDIX A. 1 Engineering Appreciation Existing airfield on Huharra^ island 1, General This site is on water-logged sand, virtually at sea level; water table is 12” to 18' below ground level. The site is covered by a hard skin, of salt encrusted sand, but when this is broken, very little bearing capacity remains. 2. Drainage.

The estimated maximum capacity of the runway and standings is 14,000 lbs, aircraft, and it is not considered that it would prove economical to attempt further development of the field. Instead, the site proposed for development by the R.A.E. on Manama Island was inspected. The report on this follvws. 1, G enera l The development of this site v/as proposed by the Chief Engineer, A.M,Yv',D., Iraq Command, in his letter b r 5/7/C. dated 10th July 1946, addressed to the Dire ctor of Yorks, M.C.A., and full details of the physical charac teristics of the site are contained therein. This scheme .was based on a three runway lay out, and full perimeter track. It is understood that an investigation of the available meteorological data has disclosed that a one runway lay out would be acceptable, provided this runway was based on a bearing of-340° true, or as.close to this as is possible, 2 The site was examined-with this lay out in view, and it can be confirmed that the provision of facilities on this basis is feasible. Consideration given only to the minimum requirements of Civil Aviation - it may be that R.A.E, interests will be involved, and additional requirements may heave to be met. It is understood that the perimeter track adjoining the ends of the runway should be placed at the north east side of the runway, and that the hard stand ing, Control Tower, and administrative buildings should also be on this side of the airfield; from ay access point of view this is suitable. 3. Estimated Cost -and Time The estimated cost to provide runway and taxi track, hard standing, Control Tower, AdministrKtive buildings, etc,, to Class C requirements is £1,250,000, and the time involved for construction would be 2 years. The estimated cost for similar facilities to Class B standards is £1,750,000 and the estimated construction time would be 2-^ years. It should be noted in this connection that several miles of access road will have to be reconditioned. 4. Conclusion its development cannot be considered as a practical proposition. While the cost of provision of initir.l facilities on the proposed site on Manama Island is high, there is no doubt that a first class airfield could be provided, and that further development on this site if necessary, would be relatively simple and economical. rV he runway (7200 ft. long) and standing consist of single pierced steel Manama Is land,_(H amal a) The present site on Muharraq Island is useless for heavy aircraft, and DC 88050/1 50APPENDIX A.?

Personnel are at a bare minimum, and any increase in use of the airfield by civil aircraft will have to be met by civil staffing. The numbers of control personnel are:- Flying Control Officers nil. Airfield Controllers ,(N.C.O’s) 3 Hours of watch are from dawn to dusk, with night facilities on request. Movements average 5 per day, of which approximately 1% are R.A.F. The balance 4 ' present is mainly made up by allied military movements to the Far East. Civil aircraft flow is at an average rate of one aircraft per three days (B.O.A.C. do not at present use Muharraq). The tower is quite satisfactory, with good vision, and equipment includes:- H/F R/T 6440 K/cs. ) during control VHF R/T 116.1 M/cs. ) hours 117*9 M/cs. ) of watch. Aldis Lamps. Pyrotechnics.

Flyin g Boats The marine base is situated on the main island, roughly 2-J miles from Muharraq. Control for the alighting area is exercised by B.O.A.C., who ^ co-ordinate their instructions with the R.A.F. at Muharraq by direct telephone and monitoring on R/T (6440 K/cs). The station Operations Officer is responsible for control, and he mans the tower when aircraft are expected to land or take off. Final approach and take off clearance are given by the coxswain on the Control Tender, which is equipped with R/T. The tower is satisfactory, with 3^0° vision, and is equipped as follows:- H/F R/T 6440 K/cs. (only when aircraft are on take off or landing). Aldis Lamps. .* Pyrotechnics. Wind speed indicator. Sensitive Altimeter. Wind direction is obtained from the adjacent wind sock. 2 . Search and Rescue. Air Search and Rescue facilities for both land planes and flying boats are normally called for from Habbaniya. Muharraq has one Anson, but no Mae West, dinghies etc. Launches are available at the flying boat base, which are adequate for both bases. DC 8805 0/1SHARJAH - PLYING CONTROL q .

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.l. 17th April, 1947. My Dear Hay, p Would you pleas^refer to India Office endorsement No. Ext.507/47 of 11th March forwarding copies of the Report of the Technical Survey Party on aerodromes in the Persian Gulf. 2. I enclose herewith for your information an extract from the minutes of a meeting held to consider the Report on April 1st. We shall probably be approaching you officially before long in regard to conclusion (6). It seems that there is a good case in principle for the construction of a first class aerodrome at Hamala, but the main stumbling block is likely to be the question of expense. It occurred to us that this difficulty might be eased to some extent if the Bahrein Government were prepared to help by building approach roads and possibly a hotel for night accommodation (I believe no hotel exists at Bahrein at the moment). However, it will no doubt be better to say nothing to the Bahrein Government for the present. Yours sincerely, Sd. E. P. DONALDSON. The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel W. R.

The meeting went on to consider the Survey Party's recommendation that an airfield should be built at Bahrein (Hamala) for long-term use by Tudors and aircraft of similar characteristics. It was noted that the R.A.F. had a continuing interest in Bahrein but their requirements were fully met by the existing airfield on Muharraq Island. (The Air Ministry proposed to maintain this latter airfield on something more than a care and maintenance basis and would keep a 24 hour radio watch). The political advantages of operating to an airfield in 'British influence' territory were stressed by the Foreign Office and India Office representatives and, from the point of view of our relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein, the use of Bahrein instead of Dhahran was welcomed by the India Office. It was even suggested that the Sheikh might be prepared to bear part of the cost, e.g. by providing labour, building approach roads or accommodation, etc. B.O.-k.C. had a commercial interest in stopping at Bahrein, but in view of the probable expansion of local services in the Persian Gulf it was evident that on civil aviation grounds the main justification for building an air field for heavy aircraft on Manama Island was on operational grounds. It was therefore agreed (5) That B.O.A.C. should be asked for a restatement , of their operational and commercial requirements at Bahrein, with special reference to their operational requirements for the Tudor and aircraft of similar characteristics (Action : Planning Division ). (6) That on the assumption that B.O.A.C. provided an operational case for use of Bahrein the Foreign Office and the India Office should be asked to state their views for the purpose of an approach to the Treasury (Action : Planning Division ). It was agreed (7) That the choice for the interim period iay between Shaibah and Dhahran and from the long term point of view between Bahrein and Dhahran: consideration need not be given to the other airfields covered in the Report.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Bahrain Political Agent, Captain Hugh Dunstan Lance, the Political Resident, Lieutenant-Colonel William Rupert Hay, Ludovic James Dunnett of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and Eion Pelly Donaldson of the India Office.The first part of the file (ff 3-19) contains correspondence relating to arrangements for the arrival of the survey party, including notices of estimated arrival, and the arrangement of taxis for transportation, made between 12 December 1946, when notification was received of the survey party visit (f 1) and the arrival of the party around 29 January 1947. The second part of the file (ff 20-49) is a copy of the report, entitled ‘Ministry of Civil Aviation Technical Survey Party, Report on Baghdad, Basra, Shaibah [Sha’iba], Dhahran, Abadan and Bahrain’, issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation Planning Secretariat and dated 27 February 1947. The report focusses on each aerodrome in turn, with sections and appendices on: runway orientation and size; suitability of runways for aircraft of certain size; passenger accommodation; engineering (drainage, subsoil, bearing strength); meteorological departments; air traffic control; and radio communications. At the front of the report (f 21) is a summary of conclusions and recommendations for the route between Palestine and India, chiefly concerning an extension of the runway at Shaibah and long-term planning for a new civil aviation airport at Bahrain. The last part of the file (ff 50-55) contains correspondence sent after the issue of the report, and a meeting, held in London on 1 April 1947, to assess the report’s recommendations. A letter from the Donaldson to Hay, dated 17 April 1947 (f 50), discusses the case for a new airport at Hamala, south of Manama, Bahrain, with a suggestion that the Bahrain Government might contribute to the scheme by investing in approach roads and a hotel.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Civil Aviation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Muharraq, British airbase</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Basra</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dhahran</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Basra Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baghdad Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abadan Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shaibah Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Airfields</topic></subject><subject><topic>Surveying</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00033f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
