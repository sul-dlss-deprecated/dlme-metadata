Dalrymple Be3^rave, Esq. ,c.B.K., Adviser to the Gcverhment of Bahrain.A SHi;lKH 0/ KUWAIT 6 His Highness Shaikh Sir Ah.'ned Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., is the grandson of tho famous Shaikh Mubarak as-Jubah and was born approximately in 1335. He succeeded, his uiicle Shaikh Salim as Shaikh of Kuwait on the U2rd of February 1921. Ke was appoint ed a Companion of the Star of India in and had the dignity of a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire conferred upon him in 2. Shaikh Ahmed, has succeeded during the vdiole of his reign in maintaining friendly relations with his powerful neighbour and his grandfather *s friend H.M. Abdul Azizlbn Saud. In fact when Shaikh Salim died Shaikh Ahmed was in Nejd using his best endea vours to restore good relations between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. His Highness 1 relations with his northern neighbour the Kingdom of Iraq were at one time not as satisfactory as could be desired largely owing to the unfortunate attitude taken up by various Iraqi governments with regard to His Highness* ancestral lands in the Basra Liwa but in recent years things have much improved and it is pleasant to recollect that the improvement is largely due to His Highness* forbearance. 3. During the present war it is gratifying to recall that both in public and in private His Higunoss has identified himself whole-heartedly with the Allied cause. This has not always been easy for especially in 1941 many people were misguided enough to imagine that Germany and her partner Italy would win the war. Kuwait owing to the example set by the Shaikh escaped the contami nation. which spread so rapidly through Iraq at the time of the Rashid Ali disturbances. Not only has His Highness displayed his devotion to His Majesty*s Government by setting an example to his people but he and his State have also made large contributions to the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund on two separate occasions and with these contri butions three lighter aircraft were purchased and were named **AL KUWAIT', 'WARAH', and 'KHADHAMA**. His Highness has on every occasion acquiesced In every | demand made upon him for assistance in the furtherance of the /Alliedbp' - fi; o *-« • Allied cause and placed his property and buildings at Shuwaik free of charge at the disposal of the Ministry of War Transport who carried out the construction there of over 400(?) barges for use on the Shatt-al-Arab. 4. His Highness has since early boyhood been a keen sportsnan and has taken every opportunity during the winter months to spend as many days as possible in the desert ’where he can combine the pleasures of hawking with the duty of getting into close touch with his bedouin subjects. Hawking is the traditional sport of northern Arabia and it is not too much to say that His Highness is second only to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz in his enthusiasm and love for this fascinating pastime. 5. Kuwait has been affected as every country by the present war and although through the mercy of God neither the tov/n nor the people have been subjected to close contact with our enemies by being air-raided or bombarded there are Kuwaitis who have lost their relations, friends, and property in the Far dast in parti cular in Singapore. Like all the States of the Persian Gulf it has been difficult to provide the people with adequate food but thanks be to God it has been done although unfortunately the traditional diet of the people, rice, has not been obtainable for the last year. High prices and scarcity of supply have made life difficult in particular for the bedouins bjit everything possible is being done to provide everyone with the means to exist with a reasonable amount of comfort. 6. Since the earliest days of what has really been a remarkably tranquil reign His Highness has shown a predilection for the Royal Navy and has always welcomed visits from Naval ships. His Highness has numerous photographs of Commander-in-chiefs of the Last India Squadron and officers of the Persian Gulf Division and is ever ready to discuss his friends, for such they are, when he hears of their further advancement. One of His Highness* first acts during the present war was to hand over as a free gift to the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf his largest and most powerful launch. 8-4-44.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000023_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1300</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000023</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1300</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 6/81 Investiture of Shaikhs'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1944/1944</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-08-31T18:06:58</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (24 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 26; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located at the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 3-22; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence relating to the investiture of the Shaikh of Kuwait (Shaikh Ahmed al Jabir as-Subah [Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ]).
