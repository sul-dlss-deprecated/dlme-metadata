His object was to go to Yemen via Assyr and he tried to get passage in a samhook going to Medi. His attempt was frustrated by the passive interference of the local Turkish authorities.

He speaks Arabic well and has been in Yemen and other parts of Arabia before also. He is an explorer of natural history.

Dear Mr. Stewart, A Mr. G. W. Bury has applied for an appointment under the F.O., either in Morocco or in some other Arabic -speaking country. He encloses a copy of a letter of recommendation (apparently unsigned), which he says was given him by Sir Richmond Ritchie. It is stated in this letter that Mr. Bury was Assistant Resident for a year at Aden in 1903, and has an intimate knowledge of Arabs and Arab manners. I should be grateful if youi+deau** w^ri. you could ascertain and let us know a few more details about him, such as his age, the sort of employment and the kind of salary he expects to obtain, As you know, the only posts we might be able to offer him are Vice Consular appointments at a small (£400 a year) salary.

On 16th.September 2908 he wrote that he coni mj luted a journey on behalf of the British Museum in South Arabia 'with the sanction of the Aden authorities' 1 , ana asked for a money contribution. The Governor of Bombay ana the Gov- eminent of India adhered to their former opinion, and on ?th.October 1908 Mr.Bury was informed by the Secretary of State that permission could not be granted, In^the Mo. of the Royal 8eogra]Picul Journal for Juny. 1908 appeared an announcement that Mr.Bury 'has undertaken* an (expedit ion to South Arabia under the ausyices of the Society.

In May 1109 the exjedit ion came to an end in consequence of the obstruct ion offered by the Sheikh of Maura.

Avoiding a long account of my grievances I enclose a brief statement of the latest developments which have reduced me to the verge of destitution. I am convinced that the India Office would reconsider its attitude if only the real facts could he placed before it in the proper light, for I have again md again undertaken service of a secret and hazardous nature on behalf of Government in S. Arabia, invariably without official sorption and liable to repudiation if involved in difficulties, even when actually carrying out orders and instructions. This situation I accepted naturally enough, but it seems to me unjust that Government should suddenly brand such action as defiant, and aim a secret order at me individually which involved my financial ruin and the greatest humiliation. I think if my past record of service is looked up it be found that I have always been ready to face risk or hardship in the interests of Government and deserved better treatment. I am sure that some misconception exists and it is in the hope of correcting it that I venture on this appeal for Your Lordship will I trust accept my apologies. I am, etc., (Signed) G. W.

My Lord, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated ::4th June 1910, and a copy of your telegram to the Government of India asking for a full report by this mail as to the reasons for not allowing ' r. Bury to reside in ‘den, 2. ''hi 1st commanding the Luc kno w Brigade in February 1910 and when under orders tor Aden, I received a visit loom . Bury, and he told me that he was anxious to visit Arabia and to travel through the Interior and asked for my permission to do so. I told him he should apply to the Resident at Aden. He replied that he was not on good terms with the Aden olit ica Is n t hoped that I would give him permission, I said I could not go into the duestion till I had taken over charge of the Residency and had consulted with the Political Officers as I kne ’ nothing of the place or its . noli tics, t also said that 1 would do what ^ could to help h .m. 3, On arrival at Aden I told General BeBrath, 'hom I was relieving, of Mr. Bury f s request and his intention of visiting Aden to see me on the subject. General ~e rath told me the history of the individual and gave orders that if Mr. Bury did arrive in Aden he was not to be allowed to land. On the arrival of the Bombay mail on f’^th April 1910 4.I received a letter Irom T !r. Bury saying he was on board the 0, S.S/’Salsette' and had been refused to land and asked for rav in- V tervention. I sent oraers to the -olice that he might land and found that he had already done so, as the P. &amp; 0. Agent took him ^ ashore against the protests of the 'olice* In any case the ?„ &amp; 0. steamer could not have been called on to allow one of their ships to be used as a place of detention so that my action in overruling General DeBrath’s orders was correct. T fr. Bury f s statement that on arrival he was made prisoner on the vessel by order of the First Assistant Besident is entirely wrong. I attach copies of the orders issued to the olice and to TT r. Bury. 5. I interviewed !tr. Bury the following morning and told him that very definite orders were received as regards him and that under no circumstances could I allow him to go into the Inte rior. TI e was considerably perturbed at this and ashed it he mi ght go down the coast to Hodeida or Shukra and slip across that way as the Chief of Behan would send nira an armed party for escort. I in formed him that my orders were ouite clear and that I could not connive in assisting him in any way to evade the orders. 6. Mr. Bury stayed here some days at one of the hotels and interviewed several natives; he was being watched by the 'olice and in due time I was informed that Mr. Bury had the intention of going aboard one of the dhows so as to reach one of the Arabian ports and thence make his way into the Interior. I then wrote to T ’r. -ury that ne had no reasons for remaining here, that I had no intention of allowing my orders from the Secretary of State to be evaded; and as there was no longer any reason for him to remain except with the intention of going into the Interior, I past ask him to leave Aden. Mr. Bury then left Aden for England on SOth April. Mr. Bury f s history is known to your Lordship and I was informed by an Arab friend that if Mr. Bury crossed the frontier, all further trouble would be avoide d as the Tribes meant to shoot him. 8« My action in the case was due to a desire to carry out the43 s the Secretary of State's orders Quoted in the margin, ''r.

COPY OF TELEGRAM. From Dated Received at London Office (Pill) IcSvq2 &lt;7?? l y Savile Row, Burlington Gardens, London, W’. February 11th, 1909. The Under Secretary of State, India Office, S.W. /X Jo( Sir, With reference to your letter of the 4th. inst. concerning Mr Bury*s journey in South Arabia, I am to inform you that a letter has been sent to that gentleman animadverting on the fact of his having withheld most important information from the Society, and saying that in view of the effect which the warning sent b}'- the Government of India may have on the local chiefs, the Council think that he should seriously consider the advisability of giving up his journey. It should however be noted that this letter will pro bably be too late to catch Mr Bury, whose exact whereabouts is not known; and also that the Society has no power whatever to prevent him landing in Arabia. I am also to add that it is for the Secretary of State for India to consider the possible effect on the minds ofjS&gt; y 'P 1, Savilc Row, Burlington Gardens, London, V/. 2 . ''Vorant local chieftains of warning them that the British Government disapprove of Mr Bury*s tour, and whether, if he has succeeded in starting, his life, and the life of his companion, may not thus he endangered, especially considering hew rapidly rumours pass in such countries, and how subject they are to gross exaggeration. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your obedient Servant, President, R.G.S. U ' c .. ! V f- D 10 a.ra. 12 FEB. 1303 IN DIA O rFlCS^Hi Sir Arthur Sodley, G.G.B., India Office, S.W. Sir, In reply to your letter of January 14, with reference to the expedition under Mr Gr. W. Bury, to South-eastern Arabia, I think the most satisfactory reply would he to submit for the consideration of Lord Morley, the following statement of facts: Mr Bury communicated with the Society about a year ago, offering to undertake to explore as far as possible, the unknown portion of South-eastern Arabia, if the Society would lend him support. As the Society did not know anything about Mr Bury, enquiries were made concerning his competency and his trustworthy- nesa from Sir O’Moore Creagh, and General P. J» Maitland, former Residentsof Aden under whom Mr Bury served, and also Colonel Wahab who made use of his services during the delimitation of tne Aden frontier. Their replies were thoroughly satisfactory. We understand that Mr Bury did communicate with the India Office, and that the India Office objected to his entering Arabia through Muskat. At the same time, Mr Bury communicated with General Be Brath, the Political Resident at Aden, and on June 28, 1908, General Be Brath wrote to Mr Bury, stating that he should not objecu to his landing at any Southern Arabian port, east of Hogra, so long as he avoided Padthili, Amier and Abdale territory. As thxs authorization seemed to the Council satisfactory, and as MrBury promised he would comply with the conditions, and enter Arabia at a post considerably to the East of Aden and outside British territory, they thought tnat tney were justified in making Mr Bury the grant of £300 which he asked for. £300 has actually been paid to Mr Bury, who is accompanied by a young Englishman who has also contributed £300 towards the expedition. They left England about a month ago, and are now probably preparing to land at a South Arabian port to the East of Aden. It is possible that Lord Morley is under the impression that Mr Bury was to land in British territory, and pass through British territory, and that if he realized that Mr Bury has no such intention, but means to enter entirely outside of British territory and pass through the unknown portion of South East Araoia his objection to the expedition might be removed. The region in question is one of the greatest unknown stretches in Asia, and it has long been the desire of the Society to have it explored. Bury seemed in many ways exceptionally fitted for the task, and the Council wo\;ld naturally regret, if for any reason, the expedition would not be allowed to proceed. The position therefore, is as follows. A grant of I have the honour to be, Sir Your obedient Servant, President, R.G-.S.mm 2 t((&gt; A . \x 1, Savilc Row, Burlington Gardens, London, January 18, 1909. Slr-Afthur Godley, G.C.B., India Office, S.W. Sir, I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 14, with refer ence to Mr 0. W. Bury’s expedition into Southern Arabia, which will receive careful and immediate attention. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Secretary R.G.Slli f [^)ubZe.cJr- j^1^’^‘j e ' &lt; j ASIA. Mr. G. W. Bury’s Proposed Expedition in South Arabia.—Mr. G. W. Bury, who has had much experience of travel in South-West Arabia, has just undertaken a more extensive expedition than any that he has yet carried out, in the hope of eventually making his way into the unknown interior. He proposes to land somewhere east of Aden, and proceed via the Yeshbum valley and Nisab to Behan al Jezab, and thence to Harib and March, examining en route some of the ruined or buried cities (such as Shabwa, north of Nisab), and possibly waiting at one or other of the places mentioned for a favourable season for a further advance. From March, where he will try to obtain copies of the inscriptions to he found there, Mr. Bury hopes to move northward along, or in touch with, the caravan route to Riadb, if such a route still exists and water is procurable, making occasional journeys eastward into the desert. If it should he possible to reach Aflaj via Wadi Dawasir, he will endeavour to traverse the Yabrin district, keeping on northwards towards Hautha—a route which should enable him to strike the supposed Oman-Mecca pilgrim route, if it has any real existence. If successful in this, and the route seemed practicable, he would make for Muskat. Otherwise he would choose one of various courses which would lead him either north to the Persian gulf, west (from Eiadh) to the Red sea, or south to the Hadramautr. Mr. Bury’s acquaintance with Southern Arabia dates from 1896, between which year and 1903 he was engaged in various expeditions of antiquarian or zoological research, including the Austrian expedition of the Yienna Academy of Sciences. Besides speaking Arabic, he has acquired a knowledge of some of the local Q’Mec s, having lived on intimate terms with the desert clans. His new expedition (tor ttie purposes of which he has had some instruction in surveying at the Society) is supported by a grant from the Council, and he will be accompanied by Mr. P. H. L*. Gethin, who has taken the Society’s diploma, and is contributing to the expenses of the expedition.

Trey have, moreover, taken the advice o/| certain authorities, who are familiar with the conditions, Tkey ^ 710 d ™bt at all about your qualifications for undertaking the work that you propose, but view of the relations of the Society to the I Departments here as well as in India, the Council feel that they could not do anything until you got the permission of the authorities at Aden, Moreover, I learn, from an Indian Survey Officer, that tb the present moment the Political Dept. (I believe it is) in India, has under preparation a complete map of Arabia for which they are tlmy-mre' anxious to get every information on the country that is available, and I am informed that there will be every hkhnood of their being willing to employ you to go into the country, and get all the information possible, | concerning the less known parts of Arabia for the purposes of this map. The Officer I refer to , is communicating with the Political Department on the subject, and I think it desirable therefore to postpone taking any steps until we hear from India.

G- C- M- G- G- C- Q- E. BSMBSY. MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP. That I the under-signed G. W. Bury, late Extra Asst. Resident at Aden, being greatly aggrieved at the order of the Bombay Government, dated 7th October 1904, No. 613a, dismissing me from Government service, and purporting to have been passed at the instamTof Major-General Mason, Political Resident at Aden, wha in his reports to Government made certain allegations against me, beg most respectfully to lay the following petition before your Lordship for a reconsideration of my case and of the issues involved in it; and I feel perfectly convinced that when the grounds of my innocence are completely established as I hope to do in this petition by arguments of the most irrefutable nature,, your LorSship will accord me that measure of justice which I have hitherto failed to receive. It may be mentioned with gratitude that although Government has refrained carefully from expressing any belief in the truth of the imputations levelled against me or in the correctness of the conclusions arrived at by General Mason as embodied in his letters, yet as the action of Government was' based on the reports made by the Resident at Aden, the letters and the papers, underlying them must necessarily form the main subject of your petitioners present appeal. The order of Government No, 61 S3 was communicated to me towards the end of October 1904. The condit on of my health compelled me to go to England and when I returned and asked for copies of the papers of my case, I received them only at Berbera in the beginning of August. In the absence of any local facilities, this petition had to be drafted and sent to India to be printed. This accounts for the unavoidable delay that has occurred in the presentation of this petition. Copies of the papers of the- case given to me are annexed herewith marked. My dismissal from the public service has a far more serious andm wider effect than was perhaps contemplated by Government when their order No. 6133 was passed. My whole career as a naturalist and Explorer was centred in Arabia where I was employed by the British Museum and the Imperial Academy of Austria at Vienna. My accusers have not only deprived me of a Government post of some position and influence which it is true was only temporary, but have so stigmatized my name in Arabia as to render it practically useless for me to pursue further the ca^r that I had built up for myself by so many years of study and hard work and to attain proficiency in which I had made so many sacrifices not only of money, but also of my health and at times at risk even of my life. By the action of my accusers my further prospects in the direction I have aimed at for some years are now hopeless, for as far as the public know I have been dismissed from Government service as a result of the disgraceful charges that have been brought against mo, and any career in Arabia is consequently closed to me. My connections with Arabia are peculiar. Before being employed by Government, Your Lordship’s petitioner was in the employ of the British Museum and the Imperial Academy of Austria at Vienna on various mis sions in the Interior of Arabia, and had acquired in consequence such a knowledge of the Country, language and habits and customs of the people as rarely falls to the lot of an Englishman. I was adopted by an Arab Tribe and went by the name of Abdulla Mansur, Mansur being the name of my adoptive father. I fully adopted the role of an Arab. Among my numerous Arab acquaintances was His Highness the Sultan of Lahej, who is the most important and influential Chief in the vicinity of Aden, and who has, as the papers show, taken an active part in the case against me. On the Aden Boundary Commission leaving Aden in January 1902, I was employed as Naturalist to the Commission till I was selected for the post of Extra Assistant Resident from 1st April 1903 for a term which was subsequently extended to the date of my suspension. Prior to this and during many expeditions into Arabia I had the honour to be of service to the Resident and one such service was acknowledged by Government with a grant of Rs. 1000. Hurit^g my service under Government 1 have had ample and better opportunities of appropriating money, had I but wished to, than at the time I was charged with doing so, but I have preserved my name above the breath of suspicion; to prove which I cannot call upon a more sincere and eloquent testimony than that of Colonel Abud (vide his letter marked ( J ), who had known me, and my accusers and general people of Arabia for a number of years, and who pointed out the records in which would be found corroboration of his views.But all these things were lost upon my judges and Colonel Abud’s letter and the Government instructions for a stricter inquiry were practically ignored or considered superfluous, when by a hasty, ill-judged and inequitous inquiry to which no parallel can bo found X was adjudged guilty of receiving illegal gratifications and my name and prospects blasted for ever, on evidence, which was, on the very face of it, tainted, improbable, confiioting and absurd. It pains me to speak in these terms of officers about whom otherwise I enter tain the highest respect, but any body placed in my position, who though innocent is completely misjudged and misrepresented, could hardly say less. The grounds of this petition are the following:—• «. * v - ' ' £ v : A 0 cl O'. A _ &gt;. ( 1 ). Tag inquiry, if it be so called, is characterised throughout by illegality, informality and by a haste unjustifiable when looking to the seriousness of the charges and the position of the ac cused, and is therefore null and void. ( 2 ). The evidence for the prosecution is conflicting, inadequate, un reliable, tainted on the very face of it, and fails signally to establish any indentity between the ostensible receiver of the gift of 250 sovereigns, and the loan of 240 Rupees, alleged to be given to one Abdu Umar on the 21st and 24th March, and myself, who is known by the Arab name of Abdulla Mansur, as also between the sums received as a loan and gift and the sum of 300 sovereigns deposited by me in the National Bank, Aden, on 22nd April 1004.. ( 3 ). Due weight is not given to my statements elicited from me on honour, and which as the reports to Government show were not properly dealt with nor was the right construction placed upon them. This fact combined with the fact that no suitable opportunity was ever given to me to cite witnesses or to test the accuracy of accounts or to question in any way the statements of the Sultan of Lahej and his sou, amount to a practical denial of justice. ( 4 ). The. conclusions arrived at by General Mason as set out in . his reports to Government are erroneous, and are not sustainable on any recognised principles of justice and equity. ( 5 ). The whole enquiry shows that the case against me was pre judiced throughout, and no effort was ever made to ascertain the motives of my accusers, though sufficiently apparent directly the Saltan of Lahej and his son appeared on the scenic, and the character and position of my accusers, and myself respee-fcively, were not duly weighed though the result of the enquiry mic/ht entail such momentous consequences to myself. to I now proceed to discuss these grounds seriatim. GROUND I The enquiry is divided into two parts, and occupied on the whole four days viz. 24th and 25th August and 23rd and 24th September. No diary is kept of the proceedings and no notes appear to have been taken at the time of the recording of the various statements as regards the conduct and appearance of the various parties concerned in this case. The inquiry for the most part is conducted by Colonel Davies, as General Mason says in his report ( A ) and Colonel Davies was one of the complainants, vide Report K 2 , No. 174 of 1904, the General clearly says that “ Colonel Davies brought the matter to my notice/' “who was directed to inquire into the matter.” General Mason speaks of his impressions only in the second report. Conse quently we shall have to eliminate some important expressions made use of by him as not substantiated by the papers furnished to me. Also it may be stated appropriately here that this is no ordinary case of receiving illegal gratification as defined in the Law Codes.— but as the facts show this is a case of a spontaneous gifc for services rendered in the past, althrough when the recipient of the gift first had need of money, as is alleged, he was given a loan of Rs. 240 only distinctly on promise of repayment. What reason had Abdu Umar in whose name these transactions stand to ask for a loan when a gift of at least £ 200 was contemplated as is shown by Balaxa obtaining this sum from Deoji on the very day after the alleged loan was made. Was it even probable that a loan would be asked for and granted when the evidence shows that a gift of a large sum was then in contemplaaation and, in order to fulfil this intention, the gold deemed necessary was obtained the very next day (Deoji's evidence). What sudden outburst of gratitude induced my accusers to obtain the £ 200 to be used as a gift on the day following the grant of the loan of Rs. 240 Another question also arises as to why the loan should have been con cealed by a pseudonym and not entered directly in my name, when it was a loan and involved nothing criminal. These were preliminary question strikin^ at the root of the allegations that should strike any judicial in quirer and consequently required greater exertions to arrive at right conclu- ’ons, and are here emphasized only to show the amazingly short period of time taken up in disposing of these questions which from a cursory point of view demanded careful and minute handling lasting for a number of days, and more especially in the case of Balaxa’s account books; especially when5 the reputation and prospects of a Government servant of the present peti- tioner’s position were at stake. First rumours, persistent as they are termed come to the ears of General Mason and Colonel Davies but the names of the informers are not divulged. The statements of the accusers show that there was nobody besides 'the parties implicated who was conversant with the affair. It may be skfely assumed therefore that the informers, if any, were none else but the accusers themselves or other persons set in motion by these accusers. My accusers have admitted that by the entry of a name other than mine in the accounts and by other precautions taken they intended to render any transaction between them and me as obscure as possible. Who then but my accusers themselves could have spread the rumours which were said to exist and how does this circumstance tally with their reluctance to give evidence on which the Resi dent has founded his. conviction of my guilt in so large a measure. These- rumours were to the effect that I, if not actually a partner in the camel Transport Contract granted to Saleh Mahomed Balaxa, received large sums of money from the contractors, hut there was no, rumour about any transaction of a like na&amp;e with Abdulla Umar Orige. E^wever as the record says Saleh Balaxa and Bubakar and Orige were heard in. my absence but their statements, were not recorded, nor does it appear that they were put on oath on the 23rd August. They were called next day and then, their- statements were- recorded: on. oath and entries of the loan and gift shown but in my absence as is admitted by General Mason in his report ( A ). This initial informality and illegality is not explained. There was no reason why they should not have been confronted with me before their statements were put dowa The only object to be served, by this extraordinary and unusual pro cedure was to permit my accusers to make any statement they pleased in my absence without fear, and this was again repeated at the second stage of the enquiry; But whatever motive influenced this course it undoubtedly acted to my prejudice and in any ordinary court of law would, have tended to cause the whole proceeding to, be quashed on appeal Then^Umaram Orige arrives on the scene, though his connection with me never formed the subject of rumours as the report of the Resident states. His statement was also recorded in my absence. I was then asked, my explanations. AH this took place on the 24th August. Next day the broker Deoji comes up, and is examined, though Balaxa in his examination the day before professes doubt as to whether he had obtained gold from him: or from another shroff The entries in Deojfs books were shown, and, a report drawn up and forwarded to Government. The second stage of the inquiry is still more cursory- and informal andleads me to believe that my conviction was a foregone conclusion. Govern- ment telegram of 20 th September distinctly enjoins the Resident to take in to careful consideration Colouel Abud’s letter ( J. ) and to test the genuin- ness of the entries in the Arab’s books and to hold personal examination of myself and the Arab witness. How these injunctions were acted upon £pp 0 aj*g iii the record. Saleh Balaxa s second statement is taken down in my absence for the confirmation of the charges because it has oozed out that there was a third party in the contract and a sum as considerable as £&gt; 25Q could not have been given without his consent and his consent if not proved would be fatal to the whole inquiry. The defect is sought to be remedied by sending a letter to the Sultan of Lahej and obtaining his reply together the confirmatory signature to Balaxa’s statement at the hands of Sultan Alibin Ahmed. It may be protested that this was no evidence, and inquiries are never conducted in this way. The Sultan of Lahej and his son were, never put on oath or confronted with me or subjected to cross-examination. It may be suggested by way of answer to my query on this point that this was only an inquiry and strict compliance with legal forms was not required but equity demanded something more than these informal and inconclusive proceedings in order to convict me. Then my explanation of the coincidence of 300 sovereigns paid into the National Bank at Aden is recorded, and my defence asked for and practi cally refused. The first part of the inquiry will show your Lordship that my defence was never then asked for. We shall have to speak at some length on this point later on. I merely allude to the subject here by way of showing the undue zeal and illegality and total disregard of the natural laws of justice with which the proceedings were conducted, where no defence was ever asked for. Again no books of account were sent for and examined in this second inquiry as the record shows and in the first part of the inquiry merely the entries of the alleged loan and gift were pointed out. From all this it is apparent that the whole inquiry has no practical value whatsoever, and no valid inference of the guilt of any person could be properly deduced from it. GROUND II. The evidence of the prosecution consists of:— ( 1 ). Statement of Saleh Mahomed Balaxa recorded on 24th August and the production of his expenditure books on that day in which the items of Rs. 240 alleged as a loan and 250 sovere igns alleged as a gift to one Abdu Umar were shown to the court bearing dates 20 th March and 24th March, respectively..7 ( 2 ). Statement of his partner Bubakar Okaba on the 24th August in confirmation of the gift of 250 sovereigns. ( 3 ). Statement of broker Deoji, 25th August and the production of his cash-book. ( 4 ). Statement of Abdulla Umar Orige as to the amount of £ 100 paid to me in June and Ostrich feathers given along with the sum in consideration of his son’s recall. ( 5 )* Second statement of Saleh Mahomed Balaxa alleging the cog nisance of Sultan Ali bin Ahmed about the gift of 250 sove reigns, to which statement a signature of Sultan Ali was procured in the absence of the accused. Sultan Ali or his father the Sultan of Lahej not appearing before the Resident. About the informality and illegality of ( 1 ) ( , ( 2 .) , &amp; ( 5 ) we have spoken at length, now it remains to examine carefully their intrinsic worth. It may be observed here that Bubakar Okaba says nothing of the alleged loan of Rupees 240, though he is a partner in the concern and that no confirmation by way of cognisance of the affair of the loan, and of the forage worth Rs. 597 is. sought from Sultan Ali bin Ahmed or his father. Foracre : o worth, Rs.. 597 and; a loan of Rs. 240 could not have been paid from the partnership assets without the consent of the other partners. The statements and, the entries shown by Balaxa are in contrast with his other statemeat of 23rd September as well as with the statement of Okaba. Also no entries substantiating the dealings with, Deoji on March 21st and. March 22nd are shown in the expenditure-account-books produced for inspection by Balaxa and the Resident has never inquired into this point, or if he did, has found no corroboration of the items shown by Deoji. Two hundred: sovereigns on the 2.1st March and one hundred sovereigns on the next day could not have been obtained without showing corresponding items of silver in the account-books of Saleh Balaxa, for he himself says he paid fdr these sovereigns in rupees. Now in his re-examination on the 24th August . . . Balaxn states that he received the £ 250 from either Ratna Champsi or Deoji. At this time his account-books were with him as he had shown entries in them only shortly before he made this reply and yet he was un able to say positively from whom he had received the sovereigns, and yet if Balaxa’s books were kept in a proper and business like manner they could not have failed to contain the name of the shroff from whom he had obtain ed the gold. It can only be presumed that the books did not contain, this information, otherwise Balaxa could not have been uncertain from whom he had received the gold; and yet in face of this glaring proof of the insuffici-8 ency of Balaxa’s books which apparently do not contain the name of a person, with whom a transaction involving such a sum of £ 250 has taken place the Resident has, in his reports to Government, expressed his full belief and that he is satisfied that these books are the genuine books of the firm. If this is the method of business adopted by Balaxa, it is not to be wondered at that only some two months or less prior to this transaction he appears before the Collector of income-tax and obtained a remission of his assessment on the ground of his failure to make his business pay. The Resident was warned that such was the case and yet the mere entry in the name of one Abdu Umar is held to be proof of my guilt. I would further add that the questions put in the re-examination of this Balaxa were unfair to me, as they had no connection with anything stated by him in the exa mination -in-chief, and I had no opportunity of cross-examination on them, as is shown by the record. This is a vital point but the record as it stands is silent on the matter. Also if ^00 sovereigns were obtained on the 21 st March, the loan bu siness on the 20 th March sounds improbable. When the accused and the accusers were aware that £ 200 for the purposes of a gift were to be ob tained the next day, no one would be so hasty as to ask for a loan of Rs. 240 on the 20th, with a promise to repay. The falsity of this charge of a loan of Rs. 240 to me is proved by the fact that £ 200 was obtained on the 21 st March for payment to me as a gift and the second part of the inquiry shows that Sultan Ali bin Ahmed was- not only aware that the gift was to be made but had consented to it. This must have been known to Balaxa at least on the 20 th March, for he procures gold on the 21 st March, and also on the 22 nd idem, yet at my request a loan of the comparatively small sum of Rs. 240 is made to meat this very tune and that on condition of repayment, nor is any reason given for my asking for it. How can these two stories be consistently reconciled with each other? The only conclusion that an unbiassed mind could possibly draw from them is that both were untrue and had been concocted with the deliberate object of ruining me. That Balaxa was a born intriguer and liar could not have been better ‘ UStrated thaD by h!s P 08itiv9 assertion of Rupees 597 as the value of the forage supplied to me. He says that accounts are kept- of the forage but e orage supplied to mo was not inserted for the monthly total was small, o forage alleged to be supplied was from March to Juno and according o Okaba from February to May, i. e; for four months, the monthly average ota eing 150 Rupees, which is less than the loan of Rs. 240 , but.in the9 aggiegate of Rs. 597 IS considerably more than double the amount of the can. Without keepmg accounts of the forage supplied how could he hare arrived at the positive sum of Rs. 597. This point has not struck the ■Resident, for no suspicion ever seems to have entered his mind about Balava’s statements which were taken as those of an honest man, though Balasa ; th8 SuIta ' ° f Lah ^ his Sultan Ah bin Ahmed, one and all stand convicted by their own statements and letters on the record as accomplices whose uncof berated evidence should have carried no weight The entries shown by Ba^a in the expenditure-account-books of the Camel Transport Contract which is a large concern, are contained in one and the same page ( see his statement B) and embrace transactions for a period of 5 days namely from the 20 th to 24th March 1904 as he himself states and indeed may include other items for all I know. It does not ap pear which of these items was placed first. The books do not appear to have been inspected as regards the daily cash balances- the cash-book 'of the him checked daily must be a different one from the expenditure-books which concern themselves only with the ordinary expenditure in connection with the conduct of the contract. It might very properly be surmised that the expenditure-books were liable to go into the hands of all concerned in the contract, and might also- at any time require to be produced in a public court should any necessity arise, and in this event the detection of the items of the loan and the gift to Abdu Umar was at any time possible and liable to bring the whole concern into trouble. My accusers had ia view the con- cealmeat of these transactions with me, as they themselves state, and as astute men of business would never enter such items in books that at any moment might have to be produced and liable to be called in question in a public court and if the books produced before the Resident in this enquiry contain the entry of these transactions, the fact should havei caused some suspicion that the books had been prepared in order to support the charges and that they were not the reat and genuine books of the partnership. Yet as fas as I know nothing was done to carry out the instructions of Govern ment regarding these books, and if anything was done in this, direction it was done behind my back, unless the Resident or Colonel Davies claim to be experts in native accounts and that any opinion formed by them alone was entitled to carry any weight. I would further remark that General Mason is ignorant of Arabic in which language the books were kept and he consequently must have made his examination of the books by means of some one else and this behind my back. Who this person was is unknown and he is not even examined in the case, nor is this circumstance alluded to in the Resident's report, and yeton his ipse dixit alone the Resident is content to found his report as to the genuineness of the books. I only mention this fact as showing that the Resi dent could not have ascertained his belief from his own examination, but must have relied on another person who was probably at hand as the books were only before the Resident for part of the 24th August, as is shown by the Resident’s own reports to Government. No copies of the entries are put on the record nor furnished to me, consequently I am unable to discuss the point at any length but I may simply state that the accounts produced in this case were never subjected to the inspection of an expert on behalf of the Court, but they were taken as true from the first. It appears from Deoji’s evidence that 300 sovereigns were obtained on two different dates. It is also evident that the sum was not given to Abdu Umar on those dates. Why sovereigns two-hundred were obtained and one- hundred afterwards and why the gift was not given on the day of the purchase of gold is inexplicable. Why fifty sovereigns were obtained in excess of the gift and how they were disposed of, remains a mystery, inspite of the accounts produced, and which are alleged to be carefully inspected. Could not the gift have been given in rupees or was the alleged Abdu Umar desirous of creating the evidence of the broker against himself; If Abdu Umar be myself what necessity had I, whilst^Government employ, to receive his gift in the shape of gold, on March 24th, or to pay almost the identical sum in gold into the Bank within a month of its alleged receipt, thereby manufacturing evidence against myself. These are questions that have never been raised or solved. The loan is alleged to be given at the house of Balaxa with whom 1 am supposed to have fraternized as is related by Okaba, could not the gift have been given with equal privacy ? Would I be so disingenuous as to re ceive the gift at my own door in open day-light publicly, Okaba witnessing the transaction. Balaxa and Okaba who are so particular in other respects can not state how I was dressed or whether I had shoes on or not. This tells heavily against the bona Tides of their allegations. To complete the plan and to inf/uence the decision of the judges, Abdulla Umar Orige is introduced with his complaint about 100 sovereigns, and the same broker evidently not of established repute, is cited; and to add to the verisimilitude of this charge the gift of some ostrich feathers is also introduced and the date on which I received the feathers put back from the 9 th August (the real date ) to some time in June and this with the object of being able to point out that he had paid me the £ 100 to obtain the recall of his son.11 which recall was actually decided on' early in July. Abdulla Umar Orige mentions the name of Sultan Ahmed Fadthl as being in Aden at the time of his gift. The date of this visit of the Sultan to Aden is not proved, and the time the gift is alleged to have been made therefore rests entirely on the unsupported allegation of Orige alone. Abdulla Umar Origa mentions the name of his servant Bubakar who was examined, but his evidence being contradictory to that of his master, if recorded, has not been furnished to me. Though Abdulla Umar Orige's charge is disproved yet there is no doubt that he served the purposes of my accusers by influencing the judgment of Colonel Davies and the Resident. Finding that they had concocted evidence for 250 sovereigns whilst I had paid 300 sovereigns into the Bank, Abdulla Umar Orige was called to make up for the remaining 50 sovereigns, but the dates differing his allegations were not pushed forward and his complaint was dismissed only with the remark that as he kept no accounts 'end had no witnesses his allegation was therefore impossible of proof. From the record moreover it would appear thnt Um Orige's statement was taken in my absence and that it was never put to the test of cross examination, nor was the date of his alleged gift of 100 sovereigns to me in any way established. Um Orige does not any where in his statement mention the name of the broker from whom he obtained the 100 sovereigns, nor does it appear from the record how any information on this point was obtained, yet when Deoji appears in Court on the 25th August apparently at the- behest of Balaxa who was not sure; on the day previous that he had obtained his gold from him, it is found, and how it was so discovered no explanation is forth-eommg, that, he also had supplied Um Orige with the gold alleged to have been paid to me. This ostensibly voluntary appearance of Deoji to substantiate Um Orige, connected with other seemingly fortuitous events in this case point with almost a certainty to a conspiracy having been formed against me. The object of commenting on Um Orige’s charge is to show that his allegations were necessary to those who framed this conspiracy against me, and that it was brought forward in the endeavour to prejudice me by making it appear that I habitually accepted illegal gra tifications and in this way to slur over the weak places in Balaxa’s charge, and as further evidence to show that the Abdu Umar mentioned in both charges was identical with myself. It was necessary to show that taking bribes was habitual with me, for it could not seriously be supposed that Um Orige’s charge could be proved in the absence of his books, for he kept none, and substantiated as it was only by his own servant. I may remark that in a Court of Justice Um Origa’s charge would have been stigmatized as reckless and its effect on mycase 12 would have been nil, instead of which the Resident's report would lead any one to believe that he considered the charge to be true and that it was merely an accident that proof was difficult and at last impossible. Not withstanding this, its effect on the Kesident's mind is evident as furnishing a missing link in the whole chain of evidence connecting me with the alle gations of Saleh Balaxa. To speak plainly these men are condemned out of their own mouths as criminals and accomplices who are amenable to the law in the absence of any indemnity. The item of Rs. 240 was invented merely to establish the inference that Abdu Umar had no money of his own In his possession and to identify 300 sovereigns in the Bank with the amount of £ 250 of the gift of Saleh Balaxa. But Um Orige’s allegations are posterior to my banking the £ 300 and no identity is established between the two sums of 300 and 250 so vereigns respectively. For identity the remaining 50 sovereigns should have been obtained in Aden for an equivalent in silver, and that could not have been done without leaving some trace behind. For this purpose it was better to call upon the National Bank to produce my accounts, which was never done, and everything was taken for granted as alleged. The identity of the gift failing there is no evidence to connect me with Abdu Umar, the ostensible recipient of the gift in the books of Balaxa except their own statements, which are tainted and can never be received as independent evidence because of their position as accomplices. GROUND III. From the papers of the first part of the inquiry ending in the report of the Resident to Government dated 28th August 1904, it will appear to Your Lordship that I was never called upon to produce my evidence and witnesses; the record is clear on the point. All I was asked was to give my own explanation of the charges and though the record is silent on the point I was put on my honour in my replies. These statements of mine are taken to be or understood to be admissions of the various charges and are to a greater or less extent so dealt with in his reports to Government by the Resident. But a little attention to them as they stand in the record will show that they do not bear that construction. When put on honour, I stated what was the truth. I had not the least suspicion that any adva ntage would be taken of my frankness and strict adherence to truth. I di savowed any connection with money-gifts or the loan of Rs. 240. I merely admitted the present of some feathers from Um Orige, and it was only when Um Orige fell on his knees before me and said that I should break his respect if I refused his gift that I reluctantly consented to accept thef at hoi a knowing as 1 do that refusal to accept a gift under the circumstances regarded as an insult in Arabia, and it must here be remembered that I had been adopted into an Arab tribe and was therefore bound by Arab customs more than any one else would have been in a similar position. As for forage from Balaxa, I did admit that I had received some and stated that though pressed for by me the bills were not sent to me. It can not follow from this that my statement amounted to an admission that I received the forage without money as is stated by the Resident. If this circumstance amounted to an offence any Government servant who allowed a shop-bill to run for a time might on these grounds be held guilty of a criminal offence. It is, I submit, the intention that is the offence and not the mere act of owing a bill. It may be observed here that I might have denied all or made any explanation about the charges as an accused with impunity for there could have been no evidence to substantiate these charges of forage and ostrich feathers, and I might have rested my case on the strength or otherwise of the prosecution but when compelled on honour to explain, I did so. I would draw Your Lordship’s attention to the fact that my admission of the receipt of the ostrich feathers and that I owed a bill for forage which were elicited from me by putting me on my honour have been held to be true, while anything which told in my favour under the same circumstances namely my denial of the acceptance of monetary gratifications has been held to be false and my whole explanation of how I came to be in possession of such a sum as £ 3,00 has been held to be only confirmatory of my guilt. It seems to me that it is extraordinary and illogical for an enquiring officer to believe only what told against me, while disbelieving what told in my favour. I was put on my honour and either the whole of my explanation should have been believed or the whole disbelieved. I may further remark that I never admitted having received the- forage without the intention of paying for itj as a matter of fact, and it is so recorded in the papers, I asserted that I had 1 on more than one occasion endeavoured to. obtain the bills for the forage; obviously with the intention of discharging them, by payment,, yet the Resident in his report has passed' over this point of my statement and has hastily and erroneSosIy concluded that I never had any intention to pay for these supplies. The second part of the enquiry was intended to give'me every chances of making a defence as the instructions of Government show, but here also I was doomed to be disappointed. As the: record shows I was present only on the occasion of my explanation as to the coincidence of the banking of14 the 300 sovereigns and after that explanation was recorded I was asked to state any thing further if I wished. I accordingly prayed that my witnesses should be examined, which prayer was refused on the ground that I had every oppotunity of calling any witness I wished at the previous examina tion This practically amounted to a refusal to hear and record my de fence though no opportunity was ever granted to me to make a defence at the first hearing. At the previous inquiry which lasted for two days only, I was never called on to enter a defence as the record will bear out, and when I gave my explanations on honour, I was under the impression that it would be believed and without being asked, X thought it would be out of place to cite my witnesses without being called on to do so. The Resident said that he was prepared to hear any witnesses if called at 2-30 p. m. was it ever possible that in so serious a case as this, I should be able to sum mon my witnesses in an hour? With such serious results to me in the balance, justice would seem to have required the exercise of the most scrupulous fair ness so as to give every chance to the defence in a case where charges were easy to be made and supported by a certain kind of evidence, and the refutation of which is always difficult. Here it may be conceded that under the circumstances disclosed by the case, my position of defence wepe neces sarily jeopardized by the exceptionally advantageous conditions under which the charges were advanced against me and proceeded with, and the attitude of my judges was any thing but favourable to me, of which I shall have to speak at length hereafter. But from what has been discussed in this ground Your Lordship will hardly put it down to exaggeration and embit tered feelings, when I state here emphatically that the trial as a whole as far as my defence was concerned amounted to a practical denial of justice. GROUND IV. From what has been argued above it will appear to Your Lordship that the evidence for the prosecution is on the face of it unreliable and tainted, and that the whole enquiry especially the second part of it has no judicial value, and even taken as an enquiry is insufficient to convict any one or even to suggest a suspicion regarding his conduct, and therefore, the conclusions arrived at by the Resident in his reports to Government are erroneous, and are of no practical value even as opinions. The second report is merely an adherence to the opinion expressed in the first one, and with the exception of the recording of my explanation as to my possession of &amp; 300 and the conviction expressed of Balaxa in my absence and without the test of cross-examination that Sultan Ali bin Ahmed would confirm his statement as to the gift of X 250 to me, there was ob- solutely nothing fresh on record with the exception of the letters to and15 from the Sultan of Lahej- The Resident omitted to conform to the orders of Government in matters which, had they been carried .out, would have placed my accusers in a very equivocal position and the Resident was app. arently determined to adhere to his first impressions even going so far as to imply that even if I did produce witnesses their statements would not afiect his ultimate report. I think it is evident that the Resident has in tensified any point that might tell against me, while omitting any notice of those that told in my favour, and has accepted as true the statements of my accusers who out of their own mouths are branded as accomplices in the alleged offences and as such their statements should have been received with the greatest caution and not with the implicit reliance which has been placed on them, and which is particularly emphasized by the Resident in his report. I have commented on the attitude of the authorities in Aden towards me in this matter which I can not but characterize as unfair in the extreme and the further instance I will now mention seems to point rather to a determination to use to my disadvantage anything that might crop up than to bring to light the real truth of the matter. In Colonel Abud's letter ( J ) he states when commenting on Sheikh Saleh Balaxa, “ but it seems almost incredible that he could have afforded to give the large sums he i&amp; alleged to have done to Mr.. Bury especially as the Sultan of Lahej, ivas practically, the real contractor, ” This letter was received by the Resident about the 21 st September 1904. The opening part of para 6 of the Resident's report to Government, shows the use that was made of this information. The Resident says ‘’ 6 . I have had reason to believe that the Sultan of Lahej was in some way connected with the contract With this information in his possession there was nothing to prevent the. Resident from writing direct to. the Sultan with* out questioning Balaxa, as he says he did, and this action is so- peculiar that an assertion unfavourable to the Resident’s impartiality might very pertinently be deduced from it, when he combines the functions of the pro secutor and the judge in his own person.. The Resident then proceeds to state the action he took which resulted in Exhibits (F), (G) and ( H ) in which it is elicited that the-gift of £ 250 to. me was given with the knowledge and consent of the Sultan of Lahej and his son, thus adding what is called corroboration to Balaxa’s charge against me. though at the same time it implicated the Sultan of Lahej and his son as Balaxa's accomplices which fact has passed by unnoticed by the enquiry. But it can fairly bo inferred from the Resident’s own. words that he acquired the, knowledge of the connection of the Sultan of Lahej with the contract for the first time when it was brought to his notice by letter (J ).16 This fact was unknown to him at the time of the original inquiry for no use is made of it and it is oaly after the receipt of this letter (J) on the 21st September that any steps are taken to inquire into on the 23rd September with the result already described. This paragraph is probably the only part of the letter (J) that could in any way be used against me, and the fact that this was the only part of this letter that was made use of and that in a way very unfavourable to me, is evident from the Resident’s own report, while the remainder of the letter in which facts are stated that are favourable to my case are slurred over with the remark that the letter has received careful consideration. Can I be blamed, if it occurs to me that the careful consideration said to be given to this letter consisted in extract ing from it any thing that might be twisted into a form unfavourable to myself while all that told in my favour is ignored, and that the whole course of the enquiry was unfair to me and that every effort was made to convict me; any chance of proving my innocence and any thing that told in my favour being carefully blocked or dismissed in contemptuous language. I admit that this language is strong but I feel convinced that an examina tion of the record will of itself justify my deductions, and would shed a flood of light over the whole inquiry and the results arrived at. The Resident in his second report has drawn very unfavourable infere nces from his interpretation of my demeanour and has moreover partly based his belief in my guilt on it, in contrast to the behaviour of my acc users, whose manner he characterizes as very straightforward. It may bo stated again here that that the statements of these persons were taken in my absence and having consequently no fear before their eyes it is not im possible that their manner was bold and unrestrained. To draw such infer ences from the demeanour of my accusers shows conclusively that the Resident has failed to grasp their real position which was actually that of men who were self-confessed criminals, while I was undoubtedly an innocent man, at all events till the contrary had been proved. Yet the Resident presumes to found to a certain extent his belief in my guilt on what he terms the st raightforward manner of my accusers who by their own showing were acc omplices in a shameful transaction, while he draws from my demeanour de ductions unfavourable to myself, who, by all the tenets of law and by even the most elementary rules of justice and fairness, should have been regarded as an innocent man. But such a very simple view of the relative positions in which I and my accusers really stood does not apparently occur to him, though such considerations would most certainly be present in the mind of any unbiassed person who had entered upon an enquiry of this kind with a perfectly open mind., When it is remembered that when these charges were first made known to me 1 had just been discharged from hospital and that only on the under- standing that I left for England that week, that these charges were intimated to me suddenly and I was at once required on honour to reply to them, Is it to be wondered at, that taken by surprise as I was, by the suddenness and gravity of the charges and handicapped by the state of my health, my manner was not perhaps as calm and collected as the Resident evidently expected it should have been consistently with my innocence. It must ba also noted that the contrast between the demeanour of myself and my acc users is not contained in the Resident’s first report and consequently the Resident must have resuscitated the greftter in commuting on the respective demeanour of myself, my accusers is his second reportfgreater part of it from his memory, though if such is the case and that he had really noted our respective demeanours at the first inquiry his remarks would perhaps have carried more weight had they been contained in that report and not carried forward in his memory for a month afterwards before being used against me. Another point which is worthy of notice is that I was not present when* my accusers’ statements were originally taken down, so I am. unable to* speak with certainty, but according to the record, nor was-the Resident present, and in this case it was impossible that, ho should have noted’the demeanour of my accusers. Though the record is silent as to his presence or absence it is of course possible that he might have been present and if he was so it is somewhat extraordinary that the statements are taken below, the signature of Col. Davies only, and no mention is made of the Resident’s presence. It is moreover somewhat difficult to reconcile their reluctance to give evidence with the straightforwardness they are alleged to have shown. Both of these contradictory conclusions are arrived at by the Resident in his second report. It is a somewhat delicate task for a person in my position even though, impelled by necessity and in defence of my own honour, to assail the attitude, and the opinions of officers which are usually considered to carry a certain, weight and whose actions are presumed to be based on competency, exactness, and impartiality, but I believe I have shown your Lordship grounds on which the correctness of their attitude may be fairly called in question, though it is possible that it was unconsciously inimical to me and was caused by the specious nature and subtlety of the charges and their corroboration, which would not unnaturally cause officers inexperienced in such, wiles to fall into error. When I have clearly proved while discussing the preceding ground's, thaft there was no connection between the 300 sovereigns I placed in the Bank with the amount of the gift of 250 sovereigns as alleged by Balaxa, verylittle remains to be added. But it appears that the Resident was materially influenced by this oiroumstanoe which was construed into a coincidence against „ , hni'fr'pU die! I ^ciibfrBda me as the entire record shows. I said in my explanation ( ) that these sovereigns were brought from England and I had kept them in my heavy baggage. Here it may be mentioned that I had come to Arabia In 1901 not in expectation of Govern- mont employ but as a scientific explorer into Yemen. Money was necessary to defray my expenses and to facilitate my entry into Yemen which was ruled by Turkish Officials, and v ; ero gold on account of its numerous con- venionces, was a desideratum. Being occupied with other duties I did not enter Yemen, and the amount remained intact which after the theft alluded to in my explanation I deposited in the Bank. J 1 e o ::;;T eg£0 eni sr dona n rlgnorii pnonioiii sin It may be contended here that had it been a part of the gift it might have remained in my possession as it is alleged it had been already for a li i ' ■ month, and not banked at all, for no one would knowingly oreate a very pertinent piece of evidence against himself. , . . . , . ,, . - o tmoq -i The inference drawn by the Resident against my statement that I had retained this £ 300 in my possession fer some 2 J years would equally apply to my retention of this sum in my possession for one month and consequently this inference is deprived of the significance which lootfied large in the Resident’s mind r Moreover in 1901 it was not so easy to obtain gold in Aden as it is now and considering the possession of gold to be necessary for my purposes I had no choice but to bring it out with-me from home and had I then banked it it would have been converted ifrto silver, the bank £ k T! w .&lt; - Y j U J ».

In this letter most - dama^inor statements are made against my accusers. Government records aris pointed out but nothing Was. done by the Resident. In this letter, moreover, doubt Was thrown iii the clearest manner on the genuineness of B tlaxa’s books from personal experience^ ( and we have clearly demonstrated*iii this appeal that the entries in question, must have been forged and were not supported by Anything substantiating- the transactions with Deoji from Whom the sovereigns alleged to be given,; r .„ •. r rtxirr kfoC cn eurtfhrrYTtv* to me were said to have been obtained').

The enquiry was illegrf and prejudiced, and no conclu sions can rightly be derived from it or such evidence sustained on any plausible grounds of law and justice. GROUND V. The Kesident distinctly intimates that Col. Davies was one of those who brought my supposed bribery to his notice. This circumstance combined with what has been argued above as regards the attitude of the Resident permits the fair presumption that the case of your Lordship's petitioner was prejudiced from the first, and that such prejudice was answerable for so much haste and informality in the proceedings and was the main cause of the ultimate conviction, which could not have been otherwise arrived at. There was no independent evidence to connect me with the loan of Rs. 240 or the gift of £ 250 except the statements of Balaxa and Okaha ( marked B and C ) and^ that the coincid&amp;nce of my placing £ 300 afore- stated in the bank was ikisory and did not in fact exist. In enquiries like the present one, the accused is necessarily in an excep tionally difficult position but my position was far worse. The charges were sprung upon me suddenly and I was required to answer on the spot “ on my honour Having passed most of my life in scientific pursuits I was necessarily unacquainted with forms of procedure, inspection of accounts or the subtleties of cross-examination, or otherwise I might very aptly have turned the tables against my accusers. I merely stood on my honour and was traduced. But the rules of justice, fairplay, and good conscience are equally the same whether in judicial trials or official inquiries. My accusers were mere accomplices, and stood self-condemned; but there was no dread of imminent punishment before them as in judicial trials. The reports are silent as to what measures were taken to induce them to speak the truth or what was alleged to be the truth. No indemnity from the Resident or from still higher quarters was, as far as appears, granted to them, and con sequently they are still at large, and no means seem to have been adopted to prevent them corrupting Government officials in the future. Some pre caution seems to be necessary as this is the second case in which these persona have admitted giving bribes to Government officials. Here some criticism on the value to be attached to the evidence of ac complices as laid down in law courts, c. g. the Indian Evidence Act, and the cases decided thereupon, will not be inappropriate. Here the accomplice is an accused person and there are greater chances of his speaking the truth in the cursory inquiries like the present one, where he runs no. risk and perhaps laughing in his sleeved for he may give out any thing with perfect impunity.21 In Queen Vs. Dwarka, 5 W. E. Cr. 18, it was laid down that the testi mony of an accomplice is not alone sufficient for conviction. The corrobo- ration must be on matters directly: connecting the prisoner with the offence of which he is accused and evidence of two or more accomplices requires con firmation equally with the testimony of one. In this ease the whole of the evidence was given by accomplices. Again in Regina Vs. Malapha, II, Bombay, 196, and in Queen Empress F$. Krishnabhat, I. L. R., I Bom. 319,. it was said:; it is an established rule of practice that an accomplice must be corroborated by independent evidence as to the identity; of every person whom* be impeaches. None is forthcoming in this case. Again in I. L. R. ,8 AH’. 308, Queen Empress Fs.- Ram Saren, it was laid down that there must be some corroboration independent of the ac complice or a co-confessing prisoner to show that the party accused was actually engaged in the- commission of the crime charged against him. In 2 , C. W. N. 6 ST 2 , Rajini Kant Bose Fs. Asan Mullick it was stated that accomplices are not like ordinary witnesses in. respect of credibility, but their evidence is tainted and should be carefully scrutinized before being accepted. In this case the evidence of accomplices was accepted as reliable though uncorroborated. Chief Justice Edge remarked in Goburdkhan’s case, 9 All. 528, that the evidence of an accomplice whether- it is corroborated* or not, must like the evidence ©f any other witness, be considered and weighed^ by the judge who' in doing' so, should not overlook the- position in which the accomplice may at tlue time of giving his evidence stand and- the motives he may: have for stating; what is false.. In Reg. Vs: Mullins, 3 ’ Ex. 526; cited in Bddev, 8 All, 509; Marie J. said “ I quite agree that the confirmation of an accomplice as to the mere fact of a crime harVing been committed or even the particulars of it, is. immaterial unless- the fact of the prisoner being, connected with it is proved', it often happens that an accomplice is a friend of those who committed the- offence with him-, and he would much rather get them out of the scrape and fx an innocent man than his real associates. And the presumption against believing the evidence of an aocomplice is laid down in illustration ( b ) section 114, and is fully commented upon in the Indian Law Reports 14th, Bombay, page 115, The cases cited above apply with greater force to- the present case. I am not called upon to supply a motive for bringing these charges of99 bribery against me. The papers ( F ) and ( H ) are proof positive that the Sultan of Lahej and his son took an active part in the matter though their names were carefully concealed till the second pait of the encpiiiy, on 23rd September 1904 after the receipt of the letter ( J ) on the 21 st. It may therefore be fairly conjectured that they supply a motive for doing so and that this motive had in view my removal from a position in which my duty to Government involved a certain disregard of their interests. From the whole enquiry it is apparent that Saleh Balaxa and Bubakr Okaba were his instruments and Abdulla Umur Orige, whose charge is dropped gives his name also. The following circumstances may supply a reason why my continued employment under Government was not desired by them. In March 1904, Captain Warneford was murdered 'at Am Rija by men of his escort of police belonging to a vassal tribe of the Abdali whose head is the Sultan of Lahej. The Rijai subtribe living at Am Rijai are in a great measure under the suzerainty of the Sultan of Lahej. It was suspected that the murderers of Captain Warneford found at times asylum with these Itajai and in July 1904, at the desire of the Resident, I proceeded to Lahej with a view to enquiry and to enlist the sympathies of the Sultan who had always expressed his desire to effect the capture of those murderers. Whilst at Lahej a man from the Ms khd^mi, and one of the Mansuri subtribes who were known at one time to have given refuge to the murderers came to Lahej and the Sultan decided to give them separate interviews at which by arrangement with His Highness, I was present but concealed. Contrary to the Sultan’s expectations both men stated that the murderers found asylum with the Rijai at or about Am Rija, and notwithstanding the efforts of the Sultan these men adhered to this statement. I determined thereupon to pay a surprise visit to Am Rija. I did so but failed in my purpose. My information as to the presence of the murderers in or about Am Rija just prior to my visit was confirmed by inquiries I made on the spot bnt the murderers had left Am Rija just before my arrival having received warning of my visit. My intentions to trace them were known to none but the Sultan, and the. warning must therefore have emanated directly from him. His complicity in shielding these men would naturally be suspected and duly be reported by me to the Resi dent. Knowing this the Sultan arranged matters so to minimize my report before I was able to aenounce him, for on my return to Aden, I was pro strated with severe illness which confined me to hospital for some time. The Sultan thus got sufficient time to ripen his plans and to spread rumours disparaging to me with the view of depriving me of my post, and of dis crediting me in the eyes of all, so that if I reported anything at all about23 the part he had played l n sheltering Capt. Warneford’s murderers my word could be assadod as that of a corrupt man and would have no value. This is sufficient to establish the inference that the Sultan of Lahei played the prmcpal part in the whole plot and Balaxa and Okaba were 3 Cr9atures ' That “X relations with him or Balaxa were not satisfactory appears from the evidence of Okaba who says that for the last two months the accused did not visit Balaxa. The true reason of my visits to him beino that at the request of the Chief Commissariat Officer I had constantly to find fault with his arrangements to carry out the camel contract. The books of account on which the Resident lays so much stress also, belie my accusers for it is a well known principle of Law (see Evidence Act Sec. 60 ) that evidence should be direct. Balaxa and Okaba never state that these entries were made by them in the course of business, nor was, any persoa making them, called to give evidence. To. prove the genui- neness of these entries of Es. 240, and £ 250, ranging between the dates of 20 th and 24th March, the intervening transactions of 21 st March and 22 nd; March with D-eoji ought to have been substantiated by those books which was. never done and this is fatal to the whole prosecution and proves con clusively that the books did not show entries in the regular course of busi ness, but were purposely arranged to show the two entries against me. o M.. E H. C. TUI 14th September 1887, Say ad Suffirudin, it was laid; down that, entries to. be admitted by way of corroboration of other testimony must be made in the regular course of business.. It is not sufficient to prove that the entries were taken from books, which were regularly and correctly kept. It is nowhere on. record who made these entries in these books, Balaxa nowhere, states that he did so. If he did not make them then the person who did so ; should have been called to speak to the fact as to, whe ther he did so in the regular course of business. Had the books of account been tested by an expert the fraud would’ have been very easily detected. When an opinion has to be formed on matters of account the opinion of an expert in accounts, is a relevant fact. General Mason and Colonel Davies can hardly be termed experts in these matters or if they are they ought to have deposed to their opinion on oath, for then I should have a chance to test their competence. In the absence of their competency being established 1 submit that the value of their opinions is nil. From all the foregoing arguments it is evident that the accusations levelled against me were false,, frivolous and malicious and that the immediate object was to prejudice my superiors against me and procure my removal.And I pray that cn the strength of the above arguments Your Lord ship will be pleased to hold; ( 1 ). That the conclusions arrived at by the Resident set forth in his reports to Government are erroneous and not tenable on any legal or equitable grounds. That the allegations as to the loan of Rs. 240 and the gift of sovereigns 250 were not true, and that my accusers were actuated by pure malice in making these imputations which had for their object my removal from Government service. That the receipt by me of a few ostrich feathers from Am Orige though perhaps contrary to a strict interpretation of Govern ment rules regarding their servants did not of itself deserve the extreme penalty inflicted on me as I was only a temporary servant of Government and as such was not conversant with the rules. That my admission that I owed a bill for forage to Balaxa should not have been construed into the receipt of an illegal ^ratification as has been done by the Resident and that al- though the bill had run for a month or so there was nothing criminal in my act nor deserving of such severe measures as were decreed against me. That each and every relief should be granted to the present petitioner which his injured reputation and blasted prospects entitle him to on a fair consideration of his case, and for this act of mercy, justice and fair play Your Lordship s petitioner, as in duty bound will for ever pray# Your Lordship’s most humble and obedient servant,Itfrom, To, APPENDIX A. No. 163 of 1904. Aden Residency. The 28th August 1904. MAJOlt-GENERAL 11. M. MASON. Political Resident. ADEN, Sir, THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Political Department. BOMBAY, I regret to report that I have been obliged to suspend Mr. Bury^ Extra Assistant Resident, from duty under the following circumstancesr- 2 . For some time past there have been persistent rumours that Mr. Bury, if not actually a partner in the contract for the supply of camels to Government for transport purposes, was receiving money from the Contractor Sheikh Saleh Mahomed Balaxa in consideration of the- assistance he had given him in obtaining the contract, I therefore directed Lt. Colonel Davies First Assistant Resident, to enquire into the matter. 3, Accordingly that officer called the Contractor and his partner Bubakr Okaba on the 23rd instant, when they informed him that Mr Bury had been given the sum of £ 250 by them in consideration of his obtaining the contract for them, that they had advanced Mr. Bury Bs. 240 as a loan, but had taken no bond or receipt from him and did not expect to get the money back and that they had supplied him with forage for his ponies without payment for some months. On the following morning the Contractor and his partner again appeared before Lieut-Colonel Davies made the statements on oath herewith attached and produced their account book showing the entry of the sums £- 250 &amp; Bs. 240. At the same time an Arab named Abdulla Umur Orige ^ho vas also alleged to have paid money to Mr, Bury was called and his sworn statement also attached was taken.4. On the same day at 1 . P. M. J I called Mr. Bury to the Residency Office, read to him the abovementioned statements and asked' him before Ldeut-Colonel Davies what he had to say with regard to them; he seemed very ill at ease and replied ' they have got me over the forage and the feathers and the best thing I can do is to resign'’. I then ordered Mr. Bury the Contractor and Others to be present at 3 O'clock P. M. in order the former miglit be able to crossexamine his accusers. He was quite unable to shake their statements, and their manner throughout was straightforward. 5. That Mr. Bury received the sums of Rs. 240 &amp; 250 sovereigns as stated by Sheikh Saleh Balaxa and Bubkr Okaba is practically proved having been ascertained that he deposited 300 sovereigns with the National Bank of India here on the 22nd April last; as to his receiving 100 sovereigns from Abdulla Umur Origo, the matter will be difficult to prove. Mr. Bury acknowledged to me that he taken the forage and the ostrich feathers without paying for them, as will be seen from tire statement attached; I therefore felt justified in suspending him from dutv. 6 .

I remember driving one morning in March last with Sheikh.Saleh Balaxa to Mr. Bury's Bungalow at about 7 O'clock on which occasion Sheikh Saleh Balaxa gave Mr. Bury 250 sovereigns. Sheikh Saleh Balaxa went to the door of the' bungalow and on Mr. Bury coming out he gave him the money 1 remained.standing some distance off on the road to the bungalow. This sum was given to Mr. Bury as a gift in consideration of his assistance in getting the contract for Sheikh Saleh Balaxa. The above amount is entered in the Expenditure Account Book as being paid to Abdu Umar; by Abdu Umar Mr. Bury is meant. Sheikh Saleh' Balaxa also supplied Mr. Bury with forage for his horses from the month of February to May last; to my knowledge in the latter month I went to Lahej. The sum of 250 sovereigns and the amount paid for forage to Mr. Bury were debited to the Camel Contract Account. The name Abdu Umar was entered for Mr. Bury in the Account Books so that the matter would not come to light. Mr. Bury’s common name among Arabs is Abdulla Mansur. Mr. Bury upto two months ago used to come to Sheikh Saleh Balaxa's house daily, or almost daily. When on coming to the house Mr. Bury found Sheikh Saleh Balaxa in he used to go with him to a room in the upper storey and sit and smoke - with him there If Sheikh Saleh Balaxa was not there he used to go up to the room alone.

Colonel. 1st. Assistant Resident.APPENDIX I, Abdulla Umur Orige, state on oath as follows:- I ara a merchant and broker in Aden. I know Mr. Bury, he is called Abdulla Mansur by Arabs. About two months ago my son Ahmed Abdulla Orige was deported from Aden by Mr. Bury because he took a letter from the Fadthli Sultan addressed to the Besident direct to the Resident and not to him first, and also because I with other merchants petitioned the Resident about 3 months ago to open the trade route to the Asdali country and Dathina which route had been closed owing to the attack by the Shi Saidi on Mr. Bury's party. In consideration of Mr. Bury allowing my son to return to Aden I paid him £ 100 and gave him ostrich feathers worth Rs. 53 in June last when Multan Ahmed Fadthl was in Aden, I gave him the money and the feathers in his bungalow at the Crater. I gave him the money on sovereigns. No one else was present. Mr. Bury warned me to be careful not to tell the matter to anybody especially Abdul Rab.

After I gave Mr. Bury the money and the feathers his servant Marzak came to me and gave me a paper written in Arabic and told me that I should send it to my son who on coming to Aden must show it to one of the two Arabs posted at the Barrier j Gate and that lie would be admitted.

The Resident informed Mr. Bury that he had had every opportunity of calling any witness at the previous emanation, but he brought none, but he said that he was prepared to hear witnesses he had to produce at 2-30 O’clock this after-noon. Mr. Bury replied that as the Resident was of opfiion that a chance had been given to him of producing witnesses at the first hearing he did not now wish to .call any, and although pressed by the Resident to produce witnesses declined. Sd/ II. M, Mason, Major-General. Resident, Aden.appendix J y PRIVATE. The Residency, Rhuj, Catch, 13th September 1004. Dear general Mason. I hope you will forgive what may well be termed unwarrantable interference in affairs that do not now concern me if I venture to address you regarding Mr. Bury. By last mail I heard that he was under suspension on certain charges or receiving bribes &amp;ca. My excuse for writing 10 you on this subject is that Mr. Bury has been known to me for several years and that I was responsible for his employment under Government in tire position he now holds^ and that my intimate knowledge of men and things in A.den, extending over something like 18 years, may be of service to you in this matter. I understand that the charges against Mr. Bury are brought by Sheikh Saleh Balaxa and a man known as Am Oragi. Xow I happen to know both these men very well indeed and to have a very considerable knowledge of their private affairs. My knowledge of them was originally gained as Muni cipal officer and later when 1 st Assistant. Both were mixed up in the case of the late Native Assistant, Muhammad Saleh Jafar, and neither came out of that matter with credit. Commenting on them in turn Sheikh Saleh Balaxa is a Hadrami merchant, who at one tim&amp; was well to do. He however engaged in unprofitable and speculative business and made large losses. He was Agent for the fedthli Sultan and secretly abbetted his illegal exactions on caravans contrary to treaty. He also obtained from the Fadthli Sultan a concession for the manufacture of salt at Makatin and in this venture he employed an Italian without the permission required by Government for the employment of Europeans in Native States. In this salt venture he lost very heavily, and when assessed for income tax this year, he appealed against the order and stated that instead of making any profit, he had lost very considerably. In support of this statement he produced his books before me with extracts which showed that he had lost very considerably and even when he had sold his property he was still on the wrong side. On these grounds I believe I cancelled his asse^nent for income tax, It is truethat a short time after this he obtained the camel contract and no doubt, made some money, but it seems almost incredible that he could have afforded to give a large sum he is alleged to have done to Mr, Bury especially as the Sultan of Lahej was practically tho real contractor’ and as such, would take the lion’s share of the profits. I may also add that this Sheikh Saleh Balaxa became possessed of a considerable quantity of jewellery belonging to one of the late Native Assistant’s wives in a manner that was very dubious. The entries in his accounts of the sums said to have been paid to Mr. Bury are very far from being conclusive evidence of the fact they are intended to prove. In the first place it would have to be shewn that these account^ jjjare the real and only accounts he keeps. Now it is a fact that most traders in Aden keep two if no more sets of accounts, one to show if required aud the other the real account which is never produced. Of this I have had actual experience. It is no uncommon thing for officers’ names to appear in Native State Accounts as having received such and such sums of money though there is absolutely no ground for any such tntry, and Colonel Davies must be well aware that such is the case. So much for mere entries in so called account books. Such entries are far from being conclusive proof of the fact alleged. From these remarks you will sea that in my opinion any statement made by Saleh Bdaxa should be received with very great caution. As regards Am Orige. He is well known in Aden as being a most astute intriguer and he has been mixed up in every political intrigue for many years past. To mention some late instances- it was he who tried to wreck the Upper Aulaki Treaty and who brought on Mr. Bury the attack by the Audilli &amp;ca. when proceeding to get the treaty signed. Prior to this his son had gone to the Upper Aulaki country and B^ha representing himself as the Agent to the Resident duly empowered to negotiate treaties, and in his name made promises of thousands of dollars rifles &amp;ca. He had absolutely no authority for any such proceeding and jn order to stop the mischief his father Am Orige was informed that he and his whole family would be turned out of Aden unless his son returned in the shortest possible time. It was more than suspected that his son stirred up a fanatical and religious feeling against us in B^ha and the upper Aulaki country. The family are Bedthanis and do a considerable part of the trade of that country with Aden. During the Bec^ia and Upper Aulaki negotiations for treaties Am Orage deliberately tried tofoist on us persons of no consequence as chiefs and influential persons Am Onge was also concerned in the Muhamad Saleh J afar affair in ' most discreditable manner and when I renm™1 n- . , , , , , 0011 1 re dU‘red him to produce his accounts he declared that he never kept any. This was barely four years ago Has he since then commenced to keep accounts or has he^ done so far the purpose of this case ? A reference to Sir O'M Cr4-h will, I know, result in confirmation of my opinion of Am Orage He is a man of execrable character, a low intriguer and a man whose oath should place very little reliance on and he is absolutely disloyal both to the Resident and Government. If I were in Aden I could ’give you chapter and verse for every statement I have made regarding these two men. , • t . / I have known Mr. Bury perhaps better than any other man in Aden and as I was mainly instrumental in his being employed bv Government, I feel myself to a certain degree responsible for him and to put it on the lowest possible ground it is incredible to me that be- could have acted as is alleged in such a clumsy and disengenuous way when he lias had many better opportunities of appropriating money ami lias not done so. The object of these charges is no doubt to remove Mr. Bury from Government employment so as to again, establish a Native intermediary, who would no doubt prove more amenable to the views of certain people than he would. A convincing instance of the evils which arise through Native assistance &amp;ca. is that of the late Native Assistant Mahummad Saleh Jafar and when he was dismissed the post was abo lished for reasons which the correspondence on the subject will show, aud I then personally took over the Arabic Department. I can only again ask your indulgence if I have gone beyond my duty but knowing Mr. Bury so intimately as I do* I am sure that lie is incapable of the acts attributed to him and I feel it my duty to put such knowledge as I have, before you for your consideration, I am yours sincerely- Sd/ H, M, Abud*.Aden, 23rd September 1904. Q — tIow do 3’ 0l i explain where you get the 300 sovereigns which you deposited in the National Bank, Aden, on the 22 nd April 1904. A... I came out in October or November 1901 and with the hope &lt;■&gt;- getting into Yemen I brought with me the sum of 300 sovereigns. Ihis I kept with me on joining the Boundary Cjmmissio^ in January 1902. I always carried the sum with me when I took my heavy baggage. Y' hen I left my heavy baggage I kept the sum in one of the boxes. About April this year Lit^t—Carter I. M.S. had some property stolen from his bungalow, it then struck me that it would be advisable for me to bank my 300 sovereigns; this I did about the end of April last. It had nOu occured to me to place this sum of money in the Bank during the previous 2b years nor did I think it advisable to do so as I was not sure that I would be able to get sovereigns if I went into Yemen.

Mason, Political Resident. ADEN To, The Secretary to Government, Political Department. BOMBAY Sir, With reference to your telegram of the 20 th instant, referring to my letter No. 163 dated the 28th ultimo, I have the honour to inform yon that I have received Colonel Abud's letter therein mentioned. 2. In accordance with His Excellency the Governor's wishes I have carefully considered Colonel Abud’s opinion of the ca«e, an 1 I have the honour to state that in the first instance I have personally made a thorough enquiry into the matter. As stated in pragraph 2 of my letter above quoted there were for some time past persistent rumours that Mr. Bury was receiving sums of money from the Camel Contractor Lieut Colonel Davies also brought the matter to my notice. As these reports were very frequent I told Lieut. Colonel Davies that I did not consider it, fair to Mr. Bury that he should proceed on leave to England without being given a chance of refuting them. Lieut-Colonel Davies sent for the camel Contractor Sheikh Saleh Balaxa and his partner Bubakr Okaba and called for their account books, but it was with great difficulty that that officer was able to elicit from them any information regarding the matter. However they both eventually acknowledged that they had paid 250 - m* 4 . v sovereigns to Mr. Bury and pciat'd out the entry of the transaction in &lt;• their account books.I would draw attention to the fact that Sheikh Saleh Balaxa mid Bubkr Okaba did not come forward of their own accord and make th 3 statement that they had given money to Mr. Bury. 4 . After reading the sworn statements taken down by Lieut-Colonel Davies, I personally conducted an enquiry into the case and I have no doubt from Mr. Bury's manner throughout that he is guilty of the charge of taking money from Sheikh Saleh Balaxa and his partner. As to the allegation that Mr. Bury received 100 sovereigns from Abdulla Oiige, the matter would be impossible to prove as the man keeps no account books and as no witnesses. 6 * I have had reason to believe that the Sultan of Lahej was in some way connected with the Camel contract. I therefore on the 23id instant during the examination of his account books asked Sheikh Saleh Balaxa regarding the matter. He informed me that the Sultan’s son Sultan AU bin Ahmed was a partner in the contract and that it was with his consent as well as that of Bubakr Okaba that he paid tire 250 sovereigns to Mr. Bury. As Sub an Ali bin Ahmed was in Lahej at the time and there was no likelihood of his coming into Aden to give evidence on the subject. I asked Sheikh Saleh Balaxa it he could write in Arabic statino- on oath that it was with the consent of Sultan Ali bin Ahmed o and Bubakr Okaba that he paid the 250 sovereigns to Mr. Bury and that he was sure ths Sultan would confirm the statement. Sheikh Saleh Balaxa expressed his willingness to do this. I therefore sent his statement (English translation attached herewith) to the Sultan of Lahej with my letter dated 23rd instant, copy also attached, asking him to request his son to confirm or deny a statement of Sheikh Saleh Balaxa. Sultan Ali bin Ahmed put his signature to the statement to show that he confirmed what was stated therein and it was returned to me by the Sultan of Lahej in his letter of the 24th instant (English translation attached ). 7. I most carefully examined the account books of Sheikh Saleh Balaxa in the first instance and did so again on the 23rd instant, and I have satisfied myself that the books produced are the real business books of the firm. The sums mentioned as having been given to Mr. Bury are entered under the name of Abdu Umar whereas he is known as Abdulla Mansoor. This is explained however by the fact that the contractors out of gratitude to Mr. Bury did not let the name by which lie is 1 noti&gt; e igstant Nation explani his gumatter might ne is known to appear in their books in order that the not be found out, _ S ' 1 atteoh a statement made before me by Mr. Bury on the 23rd mstant, relative to the 300 sovereigns which he deposited in the National Bank oflndia, Aden, on the 22nd April last, I consider his explanation most^satisifactory and that it confirms my opinion as to his guilt.

At the same time an Arab named Abdulla Lmur Onge, who was also alleged to have paid money to Mr. Bury was called and his sworn statement, also attached, was taken. 4 On the same day at 1 p. M. I called Mr. Bury to the Residency Office, read to him the above-mentioned statements and asked him before Lieutenant- Colonel Davies what he had to say with regard to them; he seemed very ill at ease and replied “ they have got me over the forage and the feather and the best thing I can do is to resign/’ I then ordered Mr. Bury, the contractor and others to be present at 3 o’clock p.m. in order that the former might be able to cross-examine his accusers. He was quite unable to shake their statements, and their manner throughout was straight forward. 5. That Mr. Bury received the sums of Rs. 240 and 250 sovereigns as stated by Sheikh Saleh Balaxa and Bubaker Okaba, is practically proved, it having been ascertained that he deposited 300 sovereigns with the National j Bank of India here on the 22nd April last; as to his receiving 100 sovereigns from Abdulla Lmur Orige, the matter will be difficult to prove. Mr. Bury acknowledged to me that he had taken the forage and the ostrich feathers with out paying for them, as will be seen from the statement attached; I therefore felt justified in suspending him from duty. 6. I have informed Mr. Bury that under the circumstances he cannot avail himself of the privilege leave granted to him, nor can he leave Aden without permission. 7. I have the honour to solicit the orders of Government in the matter. On the sworn statements made by the Camel Contractor Sheikh Salem Mahomed Balaxa, his partner Bubaker Okaba and Abdulla Lmur Orige being read over to Mr. Bury, he was asked by the Resident what he had to say ; he replied “ they have me over the forage and the ostrich feathers and the best thing I can do is to resign.” I, Sheikh Saleh Mahomed Balaxa, state on oath as follows :— I am a merchant and have the Government contract for supplying camels. I know Mr. Bury ; he is commonly known as “ Abdulla Mansur ” by Arabs. He is an Assistant to the Resident. He comes to me constantly and has a smoke with me and obtains forage from me for his horses. I supply him with forage without payment in consideration of his having obtained the camel con tract for me in * February last, and of his having been of great help to me on my first starting the contract. On the 24th March last at about 7 a.m , my partner Bubaker Okaba and I drove in a carriage to Mr. Bury’s bungalow : I stood near the entrance of the bungalow and called Mr. Bury ; Bubakr Okba 16 j the amount is entered as paid to Abdu Lmar by myself , by Abdu t. mar is meant Mr Bury. I did not enter his real name as I was afraid that the matter would be found out. I produce the Expenditure Account Book showing the entry above referred to. There is also an entry on the same page of Rs 240 paid to Mr. Bury, under the name of Abdu Lmar on the 20th March last. I paid this amount to Mr. Bury myself in my house in the Crater in the day-time (afternoon). He promised to refund this amount, but has not done so up to date.

I am a partner of Sheikh Saleh Mahomed Balaxa in the Government camel contract. I remember driving one morning in March last with Sheikh Saleh Balaxa to Mr. Bury’s bungalow at about 7 o’clock, on which occasion Sheikh Saleh Balaxa gave Mr. Bury 250 sovereigns. Sheikh Saleh Balaxa went to the door of the bungalow and on Mr. Bury coming out he gave him the money. I remained standing some distance off on the road to the bungalow. This sum was given to Mr. Bury as a gift in consideration of his assistance in getting the contract for Sheikh Saleh Balaxa. The above amount is entered in the Expenditure Account book as being paid to Abdu Umar ; by Abdu Umar Mr. Bury is meant. Sheikh Saleh Balaxa also supplied Mr. Bury with forage for his horses from the month of February to May last to my knowledge, in the latter month I went to Lahej. The sum of 250 sovereigns and the amount paid for forage to Mr. Bury was debited to the Camel Contract Account. The name Abdu Umar was entered for Mr. Burykin the account books so that the matter would not come to light. Mr. Bury’s common name among Arabs is Abdulla Mansur. Mr. Bury up to two months ago used to come to Sheikh Saleh Balaxa’s house daily, or almost daily. When on coming to the house Mr. Bury found Sheikh Saleh Balaxa in he used to go with him to a room in the upper storey and sit and smoke with him there ; if Sheikh Saleh Balaxa was not at home he used to go up to the room alone.

I know Mr. Bury ; he is called Abdulla Mansur by Arabs. About two months ago my son, Ahmed Abdulla Orige, was deported from Aden by Mr. Bury because he took a letter from the Eadthli Sultan addressed to the Resident direct to the Resident, and not to him first, and also because I with other merchants petitioned the Resident about three months ago to open the trade route to the Audali country and Dathina, which route had been closed owing to the attack by the Dathina on Mr. Bury’s party. In consideration of Mr. Bury allowing my son to return to Aden I paid him £100 and gave him ostrich feathers worth Rs. 53 in June last when Sultan Ahmad Eadthli was in Aden. I gave him the money and the feathers in his bungalow at the Crater. I gave him the money in sovereigns. No one else was present. Mr. Bury warned me to be careful not to tell the matter to anybody, especially Abdul Rab. My servant, Bubakr Dahaim, carried the ostrich feathers for me as far as the mosque of Sheikh Abdulla which is just below Mr. Bury’s bungalow. After I gave Mr. Bury the money^ and the feathers his servant, Murzak, came to me and gave me a paper written in Arabic and told me that I should send it to my son, who, on coming to Aden, must show it to one of the two Arabs posted at the Barrier Gate, and that he would be admitted.

A. Hill, Esq., G.I.E., Secretary to the Goverement o£ Bombay Political Department. ^ With reference to your telegram of the 20th instant referring to my letter No. 163, dated the 28th ultimo, I have the honour to inform you that I have received Colonel Abud’s letter therein mentioned. 2. In accordance with His Excellency the Governor’s wishes I have care fully considered Colonel Ahud’s opinion of the case, and I have the honour to state that, in the first instance, I personally made a thorough enquiry into the matter. As stated in paragraph 2 of my letter above quoted there were for some time past persistent rumours that Mr. Bury was receiving sums of money from the camel contractor. Lieutenant-Colonel Davies also brought the matter to my notice. As these reports were very frequent I told Lieutenant- Colonel Davies that I did not consider it fair to Mr, Bury that he should pro ceed on leave to England without being given a chance of refuting them. Lieutenant-Colonel Davies sent for the Camel Contractor Sheikh Saleh Balaxa and his partner, Bubaker Okaba, and called for their account books, but it was with great difficulty that that officer was able to elicit from them any informa tion regarding the matter. However, they both eventually acknowleged that they had paid 250 sovereigns to Mr. Bury and pointed out the entry of the transaction in their account books. 3. I would draw attention to the fact that Sheikh Saleh Balaxa and Bubaker Okaba did not come forward of their own accord and make the state ment that they had given money to Mr. Bury. 4. After reading the sworn statements taken down by Lieutenant-Colonel Davies, I personally conducted an enquiry into the case, and I have no doubt from Mr. Bury’s manner throughout that he is guilty of the charge of taking money from Sheikh Saleh Balaxa and his partner. 5. As to the allegation that Mr. Bury received 100 sovereigns from Abdulla Orige, the matter would be impossible to prove as the man keeps no account books and has no witnesses. 6 . 1 have had reason to believe that the Sultan of Lahej was in some way connected with the camel contract; I therefore on the 23rd instant during the examination of his account books asked Sheikh Saleh Balaxa regarding the matter. He informed me that the Sultan’s son, Sultan Ali bin Ahm&amp;d was a partner in the contract and that it was with his consent as well as that of Bubaker Okaba that he paid the 250 sovereigns to Mr. Bury. As Sultan Ali bin Ahmad was in Lahej at the time and there was no likelihood of his coming into Aden to give evidence on the subject, I asked Sheikh Saleh Balaxa if he would write in Arabic stating on oath that it was with the consent of Sultan Ali bin Ahmad and Bubaker Okaba that he paid the 250 sovereigns to Mr. Bury and that he was sure the Sultan would confirm the statement. Sheikh Saleh Balaxa expressed his willingness to do this. I therefore sent his statement (English translation attached herewith) to the Sultan of Lahej with my letter dated 23rd instant, copy also attached, asking him to request his son to confirm or deny the statement of Sheikh Saleh Balaxa. Sultan i bin Ahmad put his signature to the statement to show that he confirmed what was stated herein and it was returned to me by the SuHan of Lahej m his letter of the 24th instant (English translation attached). 7. I most carefully examined the account books of Sheikh Saleh i in the first instance and did so again on the 23rd instant, and have satis e myself that the books produced are the real business books of the fi™* sums mentioned as having been given to Mr. Bury are entered under the nam of Abdu Umur, whereas he is known as Abdulla Munsoor. This is exp ame , however, by the fact that the contractors out of gratitude to Mr. Bury i ^ let the name by which he is known appear in their books in order a e matter might not be found out. 8. I attach a statement made before me by Mr. Bury on the 23rd instant relative to the 300 sovereigns which he deposited [m the Nationa ^ 7N 1 it 1 India, Aden, on the 22nd April last.^ I consider his explanation most unsatis factory and that it confirms my opinion as to his guilt. I, Saleh Balaxa, state on oath :— That by the consent of Sultan Ali bin Ahmad who is a partner in the camels and also Bubaker Okaba I paid £250 in the month of March 1904 to Abdulla Munsoor who is called Mr. Bury as a gift from us in consideration of the assistance he rendered us in securing the contract and I am confident that Sultan Ali bin Ahmad will confirm this statement.

But, oh friend, as this case might entail many long statements and questions and that you may demand the presence of our son hereafter, so you must know that he will not appear in this matter or in any other one connected with the contract, because he has already authorized Sheikh Saleh Balaxa to act on his behalf in all matters connected with the contract and also because our son does not under stand the business!

A. —I came out in October or November 1901 and with the hope of get ting into Yamen I brought with me the sum of 300 sovereigns. This I kept by me on joining the Boundary Commission in January 1902. I always carried the sum about with me when I took my heavy baggage. When I left 8my besvy baggage I kept the sum m one of tbe boxes. About April this year Lieutenant Carter, I.

Mr. Bury replied that as the Resident was of opinion that a chance had been given him of producing witnesses at the first hearing he did not now wish to call any—and, although pressed by the Resident to produce wit nesses, declined.

From—W T- Morison, Esq., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, roJitical Department, J To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. 1 am directed to forward copies of a letter and telegram from the Political Resident, Aden, requesting sanction to the employment of Mr. G. W. Bury, as an Assistant to the Political Resident, with effect from 1 st April 1903. The Government of India have already sanctioned the grant of a monthly allowance of R100 to Mr. Bury for accompanying the Aden Boundary Commission. It seems to the Governor in Council that it would he advisable to retain Mr. Bury’s services at Aden for so long as the Boundary Commission continues, and I am to submit this proposal for the favourable consideration of the Government of India. The arramgeraent as to salary and travelling allowances proposed by the Political Resident seems to be suitable. 2. I am to ask that if there is no objection, the orders of the Government of India may be communicated to me by telegram. Letter No. 116, dated 5th May 1903. Telegram, dated 16th idem. Vide your letter No, 1165-E. A., dated 9th June 1902. No. 116, dated Aden Residency, the 10th May 1903. From— Brigadiek-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. When the Boundary Commission left Aden January 1902, Mr. G. W. Bury, who was then in the employment of the British Museum, was permitted to accompany it as naturalist. Subsequently Government sanctioned for Air. Bury an allowance of R100 per mensem in consideration of his placing his intimate knowledge of Arabs and Arab manners in this part of Arabia at the disposal of the Commission ; and later on a further allowance of R65 per mensem was granted as horse allowance. 2, Mr. Bury’s services have been of value to the Commission, and lately he has been employed by this Residency in dealing with the Chiefs who have been in Aden on business of various kinds. He has already rendered consider- ? able assistance in several matters of importance. I understand from Mr. Bury that he w 7 as once in the 3rd (Militia) Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, and that he intended to enter the army but failed. Being of an adventurous disposition, he went to Morocco, where he learnt to talk Arabic, and saw some fighting with the Moors. He then returned to England, but soon afterwards came out to the Somali Coast and Aden. Eor nearly a year he lived among the Ahl Ban (an Abdali Section) for the purpose of thoroughly mastering Arabic, and of gaining an insight into the customs of a race in which be had learnt to take a special interest. Eor the last six years Mr. Bury has lived almost continuously in Southern Arabia collecting archaeological and zoological information on behalf of various scientific societies. In his capacity as a scientific explorer he has visited many parts of the hinterland of Aden, and has acquired the dialects of most of the tribes within our protec torate. His acquaintance with the language and manners of the Arabs is such that he can pass as an Arab with ease and can penetrate into almost any part of the interior with little risk. 3. The post of Native Assistant at Aden was abolished some years ago under circumstances which are well known to Government, and I am not prepared to recommend its restoration. Nevertheless, the want of some one who can talk fredy to the Chiefs and people, and to whom they will express themselves with less restraint than they do to the regular officers of the Residency is much felt. Further, a person with a complete command of theInnsmase and perfect knowledge of Arab manners and customs, can obtain a more accurate knowledge of facts than is easily reached by a Political Officer, even although lie may be able to speak Arabic fluently. In dealing, as we have now to do, with Chiefs and tribes with whom our previous acquain tance is but slight, we are greatly in want of some person who can undertake preliminary negociations, and at the same time ascertain whether the indivi duals with whom we are treating are exactly what they profess to be. The latter is sometimes a very difficult matter ', yet it is evident that the whole success or failure of our efforts may depend on a correct appreciation of the exact status of an individual Sheikh or Chief. This is work which would ordinarily be undertaken by a Native Assistant, but Mr. Bury can perform it equally well, and he is besides an educated Englishman, in whom, I believe, complete confidence may be placed. 4 . I would, therefore, propose that Mr. Bury be appointed to this Residency as an Extra Assistant for at least as long as the Boundary Commis sion continues; and that he should receive a salary of R 500 per mensem, with travelling allowance as for other Assistant Residents at Aden. Mr. Bury has hitherto been in receipt of R 300 per mensem from the British Museum, to which the allowances sanctioned by Government added R 165, making a , total of R465. His connection with the British Museumjhas now terminated, and if not given employment by us, he would, in the natural course of things, return to England. I think it would be unfortunate if Mr. Bury’s services, now of peculiar value to us, were not utilized, and I may add, that Colonel Abud, himself an excellent Arabic scholar, is impressed with the fitness of Mr. Bury for the necessary and important work described above. The salary proposed is, I venture to think, very moderate, considering the confidential nature of the employment, and the fact that Mr. Bury, as an Assistant Resident, will necessarily be put to greater expense than when travelling, or staying in Aden, as a private individual. I hope Government will be able to give early consideration to this proposal and will favour us, if possible, with a reply by telegram. Enclosure 2.

W. Bury as Extra Assistant Besident, Aden, for a period of 12 months with effect from the 1st April 1903,1 am directed to state that the Political ’itesi- dent, Aden, reports that the intercourse of the Aden Besidency with the Chiefs and tribes of the Aden Protectorate has lately become much more frequent then was formerly the case, that the demarcation of the frontier will necessarily give rise to many questions which would not otherwise demand attention, and that these questions will need careful handling and may need locaL enquiry. He, therefore, urges that the Political Besident ought to have at his disposal some officer possessing a considerable knowledge of the characteristics of the Arabs near Aden, and the power of communicating with the Chiefs in their language, whom he can on occasion send into the interior. General own Maitland states further that Mr. Bury’s services have been of the greatest value in establishing a better understanding with the Chiefs, and in conducting negotiations for the treaties which have lately been entered into, and that Mr. Bury is still almost essential to the Political Besident, the more so as the number of Arabic-speaking officers available for employment at Aden is small, and Government have now to deplore the loss of the especially valuable services of Captain Warneford, the only other junior officer in their employ thoroughly acquainted with the work done in the hinterland. 2 . Pending a conclusion on the policy discussed in your letter No. 464 E.-A., dated the 10th February 1904, and the negotiation of treaties with the Upper Aulaki Chief of Nisab and the Beda Chief, His Excellency the Governor in Council entirely concurs with these views, and thinks it would be most in advisable to part with Mr. Bury at present. If it should eventually be decided to post an Assistant permanently in the hinterland, Mr. Bury has all the quali fications for the post. I am, therefore, to request that the Government of India may be moved to accord sanction to Mr. Bury’s services as an Extra Assistant Besident at Aden being retained for a further period of one year on the same terms as hitherto.
