It also therefore covers the negotiations surrounding the Muscat Civil Air Agreement (1934), and subsequent amendments to modify the level of rent paid to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Draft copies of the Muscat Agreement can be found on folios 266-273 and 307-318, while the final print edition copies can be found on folios 189-192 and 221-222. A copy of the Kuwait Air Navigation Regulations can be found on folios 366-367, and a copy of the Kuwait Air Agreement can be found on folios 329-331.The file contains further correspondence regarding trouble experienced by Imperial Airways in claiming its rebate on aviation fuel, and efforts made by British authorities to obtain further duty exemptions for the airline. It also covers special authorisations issued under the agreement to permit aircraft to fly over and land in Oman.The abandonment of Gwadur in 1938 – as a result of its unsuitability for seaplanes – and the transfer of Imperial Airways services to Jiwani (also spelt Jiunri in the file) is documented by the correspondence.The main correspondents are as follows: the Persian Gulf Political Resident; the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat (Claude Edward Urquhart Bremner and Ralph Ponsonby Watts); the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India (the Department of External Affairs from 1937); and the Agent to the Governor General, Resident and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan. The file also contains correspondence with officials of the following departments of the British Government: the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, and the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Gwadur Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><subject><topic>Seaplane bases</topic></subject><subject><topic>Muscat Civil Air Agreement (1934)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Agent to the Governor-General, Resident and Chief Commissioner, Baluchistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Khan of Kalāt, rulers of Kalāt</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Jīwani</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00020a#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00020a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00020a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00020a#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
