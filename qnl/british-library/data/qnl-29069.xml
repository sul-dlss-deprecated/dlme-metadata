Subject : Muscat State Budget for 1943 . The finances of Muscat seem to be in a very satisfactory position. Revenue exceeded the budget estimate by over 1 lakh, while expenditure yraa wore than 10,000 Rupees less than had been estimated; this resulted in a saving of Rs. 2j6fi86. Owing to the appreciation of the dollar and the baiza, the State made a profit of Rs. 1,26326. faJl -;o The Political Agent at Muscat and the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf agree that this admira&amp; state of affairs is due to the Finance Officer Khan Sahib Maqbul Husain. A statement is also attached showing the expenditure of the War Subsidy- granted to the Sultan by H.M.G-. in return for 'necessary facilities' in his -3 territory and territorial -waters. ftM n. 0 ^.

Copy of a letter No. C/844 dated the 30th Decemoer 1941 from the political Agent, Muscat to the Hon 1 Die the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Muscat. I have the honour to forward the budget statements of the Muscat Government for the year 1942. I have included in the statements the corresponding figures from the 1941 budget, for purposes of comparison, it will be seen that the distribution of expenditure has been considerably revised by the Finance Officer, Khan Sahib Maqbul Hussain Khan; and I am satisfied that this revision is judicious from the point of view of audit and control of expenditure. Before making any general .comment, I would ask you to note that the revenue .figures for the Wilayet of Sohar have now been included in the general heads of revenue and expenditure, as you know the Wilayet o£ Sohar has .in the past history of Muscat been a favourite resort of disgruntled relatives of the ruling family; and I consider that it is very satisfactory that its separate identity, even in the financial field, should cease to exist. 2. I have put the -explanation of the increases and decreases astegainst 1941 into-the form of-an appendix to this letter. The upsho^t of the whole budget is that we have reduced our anticipated revenue ‘from 7i lakhs, as budgetted in 1941, to’ 7 lakhs; while the expenditure is budgetted at 6 lakhs 56 thousand (44 thousarid being the amount budgetted for 'reserve') as against 6 lakhs 67 thousand last year. The budgetted revenue has been reducea to allow for expected fall in receipts due to the prei budget does not include the war 2 lakhs, 40 thousand per annum# sit uation. This FQAEIQN SECRETARY'S LETTER Nft DATE 3.ASC«rvffl}0 18 - 5 - 5-1942r-v 71 ussier*- I o 'i i Pt 1 lst January 1941, the cash reserve of the State was about 2*i lakhs, and Investments a little ever lakh si PlKurss are not yet available up to the ena of 1941: but on 1st December. 1941 the cash reserve had risen to 3 lakhs, 19 thousand, investments ’ being the same, m addition to this, the Sultan had drawn '^s.74 000 just before leaving foijQhofar. this sum he is not accounting for J but some part may be taken as still unspent. The balance of the ’ war Subsidy on 1st January, 1941,“ was'just about a lakh; and it was roughly the same on 1st December, 1941. m addition to this, the Sultan took 50 thousand with him to Dhofar. This sum, again has passed out of our purview; but a considerable portion of it may be taken as still unspent. 4. tou may consider that the considerable increase in the cash reserve which has taken place, is not entirely satisfactory. 1 have, however, recently put forward two schemes for public utilities w hich will reduce if by 17 thousand; and have also other possibilities in mind, which I am hoping to have an -opportunity to discuss with the Sultan before I leave, which would help to get the State's reserves into a more satisfactory form than cash. 5. I have not yet, of course, got the receipt and expenditure statement for the last quarter of 1941; but can see how the old budget has worked from the figures up to 30th September, 1941. The proportionate ecs-tmx estimated receipts for nine months came to 5 lakhs, 64 thousand; and actual receipts were 5 lakhs, 34 thousand, proportionate estimated expenditure comes to 5 lakhs, and actual expenditure almost exactly the same. (There is actually a saving of one thousand). We may therefore expect a deficiency 1 ' at the end of the year oi just under 40 thousand; whereas the excess of budgetted receipts over budgetted expenditure was 85 thousand. Nett saving should therefore be approximately 45 thousand; and this is almost exactly the sum allotted to 'Reserve' in the present budget. +&lt;.£. m 6. as regards the War Subsidy: gross receipts from the beginning of the war to 31st December 194i came to 5 lakhs, 59 thousand. Expenditure for 1939/1940, as stated by His Highness, totalled ; 2 lakhs, 17 thousand; and expenditure for eleven months of 1941 has been just over two lakhs. Total saving since the subsidy began is therefore, as stated above, roughly \i lakhs. This agrees with - the balances handed over by His Highness to Khan Sahib Maqbul Hussain, via. one lekh in Muscat anddialf ~lakh with His Highness in Thofar.

Please see Minute at P.Z. 7121/34. The Muscat Budget Estimates for 1935 forwarded by the Resident, provide for revenue and expenditure amounting in each case to Rs.6,21,320, without including in the revenue estimate the balance of the arms traffic subsidy from 11 th February to the end of the year, which has recently been sanctioned. If the 1*^4. SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTED \ 5 JUL 1955 subsidy is taken into account there should be a surplus in 19^5 of approximately Rs. 89,000 on the basis of the estimates. This position is on the whole fairly satisfactory, but as Colonel Fowle again points out, it has only been reached by the exercise of the most stringent economy, particularly as regards the Social Services. On/2 . On the other hand it will be seen that the estimates allow this year for a modest expenditure on education of * Rs.2,400. It will be remembered that the school had to be closed down^ror financial reasons during 1933/34. With regard to the use to be made of the extension of the arms subsidy, please see Colonel Fowle's express letter at P.Z. 1472/35, in which he outlined a programme for expending it upon useful social services. It will be seen that the actual revenue of the State during the year 1934, (including of course the arms subsidy of Rs. 1^00,000) was Rs. 775,124, and the expenditure Rs.665,824, leaving a substantial surplus of Rs.^09,300. These^/eB.are considerably in excess of the estimates furnished by the Resident at Flag ^. There will be an opportunity for discussing with Colonel Fowle when he is in London next September, the question whether the arms subsidy should finally be terminated at the end of this year when the present extension expires, or whether it might not be desirable to extend itfor a further period. n jch -v j SEEN COMMITTER 15 jui-r .coigiprsm-a..

For the position in regard to the Arms Traffic Subsidy, please see the relative parts of the minute on P*Z. 1E38/32 a^ flag I• The subsidy would normally have come to an end with the accession of the Sultan on the 10th February 1932, but it was decided in 1932 to extend it for a further period of three years,, up to February 1935, in view of the precarious financial position of the Muscat State* During the last three years the State has made strenuous efforts to put its financial house in order* These efforts have met with a considerable degree of success, but the improvement in the position has only been obtained by pursuing a policy of the most stringent economy. The Civil List (which here, as in other Arab States, is the largest single item on the expenditure side of the Budget) has been cut, and this has inevitably caused a certain amount of discontent among the Sultan’s relations; Muscat’s only school has had to be closed down and social services are now practically non-existent; the pay of the Levy Corps has been seriously cut down, the basic pay of the Sepoy having been further reduced from &amp;5 to 20 rupees per mensem in 1932, following on a previous reduction from Rs.30 to Rs.25 in 1931, and this has resulted in a serious decline in the discipline and efficiency of the Corps; finally it may be mentioned that sanitary conditions in Muscat are described as deplorable, and this is mainly to be attributed to the lack of the necessary funds for maintaining an efficient sanitary service. In spite of these drastic economies it will be seen from the comparative figures of revenue and expenditure/ l' 1expenditure for the years 1932-33 and 1933-34 furnished by the Political Resident and enclosed in the Government of India’s letter of the 10th November now submitted that without the assistance of the Arms Traffic Subsidy, the Muscat Budget could have been • a balanced only in 1933 and not in 1932 or 19 34. 2. While on deputation in this country in April 1933 the Political Resident recorded a note which will be found at flag H, representing that the Muscat Administration had been cut down to the bone, and expressing himself strongly in favour of retaining the Arms Traffic Subsidy for a further short period of say two years beyond the date on which it is at present due to expire (10th February 1935). Colonel Fowle suggested that he might wait for a few months longer before putting forward official proposals to the Government of India for the further extension of the subsidy. the Spring of this year the Sultan enquired whether there was any hope of the subsidy being continued until December 1935, the close of the Muscat financial year, whereupon the Resident addressed the Government of India in his letter of the 29th May (enclosed in the Government of India’s letter of 10th November) recommending that the subsidy should be extended for one full year, i.e. until February 1936. The Government of India now propose to continue paying the subsidy up to the end of December 1935 only ’’pending further examination of the issues involved”. It appears from this that their present intention is to make a payment to the Sultan of some Rs.90,000, and not to pay a full annual instalment of the subsidy, though this is not quite clear. Prima facie t here seems to be a case for granting a somewhat more generous extension of/ i2956 6000 7/51 3 Minute Paper. POLITICAL Department. of the subsidy, but there is perhaps a good deal t o be said for waiting to see how the Muscat financil situation develops next year before•deciding to extend the subsidy further. It may be noted in this connection that if the actual figures for revenue collected in 1933 (at flag A) are compared with the Budget estimates (at flag B) the actual revenue for 1933 is seen to have exceeded the 9 Budget estimates by almost Rs. 1,00,000. It is just possible, though perhaps unlikely, that a similar buoyancy in the revenue during 19 35 might make a further extension of the subsidy beyond December 1935 unnecessary. It may be mentioned that we have not as yet received the usual detailed statement showing actual revenue and expenditure during 1933, but this is no doubt due to the absence of a Financial Adviser at Muscat* Captain Alban*s time at Muscat as Financial Adviser expired last summer, and we have not yet heard of the appointment of a successor. In the circumstances explained above it is submitted that the Secretary of State's approval may be given to the Government of Indian proposal to extend the Arms Traffic Subsidy up to the end of December, 1935.

There/There is a strong case for this extension, and it is perhaps to be regretted that the Government of India have not accepted the Resident’s proposal that it should be granted for a full year from February 1936« The arrangements now in contemplation in connection with Khor Quwair are an additional argument for maintaining the stability of the State and keeping the goodwill of its ruler.

The financial situation as disclosed by Captain Alban’s extremely interesting report (P.Z.1418/33) is iairly satisfactory and gives some ground for cautious optimism as to the future in spite of the Stated debts and the impending cessation of the Arms Subsidy of Rs.1,00,000 in 1935. One of the most encouraging features is the buoyancy of the revenue for the last two months of the year 1932 which appears to have exceeded Captain Alban’s anticipations. The year closed with a surplus of over Rs.18,000 which with accrued savings from the previous year left a balance of over Rs.40,000 for debt redemption (PZ.1445/33J, pp. 3-4.) The state is budgetting for a surplus of Rs.23,75C in 1933 (see ends. to P.Z. 1448/33,pp-nubered 2-3) but as from 1st July the Sultan proposes to effect further economies amounting to Rs.25,000 in 1933 mainly by cutting down the civil list (i.e. the salaries of His Highness’s relations) which has hardly been touched by previous retrenchment, other services having already been cut to the bone. These further economies will enable the State to transfer Rs.25,000 to invested reserve in 1933 and Rs.50,000 in 1934, the remaining surpluses being devoted apparently to further redemption of debt. In 1935 when the State loses the arm^ subsidy there will again be a surplus of approximately Rs.74,000 minus Rs.1,00,000, leaving a small deficit of about Rs.^6,000 which may necessitate further economies if the general position still shows no improvement. On the other hand about half the debt will have been liquidated and/ 1212 5000 9.32Wmmmmrnm and the State will have a reserve of Rs.75,000 at the beginning of 1935. Apart from the arms subsidy the State derives by far the greater part of its revenues from 'customs and landing charges' (see p.4) which are no doubt extremely difficult to estimate, but the foregoing figures appear to have been calculated on a very conservative basis. Some improvement in revenue is to be hoped for when the State at last obtains the right to raise its tariff (and it is probable that the negotiations in connexion with thjls will shortly be completed) and the recent reduction in th^ Indian tariff on Muscat dates should also help, so that we may say that if the Sultan really carries out his intention of economising to the extent of Rs.50,000 per annum by cutting down the civil list the position will be satisfactory and it may be possible to start spending something on education again in a few years time. In this connexion it will be seen (P.Z.1445/33) that the severe economies recently undertaken have provoked a certain amount of ill-informed criticism in Arab circles. With regard to last year’s financial working reference is invited to Captain Alban’s comprehensive report (P.Z.1418 - pp.numbered 26-39). The following points are worthy of special notice:- pp.27-28 III - A reduction of over Rs.3 lakhs per annum has been effected in expenditure since 1929; r.z. Uiijt 33 p. 29 :iv p. 30 p. 30 ivi - A great improvement has been made in the assessment of Zakat (facilitated by the State’s road-making programme with the increased control which it renders possible) and collections are proceeding satisfactorily; - There has been a great improvement in the financial administration and methods of the State; - (see also P.Z.1918/33). It is satisfactory that the State will nowPaper. Department, have heen able to pay off the Government of India’s loan, since unlike the State’s other liabilities (mostly debts to local merchants) it bears interest. The Political Resident has suy^psted that official approval should be given to the 1933 budget and the Government of India state that they see no objection to this. The Government of India are of course very closely interested in the financial position of Muscat since the proposed termination of the Arms Subsidy of Rs.1,00,000 in 1935 will presumably depend on the ability of the State to stand the loss. It seems unnecessary for the Secretary of State to sanction the Muscat Budget (approval has previously been given by the Political Resident apparently without reference to the Government of India - see e.g. flag X), but it is just possible from the terms of the Government of India's letter of 23rd February, (P.Z.1418/33) that they expect some reply from us. A draft is accordingly submitted noting that the Government of India see no objection to sanction being given. From correspondence just received from India (P.Z.1973/33), it will be seen that Captain Alban is to continue in his present capacity at Muscat at any rate for a year from the date of his return from six months' leave, which he will take as from the end of July^ remaining in Muscat during that month in case of trouble when the economies in the civil list are introduced. This is satisfactory and it will no longer be necessary to approach Captain Alban's brother with a view to his succeeding Captain Alban at Muscat (see correspondence at P.Z.]Things are better than they might be # #ut j expenditure has been cut to the bone, and in the interests of giving the new Sultan a good start (he is shaping very well at the moment), and of avoiding criticism - damaging to His Majesty's Government as well as to His Highness - on the ground that nation-building services such as education have been retrenched, and that, retrenchment generally has been pushed unduly fc£:,£l cannot help fee ling (parti cularly in the light of Colonel Fowle's remarks on P.Z.1445 ) that there is a strong case, despite existing financial stringency , for the further extension, say for a year or two at least after 1935, of the Arms Traffic Subsidy unless in the meantime there is a very definite improvement in the financial condition of the State. (We may, as Mr.Crombie points out, benefit by the modification of the tariff, once that goes through, and we are now contemplating the institution of landing fees, payable to the Muscat Government, and of the payment of an annual rent &amp;.c. by Imperial Airways, in respect of the Gwadur air facilities - this may prove an expanding source of revenue though it is never likely to be considerable). But it would be a false economy, particularly if the Ruler continues to shape w r ell, to risk a financial collapse, the discredit and the onus of dealing with which would fall on us, if the risk can be reduced by a short further extension of the subsidy The question of the future of the subsidy can be discussed with Colonel Fowle on his forthcoming visit, and in the light of such discussion tentative soundings can, if necessary, be taken of the Government of India.

The distortions aBout the 'ship', and the 'date trees', the Sultan has doubtless dealt; with in • his communication to the Editor. The closing down of the school, however, is quite true, though o? course not for the reasons given, and was the Sultan’s own suggestion • (vide paragraph 3,2 of Political Agent, Muscat’s letter No. 17/17/681 of 13th June 1932 sent under my letter No. 541-3 of 5th August 1932).

But half-way through the year, from July 1st, further economies, details of which will oe furnished by the aultan, will be enforced which wlHiring in by the end of the year another &amp;&amp;• 25,000 (paragraph 5 of the budget statement). The total credit balance at the end of 1933 will therefore be m. 4&lt;4,750. Of this sum 25,000 will be funded, while its. 23,750 will presum ably oe set aside for paying off debts. 6. It is assumed (paragraph 4 of budget statement) that the year 1934 will close with a balance of about &amp;»• 74,000 odd, l.e. *kS. 23,750 (similar to the balance for 1933), and hs. 50,000 the balance aoc^ed from the special economies over a whole year. Of the hs. 74,000, Its. 23,750 will presumably be spent in further liquidation of the debts, and iis* 50,000 will be funded, giving atotal Investment reserve of Its. 75,000 At toe oeginning of 1925 (paragraph 5 of budget statement). 7. JKarlf in 1955 (AprllJ tfee Si^ate will lose tbe arms be^eidjr ot r*&gt;* 1,00,000, uut enulubive jt tue invest' ment reserve of B». 76,000 (assuming that the working expenditure and revenue for that year will oe approximate ly the same as for 1932-55-34) will have a balance at the end of the year of about ids. 74,000, i.e. approximately .Ks. 24,000 (similar to the balance for 1934) and i*ts. 50,000 the balance accrued from the special economies over the year, leaving a debit balance of 26,000 to be made up from other sources (paragraph 6 of budget statement)• 6. There is of course much tnat is necessarily hypothetical in Captain Mban* i forecast of what the financial situation of the dtate will be some three ye&amp;rc hence, but as in that period the ^tate is faced with the' loss of (what to it) is a very large source of revenue, the Arms subsidy, some sort of forecast had to be attempt ed. The principal feature of the budget statement is the institution of the special economies from 1st July (paragraph 6 of statement). The decision of His Highness to introduce these economies half-way througn the year instead of now is certainly peoullar, but - from the Sultan*s point of view - there is good reason f&gt;r it. These economies will be mate from the Civil List, i.e. cuts in the allowances of the Boyal family, and by the 1st July His Highness will not be in luso&amp;t to face his disgruntled relatives, as he is proceeding to an outlyin and - after the monsoon breaks - inaccessible part of his/his doainloos - i)hotar 9 for the summer. By the ti^us he returns at tue ena of August or so the family storm will have seated. His Highness pursued the same tactics last year by being absent in India when the economies reported in my letter No. &amp;4i*^ of bth August last vere effected. I cannot say that Z.i&amp;,tHlgbness f tactics are heroic, but they are doubtless what any peace-loving man would adopt under similar circumstances, more especially since - as His Highness confided once to me in a moment of confidence - it is the women folk amongst his relatives that he especially fears. His mother indeed, wife of the ex-aultan .iaiyid Talmur, is a most formidable old lady, and X have a suspicion that oalyld X&amp;imur*s abdication was perhaps as much due to his desire to get away from her as from Muscat and its responsibilities. 9. the idea of the Investment reserve to be built up by the special economies is sound enough in itself, provided that His Highness stands firm by these economies being actually made from the Civil List, and not from the general administration which - as Captain Alban points out (paragraph b of the Budget statement) has already been cut to the bone. I will procure from His Highness, before he goes into his summer retreat, details of the proposed economies. Captain Alban's report on the Muscat Btate financial year 1932 contains much interesting matter which it must have taken much laboug to collect. The 1933 budget Itself seems to me to meet the exigencies of the financial situation, and should - I suggest - be given our official approval. Doubtless there are details in it at which a financial purist might cavil, but I venture to quote the con cluding sentence of my report (written as lolltical Agent,/Agent, KuacatJ on tbo finances of the Kgs cat State, Ko. 0-288 of lOtU Deoe^Oer 1931, whloh 1 think contains the principles by ehioh «e Bight be guided In viewing the affairs of that state (as indeed theaffairs of the other Arab states of the Persian Culf), politioal as well as ^flnanoiali 'Se are not dealing with a part of British ^ndia, we are not even dealing with an Indian State, our donoern is with an independent Arabian sultanate whose stability for various reasons, political and strategical.

The Financial Adviser to theState has submitted explanatory notes and details on the new budget together with a very full report of affairs affecting the State’s revenues during the financial year of 1932. Little co.ament is called for, the present budget being based on no exuberant anticipations of bumper revenues for 1933. The item under expenditure w Light House Guards' seems one that should not be borne by the State, but by the Government Department concerned. It is not traceable under what circum stances the State has been called upon to bear this expenditure. State sailing craft would certainly carry on as of old whether the lighthouse existed or not. Should further economies be called for during 1933 it would certainly appear from the detailed list of expenditure that there is ample room for retrenchment under the head 'Civil List - Allowances to the Ruling Family'. Many of these allowances are extravagantly generous and although His Highness is loathe to reduce any of them at present it would seem that the time is not far distant when he will have to grasp the nettle firmly and effect economies in this direc tion also.

The year 19' 2 has “been an extremely unsettled one from a financial point of view. \t the close of the financial year 1931, after an unprecedented slump in the prices of commodities it was though t'r at oottom had 'been touched and that in the coming year, even if conditions did not improve they would not at least deter* iorate tuch further. 3. On this assumption, therefore, the budget estimate of revenue for 19ZZ was based on the actual receipts of the previous year, less 50,000 to offset any other possible drop in receipts. 4. The advent of the year 193i* was wait fad with interest and when the month of January brought in receipts exceeding those of the corresponding period for the two preceding years it was hoped that the worst of the depression was passed. February and ifarah while not so good, were at least equal to the previous year. 5. how according to all precedent the next two months of the year i.e. April and May should have been much more pros* porous owing to the arrival from abroad of country craft laden with imports from their last voyage before the monsoon. It is in this period also that large quantities of Kasha i.e. fish manure, are shipped to India and Germany. 6. At the beginning of April, however, as a result of advices received froar Germany, no shipment of Kasha took place to that country. The result of this was an immediate and heavy slump in the market for this article while shipments for Bombay and southern India also declined. 7. A heavy drop in revenue immediately appeared and the Treasury lost nearly Is. 32,000, as compared with the corres ponding period for the previous year, in the month of April8, 1% was now clear that IT the market maintained this attitude until the end or the year the state 9 so far from shottnga surplus 9 would he faced with a defiolt of any thing upto half a lakh of rupees, comprehensive 9, A. scheme of retrenchments and economies was accordingly drawn up, which, in its final form as put up to the Hon •hie the political Resident, Tide i?o. 17/17/661 dated June 15th, 1932, from P.ii., Muscat to p.R. secured a reduction in the state expenditure of about h. 60,000, Theca reductions weie finally brought into force on July 1 uad incorporated in the revised budget for the later half of the year. 10, Kb previously anticipated, the next three months i.e # June, July and August produced some of the poorest revenue figures ever recorded but in September, following on improved conditions in Germany and in Ilndia, the prices of dates and Kasha began to show an upward tendency with the result that figures for the later months of the year hove shown a very decided improvement over those of the preceding year and it is now certain that the State will have a satisfactory balance over te, 40,000 to carry forward into 1933* II. Retrenchments and Koonomles, 11, The economies effected in 1932 (para 9 above) lay more in the direction of closing down departments not absolutely essential, abolition of superfluous or redundant posts and the cutting down of allowances,rent, ect, Except for a few instances no general retrenchment of salaries on a percentage basis was carried out, this ground having been sufficiently covered during the previous year. The only expenditure head which had escaped all but an insignificant cut being the civil list, 12, previous retrenchments had been as fellows .Defence, 16 % reduction in salaries and re-organisation, Oustoms , 10 # reduction in salaries Other departments 7 i reduction in salaries Civil List , 5 % reduction in allowances for those drawing Is* 100 per mensem or over.13 # In addition to these genetfral reductions a continuous process of pruning and weeding out superfluous posts and other items of expenditures had been going on ^while new rates of pay at the rate of ls # 20 per mensem were Introduced for the Sepoys of the Lewy Corps in place of the former rate of Ite. *6. To Illustrate the effect of these various economies a comparison between the expenditures of the principal departments in 1929 and that of the same departments In 1933 as given below:* Budget Heads 1929 1933.

The position of the state as regards trade is shown by the following figures:- Imports. exports. Adverse trade balance. 1930- 31 £. 2,32,478 £. 1,32,797 £. 1,49,681 1931- 32 £. 2,49,141 £. 1,13,822 £. 1,35,319 Decrease £. 33,337 fi. 18,975 £. 14,362 The situation, therffore, is that a heavy drop both in imports and exports has taken place this year as compared with the last. In addiction to thls f the adverse trade balance stands at the very high figures of £. l t 49 f 681 for 1930-31 and £• l t 35 f 319 for 193l-32 f it ls 9 however f encouraging to note that this adverse balance has decreased by £.14 9 362. Ho satisfactory explanation is forthcoming as to where these large amounts are obtained from, practically no export Aakes place over the land frontier, and it can only be assumed that these4 * &gt;9 r i ® these large sums of money constitute expenditure out of capital 8aT iags amassed dinring the prosperous flays of the Arms Traffic and the War. If this is so then the value of imports will continue to decline, even as it is now doing, until it finds its natural level in relation to the exports. 16. The increase or decrease in the value of the principal articles of import in the year 1931-S&amp; as compared with the previous year are shown in the Appendix I attached. A net decrease of 4,88,190 is shown. In Appendix n will he found the corresponding figures for the principal articles of export during the last two years. Here again a decrease of h. Si,06,707 will he noticed. IV. Zakat. 16. During the spring and early summer of this year a compre* hensive assessgment of Zakat was carried/along nearly the whofe Batinah Coast, out of the nine districts lying between Xuscat and rurair, seven were assessed in great detail, garden by garden and the revenue records thus compiled are the basis of the present year f s demand, previous to this, Zakat had been imposed on communities and individuals at odd times and under varying circuit* stances. There was no regular system and no regular rate of incidence in relation to value of crops or market prices. As a result of this, powerful communities were paying noMal sums of akat such as 3 ^. 50 when under the assessment the Zakat on their properties amounted to /. 2,000 or more. Conversely individual were found paying as much as is. 100 per annum the Zakat whose properties were found on assessment to be liable to about fe. 20 per annum. The collections, after some preliminary discontent unavoid- able in any new undertaking of this sort, are proceeding satis* faotorily.Y. prtTloua T^ara. 17.

Based on 10 months* actual receipts and 2 months estimated, figure may he exceeded hut will not he less than shown. 18. Referring to the above table the estimates frem previous to 1951 appear to have been compiled without paying attention to the actual amounts received and the result of this was, that between 1926 and 1951 the State lost nearly Is. 6,00,000 through excess expenditure. The loss was also partly due to no regular accounts having been kept during this period of either revenue or expenditure and it has not been possible for this reason to give figures previous to 1951 with absolute acctrcaoy. YI. Public Debt. 19. The amount of public debt including Government of India Loan, on 31st of December of the years 1929,1930,1931 and 1932 was as under: j 1929. k. 1,50,272 1930 2,02,704 1931. 1,99,390 1932. 1,53,204 20. The year will thus close with a decrease of k. 46,186 in6 ^ 21 0 in the public debt. The amount will be still further reduced by payment of the final instalment amounting to fc, kZ $ 000 of the Government of India Lean In the first weelc of January, 1933 and the scaling down, by mutual agreement of debts due to private individuals. YII, summary £1* The balance on the year *8 working will be more than fe. 16,000, this plus an accrued sating of fc. 24,000 will give an opening balance of more than Is. 40,000 for the year 1933.(para 10 22. The outstanding debts amount to about fc. 1,60,000 (para 19), Those due to Government of India, amounting to about Es. 23,000, will be paid off early in 1933 and those due to merchants as funds permit after scaling down (para 20). Till. Appcn&amp;loee 23. Appendix I is a comparative table showing the value of the principal articles of Import In the years 1930-31 A 1931-32 together with the net Increases or decreases (para 15). 24. Appendix II gives the corresponding export figures for the above two years (para 15). 26. Appendix III shows the average wholesale prices prevailing in united Kingdom, Germany and India during previous years and from January to August, 1932. 26. The prices for the year 1931, it will be noted, show a heavy slump compared with those of preceding years (para 2). The prices for January, Kebru&amp;ry and March, 1932 are even, with a downward tendency (para 4). 27. Beginning from April a further marked drop in prices is apparent in all three countries (paras 6 A 6) and this continues until August when a slight upward movement was recorded in the United Kingdom and British India (para 10). 28. The month of September shownjf a further substantial rise in the united Kingdom prices. 29. Referring to part 7 (para 17) which gives revenue estimates and receipts for previous years it will be seen that the heaviestheaviest drops in revenue vere in 1930,1931 and 193fc. Turning to the table pT prices (App, III) we see that In 1930 the drop In prices was 9 united Kingdom 17 polnts f Germany 12.6 and India 24 points. 30. In 1931 the drops were united Klnfdom 16.2, Germany 17.5 and British India 21.4. The average drop over the first eight months of the current year is, united Kingdom 1.6, Germany IK), and British India 4 points. 31. The drops recorded in 1930 and 1931 represent a financial catastrophe. The comparatively insignificant fall in prices in 1932 indicates that the bottom of the market has nearly been reached. 32. Later prices for September, potober and November show arv upward tendency of about 2 points, which, taken in conjunction with more favourable reports of Smpire trade, may be taken to mean that prices, for some time to come, will maintain approx* imately their present level. 33. It is probable that the drops recorded in the first eight months of the current year will be recovered and the average prices over the whole year be at least equal to those of 1931. 34. According tc the trend of prices, therefore, it would appear that the revenue for 1932 ought to be eaual to or only slightly below that of 1931. 35. Other considerations, hosever, have affected the trade of Oman in common with that of the rest of the world. Borne of these are as follows:- (ft) The raising of the tariff barriers of India, Persia, America and possibly Zanzibar and last Africa. (b) The impoverishment of the people of Oman as a result of the exceptional severity of conditions in previous years. (o) The bankruptcy and disappearance of any thing up to 50 % of the traders. (d) The excessively reduced circumstances of the survivors.s. e; thu natural avarsIon of tra&amp;ors of sng&amp;glnf In now oommeroial ontorprlao until to the attitude of the m'.rket can he gua^ed with more oartainity.

Appendix it Is a graph showing the trend of values of British and Americal Industrial shares over the eight months period yarch to ootoher, 193a. 57. It will he observed that after slight recovery in March (unra 4), a sudden and heavy drop took place in April and con tinued down to the lowest level of the year in pay. 3a. This is in conformity with our experience in yuscat (paras 6*7). it also agrees with the drop in April prices shown] in para 27. 39. July snots a sharp recovery which has continued through^ August and September (para 27) while October remained steady, m accordance with this, our receipts September onward have shown a decided improvement (para 10). In Appendix 111 also, this dowaward tendency is reflected in the prices ■between April ana August (para Ji7) # 40. in September a general recovery is shown which is continued in October and NoYemtoer (para #8). 41. it should noted that the wholesale prices in Appendix III are those of all coDifliOdities and raw materials while the graph given above represents the avexage Stock Sxoh&amp;uge prices Of 30 British ordinary industrial shares and 60 Amaiican common Stocks. 42, Appendix v is a graph showing the progress, r.rrth by during nonl}h t oT unseat state reveuno/lP^**^ (vide Beport part I).Mr. Walton. The amount required to cover the debit was Rs.48,300. The amount His Highness originally hoped to save was Rs.51,958 (P.2.5508), which would have given a surplus of Rs.3,658. The amount actually saved was Rs.47,240, i.e. Rs.4,718 short of the sum hoped for and Rs. 1,060 short of the sum needed. But Captain Alian says the budget does in fact balance. Where then has the extra Rs.1,060 come from? Comparison of the present figures for receipts with those of the original budget at P.Z.1238 shows an increase under the headings of Passport Fees (Rs.100), Brokerage Tax (Rs.500), Bait-el-Mai (Rs.500) and 'Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous' (Rs.300) with a decrease of Rs.500 for Boat Registration- Total increase of Rs.900. Moreover Captain Allan's figure of Rs.48,300 needed should have been 48,200; tliis is due to the fact that in para.7 of his letter at P.Z.5508 he estimated the total revenue at the rough figure of Rs.6,52,000 instead of 6,52,100. Rs./Rs,1,000 are thus accounted for. I have failed to discover where Captain Aljan has got the remaining Rs.60 from. A. F.M. 10 / 11 .x Ito. 17/17/ f?2 cr 193*.

As you are aware the Muscat State has been hard hit by the general trade depression, and a half-yearly adjustment of the State Budget was rendered necessary owing to a serious drop in the general revenue (vide my letter lfo.54l-S of the 5th August 19 32). Horeover in little more than two years from now •fr^ the State will dose the Arms Traffic subsidy of Rs« 1*00,000 (vide Government of inuia Express xett^r Ao .f. xol-N/32 of 3 )th June 19 32}* If tne State therefore is to weather the depression, almost literally every rupee’s increase in its revenue is of consequence. The prospect therefore of raising more revenue from the date districts of the Batirah and Shiiaaliyeh is an important factor in the finance of the State. 3* *'flien Captain Alban therefore suggested to me his scheme for a proper assessment of the districts in question, I concurred provided that it could be carried out in such a way that trouble naa not created amongst the tribes concerned, and XTiriher-tha t when the assessment had been completed it should ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S 1 only Letter No 1125 m. Dated 8 SEP 1932 R * w|v - '26 SEP. i932only be imposed on the same terms; absence of tribal friction. Captain Alban agreed wl th my views and proceeded to make the a seessment. 4. It appears from Captain Alban* s report that the assessment hag been successfully carried out without serious friction. It remains for the assessment to be imposed under the same conditions. 5. In effecting the assessment, the greater part of which ^s done under his personal supervision before he left Muscat for Karachi, Captain Alban has done good work under trying conditions. The hot weather is far from being an ideal time for revenue assessment in Oman, which of course is entirely lacking in the amenities of dak bungalows, restnouses, and so forth, which exist in India.

While the year 19 32 has been marked by falling revenues in all directions it is satisfactory to be able to report that in consequence of the new assessment of aakat revenue in a more up to date manner a substantial increase in receipts is promised under this heading, 2. The Batinah and dhimaliyeh coasts comprise the largest stretch of continuous date cultivation in the world. The plantations extend in almost unbroken regularity for close on 200 miles. Hume roue varieties of dates and other trees are found, by far the most popular of which is the Batni date, which, though inferior in quality, has the advantage of being able to ripen in spite of the extfeseive humidity of the sea coast. Hext to the Batni date comes the ♦Jyfebsili*, which when boiled and dried is known as the ’Bisr* and is largely exported to India for consumption at marriage feasts and other entertainments* 3. The Batinah coast is by ancient custom, divided into 9 ♦Walayats' or districts. These, commencing from the town of Muscat itself are Sib, Birkah, Jfcsnaah, Suwaiq, Khaboorah, Saham, Sohar, Liwa and Shimaliyeh. Previous to this year four of these 9 districts have been paying a more or less adequate ^akat. These were Birkah, Saham, Sohar and Liwa. Of the remaining 5 districts 3 i.e. sib, Khaboorah and Shimaliyeh were paying purely nominal sums and the last two Suwaiq and Masnaah paid nothing at all.4. This year out of the total 9 districts seven i.e* Sib t Birkah» Khaboorah, saham, Sohar* Liwa and Shiznaliyeh have been fully assessed to 3ikat revenue while the two districts, ifesnaah and Suwaiq, which have never yet paid Zakat revenue have been left out. 5. Jo serious opposition other than the usual grumbles of the tax payer was met with except in the case of one or two small villages where the assessing party were refused entrance by the Sheikhs. These difficulties, however, were all settled amicably ag they arose and rny latest information shows that work in the district is progressing smoothly. Capts in.

Fov/le, Political Agent &amp; H-B.M* s Consul, Muscat. To The Hon'Ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Muscat State Revised Budget for 1932 . Sir, I have the honour to refer to paragraph 4 of my memorandum Mo.C/97 of 5th May 1932, and to add that the question of further economies in the Budget of the Muscat State for this j/ear has been under the close consideration of His Highness the Sultan, Captain Alban, the financial Adviser and myself. 2. The final paragraph of my letter Ho.C/283 of X) th December 1931, in which I summed up my comments on the Budget for this year, concluded with the recommendation that - subject to any remarks which Captain Alban had to make (he had then not taken up his duties as financial i Adviser) - we mignt give our approval to the Budget, a copy of my letter was given to Captain Alban on arrival, and he concurred in my recommendation. 3. In making up the Budget His Highness and his Accountant General had based their estimate of Revenue on the receipt# for 1931, allowing for a drop in 1932 of about Es.50,000. The year 1931 was in itself a bad y ^ r 9 in fact the worst from the Revenue point of view since2- a regular Budget was introduced about 12 years ago* It was therefore reasonably hoped that the Budget estimate of receipts was a safe one* Unfortunately this has not been the case, and from the experience gained in the first half year Captain Alban estimates that there will be a drop in receipts (on tne Budget estimate) in Customs dues of up to Es*50,000* Captain Alban bases his estimate on the factors enumerated in the next paragraph* 4. (a) Serious decrease in imports specially of rice, wet • dates, sugar and coffee as compared with the corres -ponding period of i93i* (b) Jfall in prices of the above articles. (c) Decrease in exports of dry and wet dates and dried and salted fish* (d) Since March last almost total cessation of the iatrg large export of Kasha i.e. fish manure and a drop of no less than from $ 120 to $ 30 per Banar of the small amount that continue to be exported. (e) Drop in price of dates (dry and wet produced in the Muscat State and Oman* (f) In all previous years from January to July inclus ive the months of April and May have shown very substantially higher revenue returns than the other months of the same period. This year, however, no such increase has been recorded and a drop of £s*3i,900 revenue, as compared with the corresponding months of the last year, has occurred. (g) The last 5 months of the year usually show increase ed revenue figures. Owing however to the serious % drop in the price o^f dates and the cessation of export of Kasha (see d above), we are not ’warranted in anticipating any such increase during the latter part of the present year. (h) Receipts for the first 5 months of the year totally1,700 &gt; which, sum includes comparatively good revenues of the months of January, February and March i.e* before the complete slump in price and export of Kasha, It is not safe therefore under these circumstances to assume a higher total reve nue for the remaining months of the year tnan Ks*210,000, or a total Customs revenue for the year ±952 of about 400,000 i.e* ^*50,000 less tnan the last y«ar. 5. I discussed the matter with Captain iilban, when His Highness - to whom of course Captain Alban had first communicated his apprehensions - approached me I suggested tnat the first thing to do wag for H±s Highness to be satis fied that the deficit estimate of his Financial Adviser was correct* If Captain Alban could convince him that his esti mate was correct we would have to consider how the deficit was to be met. If Captain Alban could not convince him tnen we would reconsider the matter, 6. His Hignness after a detailed examination of the estimate - he has a distinct flair for figures and finance - informed me that it would certainly be prudent to allow for the drop prognosticated by Captain Alban. The latter officer and myself then went in to details and produced for His Highness’s consideration a number of economies which, by producing more than the sum required, gave His Highness a choice as to which proposals he would adopt. Various dis cussions followed between His Highness, Captain Alban and myself and finally His Highness approved of the economies given in paragraph 8. 7. The situation briefly is as follows:- Budget ±952* Revenue from all sources was estimate at iw,7(k ,000 (Customs Revenue with Landing charges was estimated at ls.450,000)-4- Expenditure under all heads (not including repayment of debts) was estimated at_ Balance credit i i»676.300 ** ao ^ boo But Financial Adviser estimates a fall in Customs Revenue of Ss*50 ,000. Therefore Revenue from all sources will he Rs^G^XOCK) As pointed out in paragraph 5 of my letter Kb•0/283 quoted above the late Sultan's allowance of Rs.2000 per month or Rs.24000 per annum was not included in the Budge t, TThen this is allowed lor the total expenditure comes to Balance debit A; .700,300 ' 48,300 v 8. His Highness's proposals to cover this deficit are as follows:- 1 • j^purit^su rrenuered ,fro m Bu dget Estimates Rs* 21,00 0 Public Works Department ii3.14,000 Furniture •* 1,000 Contingencies * 1,000 defence ' 5,000.

Reductions. 2* Education . His Highness proposes to close down the school altogether until better times. The present building io on hire and unsatisfactory. The school is no*, closed lor the summer holidays, the masters have left on vacation, aru. so the moment for this economy is a suitable one. Excluding the cost of a new school which His Highness estimates at about Rs.4,000 the saving for the whole year-5- IS would 'be Rs» 14,000 minus $#4,000 * Ss. 10,000# On the half year the saving will therefore he 5,000 (3) Payment of out stations staff in Dollars* ^11 the staff outside Ifuscat, who are already not paid in dollars, will he paid in dollars at the rate of 1 £ per rupee.

It may he noted that it appears possible- 6 - that the *£1 Saihi 1 * is riot sea-worthy. His Highness has asked die to get an opinion on this point from the Naval authorities in the Persian Gulf, if they will he so kind as to inspect her. The proposal is that the *al Saidi H should he laid up for the remaining half year from which a saving can he made of 10,000 (11) Saving on dap ta in ^lhan*£ VaJ . Saving on Captain ^Ihan's pay for 2 months when he acts as Political Ag^Sjt 3,000 ( 12 ) Niscellaneous. This is made up of reduction in the Civil List of Eation and Horse allowances, in the number of warders and some other items 3 . 0 j 2 51,958 This is nearly Ks.4Q00/- more than the deficit anticipated hy the financial adviser. The clesing credit balance in 1931 was about Rs*42,8Q0 • This was ear-marked for the repayment of debts, and after certain of these have been paid off, or partially paid off, there remains a balance of about Rs.23,000/-. The most urgent debt which His Highness wishes to pay ofi as soon as possible is the balance of the Government of India Loan of Rs.21,000/-. If the financial situation at the end of the year is as apprehended then advantage can be taken of the moratorium granted by the Government of India (vide correspondence ending with Foreign and Political Department corrigendum NodF.35-N/31 dated 5-8-31) and payment deferred, and the amount used as exigencies demand. It things are better than anticipated it can be used to liquidate the debt.10, It is unfortunate that the Budget has had to he modified, hut as explained in paragraph 3 above vvhen it - the Budget - was Ciade up there was every prospect that it would he adequate to carry the State over the year. It is only an unprecedented C^op in trade, which could not he .foreseen, that has thrown out the calculation on which the Budget was made. Muscat has in fact suffered from the same general causes which have recently forced other, and much more important Governments, Such as the Indian and British, to take emergency measures to balance their Budgets 11 . ^ith regard to the economies themselves; His Highness frankly informed me that in view of the fact that in composing the Budget he had already made one series of •cuts' - in making these new ones he had taken the line of least resistance, ^mongst other possible •cuts', for instance, which Captain ..xlhan and I had put up for His Highness's consideration(para 6 ) was salaries in the Civil List. Commenting on this proposal His Highness did not attempt to defend the large expenditure under this head, hut stated that if he made 'cuts' in this and any of his uncles - who are among the beneficiaries - proved obstreperous, he would have ,to take strong measures against them. (ifom where we/were sitting the Stat Prison of Jalali could he seen and His Highness's eye wandered in thct direction.) He was naturally averse to taking drastic actiep. I replied, which was g.uite true, that I fully sympathised with his view r s, and that it was for Captain alban and myself to put up proposals to cover the deficit, ind for him to choose whichever ol the proposals he thought oest. His Highness appeared pleased at this interpretation of our attitude, and went on to say th^t in November or December, when the 1933 Budget was being prepared, he would be in a stronger position to make further cuts if necessary. 12 . His Highness's proposals to cover the deficit appear- 8 - v to me the best under the ciroumstances, and from his point of view as IT inuncial Adviser * Cl ap tain ^Ihan) is satisfied with them. I trust they have your approval ? It is pro- • posed that they come intlfb force with effect from the 1st July, and I would have liked to have given you longer time for consideration. The various discussions, however, 'between Eis Highness, Captain Alban and myself have taken time, and I was anxious not to f rush* His Highness in any way.

Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. Colonel Eiscoe's despatch is interesting. His proposals regarding the Levy Corps,which have been accepted by the Government of India are: SEEN POLITICAL COMM1TTEB. (1) that the strength of the Corps should be maintained at 150, in soite of the orders in the Government of India's Express letter of 15th May, 1931/* (P.Z.3378/31) directing that vacancies arising in the Corps should remain unfilled provided that its strength was not reduced below 100 ; (2) that the basic pay of the Sepoy should be reduced to 20 rupees per mensem. 2 4 AUG 195Z With regard to the first proposal, it is pointed out that the finances of the Muscat State Previous Papers:— k ave now been on a tolerably satisfactory footing so that it can afford to maintain the Corps at a strength of 150, which was considered by Colonel Eiscoe and local officers to be the minimumminimum number that is of any practical military value. With regard to the second proposal, tne basic pay of the Sepoy was originally 30 rupees from which it was reduced to 25 rapees in June, 1931. Colonel Biscoe realised that a further reduction to 20 rupees was a drastic cut; but there are certain factors which seem to justify the arrangement. Owing to the deplorable economic conditions in the Persian Gulf area, recruits are now readily available at the new rates of pay and it is not considered that the reduction will lead to serious discontent or loss of efficiency: also the cut is to a certain extent mitigated by the fall in the cost of living: while thirdly, the Muscat State has to face the possible loss of the Arms Traffic Subsidy of one lakh a year in three years- time (see P.Z.1999/32) so that it is essential to take measures to effect economies and increase its revenues. As regards the details of the administration of the Corps, Colonel Biscoe considered that these could be left to the discretion of the Sultan whose interest in the Corps it is most desirable to encourage Finally, it is noted that the arrangement by which the posts of Commandant of the Corps and Financial Adviser of the State are held by one officer, Captain Alban, is working satisfactorily^ l?

I would tender my sincere apologies for my failure to re^ly to this letter earlier. I can but plead that I have been almost continuously on tour throughout the past cold weather and have had many pre-occupations, and the matter was therefore over looked. Moreover various causes combined to divest the question of the Levy Corps of some of the impor tance that it had previously assumed. I regret to say that I also overlooked the orders contained in Government of India f s Bxpress Letter No.F.19-N/31 of ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S I* Lotter No the 15 th May 1931, in which it ms directed that until further orders vacancies arising in the Levy Corps should remain untilled provided the strength of the Corps was not reduced below? 100. this connection, however, I would invite a reference to Colonel Fowle # s despatch N 0.487-S o f ^Ist August 1951, paragraphs 13 and 17, in which he HOI reported that some men had been recruited to replace up H ticted 21 o1932 9asualties and the strength of the Corps brought Receive P AUG. .j3? ^ to^ to about 130 • Tiie Government of India have been informed, therefore, that some recruitment was going on ana that the possibility of bringing the Corps up to its normal strength of 150 was under consiaera- tion. By the end of the year the financial position of the State had considerably improved owing to various measures of economy that had been effected, and the State had succeeded in repaying to the Government of Inaia its instalment of rts.43,000, and had a balance of about tfe.30,000 in the Treasury, Bor the current year provision was accordingly made in the budget for the Corps to be brought up to its • normal strength of 150 and steps have now been tamen to enlist the additional men reciuired, In ilis latter No*638-S of 2nd October 1931, the Officiating political Resident submitted very detailed proposals, regarding the future composition and rates oi pay of the Corps* Into these details I do not thin*, it is necessary to follow him, ©or would it seem necessary to trouble the Government of India with the minor details of administration. Last year special attention was attracted to the administ ration of the Corps by three causes; firstly, itwas made a test case by the late Financial Adviser; secondly, the financial position of the State was precarious and measures of economy essential, and thridly, irregularities had been discovered on the part oi the late Commandant in the administration of the Corps and investigation was ordered. The circum stances have now changed; the linances of the State have been put on a tolerably satisfactory footing and the irregularities discovered have been eliminated. Ihe State can now aiiora to maintain the Corps at its proper strength of 150, and this is considered by mysell and the local olficers the minimum number that is of any practical military value. I trust there-thereiore tiie Gk&gt;vermiient ol India will be pleased to approve of tiie dorps being maintained at this figure« 5. ‘Now, as regards the pay of the Corps. The hasic pay of the s§poy was originally and last June it was reduced to Rs*&lt;i5/~. Suhse^uently Oaptain Alban reported that owing to the acute economic distress prevailing in the Persian Gulf, recruits were forthcoming at Rs.2Q/~ per mensem, and therefore entrants to replace wastage were engaged at this rate.. There are, thereiore, at the present moment, as reported hy Colonel Fowle, two rates of pay prevailing in the Corps, namely, Rs%25/— and ks.20/- for men enlisted since last July. Actually at the present time 94 are in receipt of the old rate of pay and 55 or the new rate. Captain AlDan has now suggested that the basic rate of pay of ail the sepoys should he reduced to 1&amp;.20/- per mensem. They will, of course, get in addition, rations, good-conduct pay, etc. Captain Alhan assures me that this reduction ol pay will not occasion discontent and there will he no breach of contract, since any man unwilling to accept the new rate will he permitted to terminate his contract ana then go. 5. Now, unaer normal conditions 1 would hesitate to recommend so drastic a reduction, hut for two reasons I now support it. Firstly, the economic condition of the papulation in tne Persian Culf is at the present time deplorable ana they are suffering fram from most acute economic distress, many of them being \ on the brinh of starvation, on the Arab side the pearl market, on which the hulk of the populace depends, is lifeless, while prices of such commodities as dates, etc. which they export, have fallen. It is doubtful if this year even 50$ of the pearling boats will be fitted out and proceed to the bamcs. Merchants andand naKhudas have not the capital to lit out Doats&gt; while the iormer have many lakhs worth of pearls on their hanas. In consequence unemployment is rife. On the Persian side, owing to the total absence of rain - a fact unprecedented in the memory of the oldest inhabitants, famine conditions prevail over a very large portion of the Persian coastal area, and many Persians are migrating to the arab side to seek employment as porters, labourers, etc., thereby adding to the unemployment already existing. In these circum stances wages in the ordinary labour market have naturally fallen enormously, and men are now obtain able on much lower wages than formerly. Por this reason I agree with Captain ^.Iban in thinking that it is possible to obtain recruits of a satislactory stamp lor the Muscat Levy Corps on a basic pay of Rs.20/- per mensem, ana that the existing members of the Corps will think very seriously before cutting their names f and will accept the cut with a good grace. It must be borne in mind that the cost of living has also fallen considerably. V. Secondly, the Luscat State is confronted with a possibility of the loss of the arms Traffic Subsidy of 1 laxh a year in three years* time - vide foreign and Political Department Express Letter No. n Pi D»Q9l-N/3l of the 21st March 1952 t o His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. In these circumstances it is clear that the State will have to take every possible measure to efiect economies and to'increase its revenues. Should trade revive and wages in the ordinary labour market go up and prices of primary commodities increas, it may be necessary to reconsider the matter, but I thinx that a reduction of the basic pay of the sepoy to Rs.2Q/- per mensem will not at present lead to serious discontent or lack of efficiency, i trust therefore the Government of5 India v/ill “be pleased to approve ol' it 8, as regards the other details ot administ ration I do not think it is necessary to trouble the Government ol* India* and I suomit that they can he left to the discretion of His Highness the Sultan, acting on the advice ol Captain ^Ihan, who, as he combines the posts of Commandant and or i’inancial Adviser, is lively to hold the scales evenly between the necessities of the State and the interests of the Corps. His Highness is well aware that the Government of India attach much importance to the efficiency of the Corps, and that it is always regarded as a matter on which their representatives should be consulted before any material changes are made. 9. Captain alban some time ago submitted some interesting suggestions regarding the manner in which the Corps should be organized and utilised, and prima faci e many of them seem to me to be very sound. Cfrieir practical application, however, will require both time ana the expenditure of some money, and I consider it desirable thao before reporting them to the Government of India the views of His Highness the Sultan should be ascertained regarding them, since they were submitted before His Highness had ascended the throne. I consider it most desirable that every effort should be made to get His Highness to interest himself in the Corps and to feel that they are his troops rather than the forces of the Government of India imposed upon a reluctant State, as did Said Taimur. 1 am therefore instructing the Political Agent to obtain the views of His Highness the Suitan in due course and will then submit a further report to the Government of India.

Although much has been done to improve finances and Sayyid Said is displaying much zeal and energy coming year will be a difficult one. Arab harvest has been bad and 7 increase in Indian Tariff has seriously affected exports. Budget is now being prepared. Alban getting on exceedingly well with Sayyid Said who will certainly need guidance at this juncture and (gr.omitted?

Sir, ' ’ f/ith reference to my letter No. 551-3, dated the 28th August 1931, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a memorandum No. 17/17/1007, dated the ^2nd September 1931 from the Political Agent, Muscat, enclosing tne wording statement of the Muscat State Treasury for the month of August 1931, and to make the following observations. Proportionate figu res. 2. Revenue. The collections in whole rupees to date, Rs. 4,43,813, are short of the budget proportion, Rs.437,600, by n s# 43 , 786 . This does not include the Shumaliyah District collection which has not been made for August but Thich is estimated at Rs. 2,000. If Shumaliyah estimate is included then the total collections would be Rs. 4,43,313 plus Rs. 18,605 plus Rs. 2,000 = Rs. 4,64,418, tfiile the propor tionate figures up to date are Rs. 5,16,26 6, i.e. a suor^^e of Rs. 51,848. 3. Tne State, thecefore, if no further deficits occur, has to make up this sum in the next four months since tne T^scat financial year closes on 31st December 1931. The Political Agent, however, points out that the last 3 months of the year always show heavy receipts. 4. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECr' CT * r '' , G Letter No 354 i ictted 2 9 OCT. 1931 Reoei /oa 1 6 iV 19314. Expenditure, The Shumaliyah expenditure has not been shown for the month under review but the proportionate expenditure against this head is shown as Rs. 22,766, 7/e may therefore allow( say) Rs. 2,850 for August which would bring the total actuals up to Rs, 4,28,330 plus Rs, 17,822 plus Rs. 2,850 Rs.4,49,062. As the proportionate allotment to date, without the Government of India loan, is Rs.4,87,766 (i .e. Rs. 4,65,000 plus Rs. 22,766) a saving is shown in actual expenditure over the proportionate allotment, of Rs. 38,764. In this saving are included, however, various outstanding debts as follows; (a) Rs. 21,358 due to His Highness for undisbursed pay from January to April 1931. During these months the reduction of the sultanas alloviance from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 5,000 was under consideration. His allowance was finally reduced to the latter figure with effect from May. The Political Agent points out that this may not be claimed. (b) Rs. 7,696 on account of palace rations from January to April 1931. I do not know why this has not been paid but presume the amount will have to be met. (c) Rs. 8,088 due to the Royal Indian Marine on account of coal for the State gunboat. The total of these debts comes to Rs. 37,142 and if these were added to the expenditure a total of Rs. 4,86,204, would be obtained vhich is still Rs. 1 ,562 less than the proportionate allotment. 5, For the Government of India loan(vide correspondence ending with my letter No. 487-3» dated the 1st August 1931) the Governaent of India have given a moratorium this year. ItIt appears likely» however» that the State will be able to pay it off. 6# The above shows that as far as proportionate allotments of revenue and expenditure are cone erred the position of the State is satisfactory. Actuals. 7# Taking the Actuals of revenue as compared with Actuals of expenditure the position is as follows: Total revenue to date including the Shumaliyah expectations ••••Rs. 4,64,418. Total expenditure to date including allowance for Shumaliyah................ Rs. 4,4 9 ,062. Surplus... Rs. 15,356 This is satisfactory. 8. With regard to the Political Agent’s suggestion that the previous year’s actuals should be substituted for proportional figures I am of opinion that the proportionate figures are more useful as they facilitate a watch being kept on the financial progress of the State throughout the year. I am, however, asking the Political Agent • if it would not over burden the returns and involve too much labour - to have the previous year’s actuals put in as well. Later on it may be sufficient for these returns to be sent in quarterly, but for the present I feel that it is as well to continue a montnly scrutiny. I have, e tc., Sd. T.G.W.Powle.

To The Hon* ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Bush ire* Memo randum. I forward herewith statements in duplicate showing the Revenue and Expenditure of Muscat State for the period of 8 months ending August 19 31, together with covering memorandum No. C/30/169, dated September 14th 1931 from the Council Muscat Sta te • Revenue. It may be noted that Shumaliyah revenue for August is not yet to hand, but Rs. 2000/- (approximately) is expected which will bring total Shumaliyah collections upto Rs. 20,000/- to date, thus total actuals for 3 months will reach Rs.4,63,813 or about t a lac behind the proportionate figure. This is in order as the last three months of the year always show heavier receipts. In this connection I thinx the proportionate figures are of no assistance in estimating whether the budget will be realized or not, with your permission I will ask the Council to substitute, in future, the actuals of last years collections. It is not known yet what will be the effect of the drop in prices of dates, to guard against a drop in revenue however I have again impressed on the Council the need of strictest economy. EXPENDITURE. Total actuals for 8 months plus Shumaliyah expenditure, not yet received, should equal about 4j* lacs* this is well behind the proportionate expenditure figure, on tne othe rother hand, some fairly heavy expenses in connection with Mr. Hedgcock's passages both from and to England have still to be met. A sum of Rs. 21,358/- is due to His Highness the Sultan for undisbursed pay from January to May, this, however may not be claimed, Rs. 7,696/- on account of palace rations from January 1931 to April 1931 is due and the Royal Indian Marine will no doubt claim shortly the sum of Rs. 8088/- due for coal. However, even if all these items had been disbursed actual expenditure would still be below the proportionate figure, while in the next 4 months, a saving of about Rs. 12,000/- on the Levy Corps is anticipated. The Council have assured me that any excesses over budget allotments will be adjusted by re-appropriations and will not swell the total. Sd.

Muscat State Finances. Sir, I have the honour to refer to Foreign and Political Department letter Ho. 3^-i!/31, dated the 14th September 1931 2. My views on question (a) have already been submitted in my letter No. 623-S, dated the 23rd September 1931. 3. As regards ( b) a comparison of the budget estimate for 1930( forwarded under Colonel Biscoe^ letter No. H2, dated 16th .January 1930) and for 193l( forwsrded under my letter No. 551-S, dated the 25th August 1931) shows that certain reductions - especially in the number and pay of personnel - have been made since the despatch of Colonel Biscoe's letter No. 99-S&gt; dated the 5th May 1931 referred to, though their effect is offset by the outstanding bill for coal, amounting to Rs. 11,000, figuring in the budget for 19 31. 4. As the *A1 Said* is an expensive vessel to maintain I instructed the Political Agent to suggest to the Council of Ministers that the vessel should be replaced by a motor dhow* whose cost of maintenance would be much less. The Council, however, are averse to making the change on the groundground that the Muscat State has maintained some sort of a steamer for inany years past and that its substitution by a motor dhow would not be in consonance with the dignity of the state or of its Ruler# 5. An alternative would be to dispose of the ’A1 Said’ and replace it with another steamer whose maintenance would cost less. The f Al Said’ however, is unlikely, particularly at the present moment, to find ready sale and would have to be disposed of at a considerable loss. The adoption of this alternative therefore is not feasible at present. I have, e tc., 3d.

Thus for the two appointments together the State has to pa/ an annual sum of Rs.37,000, which, considering the present financial condition of the State, is a comparative!/ large item in its budget. I am not of opinion, however, that - if it can be avoided - both these posts should oe abolished at present. The State is now passing through a severe financial stringenc/, and the Lev/ Rs. 1,425- 0- 0. 17,100- 0- 0. Rs • 540- 0- 0 Rs.17,640- 0- 0 Rs.17,600/- has in consequence been subjected to various economies, including a drastic cut in trie pa/ of the men. The problem of how the Corps is to be kept contented, efficient and adequate!/ armed and ammunitioned under these new and diiiicult conditions needs the personal attention of a British Officer, as do the financial affairs of the State. I thinic, however, that the two posts might be combined, provided a suitable officer can be found to ‘double the parts', and in this connection would draw attention to Colonel Biscoe* s letter Ho.29Q-S of 25th Ma/ 1931 , in which he suggested Captain Alban could do this successful!/. This measure could be regarded as a temporal/ expedient to get the State through the adverse conditions in front of it during the next /ear or so. At the end of the period, sa/, about October 1932, it is to be hoped that the State will have reached a more prosperous level, and that the Lev/ willwill have thoroughly shaken down to its new conditions. The position could then be reviewed afresh, and it i&amp;ight be found possible to do without a British officer at all. 6. If Government were to accept this proposal then 1 suggest that Captain Alfcan should receive Grade pay ... ... Rs • 750 Overseas Pay .. ... Rs • 150 Allowance as Commandant Rs • 200 Allowance as Financial ) Adviser ) Rs • 200 Rs • 1500 Pension contribution from the State at would come to Hs. per mensem, and passage contribution to Rs. 50/** per mensem, which would bring the total cost of Captain Alban to the State to Rs• 1,675/- per mensem and Rs. 20,100/- per annum or Rs. 700/- more per annum than the last Commandant. On the other hand the annual cost of the financial Adviser, i.e. Rs. 17,600/- would be saved. 7. The political aspect of a British officer in command of the Levy must also be considered. The main object of the Levy is defence against the Omani tribes ol the interior, and there is no doubt that the presence of a British officer out at Bait-ul-Falag, the Legy Headquarters, as a sign manual that the British Government takes an active interest in the defence of the State, has a good effect. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, So/- T.C. Fowle Ma j or. Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Confiden tial. Ho.638.S of 19 31. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General. Bush ire, the 2nd October 19 31. from The Hon 1 'ble ilajor T. C. W. Bowie, C.B.Ji. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf To The foreign Secretary to the Government of India, S I M L A. I* £ tne 1st August 19 31, I have the honour to state that I have received a reply from the Political Agent, Muscat to the queries referred to in paragraph 21 of my letter. 2. Owing to the acute financial stringency in the State drastic economies have been made in the Levy as detailed in my letter quoted above. These economies must continue until the State sees more prosperous days, ajut economies which are practicable for a temporary period, partxcularly in regard to the maintenance of an armed lorce, may not be possible as a permanency. The question therefore which has to be decided is how much of these economies can stand as a permanent measure? Once this question has been answered a definite Levy budget can be laid down which the State will be expected to meet to tne extent that its finances permit. I explained this aspect of the case to Caotain Alban and asked him to give his views accordingly. To take the various items in the Levy budget one by one. Object, strength and composition of the Corps. These points have already been submitted to GovernmentGovernment, and have received their approval vide Colonel Biscoe’s letter Ho, 83-T of 27th November 19 30, and Foreign and Political Departments letter Bo, F. 19~N/31 dated 9th Jlarch 19 31, mentioned in paragraph 11 of my letter quoted above* 4. Present strength of Corps * (Paragraph 13 of my letter)* Captain Alban reports that the Council of Ministers are definitely opposed to any increase in expenditure during the currency of the present budget. I quite agree with their views, and as Government contemplate that for a time the Levy should be under strength, we may take it that it will remain at its present numbers at all events to the end of the year. 5* Headquarters Staff* (Paragraph 14 of my letter). \3lith regard to the British Commandant please see my letter Bo. 623-S of 23rd September 1931. With regard to the Indian Officers Captain Alfean agrees with me that the number should be kept at three “at present'*. I do not see how the Corps can do with less, and it does not need more, so I think we may take it that the number will remain permanently at three. 6. Bon Commissioned Of fleers. (.Paragraph 15 of my letter). Captain Alban is of opinion that the new scale of Non-Commissioned Officers, which is based on the same proportion as in the Indian Army, is sufficient for the Corps as a permanent measure© I concur. 7. Followers * (Paragraph 16 of my letter). Captain Alban says; 'As long as the Corps retains its present formation, the number of followers will be adequate. If a large detachment is kept for a long period in an out- station it may be necessary to engage an extra Bhisti temporarily’ 1 . That is to say that the present scale of followers is adequate for the needs of the Corps. I agree. 8. Pay . (Paragraph 17 of my letter)-y (a; With regard to the pay of the Commanaant. If a separate CoumancLant is appointed then Captain Alban is of opinion, lor various reasons, that “second Army officers do not meet the requirements of the StateHe would appear to favour an officer not actually in Government service, but with an experience of other Arab countries, and suggests a scale of pay similar to that drawn by Captain Parke, Commanaant of Police at Bahrein. While, however, the suggestion, contained in my letter Ho. 623-S of 23rd Septemoei i^3i (which personally I think is the most suitable, taking a.11 the circumstances into consideration), that an economy might be effected by one officer, Captain Alban, hold ing both the posts of Commandant and that of Financial Adviserj is under the consideration of Government, it is hardly worth while entering into the pros and cons of other schemes. (b) Pay of Hon Commissioned Officers and rank and file. The reduction in the pay of Hon Commissioned Officers is as follows 5- A. Old Rate B.Present Rate C. Proposed bv u p to February* 31 Captain Alban Pay G.C. Total Pay G.C. Total Pay G.C. Total Pay Pay pay Sepoys 30 4 34 25 3 28 20 3 23 L/Haiks 35 4 39 28 3 31 24 3 27 Haiks 40 4 44 34 3 37 28 3 31 L/Havldr• 45 6 51 38 3 41 32 3 35 Havildar 50 15 65 40 6 46 36 6 42 Hav/M&amp;jor 60 15 75 50 6 56 43 6 49 It will be seen from the above table that Captain Alban proposes a further cut (Rate C. ) in the pay of the Levy. He supports this proposal by reference to local labour rates, ana to the fact that some men who cut their names when the reductions from the old rates were made have now applied to be enlisted at rate C. Five recruits have also already been enlistedenlisted at Rs. 20/-^ (vide paragraph 17 of my letter quoted above). On the other hand since last February there have been two cuts in the Sepoys* pay, (and proportionately for other ranis), from Rs* 30/- with Rs. 4/- Good Conduct to Rs. 27/-, and then to Rs. 25/- with Rs. 3/- Good Conduct. Unless the State between now and the end of the year (which is also the Muscat financial year), continues to suffer serious loss in revenue I think any further reduction in pay should be postponed until 1st January 1932. If it is decided that a further reduction (Rate C.) should be made with effect from that date then (a) either the whole ^evy can be put on scale C, those men who do not agree being given of course the option of resigning, or (b) new Recruits can be enlisted at rate C while those already serving can continue to do so at rate B. If (a) is decided on then an increase in the ration rate, (paragraph 9 below), might be made as a compensation. 9. Rations , (paragraph 18 of my letter). The Muscat bevy rations, Captain Alban explains, consist of 1^ lbs. atta per man a day the cost of which is about Rs. 1/14/- per man monthly. The provision of Rs. 3000/- under this head in the Levy budget is therefore sufficient. The ration rate is by no means high and an increase in certain circumstances (see paragraph 8 (b) above) might be considered. 10. Arms and Ammunition. ^paragraph 19 of my letter). From Captain Alban*s report it appears that the present arms and ammunition of the Corps are as follows i- Rifles Ammunition Maxim guns. Lewis guns. Mark VII. Mark VI. Mark VII. Mark VI. *3 1 40 X U0 41,000. 73,000. ♦not 2 as previously reported. ^Captain Alban does not mention how many Mark VI there are but as the Corps normal strength is 150, presumably it is the balance between that number and 40.(a) Captain Alban agrees that the Maxim guns are old and should be replaced as funds permit. As replacement he suggests 4 Vickers Maxims. On grounds of economy, portability, and uniformity of armament necessary in such a small Corps, I would suggest an equivalent number of Lewis guns instead of the Vickers Maxims. I suggest that the raison d*etre, etc. of the Corps might be explained to the General Staff, who perhaps would be good enough to give the benefit of their advice on this point, which of course is a technical one. (b) Rifles. Captain Alban also agrees that the Corps should be rearmed with the Mark VII rifle as funds permit. ( c) Ammunition. Captain Alban* s estimates for the Corps , are as follows : - Mark VII Maxim Gun reserve of 10,000 per gun, for 3 guns-30,000 u n Lewis M it ii 5,000 H ii ii 1 gun - 5,000 ti ti Rifles H II 200 'rifle for 4QriQe s - 8,Q0C 43,000 it it Laxim Gun Practice** 1,000 '• gun for 3 guns - 3,000 d ii Lewis M II II 1,000 II It w gun - 1,000 it M Rifles (1 II 100 '•rifle tor 4© rifles- 4,000 51,000 In hand 41,000 To be purchased • • 10,0 00 Cost ^ 1,060 Captain Alban recommends for financial reasons that the purchase be made next year and not this. I concur. MARK VI. As already noted the balance is 73,000. Captain Alban states that the average consumption per annum on Range Practice will be 7,000, and so no further stock is required, nor is it advisable to try to obtain more of this ammunition as it is old and the proportion oi misfires is high. I concur. (d) On the general subject of the supply of ammunition Captain Alban points out that it is setter to keep small stocks and replenish often, than to keep large ones, as local climatic conditions lead to rapid deterioration. He suggests that some organization is necessary whereby on despatch of a / telegram,telegram, say, to Quetta Arsenal, ammunition couxd in an emergency tie despatched immediately and formalities completed later. Supplies would reach Unseat still quicker from Karachi, and if Government approve the military authori ties might be approached. ^ 11. To sum up. Owing to financial stringency the present strength of the Corps will remain as at present - about 120 - at all events to the end of the year, and vacancies will not be filled up (paragraph 4). There is no change in the nominal scale of the Headquarters Staff, 1 Commandant, and 3 Indian Officers, (paragraph 5). A suggestion for making an economy in the pay of the Commandant has been suggested to Government (paragraph Captain Alban is of opinion that the reduction in the scale of B.C.Os. (paragraph 6) and of followers (paragraph 7), and the reduction in pay (paragraph 8(b)), can stand as permanent measures. Subject to Colonel Biscoe*s approval on his return I concur. Captain Alban, however, suggests that a further reduction in pay might be made. I am of opinion that consideration of this might be postponed (paragraph 8(b)). The question of Rations is dealt with in paragraph 8, while arms and ammunition will be renewed and fresh stocks laid in as funds permit (paragraph 10).

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No.F.25-N/ 31 of 14th September 1931. 2. With regard to question (b) of your letter, I have communicated with the Political Agent, ; uscai/, on this point and vhen I receive his reply will let you have my views. 3. Withi regard to question (a). There is no doubt that the two appointments under consideration, those of Financial Adviser and Comnandant, Levy Corps, are somewhat costly ite^s. Supposing the Commandant to be a Captain, which rank he would normally hold, and which was of the late Commandant, he costs the State about Rs.19,400/- per annum as follows Pay and allowances .♦ Staff Pay •* 855- 0- 400- 0- 1,255- 0- 0 0 TJ Pension contribution § 25% ..

The Financial Adviser costs the State about Rs.17,600 per annum Pay .. 1200-100-1500 Average per mensem Cost per annum H •• Rs. 1,425- 0 - 0 Rs.17,100-0 - 0 Cost of a passage from England on joining and of another on return after 3 years @ £60 per passage distributed over 3 years per annum £ 120 . £ 40 Rs. 540 - 0Rs. 540- 0- 00 Total cost per annum Rs.17,640- 0 - 0 say Rs.17,600/- 5. Thus for the two appointments together the State has to pay an annual sum of Rs.37,000, which, considering the; present financial condition of the St&amp;fce, is a comparatiYe- ly large item in its budget* I am not of opinion, however, that - if it can be avoided - both.these posts should be abolished at present. The State is now passing through a severe financial stringency, and the Levy has in consequence been subjected to various e conomies, including a drastic cut in the pay of the men. The problem of how the Corps is to be kept contented, efficient and adequately armed and ammunitioned under these rot and difficult conditions needs the personal attention of a British officer, as do the financial affairs of the State. I think, however, that the two posts might be combined, provided e. suitable officer can be found to ’double the parts’, and in this connection would draw attention to Colonel Biscoe’s letter NO.2904S of 25th May 1931, in which he suggested Captain Alban could do this successfully. Thiis measure could be regarded as a temporary expedient to get the State through the adverse conditions in front of it during the next yesab or so. At the end of this period, say, about October 1932, it is to be hoped that the State will have reached a more prosperous level, and that the Levy will have thoroughly shaken down its new conditions. The position could then be reviewed afresh, and it mi^it be found possible to do without a British Officer at all. 6# If Government were to accept this proposal then I suggest that Captain Alban should receive Grade Pay .. .. ... Rs. 750. Overseas Pay Rs. 150. Allowance as Commandant Rs. 200. Allowance as Financial) Adviser ) ... r 3 . 200.Peneion contribution from the State at 2S?c would come to Rs.325/- per mensem, and passage contribution to Rs.50/~ per mensem, which would bring the total cost of Captain Alban to the State to Rs. 1,675/- peit mensem and Rs.20,100/- per annum or Rs.700/- more per annum than the last Conmandant. On the other hand the annual cost of the Financial Adviser, i*e. Rs.17,600/- would be saved. 7. The political aspect of a British officer in command of tie Levy must also be considered. The main object of the Levy is defence against the Omani tribes of the interior, and there is no doubt that the presence of a British Officer out at Bait^ul-Falag, the Levy Headquarters, as a sigi manual that the British Government takes an active interest in the defence of the State, has a good effect.

Wylie, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.CONFIDENTIAL. f p. z; a.6S L P l?31 n ?) fi 4 8 1,93.1 ,o Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 487-S. of 1931, dated the 1st August 1931. In continuation of my telegram No. 357, dated the 13th June 1931, I have the honour to attach herewith the budget of the Muscat State for the year 1931, forwarded to me by the Political Agent, Muscat. 2. The outstanding fact in this budget is that in December of this year (the Muscat financial year runs from January to December), the State, if the forecast is correct, will balance its expenditures with its receipts including the repayment of the Government of India loan for 1931 of Rs. 43,000. This is being effected, as will be seen, by drastic economies. 3. The budget is made up of (a) actual receipts and expenditures for the first 6 months of 1931 (January to June), and (b) the estimated receipts and expenditures for the second half of the year (July to December). 4. The second outstanding fact is that it has been prepared, as Captain Alban pointed out in his covering letter, by the Council itself, that is to say largely by Saiyid Said. Mr. Hedgcock left Muscat on 12th June, and when he was here from the 8th to 21st July informed me that before he left, the budget had not yet taken form though the material was there. Saiyid Said had of course the advantage of Mr. Hedgcock’s figures and advice before the latter left Muscat, and I presume it embodies Mr. Hedgcock's main ideas, but much credit is, I think, due to Saiyid Said for the prompt way in which he has tackled the problem. Captain Alban is silent as to his own share in the work, but I have reason to believe that Saiyid Said has had his advice, assistance and encouragement. 5. Our main concern in Muscat finances is three-fold :— (1) That the State should be able to pay bg-ck its debt to the Government of India ; (2) That enough funds should be provided to keep up the Muscat Levy at suitable strength and at suitable efficiency. . The principle under lying the latter is that as the Muscat State depends on naval and— in a crisis—on military assistance from the Government of India, the latter has the right to insist that the State should make reason able preparations in its own defence. This right, however, covers not only the lump sum to be devoted to the upkeep of the Levy, but the headings under which it is to be spent: what is to be the pay of the men, what their rations, how much to be spent on arms and ammunition, re-armament when necessary, and so forth, since it is on items such as these that the efficiency of the Levy depends. Natu rally the representations of the State, particularly in times of financial stringency, will be given due and sympathetic weight, but in the last resort the State must in this matter act according to the wishes of the Government of India. (3) That the State pays its way. Even after the Government of India loan has been liquidated, and even if sufficient funds are allocated for the upkeep of the Levy, we cannot afford to see the State slide into financial disintegration through inability to meet the other claims of its administration. We cannot afford to see this for two reasons : one, because the State is of political and strategical im portance to us, and second, because amongst its debtors are sure to be a number of British Indian creditors. Provided, however, the State preserves its solvency, and fulfils conditions (1) and (2) above, while naturally we are interested in promoting its prosperity as much as possible (vide for instance the action we have taken in trying to get from the French and American Governments for the raise its customs dues), and while our views are always at2 its disposal, we are not—unlike as regards the Levy expenditure— particularly concerned with, though still keeping an eye on, details. We may think that the State would do better to spend more in this direction or less in that, but our interest is confined to friendly advice. &lt; 6. So much recently, inevitably of a detailed nature, has been written on the financial condition of Muscat, that I thought it advisable to take this opportunity of reiterating what I imagine to be the first principles of Muscat finances as far as we are concerned. 7. To apply these first principles to the present budget. With regard to (1)— Government of India loan. It will be noticed that the State has included in its budget repayment of the two instalments for this year. This is not absolutely necessary as in regard to these instalments the State was granted a moratorium by Government as well as for that due in December last (vide Foreign and Political Department letters No. 3719-N/30, dated 10th September 1930 [Serial No. (2) in File No. 139-N/31] and No. F. 35-N/31, dated the 27th May 1931). However, if the State is able at the end of the year to pay up these instalments so much the better, and if not it can take advantage of the moratorium. 8. With regard to (3) —Government expenditure excluding that on the Levy. I have little comment to make. The most useful comment I could make would be in the nature of a detailed analysis as to whether Muscat finances for this year will in reality work out according to the budget forecast. This I confess quite frankly is beyond me, and I imagine beyond anyone else. One of the chief factors for instance is the price of commodities, since the principal revenue of the State depends on its ad valorem customs dues. Another is the dollar (Maria Theresa) exchange. Prices have not fallen, I believe, since last month, but whether they will again continue to fall, or remain steady, or will rise, is beyond all prophesy. The same holds good with regard to the silver exchange. We must simply wait and see. I am asking Captain Alban to obtain from the Council monthly, and let me have a brief statement of the working of each month, beginning with that for July, which I will forward to you on receipt. We will then automatically be kept informed of the financial progress of the State. 9. One item of the general expend ture may be noticed : the cut in the allow ances of the Ruling Family (Civil List). On this subject some correspondence has taken place between Colonel Biscoe and Government (vide paragraph 5 of Colonel Biscoe’s letter No. 395-S., dated 1st August 1930 [Serial No. (1) in File No. 139-N/31]. In the attached budget it will be noticed that a small reduction has been made. On this subject the Political Agent says :— As regards the cut of 5 percent, in the civil list on those drawing Rs. 100 and more, this may be discounted as of no value, it is only a gesture and does not affect the ultimate budget by more than a thousand rupees. “ At the special desire of His Highness the Sultan the allowance of Saiyid Nadir, Saiyid Thajab (a remittance man in Paris, forbidden ever to return to Muscat) and a number of others on the list are untouched, while an aged relative has been added to it at Rs. 95 per mensem. “ The civil list is a question to be left alone now, its members, if pressed too far could make things exceedingly unpleasant both for His Highness and his son.” I think for the present we can leave it at that. 10. The explanation of the Sultan’s varying allowances (4 months Rs. 10,000, 6 months Rs. 5,000, and 2 months Rs. 7,000) is as follows. From January to April inclusive His Highness was in receipt of his full allowance : Rs. 10,000. From then on this was reduced to Rs. 5,000 (vide Government of India telegram No. 893-S. of 26th March 1931 [Serial No. (9) in File No. 40-N/31). His Highness proposes to return to Muscat in November (vide Colonel Biscoe’s express letter No. 256-S.of 12tli May 1931 [Serial No. (13) in File No. 40-N/31] and for that month, and for December, Saiyid Said has provided Rs. 7,000. His Highness once in residence can of course claim his full Rs. 10,000 but he may—in view of the financial straits of the State—be willing to forego Rs. 3,000 per mensem, and doubtless Saiyid Said has consulted him on the subject. In any case the matter can stand over for the time being. 11. M ith regard to (2)—Expenditure on the Levy. This is the subject which needs most attention, and it may be as well to review some general considerations before coming down to details. First—what is the object of the Levy ? This was indicated in paragraph 5 of Colonel Biscoe’s letter No. 83-T. of 27th November 1930 [Serial No. (1) in File No. 19-N/31] which received the approval of the Government of India (Foreign and Political Department letter No. F. 19-N/31, dated the 9th March 1931 [Serial No. (2) ibid]. The object of the Levy is to guard Muttrah and Muscat from attacks of Omani raiders, and to occupy temporarily headquarters of out-districts in an emergency. It will thus be seen that the Levy is not a scattred irregular body on tribal lines whose object is to protect roads through tribal territory, as for instance the Khassadars do on the North-West Frontier, but a compact, regular or semi-regulat, well-trained, well-armed (the Levy has machine guns), and discipline force of men—the only disciplined body in the whole State. Such a body must obviously be worked hard to keep up its standard of efficiency and paid well to attract a good stamp of men, which is particularly necessary as the force is only a small one. There can be no comparison between the local “ askari ” (State soldier), untrained and undisciplined, and the Levy sepoy, and any arguments (Saiyid Said mentioned them to me once or twice when I was in Muscat) based on such a comparison are of course fallacious. As long as a semi-regular force like the Levy is considered necessary at Muscat so long the rate of pay must be adequate to keep it up to the required standard. If at any time such a force is considered unnecessary then the logical course of action is to disband the Levy and employ askaris in its place. What is quite out of the question is to have a force called a Levy at Muscat which by reason of low pay will degenerate into a mob of “ askaris ”. The difficulty is of course to strike the happy mean between over-and under payment. 12. Bearing these factors in mind we have to consider whether in the enthu siasm for economy too big cuts have—or have not—been made in the Levy Expen diture. With regard to numbers. The Levy strength now stands at— Commandant 1 Indian Officers 3 Non-Commissioned Officers 21 Rank and File 105 Followers 12 The total fighting strength is 130, i.e., 20 short of the minimum (150) laid down— vide Government of India letter No. F. 19-M/31 of 9th March 1931 [Serial No. (2) in File No. 19-N/31]. In your express letter No. F. 19-N/31 of 15th May 1931 it was laid down that vacancies of men cutting their names should not be filled for the present, which meant that the Government of ^India contemplated that for a time the Levy should be under strength. According to the present budget the strength of the Levy will apparently remain as it is up to December of this year. I will ask Captain Alban to consult the Council of Ministers as to what prospect there is of the State being able to bring the Levy up to full strength before that date. 14. No alteration has naturally been made in the budget with regard to Headquarters Staff which consists of one Brit sh Commandant and 3 Indian Officers. The former post is temporarily vacant as a measure of economy as arranged by Colonel Biscoe with you.4 15. The number of Non-Commissioned Officers, however, has been consider ably reduced, as follows :— Old scale based on reductions proposed by Captain Walker after Colonel New Biscoe’s visit to Muscat in February Scale. 1931. Havildar Majors Havildars L./Havildars Naiks L./Naiks 2 4 2 10 16 9 (of whom 3 are Act ing)- It has to be determined, having regard to the discipline and training of the Levy, as to whether this Non-Commissioned Officer’s staff is sufficient for the force as a permanent measure, apart from any temporary cut that has had to be made on account of temporary financial stringency, and I will address you again on this subject. 16. Followers have likewise been reduced. I will ask Captain Alban for his views as to whether they are sufficient as a permanent measure for the needs of the Levy. 17. Pay. —The original pay of the rank and file was Rs. 30. In March, after Colonel Biscoe’s visit to Muscat, it was cut down to Rs. 28 with the proviso that if further financial stringency demanded it, a further cut should be made later. Pay has now been reduced to Rs. 25, and 5 new men have, it will be observed, been re cruited on Rs. 20. The arrangement of men serving along each other, doing the same work but drawing different rates of pay is not very satisfactory, though it has, I believe, occurred in the Indian Army, and Rs. 20 represents a very drastic cut; one-third of the original rate. It is of course quite possible to get men of some sort at Rs. 20 or less ; but in view of the considerations put forward in paragraph 11 above, I feel doubtful whether this pay will be adequate to attract the right stamp man, or will be sufficient to induce them to work hard if they actually enlist. I am bringing this point also to the notice of Captain Alban, and on receipt of his views will again address you. In the meantime I am instructing him that no more men at Rs. 20 are to be enlisted without reference to me. 18. Rations—The allotment for rations for the remaining 6 months in the year is only Rs. 3,000—which is distinctly inadequate compared with the original allotment for this purpose. Rations are of course an important item from the point of view of a Levy sepoy. It may be, however, that there is a stock of surplus rations over from the previous 6 months. I am making enquiries on this point. X 19. Arms and Armament. —The Levy is at present armed with two makes of rifles—40 modern S. M. L. E. and the remainder old non-charger loading magazine Lee Enfields. Uniformity is obviously necessary and as funds permit the Levy should be re-armed with the newer weapon, and also have a sufficient reserve of ammunition for emergencies and musketry training. The Levy also has the follow ing machine guns:— • . 2 Maxim guns. 1 Lewis gun. The former are reported to be of 4 ‘very doubtful efficiency ”, and if so should presumably be returned to store and new ones purchased as funds permit. The amount allowed under “ Arms and Ammunition ” Rs. 1,300 is obviously inadequate to provide for any sort of re-armament, as will as to build up a reserve of ammuni tion, but I suppose this is all that is available for the moment. 20. The other items in the Levy Expenditure do not seem to call for any comments. 21. Summary.— outstanding fact of the Muscat budget is that—if the forecast is correct—it will balance by next December, which is the end of the Muscat financial year, including repayment of the' Government of India instal ments for this year (paragraph 2 above). To a certain extent it has been made* that the Political Agent, Muscat, telegraphs that the revised and balanced budget will come into force on 1 st July, from which date the State corrmences to become solvent. We are rather in the dark as to the exact nature of this budget. Mr. Hedgcock's revised budget estimated Major Fowle's telegram of 13th June states a deficit on the year’s working of Rs.94,000 after taking into consideration the savings that would accrue from a reduction of Rs.5,000 a month in the Sultan s allowance and the economies recently effected in the Levy Corps budget. This deficit has temporarily been reduced by Rs.46,740 by postponement of the repayment to the Government of India of this year's instalment of the State's loan. The further economy of Rs.£ per mensem in the pay of the Levy Corps will bring in another Rs.4500, and there will be a saving of some Rs.1200 a month while the post of Financial Adviser (Mr. Hedgcock’s resignation took effect from 30th June) remains -unfilled. No doubt the State and the Political Agent have been able to advise some further small economies to complete the bridgirg of the gap£ */ SEEN POLITICAL.

The special circumstances which have given rise to this are explained in the first part of paragraph 4 of the Resident's covering despatch. He is not without hope that by careful organisation some improvement on Mr. Hedgeock's/Hsdgcock’s estimate may be possible. T,T e have now received the Government of India’s recommendations on the modification of the tariff provisions of the United States and French Treaties, and a submission has been made on them. If we can get an early decision this may go some way to ease the situation. The Resident has further recommended postponement of the repayment of this year’s instalment (Rs.46,740) of the State’s loan to the Government of India, while the Government of India, in the light of the serious situation disclosed, have issued instructions that the possibility of further economies by a reduction in the pay of the Levy Corps should at once be explored, and that pending further orders vacancies in the Levy Corps should remain unfilled, provided that the strength of the Corps is not reduced below 100 . --7 ■ ' [ay‘-*f c, (xCU ^Ua*A Pz*n* /^*** &lt;3k ■‘7 S’-Wc U+J flf&gt; f*CL:T.CAL COMMITTEE. l'7Jl)N 1951BY AIR i£AIL.

In paragraph 12 I referred to the review by Mr* Hedgcock of the financial position in which he had estimated a deficit on the current year*s working at Rs*78,000 and I expressed the opinion that if sanction was accorded to certain measures recommended by me - notably a reduction in His Highness* allowance and the grant of tariff autonomy to the state - the deficit of Rs.78,000 would be converted into a credit of about Rs.50,000* I have now received Mr. Hedgcock^s revised budget and it would seem from that that the figures I gave were too optimistic* 3. In his revised budget of which I enclose c copy, Mr. Hedgcock estimates a deficit on the year’s working of Rs. 94,000 and this is after taking into consideration the savings that will accrue from the reduction sanctioned m the s allowance and from the economies recently effected in the Levy Corps 'budget* 4*.; 'The principal reason for this state of affairs is the unprecedented fall in the customs receipts, inuring the'‘month of February they were down over Rs. 10,000 as compared with last year’s figures and Mr. Kedgcock has estimated a total decrease for the year of Rs. 80,000 under this one head. Another factor which has further aggravated the situation is the presence of large stocks in the hands of the merchants. Apparently, last year when prices first began to ease, the merchants, not suspecting a world drop in prices such as has occurred, bought heavily in anticipation ox a rise in prices, and they are consequently now saddled with these surplus stocks of which they will have to dispose before placing fresh orders. The figures now supplied by hr. Kedgcock have been obtained only with a good deal of difficulty: they only give totals under each head and no explanations of any differences from the previous figures are given so that a proper scrutiny of them is impossible* They are however necessarily based on various hypotheses which by their very nature are necessarily uncertain and I hope that by more careful organization it will become possible materially to increase the customs receipts and other sources of revenue and to effect still further economies in the administrative services. Nevertheless, it seems certain that on the year's working there will be at any rate a small deficit and it is clear that the State is not in a position to pay off the instalment of the Government of India loan which falls due this year. The Council have therefore asked for a postponement of this year's instalments of the loan, and I support their request. In letter No. 3719-h/30, dated the 10th September 1930 from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department the period for the repayment was extended to December 1932 and under the circuxa-3 [U circumstances explained I recommend that the period should again he extended hy another 12 months till December 1933® 5® From a perusal of the budget it is evident that some action should be taken as early as possible if the state is to be restored to solvency# As 1 have already explained in my letter ho. 202-3 of the 22nd April 1931, matters have reached an impasse and under present conditions it is unlikely that any further reforms will be introduced, and for this reason I would ask for an early decision to the proposal contained in my letter referred to above that the resignation of 2&amp;r • Hedgcock should be accepted and that Captain Alban when he proceeds to Muscat should advise the state in financial mat ters* I I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- H.

After prolonged discussion with the Political Agent, the new Financial Adviser and the Commandant of the Muscat Levy Corps, Colonel Biscoe is of opinion that the financial condition of the State M though serious and calling for prompt remedial measures, is not desperate'. It appears that it should be possible to reduce the bill of the chief creditor from Rs. 86,000 to about half a lakh; that a number of minor administrative economies can probably be effected (paragraph 9); and that a saving of about Rs.12,000 (this figure represents a compromise reached after personal investigation by the Resident) can be made in the cost of the Levy Corps. If in addition to this tariff autonomy can be/—•'— be secured from Great Britain, France and the United States (this natter is under separate consideration) and the Sultan’s allowance can be reduced to Rs.5,000 (a telegram sanctioning this is under submission), there should be some hope of restoring financial equilibrium and even of converting the present deficit of Rs.78,000 into a credit of about Rs.50,000. Once the Sultan’s allowance has been reduced, the Financial Adviser and the Heir Apparent between them may be in a position to bring about certain reductions in the allowances paid to members cf tne Ruling Family. It seems clear from paragraph 5 of the letter that it is contemplated that any such reductions shall be riade by and in the name of the State authorities, and that His Majesty’s Government will not appear. The Sultan himself, as will be seen from paragraph 5 , is at the moment entirely out oi touch, having given no address either to his bank or elsewhere when he proceeded on his tour to Ceylon. ir VaXu/5 'TA*- U.

Orders hare not been received as yet regarding the reduction of His Highness* allowance* His Highness has disappea eci and no one knows where he is* He wrote to 3 i 3axd say in that he intended proceedin f to Ceylon, but giving no address, and s&amp;yin that he would write again when he returned to India* His Highness deals with a French bank in Bombay, but his bank too do not know his address* *e can therefore but wait until Hie Highness returns to i&gt;ehra un, in order to e et in touch with him again* 1 would however request that e&amp;rly orders should be issued regarding the reduction of his allowance* The Financial Adviser hopes to bring about certain reductinns I in the family allowances with the co-operation of &gt;^ 1' 3 xi, it W ixi enormously strengthen the letter's hands if he can point out that the ^ultan's allowance has also been reduced* 6* Mr# Kedgcock anticipates that in view of the Sultan’s proloat-ed absence, it will probably be necessary to Increase 3 id's allowance to some extent either directly or indirectly in the form of an entertaining allowance, • • • •allowance, but in any case if the reduction I have propoeed is sanctioned promptly there will be a saving to the state of about Re.40,000 this year. the tariff question will presumably take some time to settle and for the reasons stated above I consider it essential that the reduction in the Sultan's allowance should toe effected without delay. I would therefore ask that separate orders should be issued regarding this. 7 # As regards debts due to local merchants referred to ^ r paragraph's of my despatch referred to above r. Hedgcock considers that the sum due to Khan Bahadur Hasito will be capable of reduction. There is no doubt that the prices at which supplies have been issued are in certain cases exorbitant, and it is hoped that it will be possible to reduce the Khan Bahadur’s bill from Rs.86,000 to about half a lakh. In any case he has amassed much wealth at the expense of the state, and there is no particular reason why he should not wait for his money till a more convenient time, if necessary. s regards customs dues Mr. Hedgcock informs me that he is not in favour of a uniform tariff and considers that the duty on articles comprising the food oi the poor should onl&gt; be increased very slightly, while luxury articles might be taxed at higher rates with a maximum of 2S$ on alcohol and itobacco. He was anxious to obtain for the state full tariff .autonomy and then to draw up © detailed tariff. With this jview I am in agreement. 9 t Hedgeock has already discovered many administra tive anoiaalies in the state, of which I will only cite a few examples. The *1-1 ^aid* has a crew of 25, and it is only a fair siaed launch and could certainly be run by a much smeller personnel. The e is a prison in Muttrah and another one in Muscat, each with a certain number of watchmen, and- r b /■N in each of them there are only about two priocmero. They could otJTioualy fee coafetried* 'he state hac a dhow which A» at present on the fee&amp;ch at Muscat* U has no crew but there ie a nahhuda who draws He*3a a aionth for nominal coamand and residea in Uuttrahi there are ;aany sinecures of a similar nature* The abolition of auch posts would enable certain economies to fee effected* ioreover the fertile district of A oAiar only contributed Ke*ltdQO to the central treasury last year* -he *ali is a brother of Kie iiighness and has adopted a contumacious attitude towards the ( ouncil* iiisre is ns doubt that this area should produce a mteh larger revenue* even after the expenses of administration have been deducted* 10* The chief expenditure however which Mr.fiedgooek has attacked is that of the Lev y Corps , The levies ars undoubtedly wall paid, and the rates of pay drawn by them are hi^h compared with those, for instance, of the state askaris in 3 ur and outlymt posts. I was given to understand that these rates had long been regarded as a grievance fey tiis itate o^ncil, and .r* hed : .c ck con template^ r drastic reduction in them. The matter bad forsiied the subject of prolonged discussions between Lr* Aied^oock and Cap a in talker and the Political Agent, and I was informed on arrival thfct an agreement had been made between theja under which a reduction of about He* 21,000 would be made in the expenditure on the Levy Corps. Capt^ in talker, h wever, had only agreed to this under the very strungeet pressure, and because he had been told that the financial condition of the state was desperate, and he had placed on record that the proposed cut 1 must detract from the content of the corps* th* t it remained to be sean how it would affect discipline! * rid hf * anticipated that »•♦th't » oQnaidankle nuaber of at&gt;n woalvl out tbolr iwcaaB und. that thou a h roaruitB would be found to replace ***** the wtaadurd of pJ^wl^uc, already poor, would Buffer. .lie levy Corp*. ae the uovtniBient of xn la arc cw -ie* have done extraordinarily good work of latej in addition to their norsaal duties they have Bade roads and proved a value le aaeet to the state. Captain alker inforaed ae that ow*»e. to the fact that they were well paid he could with coiuiatcce call on the corps at the preeent time to do any kind of work and they woulc respond readily. He felt that the out proposed wae excessive and that there would no louder be the eame u.- r.t in the Corpe. faking these cirouaetanoes into consideration 1 oauld not help feeling that ir. liedgeceh after a very short experience in the state was proceeding a little precipitately and 3 therefore told the Council and him that, in m opinion, it weula be preferable to aake a aamlier cut in the first instance, it was ultimately decided to reduce the sepoys' pay by osuy i s.2 and other ranks proportionately and to reduce the pay d M uie of the non-ail. tary personnel of the Corpe» at the eatoe time a eum of he.8000 hae been provided trm the re-araament c- the Corps. he net reeulte of these measures is to effect a saving of about Ae* 12,000. 1 think this is suifioisnt for the time being and that it would have been a pity to have gone further in the first instance. Captain lalker informed me that be did not oonsiier that these reductions would in any way adversely affect the contentment or morale of the Corps.

It is hoped also to uake some reduction in the family allowances* to obtain appreciably more revenue from Sohar and some increase of revenue from uur. will be seen that those figures are based on various hypotheses* and It ie almost impossible to draw up any accurate estimates, but the combined effect of all these measures rhould be to convert a deficit of Re.78*000 into a credit of about | ju. 50*000. it is for this reason that I hare stated that while the finances of the state do call for a drastic re-organ 1nation and prompt application of reasdi&lt;i measures and the situation is undoubtedly serious* yet in ray opinion it is not desperate, and I hope it may’ be possible so to re-organise the finances that the State will be at any rate solvent if not prosperous. If a year hence a further fall in prices or other causes have prevented the budget being balanced the matter can be reconsidered. 13 # Mr. Thomas has at length turned up at Bahrain having crossed the .uba-al— ; hali and travelled fi’o;n ofar to r star# This is the first time i believe that this journey •«•journey been done by &amp; European, and it «rill doubtless have inmerestin^ rceulta from a geographical point of view* ihatever my be said, however, for rho^e* journey • froxa the point of view of exploration and science* and tnot^h one cannot but feel some admiration for hie endurance and courage - hie journey oould perfectly well htve been post poned until he had relinquished charge at 'aecat, and handed over to hie successor, and hie actions in proceeding without leave and leaving hie successor to grapple with a new eituatiun unaided is indefensible* oreover there is not the least doubt that his administration of the finances has left much to be desired and that the greatest laxity has been allowed to prevail* 14. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India* 1 have the honour to be* dir $ four most obedient servant, sd/- H &lt;v&lt;Biscoe i.t.Colonel, i oliticul ixssideiit m the Persian dulf*Notes. 0 Minute Paper.

M/.R jg;fl Previous Papers ■ We have received three omKBtmm despatches from the Political Resident on the subject of the Sultan's desire to abdicate; the revision of the French and American Treaties with Muscat ( and incidentally of our own Treaty of 1891); and on the financial situation of the State. These four subjects are to some extent interconnected, but it appears desirable that they should, so far as possible, be dealt with independently. The present submission deals solely, therefore, with the financial situation disclosed in Colonel Biscoe’s despatch of 27th January, No. tfTjzo) 7-T, and does not enter into detailed examination of the proposals for tariff revision/ 4475b 1000 5.30revision (as affecting Prance and Great Britain) submitted in the same despatch. These will be dealt with on the tariff revision file. X- The position is briefly that we have hitherto been under the impression that, while the Muscat financial situation was extremely unsatisfactory, it ought to be possible to make ends meet by the revision of the tariff provisions of the French and U.S.A. Treaties with Muscat, if this could be secured, coupled with a rigid internal economy. The fact that the Arms Traffic subsidy of Rs.l lakh is personal ^o the present Sultan and ceases mth the cessation of his rule, and the fact that his abdication would involve the State in a liability for a pension to him which in present circumstances it could not afford, were strong arguments for persuading His Highness to delay his abdication until the general financial situation was better. Prom the despatch now submitted it appears that the new Financial Adviser, Mr. Hedgcock, on taking over the duties hitherto performed hy Mr. Bertram Thomas, at the end of December, found that the financial position was materially worse than had been represented. The accounts appear to have been carelessly kept; the rate of exchange at which the dollar was calculated is described as 'wholly fictitious'; and finally, debts have been incurred with local merchants which had not been disclosed and which apparently had not previously appeared in the accounts. The general effectwis to show a deficit (excluding the balance of the Government of India loan, amounting to Rs.77,841) on 1st January, 1931, of rather over Rs.2 lakhs, while the immeuiate (para. 4) financial stringency was such/.that an overdraft of Rs. , was essential if the State was to be able to obtain sufficient funds to pay its way for a month or two until measures to deal with the situation could be devised by * r - s ^f^ ously/4793a 5000 10 30 conduct/ Minute Paper. 4. Simultaneously we received intimation of the Sultan ? s failure to return to Muscat and his desire to abdicate on a pension. 5. The proposals submitted by the Resident for dealing with the situation are summarised in paragraph 14 of his present Despatch. The position in regard to them is as follows:- The Government of India have agreed that an overdraft of Rs.50,000 may be secured from the Imperial Bank of India in return for a lien on the Zanzibar subsidy - p.Z. S10/31. They have separately recommended to the Secretary of State approval of the Resident 1 s recommendation that the Sultan’s allowance of Rs.10,000 per mensem should be immediately reduced to Rs.5,000 (this is being submitted simultaneously on P.Z. -114/31). They have also expressed their agreement in principle with the suggestion that His Majesty's Government should try to obtain acceptance by the French of raost-favoured-nation tariff treatment f&lt;H? Muscat, a subject on which they promise more detailed comments in due course, and regarding which a separate submission will be made (P.Z. 1048/31, copy below). From their telegram on the subject it would appear that they may be 1 • prepared to contemplate, as recommended by the Resident, the revision of Article 6 of the Treaty of 1891 between . Great Britain and Muscat which provides for a maximum of 5/ duty. The recommendation in (5) of paragraph 14 of the i Resident’s present despatch is one which can best be considered in connection with the proposed tariff revisions 6. The situation is very unsatisfactory and action on the lines recommended by the Resident appears to offer the best hope of progress. Mr. Thomas's i Department.conduct is open to severe criticism, though this will no doubt be to a large extent obliterated by the credit whidh he has secured in a different sphere by his successful crossing of the Rub-al-Khali. From the 'Times” he appeals now to be in Bahrein, and it is possible that the Resident may make some attempt to bring pressure on him x) reduce conditions in the Muscat Treasury to order before he returns to this country. u C7. /olaC^xa) Zl.a ’U , r, Mb SEEN.

This opinion was b;sed on figures supplied to me by the then lisancial Adviser. Two days ego however, j received from the xolitical ^gent e copy of a report addressed to him by the new Financial dviser, which discloses e very different state of affairs and 8ho*8 that the information supplied to me in the pastX - 2 - St *4 V r : p tz 1 K^U/7~ t -w** autiroly misleadiDK. This report, of »hich I enclone a 2 copy herewith, tiao necessitated a reconsideration of ny prerioua recomraendatione, and therefore sent K\y tel«araai ref erred to above isKin^ that action on y dee t &gt;Rtch no # l-T of 17th January 19«.&gt;1 should i&gt;e suspended • 3. It will be seen fro . this thnt the fi ancial position of the t&gt;tate differs amterially from what it was represented to be, owing to two causes; firstly, debts have besn incurred with local merchants, which have not been disclosed and which apparently have not appeared in the accounts, and secondly, the rate of exchange at which the dollar was calculated was wnolly fictitious. Further, as will be seen f rom ^r.iiedgcocX* s report, the accounts i ppe? r to have been kept in a most irregular and hapnaa^rd fashion, and I enclose an exact copy of the account raaintained with &gt;»yn 5 ahatiur !»asib, the chief creditor* The account contains not a single date, and, while showing a total indebtedness of ris.86,000/«*, was kept on a loose shiet of paper with no details of any description. ±f is is a fair sam le of the system prevailing in the Muscat Treasury, it is clear that the most disgraceful laxity has bt.en allowed to prev il, •specially having regard to the fact that the 3tate had a highly paid British officer as its financial adviser. «• ^ will further be seen from Mr.Hedgeock*s report hat th«/re was not on the 3iat neoemter enough money in the Treasury to pay the salaries of officers. To meet the press^ ng need for ready money Mr.Hedgeock has *sked the political Agent for authority to obtain a temporary over draft from tde impcr.al nmc of inaia of s.50,006/-, and this request I nave supported to uovernaent in ;qy el• gram ? s o. T-lo of 2bth Janua ry 931, and 1 trust sancti n will be accorded to it. It is ssssntial that the 5tat* should be nble to obtain sufficient funds to pay jLts way for a monthto deal wi ih the situation 5* I trust also th^t early orders will de Issued for the reduction of the dultan's allowance to ^s«5000 per aensem* This will ease the situation for the time toeing. It has been suggested to the heir-apparent toy Mr. Hedgcook that cuts should toe imde in the allowance of other members of the royal family. This is a matter in which 9 I think f it is desirable to proceed somewhat slowly, but if the Sultan's allowrnce is reduced it will considerably strengthen the hands of uaiyid Said in dealing with the * other riembers of the family. 6. «hen the position was pointed out to the Council by Mr.Hedgcock, they addressed a letter to the Political Agen. in which they stated that in their opinion the increases in the customs duties originally proposed would not toe adequate and asked that the rates should toe raised to 10^ on general merchandise and 2d* on alcohol and tobacco, tout stated that in this matter they would toe prepared to be guided toy my advice. To this end they have asked me (l) to obtain the consent of His Majesty's Govt rnraent to a revision of the first sentence of Article 6 of the treaty of 1891 to read as follows*- 'His Highness the dultan shall be permitted, subject to his treaty obligations to other foreign powers, to levy a duty of entry not exceeding 1G.£ on general merchandize and 25^t on alcohol and tobacco, on the value of all goods arid merchandize of whatever description, imported oy sea from foreign countries into His Highness* dominions'.{2) to obtain th« consent of His Majesty*8 Government to the introduction of the increased customs rates in anticipation of the formal ratification of the suggested amendment of the treaty of ld91* 7# The lolitical Agent 9 in forward ng taie proposal, points out that goods imported in &gt;reach and American ressels would etill only pay ^ until tne treaties with those lowers had been amended, but as no French or American steamers call at Muscat, in practice no preference would be given to french or American goods* The proposal howsrer is somewhat similar to that contained in paragraph 5 of n ia office letter ©* ,6667 of 27th isrsmber 1929 to the foreign Office, ana was objected to by the Foreign Office for the reasons given in paragraph 3 of their letter bo, -6207/166/91 of 51st January I960* From a perusal of those letters, however, it would stem that there was some misapprehension regarding the position of France and the United states* Under its treaties with those lowers, the Muscat State cannot charge more than &amp; on goods imported in ships belonging to them} there is nothing how ever to prevent the State Charging any rate of duty which they choose on F ench or American goods not imported in French or American vessels, and as no French or American vessels call at Muscat nowadays, the go de of tt.ose countries would not obtain any preferential ates* 8, further t the situation vis-a-vis thsse two lowers hrs since developed considerably, and they have both expresseu their willingness to agree to an increase in the customs tariff* Moreover in his tel^^r&amp;m Jo*267(ri),dated the 16t June 1930( of which a copy was forwarded to me under •••under Foreign and Politic 1 department endorsement So. J-.3444/»-30of 30til July 1330}, His jesty's , nxbassador at Washington ©ported that the nuer Secretary liad written semi-officially stating that, in the event of United non- discriminatory increases being ^mue in duties on goods Imported into Muscat ( pending the conclusion of a new treaty ^ with the united states, the &amp;tate department would probably not have occasion to protest. 9.

Major T.C.Fowle,0.B.E., Political Agent and H.B.M's Consul Muscat.A review of the present financial position of the State of Muscat, 1) The Budget for 1930 estimated Receipts at Rs.9,77,700 Expenditure at w 9,77,700 (which included two half- yearly instalments, each of Rso21,750 of the Govt* of India loan.) The real position was less satisfactory than these figures indicate. There were on 31-12-29 undisclosed outstanding State liabilities to local merchants and others of approximately Rs*75,000; the exact amount cannot be ascertained, as under the existing system of accounts dates are not always inserted* These outstandings first began to accumulate in February 1928. In addition, the sum of Rs*44,645 was due to officials and others on account of pay and allowances for December* the cash in hand to meet these claims amounted to Rs#3l,290. The total net State liabilities on 31-12-29 were thus Rs*88,355.,approx.,exclusive of the Government of India loan. 2) a* The accounts as maintained by the Ministry of Finance give, according to the figures presented to me, the results on last year*s working as below; Receipts Rs.9,51,859 Expenditure .... Rs.9,52,000 Prima facie, the State just about managed to make ends meet last year. The account books, however, are no true guide to the actual position; the explanation is a surprising one, or would be if one’s capacity for surprise were not already exhausted. Revenue paid in dollars and baizas is brought to account at the rt official Treasury rate of exchange”(Rs.125 - $ 100 )• This bears no relation to the current rate of exchange, but is, in the words of my Treasury Officer,'the rate which was in force when I took up my post two years ago”. Today’s exchange has dropped to Rs.68 = #l00. The cash balance on paper thus never corresponds with • • •-2 with the actual cash in hand, a lact wh.ch does i.ot disturb n\y Treasurer^ equanimity. b. I have had a second set of figures worked out at the average monthly current rate of exchange. These showi Rs.a # 46,174 Ks.a # 44,204 Receipts ••••• Expenditure •• The above figures give a more accurate idea of the sums actually received and spent, but they do not reveal that the State’s liabilities to local merchants and others had increased by about Hs.41,577 during the course of the year. 3) The State’s liabilities on 31-12-30 were as under: (a) Due to local merchants etc. Ifor details see Appendix A) Rs.1,16,577 (b) l.Due to officials etc.,as As.48,470 pay for December 2.Gash in hand to meet December pay (a rears of revenue are negligible) het deficit under this Ks.29,168 • • • • Rs. 19,302 19,302 head Rs.1,35,879 Total outstandings on 31-12-30 4) Of the outstanding liabilities of Rs.1,16,577 mentioned above,Rs.84,145/5/0 is owed to Khan Bahadur Easib: for details see Appendix B. I have had made for retention in this office a carefully checked copy of the State’s account with Hasib. The original document is nt‘.ached herewith as a curiosity. It is, as will be observed, a loose sheet of paper; not a word of explanation appears, nor a Single date. Actually the acco nt is made up to the end of November, and the three columns represent rupees, dollars, and baizas. 5) a. Thejdraft budget for 1931, as submitted to me on arrival and roughly revised by myself, provides as under: Estimated ...-3- Estimated receipts Hs.8,45,000 M expenditure Re. 9.23.775 • Deficit .. Rs. 78,775 5. Estimated receipts are 'based on last year’s actuals. For further particulars see Appendix G. Estimated expenditure is also based on last year’s actual expenditure, and will be found roughly to correspond to the sum of (pj cash actually expended lb) last year’s deficit ^c) the second half-yearly instalment of the Govt.of India loan, for which a postponement was secured last year. Fuller particulars are given in Appendix E. As ’’cheese-paring economies” have been the order of the day for the past few years, it is difficult to see at a first glance how substantial savings can be made in^xpenditure. Adequate increases in revenue can only be achieved by imposing new taxation. An increase in the customs rate is under active consideration; this question will be made the subject of a separate report. 6) Working to the above budget, the financial position at the close of the present year will be* Deficit on the year’s working (see para.5a above) ... Rs.78,775 Net outstanding liabilities (as on 31-12-30(see para.3.) ”1,35,879 Total deficit at end of 1931. ... Rs. 2,14,654 The auove figures do not include the balance of the Govt, of India loan, amounting to Rs.77,841. 7) , It must be emphasized that the system of accounts here makes it impossible to guarantee any of the figures. It may, however, be safely assumed that the State of Muscat ’s finances is substantially as shown aocve. 8) I hope by next week to put up tentative proposals for remedying matters.

That is to say, the total cost to the merchant of a package of dates is 0 40 plus 0 1 customs duty- ^ 41. It seems to he imagined that though the merchant can pass on the increased dollar cost of the commodity, amounting to 0 20, Kaaxe an attempt to pass on the extra dollar of customs duty may cahse the tribesman to resort to his rifle. The above extract was written as an argument against the Political resident’s proposal that customs should be levied at the prevailing rupee rate of exchange. The arguments are redundant, for the simple reason that the duty is, and has been for the past ten years at least, levied at that rate. The truth is that, the duty being both in theory and in practice ( as I have ascertained) on an 'advalorem' basis, the fall in the dollar exchange has had'no direct effect on the customs receipts, and is by no means the primary cause of the deficit on the last year’s working. The decrease in customs revenue can in the main be attributed to quite a different cause - the fall in world prices. 3). The second extract reads as under;- 'The interior currency in Oman being predominantly dollars, the apparent purchasing power of the country has fallen with the price of silver some 18/£ during the past three months. Whether or no this is the case the State ±x itself with largely a rupee basis for its expenditure side must face losses on exchange' (No.25 of 22/3/30). The purchasing power of the bulk of the inhabitants is made up, not only of silver dollars, but also of exportable natural proddcts. Of each tribesman it can in general be said that this purchasing power is represented by so many sheep, camels, or date palms, and, if he resembles the Arab • of • •••••• o • • -3- of other countries, a comparatiyely small amount of money. Hence the diminution of his purchasing power due to the fall in the value of the dollar has been relatively small. The same may be said of the country as a whole* Oman uses two silver currencies, of which that represented by the rupee has remained constant; further, the drop in the dollar value has been spread over many years, thus enabling merchants to adjust themselves to a rupee instead of a dollar standard, as many have done. Speaking generally, though individuals may have been hit, the country itself has escaped more lightly* There are even indications that the purchasing power of the country has improved, but these need not be discussed here* The contention that the State'must face losses on exchange” also needs qualification. The State, working on a rupee basis, can make and actually has made a useful profit through the fall in the dollar exchange. Part of the district staff is engaged and paid on a dollar basis; the actual sum involved is 29,500 per annum. It has cost the State about half the number of rupees to pay these people this year, as compared with last year. Customs contribute &amp;§■ lakhs of a total revenue of 8^ lakhs* These, being on an ad valorem basis, do not result in any loss on exchange.

Prom The Hon’hle Lt.Colonel H.V.Biscoe,I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. Sir, In continuation of my telegrajn No. T.l, dated the 17th January 1931, I have the honour to forward herewith two alternative drafts amending article 10 of the French treaty of 1844. 2. Draft (a) allows the Muscat State to impose a customs duty of 7 i% on all goods except alcoholic liqueurs and tobacco, on which duty may be raided to 15%. Draft (b) allows the Muscat State full tariff autonomy, both in respect of exports and imports, while according to the Frencljrpost favoured nation treatment. 3* Under the treaty of 1844 the Muscat State have undertaken not to levy duty exceeding 5% on goods imported in French bottoms, but there is nothing to prevent the Muscat State levying any duty it pleases on French goods imported in vessels that are not French, for instance by British India Steam Navigation Company steamers, provided the British Government do not object under Article 6 of the treaty of1891.4 A tariff based on the nationality of the vessel in which the goods are imported instead of on the country of origin of the goods themselves would seem to he of little practical value to the French nowadays, and in the revised drafts I have suggested that this should he altered, and that in future the duty fixed should he applicable to goods of French origin however imported instead of to the cargoes of French vessels. This would seem to he a possible lever to use to the French to induce them to grant the Muscat State full tariff autonomy both in respect of imports and exports, provided they obtain most favoured nation treatment in return. 5 . In the reviseddrafts I have omitted the latter portion of Article 10 of the present treaty which deals with the charges to he levied on vessels as opposed to those which are levied on goods. This is not at present a practical issue since no harbour dues are levied at Muscat and there is only one dhow at Sur nowadays that flies the French colours, so if the French desire that these clauses should he retained, I see no serious objection. They are, however, in my opinion, out of date and not in accord with present day principles or practice, and if at some future occasion the Muscat State desire to levy harbour dues to meet the cost of facilities provided it would seem desirable to obtain for them the power to do so. As long as they obtain the most favoured nation treatment in this respect which the treaty already grants them the French would seem to have little ground for complaint.will he seen 'that/ “the drait/ arljicies are on the analogy of the American draft, hut the last sentence of Article i is omitted ineach case, since the French already enjoy most favoured nation treatment in respect of all privileges accorded to other nationals under Article ii of their present treaty. 7 # i trust therefore that it will he possible to obtain an agreement of the French Government to an amendment of the treaty on the line^of draft (b) which will certainly he the more advantageous to the Muscat State. Firstly, it would permit of their raising the duties higher should they desire to do so on some future occasion and secondly, it authorises them to levy export duty. Moreover, although with their somewhat primitive methods of administration a flat rate on all merchandise with the exception of liqueurs and tobacco is probably the most convenient form of tariff for the State, in future years it may be to their advantage to vary the customs duty on different articles, and it is very desirable that they should have power to do so. 8. In view of the present critical condition of the Muscat finances, I trust it will be possible to obtain the consent of the French Government and the United States of America to a revision of their treaties at an early date. q # i am sending a copy of this despatch to nis Majesty's Secretary of State for India., I have, etc. (Sd.)

The final result is lir* Thomas' letter Ho.C 52/48 of 20th July 1930, attached herewith, which I trust - together with the few com. en s X have to .oake ob it — will put the Resident in possession of the information he desires. 2* The anticipated deficit for the remaining months of the year, due to eireumetances entirely beyond the control of the State, i.e* the fall in the foliar, is Ra*25,000 ( para II of Mr*Thomas* letter)* I &gt; would be- 2 - He inmdTi»a&gt;»le to carry out the suggestion made in para 3 of the letter under reference. (i*e. to levy Custozuo Duties payable in dollars at the prevailing rupee rate of exchange) for the reason given in ‘fhoims* letter para III. The enforcement of such a suggestion would in all probability have to be carried out by the J'uscat State by force with assistance froa us 9 a course of action which, in this particular connection, I presume we are not willing to pursue* ^ 3* It should be noted,(vide para VIII of Hr.Thomas* f letter to be read with the graph shown in appendix 2), that the State spends much more than it receives for the first six months of any year, and reverses the process in the last six. Thus if the date harvest, political conditions, etc., are normal the Budget should balance \ on the 31st of December. Though, as will be seen, this did not happen in 1929. 4* To aaet the anticipated deficit Ut*.Thomas origin ally made four proposals ( para VII of his letter). Proposals I and 2 have not been imposed for the reasons given by Mr.Thoms, with which I concur. 5. Proposal 3 cannot be expected to bring anything in this year. Details as to this proposal are given in Major Murphy’s letter $o.i8-C of the 30th May 1950 para 3 and 4. I recommend that sanction be given to bring this proposal into force in due course. 6. To Proposal 4 - as pointed out in your prede cessor’s letter Ho.129-3 of the 17th April 1930 para 2- the Political Resident is averse. I venture to observe that personally I am entirely of the Resident's opinion. U I The \3- The Measure of control already adopted vith regard to the Haling yaaily’s debts (ride para IX of tfr^Thonas' letter 9 and also correspondence ending with nor letter NO'd2-»C of the 1st July 1930) has already raised a pro test from the Member a of the Family* The imposition of a K eat' in the /vulin^ Family’s allowances would be very unpopular with all the Family from Sultan downwards 9 and might bring tne latter to a step nearer his long threatened abdication* 7* To meet the anticipated deficit there are two course© open to us* One is to enforce proposals t 9 2 and. 4 which will bring between He.2,850 per mensem,not- / -• withstanding the serious objections against them. If these could be put into fot*ee with effect from the 1st August, during the remaining fire months of the year they would bring in Rs.14,250. This weald still leaTe a deficit of Tic*10,750 which would hawe to be raised by equally unpopular measures• 8* The other course, as preposed by Ur* Thorns in his para X , is not to put these proposals into fdree but to '/ apply to the Government of India for a progressive moratorium of six months for the remaining refund instal ments (Re.21,745 half yearly) due on their loan to the State of 6-fc lakhs. That is to say the instalment due in December next will be paid in June 1931, and so forth* I strongly recommend for the Resident’s consideration that this moratorium be asked for. It will be noticed that, as Mr.Thomas points out, the State has beon exemplary in paying up it© instalments, and considering that the present financial stress in which the StateState finds itself is due to a cause «• the fall of the dollar - quite outside its control, I do not think it unreasonable to suggest the.t this smll concession j»i^iit be obtained from the Gev^rmasnt of India.

H«»d tne dollar excuan^e not i&amp;llen there would have been no deficit on the year’s wording. This deficit arises from customs tui^ ^a-at ta^aticni having at present to be collected in dollars e.g. 3ur and the Latinah coast. The political situation in woth places militates against the tax collector insisting on collection in rupees or in the rupee parity* two dollars toda^ nave approximately tne equivalent rupee Yalue of one dollar this tiiae last yeur. To demaud two dollars this year as is suggested on a package of dates for instance wnere one dollar was demanded last year io in a tribal area wnere dollars circulate exclusively, to c&amp;uae discontent and possibly to iiiVite resistance ior naturally whoever pays Customs duties passes them on to the tricesmau* tlor is tne alternative of taking customs in rind &amp; remedy.

Rs.2,38,065-15-0, making a total of Rs.8,88,065-15-0. This amount was then divided into 14 six monthly payments of Rs.46,740-5-0 - the whole to be paid off in the 7 'years above mentioned* The Muscat State has now repaid Rs.6,54,364-6-0, a total slightly in excess of the original loan, thus the balance still due, Rs.2,33,701-9, may be taken as representing the interest which has been incurred. The State now inform us that they can continue to pay the instalments in the manner stipulated but they urge the point that so large a payment handicaps the State very considerably in the provision of the improvements which any properly managed state should show in the way of schools etc. They have then asked that in place of paying off the sum due in 2j years as now required they should be granted an additional year of grace, and that the period should be extended to 3£ years* The presence of a British adviser in the State connects us with the outward want of progress which exists and few peoplepeople would stop to consider that vre have put the finances of the State on a sound basis. The time over which the payment of the interest is spread is a matter of comparative indifference to us since we continue to receive our interest on the money expended. X think it is time that Muscat should show very distinct signs of our assistance in putting her finances in order. I would then recommend that the payment now due should be spread, not over a period of 3|- years as requested, but over a period of 5 years. This would reduce the annual payment of Rs.93,480-10-0 per annum, undoubtedly a strain on a State with a total income of Rs.10,60 ,000 # especially taking into consideration the heavy fall in the value of the Dollar. My suggestion would make the annual payment to Rs.46,740-5- an amount which could be paid without difficulty and it would leave half a lakh of rupees per annum for' the public works, schools, etc., which are so much required. I would, at the ul same time, ask whether the I'inanc^ authorities would not consider the question of a reduction in the rate of interest. The loan was made at a time of considerable financial stringency in the world at large, and the 6# agreed upon was a generous rate. Would it not be possible to-day to consider a reduction to 5^ ? We have no desire to make more than a Bank rate out of an impoverished State.Confidential* Copy of a letter Uo. K/73, dated the 24th August 1927, from the Political.

I have the honour to forward, herewith, for consideration a request from the Council of Ministers, Muscat State, to repay the balance of the loan which the state has received from the Government of India in 3^ years instead of 2^ years. It is proposed to utilise the balance which would then be made available for the purpose of opening a Government school at Muscat.

My six monthly pin^ncial Report submitted to you/ yesterday shows that the repayment by the State of Rs .93480-10 per annum, has, in the light of a falling dollar exchange, represented a growing burden. This liability the State has regularly met, and if necessary can continue to meet until the loan is liquidated, as on tnis basis it will be liquidated, in December 1929. But the strain it imposes is obvious (a) a very rigid and parsimonious financial control has to be constantly exercised (b) there is no scope for tne most insistent and elementary reforms such as for instance a Sub-Assistant Surgeon for the small pox infested Batinah or for Gwadur which supplies •* the State with a considerable portion of its revenues and gets nothing in return. Today any reform whatsoever involving expenditure must be eschewed, and under present arrangements, relief will come only in two and a half years. iii. The most compelling need of the State, as envisaged by . the Council of ministers and by the leading notables is a Primary School for Muscat. I have been approached on all hands during the past two and a half years to institute' such a school but i have been prevented from doing so by financial exigencies and the supreme, consideration of a Solvent State. There is as you know no sohool, certainly no Government school such as is found in other Arab states, through the length and breadth of tne land, iiis Highness the Sultan has this matter very much at heart and requested me to interview prospective teacher candidates recommended by Ministry of Education, Baghdad, during my forthcoming visit there. Apart from the: r v ■ u. moral value of a school to the youth of muscat and Matrah the advantage, to put the matter on no higher a plane, to future State Administration is obvious; for the standard of knowledge and literacy amongst walis and Clerks in the districts, is deplorably low* iv. in order to secure the means for proceeding at once with a school, I beg to submit for your consideration the proposal that the State may be allowed to repay the loan balance out standing spread in six monthly instalments over a period of years instead of 2^ years as at present arranged* This proposal, vide paragraph 1, is that instead of five six monthly instalments of Rs.46740-5-0, seven six monthly instal ments of Rs.33385-15 may be*substituted. The slight concession involved of a year’s interest on two small final instalments would be of great assistance, although if no remission of such interest can be allowed, it is requested the present balance plus interest may be spread over the longer period* i have, etc., 8d/- B.

The stiitexaent tnat the rule of succession is by right of election seezos to sie to be based ori^inisconception and is not borne out historically. According to the tenets of tne Ibadhi sect*their religions head is elected! but the gradual modification in the system of eiect- -ion which had tajcen pylace during tne Yaarabah dynastyt appears to have weakened tixe power and spiritual control over the country which former Imams had exercised. The contests for the succession gave oirth tf) the Hina»vi and Ghafiri factions • a source of anarchy which fcot^p of the later rulers of Oman have been able to suppress and very few to control. In 1737,the Imam Seif bin Sultan,finding himself hard pressed oy a competitor^sought the aid of the Persians who soon overran the whole of Oman. Paced by a common danger,the Omanis elected a strong man,Ahmed bin daid, the founder of the present dynasty as Imam. On his death in 17d3,the elective system once more proved ineffective when Said bin /aimed was chosen chiefly because of his weaicness and imbecility. Since 1704,tne rulers of Oman have derived their authority through tne support of one or other of the two political factions, Hinawi or Ghafiri,obtained by bribery or other causes.They have never exercised effective control over the whole country now have they assumed the title of Imam which is recognized as a religious and eiec« •tive dignity. The rule of succession may therefore be said to be by force of arms rather than by election.

In view of the falling revenues for past years the estimates for Customs receipts for this year appear optimistic. Hopes based on better rain in the Batinah have proved illusory in the past. However, the pearl catch of Bahrain and Dubai in 1928 brought distinctly better prices and the consequent increase of ready money throughout the Gulf may have have a welcome reaction in Muscat by increasing the price of Muscat products, viz.dates, firewood and tobacco. This should have a beneficial effect on the Stated Customs Revenue. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter 59 I have etc., Sd. C.C.J.Barrett, Lt.

Sir, I have theponour to forward, herewith, for the information and approval of the Hon*hie the Political Resident, the Muscat State hudg’et for 1929.

Although this yea^s estimates are in excess of last years’ actuals, the Finance Minister has every hope that his expectations will he realized in view of the fact that the figures for the first three months this year show an excess of Fs. 20000/- over the actuals of the corresponding period last year. It is proposed to purchase a one ton lorry for the Muscat Infantry. This will he invaluable for the road construction work which the Infantry are carrying out and incidentally Captain Walker anticipates to effect a saving hy its introduction as he will he able to dispense with a number of camels in use at present whose upkeep and replacement is a sonawhat heavy item.2a- - m The budget also provides for the dry docking and re fitting of the 'Al Said” launch T/vhich is at present in the R.I.M.Dockyard,Bombay, for this purpose.
