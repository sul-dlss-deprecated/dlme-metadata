As I explained to you on the telephone, for over six months., regular air mail communications between the Company^ Bahrein and New York Offices have been transitting Lagos. The Chief Censor there has been picking out such communications and handing them over to the American Consul-G-eneral for forwarding in his Bag. The despatch of this correspondence by Bag from the Persian Gulk to* London and thence, again by Bag, to New York should not delay it unduly. In any case it would seem of greater importance for it to go by the safest route. We should be most grateful for your co-operation in this matter. Yours sincerely p.p. I.H, A. J.

W. 1. 2nd March, 1 943- Dear Miss Heywood, % Thank you for your letter reference IEWH/3-EN/MMC of 26th. 5V ‘uary. As agreed, I now return to you the Bahrein Petroleum Co. correspondence. The reasons you put forward for this correspondence being carried by bag seem to me to be good ones, and I have consulted the Department of the Foreign Office concerned. I think it most probable that the Foreign Office would agree to despatch the correspon dence by Foreign Office bag from London to New York, but the India Office would have to be asked first to carry it from Bahrein to London. If, therefore, you will let me know when you have approached and obtained the consent of the India Office for the first part of the journ ey, I think there should be no difficulty in arranging the second part. Yours sincerely. Miss Heywood, I. R.B. (agd) P. &amp; T,Censorship. A. J.
