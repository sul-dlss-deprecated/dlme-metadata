Letter Ho.207-3 of the 17th March 1939 to the Secretary to the Government of India, external Affairs Department New Delhi. British Policy on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf.V« I shall shortly bs retiring from iay prsssot post I thin* It would be ussful if X put an rsc^rd my risws on some of ths sidsr aspects of our policy on the Arab side of the Persian aulf. 2. In a recent letter (Title my letter $o«2?3-l t dated the 2 drd day 193d) X expressed some doubt as to whether it was generally realised hot economical our adminietrat ion on the \rab side *as in conperieon with the important interests involved. But this statement leads naturally to a cone ids ra ti on as to why we are able to implement our responsibilities at auoh little eost 9 and I thin* the main factor is that on the whole *e possess the good-will of the Arab Kulera and their peoples. &gt;ne reason for their attitude la that as far as possible we let them alone to manage their own affaire in their own way, and being human they much prefer to mismanage these t hens elves rather than have then efficiently managed by us. When by the discovery of oil in one of the Dt&amp;tes, e.g.Bahrain, there are sufficient funds fer progress, we do not proosed to harry and hustls ths ?:uler and hla people towards •efficiency*, but content ourselves with providing taew with experts to draw up simple plans, whicn the local government own put into force themselves, with advice, and generally *?ea*i*g with friendly guidance. jJven when they de / net sir Aubrey Metcalfe, X01*. •'X9I. 9 IIY&lt;X,, Secretary to the dovornment of India, Sxternal \ffairs iepartmsut, lew Jslai.not folio* our advico, providod it io not on m. or i*» a « *0 make no attempt to force it do*n tfteir tnroetB. 2 $neily we try to carry out a policy bated on the modern 0i ••indireof* rather than the older onee of ‘’direct’* rule. 3 . 4 eecond reason for the good-will in question is that in our negotiations with the iulers, over oil, air facilities ani what not, we give them a square deal* *e carry a money instead of a thick stick and are prepared to talk instead of t o threaten, this method costs some money, and takes time, but in the ena we get what we want, and with no soreness left behind. This does not imply that our policy is a weak one* in any really serious differences of opinion between tne states and ourselves, for example with regard to breaches of their Treatieo with us, we are of course prepared to take a firm line, and as you are aware on various occasions I have sugeissted taking drastic action, ’•he threat, however, ef this drastic action has hitherto been sufficient to achieve our purpose, ani for the last ten years or so we have been able to obtain our objects on the Arab side, and to enforce the implementing of our treaties, without firing a gun or dropping a bomb. 4. The third and most important reason for tae good-will of the Arab States is that they regard His Majesty*! Government as their natural protector both within the four corners of o.ir Treaty obligations, and outside them* This in my opinion is the outstanding and permanent factor whicn in all important issues is at the back ef the minds ef the 1 ulers and their people, and its local importance cannot be over-estimated. The Arab States have their differences with His Majesty's Government, and on occasions X daresay they find us rather a nuisance, in connection / withiiarery for •xaiaplt* At tin tawe tlm« ta^-' icnow perfectly j»« 11 tnat it is only His MaJ^ty* s aovsrmAsnt who stand between them and absorption by Ibn HaJd, Iraq or Persia, and would naturally much prefer to regain as they are free and independent under their own Shaikhs, and under our protection, than for the. r States to become mere districts of Saudi Arabia, or Iraq or Iran, with their preeent Rulere replaced by oppress ire Saudi, Iraqi or Iranian offioiale. It ie this consideration, more than any other tingle factor, which enables m to •run* the day-to-day administra tion of the Arab aide with a handful of officiale (one Peeident, and three Political Agents), without the payment of a eingle rupee of eubsidy, or the upkeep (on our part) of a tingle soldier, policeman, or levy, which has a distinct and salutary effect on the rsinde of any particular shaikh and his people when on any particular occasion our interests temporarily clash, and which in any serious emergency, such as a major war which so nearly caae upon ue last September, would be of incalculable value. 5. There is in fact no doubt as to the existence of the good-will of the ^rab States, but we must not fall into the bad habit - if I may pot it that way - of taking this feeling for granted, or of assuming that it will always oontinue irrespective of what we do or do not do, particularly in regard to the matter of protection by His ajesty* s dovsrruaent. If a feeling were ever to grow up in the Arab states that His Hajesty’s Government were Inclined to take their responsibilities in this matter too lightly the effect would be moat unfortunate, and to speak frankly there have been occasions of late years when it hat seemed to me that a line of policy suggested by Hie Majesty’s Government would - if carried out - have given this Imprsesion to the local iulereand taair peoples, Some years instance# Kis -iajesty's aoverosent in order to assist the Iraq Oorernraent in the matter of checking smuggling from {await 9 though it was com a on ground that Juridically this was a matter for the Iraq dovarnmeat to deal with# were in favour of bringing 'preeeure* to be*r on the shaikh in order to induce him to co-operate with the Iraqi authorities, I was strongly oppossd to this suggestion# in which I had ths support of ths horernment of Inuia# and finally for *pres 8 urt* was substituted * advice*. Recently ale o the suggestion by ths yoreign Office on the subject of the sale of Kher al Meid to ibn Baud appeared to me# ae to tne India Office and the Ocvernment of India, to be open to serious objections, on the other hand the firm line t&amp;'cen lately by His Majesty's Government in the matter of hostile Iraqi propaganda against V own It has had an excellent effect, not only at {await but else where on the Arab side of tne Gulf. 6 . /hen it has been suggested - in cases such as above - that 'pressure* should be applied to the Rulers of the Arab States to take some particular course of action, among the arguments adduced nave been those of 'the wider issues involved' either in peace or in tae event of a major war. Whatever validity the 'wider issue* argument may have held in the past it has in my opinion little to-day. The Arab side of the Gulf, a link on the Imperial Air Route to India and beyond, and the sits of a number of oil-fields potential as well as actual# is a wide enough issue to compete successfully with most other issues in this part of ths world# both from the peace and the war point of view# while the recent 'discovery* of a possible alterna tive military motor route from tne head of the Gulf to the Mediter ranean via Kuwait and /vmman has added to its strategical import-Q&gt; 7 . Valuable a« has be«n ths gooh-wllX of ths Arab states in ths past it will, in my opinion, ba still aors valuable ths futurs. Ths wholo of the Arab aids is changing# aim with sxtraordinary rapidity. In the last ten years from a oj± i« S££ it has become an internetional highway of the first importance. Oil-fields are epringing up. Into certain of the Arab states money is pooring in, and in all of them new ideas are fermenting. Two recent movements at SUwait and Dubai are significant cases in point. \ ftw years ago these movements would have ta**n the form of an attempt, whether successful or not, of a rival to put him self in the position of ths Shaikh, nowadays, however, these movements took the democratic form of tne people in genei al getting more power into their own hands. There is much in my personal opinion that is healthy in these movements, fend in any case whether XIxe them or not we must maxe tne beat of them since under modern conditions they are inevitable. But tney will equally inevitably bring in their train difficulties of the sa»« nature with which *e have been only too familiar elsewhere, in India and \gypt, for example, to compare very large States to very small ones. There has recently been agitation in Bahrain accompanied by minor labour troiblee in the oil-field, ana b^th there and in Kuwait Youth Movements have arieen. Neither the labour troubles nor the Youth Movement are ae yet serious, but (and this is a factor wnich must not be ignored merely because it is a truism) with every year that passes the youths are growing into young men, exercising more and more influence in the States, while behind them more am more boyo are following in their footsteps. )f the young Bahraini in a recent letter height man wrot et / •Increased*Incr«a#«d «duoatlonal faeilltita in rncent yearn r*a*e produced a olaee of yount men with a Teueer of education who respond readily to press propaganda* listen to broad- oasts and develop political feelings. They believe them selves to be progressive and despise their illiterate parents who, since tne youths are earning quite good wages* have lost all influence over theia. They are nationalistio* especially since they see foreigners earning more money than they themeeivea do. They .mow that they are better educated than the ruling family and are inclined tnerefore to despise them. fhey come mainly from Uanamah and Huharraq* and most of them wor* with the Oil Qompany* in Government offioee and with firms in ^anamah. * atht at is mutandis this is an exaot description of a large number of young Indians * Egyptians* Palestinians* and Iraqis* 6 . Briefly then the old patriarchal conditions of life in tne Arab States* whether for good or ill* are being browen up* ae they have been in so many other Asiatic countries* but even more rapidly* and with this break up will come the inevitable consequen ces already Indicated. Gome of the local agitations and movements will be directed against the local Hulers* but some will certainly be directed against us, in fact is already being directed against us. Hardly a fortnight passes without an attach eeiug made in the Arab Press of Iraq* Palestine* hyria* or 2 gypt, against dim Majesty's Government and its policy towaras the Arab Gt&amp;tes of the Gulf. Jhder the convenient term of 'colonisation* accusations are eometiaes brought that it is our policy to disunite the Wmt ttates* and on other occasions to unite theuu in each case forour 04 B nofariouo «nd«| tdat wo uodorraino tho tndopwdonco of too States, and use our influence to favour our subjects and fore*tfners generally to t&amp;e detriment of the local APatof and ao forth and ao on. it ia all vagua and unsubstantial, and at prsasnt doss not perhaps cut muon ice, but then a large proportion of anti-British propaganda all over the world is of ths tame foraleae oharaotsr ehich doss not prevsnt it from having consider**ole effect. 9 . I foresee therefore difficult years ansad of us in the Arab states our policy towards which will have to be moot carefully conducted, and the first step towards this object ie a rsalieation by all ths authorities concerned with ths Otulf of ths change that has taicen place in these states. It ie no longer a case of more or leas compliant Shat aha ruling over mare or lese euomisslve peoples, tucKed a«ay in an obscure comer of tae world. *he compliancy of tne ShaUcns can no longer ae taaen for grained on all occasions, and in reply to a threat of 'pressure 4 - ae I point ed out in tne case of the 3hai*h of Cuvait quoted In paragraph 5 they above -/are quite capable of taking a firm stand. In which case since Kia Majesty’s (Jorernaent are - quite rightly - opposed to certain drastic measures which certain other Qoverrottents would not hesitate to adopt the threat loses much of its potency. But even supposing the 3hel*hs are prepared to yield to Hie Majesty's dovsrnaent there are now their people who in all of the states are acquiring more power through the force of public opinion, who in eome of the states have already acquired regularly constituted aounoile, and who in the majority of the Btatee in my opinion will in the course of the next few years obtain aimilfcr institutions. (Much the same movement ia going on to-day in the Indian states.) It Is therefore no longer merely a question of wringing a reluctant consent from a auler to our proposals, but of carsful considerationof #hat tno affect of oar propooaio may on him p«opi«. w ciooa too pictirt atop taere. Beyond the Gulf ie the Ajrab eorld which in thene dayo taxes a definite interest in Gulf affaire, (ion Baud displayed coneiderable interest for example in the recent anti-Tuwait Iraqi propaganda and actually propoee^ inter- reninB &lt;&gt;n oenalf of Kuwait), and in whicn His Majesty* e Government hare important interests in iiaudi Arabia, Iraq, yules tine and 'NJgypt. \ny steps we taice locally therefore hare their reper- cuseions, for good or otherwise, in those countries* In view of all these considerations -pressure-policy* is in my opinion a two-edged weapon, and before using it in any particular case His Majesty’s Government should reflect most carefully whether they are prepared to face a ’show-down* on the part of the ulere and tnetr peoples, with the attendant reperouseions in the Gulf and outside it* There is the further important consideration that in the difficult times ahead of us our chief instay will be the feeling in the *rab Btates that His Kajeaty’s Government stand between them and absorption by their neighbours, and anything which weakens this feeling will add considerably to our difficulties* 10* To sum upt (a) our ’rule* over the Arab Gtates of the Gulf rests on the good-will of the Rulers and their peoples, partly self- interested good-will no doubt, but none the lese firm for that reaeont the beet basis for good-will is not sentiment but self- interest* This good-will enables our day-to-day administration to be carried on economically, worxs in our favour whenever a difference in opinion arises between the atates and cure elves, and in case of an emergency, such as a major war wnich was so nearly upon us last 3eptem3er, would be of great value. / (»&gt;SESSMHMMS mmm mmmmm -9- (b) This gooa«#lll depends on tnroe afein factors* First - ths fact toat as far as poeslbls #« 1 st tns Kulsrs and tusir psopX « 9 unasr oar guidance aua adrios 9 manats tiisir o^n affairs in tiitir osn way* fsound - tiis fact tnat in our v&amp;rloas ne^otiat- ions with ths Valors, in which of cours* thsir peoples art interest ed, on the subject of oil, air facilities and so forth, we give them a patient hearing and a square deal* Third • and aoet important - tne iulers and their peoples realise tuat it ie only His Majesty's Governiaent wno protect them from absorption oy their stronger neighbours* (e) Owing to modern democratic developments in the States there are difficult times ahead of us, and we must be careful, all the nore so because of the much increased strategical and political importance of the Arab side in recent years, to continue in the future the main lines of oar policy which have served us well in the past* Above *11 we must avoid t&amp;icirjg any step which &lt;oula lessen the confidence which at present tne states have in lie Majesty 1 e Govermaent as their natural protector. a copy of this letter to leel* Yours sincerely, sd.

Since the conclusion of our first engagement with Muscat State in 1798 which was expreslly designed to exclude the French from obtaining a foothold there 9 it has been our policy to maintain an Independent State over which we kept a certain measure of control consistent with enduring that Muscat did not become a potential source of danger to our control of the Persian Gulf and other saa routes• In 1862 wa concluded an agreement with Fiance whereby both parties undertook to respect the independence of the State* * 7* Our policy from 1798 to the present day can roughly speaking ba divided into three stages* (a) * Non interference in internal affairs and recognition of the de facte ruler* (b) . Support of a particular contestant* (c) * The Partition and afterwards* 8 * Non-interference in internal affairs* In 1866 one Saiyid Salim seized the Sultanate and waa suspected of having resorted to patricide in so doing* At first we refused to recognise him on the grounds thst we had no wish to interfere in tlie domestic affairs of Muscat. At the sami time we demanded from him fulfilment of all treaty obligations. Eventually 9 s fsw months later 9 we did recognise him as he was apparently acceptable to the tribes* In the Same year we warned off Saiyid Turk! who had been residing at Bush ire on an allow^mce granted to him by the British Government when he made an abortive attack on Muscat* He was told that similar proceedings in the future would expose him and his suppox'ters to bei^g treated as enemies of the British Government* In 1869 izzan bin Qais took Muscat and we refused to help the Sultan Saiyid Salim who had lost the support of the tribes by his policy* 9* Support of a particular contestant* In 1869 in complete reversal of our former warning to Saiyid Turk!, we told him that he might interfere in the affairs of Oman other than by a sea attack* Ha evantually seized power and in 1871*hen he was securely established we accorded him formal recognition* In 1886, it was declared publicly by the British Government that we intended affording Saiyid Turk! active support in case of attack on Muscat or Matrah which had the salutary effect of maintaining peace during the remainder of his life* In 1896 the Sultan notified the leading Shaikhs of Oman of the decision of the British Government that in view of the important British interests in Muscat and Matrah they would not permit anattack on these towns whatever differences the Shaikhs :night have with the Spltferu This warning wns reiterated in 1913. 10. The Partition. The year 1913 eaw the first signs of the discontent amongst the tribes which led up to their attack on the British troops who had been lanuoa for the defence of Muscat and Matrah y their eoaapleta defeat, and culminated in the famous Treaty of Sib in 1920. •»&gt;* Before considering the terms of this treaty it is of interest to stddy extracts of some of the Administration Reports of this period. * r Tne movement, though partly d to to the objection of the Hinawis to the present branch of the A1 Bu Said family, is also due to throe generations of had r*ile. Thid condition of affairs the present Sultan (Saiyid Taimur who eventually abdicated) show# no signs of desiring to improve. The Omanis and the people on the coast hold the British Government responsible for the bad rule since, so they say, if it were not for their support they would not be obliged to undergo it. Tho Sultan is now so abaalutaly dependent on us that an unvarnished exposition of the situation to him would leave him no Iteraative but to reform, were that made a condition of our continued support. * 0 wing to the lack of officials rafarred to elsewhere, tliere would appear to be no alternative to the employment of trained British officials in the reorganisation of the system. H 'It was realised that a settlement on the basis oi the status quo was the only possible solution, and should settlement on these lines be possible, an eaa of comparative prosperity should dawn. The coast will develops and the Interior cen look after itself. Ro agreonasnt would be binding on the Bedou of the interior for the simple reason that they do not know the meaning of an agreement. Force me Jure la all they understand. To strengthen the Sultan's hands, to enable him to rule the coast line efficiently end to stand by himself, and to discourage him from interesting himself in Vie interior is a clear policy to pursue.' 192Q . 'The imposition of a dakat of 25* on all dates coming to the coast from tho intarior forced the tribesmen to come to tarma at last but not:before the Imam had been murdered in expression of the general discontentment prevailing. Skfclkh Isa however packed the election and hia father in law was elected the new Imam. The more important terms of the treaty of Sib negotiated by Mr. Wingate, as mediator between the Sultan and the rebels, and Shaikh Iss on behalf of tne Imam were as follows: On behalf of the Sultan Not to interfere in the internal affairs of Oman.4 - On btbclf 9t tbt Omonie \ HtaiAin in p«ac« with tht Sulttn *nd net t# etteck th# ceagt line er interfere vith the tffeire ef his Government. Ihe following ie on extract irem the Administration Report of 1920. 'The Sultan's Gevorn.nont hove little to fear as the power of the Onanio, should it be directed against him, will automatically become loss os the reform of the burton's adminiatratian progresses and its strength increases•' In 1919 Captain McCollum was appointed Brition Adviser but 'in 1920 the situation caused by the attitude of tne Sultan (Saiyid T^imur.....desire to sbdicste) and his continued absence in Inai&amp;i events in the interior; and &amp;b©ve all the fact that the British Adviser h#d bean able to do sufficient in the way of reform tf&gt; justify th* obviously desiraole experiment bsir^- made e.. le eying the ft etc in erUrely Arab hands, nee rendered hi* further employment unnecessary and inadvisable. Ke therefore left.” !!• At this stage I would like to mar.e one or two cements. The world has had smple eppertvmity during the course af this century to study the practice and affect of the partition of territories. At the best ef times it is an extiemely difficult problem and one portion will inevitabJy claim that it has been deprived of somothing etf ether vital to its existence. The Sultan's Government (if it had shewn any interest in the matter) would have been justified in complaining that it had bean left vdtfe a coast line on which the nen-Arab papulation was largsly predeminsnt. In Matrah, for instance, it is ths exception rather than the rule to see an Arab Bedeu. Thera was a great dearth ef ability before the partition and with tne State's restricted source ef manpower after the Treaty ef Sib I do net quite see hew it wee expected to fina :nen for 'ths efficient administration ef the territory' unless they were to be brought in from outside. If that was the intention, the few officials who have acted as Financial Advisers were net expected to raise the whole standard of administration. In effect we have helped in creating a housa divided against itself. The Muscat portion is laughed at by outsiders, gives vai*ious Political Agents grey hairs when trying to obtain satisfacti.on from the so-called Ministers (the Sultan invariably being comfortably a*c*nsed in Dhefar where it is difficult to get at him), and inf3.lets enermena trials and tribulations on the wretched subjects through its complete inability to run even a semblance of good government. 12. From 1920 until he finally succeeded id abdicating in 1932 Saiyid Talmur made consistent attempts to do so. His desire to wash his hands of the new State can largely be attributed to an unwillingness to accept its responsibilities und to his preferment of a life of ease and pleacuref it is unlikely that the part*.tiening ef his territory was the Immediate cause* His successor, Saiyid Said,spends increasingly mere and mere ef his time in Dhefar and, to all outward appearances at aqy rats, is content to leave the Gtato in the hands ef his uncle whom he has hlmsslf described as a very stupid man and one without any influence amongst the tribes* He has himself admitted that he can see no fit ore for jus cot unaer present conditions*6 13 • Tim fufcura of nr it i B h rolloy . «r« only two nitarnati/as (•) to allow and onouraga tho rjraaont ^nodaa vi/andl (b) incraaaad intarfaranca In tha administration* 14.

You will remember that at the meeting at the India Office on 4th August the question was raised of the position of the pro tected Arab sheikdoms in the Persian Gulf in respect &gt; ef cabotage (vide paragraph 3 (9) of the minutes of the meeting). This matter was. as promised, taken up with the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry and as a result the following phrase has been proposed for inclusion in the definition in any international convention of the territories to which cabotage should apply: 'territories under the protection, jurisdiction cr authority of the contracting parties'. 2. It has been carefully considered from the legal point of view whether, in order t© safeguard the United Kingdom 1 S cabotage rights in the Arab sheikdoms it would be better to rely on the term 'protectorate' as used in the existing Paris Air Convention or whether it would be safer to employ some new phrase. The distinct ion between a protectorate and a protected state is largely one v which we ourselves have made for our own constitutional purposes, a protectorate being a territory which has not got a local sovereign but which is at the same time net administered by us as an ordinary colony; whereas a protected state has its cwn native sovereign. In international law, however, there does not appear to be any distinction between a protectorate and a protected state; indeed, the term 'protectorate' is mainly used with reference to what we should call a protected state. There is no doubt that the French term 'protect©rat' would cover a protected state. Therefore, unless it appeared on investigation that in practice protected states such as the Arab sheikdoms had not been regarded as coming within the term 'protectorate' for the purposes of the Paris Con vention, it would be sufficient to rely on this term as covering them and therefore, in any new convention, simply to repeat the phraseology of the old one. To adopt this course might enable the Arab Sheikdoms to be covered without the issue being actually raised. 3. Nevertheless, our inclination, subject to the views of the Government of India, is that it is better to come into the open, as it is probable that the issue will be raised in any event. It is conceivable that the Americans may object to a French terri tories in the Far East. It is by no means impossible that they may adopt a similar attitude in regard to British protected states under the aegis of the Colonial Office, such as Zanzibar and the Malay States, to say nothing of Dutch territories in a similar position in the Far East. Therefore, if the issue is likely tc emerge in a wider field at the forthcoming international conference, there will be no particular point in adhering tc the term 'protectorate' if a a better phraseology can be found. The fact that the term 'protect orate' does cover a protected State, as a matter of international law, does not, of course, mean that for the purposes of Treaty defin ition there may not be some phrase v/hich would be preferable. The term in common use in treaties to which His Majesty's Government is a party is 'territories under the protection (of the contracting parties)'. The Americans like to use the term 'Jurisdiction' to refer to territories of theirs in a somewhat similar position to our protected states and the Dutch similarly tend to apply the term 'authority'. It is with these considerations in mind that we put : forward the phrase suggested in paragraph 1 above. 4 , I am sending a copy of this ietter to the Indian Agency- General , Washington• Sir Gununath Bewoor, C.I.E.?

My dear Sir Geoffrey, Please refer to the correspondence ending with foreign telegram No. 634 dated the 21st January, 1946. On the 27th February the B.B.C. announced that the General Secretary of the Arab League, Abdul Rahman Azzam Pasha, talking to a news agency about the League’s aims, declared that the question of representing the small Arab Amirates of the Persian Gulf in the League has not been looked into though 60 Egyptian teachers were sent there to educate the sons of Bahrain and Kuwait• 3. It appears that the Egyptians do not regard the deputation of a number of Egyptian teachers to Bahrain purely as an educational measure, but that they also regard the matter in a political light. Besides this it is interesting to see into what detail the General Secretary has gp ne in his probings. Yours sincerely, Sd. A.C. GALi 0WAY. The Hon’ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C. I.E.

Sir 9 I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a memorandum by Brigadier Clayton on a conver &gt;ation with AJUSayed Taufiq Suwaidi, Prime Minister of Iraq, and iil- Sayed Tahsin al-Askari, Iraqi Minister in Cairo. 2. It will be noticed that the Iraqi Prime Minister supports total evacuation of ^gypt, with facilities, and suggests that it would be enough if we had our troops in Palestine, while each Middle Eastern country would maintain their military contribution in their own country towards regional security. 3. Paragraphs &amp; and 6 of the enclosed memorandum are rather disquieting and possibly reflect Azzam Pasha's ubiquitous and restless Arab ism. It is to be hoped that the Arab League will abstain from intrigues in Persian Arab is tan, the result of which might be to involve the Persian Government in difficulties in the south while it it is involved in similar difficulties in the north. 4. With regard to paragraph 6, it is presumed that Persian claims to Bahrain would be supported by the Russians, riven if it is difficult for us to impose a veto on any cultural and economic participation of the Gulf States in the Arab League, it would seem inadvisable to encourage anything like that for the time being. Ibn Baud's interest in the Gulf States might well be inconveniently stimulated by any such development. I have the honour to be With the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant 3d. Ronald Campbell. , The Right Honourable rimest Bevin, M.P. , m.r., foreign Office, London, S.W.l. / RHL,Sir Walter Smart iilxt. 3515/46 P Taufiq Suwaldi asicsd me t o go and see him tala mo m i ng • &gt; He began by speculating on Rua^ian intentions at U.tf.Q. and in liorth Persia but as these are unpredictable by anyone he abandoned the topic and asked me what the situation was like in jfigypt# 1 replied that it was rather difficult and said he must have heard a good deal about it from Egyptian sources. He said that he had been told that Sidky was hopeful of a 'good issue' • I asked what he meant and he said that he understood it to mean a satisfactory treaty of alliance with Great Britain 'with facilities' but on a basis of complete evacuation of British troops from Egyptian 3pil« I did not ask him what he meant by 'facilities' but asked if he meant that all troops would have to leave. He said Yeo. I asked him what he meant by 'all troops’* and he merely repeated the phrase and implied later, when talking of Arab countries in general, that this did not necessarily include some staff and technicians. I did not pursue the subject and he switched to the idea of regional def ence. 2. He asked me what 1 thought would be the better set up of the world security arrangements? would taey be on a regional basis or would states subscribing be liable for contributions anywhere, 1 said that his guess was as good as mine, but I thought the obvious method was to arrange it on a regional basis* He remarked thut that ought to be quite possible in the Middle East. Any forces that the British Government felt that they had to contribute might conveniently be in Palestine provided that we were charged with the trusteeship, while each M.£. country would maintain their contribution in their ov/n country. He then, hinting at Iraq, asked if the maintenance of airfields would be necessary. 1 said they surely would and with them some technical arrangements, radar, etc. He agreed. 3. He asked if ports would be necessary. I said that fleets could not operate without them so that, presumably, if M.S. countries wanted naval protection they would have to provide port facilities. 4. Speaking of E^ypt he said that the difficulties arose because the leaders had not the courage to stand up to their people and explain matters. The «afd, the Ikhwan, the Students 1 Committees were all demagogic and unprincipled and forced the pace without any regard to essential factors. / 5. Tahsin al Aakari then came into the room and they said that the Arab League had received a request from people in Arabistan asking for their help against the Persians. What were they to do? Could they not give some assurances or even admit them to the League in some way? I said that, speaking personally, I thought the League (and the world generally] had quite enough problems on their hands already without raising another. Inany case any action in the sense they suggested would only give Russia a chance to exert increased pressure on Persia and would be interpreted by them as aggressive action. They suggested that Arabistan might also do the same as Azerbaijan, but I said I thought at present it was in their interests to refrain from adding to Persia's difficulties. I suspect though that the League may well give some encouraging answer to the petitioners even if it is only to say that they sympathise with them. 6. They then raised the question of the Gulf States and Muscat. They were afraid that the Persian claim to / thethe former mighty at Russian instigation, he pressed* Could the League not inrite them to Join? They thought they would be quite ready to but they wanted to know *8 view* If HlfG had no objection they would like to start the ball rolling - probably on a cultural and economic basis to begin with* They asked me if I could get the views of H.M*G* on the subject* 1 said I would see if it were possible for HMG to be sounded* It seems to me that there is something to be said for the idea, especially as nobody knows what is going to be the outcome of negotiations in India* I do not quite know what was Taufiq # s idea in asking me to see him* I think he hoped I should be able to give him some firm news about Russia’s intentions (which I couldn’t), as except for an interlude on 4gypt the whole talk was on Persia and Russia* flj 3d. 1*11.0 Layton 29 ^ 3 . 46 .

There have, I think, so far been no indications of a desire on the part of any of tue Arab States of the Persian Gulf or of Muscat, to Joint the Arab League and, as Sir Ronald Campbell suggests in his Despatch, it seems to us most undesirable to do anything to encourage such a development. Our Imperial interests in these States, *hioh include the security of the air route to the iSast and the largely \inexplci4ttd oil resources which they contain, demand that they should be encouraged to look only to H.M.G. and, so long as she remains within the Commonwealth, to India to whom indeed they mainly owe such independence as they enjoy.
