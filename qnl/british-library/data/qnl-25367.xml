Section 2 . [7021 No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office. —{Received February 13.) gj r India Office, February 12, 1913. ’ I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 27th January and 7th February regarding a proposal that the Governor-General of Kerman should be supplied with money by His Majesty s Govern ment for the restoration of order in that province. # } In reply, I am to say that the Marquess of Crewe is of opinion that His Majesty’s Government should carefully consider their financial policy as a whole in Southern Persia before committing themselves further to a system of doles, of which it is difficult to see the end. As Sir E. Grey is aware the expenditure of Indian revenues in Persia has in the past been regarded by the Secretary of State in Council^ with great misgivings, to which forcible expression was given by d iscount Moiley in this office letter of the 11th December, 1909. The circumstances at the time were, it is true, somewhat different, but the principle is one to which Lord Crewe attaches no less importance than did his predecessor. His Lordship recognises that special conditions may arise, as they have in fact arisen in the province of Fars, in which a reasonable expenditure of Indian revenues at a given moment may avert the necessity of greater expenditure from the same source at a later date. But he feels that such outlay can only be justified in very exceptional circumstances, and he is most reluctant to contemplate any further advances such as that sanctioned in the case of Fars, unless based upon a considered programme framed with a view less to the requirements of Persia than to the interests and revenues of India. * r- r i o i It would further appear from Sir W. Townley’s telegram ho. 4/ ol the 2nd February, 1913, regarding the Fars loan, to be very questionable how far such a dole as is suggested m your letter would be welcomed by the Persian Government oi w on Id ggj.yg to any appreciable extent to ameliorate the situation in Kerman. In all the circumstances Lord Crewe considers that Sir W. Townley’s suggestion should not be entertained. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HOLDERNESS.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 12, 1914.) (No. 291.) Sir, Tehran, December 24, 1913. I AM not yet in possession of any detailed information respecting the recent operations of the gendarmerie on the Shiraz-Bushire road other than that which has been communicated to you by telegram, but there appears every reason to believe they were carried out with perfect success after the foolish behaviour of the detachment left at Kazerun, under Persian officers, had threatened to wreck the whole undertaking. Some faults would appear to have been made, and it was most unfortunate that Ali Mohamed Kamaredji was allowed to escape on the first occasion when he was surrounded in a fort, and, after a combat lasting some hours, managed to get aw'ay under cover of the night with all his followers, including women and baggage animals. It seems hard from Major O’Connor’s account of the occurrence to acquit the Swedish officer in command of all blame, since there was bright moonlight, and the fort was surrounded on all sides. On the whole, however, the Swedes carried out their work well, and it required no small amount of courage, after having had to retire to Daliki, to make good the rear which was threatened, to attack the difficult Tangi Turkan Pass with a small force, in the face of the determined opposition of the tribesmen who have gained by their prowess in the past no mean name as fighting men. That certain of the outlaws are still abroad is unfortunate, but it is hard to catch such people when they take to the mountains, and one can only hope that they will be captured in due course. Latest reports received show that the road is now open between Shiraz and Bu shire, whilst preparations are being made to put posts on the road north of Shiraz up to the frontier of the Ispahan province. The continuation of the good order established can only be maintained if the necessary funds are forthcoming, and the question where these funds are to be found will soon have to be faced, as the Persian Treasury is in no condition to supply them, and the revenue of the province, though much improved, will not be sufficient for the purpose. On the existing budget the Persian Government has to find about 25,000h in addition to the 100,0001. advanced for the purpose by His Majesty’s Government, and I understand that it is proposed to f increase the effective force from about 2,000 men to 2,700. Major O’Connor deprecates this increase as unnecessary, and I propose to represent his reasons for coming to this decision, which appear to me sound, to the general commanding. I have the honour to submit to you herewith copy of a despatch from Major O’Connor, which I have received since I commenced to write this despatch, in which, I regret to say, he reports that it has been by no means easy to induce the Swedish officer charged with the accounts to submit the same for proper control, in accordance with the arrangement made with the Persian Government when His Majesty’s Government agreed to make the advance for the service of the Pars gendarmerie. This is the general complaint against the Swedes, that they will not submit their accounts, and that their methods are extravagant. I shall speak to General Hjalmarson on the subject, and shall point out to him that it is in the interests of the gendarmerie officers themselves that they should accept the help of those who are better able than they are to prevent their being robbed by unscrupulous persons whom they may have taken into their service. It would be of great assistance to me to know whether His Majesty’s Government propose to make a further advance to the Persian Government on account of the gendarmerie of Pars at the end of the year, for which the first advance was made. In submitting this question to you, Sir, I would respectfully beg to point out that the original request of the Persian Government was for financial assistance such as would enable them to make sure of the maintenance of a suitable force in Pars for a period of three years. In recommending this matter to your favourable consideration, I [2013 m—11]2 would venture to add that the success achieved by the gendarmerie has more than come up to the most sanguine hopes of what might be expected from them in so short a time. I have not yet been approached by the Persian Governnent on the subject, but it would appear to me most important that, if it is intended to come to their helm with a fresh advance, there should be no moment when the success of the undertaking might be imperilled by uncertainty as to whether or no further funds will be forthcoming. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townlen.. (No. 418.) (Telegraphic.) ^ Shiraz, December 24, 1913. I UNDERSTAND Ears gendarmerie budget is now under preparation in Tehran. Uggla tells me that he proposes force of 2,700 men for the next financial year, present strength being 1,600. Stas and I are both of opinion that force of 2,000 men should amply suffice for the present. This should be sufficient to maintain present strength on main road from Yezdikhast to Bushire, and to leave small reserve at Shiraz for emergencies. Cost of gendarmerie during the last few months has been so heavy that I think it is desirable strength of force should be limited to maximum of about 2,0U0—at any rate until we can judge of progress likely to be made in reorganisation of local troops, &amp;c. Your Excellency would perhaps discuss this question with the general officer commanding in connection with new budget estimates.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government] I HAVE received jour despatch No. 291 of the 24th December, enquiring whether it is the intention of His Majesty’s Government to make to the Persian Government a further financial advance on account of the Ears gendarmerie force at the end of the year, for which the sum of 100,000?. was lent in May 1913. While I realise fully that the gendarmerie may be essential for the proper govern ment of Persia, it is not to be expected that the British taxpayer will continue to pay for the maintenance of the force. Before I am prepared, therefore, to consider the question of approaching His Majesty’s Treasury regarding a further outlay of 100,000?. I must have conclusive evidence to show, if necessary, that the Persian Government could not finance the scheme themselves, and that I have made every effort to induce them to fulfil their own most elementary obligations by meeting the charges on account of the maintenance of law and order out of the country’s own ’resources. If Persia continues to receive instalments of funds whenever the need arises she will never pay her own way. I accordingly request you to urge the Treasurer-General in the strongest manner to find the necessary money out of Persian revenues. As regards the difficulty experienced by the acting British consul at Shiraz in inducing the Swedish officer charged with keeping the accounts of the force to submit them for proper control, it is difficult to understand how any public official conversant with civilised methods of administration can seriously claim exemption from the universally accepted rule governing the disbursement of public moneys in all countries, a claim which is, moreover, in complete contradiction to the terms on which the advance was made, as mentioned in your telegram No. 260 of the 13th July last.

This Memorandum is intended as a short supplement to the printed departmental Memo- randum as to Persian Government Loans dated the 17th October 1910. It is not proposed to summarise the lengthy and often inconclusive correspondence that has taken place since that date regarding the indebtedness of the Persian Government, and projects like that of Messrs, feeligman for making them further loans. But when definite results have been attained, a brief description oi them is here given, so far as they have a bearing on Indian interests. T The position may first be recalled of the Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903 and 1904 as it stood in Octolier 1910. It had then been included in the general amalgamation scheme of the debts of the mpenal Bank of Persia, and its amount, with arrears, as calculated on the 21st March 1910, was 314 2SU. 16s 4d. For a period of three years’ ie., until the 20th March 1913, interest only, at 5 per cent., was to be paid in respect of it, and thereafter redemption of capital and payment of interest were ?A°JvQ? d i f ? r hy 15 equal annual instalments of onli w' coverm g the Period ending the 30th March 1928. iotm A ( l 1 Iiestion tllat came up at the end of LJK ), was that of the remuneration of the Imperial Bank of Persia lor their services in connection with the loan.- It was decided, after consultation odd! u 1S that for the three years ending the ^Oth March 1913, the Bank should retain 1 per cent, interest on the sum of 314,281k 16s 4d and that for the period 21st March 1913—20th March 1928 they should retain, each year, one-fifth of the interest portion of the annuity of 30,278k 12s. 7d A Table of Amortisation of the loan, giving* the the interest portions of the annuity for each year was prepared here (Appendix L), and forwarded to the Foreign Office. On its being represented subsequently by the Bank that the sum of 314,28U. 16s. 4d. above- mentioned included a sum of 42,2611. Os. 9d for capitalised arrears of interest, they were allowed to retain one-fifth of the latter sum, viz., 8,452k 4s. 2d during the three years ending the 20th March 1916. S. 187.2 4. An important transaction that may next he described was the issue in July 1911 by the Imperial Bank of Persia on behalf of the 1 ersian Government of a public 5 per cent. Sterling Loan of 1,250,000L The Persian Government specially assigned to this loan, subject only to the existing prior charges in respect of the Anglo-Indian Loan, the full net Customs receipts of the Persian Gulf, including those of Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Moham merah, and Ahwaz, agreeing at the same time that these receipts should be made payable direct to the Bank. In the event of the Customs receipts being insufficient, the deficiency was to be made good “ from other sources of Government revenue, and further from the telegraph receipts (subject to a prior charge on those receipts up to 1928 on account of the Anglo-Indian Loan). The loan, which was issued to the public at 96|- per cent.,! was redeem able at par at any time after 1916 after six months’ notice, and a cumulative sinking fund of one-half per cent, was to be provided in respect of it commencing in 1916, and extending over a period not exceeding 50 years. It was stated in the prospectus that “ the annual “ amount required for the service of the loan is for “ interest and for the prior charges until March “ 1913 the sum of 78,214L, and from thence until “ 1916 the sum of 92,779Z. Thereafter the annual ” amount required for interest, amortisation and “ prior charges is 99,029Z. until 1928 (when the “ prior charges cease), and onwards from that date “ the sum of 68,750L” According to the contract with the Persian Government, the Bank were authorised to pay off their own debt out of the proceeds of this loan, and to hold the remainder at the Government’s disposal. The arrangements generally were settled in communication with this Office and the Foreign Office, and a letter from the Foreign Office (Appendix II.), taking cognisance of the arrange ments and promising a measure of diplomatic support, was embodied in the prospectus.

In February 1912 after Mr. Mor gan Shuster had left Tehran, the position of affairs in Persia being extremely critical, a proposal was once morel brought forward for a joint Anglo Russian advance to the Persian Government. It was uncertain at first whether its amount would be 400,000L or 200,000b, and the Secretary of State in Council was prepared to advance from Indian revenues sums of 100,000b or 50,000b, whichever might be found necessary. Ultimately the amount of the joint advance was fixed at 200,000b, and a cheque for 50,0001., the Indian portion, was sent to the Anglo-Bussian Advance (£200,000). t Vide paragraphs 52, 53, 55 and 56 of the Memorandum, dated the 17th October 1910.

Imperial Bank ol^ Persia on the 10th February last, the conditions of the advance were laid down in a joint British and Russian Note, dated the 18th February 1912 (Appendix III.), and, briefly, were: interest at 7 per cent.,* repayment to be out of the first proceeds of a forthcoming Persian Government loan, and “ until then the surpluses of ^ the northern and southern customs’i evenues “ will be wholly and respectively assigned to the amortisation of, and to the payment of interest “ on &gt; Russian and British' portions of the present advance. The conditions were accepted by the Persian Government in a Note dated the 20th March 1912. Later, it was agreed that until the 28th March 1913 interest only should be paid on the advance, without provision for the redemption of capital. 6. As regards the Imperial Bank of Persia, it was settled that they should retain as their remuneration one-seventh of the 7 per cent, interest, i.c., 1 per cent, per annum on the loan as before (paragraph 3). 7. As already explained, 50,000F instead of 100,000/. was advanced out of Indian revenues in February. In a letter dated the 29th April the Secretary of State for India in Council expressed his readiness to advance on the same conditions as before a further sum of 25,000/. For the moment no action was taken under this authority, but in the following August, in view of the situation created by the defeat of a force of Persian gendarmerie under Swedish officers, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs caused a sum of 25,000/. to be placed by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the credit of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and applied for the refund of a moiety (12,500/.) from this Office. This was sanctioned, the amount being paid to the Bank of England, on account of the Foreign Office, on the 24th August. The conditions as regards interest and repayment were the same as in the case of the previous Anglo-Indian advance of 100 , 000 /. It may be explained that of the 25,000/. received by His Majesty’s Minister, 10,000/. were advanced to the Persian Government soon after its receipt by him, and that he instructed the Bank at Tehran on the 24th October last to pay the remainder into the account of the Persian Treasurer-General, making it clear that the money was to be used for the gendarmerie in Southern Persia. 8. In compliance with a request from the Foreign Office for a further Anglo-Indian advance to the Persian Government of 15,000/., for the use of the Governor-General at Shiraz, the Secretary of State in Oouncil, in a letter dated the 21st November 1912, consented to provide the Indian moiety (7,500/.), the advance to be in all respects on the same footing as the previous Anglo-Indian advance of 25,000/.4 The Accountant-General of this Omce paid the sum of 7,500L to the Imperial Bank of Persia to the credit of His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran on the 27tli November 1912. The unexhausted balance of the sum of 100,000/., which the Secretary of State in Council expressed himself in February last {see paragraph 5 above) as ready to advance to the Persian Government from Indian revenues is now 30,000/., (he., 100,000/., less 50,000/. + 12,500/. + 7,500/.) 9. Thus the debts of the Persian Government to His Majesty’s Government are to-day (27th November 1912)' :; - as follows :— £ s. d. (1) Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903 and 1904 (5 per cent.) - 314,281 16 4 (2) Anglo-Indian Advance of February 1912 (7 per cent.) - 100,000 0 0 (3) Anglo-Indian Advance of August 1912 (7 per cent.) - 25,000 0 0 (4) Anglo-Indian Advance of November 1912 (7 per cent.) 15,000 0 0 Total debt of the Persian Govern ment to His Majesty’s Government. (£454,282.) * The advance of November being- treated as already in the hands of the Persian Government. Total - - £454,281 16 4 Interest only on these sums has at present to be paid, but, unless the arrangements agreed on are modified, redemption of capital should begin in the case of (1) from the 21st March 1913, and in the case of (2), (3) and (4) from the 29th March 1913. If a large loan be issued hereafter for the Persian Government, the advances of February, August and November should be repaid out of the proceeds. There have been various projects for such a loan, and M. Sazonoff discussed it on his recent visits to London and Paris : the proposal that is now under consideration is that it should be arranged by the Societe d Etudes of the Trans-Persian Railway, if the financial position in Persia should be found to justify it. Another proposal also has recently been mooted Sir E. Grey's Telegram to Sir G. for arranging a loan of smaller amount under Buchanan, No. 1221, 13th November 1912. British and Russian auspices. R 43 75/12. 10. In conclusion it may be noted as a point of detail that a proposal has recently been approved after consultation with this Office to arrange for the simultaneous payment each month of the sums due from the Persian Government in respect of the Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903 and 1904, the public o per cent. Loan of 1911, and the recent advances made by His Majesty’s Government. Simultaneous monthly payments in respect of various Loans. Sir E. Grey’s Despatch to Sir W.

(£2,250,000.) * The customs of Kermanshah, it may be observed, were to be left out of account, because Her Majesty’s Government neither wished to face the risk of being called on to occupy the Kermanshah customs house, nor desired to see the Russians, on their side, in occupation of it. Telegram to Sir M. Durand, N r o. 24, 2nd August 1899. (P. 46.) Telegium from British Ambassador at St. Petersburg, No. 17, 30th January 1900. (P. 36. See also p. 43.) t The value of the rouble is slightly above 2 s. 1. The question of the indebtedness of the Persian Government falls primarily within the cognizance of the Foreign Office, but from time to time the India Office is called upon to consider it, chiefly (1) because the Secretary of State for India in Council has advanced money to the Persian Government, and (2) because the main security for the British Government loans to Persia is the customs receipts of Southern Persia, the part of the country with which India is more intimately connected. The Memorandum is intended mainly for de partmental reference, and an index has been added. 2 * * S. 2. In 1899 there was much discussion as to the necessity of financial assistance to the Persian Government. A British loan on the security of the southern customs was spoken of, with a Russian loan on the security of the customs of the Caspian Ports.Communications on the whole subject had passed between the British and Russian Govern ments, when on the 30th January 1900 the official Russian Gazette announced that the Russian Government had decided to sanction a loan to the Persian Government from the Banque des Prets of 22,500,000 roubles,| roughly 2,250,000L, on the following terms :— “ The payment of interest and of sinking fund for the extinction of the loan in 75 years is to be guaranteed by all the customs revenues of Persia, exclusive of those of Pars and the Persian Gulf Ports. “ In case of any delay in the payments of the service of the loan, for which the revenues thus pledged are at present more than sufficient, the Bank is to have the right of establishing a control of the said revenues. The Persian Government engages to extinguish all its previous external obligations with the proceeds of the new loan, and not to conclude without consent of the Bank any fresh foreign loan whatever until the loan of 1900 has been extinguished. The Persian Government grants the Bank the right of placing, if it thinks necessary, on the money market bonds of the Persian Loan proportionate to the unredeemed amount of the debt, and bearing the full guarantee of the Imperial Russian Government.” S. 19. A2 Later on, Mr. Spring-Rice reported from Tehran that a clause had been added to the Loan Contract, on the Shah’s insistence, enabling the Persian Government to pay back the debt, if they wished, after ten years. Fuller particulars as to the loan were contained in a Memorandum communicated to the Foreign Office on the 17th August .1900 by Sir T. Gordon, after a conversation with the Sadr Azam at Ostend, but a certified copy of the contract was not available until it was procured by Sir A. Hardinge from M. Nans, the Belgian head of the Customs in Persia, and sent home on the 9th December 1901. The expression used in this contract (Art. 7) as to the security of the loan is “ toutes les douanes de Perse, a Vexception de celles “ du Pars et des ports du Golfe Persique.” The loan could be paid off “ d partir du l er Janvier 1910,” on giving six months’ notice. 3. The British Ambassador at St. Petersburg protested against the conclusion of this Russian loan without the previous exchange of views that the Russian Government had promised. He was referred by the Foreign Minister, Count Mouravieff, to the Minister of Finance, M. de Witte, who maintained that the transaction had been of a financial, i.e., non-political, character and denied that the Banque des Prets was in any sense a branch of the Russian State Bank. He explained that the customs revenues from the Persian Gulf ports and the Province of Fars had been expressly excluded from the security of the loan, so as not to interfere with British interests. 4. It may here be mentioned that in 1897 the Persian Government had undertaken not to place under foreign control and supervision the customs of Southern Peisia. It had m that year come to notice that a certain oculist, Dr. *Ratoul, was arranging for a loan to the Persian Government on the_ security of the customs of the southern ports ol Peisia and of Kerman shah, and Mr. A. Hardinge demanded from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs an assurance that under no circumstances whatever will the control of the customs of Southern leisia be ceded to a foreign power” He received on the 23rd October 1897 the followino- omcial communication :— &amp; “ You have written that there was a rumour that the customs of Southern Persia would be placed under foreign supervision and control as guarantee for a loan. I therefore talie this oppor tunity of informing the Legation that this rumour is absolutely without foundation, and that they will never be placed under foreign supervision and (Signed) Musiiir-ed-Dowi.eii, , a , „ “ Minister for Foreign Affairs.” {pee para. 1 /.) 5.

(£ 200 , 000 .) to the Persian Government that, in the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, the customs of the port of Mohammerah were included in the customs of “ Southern Persia.” On instructions from Lord Salisbury Mr. Spring-Rice communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs n pro-memorid in which the following words occurred :— _ “ Lord Salisbury thinks it due to the friendship existing between the Governments of Persia and Great Britain that there should be a clear under standing of his views as to the ports of Mohammerah, Bushire, Bunder Abbas, and other ports of the Persian Gulf. This is the best way to avoid difficulties in the future. “It is not necessary to remind the Persian Government of the circumstances which make it impossible for Her Majesty’s Government to regard with indifference what happens in the ports above named. As this Legation has recently stated, the control of these ports by a foreign power might lead to a state of things which Pier Majesty’s Government, in the interests of the Indian Empire, would _ be bound to resist. And this has been recognised by the Persian Government, who, on the 23rd October 1897, gave a written promise that the customs of Southern Persia should never be placed under foreign control and supervision. “ The Persian Government did not fail to bear this promise in mind during the recent negotiations, and, as the Sadr-i-Azam has informed Her Majesty’s Legation, the customs revenues of the above- mentioned ports were specially excepted from those which formed the guarantee of the Russian loan. I am to state that Her Majesty’s Government must hold the Persian Government to the strict observance of this engagement.” In reply the Persian Foreign Minister assured Mr. Spring-Rice orally, with regard to Mohammerah, that it was clearly to the interest of the Persian Government to except as many ports as possible from the Russian guarantee, and that he was quite aware that Her Majesty’s Government would not agree to any interpretation of the Loan Contract which included Mohammerah among the ports on which Russia had a lien. At a later interview, on the 5th April, Mr. Spring-Rice was told by the Foreign Minister that the expression in the Russian Loan Contract was—“ except Ears and the Gulf of Fars,” and he was assured that “ not only in Mohammerah, “ but in every part of Persia where British interests “ are concerned, the Persian Government, before “ taking any steps of importance, would consult “ the British Government.” Mr. Spring-Rice was then instructed that he need not recur for the moment to the matter of the Mohammerah. customs unless any fresh incident should arise. 6 6. The money supplied to Persia through the Russian Government was very soon exhausted, and before the end of the year (1900) there were4 rumours of other loans. At the beginning of 190J. Mr. Spring-Rice wrote that the Imperial Bank of Persia might be asked for an advance of 200,000/. on their current account with the Persian Govern ment—an advance which “ would not be a loan “ within the meaning of the clause in the Russian “ Loan Agreement.” The Bushire customs, he remarked, were bringing in about 1,400Z. a week'', but he had suggested to the Bank to demand the Mohammerah customs as an additional guarantee, to solve the question raised at the time of the Russian contract. On the 14th March Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed from Teheran that the loan had been applied for from the Bank, repayable by 36 monthly instalments, the security being a preferential claim upon the southern customs. The arrangement was carried through in April, and an additional 20,000/. was lent a little later, making 220,000/. in all. The rate of interest was 12 per cent. The Imperial Bank, it may be explained, are not allowed by the terms of their concession to lend to the Persian Government beyond the limit of one-third of their paid-up capital of 650,000/., Le., 216,666/. (Appendix I.). Mr. Spring-Rice’s Despatch No. 20,. 6 th February 1901. (P. 73.) * 72,800Z. a year. Imperial Bank of Persia to Foreign Office, 20th September 1901. (P. 205.) 7. Still, the Persian Government continued in sore straits for money. They were willing to borrow from the British Government, and they were known also to be endeavouring to obtain a further loan from Russia. On the 28th October 1901 Lord Lansdowne telegraphed to the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg (Mr. C. Hardinge) to draw the attention of the Russian Government to the fact that any arrangement under which Persia would pass under the financial tutelage of either Power would be incompatible with the maintenance of the independence of the country, recognised by under standings arrived at in 1834 and 1888. A French paraphrase of this telegram was furnished to the Russian Foreign Minister, Count Lamsdorff, on the following day, its concluding words being as follows :—- U Angleterre a ton jours reconnu les interets preponder ants de la Russie dans le nord de la Perse. Dans le sud, au contraire, et surtout aux ports du Golfe Persan, _ autant qtien Seistan, la Grande- Bretagne a des interets quelle ne pent laisser ignorer. “ Ac Gouvernement de Sa Majeste est tout pret a discutcr avec le Gouvernement Imperial, de la fagon la plus amicale, la possibilite d'un arrangement par lequel des avances d'argent pourraient simultanement se faire a la ^ Perse par Ventremise des deux Puissances, qui accept era,lent respectwement comme gai antic les revenus Persans leves dans les spheres susmentionneesP Count Lamsdorff in reply informed Mr. C Hardinge that he had learnt from M. de Witte that, conB ary to what he had told Mr. Hardinge before, the Russian Bank had been in negotiation with the Persian Government for another loan, and that a small advance had in fact been already granted. He declared himself as most anxious to “Financial tutelage.” Telegram to Mr. C. Hardinge, No. 173, 28th October 1901. (P. 56.) Mr. C. Hardinge’s Despatch] No. 304, dated 30th October 1901. (P. 91.)

The position being as above explained, it was decided by Bis Majesty’s Government that the time had come for action. By two letters, dated the 6th and 11th November 1901 the Secretary of State for India expressed his willingness to advance to the Persian Government the sum of 500,000Z. It was explained in the later letter that the sum was to be advanced from Indian revenues in order to meet the convenience of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and that the principle, recorded in the Report of the Royal Commission on the Expenditure of India, of equal division between the British and Indian Governments of diplomatic charges in Persia, was recognised as applying to the case. The advance of the money w r as to be subject to certain conditions, which included, together with stipula tions as to the tariff, Seistan, &amp;c., security for the loan on the “ revenue of the customs of the ports of the southern littoral of Persia, including Moham- merah,” and a provision that the loan should not be repayable (unless by consent) within a period of ten years. 9. The offer of this advance was made to the Persian Grand Vizier, but the question was raised by him whether its acceptance would not conflict with the Russian Loan Contract of 1900. Sir A. Hardinge explained that he understood that agree ment to prohibit a foreign loan in the sense of the sale of Persian securities on the open market, but not such an arrangement as was proposed by His Majesty’s Government. The Persian Government still felt themselves, however, unable to accept the British offer, and the Grand Vizier informed Sir A. Hardinge on the 28th November 1901 that M. de Witte had refused to allow the Persian Government to accept a British advance, while practically agreeing himself to grant an advance of 1,000,000Z. On the 6th January 1902 Lord Lansdowne addressed to Sir A. Hardinge a comprehensive Despatch, of which a copy was subsequently furnished to the Shah,' :;: ' on the political and financial situation in Persia, and on the 8th February 1902 he instructed the British Ambassador at St. Peters burg, Sir C. Scott, to enquire of the Russian Government the grounds of their objection to the British advance to Persia. 10 10. At the request of Count Lamsdorff Sir C. Scott supplied him with a pro-memorid drawn up in accordance with Lord Lansdowne’s instructions, and the Russian reply w T as received on the 28th February 1902. The reply was tantamount to a refusal by the Russian Government to consent to the British advance, on the ground that the security assigned for the loan of 1900 had been represented by the Banque des Prets as insufficient. Further oral explanations, of no satisfactory character,6 were given to Sir C. Scott on the 5th March, and on the 10th March he forwarded to Count Lamsdorff, in a private letter, a memorandum making further inquiries in the matter. 11. Meanwhile the negotiations had been pro ceeding for a fresh Russian loan, and by the beginning of 1902 they had been greatly advanced by the withdrawal of Russian demands (1) for a concession for a pipe-line across Persia from the Baku oil-wells to Bushire, and (2) for the repay ment by the Persian Government of the sum already borrowed from the Imperial Bank of Persia {see paragraph b). Finally, on the 9th April 1902, an official announcement appeared in the Official Messenger at St. Petersburg of a new 5 per cent, loan of 10,000,000 roubles (roughly 1,000,0000) 1 ‘ sous garantie des memes recettes “ douanieres qui servent de garantie a Vemprunt “ de 1900 et aux memes conditions que pour cet “ emprnnt.” It was not until the 30th November 1902 that a copy of this Loan Contract was sent home bv Sir A. Hardinge. Its provisions were almost identical with those of the Contract of 1900, but by the insertion of an additional clause the Persian Government ^ was prohibited, not only from “issuing” (emettre), but also from “contracting” (contracter), without the consent of Russia, any foreign loan “d longue echeance.” The loan was redeemable in 75 years, and, since it could only be paid off “d partir du ler Janvier 1912,” with six months’ notice, the “ financial tutelage ” of the country was prolonged for two vears longer a contingency against which the “ Grand Vizier had been specially warned in a note from Sir A Hardinge dated the 28th March 1902. 12. Ihis second Russian loan concluded, Sir A Hardinge, on instructions from His Mai'esty’ Government, addressed to the Grand Vizier oi t] f l 0tl1 ^ a y j 902 a reminder as to the custom of Southern Persia ” from which the following f an extract :— I am, oi course, aware that the customs of ; large part of Southern Persia, viz,, Pars and tin ports on the 1 ersian Gulf, are explicitly excludec from the securities assigned for the second, as wel as for the first, Russian loan, and that there is happily no immediate prospect that this security wi 1 prove insufficient for the service of both loans wf S n m&lt; R tlme must be remembered that Fare ivli G G f w P ?v tS are ° nly a P° rtion of ‘ Southern 1 eisia ; that the amount of Persia’s total debt tc itussia lias just been increased by 1,000 000Z • and that the conditions of the first, Ind’ presudnably oi the second loan provide, m case of default for the control and supervision of the customs so pledged bj the Russian Bank, with no saving clause as regards those parts of ‘ Southern Persia ’ not ^ ^ ^ of Z Sir C.

At the beginning of 1903, after the con- clusion m the preceding year of the South African War, important correspondence'^ passed with the Foreign Office and the Government of India dis cussing, in relation to strategical considerations, the method by which His Majesty’s Government should come to the financial assistance of the Persian Government and the quid pvo quo to be asked for. Iheie was difficulty in making a direct loan in view of the engagements of Persia with Russia as to future borrowing, and in the final result it was agreed to advance to the Persian Government, through the agency of the Imperial Bank of Persia, a sum not exceeding 300,000b On the 8th April 1903 an agreement (Appendix III.) was signed at Tehran for an advance through the Bank of 200,000b, at the rate of 5 per cent, interest per annum. The Persian Government engaged to repay the advance, capital and interest, m 20 years out of the proceeds of the royalties of the Caspian fisheries (Ap pendix II.) ; if these were insufficient, out of the revenues of the posts| and telegraphs (para. 42), and, in the last resort, out of the revenues of the customs of Fars and of the Persian Gulf. Sir A. Hardinge at the same time reported that in the opinion of the Bank Manager the absence of any clause allowing anticipations was sufficient practical safeguard against repayment before the end of 20 years, and he added that later on the repayments might be transformed into a terminable annuity. The sum of 200,000b was paid to the Bank by the India Office on the 11th April 1903. 14 Remuneration of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Letter of Foreign Office to Bank, 7th April 1903. (P. 27). Pol. 2400/03. 14. The terms in which the Imperial Bank of Persia were to be remunerated for their share in the transaction are shown m the following extract of a lettei addressed to the Bank by the Foreign Office on the 7th April 1903 :— I am to inform you that, in the event of a satisfactory arrangement being arrived at, the sum of 200,000b will be paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia by the Secretary of State for India for the purpose of being advanced to the Persian Govern ment^ the Bank being the nominal lender, and charging the Persian Government interest at the late of 5 per cent, per annum, of which 4 per c,mt.8 will be remitted to the Secretary of State for India, the remaining 1 per cent, being retained by the Bank as a commission for its services in the matter. Any sums received in payment of the capital advance will be paid over at once to the Secretary of State for India without deduction.” 15. It was decided that the amount of the advance of 200,000h should be entered in the Monthly Statements, to be sent to India, of “Receipts “ and Disbursements of the Home Treasury of “ the Government of India,” under the heading “Advances Repayable,” and, later, that the same heading should be adopted in the case of various published statements of the Indian Accounts.

The Government of India were far from being satisfied with the arrangements made with the Persian Government in the matter of the advance, and in a telegram dated the 7th May 1903 they observed as follows “ Through the whole correspondence we have pressed for the southern customs as first security. It now appears that customs rank only as third security and are confined to customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf, a phrase that we thought extremely ambiguous.’’ Attitude of the Government of India in the matter of the advance. Viceroy’s Telegram, 7th May 1903. (P. 134.) 17. As a result Sir A. Hardinge gave explana tions in a long Despatch as to the exact financial situation in Persia, discussing the meaning of the ambiguous expression “ customs of Southern Persia,” as used in the Mushir-ed-Dovvleh’s note of the 23rd October 1897 (see paragraph 4), as well as of the expression “Pars and the Persian Gulf.” Did “Southern Persia” mean “Southern” as distinct from “Northern,” or “Southern” as distinct from “ Central ” as well as “Northern”? And was Mohammerah a “ Port of the Persian Gulf,” being 60 miles up the Shatt-el-Arab ? On these and other points much further correspondence passed, until on the 8th March 1904 a compre hensive memorandum was addressed to the Ain-ed- Dowleh embodying previous notes on the disputed points and calling attention to the fact that in a “ Reglement Douanier ” of the Persian Government no mention whatever was made of the customs of I ais and the Persian Gulf or the customs of “Southern Persia.” “The latter”—so ran the memorandum—“ are grouped into three districts “ called respectively ‘Arabistan,’ ‘The South,’ &lt;£ Baluchistan, and before authorising me to “ accept the Customs Regulations in the manner “ provided by the Convention of 1903, His Majesty’s ££ Government desire me to come to some clear understanding with the Persian Government as “ to the exclusion of all these three districts, which whether covered or not at the time by the term ‘bars and the Gulf of Pars”* are undoubtedly 1 ’ used in -i. etJ. o clltG UlK covered by the term ‘ Southern Persia Subsequent correspondence regard ing the expressions “Southern Customs ” Pars and the Persian Gulf,” &amp;c.

Their reply was, in its nature, a compromise, but it contained the important admission that, in excluding the customs of Pars and'the Gulf of Pars from the guarantee for the Russian loans of 1900 and 1902, “ the intention of “ the Persian Government was, without doubt, to “ preserve in freedom all its full rights of possession “ over all the ports of the south.” The reply was a compromise in that it referred to the impossi bility of interpreting the loan contracts “ without the participation of the Russian Bank,” and suggested that the question of Mohammerah might ultimately have to be referred to arbitration.

His Majesty’s Government did not consider the terms of the Persian reply to be satisfactory, and on their instructions Sir A. Hardinge presented a note to the Foreign Minister, dated the 30th August 1904, which contained the following words:— “ In order, however, to avoid any possibility of misunderstanding, I am instructed to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Govern ment hold them to their engagement of October 1897. This engagement is anterior to the Russian loan agreements, and cannot be affected by any of their provisions. “ I am, at the same time, to skate that, as it was admittedly intended by the British and Persian Governments that the term ‘ Fars and the Persian Gulf ’ should include all the customs of Southern Persia referred to in the engagement of 1897, His Majesty’s Government cannot admit a solitary exception in the case of Mohammerah and its dependencies, cr of any of the ports of Arabistan, and I am to add that His Majesty’s Government will take the necessary steps to insure respect for their rights in the event of any attempt on the part of the Persian Government to ignore them.” The omission of the last sentence was after wards asked for by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, but the the request was not followed up. In signing the Persian “ Reglement Douanier ” Sir A. Hardinge made a formal reservation, dated the 29th August 1904, to guard against the ex pression “ doudnes da Slid,' as therein used, being supposed to be synonymous with the same expression as employed in the Persian under taking of the 23rd October 1897 (see paragraph 4.) Second Anglo-Indian advance to 20. On the 1st September 1904 an agreement the Persian Government (£100,000). (Appendix IV.), was signed for the advance to the Persian Government—through the Imperial Bank, as on the last occasion—of a further sum of 100,000k The securities for the advance remained10 as they were before, but the amount of the loan was combined with the sum of 190,000L still remaining unpaid out of the previous 'advance,* and the total amount of 290,000L was to be repaid in 20 years by equal annual instalments of principal and interest combined, amounting to 23,270L 7s., the first instalment falling due on the 4th April 1905. It was also agreed that this scheme of repayment should only be capable of modification by consent of both parties. The amortization scheme for the loan is shown in the Table printed as Appendix Y. The figure for the annuity (23,2701. 7s.), was taken from Violene’s Tables, and was checked by the Bank in London. The sum of 100,OOOZ. was paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia by the India Office on the 7th September 1904. 21. The Imperial Bank of Persia had pre viously been addressed by the Foreign Office in a letter dated the 30th August 1904, in the following terms :— /‘I am to inform you that, in the event of a satisfactory arrangement being arrived at, the sum of 100,000b will be paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia by the Secretary of State for India, for the purpose of being advanced to the Persian Govern ment, the Bank being the nominal lender, charging the Persian Government interest at the rate of 5 per cent., of which 4 per cent, will be remitted to the Secretary of State lor India, and retaining a commission of 1 per cent., as in the case of Tast year’s loan.” 22 * 22. In the spring of 1905 fresh efforts were made by the Persian Government to obtain money.f The idea was conceived of asking the Imperial Bank of Persia, which had already lent rather more than the terms of its concession allowed (Appendix I) for a sum of 150,000b as a discount on, or redemption of, the annual royalty of 4,000£ which the Bank had to pay to the Shah. The plan fell through on account of legal difficulties, and a sum of 80,000b, obtained from the Russian Government, repayable in four years at 12 per cent was merely a temporary palliative. The assistance ol His Majesty s Government was invoked, and the Secretary of State in Council expressed his readi ness to provide from Indian revenues a further “ U +t! , of TT 150 ’ ( ] 0( ?

They are therefore prepared to facilitate an advance of a sum not exceeding 150,000Z., to be made in the same manner and on the same terms as regards security and interest as in the case of the two previous loans. His Majesty’s Government do not desire to attach any new conditions to this advance, and will be satisfied with the recapitula tion of assurances to which they consider that the Persian Government are already pledged. “These assurances are (1) that the Persian Government agree in the interpretation attached by His Majesty’s Government to the expression : customs of Pars and of the Persian Gulf,’ as notified in Sir A. Hardinge’s note to the Mushir-ed- Dowleh of the 30th August 1904; and (2) that railway construction in South Persia (including Seistan) shall, in so far as foreign assistance is required, only be carried out with the consent of His Majesty’s Government.” On the 4th October 1905 the Persian Minister told Lord Lansdowne that the Grand Vizier had written to him that he accepted these conditions, but he trusted that the amount of the loan would be made up to 300,0000 ; he added that formal instructions would be sent to him later on. An agreement, however, on these lines was not proceeded with, and later on the Grand Vizier increased his demands to 300,0000 Decision of British Government not to grant a loan.

Grey Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, telegraphic correspondence took place with the Government of India as to the propriety of granting a large loan to the Persian Government on political conditions, and Minutes on the subject were recorded by members of the Political Committee. In the result it was decided not to make a loan, the telegram sent to the Viceroy containing the following words :— “ It appears to His Majesty’s Government that in the present condition of Persia loan would be of no permanent benefit to her and would be granted solely for purpose of obtaining concessions of doubtful eventual value either in themselves or as means of resisting Russian influence in Southern Persia. It is true that application for loan will pretty certainly be made in another quarter. But we have strong reasons for feeling assured that, for an indefinite time at any rate, that application will be refused.” 24 Co-operation with the Russian Government.

On the 5th February 1906 Mr. Spring- Rice addressed a private letter to Count Lamsdorff, informing him of the rejection by the British Government of the Persian request for a loan, and12 explaining that His Majesty’s Government would expect reciprocity on the part of the Russian Government if a similar application should be made to them. dhe letter concluded with the following words :— “ Si, toutefois, 'pour quelque raison, le Gouverne- ment Imperial Ic croit desirable de preter un appui financier ii la Perse et qii il vent bien considerer la question de concert avec le Gouvernement Bntan- nique, je suis charge d'assurer votre Excellence que Sir Edward Grey est tout pret a entrer en discussion d ce sujet dans un esprit de conciliation^ On the 7th February Count Lamsdorff informed Mr. Spring-Rice orally that the Emperor had expressed his satisfaction at this communication. He added that he was himself quite of opinion that an end should be put to the practice under which the Persian Government was able to obtain money from the English or the Russian Govern ment by playing off one against the other. 25. Correspondence passed about the same time between the Foreign Office and the Imperial Bank of Persia' ::: ' regarding certain cheques of the Persian Government which the Bank had practi cally been obliged to honour, although by so doing it had raised the amount of the indebtedness to itself of the Persian Government to more than 100,000h beyond the limits of the Bank’s concession. (Appendix I.). The question was asked whether the Bank should accept drafts on the Southern Customs, payable in instalments, in lieu of immediate repay ment of the Persian overdraft. The Foreign Office declined the responsibility of advising the Bank, but gave a general assurance of diplomatic support at Tehran.

On the 14th April 1906 a sum of 5,500b was received by the India Office, of which 2,176b 10s. 9d. was treated as repayment of principal, and 3,323Z 9s. 3d. as interest. On the 22nd June 1906 a further sum was received of 15,106b 4s. lOcb Of this 7,032b 6s. 8d. was treated as principal, 7,925b 14s. 5d. as interest, and 148b 3s. 9d. as interest on the overdue instal ment, thus completing the payment due on the 4th April 1906. {See Appendix IX.) 27. Meanwhile a new development had taken place through the illness of the Shah, and the necessity of advancing money to the Yaliahd in conjunction with Russia, to secure a peaceable suc cession. To meet the situation the Secretary of State consented to advance from Indian revenues through the Imperial Bank a sum not exceeding 50,000b, on substantially the same conditions as governed the advances already made; the British Exchequer becoming responsible for the half of Payments by Persian Government on account of the 1903 04 advances.

Nicolson and M. Isvolsky, regarding the intention of the Persian Government to apply to Germany for financial assistance in default of aid from Great Britain or Russia. In the course of this conversation M. Isvolsky stated that he wished to act in harmony with the “tacit agreement” arrived at with Sir C. Spring-Rice (para. 24), and to consult with His Majesty’s Government as to the best means of affording relief to Persia. Communications followed between the Foreign Office and Tehran, and in the result an aide- memoire was sent to M. Isvolsky by Sir A. Nicolson on the 14th September 1906, proposing a joint Anglo-Russian advance of 400,000k, or 200,000k by each Power. The aide-memoire contained the following passage :—“ Le Gouvernement Britannique “ propose de prendre comme gar antics pour sa part “ de Vavance: (1) line hypotheque, outre celle quit “ possede dejd, sur les douanes des ports dans le “ midi de la Perse et dans le Golfe Persique; et (2) de recevoir du Gouvernement Persan un en- “ gagement quaucune concession pour chemins de “ fer, routes, ou telegraphes, ne soit accordee d “ Pautres Puissances d Vest d'une ligne tragee de “ Birjand a Bunder AbbasP* M. Isvolsky was averse to considering, in connection with the advance, the important question involved in the second of these conditions, but he informed Sir A. Nicolson on the 17th September 1906 that he saw no objection to the British Government taking as its security the customs in the south of Persia and in the Gulf. 29. After some further correspondence the text was approved of identic Loan Conventions to be executed by the British and Russian Banks with the Persian Government, stating that an advance of 400,000k would be made to the Persian Govern ment, of which 200,000k would be paid at once, in equal shares, by the two Governments. Interest was to be at the rate of 7 per cent., and the Russian and British Governments could demand repayment a year after signature of the contracts, on giving three months’ notice. The Russian advance was “ guaranteed by the revenues of the customs already “ affected to the guarantee of the two loans con- “ eluded in 1900 and 1902,” and the English advance “ by the revenues of the administrations “ of posts and telegraphs, and, in case of insuf- “ ficiency, the revenues of the customs of Fars and “ the Persian Gulf.” As regards the expression “ customs of Fars and the Persian Gulf,” the text of a note was approved by the Foreign Gffice to remind the S. 19. nPersian Government that “ His Majesty s Govern- “ ment hold to the interpretation already laid down “ in the note of the 30th August 1904 from this “ Legation ” (paragraph 19). The clause defining the British guarantee differed, it may be remarked, from that of previous loan contracts in its omission of the “ Caspian Fisheries” (Appendix II.). The omission was accepted by Sir C. Spring-Rice at the instance of his Russian colleague at Tehran, in view of the fact that no revenues were being derived from the fisheries. The course of the negotiations is described in Sir C. Spring-Rice’s Despatch No. 280, dated the 9th November 1906, but Sir A. Nicolson in a sub sequent Despatch, No. 773, of the 20th November 1906, corrected Sir C. Spring-Rice’s impression that M. Isvolsky had accepted merely in a personal capacity the guarantee asked for in His Majesty’s Ambassador’s aide-memoire of the 14th September 1906,of “ les douanes des ports dans le midi de la Perse et dans le Golfe Persique.” In telegraphing to Sir G. Spring-Rice Sir E. Grey expressed the opinion that M. Isvolsky’s statement on the subject was sufficient for the purposes of His Majesty’s Government. (P. 166.) Pol. 3849/06.

On this occasion the Treasury consented to advance from British revenues their moiety (50,000Z.) of the first instalment of 100,000L due from the British and Indian Governments. A sum of 50,000L was paid to the Imperial Bank by the India Office on the 4th October 1906.

On the 29th July following, the India Office drew the attention of the Foreign Office to the fact that there was no immediate likelihood of the sums set apart from Indian revenues for the Persian Government and the Vaiiahd being required for their respective purposes : Meanwhile the sum “ of 100,000k advanced from Indian Revenues is “ not available for the temporary loans in the “ London market which the Secretary of State in Council makes from the balances he holds in this “ country. The consequent loss is estimated at the “ rate of about 3,000k per annum.” It was suggested that the Bank should be asked to re transfer the amounts provided from Indian Revenues, and it was added that “ there will be no difficulty in providing at a very few days’ “ notice any sums it may be decided to advance to the Persian Government in pursuance of the “ agreement with the Russian Government.” Bice, No, 1 | As a cousequence the Treasury were repaid by the Imperial Bank of Persia the sum of 50,000k paid by them for an Anglo-Russian advance, and Pol. 3579/07. the sum of 100,000k referred to in the India Gffice Pol. 3022/08. letter was received by the Accountant-General at the India Office on the 7th September 1907.

Spring-Rice reported that the Persian Government would be unable to pay the annuity due the following month in respect of the Anglo-Indian advance of 290,000k With the concurrence of the India Office he was authorised to agree to a delay of six months in the payment of interest, on condition that a clause should be eliminated from the charter of the new National Bank granting it priority in the importation and sale of silver. Later, in reply to a formal request from the Persian Government, a note was addressed to them on the 31st August 1907 by Sir C. Spring- Rice, stating that His Majesty’s Government con sented to “a delay of three years, during which “ nothing should be paid on account of the sinking “ fund, but only interest, in order that the Persian “ Representatives might have time to carry on the “ necessary reforms and to put the income and “ expenditure of the country on a proper footing.” Three conditions were attached to this concession :— ign (1) that the Persian Government “ would not “ contract any new foreign loan without giving their “ creditors, England and Russia, the option of “ advancing money on the same conditions (2) that they “ should not grant to anyone the “ monopoly of coining silver in the State Mint, and “ that, in the matter of the importation of silver,16 “ all persons, whether Persians or foreigners, will “ be treated equally, and without distinction ; ^^ and (3) that, if reforms were not carried oup His “ Majesty’s Government should have the right to demand payment of the arrears of sinking fund “ at any time within the next three years. 34. The Anglo-Russian Convention was signed Ando-Russian Convention of 31st on the 31st August 1907. Article V. of the August 1907. “ Arrangement concerning Persia ” related to the question of Persian indebtedness, and its wording was as follows :— “ In the event of irregularities occurring in the amortization or the payment of the interest of the Persian loans concluded with the ‘ Banque ‘ d’Escompte et des Prets de Perse ’ and with the Imperial Bank of Persia up to the date of the signature of the present Arrangement, and in the event of the necessity arising for Russia to establish control over the sources of revenue guaranteeing the regular service of the loans concluded with the first-named bank, and situated in the region men tioned in Article II. of the present Arrangement, or for Great Britain to establish control over the sources of revenue guaranteeing the regular service of the loans concluded with the second-named bank, and situated in the region mentioned in Article I. of the present Arrangement, the British and Russian Governments undertake to enter beforehand into a friendly exchange of ideas with a view to determine, in agreement with each other, the measures of control in question, and to avoid all interference which would not be in confor mity with the principles governing the present Arrangement.” 35 35. Prior to the signing of the Anglo-Russian Convention, it was reported by Sir C. Spring-Rice, on the 8th July 1907, that payment in full had been made of the Russian coupon, and that the Director at Tehran of the Imperial Bank of Persia had stated that this had been in part effected by making payments from the revenue of the Southern Customs. Sir C. Spring-Rice explained later, that the receipts of the northern Customs had fallen short by 4,000L of the interest due the previous week on the Russian loan, and that the amount had been made good from the Bushire receipts. • On the British loan nothing had been paid, nor was likely to be paid, while the Bushire receipts, say, 85,0(J0L per annum, were being diverted to other objects. He added that the Imperial Bank of Persia were obtaining their own payments (or rather a portion of them) from the receipts of Kermanshah. On instructions from His Majesty’s Govern ment, Mr. Marling, who was now Charge d’Affaires addressed a note to the Persian Government on the 15th October 1907, in which he enquired “what I 4 satisfactory reasons the Persian Government can adduce for diverting to other purposes revenues Diversion of Bnshire Customs receipts from the service of the Anglo-Indian advance of £290,000.

About this time the Treasury raised the question whether Parliament should not be in formed of the liability of the British Exchequer in respect of the Anglo-Indian loan of the years 1903 and 1904: (290,000k), and the Foreign Office, in addressing the India Office, expressed the opinion that, “ in view of the conclusion of the Anglo- “ Russian Agreement, there is no longer any reason, from the point of view of foreign policy, “ for keeping secret the details of the loan.” The India Office replied that the Secretary of State was “ not aware of any circumstances that would “ render it inadvisable now to bring to the notice “ of Parliament the action which His Majesty’s “ Government have taken in this matter,” and the Foreign Office informed the Treasury, on the 21st February 1908, that Sir E. Grey saw no objection to bringing the matter to the notice of Parliament. They asked for “the views of the “ Lords Commissioners as to the manner in which “ the communication should be made,” and ex pressed the opinion that, “ in view of the absence “ of any papers which could conveniently be laid “ on the subject, any explanation given should “ take the form of a Statement, and that such “ Statement should set forth the reasons which “ have hitherto rendered inexpedient the publica- “ tion of the details of this transaction.” 37. In addressing the Foreign Office on the 11th February 1908 the India Office took occasion to invite them “ to agree to a simple procedure by which might be regulated ” the adjustment between the British and Indian Exchequers of any liabilities in respect of the Anglo-Indian loan of 1903 and 1904. A memorandum (Appendix VI.) suggesting the keeping of an “ Arrears Account ” by the Accountant-General at the India Office w r as enclosed in the letter, and a copy was forwarded to the Treasury by the Foreign Office in their letter of the 21st February 1908, with the remark that, under the terms of the memorandum no claim would be made against British funds “ in respect “ of temporary and comparatively trifling losses “ such as that occasioned by the dela\^ of six “ months in the payment of interest which was “ granted to the Persian Government in April “ last.” {See paragraphs 54 and 58.) 38. In the meantime, towards the middle of February, Mr. Marling had addressed a note to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh reminding him that “ neither “ has the interest on the British loan of 1903-04, “ due on the 4th April 1907, been paid, nor has any S. 19. e18 “ reply been given to the conditions formulated in “ Sir C.

On the 5th September 1908 the India Office enquired of the Foreign Office whether any decision had yet been arrived at upon the proposal made by the Foreign Office to the Treasury as to an expla natory statement to Parliament regarding the Anglo-Indian loan (paragraph 36). Copy of the letter was forwarded by the Foreign Office to the Treasury on the 12th idem. 41. A few months previously a telegram had appeared in the Berliner Tageblatt that the Shah had promised to pay an annual subsidy of 2,500L to the German School at Tehran, to be guaranteed by a lien on the Customs revenue. It was ascertained by Mr. Marling that payment of the subsidy was, in fact, to be made from the Customs funds, and correspondence passed with the Russian Govern ment as to a protest to the Persian Government. In the result, His Majesty’s Government decided to act alone, and a note was addressed on the 11th January 1909 to the Persian Government by Sir G. Barclay, who had now become Minister at Tehran, reminding them that the interest on the British loan of 1903 and 1904 was in arrear since the preceding April, and adding that “ if the resources “ of the Persian Government are pledged without “ the consent of His Majesty’s Government so as “ to imperil the security of the British loans and advances .... or to diminish the several “ revenues assigned to the service of their interest “ or sinking fund, His Majesty’s Government will “ be compelled to consider what steps are necessary “ for safe-guarding their interests.” 42. On the 2nd February 1909 the Foreign Office addressed the India Office on the question of the service of the Anglo-Indian loan:—“ Sir E. “ Grey is disposed to think that the collection of “ the Gulf customs by or on behalf of His Majesty’s “ Government, which a demand for repayment “ would probably entail, would be inopportune at “ the present moment, and might be regarded as “ interference in the affairs of Persia, which it “ would be advisable to avoid as long as possible. “ He would be glad to know whether it would “ be feasible to impound, by the agency of the “ Indo-European Telegraph Department, the pro- “ ceeds of the telegraph revenues, on which the “ advances are partially secured, should his Lord- “ ship agree that the collection of the customs “ should not be resorted to for the present.” In reply the Secretary of State for India ex pressed concurrence in the view that the collection of the customs would be inopportune, and stated that he was “ of opinion that it would be better not ,£ to press the demand for payment in a definite “ form till the question of the constitutional and “ financial regime to be established in Persia has “ further developed.” A note was transmitted of the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Tele graph Department, explaining that some 3,500Z.only could in an t y case be realised by impounding the telegraph revenues, and deprecating such action as likely to disturb existing relations between his own and the Persian Telegraph Departments. 43. Mention may here be made of a complaint by the Russian Government in the spring of 1908 that the Imperial Bank of Persia had sequestered the customs revenues of Kermanshah (in the Russian sphere) as a guarantee for sums due to the Bank from the Persian Government; it was pointed out that those revenues were part of the security for Russian loans. The Foreign Office ascertained that the action of the Bank had been based on a verbal arrange ment with the Persian Customs Administration, and, the Russian representations being held to be well- founded, a plan was proposed for transferring the lien acquired by the Bank from the customs receipts of Kermanshah to those of Bushire. A note with this object was addressed to the Persian Government on tire 4th November 1908, and, in the end, the Persian Government undertook to pay from the receipts of the Bushire customs, as interest on the Bank’s debts, the sum of 30,000 tomans a month (72,000Z. a year) with effect from the 21st March 1909 (the beginning of the Persian financial year). The Bank’s debts, it may be remarked, amounted in all at this time to 526,000Z. (leaving out of account the Anglo-Indian loan), or about 310,000L in excess of the amount authorised by their concession. Nearly half the debt was on account of their advance of 200,000L in 1901 (see paragraph 6), secured on the customs of Fars and the Persian Gulf. 44. Subsequently, on the falling off of the Bushire customs receipts, the receipts of the Mohamerah customs were also assigned, with the concurrence of the India Office, to the service of the Bank’s own loans. Sir G. Barclay had explained that the receipts at Ahwaz, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas should amply suffice for the service of the Anglo-Indian loan. 45. In giving their assent to the arrangement described in the preceding paragraph, the Treasury raised the question whether the Persian Govern ment should not be pressed for a further payment in respect of the Anglo-Indian loan. The Foreign Office considered that such action would be useless in the financial condition of Persia, but that “ the “ question must be considered when Persian finances “ are set in order, or if a further loan to the “ Persian Government is eventually guaranteed or &lt;£ made.” 46. The extent of the Persian Government’s indebtedness at this time had been disclosed in the iepoit of M. Bizot, their French Financial Adviser, dated the 15th March 1909, of which the main f Transfer of lien of the Imperial Bank of Persia on the Kermanshah Customs Receipts to those of Bushire. Sir A.

Barclay in the “You will notice that, in M. Bizot’s opinion, the need for a loan is indisputable, though he is my telegram No. 152 I gave it as 2,500,000Z. at the lowest estimate, independently of the small advances which would be needed for the reorganization of the Departments which most urgently call for reform, and I should mention that in this estimate I had M. Bizot’s concurrence. Besides the Govern ment’s debt to the two banks, amounting in round figures to some 1,200,000L, which, bearing exorbitant interest, cries loudly for conversion, there are other creditors’ claims which, according to a statement given to M. Bizot, already at the end of 1907-08 amounted to 2,751,638 tomans (550,000L). These must greatly have increased during the year just ended. There are also the claims for postal and road robberies, &amp;c., filed by the foreign Legations, of which it would be rash to attempt an considerable sum. “Assuming that the sum indicated above is approximately sufficient to convert the advances of the two banks, and to settle the claims of other creditors and those presented to the Persian Government by the foreign Legations, Persia’s total indebtedness may be estimated at something British and Indian Government’s loan, with arrears of interest - 300,000 “ To pay interest on this at 5 or 6 per cent, the customs receipts would amply suffice, leaving a very substantial sum at the disposal of the Persian Government, very nearly as large a sum, indeed, as that now left over after paying the interest on the loans and advances as at present secured on the proceeds of the customs. The conversion of the 1,200,0001. owed to the Imperial Bank of Persia and to the Russian Bank, so as to reduce the interest from 12 to 6 per cent., would effect a saving of 72,000Z. a year, or nearly enough to pay 6 per cent, on the sum needed to clear off the rest of the floating debt.” In April 1909 Sir G. Barclay sent home the folknv- unable to pronounce as to the amount required.

F* Converted, for this Memo., at the rate of 5 Tomans = 1/. t The calculation is as follows :— £ Charges to be borne by Customs 620,000 Saving by Conversion of Debt - 100,000 Total - £520,000 or 20 , 000 Z. less than net customs receipts, as above, viz., 540,000/-. 80,000L of the highest level reached by the customs net revenue, viz., 602,208Z. in 1907-08*. There were however certain later charges, e.g., the ex-Shah’s pension, which, in Sir G. Barclay’s opinion, would also have to be borne by the customs, bringing up the total of such charges to 620,000L, or 80,000Z. more than the previous year’s net receipts, viz. 540,000L Sir G. Barclay commented on the position in the following terms :— “ It is quite evident that on the basis of M. Mornard’s statement no further borrowing is possible on the security of the customs, and although only the first four items are fixed charges by virtue of engagements undertaken by the Persian Government, the remaining eleven items being merely chargeable to the customs in accor dance with usage, it would be difficult to relieve the customs of any of these latter. The Russian Government would doubtless object to an} T other security for the payment of the Cossack brigade, and it is important that the salaries of the European Government officers should be well secured. ■ The rest of the eleven items mostly appertain to the customs administration. It is thus evident that a condition precedent for any further borrowing must be the conversion of the advances, &amp;c., of the two banks, and even this would, as I calculate it, only leave sufficient margin for a very trifling loan unless it were found possible to relieve the customs revenue of some of those heads of expenditure with which it has hitherto been charged in accordance with usage. The advances of the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Russian Bank carry for the most part interest at the rate of 12 per cent, and over. The debt to the two banks amounts, as I understand it to be tween 8,500,000 tomans (1,700,0002.)- and 9,000 000 tomans (1,800,0002.), of which I would hazard an estimate that 7,000,000 tomans (1,400,0002.) carry interest at the rate of 12 or 15 per cent. The con version of this debt and the reduction of the interest to 5 per cent, would effect a saving of probablv 500,000 tomans (100,0002.), in which case, supposing that the customs receipts do not fall below last year’s level—and for the first six months of this year they show an increase—there would be a margint for borrowing of 100,000 tomans (20,0002.).” 50 * Negotiations as to financial assist ance for the Persian Government. Attitude of the India Office. Persia Print, 26th February 1910, sec. 4. Pol. 3268/10. 50. Meanwhile the question of giving financial assistance to the Persian Government was con tinuously under discussion between the British and Russian Governments. Should both Governments, or one of them, supply the assistance needed, or should both the British and the Russian Banks, or one of them, come to the rescue ? The various stages of the negotiations are set out m a Eoreign Office Memo., dated the 26th February 1910, and it is unnecessary here to do more than mention the salient facts. So far as India is concerned the position in May 1909 is shown in the foliovvingextract from a telegram addressed to the Viceroy on the 11th May 1909 :— “ His Majesty’s Government are pledged, subject to fulfilment by Shah of conditions imposed, and to safeguards on proper expenditure of funds, to contribute moiety of joint advance by two Govern ments to enable Shah to meet urgent claims, discharge of which is necessary to secure ^ his position on establishment of new regime. dotal amount of joint advance is not to exceed 400,000L in all in accordance with agreement with Russian Government described in my telegram of ord October 190o, which has been treated as holding good in principle throughout subsequent phases of negotiations with Russia. Conditions which made that agreement necessary apply with equal force now, and I recognise that India must in the cir cumstances accept financial responsibility for 100.000L, being a moiety of British share of joint advance. “But as regards any further financial assistance to Persia, India is free from any engagement, and I have made it clear to Foreign Office that, apart from objections on grounds of general Imperial policy to financial and other entanglements in Persia, I cannot admit that Indian interests in Persia are of a nature to justify expenditure from Indian revenues on schemes for establishing reformed government in Persia. Such schemes involve not only financial risk but danger of inter national complications, from responsibility for which it is essential that India should be kept entirely free.” On the 16th July 1909 a new era was entered on in Persian politics by the flight of the Shah to the Russian Legation, and his immediate deposition.

Barclay telegraphed that the programme of the Persian Cabinet, including a proposal to apply for an advance of 500,0001, had been submitted to the Medjliss, and he urged that the British and Russian Governments should not be deterred from nego tiating a joint loan by the impossibility of further . borrowing on the customs as disclosed in M. Mornard’s statement regarding the “ fixed charges ” (paragraph 49). The Foreign Office concurred in his view as to the desirability of an advance, and, in their letter to the India Office of 7th December 1909 observed that “Sir E. Grey “ attaches great importance to the conversion of the “ debt owed by the Persian Government to the “ Imperial Bank of Persia, and to the Russian “ Discount Bank, which he considers should be a “ necessary condition of any loan.” 52 Proposal of the Persian Government to apply for an advance.

It is true, again, that India is part of the Empire, and should take “ its share in the burdens of Empire. The moment, “ however, is not a happy one for resort to this line “ of argument, as Indians are now sharply resenting “ a denial to them of equality of citizenship within “the Empire by colonial communities not them selves contributing to its defence. It may be true, indeed, that order in Persia might help Indian commerce. Put Lord Morley is not con vinced that improvement in the sphere of Indian trade by means of this kind is assured enough to “ justify the imposition of new burdens upon the “ general body of Indians. Nor is he convinced “ that even the conversion of the Persian debt “ would strike either the judgment or the imagi- “ nation of the Indian taxpayer as a specifically “ Indian interest. “ While, therefore, he is reluctantly obliged to “ assume responsibility for the loan of 100,COOL to which he agreed in May last, Lord Morley is not “ prepared to recommend his Council to sanction “ any further advance.” Anglo-R/ussian Note offering advance (£400,000).

On the 18th February 1910 a joint Anglo- Russian Note, dated the 16th idem, was handed to the Persian Government, stating the conditions on which the two Powers were prepared to make a joint advance of 400,000k They related, briefly, to (1) control of the expenditure of the money, (T) appointment of seven French officials in the Ministry of Finance, (3) formation of gendarmerie or road guards, (4) railways, (5) navigation of Lake Urumiah, and the last condition (6) was worded as follows:— “ Cette avance constituera le 'premier versement de Vemprunt sollicite dejd par le gouvernement Persan, si les gouvernements de Grande-Bretagne et de Russie consentiraient a cet emprunt. Dans le cas contraire, cette avance, a,u taux de 7 pour cent., sera amortie en dix versements egavx, garantis par les revenus des douanes et, en cas d’insuffisance de ces derniers, les revenus de la monnaie serviront de garantie supplementaired ’ The profits of the Mint, it may be observed, had been stated by Sir G. Barclay to amount to 5,000/. a month. In their letter of the 19th February 1910 the Foreign Office requested that the sum of 100,000/. should be paid once more to the Imperia] Bank ofPersia from Indian revenues, adding that the Treasury had been requested to take similar steps with regard to the British moiety of the advance. The India Office consented, and the sum of 100,000b was paid to the Bank by the Accountant-General on the 25th February 1909. 54. In paragraph 37 mention has been made of a letter addressed by the India Office to the Foreign Office on the 11th February 1908, suggesting a form of procedure for regulating the adjustment between the British and Indian Exchequers in respect of the Anglo-Indian loan of 1903 and 1904 (290,000b). On the 16th June 1909 a reminder was sent by the India Office on the subject, and subsequently demi-official correspondence 0 passed between the Financial Secretary, India Office, and the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury, in the course of vdiich it was calculated that on the 4th April 1909 the liability of the Treasury to Indian revenues v T as 147,163b 45. 9cb In assenting to the payment to the Imperial Bank of Persia of the sum of 100,000b, referred to in the last paragraph, the India Office drew the attention of the Foreign Office to the fact that their official letters of the 11th February 1908 and the 16th June 1909 had remained unanswered, and requested an early reply “ with a view of termi- “ Bating the present anomalous position in which “ the Indian Government are pressed to make a further advance, whde the Lords Commissioners “ of the Treasury make no effort to discharge their liabilities.” A copy of this letter was forwarded by the Foreign Office to the Treasury on the 4th March 1910. On the 9th April 1910 the India Office addressed to the Foreign Office another stronglv worded reminder on the subject. 55. By April it had become apparent that there w'as little likelihood of the Persian Government accepting the Anglo-Russian advance conditionally offered (paragraph 53). Accordinglv the India Office suggested to the Foreign Office, in a letter dated the 15th April 1910, that the Indian payment of 100,000b should be refunded by the Imperial Bank of Persia, adding that “there would be no “ difficulty in providing the sum again at very few “ days’ notice.” The money was repaid on the 19th April. 56 Letter of India Office to Foreign Office, 24th February 1910.

The India Office, while assenting to these proposals, suggested that it should be made clear that the prior lien on the southern customs of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and of His Majesty’s Government, would in noway be affected, and drew attention to the importance of separate accounts being kept in respect of the proposed new advance. A proposal was agreed to that, subject to the prior lien referred to, the “ quasi-fixed charges ” (as they now had been called) on the whole of the customs of Persia should be made permanent. It was added that the Indian share of the advance would be forthcoming when it was known that the Treasury were making a similar payment. 5/. In the first half of 1910 an arrangement was carried through, to the importance of which allusion has more than once been made (para graphs 4G, 49, and 51), viz., the amalgamation of the debts of the Imperial Bank of Persia. The corre spondence between the Foreign and India Offices* was based on telegrams sent home by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran and the local manager of the Imperial Bank, and the text of the agree ment arrived at, together with that of three supplementary letters addressed by the Bank to the Minister of Finance (Appendix VIII.), was received in a despatch from Mr. Marling, dated the 8th June 1910. The general character of the arrangements is, briefly, as follows :— Exclusive payment is to be made to the Bank, in the first instance, of the full net customs receipts of the Persian Gulf ports, including Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Mohamerah, and Ahwaz, and from these receipts monthly payments will be made for the service of the Bank’s own debt, and also that of the Anglo-Indian debt, the interest on the former being 7 per cent, in currency, on the latter 5 per cent, in sterling, as before. No pay ments on account of the redemption of capital will be made for three years in respect of the Anglo- Indian debt (314,281b 16s. 4d. on the 21st March 1910), but thereafter yearly payments will be made, in respect of both interest and capital, of 30,278b 12s. 7&lt;b, extinguishing the debt in 15 years, the final payment being due on the 20th March 1928. It was decided by His Majesty’s Government, m the course of the negotiations, not to surrender their lien on the Caspian fisheries (Appendix II.) and on the Posts (paragraph 13) and Telegraphs (paragraph 42).28 It was also brought forward that the text of the agreement would sufficiently provide against the Persian Government being able to pay off the Government loan except by instalments. Mr. Marling’s Telegram, No. 195, 28th April 1910. Pol. 3283-85/10. 58. In view of the agreement described in the preceding paragraph, it was arranged with the Foreign Office that it was unnecessary at present for any payment to be made from the British Exchequer to Indian revenues in respect of loss through the non-payment of interest on the Anglo- Indian advance of the years 1903 and 1904. The Treasury undertook, if further default should take place, to ask Parliament to make good the British share of that loss, and, pending such default, they considered that it would be well to defer making any announcement to Parliament on the subject. The India Office agreed that there was no reason for such announcement, “ unless attention is called to the matter. The Auditor, it may be remarked, had made in his Report on the India Home Accounts, dated the 2nd May 1910, the following observations : — “ Interest realised from investment of Cash Balance, &amp;c., 47,236L 18s. Id. “ The sum of 10,494Z.

Up to the time of writing (17th October 1910), there does not appear to be any immediate prospect of the proposed Anglo-Russian advance of 400,0000 being made to the Persian Government. In a Despatch dated the 15th June 1910 it has been explained by Mr. Marling that the Customs revenues could not be regarded as providing adequate security for an advance of that amount.

See pao- e 58 of Foreign Office VoL This Bank was founded in 1889 in virtue of a Persian concession and a British Charter. .Its capital paid up was 1,000,000L, subsequently reduced by the writing-off of losses, principally in exchange and silver, to 650,0000 By the terms of the Charter there is a liability in case of insolvency equal to the paid-up capital. The capital may be increased to 3,000,000k Bank notes may be issued in Persia to the extent of the paid-up capital guaranteed by a metallic reserve of 33 per cent. The present amount of the note issue varies from 250,000k to 300 000£ four-fifths of which is in Tehran alone. Advances to the Government may not exceed, according to the Charter, one-third of the paid-up capital. The majority of the Board is to be of British nationality. Operations of the Bank. The Bank:— (a) issues notes; (h) takes deposits and discounts bills ; (c) buys and sells foreign exchange and imports silver for coinage ; (d) makes advances to the Government ; (e) makes advances to private individuals. .

(Referred to in paragraphs 13, 29, 55, and 57.) Note on the Caspian Fisheries. In his Despatch, No. 23, dated the 22nd February 1903 (P. 352) it was reported by Sir A. Hardinge that the Persian Government had decided to raise money by selling for a lump sum the royalties, or rental on the lease, of the Caspian Fisheries. The fisheries had been leased for many years to a Russian merchant of Astrakhan, named Leonozoff, and the latest of the contracts executed was for an extension for five years, from 1920 to 1925 at an increased rental of 20,000k a year. M. Naus estimated that the sale of the royalties for the 22 years should bring in 350,000k In a later Despatch, however, No. 149, dated the ICth August 1904 (P. 33), Sir A. Hardinge wrote as follows “ The Caspian Fisheries, which “ have hitherto yielded 20,000k a year, have ceased to be a real guarantee, “ nor would any banker now lend money on their security, since, under the “ new commercial regime as between Persia and Russia, the Russian “ Government can impose, and has intimated its intention of imposing, upon “ Persian fish the duties authorised by the Russian general tariff instead of “ the old 5 per cent, ad valorem duty. . . . For this year, moreover “ and for the two following years, the fisheries have already been discounted “ to their concessionaire by the Atabeg-i-Azam.” In a Despatch, No. 299, dated the 22nd November 1908 (P. 207), Sir G. Barclay reported that the Persian Government had pledged the Caspian Fisheries Royalties to an Armenian Banking Firm for a further period of three years—1912, 1913, and 1914. Throughout the correspondence it has been recognised that these fisheries afforded merely a nominal security for the Anglo-Indian loan to34 APPENDIX VI. (Referred to in 'paragraph 37.) Memorandum enclosed in India Office Letter to Foreign Office of 11th February 1908. (See page 106 of Foreign Office Volume). The debt due from the Persian Government having been practically converted into an annuity for 20 years, payable on the 4th April in each year from 1905 to 1924 inclusive (viz.: 21,133L 7s. 3d. in 1905 and 23,270b 7s. in subsequent years), the Accountant-General at the India Office will prepare and keep up an “Arrears Account ” showing the amount due from the Persian Government in consequence of any failure on its part to pay the instalments of the annuity in full at the right dates. He will debit to this account the amount by which the payment, if any, made by the Persian Government on the 4th April of each year falls short of 23,270b 7s., will add once a year interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum on the amount at debit, and will credit to the account any sums received in respect of arrears. He will append to the account a statement showing what portion of the arrears represents money that should have been paid to Indian revenues (with interest thereon) and what portion represents money that should be paid to the Imperial Bank (the amount so payable being one-fifth of all payments that should have been made in respect of the interest portion of the annuity, together with interest at five per cent, thereon added yearly). Once m thiee yeais he will send to the koreign Office the account and appended statement, and the Foreign Office will pay to the India Office one- half of the amount by which the debt due to Indian revenues has been increased during the preceding three years. If the debt has been reduced, he will pay to the Foreign Office one-half of the amount of the reduction. India Office, 24th December 1907. APPENDIX VII. (Referred to in paragraph 49.)

APPENDIX VIII. (Referred to in paragraph 55.) Agreement between the Persian Government and the Imperial Bank of Persia. (Enclosed in Mr. Marling’s Despatch No. 92, 8th June 1910 — Pol. 3556/1910.) In conformity with the negotiations which have taken place between the Persian Government and the Imperial Bank of Persia, it is hereby agreed that:— I- The consolidation of the several amounts due to the Imperial Bank of Persia, according to the statement rendered to and accepted by the Persian Government, is hereby effected, and the interest payable thereon from the 21st March 1910, is fixed at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum. 2. Payment of interest on the loan and redemption of the capital will be effected by the Persian Government paying the yearly instalments amounting to 3,729,390'95 krans, as set forth in Clause No. 3, in proportional monthly amounts of 310,782'60 krans covering a period of fifteen years from the 21st March 1910. 3. As security for the debt and as guarantee for the payment of the yearly instalment of 3,729,390'95 krans agreed upon, the full net customs receipts of the Persian Gulf ports, including Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Mohammerah, and Ahwaz, are hereby made payable to the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Persian Government bind themselves by the terms of this agreement to pay exclusively to the Imperial Bank of Persia all such customs receipts with no deduction save that of the actual expenses of administration of the customs of the above-named ports for a period of 15 years or until such time as the debts shall be totally extinguished. 4. The Imperial Customs will pay to the Imperial Bank of Persia, week by week, the above-mentioned Customs receipts of the whole of the Persian Gulf ports, including Mohammerah and Ahwaz, and the Imperial Bank of Persia will render to the Persian Government monthly, on the 21st of eachdD month, accounts of all such receipts, and the surplus remaining—after due provision has been made from such funds to meet the amount required for amortisation of capital and payment of interest month by month—shall be at the disposal of the Persian Government. 5. In the event of the receipts of the above-mentioned ports for any one month falling below the amount required for the service of the debt, the Persian Government binds itself to make good any such deficiency from other sources of Government revenue, so as to fully meet the obligation to the bank undertaken by the Southern Customs for the month in question. 6. The Persian Government binds itself to discontinue all drafts on the Southern Customs other than for actual administrative expenses immediately connected with the collection of their receipts until the monthly amount due to the bank shall have been paid. 7. The Persian Government has the option of repaying the whole of the debt at the end of any one year, viz., the 20th March, and it is agreed that notice will be given in writing two months before the end of any such year in which it is the intention of the Persian Government to take advantage of this option. 8. The Imperial Bank of Persia will allow the Persian Government interest at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum on all funds paid in for the redemption of the loan from the day on which they are paid in to the date on which they are applied for that purpose. 9. And it is further agreed that, as regards the sterling loan of 290,000b of 1903-04, the payment of the interest and redemption of capital—amounting on the 21st March 1910, with arrears, to 314,281b 16s. 4d.—shall be paid oS m fifteen equal annual instalments of 30,278b 12s. Id., and in case the other revenues affected to the service of the loan by the convention of the 1st September 1904, should prove insufficient, the Imperial Bank of Persia agrees, and is hereby authorised, to apply any surplus remaining over from the receipts of the above-mentioned Persian Gulf ports after payment of the said monthly instalments (of 310,782-60 krans) to the payment of the annual instalment of 30,278b 12s. Id., the payment being made in equal monthly instalments as provided in Article 4 of the present agreement It is clearly understood that m all other respects the provisions of the Loan Convention of 1904 remain m full force.

British consul at Shiraz states that there is considerable difficulty in financing the Fars gendarmerie on hard and fast principal of 8,000Z. a month, though force of close upon 2,000 men can be maintained on 100,0O0Z. advanced by His Majesty’s Govern ment for one year, provided more latitude can be exercised in the matter of spending the money. Larger purchases have to be made at some seasons of the year than at others : as, for instance, at the moment it is most essential that forage and firing for whole year should be bought, because prices will rise very considerably in a month or two. Expenditure of money is entirely in hands of British consul, Swedish officer commanding, and Belgian financial agent, reference being made to colonel commandant, M. Mornard, and myself, so that there is no danger of money being diverted to other purposes. For above reasons I would beg to recommend for your favourable consideration that money should be made available for year without tying it down to 8,000Z. a month. British consul would hold himself responsible for proper expenditure of money in such a manner that it will suffice for year. \ Gufo urtii CONFIDENTIAL Z O S13 J Sir W.

No. 1. PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. 'f ” [25138] Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received Jane 2.) g^. 0 ^ Tehran, May^ 13, 1913. I HAVE the honour to transmit copies of the note and signed aide-memoire which I addressed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 16th Aprd, offering the Imperial Government an advance of 100,0001. for the financial requirements of the Ears gendarmerie, and placing on record the views of His Majesty’s Government respecting their prescriptive right to control the buoyage and lighting of the I ersian Gulf, and their claim to the right to afford protection in Persia to natives of Bahrein and the , subjects of the Trucial chiefs. My action in this matter has been based upon the / gq j instructions contained in your telegram No. 182 of the 11th A.pnl and previous telegraphic instructions. I have also the honour to enclose translations of the replies received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and copies of the letters that I subse quently addressed to the Treasurer-General and the manager of the Bank of Persia, advising them of the arrangement made, together with copies of their answers. In'view of the unproductive negotiations that I had already carried on respecting the arrangements it was desired to make with the Persian Government for the settlement of the questions in the Persian Gulf, it was hardly to be expected tha 1 should receive a more satisfactory reply to the aide-memoire than that made by Yossugh-ed-Dowleh. In communicating it, his Excellency sent hi&amp; “chei de cabinet to express an earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government would not think that the Persian Government were inspired by contentious feelings or that they did not ±eeI most deeply grateful to His Majesty’s Government not only for the advance of the 100 000Z. which,, it was hoped, would assist materially m the restoration of^ order m the south, but more especially for their generally benevolent attitude to Persia m e face of recent most vexatious incidents, which had caused^the Imperial Government the greatest distress and concern. The Cabinet, Moin-el-Vezireh added was afraid m the absence of the Medjliss, to risk the assumption ot greater responsibilities than those it had already burdened itself with. , • . The advance to the gendarmerie has raised a question concerning the financial requirements of that administration which will require careful examination. As you sir' are aware, Ala es-Sultaneh gave me to understand last January that he had ascertained, after consultation with Colonel Hjalmarson, that a sum of 35°,0001 woe d be required to finance the Pars scheme for three years Having ascertained that this figure was considered to be more than sufficient for the purpose, I suggested that an advance of 100,000h would serve to meet the requirements of the first yeai. Barely a month later, Colonel Hjalmarson produced a new scheme designed to cover an increase of the gendarmerie for the whole of Persia, raising the numbers of the foice to 8,000 men and entailing an annual expenditure of 400,0001. Under ^ -w scheme, the force to be employed in Pars was raised to 3,300 men, at a cost of 344,000/. for two year The new scheme received somewhat cursory attention because it was not supposed that it would be put into execution without the approval of the Persian Govemme , which I thought would certainly hesitate before agreeing to a proposal tfo.t made such-a heavy demand upon the slender financial resources of the countiy. It is more than JowL that tlJ project was never examined closely, and m any case no answer was returned. The Swedes taking silence as equivalent to remuf to wait the usual six months for a Persian answer, have at once set to work to ^c.uit on the increased scale, and have presented financial re du ls [y° n p l “ ^ p new budget, which would appear never to have been submitted at all to the treas Gene The Government are quite prepared to put a large sum aside for the gendarmerie out of the Iffint advances, which may serve to supply the necessary funds for six or eight months, but it is hard to see from what quarter the 'The enlarged force will come when the money laid aside from the ad\ances is knished. _ IreXer Gene^l is of opinion that there cannot be too many gendarmes^ and is [2948 6—9]2 optimistic about finding funds for their maintenance. I entirely agree with M. Mornard that the gendarmerie force should he as large as circumstances will allow, but it appears to me that some caution must be exercised or we shall run the risk of finding a force that promises to render invaluable assistance, suddenly brought to naught for want of money. Regular pay has proved so far the secret of their success.

AS your Excellency is aware his Highness Ala-es-Sultaneh called upon me on the 11th January last for the purpose of requesting me to urge His Majesty’s Government to make an advance of 350,000£. to the Imperial Government for the purpose of establishing and maintaining for three years a gendarmerie force in the province of Ears capable of establishing order upon the important trade-route that runs through that province. His Highness suggested that the advance should be repayable from the large loan that the Persian Government hoped to negotiate at an early date. His Highness intimated that this money would be set aside by the Treasurer-General of Persia at the complete disposal of Colonel Hjalmarson, the chief instructor of the gendarmerie, and would be entirely allocated to the requirements of public security in Jars, and expressed a hope that His Majesty’s Government would make an immediate advance of half the sum required. I have now the honour to inform your Excellency that I am authorised by Sir E. Grey to place 100,000/. at the disposal of the Imperial Government. The money to be placed to a separate account at the Imperial Bank of Persia entitled “ Tresorier general: Gendarmerie de Ears and to be available in monthly instalments of 8,000/. to be remitted by the Treasurer-General to the competent gendarmerie officers by arrano-ement with Colonel Hjalmarson. It is understood that this advance will be repayable out of the large loan when negotiated ; that it will be secured upon the surplus of the Southern Customs; that it wi bear interest at 7 per cent, per annum; and that, in the event of no loan being made, it will be repayable from the surplus revenues of the above-named Customs in due couise, and aftei die previous advances made by His Majesty’s Government amounting in all to 340,000/. have been liquidated.

His Highness added that the above-mentioned sum of money would be set aside by the Treasurer-General of Persia at the complete disposal of Colonel Hjalmarson, and entirely allocated to the requirements of public security in Pars on the basis of a budget that had aheady been, prepared by Colonel Hjalmarson. Ihe request preferred by Ala-es-Sultaneh was duly communicated to His Majesty’s Government, who have expressed their willingness to advance 100,000Z. upon conditions explained m an official note from His Majesty’s Legation of even date. In authorising His Majesty s Minister to place the above-mentioned sum of money at the disposal of the irersian Government to a separate account at the Imperial Bank of Persia under the ea mg Tresorier general: Gendarmerie de Bars,” Sir Edward Grey has agreed that the entire sum should be paid in in one payment, but he has stipulated that it shall be disbursed in tv\ elve monthly instalments of 8,000Z. each, leaving a sum of 4,OOOZ. that can be drawn upon m case of emergency. Further, that money shall be spent under the control oi the -Treasurer-General, who will only authorise payments from the same after consultation with the chief instructor of the gendarmerie. These moneys will be transmitted on the order of the Treasurer-General to the Shiraz branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia to the account of the financial agent, who will in turn remit them to the Swedish officer commanding the gendarmerie of Ears. The monthly budget of the gendarmeiie of Ears will he prepared by the chief instructor at Tehran in accord with the Treasui er-General, after having ascertained the views of the officer in command at Shiraz, who will take counsel with the financial agent at that place. It is further understood that all purchases for the gendarmerie in the south will be put up to open His Majesty s Government had hoped that, in view of the benevolent attitude adopted towards Persia in the matter of the disorders on the southern trade routes, which have led to^ assaults upon British officials and seriously affected British trade and of the readiness displayed to assist Persia financially, the Imperial Government would have been disposed to come to a definite understanding with the British Government, concerning certain questions connected with the Persian Gulf, such as the buoyage and lighting, and the recognition of the right of British consular officers to protect certain persons. Seeing, however, that the Persian Government are reluctant to undertake the / responsibility of making a satisfactory written arrangement upon the subject, His Majesty’s Government have decided to withdraw the demands which were put forward as a condition of the advance of 100,0000Z. on behalf of the gendarmerie of Ears ; but in doing so they wish it to be understood that they regard themselves as possessing a prescriptive right to control the lighting and buoyage arrangements in the Gulf, which, if occasion arose, they would not hesitate to enforce. His Majesty’s Government also wish it to be made clear that they maintain their attitude respecting the right of British consular officers to extend protection in Persia j to the subjects of Bahrein and the trucial chiefs, and that, in refraining from pressing their request for Persian recognition of this claim, they do so only on the understanding that their rights will not be disputed in practice.

As regards the amount of these instalments it is not clear whether the sum of 50 000L mentioned is to be paid in respect of each half of the total advance of 400 0001 or whether it represents the total instalment to be divided between Russia on thc’nne hand and India and His Majesty’s Government on the other ; but even on the laLT’assmnption it seems improbable, ii view of Sir W.

Townley {Tehran). (No. 107.) R. Foreign Office, March 6, 1913. MY telegram No. 75 of llth February aud your telegram No. 79 of 22nd February. You may inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government agree to their proposal that the advance of 200,0001., the British share of the joint advance, should bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent., and be secured on the surplus of the southern customs, be repaid out of the next large loan, and if no loan is concluded by 1st January, 1915, by half-yearly instalments of 50,000L I presume that 50,0001. will be paid in respect of each half of the total advance of 400,0001. The advance of the 100,000L for the gendarmerie must be treated in the same way. You state that the total surplus of the southern customs available is 6,000Z. a month. The interest on the advance already made absorbs 8177. a month. The interest on 300,0007. more will absorb 1,7507., which makes a total of 2,5707. a month, leaving at the outside 3,4307. a month. Properly speaking, His Majesty’s Government should in the interests of the British taxpayer impound the whole of this surplus to provide for repayment of the advances, but I recognise that insistence on this course would unduly embarrass the Persian Government. I should be disposed to forgo for the present repayment of the first advance (namely, of the 140,0007.) if the Persian Government could give some further security for the repayment of both advances (the 140,0007. and the fresh 300,0007.). It seems improbable that the southern customs would bear from 1st January, 1915, the payment of 50,0007. half-yearly, in addition to repaying the 140,0007., or are the Persian Government counting on a great expansion of the revenue ?

Treasury to Foreign Office .— (Received March 4.) (Confidential). gi r&gt; Treasury, March 3, 1913. I HAVE laid before the Lords Cominisioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, Sir L. Mallet’s letter of the 25th ultimo, further respecting the proposed advances to the Persian Government, and am directed to make the following reply :— Their Lordships, for their part, see no objection to the proposals of the Persian Government that the Anglo-Russian advance should bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent., be secured on the customs receipts of the North and South respectively, and be repayable out of the contemplated loan ; and that if that loan has not been made by the 1st January, 1915, repayment of the advances should then begin by half-yearly instalments. As regards the amount of these instalments it is not clear whether the sum of 50,000/.. mentioned is to be paid in respect of each half of the total advance of 400,000/. or whether it represents the total instalment to be divided between Russia on the one hand, and India and His Majesty’s Government on the other; but even on the latter assumption it seems improbable, in view of Sir W. Townley’s telegram, No. 80 of the 22nd idtimo, that the southern customs revenue will be able to provide for such a charge from the 1st January, 1915, in addition to providing for the repayment of the 140,000/. already advanced and the security of other revenues should therefore be obtained. . The further question, whether the whole of the surplus (southern) customs j.0Y0j2-Q0g should be absorbed for the service of these advances, is one which m then Lordships judgment must depend largely on political and administrative considerations. As trustees for the British taxpayer my Lords must press the Secretary of State to obtain the fullest security for these substantial advances, and this would point to the impounding of all the surplus receipts. . , They recognise however that to insist upon this course may paralyse or cripple the Persian administration, and so tend to defeat the objects for which the advance is made, and even to impair the prospects of its repayment. If Secretary Sir E. Grey should be of this opinion they would not object to some arrangement which for the time being would leave a portion of the surplus customs icceipts to the Persian Government, provided that interest at least is paid on the advances, and that theie is some guarantee for the proper expenditure of the portion so lett. i • i o My Lords will be ready to consider any proposals on this point which Secretary Sir E. Grey may wish to make, and they will add the following observations. The surplus receipts of the southern customs are stated to be little more than 6,000/. a month Of this the charge for interest on the advance of 200,000/. now contemplated will absorb nearly 1,200/, a month. If the whole of the balance (viz. 4,800/. a month) were appropriated say from the 1st April, 1913, for interest on and repayment of t e advance of 140,000/. already made, this advance would not be repaid before the end ot two and a half years, say in the autum of 1915 and meantime only interest on the advance of 200,000/. would be provided out of the customs receipts.

In reality, one of the causes ® formation of the present Cabinet was the hope entertained of the fulfilment ol 1 a promise, and, indeed, since the formation of the Ministry I have repeatedly reminded you verbally of this question, and have heard you confirm that promise. I he utmos that you and your colleague stated was that the settlement of the loan question depended upon the arrival of the representative of the syndicate which had to anange the loan ; but you agreed to the immediate need of the advance, and recognised the difference of opinion between my Government and the Russian Legation my Government expecting a sum of 600,000Z. in view of the parity of the amount with the instalments of the future loan; while the Russian Legation thought the paj men of that amount difficult—but as at the time the question of the concession oi the Julfa-Tabriz Railway, and the option of the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway were under discussion, mv Government afforded first a satisfactory termmaLion o mse questions, and did not refrain from rendering an _ assistance which it considerea to be hevrvnd its snhere of dutv.

This question has een raised by the ^bociete d Etudes, who have put forward proposals which are too far-reaching. I should be glad if you would consult your Russian colleague as to what sort of control would be possible. (Repeated to St. Petersburgh, No. 302.) [551-1681CONFIDENTIAL. Sir W.

Delay in making joint advance is attributable to opposition to M. Mornard, whom the Persian Government believe enjoys the support of Russia. It is argued that he is incapable and that it is impossible to get him to present accounts for past expenditure or estimates of the manner in which it is proposed to spend the 400,000Z, Certain members of the Cabinet refuse, for the avowed reasons, to accept advances until it is clearly shown what is to be done with the money. There is good ground for these charges against M. Mornard, but I have urged upon Minister for Foreign Affairs that delay in accepting the advances after pressing so eagerly for them puts the two Governments in invidious position, and that there is serious danger of an increase of disorder if certain payments cannot be made. Although there may be no small justification for charges against M. Mornard, there is little doubt that opposition of Minister for Foreign Affairs and other Ministers is due to a hope that they may thereby be able to handle some of the advances directly, with consequent benefit to their own pockets. Russian Charge d’Affaires and I are agreed that present is not suitable moment to attack M. Mornard, but we are pressing him to be more conciliatory in his demeanour towards Ministers and to furnish information demanded. M. Mornard is by no means fitted for the arduous duties he bas to perform, but it would be very hard indeed to replace him under the present circumstances, when the lives of Europeans are by no means secure, as has been shown by recent outrages. He has certainly done very good work for Persia during the past year, but it is impossible for one man to undertake all the duties he endeavours to perform. There is no organised order in his administration, which is seriously undermanned. (Sent to St. Petersburgh.) U s APFU913 - /■HRSCONFIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley (Tehran). (No. ]73.)

The joint advance is not intended for current expenses^ The Government desires to devote part of it to the payment of arrears of pay which is of immediate necessity. The other portion is to be set aside for the expenses of taking measures for the security of the country. So that the current expenses would have to be met from the existing sources of revenue, the chief of which is the surplus of the customs. If the surplus ot all the northern customs be taken for this advance, it will be impossible to meet the daily and current expenses of the Government, so that it will involve the latter in tresh difficulties, and in view of this fact the Persian Government would prefer to dispense They are very much disappointed. They hoped that m view of the fact that t ey have acted in a most friendly manner and have complied with the wishes of the Russian Government and have taken so great a responsibility on their shoulders (m granting the railway concession), they would be assisted at least in their pressing needs.

It is of great importance to the Persian Government that the advance should be paid in before Friday, the Persian New Year, as disturbances may be anticipated if the demands of certain persons cannot be met by that date. The President of the Council called on me this morning to represent the gravity of the situation. His Highness explained the delay in answering the Russian note was due to the fact that the Government are at a loss to find a way of replying to the expression of a hope on the part of the Russian Government that negotiations will now commence regarding the navigation of the Lake of Urmia without committing them selves to the reopening of the question. Please see my telegram No. 104. Ala-es-Sultaneh said that the Cabinet are most reluctant to commit themselves to the discussion of the question, as, apart from the responsibility they would assume before a Medjliss for so doing, the concession belongs to a private individual, and they are opposed to giving monopoly of the navigation of the lake to a Russian company. I advised his Highness to accede to the Russian request in general terms, but I would venture to suggest that since the Russian demand has become in a sense a fresh condition of the advance, I should be authorised to make payment of British 200,000/. at once, as the Government will be in a most difficult position if there is no money on New Year’s Day. ■jjMUJipwjraCONFIDENTIAL.

['?] Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom I saw after he had seen the Russian charge d’affaires, told me that he presumed that the Cabinet would accept the proposals, but said that he could not give a definite opinion before consulting his colleagues, more especially as the Russian charge d’affaires had informed him in communicating the proposals that his Government considered that, in consequence of their conciliatory attitude, the Persian Government should agree to take into favourable consideration, with a view to arriving at a satisfactory agreement, the question of a concession to Julfa-Tabriz Railway Syndicate for navigation of Lake Urmia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that it would be impossible to persuade the Cabinet to add this concession to the other responsibities that had been assumed. It was raised, he added, when the railway negotiations were opened, and dropped in consequence of the refusal of the Persian Government to negotiate the two concessions at the same time. The Russian Minister told me this at the time, but the Russian Government evidently did not understand that navigation scheme had been dropped, becausethev congratulated the Russian Minister on the conclusion of the railway nego tiations on securing the two concessions, and also thanked the Persian Minister in St. Petersburgh in the same sense. The Russian charge d’affaires assures me that this expression of the desires of his Government will not in any way delay the payment of ad\ ance, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed afraid that the money would not be forthcoming without the promise sought.

The Persian Government is disposed to cause lighthouses to be built and buoys to be placed on or in the neighbourhood of Persian islands, to be determined later in agreement with the British Government on the following conditions: firstly, British engineers shall be engaged by Persia to carry out the construction of lighthouses. 2. On completion of the construction the working and maintenance of the apparatus will be entrusted to British employes specially engaged for the purpose. 3.

MY telegram No. 75 of 11th February aud your telegram No. 79 of 22nd February. You may inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government agree to their proposal that the advance of 200,000L, the British share of the joint advance, should bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent., and be secured on the surplus of the southern customs, be repaid out of the next large loan, and if no loan is concluded by 1st January, 1915, by half-yearly instalments of 50,000L I presume that 50,000b will be paid in respect of each half of the total advance of 400,COOL The advance of the 100,000L for the gendarmerie must be treated in the same way. You state that the total surplus of the southern customs available is 6,000L a month. The interest on the advance already made absorbs 817L a month. The interest on 300,000Z. more will absorb 1,750L, which makes a total of 2,570L a month, leaving at the outside 3,430L a month. Properly speaking, His Majesty’s Government should in the interests of the British taxpayer impound the whole of this surplus to provide for repayment of the advances, hut I recognise that insistence on this course would unduly embarrass the Persian Government. I should be disposed to forgo for the present repayment of the first advance (namely, of the 140,000L) if the Persian Government could give some further security for the repayment of both advances (the 140,000L and the fresh 300,000?.). It seems improbable that the southern customs would bear from 1st January, 1915, the payment of 50,000?. half-yearly, in addition to repaying the 140,000?., or are the Persian Government counting on a great expansion of the revenue ? I am informing the Russian Government that I am accepting the Persian proposals and expressing the hope that they will do the same. &amp; .5T Sir W.

Sir: - I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury Sir L. Mallet's letter of the 15th instant (6173) in which Secretary Sir E. Grey submits proposals for certain further advances tc the p ersian Government and I am directed to make the following re ply. Under the terms of Their Letters (8655/12) of 1st ?f ay and (2839/12) of 9th February last. My Lords agreed to provide £100,000 in all, and did actually transfer to the credit of the Secretary of State £75,000 for the purposes of advances,in conjunction with the Indian and Fuseian Governments, to the Persian Government. They understand that Secretary Sir F. Grey has still in hand out of the latter amount £5000. In these circumstances Their Lordships have given directions for the transfer from the Treasury Chest Fund to the credit of the Vote for Diplomatic and Con sular 16 Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Consular Services of £95,000, which with the £5,000 still in the hands of your Department, will make up the £100,000 required as the British share of the new advance of £400,000 (by Russia India and Great Britain conjointly) agreed to by His Majesty’s Government. Their Lordships agree with the view expressed by the Secretary of State in his telegram No. 87 of February 17th to Sir W. Townley that this advance should be secured, if possible, on the surplus of the southern Customs. They will be glad to know as soon as possible the exEtct terms proposed. They also agree that the repayment of the advances already made should begin from March next if practicable. There remains the proposal for a separate advance (£100,000) for Southern Persia: and on this I am to say that the representations urged by Secretary Sir E. Grey leave them no alternative but to approve this proposal also, on the understanding that, as explained in the letter from the Secretary of State for India of the 18th instant (No. P.568 - 7964) one half of the advance will be made by the Indian Government. Their Lordships will then place £50,000 at the dis posal of your Department as and when required, and the SecretarySecretary of State will doubtless Inform Them at the earliest date what arrangements he is able to propose as to the security and interest for the loan, the ex penditure from which will be subject to the conditions outlined in Telegram Mo, 76 to Sir W. Townley. In conclusion T am to say that while the balance on the Treasury Chest Rand at the present moment happens to be sufficient to enable Their Lordships to advance the sums immediately required - which when add ed to the sums advanced last year will make a total of T 2 20,OOO, - the resources of the Fund are insufficient to admit of so large an amount being left long out standing, I am &amp;c., (Signed) Bobert Chalmers.P CONFIDENTIAL.

I have had great difficulty in inducing the Cabinet to consider conditions attached to advance of 100,0001. for the Ears gendarmerie. It is argued that the Cabinet on takino- office knew they had got to grant two railway concessions and mining concessions, but that they could not discuss any other conditions affecting Persia s national status until the Medjliss has assembled. ^ On my representing the gravity of the situation which would be created were no funds available for the maintenance of the gendarmerie, and after discussing the matter three times in the Cabinet Council, the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me yesterday that he thinks an arrangement as to the control over expenditure m accordance with your wishes can be made. , . . , . There will be no difficulty in arranging that the purchases for the gendarmerie shall be put up to open tender, but it will be very hard to secure other conditions suggested by the British consul-general at Bushire. „ , i , . I have urged that an arrangement that will enable a programme for the lignti g and buoying of the Gulf, which will entail leasing of parts of certain islands, is ol sucli immediate importance that it would be impossible to await the problematical summoning of a Medjliss, and I added that I knew that His Majesty s Government attached great importance to this condition. . + The Minister for Foreign Affairs promised again to urge the acceptance of this condition on the Cabinet, but said that the right to police Persian waters of the Gulf involved greater responsibility than the Government can assume. He also begged that the question as to British protection of the Bahreims and subjects of the trucial chiefs might stand over. He asserted that Persia has no intention of ahenatmg any isla in the Persian Gulf to any foreign Power, either now or in the future, and he authorised me to take official act of this statement, which, he said, cannot be inserted in a written ^Thtre is no source of revenue in Fars which could be regarded as suitable security for theTan, though the treasurer-general is of opinion that such may be coated when order is re-established.

J ^ Their Lordships are doubtless aware that in 1911 Mr. Smart, acting British consul a,t ohiraz, when returning to his post with an escort of 100 men, was attacked and wounded by tribesmen on the Shiraz road. For some days it was doubtful whether he or the British Indian force which was sent to his succour would be able to return to o iraz, and the circumstances of the outrage seemed to point to the necessity of sending a military expedition of several thousand men to punish the tribesmen and keep the roads open. r _ This course was strongly recommended by the Secretary of State for India, by His Majesty s Minister at Tehran, and by the British resident in the Gulf. As their Lordships will perceive from the correspondence noted in the margin,! Sir E. Grey was opposed to it as, in his opinion, it is a policy which might lead to the permanent occupation of bouthern Persia and to the partition of the country, and involve His Majesty’s Govern ment in very heavy expenditure. Events disproved the exaggerated fears which were at first entertained, and Mr. Smart and the British detachment having reached Shiraz m safety, it was eventually agreed that His Majesty’s Government should accept the assurance offered by the Persian Government and trust to their efforts and to the organisation of the gendarmerie under Swedish officers for the restoration of order. _ It should be noted, however, that it was not considered safe to withdraw the British Indian cavalry detachment from Shiraz, owing to the danger to which it would be exposed on the road to Bushire. Since that date the gendarmerie has made considerable progress, as will be seen pom Sir W. Townley’s despatch No. 264 and Major O’Connor’s telegram No. 213, J but it not yet in a position to make its influence felt.

The Persian Government havings made the following proposals to the two legations respecting the mode of repayment, security, and interest, m reply to the Russian offer of an advance of 200,000Z. on the same conditions as the last one :—- The advances shall bear interests at 7 per cent, per annum, shall be secured respectively on customs receipts of the north and south, and shall be repayable out of the loan which it is hoped will be concluded shortly.

Should these receipts not suffice for the purpose, the present Government undertakes to make good any deficit out of other sources of revenue. It is asserted that the Government does not propose to use any part of the advance for administrative purposes, but that it is essential that current revenue, of which customs surplus forms an important part, should be devoted to expenses of administra tion, and the Persian Government’s [group undecypherablej it must not be left free to devote proceeds of the advances to certain constructive projects. It is hoped that, if this important source of revenue is not impounded for repayment of advances for two years, much real progress may be made. The Minister for Foreign Affairs assert that the Cabinet are of opinion that ad vance on the same conditions as the previous one can serve no useful purpose, and that it should not be accepted. After much hesitation, my Russian colleague has consented to telegraph ^ to St. Petersburgh. in the above sense, but he says that he is sure that the Russian Government will not accept the proposed method of repayment.

I have sketched roughly to Minister for Foreign Affairs conditions under which His Majesty’s Government are disposed to advance 100,000Z. to Persian Government for special services connected with Fars. His Excellency expressed himself as quite ready to come to an arrangement on line suggested. Before proceeding further I would venture to submit certain observations on the proposals. 1. I am strongly of opinion that any financial assistance rendered to the gendarmerie scheme should be kept quite apart from any help that may be given for ^ administration of promise, in spite of the fact that two schemes dovetail into each other and the one stands a poor chance of success without the other. 2. I have expressed myself badly if I have caused you to understand that I do not agree that Governor-General should have force of his own. I am of opinion that such a force is most necessary. Where O’Connor and I disagree is on question as to foreign officers for that force. He is in favour of British officers. I consider Swedish officers or officers affiliated to gendarmerie are more desirable. I have suggested Colonel Merrill, an American, who stayed on after Shuster lefh O Connor concurs in this suggestion, but wants him to be seconded from gendarmerie. This seems to me undesirable, though his work would be obviously of an independent nature. 3. Gendarmerie budget in Fars is estimated at close upon 8,0001. a-month, and administration budget at rather more than the same figure, so that it is evident that sum would not suffice for all purposes. I think budget should be prepared 2 e . re h but amended bv officer commanding, Shiraz, in concert with financial agent and British consul, and that money should he paid under my sanction through the treasurei-general to colonel commanding here for transmission to Shiraz. This would ensure suitable and effective control. I am of opinion that the 100,000£. should be set aside for gendarmerie, to be paid in monthly instalments and, say, 30,000L be advanced separately foi U ar ® administration to enable Governor-General to carry on till end of June, or earmarked out of the advance of 200,000Z. Minister of the Interior is of opinion that all efforts ot Persian Government should be turned to the restoration of order in the sout . 4. Question as to proper security and interest is receiving attention, but I fai to see why the Russian Government should object to advance being secured on oan, as the increase to nearly double its present strength of the Cossack brigade is to be made as soon as the loan is issued. _ , , 5. I consider money devoted to the formation of a strong force under t e Governor-General’s orders can justifiably be held to have been expen e or e purpose of securing order on trade routes, because, as stated above, gen aimene an , local force must co operate in suppressing disturbances and brigandage. 6. Governor-General is most anxious to receive your answer to request forwarded in my telegram No. 34 for 2,000 rifles and ammunition, as he cannot proceed with training of his recruits without the arms.CONFIDENTIAL V Sir Edward Grey to Sir W.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs has sent note to the two legations pointing out that it is of the utmost importance that the Persian Government should know within a week the decision of the two Governments in the matter of the conditions attached to advances, and adding that they cannot accept the same conditions as were attached to the advances last March respecting repayment out of the customs. I am of opinion that if it is really intended to help the Persian Government it can only he done by giving them two years’ grace before calling upon them to commence repayment of advances. I have also good reason to believe that they are aware that they can get advance of at least 200,000£. from other British sources if given a free hand to borrow the money.

Sir, Af y^c^tclxyfq^ With reference to your letter of the 25th February 1913, No. 8569, as to the proposed advances to the Persian Government, I am directed to inform you that the Secretary of State for India in Council agrees that it is advis able to accept the proposal of the Persian Government as stated in the 2nd para, of Sir W. Townley's telegram No. 79, dated the 22nd Feb. 1913. Bis Lordship would suggest, however, with reference to corresj ondence ending with my letter of the 12th Feb. last, No. P. 348, that, in addition to the earmarking of &lt;£30,000 for the administration of Pars,for which Sir E. Grey proposes to stipulate, a further sum of £10,000 might be earmarked for similar purposes (and primarily for the restor ation of order on the roads) in the Province of Kerman. 7 A With regard to the question raised in the 3rd para, of your letter, Lord Crewe would suggest 2/f the postponement until the t 28th March 1913 March 1915 of the date on which, under the arrangement agreed to in Mr. Abrahams' letter of the 31st May 1912, No.P. 1914, repayments of COPY TO INDIA | SUCRE TARY‘S NMjJLof capital on account of the sum of 68140,000 advanced in 1912 are to commence. This suggestion, it may be observed, would meet the view expressed in Sir W. Townley's tele gram No. 88, of the 3rd March 1913; and its adoption, as pointed out in Sir ff. Grey's telegram to Sir W. Tovmley No. 107, dated 6th March 1913, would reduce the charge upon the surplus revenues of the Southern Customs from March 1913 to December 1914 to some c82565 a month only, thus leaving a considerable margin r* ' Him#! 11 ISii viz:- for other purposes.

You may inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government agree to their proposal that the advance of 200,000L, the British share of the joint advance, should bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent., and be secured on the surplus of the southern customs, be repaid out of the next large loan, and if no loan is concluded by 1st January, 1915, by half-yearly instalments of 50,000Z. I presume that 50,000L will be paid in respect of each half of the total advance of 400,COOL The advance of the 100,000L for the gendarmerie must be treated in the same way. You state that the total surplus of the southern customs available is 6,000Z. a month. The interest on the advance already made absorbs 817Z. a month. The interest on 300,000Z. more will absorb 1,750Z., which makes a total of 2,570Z. a mouth, leaving at the outside 3,430Z. a month. Properly speaking, His Majesty’s Government should in the interests of the British taxpayer impound the whole of this surplus to provide for repayment of the advances, but I recognise that insistence on this course would unduly embarrass the Persian Government. I should be disposed to forgo for the present repayment of the first advance (namely, of the 140,000Z.) if the Persian Government could give some further security for the repayment of both advances (the 140,000Z. and the fresh 300,000Z.). It seems improbable that the southern customs would bear from 1st January, 1915, the payment of 50,000Z. half-yearly, in addition to repaying the 140,0001, or are the Persian Government counting on a great expansion of the revenue ? I am informing the Russian Government that lam accepting the Persian pioposals and expressing the hope that they will do the same.

I HAVE had the honour to receive your despatch No. 206 of the 26th October, requesting my views on the proposals contained in the despatch dated the 15th September from His Majesty’s consul-general at’Bushire on the subject of the financial adminis tration of Southern Persia. In his despatch to the Government of India, copy of which is enclosed in the above- mentioned despatch, Sir P. Cox proposes that an informal local committee should be established consisting of the governor, the director of customs, the resident, and the local manager of the Imperial Bank, in order to ensure that, as far as may be possible, a sufficiency of funds from the customs receipts and the local revenues collected by the customs may be forthcoming to meet the needs of the local administra tion, while discouraging irregular and wasteful expenditure. 1. The Bank Loan Convention of 1911 stipulates that no charge other than a specified sum for the service of previous loans, and the expenses of the upkeep of the local customs administration, should be payable from the southern customs receipts before the monthly instalment of the service of the loan has been met. It is to be regretted that, unlike the Bussian Bank’s agreement with the Persian Government where the approximated expenses of the northern customs administration are given a fixed figure, in the Imperial Bank’s convention the amount is left undefined. Consequently the bank has a moral right to assure itself that any sums paid out by the customs officials are legitimately on account of upkeep, and in case ol dispute on this point, or as to how far capital outlay— e.g., the erection of a new customs house or the refitting of the vessels engaged in the prevention of contraband—-may be considered as upkeep, such a committee as is proposed could usefully arbitrate. 2. If Sir P. Cox’s proposal contemplates concurrence in any disbursements out of customs receipts, other than for the bare needs of the Customs administration, before the service of the loan is met, I should deprecate such a course. Before the Bank Loan Convention, certain items, often alluded to as the quasi-fixed charges, had, with the acquiescence of His Majesty’s Government, priority oyer the service of the then existing loans, but in view of the above-quoted express stipulation of the 1911 convention, the draft of which was approved, I believe, by the^ Foreign and India Offices, and the conditions taken note of in a letter from the Foreign Office published in the prospectus of the loan, it seems to me out of the question to encourage or coun tenance any breach of these conditions. If this contention concurs with } our views, Sir P. Cox’s proposed committee could only deal with disbursements out of the surplus customs receipts and the local revenues collected by the Customs as agents of the treasurer-general, which are now, I understand, to be kept in separate accounts. The first practical step the committee could take would be to determine the amount essen tially necessary for the preservation of order in the Gulf ports, and what proportion of this amount should be chargeable to the surplus customs receipts. ^ When this is fixed, it should be insisted on that in the event of the further pledging of the Southern Customs receipts, whether on account of advances on the part of the Imperial Bank, oi of guarantees desired by the Mohammerah Railway Syndicate, or of part guarantees offered to the contractors of the projected big loan, this amount should have priority over the services of such new financial obligations of the Persian Government. It will be remembered that in March next His Majesty s Government resume the right of appropriating all the surplus customs receipts for the repayment o the recent advances made to the Persian Government. It is to be piesumed t at His Majesty’s Government will not wisb to cripple the local administration, and will at most exact such surplus as will leave provision for the urgent needs of the governor. It would be in determining the amount of such provision and supei vising its propei application that the proposed informal committee could insinuate a beginning of contro with the least ground for objection on the part of the central authorities.

Tehran, February 22, 1913. {February 22, 12'45 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 87 of 17th February. Southern customs receipts amount to about 14.0001. monthly. This sum has to meet (1) service of the Anglo-Indian loan, which will now amount to 2,500b a-month, and (2' interest on bank loan, viz., 5,200b a-month. This leaves a surplus of little more than 6,000b a-month, without making any allowance for other charges customarily met from this revenue. His Majesty’s Government have advanced 140,000b to the Persian Government; if, therefore, they decide to appropriate the whole surplus, the repayment will take about two years, during which this revenue will be unavailable as security for even the interest on the new advance, which would amount to over 1,000b a-month. If His Majesty’s Government will be content to appropriate only a proportion of the surplus, paragraph S of my despatch No. 238 suggested a procedure which you have under consideration. a COPY TO IND'A 2 S “A 1 b i 13 .. ii.lllliUllltiU.t. &gt; &lt;■' 'CONFIDENTIAL. r i 9 ; 3 J N?V W.

The Persian Government liavHagt.made the following proposals to the two legations respecting the mode of repayment, security, and interest, in reply to the Russian offer of an advance of 200,0007,. on the same conditions as the last one :— The advances shall bear interests at 7 per cent, per annum, shall be secured respectively on customs receipts of the north and south, and shall be repayable out of the loan which it is hoped will be concluded shortly. If the loan has not been made before the 1st [group undecypherable] January, 1915, advances to be repaid by half-yearly instalments of 250,000 tomans \say 50,0007.) each out of the surplus of the northern and southern customs receipts commencing on the above-mentioned date. Should these receipts not suffice for the purpose, the present Government undertakes to make good any deficit out of other sources of revenue. It is asserted that the Government does not propose to use any part of the advance for administrative purposes, but that it is essential that current revenue, of which customs surplus forms an important part, should be devoted to expenses of administra tion, and the Persian Government’s [group undecypherablej it must not be left free to devote proceeds of the advances to certain constructive projects. It is hoped that, if this important source of revenue is not impounded for repayment of advances for two years, much real progress may be made. The Minister for Foreign Affairs assert that the Cabinet are of opinion that advance on the same conditions as the previous one can serve no useful purpose, and that it should not be accepted. After much hesitation, my Russian colleague has consented to telegraph to j St. Petersburgh in the above sense, but he says that he is sure that the Russian Government will not accept the proposed method of repayment.

I understand that he has made a communication to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this sense. Treasurer-general thinks that, as his Excellency is most anxious to conciliate Russia, advance may he accepted without demur, hut he has himself urged that only a specified sum out of the surplus of the northern customs should be redeemable each half-year. He hopes by this means to free himself from the state of servitude towards the Russian Legation and Russian Bank in which he found himself last year, and which, he says, was becoming intolerable.

YOUR telegram No. 76 of the 12th February. I have sketched roughly to Minister for Foreign Affairs conditions under which His Majesty’s Government are disposed to advance 100,000Z. to Persian Government for special services connected with Fars. His Excellency expressed himself as quite ready to come to an arrangement on line suggested. Before proceeding further I would venture to submit certain observations on the proposals. 1. I am strongly of opinion that any financial assistance rendered ^ to the gendarmerie scheme should be kept quite apart from any help that may be given for administration of promise, in spite of the fact that two schemes dovetail into each other and the one stands a poor chance of success without the other. 2. I have expressed myself badly if I have caused you to understand that I do not agree that Governor-General should have force of his own. I am of opinion that such a force is most necessary. Where O’Connor and I disagree is on question as to foreign officers for that force. He is m favour of British officers. I consider Swedish officers or officers affiliated to gendarmerie are more desirable. I have suggested Colonel Merrill, an American, who stayed on after Shuster left. O’Connor concurs in this suggestion, but wants him to be seconded from gendarmerie. This seems to me undesirable, though his work would be obviously of an independent nature. 3. Gendarmerie budget in Fars is estimated at close upon 8,000L a-month, and administration budget at rather more than the same figure, so that it is evident that sum would not suffice for all purposes. I think budget should be preparedL here, but amended bv officer commanding, Shiraz, in concert with financial agent and British consul, and that money should be paid under my sanction through the treasurer-general to colonel commanding here for transmission to Shiraz. This would ensure suitable and effective control. I am of opinion that the 100,000£. should be set aside for gendarmerie, to be paid in monthly instalments and, say, 30 , 000 L be advanced separately for Fars administration to enable Governor-General to carry on till end of June, or earmar e out of the advance of 200,000Z. Minister of the Interior is of opinion that all efforts ot Persian Government should be turned to the restoration of order in the south 4 Question as to proper security and interest is receiving^attention, but 1 fail to see why the Russian Government should object to advance being secured on loan, as the increase to nearly double its present strength of the Cossack brigade is to be ma e as soon as the loan is issued. . „ , ^ 5. I consider money devoted to the formation of a strong force under the Governor-General’s orders can justifiably be held to have been expended for the purpose of securing order on trade routes, because, as stated a ove, gen aimen local force must co operate in suppressing disturbances am ngan age. -i j 6.

My Russian colleague has not yet received any instructions from his Government upon the subject of interest, security, and eventual repayment of the proposed advance to the Persian Government of 200,000b I anticipate that the same conditions will be to Persian Government, who maintain that it is no advantage to them to pay 7 per cent, for the advance of their own money for such a short period, more especially as they believe that they can obtain more satisfactory financial assistance by means of this security on less onerous terms from other parties. Of course the situation would be greatly altered were there reasonable prospect to anticipate that a large loan will be negotiated at an early date. I have not been able to see the treasurer-general since receiving your telegram under reply, but I can think of no reliable security for the interest of the advance but the southern customs surplus, and I can only suggest repayment from the same source should be delayed for a specified period pending the issue of a loan. It would also be desirable that His Majesty’s Government should now declare whether or no the surplus of the southern customs is to be detained from March on for the repayment of advances already made. attached to the new advance as were attached to that of last March, namely 7 per cent, interest, repayment out of the projected loan and security of the surplus of the northern customs receipts, such surplus to be devoted to repayment of the advance as it becomes available.

His Excellency therefore hopes that you will induce British group to send a representative to Paris. Minister of Finance told me a few days ago that he had only consented to advance of 200,0001. to Persian Government because of strong pressure brought to hear on Minister for Foreign Affairs by His Majesty’s Government. He, personally, believed that this money would be squandered, and that in a few months’ time Persian Govern ment would ask for more. On my referring to question of large loan, his Excellency said that he foresaw almost insuperable difficulties in the way of its realisation. French financiers wanted to give the loan a first lien on northern customs, and to this Russian Government could never consent, as those customs were pledged as a guarantee for Russian loans. Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom I repeated this, said he believed a more careful study of receipts of northern customs would convince Minister of Finance that, without surrendering the prior claims of Russian loans, there would remain sufficient surplus to serve as a partial guarantee for proposed large loan.I ^3 'll dl * Very Pressiiag.

That, subject to any observation you may have to offer, the gendarmerie budget should be drawn up by Swedish commanding officer at Shiraz, and^ agreed to by His Majesty’s consul and the financial agent in consultation, and, when this is done, that all actual payments should be made by the Swedish commander; . 3.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 13, 1913.) (No. 269.) • 7 oo -.mo gj r Tehran, December 23, 1912. UPON' the receipt of your telegram No. 691 of the 26th ultimo, informing me that a sum of 15,000/. had been placed to my credit at the Imperial Bank of Persia for the purpose of assisting the finances of the administration of Pars, I consulted the treasurer-general as to how best this money could be deposited in the bank in such a manner as to secure its being devoted to the purpose tor which it was intended, and so as to offend as little as possible Persian susceptibilities, that are apt to be tendei when an effort is made to control the expenditure of money advanced to the Government on which interest has to be paid. After a verbal exchange of views with M. Mornard, and some private corre spondence, which resulted in a letter from him dated the 1st instant, c A °Py w ^ lc y- 18 enclosed, I had a private conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs 1 then addressed a note to his Highness on the 10th instant, copy of which I have the honour to enclose, informing him that His Majesty’s Government had consented to make a further advance to the Persian Government of 15,000/., upon the same conditions as the previous advances made during the present year, to meet the pressing financial requirements of the province of Pars. By arrangement with Ala-es-Sultaneh, 1 sent his Highness the same day a memorandum privately, copy enclosed, explaining tie arrangement made with M. Mornard for the control of the expenditure of this money. I on the same day addressed a letter to M. Mornard confirming the arrangement made Bank. I the Governor of the 10th December. Acting upon ^ — - — 0 I subsequently sent a cheque for the 15,0001. to the treasurei-general. I have he honour k transmit herewith a copy, of his reply, hpect-S money, and enclosing a copy of his letter ol instruction to the bank respecting the '^rfhekS 1 oTXjor O’Connor at Shiraz, he at once proceeded^ the discussion of the financial situation It of t/iftefegran, that Mukhber entertains but little confidence in the Belgian officials.

Mornard has assured me that M. btas, ttie Belgian age , ^ [2763 n—6] ’■4- ■i areach Shiraz in a few days, is an especially conciliatory person, who has always succeeded in getting on well with Persian officials. From the tenor of the last telegram, dated the 20th instant, copy enclosed, from Major O’Connor, reporting a conversation with the Persian representative of the treasurer-general, it would appear that he has formed a good opinion of this man, to 1 whom he gave valuable advice as to the manner in which the finances of the province should be handled. I have approved Major O’Connor’s language used on this occasion. The 20,000 tomans referred to constitutes the first instalment drawn from the 15,000Z (say 82,000 tomans) advanced by His Majesty’s Government. I sanctioned its transfer to the Bank of Shiraz at the request of M. Mornard, who was pressed by the Government to send money to Shiraz to meet the immediate expenditure likely to be required for the expedition to punish the authors of the Dastarjin incident. I have advised Major O’Connor that this money can only be spent with his approval. In conclusion I would venture to state that I am strongly of opinion that it would e unwise and unfair to meddle with M. Mornard’s plans until it has been proved that they are doomed to failure. Were we to insist upon a British financial agent at Shiraz a situation would be created that would react disastrously in the north, where M Mornard s officers have to contend against the opposition of the local authorities who in many cases receive the open support of the consular officers.

Regarding financial agent: Governor-General had already spoken to me very plainly of his distrust of treasurer-general and Belgian employes in general With regard to treasurer-general’s local agent, he says he does not object to the principle of general supervisory control of finances by European agent, but he thinks attempt by Europeans to exercise direct executive functions over collection of revenue will inevitably lead to friction m the province. He dwelt on the need for elasticity in system, and necessity of considering local prejudices and susceptibilities, especially in view of present weakness of Government and lack of material force to support executive. He fears European might desire to insist on too rigid a system, and might prove too little amenable to Governor-General s advice m difficult and delicate cases. He is, however, prepared for his part to try to work in harmony with the new agent, and in answer to your message m^m Unde I reply 7 he ^f cl f es . he has already done his best to place his relations with M Mornard on a friendly footing, and that you may rest assured no friction will arise between him and finance office here if he can possibly prevent it. At the same time I can see that he profoundly dislikes idea of Belgian agent, upon whose personality and tact much will now depend. Simdar sentiment seems to prevail here, and there is a threat of agitation against Stas on his arrival on the part of principal land-owners and tax-pay e rs.Enclosure 8 in No. 1.

Mirza Mustapha Khan, inspector of finances in Ears, called on me last night to bring me telegram from Mornard, in which he is instructed to examine Governor- General’s budget scheme for expenditure of borrowed money during the next three months, and to^show it to consul before telegraphing it to Mornard. Telegram also states that the sum of 20,000 tomans will be sent. Mustapha Khan knows nothing about this latter sum, but presumes that it must be intended to meet extraordinary expenses of Governor-General’s measures to punish the perpetrator of the recent outrage. Inspector also showed me summary of budget prepared by the Governor-General. It consists merely of list of lump sums under various headings amounting in all to 99,000 tomans, and inspector is not aware how the total was arrived at, and whether the Governor-General has made any attempt to work the matter out in detail. He, therefore, proposes during the next few days to prepare detailed budget himself. He informed me that there are considerable arrears due to the troops and police J\ er( p&gt; ask&lt; ? whether it would be legitimate to include these in the new budget. I said that 1 thought not as loan of 15,000L was primarily intended to enable the Governor-General so^ to organise his province during the next three months as to start administration m ensuing financial year in such strength that he would be able to collect his revenue and maintain order throuo-hout his province. I therefore advised inspector so to frame budget that its headings should include only such items of recurring and capital expenditure as might be regarded as lying within normal needs of the provincial administration, an that it might constitute model for ensuing years also; and to prepare also supplementary budget for such extraordinary expenses as arrears and special punitive expedition, b unds to meet these latter estimates would be forthcoming partly from 20,000 tomans promised by treasurer-general, and partly from such provincial revenues as m ‘S ht be before the close of the current financial year. If these resources were insufficient, turther grant should be asked for from Tehran. . i i f -t-Vapap lines He Inspector entirely agreed, and has promised to prepare budget on these lines. Me seems to be a sensible man, and has impressed me very favourably. Full details will of course be lelegraphed to you for your approva 1 as soon as I receive them officially. Meanwhile, I trust you approve generally of my advice inspector ft seems (o me that if we allow this 13 0001, or any -nsffierable portimi of it, to be frittered away in purposes which can be of no permanent us . f the money will be wasted and Ears no better off than i w ‘ 1 ' , ,, c expenditure of this sum is so arranged as to place finances and for ^ s f of basis, and to constitute model for future guidance, we shall have laid the foundations real constructive policy upon which to build m futme years. i / t-J. ¥ rf' ; % _ I ^In any further communication on this subject, please quote 3398/13.

The Attack on the 39th Central India Horse. The situation in Southern Persia is far from clear, and the following remarks are diffidently offered, not with a view to proposing a definite measure so much as for the consideration of the various issues. It should perhaps be explained that the term “ British prestige ” throughout this note is not used in any chauvinistic sense, but is intended to describe only the conditions in which British and British Indian subjects can carry on their lawful avocations with reasonable security of life and property. (1.) It is necessary first of all to define the problem with which His Majesty’s Government have to deal in Southern Persia. That problem is, it is assumed, simply the maintenance of order. Not, however, for its own sake—that is the concern of the Persian Government; but because the maintenance of order is essential to the maintenance of British trade, which is essential to the maintenance of British influence. And the maintenance of British influence inland is essential to the maintenance of the British position in the Persian Gulf, which for a century has been the keystone of our policy in the Middle East, as being essential (it has always been assumed) to the safety of India. (2.) This statement of the problem, if it be accepted, seems to meet the suggestion—otherwise plausible—that because Captain Eckford was on a shooting expedition and not on duty, the incident introduces no new factoi. For, from the practical point of view, what His Majesty’s Government have to deal with, is not the murder as such, but the murder in its bearing on the maintenance of order and ulterior consequences 5 and the caidmal question is not what Captain Eckford was doing, but what his assailants thought he was doing. On this point the evidence is conclusive that they attacked him because they thought he was convoying a caravan, he., precisely because they thought he’ was on duty. The incident, therefore, following on the still unpunished attack on the detachment with Mr. Smart a year ago (which m its turn had followed on a similar attack on Mr. Bill and his escort in 1910 ::: '), represents another definite step on the downward grade of British influence ; and the question is whether the point has not been reached at which either measures must be taken which were not thought necessary a year ago, or our whole policy in Southern Persia and the Gulf must be recast. + • 1 Q IS) The Persian Government, at all events, appear to think that a turning point has been reached. It is clear that at last they are really frightened, and are making a serious attempt to do then duty. But tie) have many difficulties—lack of a force; lack of loyal co-operation among those who ought to be leaders; lack of funds unless His Majesty s Government go on lending ; and can we reasonably go on lending money for operations vvhich every one expects will prove abortive, and which we may then have to attempt over again ourselves at further expense (4 ) It is impossible, therefore, to be optimistic as to the chances that the Persian Government will succeed. But most people will wish to give them the chance, even if the necessity of doing so were not forced uponjis by the weather But then one or two considerations suggest themse ves . (i) How long are we to give them? They themselves say one month. W Sir W Townley, with a judicious warning against forcing Mukhber to court disaster by precipitate action says three or four We have seen in the Smart case the evil of allowing a thing of this kind to drag on interminably : it is now over a year since the attack and the Persian Government are no nearer the pum&amp;ffinien of the’offenders. Every day that they remain unpunished, British * These are mentioned only as cases of murderous attacks on His Majesty s troops while on duty. The list of attacks on British officers and subjects in other circumstances is too long to be given here.2 prestige is a little lower among tlie people wlio really mattei, i.e., tlie people in tlie soutli in wliose midst Initisli trade is Ccimed on 5 while the merit, if any, which we acquire with the Persian Govern ment by inaction is not a liquid asset. If His Majesty’s Government are eventually going to do anything, there must be a reasonably short time-limit. Nature has fixed a limit of about three months before action can, and five months after which it cannot, most advantageously be taken, the middle of March to the middle of May being the best times formarching up the Bushire-Shiraz road. On all grounds it would seem desirable to choose the earlier date, for if a force is to go, it should have plenty of time before the approach of hot weather makes operations difficult. If then it is to arrive at Bushire by 15th March, the Government of India must be instructed not later than the end of January, which would thus be the time-limit to give the Persian Government. # . . . (ii) Although we have not much choice as to giving the I ersian Government a chance, it must be borne in mind that, if the) fail, the situation is pro tanto worse, and it will be the more difficult for His Majesty’s Government to do nothing. Not only because of the loss of prestige, but because the actual ferment that there will be in Pars if the tribes succeed in frustrating this stupendous effort of the Central Government will force action upon us in defence of British life and property. Much more, therefore, than the mere question of reparation hangs upon this venture. (5.) If, however, the Persian expedition is successful, it is probable, as Sir W. Townley observes, that the Governor-General’s prestige will lie pgitifelisiied, and order generally restored, not only on that road but else where In such circumstances it might be practicable as a military opera ion, and possible without too great loss of prestige, for the 39th Central India Horse—though with somewhat bedraggled plumage—to find its way unaided to the Coast; and oar troubles would be ended, so far as it is concerned. (6.) But if it fails, what courses will be open to His Majesty’s Government ?— (A.) To wait for the situation to develop—a course the disastrousness of which has been shown (as observed above) in connexion with the Smart incident, and which is from every point of view to be deprecated. (B.) To accept blood-money, a handsome apology, and such efforts as the Persian Government may have made, and to wipe the slate clean. There is much to be said for this course on its own merits, and if the only question at issue were reparation. But wiping the slate clean unfortunately provides no solution for the other difficulties of the situation. Even supposing it were practicable—and reason has been given above for thinking that a Persian defeat would force action on His Majesty’s Government—we should still be left with the problem of getting the regiment away, and of the ultimate restoration of order, which the Persian defeat would indefinitely postpone. There would appear to remain only the three courses ■which were discussed a year ago :— (а) A British punitive expedition, such as the Consul at Shiraz has all along urged, the Government of India and the India Office have always opposed, and Sir W. Townley now T regards as inevitable. It would be superfluous to repeat the objections to this ; they have been stated more than once by this Office and by the Government cf India. The objection on the score of expense is perhaps the least of them—for it may well be argued that it is less unjustifiable to spend the Indian taxpayer’s money on measures wTiicli we know will be effective than to fritter it away in loans which so far have served no purpose. (б) The course first proposed by the Government of India, and accepted b) Sir Edward Grey and then abandoned by both, of sending up two brigades3 to effect the complete evacuation of Shiraz, civil and military. Before they abandoned this proposal the Government of India realised (what had been pointed out by this Office and by the Director of Military Operations) that what we evacuated someone else would occupy; and it is indeed obvious that this policy means the final withdrawal of Great Britain from Southern Persia, for it is certain that having thus retired we could never go back. Here we come in touch with the other question now under discussion with the Foreign Office, the fate of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession, and the issues arising out of it. If Southern Persia could be isolated, there would undoubtedly be much to be said for cutting our losses, and concentrating upon the only part of the country that is really vital, politically and strategically, to India—the British sphere. But Southern Persia cannot be separated from the Persian Gulf. The control of the Gulf means the control of the coast, and the influence that is supreme in the hinterland is that which will ultimately be supreme on the coast. Personally, I am not convinced that—quite apart from the future of Southern Persia—the trend of events is not in the direction of the complete extinction of British power in the Persian Gulf in the course of the next 20 years. We shall have to face the inevitable consolidation of Turkey as an Asiatic power at the head of the Gulf, more and more jealous of her rights and capable of asserting them. Behind Turkey Germany pushing forward her economic, and, therefore, political interests'^', along the Bagdad Railway to the sea. In Arabia the possible development of forces which may easily absorb our thin line of allies and squeeze us off the coast. The growth of inter national commerce in the Gulf itself which, if the Bagdad Railway ever reaches it, will become an international highway where the_ prescriptive rights of one nation will in practice receive scant recognition. And in Persia the growth of Russian power pressing down towards the warm water. Against all this (it it has any real existence) we have very little to set, and I venture to think that there will be a growing disinclination to stake anything very important upon the maintenance of our interests there. For example, Lord Lansdowne’s famous declaration of 1903, which in effect made the establishment by a foreign power of a naval base in the Persian Gulf a casus belli,—what is the probability that Canada and the other; dominions (if admitted to the control of foreign policy) would allow us to go to war, even if we wanted to, now, on that question if limited to the Gulf properly so called P,! or even to redeem our pledges to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Moham- mera, if by any chance Germany should appear in shining armour beside Turkey in opposition to those two potentates? At a meeting of the Defence Committee last year—of the proceedings of which there is no full record—Lord Nicholson, if I remember rightly, threw out the opinion that it did not matter very much what happened in the Gulf. And in fact it does not matter vitally,' on two conditions, (i) that we have a strong naval base ft the mofth of 'the Gulf, or a sufficiently strong naval force within reach, and can seal it when we will; (ii) that we allow no Power to come down to the coast of Persia at Chahbar (in the British sphere) or anywhere outside th6 These considerations may have seemed to stray rather far from the immediate issue, but they are not irrelevant to my point, which is twofold, viz (i) that we cannot deal even with the immediate issue without raising the whole question of the British policy in those regions ; (n) that if we are to confine ourselves to the vital necessities, political and strategical, of India and the far East, it is possible to sacrifice the Gull as well as Southern Persia, on certain indispensable conditions. A hether the advantages so far outweigh the many disadvantages as to make it expedient is another matter. t Lord Lansdowne’s declaration was in fact loosely worded. He had in mind more especially Chahbar, which is outside the Gulf, and is so near to India that we should have no alternative at any time but to resist its occupation. » Since the above was written a consular report has been received which shows that the bmce tne aot / whose relations with the German Government are well known) ^^“l^imioits^a the Gulf to Bagdad and Basra by 100 per cent, last year; while the ierman firm ofWonckhaus (trading by what the Board of Trade call “ unsound methods ) xported inoi'e wheat than all the British firms put together, and made a profit of 30,0001.f 1 T i le course suggested by the Government of India at a later stage— the despatch of the necessary force to withdraw the regiment only, to which this Office attached the condition that the force should be strong enough, and its commanding officer free, to follow up and punish his assailants if he wpre attacked • but it was common to both that there should be no general punitive operations. This proposal is no doubt rather speculative The idea would be that the force in fact would be opposed, that it would do a oood deal of damage on the way up, that it would demonstrate to the tribes men (what we know from our officers, who have travelled among them since aftqpk on Mr Smart, needs demonstrating) that they have not yet defeated the whole Indian. Aijmv, and that British prestige would m this way so far he restored that, when the force reached Shiraz, it would be possible for it to bring away the cavalry with something like eclat, leaving the Consul behind with a slightly enlarged escort. In the meantime part of the force would have stopped at and occupied the Kazerun plain, from which point it would maintain order up and down the road. It would then he for the PersiantGovernWnt to step into the void that would be created when the * force slowly withdrew. This would of course he a half measure. We could not be hertain thtlt the same conditions would not be set up again at the next tribal migration—though, by the retention of a sufficient force at Bushire for sometime, the risk of this might he minimised {see also paragraph 7 below). Itlis a half measure: but the only whole measures are a punitive expedition and, or, complete equation. The force which the Directof Operations thought necessary in January last to safeguard Shiraz, make g^osNfhe lines of communications, and carry out such punitive operations as might he found neccssai\, was Two mixed brigades of infantry, each to include a pioneer regiment. Two Indian Cavalry regiments, including the regiment already at Shiraz. Two or more batteries of mountain artillery. One field company of Sappers and Miners, with the necessary admini strative services. J ' We are advised that the same force (approximately) would be required for all these measures. (6.) It should he added that either (a), (6), or (c), being military operations, the consent of both Houses of Parliament would have to be obtained'before any part of the cost could be charged to Indian revenues, g (7.) But nothing that His Majesty’s Government or the Persian Govern ment can do will permanently restore order in Southern Persia unless the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf is destroyed. This point has not hitherto received the attention it deserves, and has been treated mainly as a domestic trouble of the Government of India. The Government of India have now (for the time being, at all events) destroyed the trade with the north-west frontier (which is all that directly concerns them) by maintaining a naval blockade in the Gulf at their own expense (amounting to over half a million sterling) ; and this expense has been forced upon them by the exigencies of Imperial polic3 r , because, on the one hand, the entente makes it difficult to take a very strong line against France, and, on the other hand, the refusal of the Colonial Office to cede Gambia deprives us of the price which will buy France completely out of Muscat. Indorum iniuriae Indis curae. But the Persian aspect of the question is one for His Majesty’s Government, and it is quite certain that so long as the tribesmen can draw practically inexhaustible stores of ammunition from the Gulf, so long will disorder reign. It is essential, therefore, that—whether by bargaining or by other means — a settlement with France should be pressed through to a conclusion as a matter of real urgency. 6th January 1913. 4 A.

We certainly do not propose to make any separate advance ourselves for general purposes, but desire to join with Russia in advancing for general purposes a sum not exceeding in all 250,0O0L from each of us respectively on conclusion of railway concessions. We are, however, confronted with necessity of re-establishing order on trade routes in the south. Attacks on British officials and the murder of a British officer give us ample justification for doing this by dispatch of a British force, but we much prefer, as an alternative, to advance money to enable a Persian governor to restore order by improving gendarmerie or allocating some force to protection of trade routes. Any advance that we made separately for this purpose, or any share of the joint advance that we made in excess of the share advanced at any moment by Russia would be given solely for this purpose, and under conditions that would enable its expendi ture to be controlled by us and limited to this purpose.1 Sir Edward GreyM) Sir G.

In a letter of the 1st May their Lordships agreed to a further advance of J00,000f., of which 50,0001. was to be provided by the Imperial Government in such instalments and at such times as the Secretary of State might wish, and a sum of 25,000L was transferred to the diplomatic vote as a first instalment. In order that the Persian gendarmerie in the neighbourhood of Shiraz should not be crippled for want of funds, a sum of 2o,000Z. was placed at the disposal of His Majesty’s Minister in August last, one-half of which was provided by the Government of India, and an advance of 10,000L was forthwith made to the Persian Government. On the 24th October His Majesty’s Minister, acting on instructions from the Secretary of State, placed the balance of 15,000/. to the credit of the treasurer-general, on condition that this money should be spent on the requirements of the gendarmerie in the province of Ears. j • i +i.

Sir \\ .

Two different loans are discussed:a loan of £100,000, made by the British Government in May 1913 to the Governor-General of Fars (half of which was to be payable by the Government of India), to be utilised towards the maintenance of law and order in southern Persia (specifically in the form of subsidies to be paid to the Fars gendarmerie), and proposed in response to a number of recent attacks on British forces, including the murder of Captain Eckford of the 39th Central India Horse, near Shiraz in December 1912;a joint Anglo-Russian loan to the Persian Government, to the value of £400,000, divided equally between Britain and Russia, with the Government of India paying £100,000 towards the British Government’s share of £200,000.The correspondence deals with arrangements for the payment of the loans, conditions attached to them, the agreement of terms between the British and Russian Governments, the date of commencement of interest repayments.Amongst the conditions discussed are:protection of and provision for British interests in the Persian Gulf, namely Persia’s responsibility for the supply of lighting and buoying in the waters surrounding Persian islands, and protection for Bahrainis and Trucial Coast subjects in Persia;loan interest rates;security against the loans, and repayment of loans, in the form of Persian customs receipts, and opium receipts;mining and railway concessions in Persia, pursued by British and Russian interests.The volume’s principal correspondents are: Sir Walter Beaupre Townley, British Minister at Tehran; Sir Arthur Hirtzel of the India Office; Sir Louis Du Pan Mallet of the Foreign Office; Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The volume’s core correspondence covers the period January 1913 to February 1914. The earlier start date given for the volume is a result of correspondence included in a secret memorandum on Persian Government loans (ff 13-38), itself dated 17 October 1910, which is an historical précis of loans given to Persia by the British Government and Government of India since 1903.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Russia</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shiraz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Fars</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Law enforcement</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000f8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
