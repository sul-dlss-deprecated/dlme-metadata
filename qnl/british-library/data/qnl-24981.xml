This was declined, and it was not until the Turkish troops had evacuated Lahej that the British force returned to Aden. The right of the Porte to request the withdrawal of the British troops was at the same time expressly denied by the Secretary of State for India, “ since the relations of the British Government with the tribes round Aden are independent of Turkey, whom we do not admit to have any locus standi in that region.” In the same year (1873) Her Majesty’s Am bassador at Constantinople informed the Porte that Her Majesty’s Government would not tole rate the interference of the Ottoman authorities in the territory of the nine tribes, and this declaration has been repeated several times since. The intrigues and interference of the Turkish officials nevertheless continued in the following years, and in 1885 culminated in a more decided forward movement, resulting in the occupation of Jalela, in the heart of the Amiri country, and several other villages belonging to the Amir of Dthali. Her Majesty’s Government protested against this occupation, though Jalela was not men tioned, but the Turks were in strong force at the time, and nothing more was said than that Her Majesty’s Government could not acquiesce in the indefinite occupation of the Amir’s villages. In the autumn of 1885 the whole subject of our relations with the Aden tribes was discussed, and certain proposals were made which were referred to the Government of India. These proposals w'ere to the effect that, of the nine tribes, the four nearest to Aden (the Abdali, Subaihi, Akrabi, and Padhli) should he placed under British protection by Agreements con cluded with the Chiefs; that Agreements should be concluded with the Haushabi and Alawi and with the Lower Yaffai, binding them not to sell their territories, or accept the domination of any other Power; that the Upper Yaffai and the Aulaki should be left independent; and that as regards the remaining tribe—the Amiri—we should quietly desist from our present attitude of opposition to the Turks, allowing the absorp tion by them of the hamlets on the uplands, and possibly pensioning off the Amir and his imme diate successors.3 Secret despatch, August 6, 1886. Secret despatch to India, December 9, 1887. Foreign Office to India Office, November 19, 1887. The Government of India in 1886 expressed themselves in favour of these proposals, but recommended that Treaties should also be entered into with the tribes occupying the coast eastwards between Aden and the limits of Muscat, so as to exclude all chance of foreign interference on the seaboard. Owing to negotiations on other matters proceeding at Constantinople, no action was taken till the end of 1887, when the Government of India were authorized to proceed with Pro tectorate Treaties with the Akrabi, one of the nine tribes, and wuth the Wahidi and Mahri, two tribes on the coast to the east of the Aulaki and outside the nine tribes. As regards the substitu tion of a Protectorate form of Treaty for one binding the Chiefs not to sell their territories or accept the interference of any other Power, Lord Salisbury expressed the opinion that “ the responsibility incurred by the British Govern ment in either case is much the same, while a Treaty of Protectorate gives a more complete control and is more efficient to counteract inter ference by foreign Powers than the less definite Agreement previously suggested.” In 1890 Protectorate Treaties were ratified with the Fadhli, Akrabi, Lower Aulaki, and certain Atifi and Bashemi sections of the Subaihi, and also with the principal Chiefs along the coast, east of the Aulaki, as far as the Muscat frontier; in 1895, with the Haushabi, Alawi, and Lower Yaffai; in 1903 and 1901, in consequence of the difficulties experienced by oar Com missioners during the work of delimitation with Sultan Khatan of the Upper Yaffai, and with three sections'^ of that tribe, with two Sheikhs representing the Upper Aulaki,-j* and with the Chief of Behan-el-Kasab ; and in 1905 (after the completion of the delimitation) with the Amiri As regards the Abdali, the fact that the terri tories of the Sultan were already under British protection was recognized in an Agreement of 1882. In 1900 a Turkish subject erected a fort at Ad Dareja, in the Uaushabi territory. Diplo matic representations proved unavailing, and a force had to be sent from Aden in July 1901 to expel the intruders, who were assisted in their resistance by Ottoman troops. Further en croachments in Amiri territory were reported, * Dthali, Mausatta, and Muflahai. f Yeshbum and Nikb.4 and in October 1901 the Government of India suggested a delimitation of the frontieij an independent proposal to the same effect being made almost at the same time by the Ottoman Government. The proposal was accepted, and the Commis sioners met at Dthali, the chief village of the Amiri, in February 1902. The British Com missioner was Colonel Wahab, R.E., of the Survey Department of the Government of India. He was familiar with the country, having carried out surveys in 1891—92 as far north as Dthali. It transpired, however, that the Turks had utilized the interval before the Commissioners met to occupy with regular troops and artillery a number of points in Amiri territory which had hitherto been in the possession of the Sheikh, among others Jalela, which they had previously occupied in 1885. They also established irregular Arab levies over a great part of the Amiri terri tory, terrorising the natives and making them believe that Turkish rule was to he established. Inflammatory religious appeals against the British were also circulated. The Turkish troops and levies had orders to prevent any British party from moving about for purposes of survey or inquiry, and persons attached to the Commission were actually fired on. The British escort at this time consisted of only 150 men, while the Turks had, apart from levies, over 800 regulars and eight guns on the Dthali plateau in the immediate neighbourhood of the British camp. His Majesty’s Government protested against these encroachments without result, and eventu ally. to ease the situation, it was proposed in June that the delimitation of the Amiri country should be postponed, and that the delimitation of the country of theYaffai (another of the nine tribes), lying to the north-east of the Amiri, should be proceeded with. This led to no result, as though the Turkish Government professed to accept the proposal, the Commissioners on the spot received instructions not to recognize the Yaffai as one of the nine tribes. A complete deadlock ensued, the Turkish Government being unable or un willing to control their local authorities. In these circumstances it was decided, on the recommendation of Sir N. O’Conor, that Mr. Eitzmaurice, second dragoman of the Embassy at Constantinople, should be appointedto the Demarcation Commission as Joint Com missioner. He was acquainted with the attitude of the Turkish Government at Constantinople, and it was anticipated that his command of the Turkish language and experience of Turkish officials and methods of business would render him a valuable colleague to Colonel Wahab. He ioined the Commission at Dthali at the end of November. In December 1902, His Majesty’s Govern ment reluctantly decided that it was necessary to send up troops to support the Commission at Dthali and to reinforce the Aden garrison from India. Four hundred men and four guns were accordingly sent early in January 1908 to Dthali, and reinforcements were sent from India to Aden. In order to prevent the arrival of Turkish reinforcements at Hodeida, His Majesty’s ships “ Hermione ” and “ Intrepid” were sent to Aden from the Mediterranean. By May the force on the Dthali plateau and on the com munications had been increased to about 1,500. These proceedings had a good result. Orders were sent from Constantinople in February which caused the local authorities to modify their attitude, but it was not till towards the end of March 1903 that the levies were finally dis banded, and the Turkish forces withdrawn behind the line which His Majesty’s Govern ment had claimed provisionally for the Chief of Dthali, leaving Jalela in his possession. With this withdrawal of the Turkish troops the preliminary difficulties disappeared, and delimi tation, in the proper sense of the word, may be said to have begun—thirteen months after the meeting of the Commissions. Though organized obstruction ceased with the withdrawal from Jalela, it was some time before the excitement created in the tribal country ceased, and progress was at first slow. However, in May 1903 it was possible to with draw the ships. In June a proper survey of the Amiri border was completed, and the British pro posals as to the general line to be followed by the demarcation were referred to Constantinople. In September and October the Shaibi country up to the Wadi Bana was surveyed by the Joint Com missioners, and a line agreed to and demarcated. In October the actual demarcation of the Amiri country was begun by the Joint Commissioners, the doubtful points as they arose being settled [249] 0which, the Ottoman Government claimed as part of their district of Rada, but they were con sidered by His Majesty’s Government, on satis factory evidence, to be connected with the Yaffai, and thus to fall within the British Protectorate. On the 23rd September Sir N. O’Conor reported that, at a farewell audience before he left Constantinople, the Sultan opened the conversation by assuring me that he would give his formal consent to the Aden frontier delimita tion next day.” This undertaking, however, was not observed. On the 25th October Lord Lansdowne found it necessary to instruct Mr. Townley to inform the Porte that His Majesty’s Government proposed to send a ship of war to the coast to watch over British interests, and the Admiralty gave orders to the Commander-in-chief on the East Indies Station to send a ship. On the 28th October Mr. Townley reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs begged that the dispatch of the ship might be delayed, and promised an answer by the 3rd November. On the 4th November Mr. Townley telegraphed that the Sultan’s reply had been handed to him in the shape of a telegram to the Turkish Ambas sador for communication to Lord Lansdowne, but that, having regard to the terms, he had refused to act on it. On the same day the Turkish Ambassador presented the reply to Lord Lansdowne. It spoke of the line proposed for the Subaihi border as a “ marked encroachment,” claimed Habiani, Nawa, Juban, and Rubeaten as “belonging incontestably to the Kaza of Rada,” and begged for a reopening of the question. Lord Lansdowne replied by reciting the Sultan’s promise of the 23rd September and the failure to give effect to it. He said it was “outrageous that at the last moment an attempt should be made to reopen the question;’’ and that the arrangements for sending a ship of war to the coast, which had been suspended at the Ambas sador’s special request, would certainly now r be carried out. The “ Proserpine ” arrived in the Red Sea on the 6th November. On the 30th December Mr. Townley reported that an Irade had been issued instructing the Turkish Commissioners to draw the boundary outside Bab-el-Mandeb to Kudam (the Vilayetof the Yemen retaining Turba and the wells, as also the territory bounded by a line terminating at Sheikh Mirad). The wording of this Iradd betrayed complete ignorance of the question, and also stated that neither Government was to he allowed to send troops into the Nine Cantons. No mention was made of the delimitation of the boundary north-east to the desert, but a promise was given that no portion of the territory would be ceded to a third Power. His Majesty’s Government decided that the stipulation as to the dispatch of troops to the Nine Cantons was inadmissible, and Mr. Townley was instructed to press for compliance with the original demands, including the recognition of the north-eastern frontier. (To Mr. Townley No. 3, Telegraphic, of the 9th January, 1905.) The Turkish Ambassador was also informed that, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, the Porte were acting in a most unreasonable manner. (To Mr. Townley, No. 27, of the 18th January.) On the 7th Pebruary Mr. Townley was instructed to inform the Porte that His Majesty s Government took note of the new Irade, and of the Porte’s intention not to send troops into the Nine Cantons, but that His Majesty’s Govern ment would reserve to themselves their indis putable right to send Pritish troops there when and wherever they pleased. On this under standing His Majesty’s Government were ready to demarcate the line from Mudariba to Sheikh Murad, but should fresh difficulties be raised by the Porte, His Majesty’s Government would be obliged to decline all further negotiations, and would take their own measures for defining the line they considered it necessary to claim, and for maintaining their rights over territory included in it. (To Mr. Townley, No. 41.) At Sir N. O’Conor’s suggestion, His Majesty’s Government later consented to drop all reference to the dispatch of troops into the Nine Cantons. His Majesty’s ship “ Perseus ” was ordered to Turba, in order to give her moral support to His Majesty’s Government’s efforts to arrive at a settlement, and on the 14th March Sir N. O’Conor was informed by the Porte that instructions had been sent to the authorities of the Yemen for the delimitation of the frontier of the Subaihi from Mudariba to Sheikh Murad, as also for the prosecution of the delimitation of the frontierbetween the Yaffai and the Yemen, from the Bana Biver north-east to the desert. On the 21st April Sir N. O’Conor reported the signature of the proces-verbal, and Mr. Pitz- manrice was congratulated on the snccessful issue of the negotiations. The proces-verbal, after reciting the boundary as far as the Wacli Bana, defined on the signed maps, states, as regards the frontier beyond the Wadi Bana, that it was generally in a line north east from Lakmet-es-Shah to the desert; that the whole of the Aulaki and all districts of the Yaffai (including Rubeaten, Nawa, and Dabiani) lying to the south and east of the line to ti e desert belong to the nine tribes. It is silent as to Bohar, with which we have a Treaty and which we regard as Aulaki; and also as to Beda, with which the Resident at Aden was authorized to conclude a Treaty, which, however, has not yet been executed. Beda is apparently neither Aulaki nor Yaffai, but is reported to lie south of the line north-east to the desert. » In order to place officially on record the settlement which had been arrived at, Sir N. O’Conor proposed (despatch No. 396 a of the 10th June) an exchange of notes, to which were to be attached copies of the maps showing the frontier as finally traced by the Joint Com mission, and of the proces-verbal exchanged at Sheikh Said between the two Commissioners. This proposal was approved, and Sir N. O’Conor was instructed to insert in the British note a paragraph to the effect that the actual demarca tion of the frontier north-east from Bana was to be postponed to a more favourable moment. (To Sir N. O’Conor, No. 225, of the 11th July.) A map of the frontier delimitation is annexed.
