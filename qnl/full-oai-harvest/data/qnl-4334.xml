They are routine notifications of minor amendments to regulations and procedures governing the appointment, pay, pension and other conditions of service of Government of India employees, such as their entitlement to leave and travel expenses, their contributions to the General Provident Fund and other Indian Civil Service family welfare funds.Finance Department circulars in the file amend several regulations, including the Civil Pensions (Commutation) Rules and the Central Subordinate (Inferior) Services (Gratuity, Pension and Retirement) Rules, 1936.Although the majority of Finance Department circulars in the file concern amendments to regulations about personnel, there are also several which amend regulations governing the keeping of public accounts and control over government expenditure.A few Finance Department circulars contain Customs notices prohibiting the importation into British India of the following books published in England, 1935-1936:
