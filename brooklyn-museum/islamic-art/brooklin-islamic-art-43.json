The text includes a collection of prayers for the Prophet, a description of his tomb, his names and epithets, and other devotional material. It became the center of a popular religious brotherhood, the <i>Ashab al-Dalil</i>, which revolved around the mystical Islamic practice of <i>dhikr</i>, or recitation, of this book of religious piety. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis manuscript is an Ottoman copy of al-Jazuli&rsquo;s text, opened to an illustrated page containing a depiction of Mecca. Situated at the center of the mosque courtyard, the Ka<span style=\\\"font-size: smaller;\\\"><sup>c</sup></span>ba&mdash;the focal point of Muslim prayer&mdash;is marked for recognition by its black and gold cloth, while Ottoman-style minarets punctuate the surrounding walls.
