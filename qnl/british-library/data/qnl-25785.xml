YM.I.1./628. 25th October, 1939. An Dear Gt6^&lt;5U-/ , With reference to our telephone conversation this morning, we have received the following remarks from the Ministry of Supply on Government of India Telegram No.551 dated 7th October, 1939, to the India Office, which included a list of certain requirements which had been submitted the Iranian Consul General. 'The Telegram from the Government of India relating to the supply of Industrial Dynamite, Detonators and Calcium Carbide, required by the Iranian Government has been considered in the Ministry of Supply and it is recommended that the Iranian Government should put forv/ard their requirements as follows (a) As regards Industrial Dynamite and Detonators through the ordinary channels of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., v/ho can, no doubt, obtain an export license in due course. (b) As regards Calcium Carbide to the British Oxygen Company - also a commercial proposition. It is considered that the amount of the supplies involved is not enough to prejudice the needs of British services and that in due course no objection need be taken by this Ministry to the supplies required being furnished'. 2. It appears to me that it may be worth while transmitting this information to India for communication to the Iranian Consul General, as I know we are anxious to supply Iran from this country in cases where this is found/ J.P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, S.W.l.found to 'be possible. It is noted, however, that the Government of India Telegram was only sent for information and that no suggestion was made therein of supply from the United Kingdom; it would appear however, that the information obtained from the Ministry of Supply should be forwarded to India if you agree. Yoursfile copy C FOREIGN'OFFICE, S.W.1. ctober, 1939. (E 6877/864/34) My dear Gibson We notice that in their telegram No* 551, of the 7th October of which a copy was sent to us under cover of India Office letter p.Z. 6295/39 of the 10th October, the Government of India remark on the ’’unusual nature’’ of an enquiry received from the Iranian Ministry for Industry about the supply of dynamite. As you know, the Iranian Government are at present engaged in extending the Trans-Iranian Railway, and the demand, which seems to our inexpert eyes to be simply for blasting materials, does not seem to us in the circumstances to be in any way out of the ordinary. As you know, we are at present most anxious that the Government of India should afford as much help as possible in the matter of railway supplies to the Iranian Government. RECd. POL.

The request is passed from the Iranian Consul-General to the Government of India, Department of Supply, who refer the matter to the Foreign Office out of concern for what they feel is an 'unusual' demand.
