POLICE OFFICE, ADEN, 7th Lay 1936. TO The Civil Secretary A d e n, Subject:- Proposal for the creation of the post at With reference to your- No.C/428 of 28th February 1936 which ms In reply to my No.70S of 27th January experienced, in the Armed Police owing to the fact that there are only 4 Inspectors, two of whom are always on the islands. I will not reiterate the arguments for an increase f one officer but would submit the most economical proposal that I can think of to overcome a very real difficulty I would like to Invite your attention to the position as it actually will bo in a few day's time. The two Arab officers are on the Islands, leaving an Indian and a Jomaii officer .: Aden The Indian Officer has applied for leave and when he goes I shall be left with one Somali officer in charge of a mixed force of Arabs, Indians and Somalis at Armed Police Headquarters. If he 'goes sick' or if an Island relief takes place as it roust during the period of the Indian officer's leave., thex‘e will be no officer at Headquarters. I very strongly recommend - indeed I consider it absolutely essential - that, at the least, a post' of Jamadar be created. a Jamadar in the Aden Armed Police. memorandum. 1936, I would like to refer once again to the difficult The/2 im-j permanent raontly cost of this appointment would be K:;.80/~ fixed pay (Unarmed iolice Jamaciaiu, eye on a scale 60-5-110) plus a clothing allowance Of R;h3/5/- . I would further recommend that this officer be available for ar. acting promotion of Inspector when one of the Armed Police Inspectors is on leave. Jbi.fiee tile date that* thore have 'beer 4: Inspec tors vvlt.li tno Armed polio©* the total, uumher of months spent by them on leave has been 20 iaou- hs# This is over a. per rod of 60 i: souths. Hence the average number of months per year that the Jamadar would act would, be 4 months. The difference in the proposed rate of the Jemadar*s pay and the lowest pay of a Junior Inspector is 0,40/-. The average cost of acting per annua would thus be Km 160/-. one Hoad Constable on no45/- per mensem would act for a similar number of norths in the Jamudar ’ s vacancy, the .verm, n annual cost of this acting appointment being Rs. 140/-. I would remark in conclusion that if this proposal he accepted, it not only solves a very great difficulty but provides a direct promotion link, at an estimated cost of only ru1300/- per annum which not only encourages efficiency but is a means of training of lower grades for Inspectorship. 3d/- R.H.
