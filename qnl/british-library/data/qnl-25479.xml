T have been thinking over suitable candidates but, as you know, an Englishman with a good knowledge of German, and at the same time of high commercial standing, is a 'rara avis'. The person whom I should like to put forward as suitable for Sir E. Grey to recommend is Sir F. Oppenheimer, who, as you know, is our commercial at- tach£ in Berlin. He is one of the few people posses sing the requisite qualifications. But I hesitate to do this until I know if his name would be agreeable to the interested parties in Germany, and my object in writing to you is to ask if you would be so kind as to give me, quite privately, your personal views onthe idea. The other British director would prohahly he someone connected with the Ottoman Navigation Company, hut he, I fear, would not he a great German scholar.

It is understood that the authority to navigate Lake Beyshehir shall in no way interfere with any existing rights in connection with the irrigation works deriving their supply of water from Lake Beyshehir. Article 2. It is understood and agreed by and between the “English” Company and the “ German ” Companies as follows :— 1.

Grey to Prince Dichnowsky. Foreign Office, Your Excellency, June , 1914. On signing the Anglo-German Convention respecting the Bagdad Railway, &amp;c., I have the honour to state that the undertaking of His Majesty’s Government in Section I of the Explanatory Note also covers the guarantees necessary to compensate the Company for the revenues which had been allocated for the purposes of the Railway, but, owing to the Balkan war, may no longer he available for such purposes. This assurance is subject to the proviso that His Majesty’s Government retain such freedom of action as will permit the British Delegates at the Financial Commission at Paris to criticise the details of any scheme which may be put forward in regard to the allocation of specific revenues. In default of some such reservation, the German Government will readily appreciate that the position of the British Delegates at Paris might be rendered difficult in the complicated questions likely to come up for discussion. E. G. L. No. 2. Draft of Note from Prince Liclmowshy to Sir E. Grey. Kaiserlich Deutsche Botschaft, (Geheim.) London, den Juni 1914. Euerer Excellenz, Bei Unterzeichnung des deutsch-englischen Abkommens uber die Bagdadbahn und verwandte Fragen beehre ich mich, mit Beziehung auf Artikel 3 (c) des Abkommens und Abschnitt III der ihm beigeffigten erklarenden Note, Folgendes zu erklaren. Falls nach Vollendung der Bagdadbahn von Chanekin bis Basra englische Unternehmer oder [340] ?1? the view of securing that the principle of open competition shall be upheld in regard to contracts or concessions for future works of irrigation in Asiatic Turkey. Ilis Majesty’s Government will not oppose a minor German participation in any contracts or concessions which may be allotted to British subjects, provided • that such participation is deemed commercially desirable by the parties holding the said contracts or concessions. In agreeing to this arrangement, I desire to bring to your Excellency’s knowledge the following clause in an agreement concluded between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government, which should in no w T ay be prejudiced by the terms of this note :— “ En tant qu’il s’agit de travaux d’irrigation a executer par le moyen de canaux se raccordant directement an Chatt-el-Arabe, il est toutefois entendu qu’ils ne seront pas autorises par le Gouvernement Imperial Ottoman sans avoir regu 1’approbation prealable de la Commission fluviale. Celle-ci aura le droit de surveiller les travaux dont il est question pour qu’ils soient executes conformement aux plans et devis autorises.” I have to add that His Majesty’s Government will raise no objection to the irrigation of the plain of Adana (for which, by virtue of existing agreements with the Ottoman Government, German subjects have already carried out considerable preliminary work) being definitely conceded to German subjects, and that they will not support any claims which may be advanced by British subjects to compete in regard to this enterprise. I understand that the German Government will furnish to His Majesty s Govern ment an authentic list, indicating accurately the area and scope of the works in question. No. 5.

Grey unobjectionable: they have been embodied, after discussion with Herr von Kuhlmann, in a fresh revise, which will be forwarded to you as soon as printed. The change in regard to the Kut-el-Amara Mendali line is much more serious, and Sir E. Grey has caused the German Ambassador to be informed that he must hold the German Government to the wording proposed in the memorandum enclosed in His Excellency’s note of March. 23rd, and agreed to by His Majesty’s Government in their note of April 3rd. Copies of both these notes are enclosed for facility of reference. A ; O ^ UN 1914,r The Under Secretary of State, India Office. % ■ &gt;(24887/14) A copy of a further note from Prince Lichnowsky, respecting Section I of the Explanator:/ Note, is also enclosed. I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,The German Government propose as the German text of the Bagdad Agreement and the explanatory note r f the wording in the accompanying drafts. The respective texts (Alternat) should he drawn up in such a way that in the copies intended for Germany, both in the German and English texts, Germany should come first, while in those intended for England, both texts should mention England first. The German text corresponds with the English wording as far as possible. There are dis crepancies however in regard to the following points: 1. The provisions respecting publications of alterations in the conditions of transport and freight rates on the Bagdad Railway have not been placed in the explanatory note but under No.Ill in Article 2, Clause a. of the Agreement, as the provisions respecting publication form part and parcel of the Bagdad Railway^ agreements is Excellency Sir E.Grey, Bart., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.agreements with the Porte, in the same way as the re maining provisions of Article 2, clause a, while there is no ground for referring to them in the explanatory note. Should the British Government agree to this modi fication as it is to he assumed they will, the intro ductory words 'In regard to Article 2 clause (a) (II)' will have to he omitted and in Article 2 clause h. the reference will have to he to suh-clause V. instead of to suh-clause IV. 2. In Article 3, clause c, at the end, the words 'as defined in the explanatory note attached to the pre- i sent Convention' have not been translated. It is de sirable that this sentence should also he omitted from the English text, as it is superfluous, and indeed not quite accurate in that the explanatory note does not it self define the extent (Begriff) of the Bagdad Railway i system, hut merely indicates the Bagdad treaties in which the extent is defined. 3. Article IV, clause c. which is somewhat in- - volved in wording, has been put in a simpler form in the German text, without any alteration of the sense. We would urge that the English text should follow us in this respectrespect and that it should he worded somewhat as follows; 11 hereby agree, so far as concerns themselves, that the Bagdad Railway Company's rights under Article 9 of the aforesaid Convention shall cease on the completion of the construction of the Bagdad Railway to Basra, as stipulated in the arrangement referred to in Article 2 of the present Convention'. 4. In Article 5, paragraph 2 the words 'eine Un- mittelbare Oder mittelhare unterschiedliche Behandlung' have been inserted in place of the words 'eine unter schiedliche Behandlung' so as to correspond with the form of words used elsewhere in the Convention. A cor responding modification of the English text is desirable. 5. In Article 8 the annex has not been referred to as 'No,!* since, so far as is known, the Convention will only have one annex. As the 'heads of agreement' are not in two languages but have only been agreed upon in the English language, the addition of a German translation will be unnecessary (wird sich eriibrigen).{zsj In the English text of the third (fourth) section of the explanatory note, the word 'to' should be omitted in line 2* .i.he Imperial Government suggest the following wording for the note respecting Mendeli: 'At the time of the signature of the Anglo-Gerraan Con vention respecting the Bagdad Railway and kindred questions, I have the honour to make the following declaration with reference to Article 30 of the Convention and Section III of the explanatory note annexed thereto: Should it happen that, on the completion of the Bagdad Railway from Ghanekin to Basra, English contractors or the proposed Ottoman River Shipping Company express the wish, through the medium of the British Government, to construct a railway from Kut-el-Amara or some town in its neighbour hood to Mendeli via Bedrai, the Imperial German Government will not raise objections to the construction of such a feeder-railway either on the ground that the railway is more than 100 km. in length or on the score that Mendeli lies within the protective zone of the Bagdad-Khanekin railway. The railway must however neither be prolonged beyondbeyond Mendeli nor taken to the Persian frontier either from Mendeli or from another point, unless a full agreement in regard to such prolongation has previously been arrived at between the German and British Governments. The Imperial German Government attach importance to this note remaining secret until further notice and desire that it should not be published without their express con- sent.

I have now been instructed by my Government to offer the following remarks in regard to the extension of Section 1 of the Explanatory Note referred to in No. 4 of Your Ex cellency’s note as well as in regard to the draft of a confidential note from Your Excellency to myself, as given on page 15, No. 1, of the confidential print of May 29th, 1914: The Imperial Government attach great im S portance to extending the scope of section 1 of the Explanatory Note. They feel that they must insist on the Important provisions of Article 1, clause a,of our Agreement being interpreted not only from the negative His Excellency Sir E. Grey, Bart., &amp;c., &amp;C., &amp;C.negative but also from the positive standpoint According to statements made by financial ex perts the Paris Financial Conference has nothing to do with the securing, for the Bagdad Pailway, of fresh guarantees out of existing Turkish revenues or of revenues now to be created in agreement with the Great Powers. The task of the Conference is limited rather to providing suitable compensation for the loss of financial guarantees resulting from the ces sion of the European territories of Turkey. The following text is therefore proposed for paragraph 4 of section 1 of the Explanatory Note: 'Nevertheless His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment will not oppose the Bagdad Pailway Company in securing out of the existing revenues and the new revenues forming the object of the negotiations now pending between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the Powers, the requisite fresh guarantees to enable the Company to complete the line.' If Section 1 of the Explanatory Note is modified in the sense proposed above, the German Government are ready to agree with Your Excellency’s proposal that special notes should be exchanged on this point andand in regard to Article 1 clause a. of the Conven tion. These notes could he treated as confidential or non-confidential, according as Your Excellency wishes. The note from Your Excellency to myself, marked No. 1, should in our opinion run as follows: No. 1. y Draft of Note from Sir E.Grey to Prince Llchnowsky.

Foreign Office, Your Excellency, June , 1914. On signing the Anglo-German Convention respecting the Bagdad Railway, &amp;c., I have the honour to state that the undertaking of His Majesty’s Government in Section I of the Explanatory Note also covers the guarantees necessary to compensate the Company for the revenues which had been allocated for the purposes of the Railway, but, owing to the Balkan Avar, may no longer be available for such purposes. This assurance is subject to the proviso that His Majesty’s Government retain such freedom of action as will permit the British Delegates at the Financial Commission at Paris to criticise the details of any scheme which may be put forward in regard to the allocation of specific revenues. In default of some such reservation, the German Government will readily appreciate that the position of the British Delegates at Paris might be rendered difficult in the complicated questions likely to come up for discussion.

GREY presents his compliments to Hakki Pasha, and has the honour to communicate to his Highness herewith the text of article o, clause (c), of the draft Anglo-German Agreement respecting the Bagdad Railway and cognate matters, and section 3 of the explanatory note to he annexed to the convention. _ Hakki Pasha is aware that His Majesty’s Government are at present opposed to any railway connection with Egypt from the east, hut, m the event of this view being modified at some future date, or of any concessions being granted for railways to the Persian Gulf south of the limits indicated in point 1 of the explanatory note, section 3, His Majesty’s Government rely upon the Ottoman Government, in view of the cordial relations existing between the two Powers, granting them only to a British group agreeable to His Majesty’s Government, and only allowing the construction under conditions acceptable to them. Having regard to the fact that His Majesty’s Government have made no small sacrifices in agreeing to article 3, clause (c), of the above-mentioned convention, in the desire principally to facilitate the negotiations between Germany and Turkey, they would much appreciate a written assurance on the subject from the Ottoman Government. gjj. Grey would also draw the attention of Hakki Pasha to the fact that, alter the completion of the Bagdad Railway, the River Navigation Company, in which the Ottoman Government are important shareholders, will be deprived of much ol the lucrative through traffic it will at first enjoy, and will to a large extent be dependent upon local traffic. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government trust that the Ottoman Government will grant, in favour of the Navigation Company, an option for ten years, to date from the completion of the Bagdad Railway to Basra, for concessions for short lines of railway as feeders for the river navigation; such feeders may be a large source of income to the Navigation Company, especially if irrigation work proceeds as rapidly as anticipated in Mesopatamia, and Sir E. Grey would specify a line extending for 100 kilom. on either side of the Tigris, and joining the river at Kut-el-Amara, as one line which will probably eventually be desirable. Foreign Office, May 4, 1914.Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from Draft Anglo-German Agreement. Article 3. Clause (c). His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment declare that they will in no case themselves establish, or support any claim by any persons or corporations whatsoever to establish, in Ottoman territory, railway undertakings either in direct competition with the Bagdad Railway Company’s lines, or in contradiction with that company’s ^existing rights, unless-and until there is complete agreement on the subject between the Imperial German Government and His Britannic Majesty’s Government. For the purposes of this article, the western terminus of the Bagdad Railway system, as defined in the explanatory note attached to the present Convention, shall be held to be at Konia and the eastern terminus at Basra. Section III. In regard to article 3, clause (c), of the Convention, it is agreed to as follows :— 1. No lines in that part of Asiatic Turkey which, west of the 36th meridian of east longitude, lies south of the 34th degree of latitude and/or in that part which, east of the said meridian, lies south of the 31st degree of latitude, shall be held to be in direct competition; but any line north of these limits shall be held to be in direct com petition if it establishes direct railway communication between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. 2. There shall be a protective zone extending for €0 kilom. on either side of the lines of the Bagdad Railway system, and any line passing within the said zone shall be held to be in direct competition, provided that in the region between Museyib and Kurna the protective zone shall be bounded on the east by a line drawn midway between the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, from the latitude of Museyib to Kurna. 3. Local lines serving as feeders for the river navigation and not exceeding 100 kilom. in length shall, provided they do not pass within the protective zone, not be held to be in direct competition. 4. The question of whether any other line is or is not in direct competition shall, in the event of failure to reach an agreement, be referred to arbitration in accordance with article 10 of the said Convention.[12 ] Mr M- ' (si) In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote India.

Your Excellency:- The draft of an Anglo-German Convention respecting the Bagdad Railway of April 21st, 1914 has been under the consideration of the Imperial Govern ment. Under instructions from my Government I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Imperial Government agree to the draft in the main, hut they would suggest certain small modifications on the following points:- 1. Article 2, Clause a, No. 2 of the draft does not quite coincide, in point of form, with the corresponding article of the Convention to oe con cluded between the Bagdad Railway Company Q^d the Porte. In the Turco-German draft it is stated that 'La Societe du Chemin de Per de Bagdad confirme qu'elle continrara comme oar le passe a appliquer a toutes les marchandises etc. un regime parfalternant egal'. The Right Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart., K.G.,egal'. This wording makes it clear that the assent to exclude all differential treatment corresponds with the practice hitherto observed by the Bagdad Railway Company. On the other hand the wording of the Anglo- Crennan draft might give rise to the idea that a prohibition is necessary in order to do away with hitherto existing differentiation. In order to avoid this impression the Imperial Government would recommend that No. 2 of Article 2 Clause a. should run somewhat as folio /s, so as to fit in with the Turco-German draft: 'The Bagdad Railway Company confirms that any discrimination direct or indirect shall be excluded permanently as hitherto on the Bagdad Railway system as regards facilities, etc.' 1 2. The desired stipulation concerning the publication of alterations in the tariff has already been included in the draft Convention between the Bagdad Railway and Turkey, so that there is nothing to prevent a corresponding clause being inserted in the explanatory note. The French text; of the iurco- German draft runs as follows:- w La Bociete du Chemin de fer de Bagdad consent, en outre, a ce que les delaisdelals fixes par 1'article 21 tie son lahler des dhargei touchant les avis prealaPles a dormer en cas de modi fication des conditions ou des prlx des tarifs, soient imiformernent portes a deux mois. Oes avis seront inseres (tans le Journal Official du Oouvernonent Imperial ottoman at dans le Journal de la onambre de Commerce Ottomans de Constantinople.' 3. In consequence of the suppression of No. 2 in article 4 the numbering of the first paragraph should be cancelled, and for similar reasons the indication 'clause a* in Article 3 should be cancelled. 4. Section 1 of the explanatory note should be completed by the addition of sentence to the effect that the British Government will not oppose the financial safeguarding of the Bagdad undertaking by the hypothecation of existing Turkish revenues or of any new revenues which may be Introduced by the negotiations now in progress.

Minute by Mr. Parker. HERR VON KUEHLMANN spoke to Sir E. Crowe and me about irrigation works in Mesopotamia on Saturday. He said tbe Herman Grovernment objected to tbe British claim that the sections tendered for by British firms alone in 1912 should now be reserved to British firms r and considered that the principle of open com petition should apply to all works of irrigation. It was pointed out to Herr von Kuehlmann that the Germans had acquired exclusive irrigation contracts in certain districts around Konia, and all we asked now was that British firms should not lose what we regarded practically as a droit acquis in Mesopotamia, for the said firms had alone tendered in 1912, and their tenders had only not been accepted because it was incon venient at that time for the Ottoman Government to embark upon such expenditure. He then urged that if the British firms did not get the definite contracts all they could claim would be compensation for their out of pocket expenses m tendering in 1912 : to this we pointed out that the British firms had expended brains as well as money in 1912, and we saw no reason why out siders should reap the benefit of either to their detriment. Moreover, the sections tendered for in 1912 were of relatively small extent, and only formed about one-third of the Willcocks scheme, which did not by any means extend to all the regions capable of irrigation. His Majesty s Government regarded the British claims to carry out the sections tendered for in 1912 as strong, an they must be upheld. As for the rest of the work. His Majesty’s Government had themselves pro posed to Turkey, who had agreed, that the principle of open competition should apply. Herr von Kuehlmann then said that he must ge something, for his Government were rather put out about the German cable question, and he thought if he did get something, even thoug purely formal, it would strengthen his hands m inducing the German Government to abandon the article we objected to about a railway to the sorth of Basra : we pointed out that in any case [2098 y—5]i Copy to 8 MAY 19142 I that article was of recent birth, and did not entitle the Germans to any quid pro quo if they gave it up : in fact it seemed to be objectionable from their own point of view as well as from ours. He persisted that no harm would be done if we said that German firms might have a minor par ticipation in any contracts or coucessions for irrigation we might obtain in Mesopotamia, provided the arrangement were mutual. To this Sir E. Crowe replied that the matter would be considered in consultation with the Board of Trade, but it would be necessary in any case to stipulate that such participation would only be admissible if it were considered commercially desirable by the firms concerned, and that His Majesty’s Government could only undertake “not to oppose ” it. When Herr von Kuehlmann came to see me on the 21 st instant we drew up the annexed article, which I said I would submit to the Board of Trade, in order that they might consider it in consultation with the British firms principally concerned. I would draw attention to the refer ence in clause (b) to the German works of irriga tion in Asia Minor, and to the * first paragraph of clause (a) which extends the principle of open competition to the whole of Asiatic Turkey. The Board of Trade are being consulted. April 22, 1914. A. R * r i iAnnex. Article (a.) The Imperial German Government and His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare, so far as concerns themselves, that they will nphold the principle of open competition in regard to contracts or concessions for the execution of future works of irrigation in Asiatic Turkey. The Imperial German Government declare that they will not oppose a minor British participation in any contracts or concessions which may be allotted to German subjects, provided such participation is deemed commercially desirable by the parties holding such contracts or con cessions. His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will not oppose a minor German partici pation in any contracts or concessions which may be allotted to British subjects, provided such • participation is deemed commercially desirable by the parties holding such contracts or concessions. (b.) It is expressly agreed that the foregoing clause shall not be held to apply to those irrigation works already entrusted to German subjects in Asia Minor, or to those tendered for in Mesopotamia by British firms in 1912.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] r '\ TURKEY.

Article 1. The “ English ” Company and the “ German ” Companies shall co-operate to procure that the Ottoman Government shall: 1. Grant to the “ English ” Company a Concession :— (a.) For the construction of a branch line from Karakouyou to Sandukly. ( 6 .) For the construction of a line from some point on the east shore of Lake Eghirdir to a point on the north or north-west coast of Lake Beyshehir, such railway not to extend further in a southerly direction than the latitude of Kazak Adassy. 2. Grant to the group which has undertaken the irrigation of the Plain of Konia a Concession to construct a narrow gauge “local” railway laid, as far as possible, along the navigation dams, connecting the station of Tchoumra on the Bagdad Railway to the shore of Lake Beyshehir at the Town of Beyshehir, such line to be operated by the Bagdad Railway Company. 3 Grant to the “ English ” Company an authorisation for the navigation of Lake Eghirdir and of Lake Beyshehir and to the “ German Companies an authoiisation for the navigation of Lake Beyshehir. The terms upon which the English Company and the “German” Companies shall be authorised by the Ottoman Government to navigate Lake Beyshehir shall be in all respects identical. It is understood that the authority to navigate Lake Beyshehir shall in no_ way interfere with any existing rights in connection with the irrigation works deriving their supply of water from Lake Beyshehir. Article 2. It is understood and agreed by and between the “English” Company and the “ German ” Companies as follows :— 1. If and whenever the “English” Company or the German Companies shall aoree between themselves and with the Ottoman Government that it is desirable for a i unction to be made between the line to be constructed by the English Company between the Lakes under Article 1 clause 1 (b) and the line to be con structed* by the German group under Article 1 clause 2, that such junction shall be made at Munafer on the eastern shore of Lake Beyshehir. Fading agreement between them, neither the “ English” Company nor the “German Companies shall extend in any direction their respective lines as defined m Article 1 to any other point on Lake Beyshehir. . . n , . . 2. That the “ English ” Company and_ the “ German Companies will enter into an agreement which shall provide, inter aha . (a.)

Article 3. The “ English ” Company has agreed with the Ottoman Government that the “ English ” Company shall have the option for a period of ten years, tiom the signing * (Note : It is proposed to substitute the formal agreement, as soon as signed, for this document in Annex No. I.)of the definite Concession for the construction of the branch to Sandukly, to extend such branch to Afiun Karahissar, so as to effect a junction with the line of the “ German ” Companies. If the “ English” Company shall not exercise its option the Ottoman Government shall be at liberty to call upon the “ English Company to effect a junction at Afiun Karahissar and, if the “ English ’ Company shall be unwilling to do so, the Ottoman Government shall be at liberty itself to build the line and thereby effect a junction between the lines of the “ English Company and the lines of the “ German ” Companies. It shall be a term of the construction of such line by the Ottoman Government that it will indemnify the “ English ” Company against any loss or diversion of traffic that may be caused to the “ English ’ Company by such junction being made. The “ English ” Company agrees that, if a junction is made, and if the “ German ” Companies desire it to do so, it will co-operate with the “ German ” Companies in obtaining from the Ottoman Government adequate guarantees for the protection of the “ German ” Companies against the diversion of traffic and, so far as may be desired, for a modification or waiver of the “ counter guarantee ” in respect of the line of the “ German ” Companies between Eskishehir and Konia. The “ German ” Companies agree that they will not, at any time, oppose the construction of a line by the “English” Company between Sandukly and Afiun Karahissar and will, if the “ English ” Company shall desire them to do so, co-operate with the “ English ” Company in obtaining from the Ottoman Government adequate guarantees for the protection of the “English” Company against the diversion of traffic. If a junction is made at any time at Afiun Karahissar the “ German ” Companies will enter into an Agreement with the “ English” Company that the rates charged by the “English” Company and the “German” Companies to seaports shall not be competitive and shall from time to time be mutually agreed between the “ English ” Company and the “German” Companies, who will mutually give to one another reasonable traffic and other facilities. Article 4. In the event of the “ English ” Company and the “ German ” Companies being unable at any time to agree as to the rates, &amp;c., to be charged or made by them or either of them from time to time under the terms of article 2 clause 2 and article 3 or as to the nature and extent of the traffic and other facilities to be offered under the terms of article 3 the question in dispute shall be referred to arbitration in manner hereinafter mentioned. Article 5. Any dispute or difference which may arise hereafter concerning the interpretation of these presents or of the formal Agreement to be entered into at an early date in pursuance of these presents or of the rights, duties, and obligations of the “ English ” Company and the “ German ” Companies in connection with the matters above mentioned shall, failing agreement, be referred to the sole decision of an Arbitrator, to be appointed by the parties to such difference. Failing agreement, Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands shall be invited to appoint the Arbitrator. The decision of the Arbitrator shall, notwithstanding any law or custom whatsoever to the contrary, be final and binding upon such parties. Article 6.

[17855] No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. THE following is Article 3, clause (c) of the draft Anglo-German Convention, and section III of the explanatory note attached thereto :— Article 3. Clause (c). His Britannic Majesty’s Govern- ment declare that they will in no case themselves establish, or support any claim by any persons or corporations whatsoever to establish, in Ottoman territory, railway undertakings either in direct competition with the Bagdad Railway Company s lines, or in contradiction with that company s existing rights, unless and until there is complete agreement on the subject between the Impelxal German Government and His Britannic Majesty s Government. For the purposes of this article, the western terminus of the Bagdad Railway system, as defined in the explanatory note attached to the present Convention, shall be held to be at Konia and the eastern terminus at Basra. Section III. In regard to article 3, clause (c), of the Convention, it is agreed to as follows :— 1 . No lines in that part of Asiatic Turkey which, west of the 36th meridian of east longitude, lies south of the 34 th degree of latitude and/or in that part which, east of the said meridian, lies south of the 31st degree of latitude, shall be held to be in direct competition ; but any line north of these limits shall be held to be in direct com petition if it establishes direct railway communication between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. 2. There shall be a protective zone extending for 60 kilom. on either side of the lines of the Bagdad Bailway system, and any line passing within the said zone shall be held to be in direct competition, provided that in the region between Museyib and Kurna the protective zone shall be bounded on the east by a bne drawn midway between the Bivers Tigris and Euphrates, from the latitude of Museyib to Kurna. 3. Local lines serving as feeders for the river navigation and not exceeding 100 kilom. in length shall, provided they do not pass within the protective zone, not be held to be in direct competition. 4 . The question of whether any other line is or is not [2098 y 9 Com to fncrrii ^ ; ♦ . ] MAY 19U iiiiin direct compstition shall, in the event of failure to reach an agreement, be referred to arbitration in accordance with article 10 of the said Convention. A map is annexed for facility of reference. I venture to suggest that the above provisions should be communicated officially to Hakki Pasha, and that his special attention should be drawn to points 1 and 3 of section III of the explanatory note ; that he should be informed that His Majesty's Government are at present opposed to any railway connection with Egypt, but that, in the event of this view being modified at some future date, or of any concessions being granted for railways to the Persian Gulf south of the limits indicated in point I, His Majesty’s Govern ment rely upon the Ottoman Government only granting them to a British group agreeable to His Majesty’s Government, and only allowing the construction under conditions acceptable to them; and that, in view of the fact that His Majesty’s Government have made no small sacrifices in agreeing to article 3, clause (c), in the desire principally to facilitate the negotiations between Germany and Turkey, His Majesty’s Government would much appreciate a written assurance on the subject from the Ottoman Government. I also think Hakki Pasha should be asked to obtain, in favour of the Ottoman River Navigation Company, an option for ten years, to date from the completion of the Bagdad Railway to Basra, for short lines of railway as feeders for the river navigation. His attention might be drawn to the fact that, after the completion of the Bagdad Railway, the River Navigation Company, in which the Ottoman Government are important share holders, will be deprived of much of the lucrative through traffic it will at first enjoy, and will be dependent upon local traffic to a large extent. We might specify a line extending for 100 kilometres on either side of the Tigris, and joining the river at Kut-el-Amara, as one line which will probably be eventually desirable, especially if irrigation work proceeds as rapidly as anticipated.

Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informs me that Herr Helfferich, of the Deutsche Bank, with whom he had a conference this morning, states that the company cannot allow Lake Beyshehir to he regarded as within area to he served hy the Smyrna-Aidin Railway. They consider that it is already a great concession to have allowed that railway to come as far as the north end of Lake Beyshehir. To allow it to come to the town of Beyshehir would he tantamount to giving it the whole of the traffic of the plains of Konia. Besides, it would interfere with their irrigation plans, as the lake drains out to the north of the town of Beyshehir. It might, however, he possible to arrange for common rights of navigation on the lake. Secretary of State informed me that he had telegraphed result of his conference to the German Ambassador for your information. I again pointed out to his Excellency the reasons why you attribute such importance to these concessions, and expressed my regret that refusal of what, com pared to our concessions, was a very moderate request, threatened to render so much work already done useless and perhaps to wreck the whole agreement.

He was extremely anxious that an agreement should he reached ; hut there it was—he had gone through with Herr Helfferich the whole of the arguments produced hy the Smyrna-Aidin Company, and had told him also what I had said, hut Herr Helfferich had said that even the compromise which you had suggested was too detrimental to the interests of the Anatolian Railway Company to make it possible of acceptance.

You should express to German Government the great regret which their failure to meet onr wishes causes me. It was originally claimed by Smyrna-Aidin Company that Lake Beyshehir was within their legitimate area, though the}^ did not claim a monopoly of navigation on the lake, as Herr Helferich seems to have supposed even as late as this week. I cannot agree to confirm the concessions I have offered to the Bagdad Railway against direct competition over their entire system if that company maintains its present attitude, and I have to request your Excellency to make a categorical state- j ment to this effect to the German Government. You should add that I am forced to f this step with the greatest reluctance, and you should add that when the Smyrna- Aidin Company originally asked to come as far as Lake Beyshehir, and to have navigation rights on the lake, they did not anticipate that the Bagdad Railway w T ould build a line as far as Beyshehir town, but that such a line would not go beyond Lake Seidisheir. As a compromise, I am prepared to urge upon the Smyrna-Aidin Company that the meeting point should be half-way down the lake. I shall be much gratified if this point is conceded ; it would be the utmost I could hope to induce the company to agree to; it appears an equitable compromise, and it will afford another opportunity for Anglo-German co-operation in Turkey.

Sir Edivard Grey to Sir L. Mallet. (No. 181.) (Telegraphic.) R. Foreign Office, April 3, 1914. A SERIOUS difficulty has arisen in the negotiations between the Smyrna-Aidin Company and Hakki Pasha. His Highness had repeatedly and strongly urged us to further an uuderstanding between the company and the Italians respecting Buldur-Adalia line, which he was understood to consider desirable both for political and military reasons. In pursuance of his wish company had with great difficulty been induced to agree (notwithstanding the fact that by so doing traffic to the annual value of 10,000k will be diverted from their main line to the port of Adalia) to a junction at Kizil Kaia, provided that they are now promised that, if line is built, they will receive an adequate guarantee (1) in respect of the line from Buldur to Kizil Kaia, and (2) that the net earnings on their main line from Karakouyou to Lake Eghirdir shall not fall below G per cent. Hakki Pasha, who is far less accommodating since Mouktar Bey s arrival, professes to have categorical instructions not to agree to any guarantees whatever (which shows a somewhat invidious distinction against us in view of the unlimited guarantees being given to French and German projects), and will merely agree that Smyrna Company shall be granted terms not less advantageous for Buldur-Kizil Kaia line than Italians may receive for Kizil Kaia—Adalia line. Company cannot accept this, because (&lt;x) their part of proposed line cannot be built without a guarantee except at a loss, and (6) they fear that Italian part of line may be built by means of a secret guarantee from Italian Government or by some other financial subterfuge, possibly in connection with port of Adalia. Company have, however, offered, as alternative to guarantees (1) and (2), to consider the grant of customs_ immunity (which only represents about 10,000k a year) in respect of fuel and material for the whole system, such immunity to become operative from the present date (see Bagdad Railway Convention and Navigation Concession). Meetings have had to be postponed till Monday, and I have to request your Excellency to endeavour to get favourable instructions telegraphed to Hakki Pasha before then. This question and that of pecuniary claims are the only two still outstanding, and I am anxious to conclude all negotiations with Hakki Pasha without further delay.

THE proposals of the British Government of the 31st March last, respecting an Anglo-German Convention, have been under the consideration of the Imperial Government^ who in principle are prepared to accept them in their entirety, but desire certain further modifications as regards their form. 1. In the “ note explicative ” to article 1 (b) of the draft it is desirable that the passage concerning the Imperial Government should run as follows : “ The German Government undertake to the British Government to use their influence with a view to the Deutsche Bank adhering to and carrying out their assurance.” 2. In article 2, last sentence of clause (a), the word ‘‘ declaration ” should be substituted for “convention,” in order to bring the article into harmony with articles 4 and 5 . . , . . i • -i i . 3 At the end of clause (b), article 4, it is proposed that the words m brackets (i e “ not more than 20 per cent, of the whole directorate ”) should be struck out. The inclusion of these words is not necessary as regards the substance of the agreement, and even in point of form it is not quite free from objection, seeing that it differs from the corresponding provision in No. 6 of the agreement between the interested parties of the 27th March, 1914. The German interested parties do not, it is true, desire to obtain more than L 20 per cent, share, but they also do not wish to receive less -a fact Which does not appear to be made clear by the words in brackets. 4. It would be better to strike out No. 2 of clause (c) of article 4 and clause (6) of article 5 The agreements mentioned there are private commercial arrangements, and contain private provisions of a technical and financial nature not intended for publication The Deutsche Bank attach importance to keeping the details of these agreements secret. Should the British Government consider it necessary that the two Governments should take formal note of their contents, and should save mutual assurances for their observance, this could be done by means of a special exchange oi notes which should not be made public—a course the German Government are ready to agree to. N T As reo-ards article 7 (now 8) of the agreement 1 propose to reserve my observations for a later communication, after I have received instructions which have been promised me. -in ± After the proposed alterations of form have been made the Imperial Government will be prepared to initial the agreement forthwith. The initialling of these arrangements can, of course, only be undertaken subject to the reservation that the final signature and ratification will only take place alter the negotiations m piogress between German Government, the Bagdad Railway Company, and the Porte have reached a conclusion which shall take account of German interests. The Imperial Government venture to hope that the British Government will, it necessary, afford them pair diplomatic support for the attainment of this end 1 have, &amp;c.

Goschen to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 30.) (No. 132.) Sir, Berlin, March 27, 1914. I DID not fail to carry out the instructions contained in your telegram No. 79 of the 21st instant with regard to the concessions desired by His Majesty’s Government in return for the undertaking that no railways should be built which would be in direct competition with the Bagdad Railway between Konia and Basra. As I had the honour to inform you by telegram, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that as regards the Mendeli-Kut-el-amara branch line, the Bagdad Railway Company were ready to meet the desire of His Majesty’s Government on the condition that the arrangement should for the moment be kept secret, but that as regards the other concession desired by His Majesty’s Government, namely, that Lake Beyshehir should be included in the area to be served by the Smyrna-Aidin Company, there was no chance of the company accepting your proposal, as they already thought that they had gone quite far enough in meeting the wishes of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company in consenting to their coming to the north-western point of Lake Beyshehir. In discussing the latter point with Herr von Jagow, I pointed out that what was now asked was a very small matter compared to the very large and important concession which His Majesty’s Government had shown themselves disposed to make to the Bagdad Railway. Both Herr von Jagow and Herr von Stumm, who was present at 1 our conversation, showed a disposition to minimise the importance of this concession, and to claim that what we regarded as a great concession was really a right held by them as the original holders of the concession of the Bagdad Railway. I replied that I was of course no expert in the Bagdad Railway question, but that it would surprise me very much to learn that the original concession absolutely excluded the building of any lines which might possibly compete with the Bagdad Railway in any part of the country through which it was to run. I might of course be wrong, but the way in which the company had been straining every nerve to obtain the undertaking not to build competing lines seemed to me to preclude the idea either that it was unimportant or that it was already theirs by right. Herr von Stumm then pointed out that even if this undertaking was a great concession, I must not forget that Germany had made great concessions too, both by giving up their undoubted right of carrying the railway right down to the Persian Gulf, and by allowing two British directors on the board of the Bagdad Railway Company. After some further discussion as to the size and merits of the concessions made on each side, and after 1 had gone fully into the arguments put forward by the Smyrna-Aidin Railway in favour of their claims, with no result, I called Herr von Jatmw’s attention to the fact that you attached great importance to these two concessions, and that you felt that you could not give way upon them without taking- back the concessions that you were prepared to make to German interests. Under these circumstances I hoped that his Excellency would do all in his power to persuade the company to fall in with your views; for he would, I am sure, agree with me in thinking that it would be a thousand pities if the chances of coming to a satisfactory agreement were to be wrecked upon a point which was of minor importance compared to questions which had been already practically settled. Herr von Jagow said that he would go into the matter on the following day with Herr Helfferich of the Deutsche Bank, and let me know the result. His Excellency saw me again after his conversation with Herr Helfferich, and told me that to his great regret the Bagdad Railway Company found it impossible to give way with regard to the inclusion of Lake Beyshehir in the zone of the Smyrna-Aidin Company. After giving me the reasons why the Bagdad Railway Company refused to entertain the compromise which you had suggested—reasons with which you are no doubt familiar—Herr von Jagow said that he also would consider it a great misfortune if this [2067 gg 2] CoDV to 9 APR 1914 hi i IWWIWIWI^., r^= difference of opinion between the two companies should undo the work that had already been done, and endanger the prospects of an agreement. He attached the greatest possible importance to the agreement, both because of the good effect it would have on public opinion in both countries, and because it would exclude the danger of a clash of interests between the only two Powers who were sincere in their desire that the Ottoman Empire should continue to exist. He confessed that he had no confidence in the sincerity of the other Powers in this respect, certainly not in that of Italy or France, and least of all in that of Russia. In any case, he did not give Turkey more than twenty years of existence, and he feared that even that period would be curtailed unless Great Britain and Germany co-operated heartily together. I did not fail to point out to him that the views he had just expressed would seem to render it worth while that a strong effort should be made to persuade the Bagdad Railway Company to give way upon the point which he had been discussing, and upon which you felt so strongly, but his Excellency said that he feared that the company was not to be moved from their decision.

Article 1. The “ English ” Company and the “ German ” Companies shall co-operate to procure that the Ottoman Government shall: 1. Grant to the “ English ” Company a Concession :— (a.) For the construction of a branch line from Karakouyou to Sandukly. (6.) For the construction of a line from some point on the east shore of Lake Eghirdir to a point on the north or north-west coast of Lake Beyshehir, such railway not to extend further in a southerly direction than the latitude of Kazak Adassy. 2. Grant to the group which has undertaken the irrigation of the Plain of Konia a Concession to construct a narrow gauge “local” railway laid, as far as possible, along the navigation dams, connecting the station of Tchoumra on the Bagdad Railway to the shore of Lake Beyshehir at the Town of Beyshehir, such line to be operated by the Bagdad Railway Company. 3. Grant to the “ English ” Company an authorisation for the navigation of Lake Eghirdir and of Lake Beyshehir and to the “ German ” Companies an authorisation for the navigation of Lake Beyshehir. The terms upon which the “ English ” Company and the “ German ” Companies shall be authorised by the Ottoman Government to navigate Lake Beyshehir shall be in all respects identical. It is understood that the authority to navigate Lake Beyshehir shall in no way interfere with any existing rights in connection with the irrigation works deriving their supply of water from Lake Beyshehir. Article 2. It is understood and agreed by and between the “ English ” Company and the “ German ” Companies as follows :— 1. If and whenever the “ English ” Company or the “ German ” Companies shall agree between themselves and with the Ottoman Government that it is desirable for a junction to be made between the line to be constructed by the “English” Company between the Lakes under Article 1 clause 1 (b) and the line to be con structed by the German group under Article 1 clause 2, that such junction shall be made at Munafer on the eastern shore of Lake Beyshehir. Failing agreement between them, neither the “ English” Company nor the “German” Companies shall extend in any direction their respective lines as defined in Article 1 to any other point on Lake Beyshehir. 2. That the “English” Company and the “ German ” Companies will enter into an agreement which shall provide, inter alia : (a.) That the rates charges regulations and facilities made by the “ English ” Company and the “ German ” Companies in respect of the navigation of Lake Beyshehir shall not be competitive and shall be fixed from time to time by agreement between the “ English ” Company and the “ German ” Companies.

Article 3. The “ English ” Company has agreed with the Ottoman Government that the “ English ” Company shall have the option for a period of ten years, from the signing of the definite Concession for the coustruction of the branch to Sandukly, to extend such branch to Afiun Karahissar, so as to effect a junction with the line of the “ German ” Companies. If the “ English” Company shall not exercise its option the Ottoman Government shall be at liberty to call upon the “English” Company to effect a junction at Afiun Karahissar and, if the “ English ” Company shall be unwilling to do so, the Ottoman Government shall be at liberty itself to build the line and thereby effect a junction between the lines of the “English” Company and the lines of the “ German ” Companies. It shall be a term of the construction of such line by the Ottoman Government that it will indemnify the “ English ” Company against any loss or diversion of traffic that may be caused to the “ English ” Company by such junction being made. The “ English ” Company agrees that, if a junction is made, and if the “ German ” Companies desire it to do so, it will co-operate with the “ German ” Companies in obtaining from the Ottoman Government adequate guarantees for the protection of the “ German ” Companies against the diversion of traffic and, so far as may be desired, for a modification or waiver of the “ counter guarantee ” in respect of the line of the “ German ” Companies between Eskishehir and Konia. The “ German ” Companies agree that they will not, at any time, oppose the construction of a line by the “ English ” Compauy between Sandukly and Afiun Karahissar and will, if the “ English ” Company shall desire them to do so, co-operate with the “ English ” Company in obtaining from the Ottoman Government adequate guarantees for the protection of the “English” Companv against the diversion of traffic. If a junction is made at any time at Afiun Karahissar the “ German ” Companies will enter into an Agreement with the “ English” Company that the rates charged by the English Company and the “ German ” Companies to seaports shall not be competitive and shall from time to time be mutually agreed between the “ English ” Company and the German Companies, who will mutually give to one another reasonable traffic and other facilities.

BETWEEN the Bagdad Railway Company—hereinafter referred to as B.R.C.— represented by Geheimer Baurat Dr. Otto Riese of Frankfort-on-the-Main, duly authorised for this purpose, on the one side, and the Right Honourable James Lyle, Baron Inchcape, of London, on the olher side, the following arrangement has been agreed upon : — Article 1. The B.R.C. is at present under agreements with the Societe de Transports Fluviaux en Orient, of Brussels, and with the linn of Lynch Brothers, of London City, concerning the transport of material necessary for the construction of the Bagdad railroad and its branches, on the River Tigris from Basra to Bagdad. It is intended to cancel the said agreements. Conditionally on this cancellation the B.R.C. and Lord Inchcape enter into the following contract with the object of suitably arranging such transport of material for the Bagdad Railway construction on a new basis. Article 2. The B.R.C. agrees to entrust to Lord Inchcape, and the latter agrees to undertake, the transport on the River Tigris from Basra to Bagdad, of all material, machines and articles of any kind (hereinafter collectively called “ goods ”) necessary for the construction and for the working of the Bagdad Railway and its branches, including the port of Bagdad and including further any other construction work to be executed by the B.R.C. or by the firm of Philipp Holzmann and Co. (Limited), of Frankfort-on- Main, as far as the B.R.C. may decide to transport goods to Bagdad by water. The total weight of goods to be transported during the construction of the Bagdad Railway shall not be less than 100,OOu tons of 1,016 kilog. each, but in this guaranteed quantity of 100,000 tons shall be included the total weight o£ all goods already transported or to be transported to Bagdad before the present agreement becomes operative by the Societe de Transports Fluviaux and the tirm of Lynch Brothers by order and for account of the B.R.C., amounting, on the 1st Februarv, 1914, to about 10,000 tons. Article 3. Lord Inchcape agrees to transport from Basra to Bagdad, on craft provided by himself, all quantities of goods delivered to him by the B.R.C. up to a maximum of 3,500 tons of 1,016 kilog. each per month, and the B.R.C , on the other hand, agrees to provide not less than 2,500 tons of 1,016 kilog. each of goods per month until the said 100,000 tons has been entrusted to Lord Inchcape for such transport as aforesaid. The B.R.C. agrees to advise the representative of Lord Inchcape at Basra or Bagdad of the quantity to be shipped during any given month, two months in advance. On special desire of Lord Inchcape such information shall be given four months in advance, but shall then be considered as an estimate only, and not as binding the B.R C. Quantities up to 500 tons per month beyond the quantities for the delivery of which the B.R.C. may have engaged itself, shall be transported without previous advice, but Lord Inchcape reserves to himself the right to allow or not to allow the maximum monthly quantity of 3,500 tons to be exceeded. The B R.C. undertakes to make the necessary arrangements for the timely delivery at Basra of the quantities of goods as advised by it. Should any of the craft employed by Lord Inchcape for the transport of goods be detained at Basra or at Bagdad for more than four consecutive days by reason of goods not being provided by the B.R.C., or of any delay, neglect, failure, or default in the loading or discharging thereof, the B.R.C. shall pay Lord Inchcape by way of demurrage 41. for the fifth and each following day for each steamer, and 11. for the fifth and each following day for each barge. Claims for demurrage must be presented to the representative of the B R.C. in time to allow an examination of the respective claim. If the representatives of the parties to this contract disagree about the claim, the final decision thereon shall rest at Basra with the British consul, at Bagdad with' the German consul. ; To the extent to which Lord Inchcape may find it convenient to employ the steamers and barges in other work, demurrage shall be reduced or not charged.12 The goods loaded into the barges shall, as far as possible, be taken under had seal. Lord Inchcape agrees to issue orders to his stall to help and assist as much as possible the employes of the B.R.C. in statipg the losses and tiling the claims 'with the insurance companies. Article 4. r V ‘ 11 The goods arriving at Basra by sea steamer and delivered by the latter ‘‘from the ships slings” (“sous palan ”) will be directly loaded into and properly stored away in the barges by the B.R.C., but the B.R.C. has the right at any time to take part of the goods to its magazine at Basra, whence they will be loaded by the B.R.C. into the barges. Lord Inchcape undertakes (accidents excepted) to provide not less than five steamers and eighteen barges for service under this contract and to make every effort to place barges alongside the sea steamers, so that their discharge may be made into these barges with a view to avoid the necessity for landing goods at Basra. The B.R.C. undertakes to arrange that the stevedoring of the goods in the barges will be properly done, and that the instructions of the skippers of the river craft will be complied with. Any costs which should result from the non-observation of this engagement will have to’ be defrayed by the B.R.C. The barges arriving at Bagdad will be discharged by the B.R.C. alongside the landing place installed for that purpose. The representative of the B.R.C. has to decide the order in which the loaded barges are to be despatched from Basra to Bagdad. The bills of lading for the river service will have to be issued and handled in a similar way to that hitherto arranged with Messrs. Lynch Brothers. ft Article 5. The B.R.C. pays to Lord.Inphcape for each ton of 1,016 kilog. loaded at Basra the general rate of 22^ (twenty-two and one half) shillings. This rate will also apply upon all goods shipped and to be shipped from Basra to Bagdad under the agreement referred to in article 1 hereof, by the Societe de Transports Lluviaux en Orient and Messrs. Lynch Brothers, up to the time the present contract becomes operative. The freight is to be calculated upon the weight stated in the bill of lading of sea steamer. Should this method not be applicable—which may happen in a few instances when goods are taken into the barges from the magazine—the weight shall be fixed at Basra by a representative of the B.R.C. and a representative of Lord Inchcape. The representative of Lord Inchcape shall present not later than the 5th of each month a statement showing the shipments made during the preceding month. The B.R.C., after examination of the statement, but not later than the 15th of each month, shall make payment for tiie said shipments in London. Specifications of all the shipments made by the B.R.C. to Basra shall be rendered regularly by the B.R.C. to Lord Inchcape at his London office. Article 6. Lord Inchcape will keep a special account for the steamers and barges engaged in the transport of the goods, crediting to same all receipts and debiting it with all expenses resulting from them, including a depreciation of 18f per cent, per annum, on the original cost of the craft purchased for the carrying of the goods, the charge for depreciation to cease when the craft has been written down to 25 per cent, of its original cost. If in any calendar year the special account shows a profit of more than 10 per cent, on the capital used for the purchase of all the necessary vessels actually in service, and accessories, the surplus shall be equally divided between Lord Inchcape and the B.R.C. If Lord Inchcape desires to employ the steamers and/or barges for the transport of goods other than those comprised in this contract, no objection will be raised, provided that the transport of the Bagdad Railway material will in no way be interfered with. The receipts resulting from such other transports shall not be credited to the Special Account, whilst vice versa any expenses resulting from those other transports lover and above those which would have been incurred had no such other cargo been carried) shall not be debited to the Special Account. “* 'XArticle 7. The B.R.C. heretofore, has been compelled to enter into agreements with third parties for auxiliary transports to Bagdad, amounting to 3,000 tons for the year 1913 ^ and 7,200 tons for the current year. The B.R.C. undertakes not to give any further goods for transport to any other owners of sailing vessels or other craft, provided however that, if Lord Inchcape should in three consecutive months—transport less than his obligation under article 3 of this contract, the B.R.C. shall have the right to the extent of such deficiency to enter into contracts for shipments on sailing vessels, the amount so shipped to be deducted from the guaranteed minimum of 100,000 tons. Should Lord Inchcape fail to provide transport for 75 per cent, of the goods tendered for transport according to article 3 hereof, in each of three consecutive months, then, unless that shall be due to any of the causes specified in articles 9 and 10 hereof, he shall refund to the B.R.C. 3 shillings for each ton so tendered and not carried during such period. Should Lord Inchcape fail to provide transport in each of six consecutive months for 50 per cent, of the goods tendered for shipment according to article 3, then, unless that shall be due to any of the causes specified in articles 9 and 10 hereof, the B.R.C. shall have the right to cancel the present contract without any compensation, and to exercise, in its discretion, in any other manner the right granted to it by article 9 of the Bagdad Convention of the 5th March, 1903.
