The supply of such material was seen by the British Government as a means of influencing certain minor powers in the Middle East in favour of the British on the outbreak of war [the Second World War, 1939-45]. Supplying the material was viewed as being easier for the Government of India than HM Government in the United Kingdom.The file contains correspondence from the Government of India External Affairs Department, and the Government of India Department of Supply.The papers show that the Government of India were prepared to supply Iran with 102,000 tons of rails with accessories.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Department of Supply</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>War (concept)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Railway lines</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001d4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
