Dated ? Simla, the 21st September 1929. Memorandum . Subject:- Rejection of materials by consignees and procedure regarding disposal. Cases have occurred recently which make it necessary to explain to Indenting Officers that rejected stores, from the moment of their rejec tion, become the property of the contractors and should^e held pending specific instructions either from the suppliers or from the Indian Stores Department as to disposal. Failure to observe the lav/ on this point will probably result in Indenting Officers having to bear the cost 01 handling and transport charges incurred in despatching the rejected material to any destination without express authority from the suppliers. In many instances the most economical means of disposal of such material is to sell at site, because the cost of returning the goods to the suppliers' station is very heavy and may exceed the value of the stores. 2. It must, moreover, be realized that as the Indian Stores Depart ment is the contracting party, the final rejection of. stores lies only within its competence. When, therefore, Indenting Officers consider that grounds for rejection of stores exist, a full report should be forwarded to the Indian Stores Department and the goods complained of should be stored pending investigation. //~1- 7 ( t ‘-- ^ - r ~7 Chief Controller of Stores. - - - • ' ] w . f ~Y: ^ ; - RECEIPT, ISSUE AMD E XPENSE VOUCHER.

On receipt of intimation from the Shipping Company of discharge of stores, the Consignee or his Representative should repair to the Transit Shed and examine the outward condition of all packages, and if any are found to be in a defective or doubtful condition he should apply within 7 days of discharge of goods, to the Owners or Agents of the vessel concerned, or to their accredited Surveyors for a survey on the goods landed in a defective or doubtful condition. Goods landed in a defective or doubtful condition should not be removed from the Transit Shed until a survey has been held. 2. Each defective or doubtful package should be inspected and opened by the Shipping Company’s Surveyor in the presence of the Consignee, or his Representative, and the Port Trust Representative, and the extent of the shortage or damage established. Recoveries for shortages or damages being effected in the usual manner from the Owners or Agents of the ship concerned if the survey determined that the damages or deficiencies occurred while the stores were in the custody of the ship, or from the Port Trust if the survey determined that such loss occurred while the stores were in their custody. The columns marked with an asterisk should be filled in by the Surveyor only in the event of goods being landed in a damaged or doubtful condition, the Con signee making the necessary entries in the columns concerned otherwise. The decision arrived at by the Survey Committee as to extent and liability of damages and deficiencies should be incorporated in the endorsement— or receipt granted to the ship. All claims for any loss by reason of any damage to stores or of any deficiency in the quantity delivered, not covered by the printed exceptions of the B/L and as determined by the Surveyor should be preferred, against the Owners or Agents, as the case maybe, of the vessel, through the Shipper within one month of the date of arrival of the vessel. The Agents of the vessel at port of discharge being acquainted at the same time of such action. 3. All articles not enclosed in packages are held to have been counted or weighed by the Master of the vessel on shipment, and consequently any loss is chargeable to the Owner. 4. Should any articles appear to have original defects, samples upon which a judgment may be formed should in all cases be returned with the complaint, whether it relates to quality or pattern. 5.

Sir Uniform of Punjabi Police I have the honour to inform you that it has been decided that it is necessary for the above force to wear a slightly different uniform to that worn by them now. Please carry out the following changes as soon asyou can arrange for them to be made. It is particularly desired that the changes should bo made with as little delay as possible. i. The red 'Flares' worn on the side of the puggaries are no longer to be worn. ii. Puggaries are to be worn with the ends loose. iii. Shorts to be replaced by loose Ehakhi baggy trousers like those worn by the men in walking out dress. The object of these changes, as you are aware, is to lessen the resemblance of the Punjabi Police to an Indian Army unit. it is unsuitable that thej should resemble the Indian Army so closely, that strangers arriving in Bahrain might ouite reasonably suppose them to be a detatchment of British troops. ihis alteration wij .1 entail considerable expenses©. Part of this&lt;^ might be covered by the sale of some oi the shorts which will not now be needed. Please find out wheth r suitable material can be obtained locally and for what cost the trousers can be contracted for. I should prefer to patronise local people.&gt;7 l ^n.'* it would be advisable to inform the fo’ CG that the reason for this change is m' ry to distinguish them in appearance from regulcI nGiau Army troops, as Bahrain is an irab ; a te and we do not wish to give the appear ance its being ’’occupied 1 ’ by British Indian troor w kich ^i-ht easily be supposed by persons una c&lt;ainted with the place and local conoitions. 1 ha\ r e the honour to be, 3ir, Your Obedient Servant Advieer to the Government, Bahrain O'.-The Political Agency* Bahrein.
