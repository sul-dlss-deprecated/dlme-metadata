Stevim^on c 166, ffrocBuych Street, London, K.C.3. !84th January, 1946 Sir, Yt&gt;e I-B «ri .l BfirtV of Xrcn e are desired by tiu Directore of Toe Imperial Bank of Iiwn to aubrait tbc enclotseu draft of a bu ple^ental Charter for the approval of the Lords Commleeioners of His Ma^etty*e Treasury. It will be recalled that the Bank wae established by a Royal Charter dated 2no September 1889, under the style of the Impenial B^nk of Persi a, to act as a State Bank in Persia and to exerciae certain other functionajjnder a conceeaion granted by the Shah to the founders of the Bank, j The term of the Original Charter was 30 years hut this term has been twice extended by Supplemental Charters with the result that the Charter is now eo-terminous with the Concession which is due to expire on 30th January 1949. At the request of the Government of Iran the Bank in 193b obtained a Supplemental Charter authorising it to esBuine its present name* By a Supplemental Charter dated 24th July 1^28 the Bank wss authorised to establish branch banks in The Kmpine of India and Iraq. The exercise of this right was in the case of India made subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for India in Council, and in the case of Iraq subject to the concent of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Government of Iraq. ♦ In pursuance of these powers the Bank has established branches at Baghdad and Basra. /ItIt should also be mentioned that the Bank with the coneent of the Government of India haa established during t the present war branches at Bahrain and Kuwait although those places are not strictly within the limits of the Indian Empire* The present issued capital of the Bank is £1,000&gt;000 divided into 100,000 shares of £10 each, all of which are fully paid up* In this connection attention is directed to clause 143(1) of the Bank’s Deed of Settlement. A copy of the last Directors* Report and Accounts is sent herewith for the information of their Lordships. As regards the Concession, the position how is that since the surrender to the Iranian Government in 1930 of the exclusive right granted by the Concession of issuing notes, the only substantial privilege subsisting under the Concession is exemption from Iranian taxation. I. Whether or not the Government of Iran would be prepared to renew the Concession or grant a new concession is a matter for conjecture, but it is thought that in any event it is unlikely that the total exemption from taxation would be renewed. In the opinion of the Directors it would be inadvisable, having regard to the present political situation, to make any approach to the Iranian Government for a renewal of the Concession, and in any case the Directors know of nothing that would prevent the Bank from continuing to carry on business in Iran, notwithstanding the expiry of the Concession, provided the term of the Charter is extended. Indeed it me 5 ell be that as a matter of policy the Directors would not consider it to be in the interests of the Bank to apply for any formal concession. The Directors, however, consider that it is most important in connection with their position vie a vie the Iranian Government that the term of the Bank* s Charter should be extended well in advance of the date of the expiry of the Concession. In the above circumstances the Directors request that their Lordships should approve of the extension of the term/ &lt;9 of the Bank* 8 Char ter for a period of 50 yeere. In putting forward thir request the TUrectore respectfully desire to emphaaiee the satisfactory condition of the Bank* a affairs in Iran and to urge that its continued rxietence would he to the manifest advantage^ of British court!ercia! interest in the Middle ' ast* The enclosed draft ? upplemental'Charter alro provides for the following: 1 * i ower to establish branch honks in the l iddle Fast Countries other than Turkey, and in the Arabian eninsula, /byesinid and the coastal territories of t Kast A tries Irom the* borders oi the £udan down to the northern boundary of Portuguese Tr ast Africa, the exercise of such power to be subject in the eefee of British territories to the consent of the f&lt; cretary of ! tate concerned end in the case of foreign territories Subject to the c neent of the Government thereof. 2* Power to carry on the buFinest of an executor an i trustee company and to act as secretary, manager, liquidator, receiver and registrar and generally f?c a * trust o -r ornt on. 3 . Power to carry on business at its Head “flee in London v itliout being restricted to such ope at ions only as being ’com eneed in the territories where the Bank ie permitted to operate have' to be continued &lt; leewnere or being comnu need in England have to be continued in such territories. 4 « : ower to acquire lands and buildings for the purposes of the London Office of a total snnusl value of 10,000 per annum# b. For an exprent declaration that the Bank has power to acquire premises outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of its business and for providing Bcconuaodption and amenities for itfc employees. With regard to (1) shove the Directors feel satisfied that there is scope for the activities of the /BankBank in the additional territories. The considerations underlying the desired power to establish branches in ^byssinif and rast Africa are the possible scope for banking services which may arise by reason of the existing caiumercial links between Abyssinia and the ast Af: lean coastal territories and the countries of the Middle hast, where the bank is al!eady - ^^. aiown and established. As regards (2) above, modern conditions make it desirable that the oanx should be able to meet th&lt; convenience of its customers by being in a position to act as an executcr and trustee and in similar capacities. As regards (3J above, it will be appreciated that the desired extension of the bank *8 powers would not extend furthez than to enable the Bank to function normally as a Bank at its main office in the Uni ed Kingdom. The pres* nt restriction the the financial operations must be operations which have commence within th; territories within the scope of the Charter but have ; to be continued elsewhere or being coiamenced elsewhere have to be continued in such territojies is somewhat artificial, and might well in certain circumstances impede the Bank in carrying out normal banking functions pertinent to its business. The fourth new power referred to above, it is submitted, is desii‘able by reason of the increase in land values which has taken place since the foundation of the bank. It is also thought that it is desirable to make it clear that the B^nk has power* to acquire additional premises for the purpose of its London Office. As regards the fifth matter, experience has shewn that in r dealing with Oriental Governments, the express d da rat ion of the oa ik’s power to hold land abroad is very necessary. We shall be grateful if you would kindly let us know on behalf of our clients whether their Lordships would be prepared fo: mally to approve the draft supplemental Charter so soon as such draft has been approved by a Special absolution of the shareholders of the Bank. »*e are, dir, four obedient Servants* The Secretary, Treasury, Great George Street, (Sgd.)

Whatever legal phraseology might be introduced into letters exchanged with the Persian Sovernment, with the object of retaining thoee rights, our view is that once we had agreed that Commercial Instruments emanating, from the B ink. should he stamped at the time of issue, it would not he practicable at a later date- to revert to the statue quo. Surely one effect of a Concession is to place the ConoeeBionalre in a position of sa ariorlty over others. That the national Bank would claim elmilar privileges to The Imperial Banic has not weighed with ue in arriving at our decision, indeed, it has no bearing upon it. It might .vail be, seeing they .re a Oovernmant Institution and that the Stamp Duty would paM one e-overniaent rocket to another, that without our immunity from each duties they might be able to offer bettor torma to customers than ourselves. Even sere the customer to bear the cost of the Stamp, we should lose the half per aille superiority in value which drafts sold by us should command over thelre.We raise no objection to the Stamp Duty on Cheque forme supplied by ue to customers, provided it ie paid by the customs, but the Board do not agree that the Stamp Duty can be 3 evi#d at any ti’se during their currency on Bilie and Jotmnercial emanating from the Chief Office, or any Branch of th# Banlc, as this would infringe the Concession. fha Counsel consulted harbours no doubts as to the true meaning of article B paragraph 3, as you will see from his reply to the various questions submitted for advice. From this you will gather that In hie opinion the following documents emanating from the B&amp;nJt are, under the Bank's Concession, immune from Stemp Tax at the time of their issuance and through out their existence. In other words, that neither the Bank at the time of issue, nor the purchaser, nor the holder at any time, nor the party presenting for ayment, is liable to affix stamps upon the instrument. O? SEaM? T, .S: 1) Cheques, Drafts, Bills, demand or at usance, issued by one Branch of the Bank upon another Branch, whether (a) issued by a Branch in J?eraia u on another in lereia (b) issued by a Branch in yeraia upon one outside the country. (o) issued by a Branch outside Persia upon a Branch in Persia 2) Cheques, jrafts. Bills, demand or at ueanee, issued by a Branch in Persia upon a Correspondent either in or outside Persia. 3) Cheques drawn by the Bank u»on its Cashier's Department, or upon another Bank. LIaBLju Tu The following documents are liable to Stamp Tax andtho Bank ic precluded from talcing euch unleae they hear the Tax:- 1) Bills or Cheques drawn hy others which the Bank negotiates or accepts for Collection, whether drawn within the country and payable within, or pj-yable abroad, or drawn abroad and payable within* (such Stamp must be affixed by the drawer, or customer, before negotiation or acceptance for Collection)* Z) iromissory Notee drawn by customers and discounted or accepted for Collection by the Bank* 2) Cheques drawn by customers u,on their current accounts with the Bank* The Bank is froed from any obligation to stamp Cheque forms, even at customers* expense, before issue to a customer, but before paying such cheques it must see that they are stamped* As the Act Imposes no Stamp Duty on Beceipts, there was no question on this point to place before Counsel* Were, however, such to be imposed later, the coarse to be followed is that no Beceipt which has to be signed by the Bank requires such Stamp. I may add that, to avoid any misunderstanding we submitted to our Lawyers our rendering, as quoted above, of the effect of Counsel’s advice, and they confirm its accuracy* We telegraphed you at length on the subject on the lath instant and simultaneously wrote to Sir Lancelot Oliphant of the Foreign Office, acquainting him with recent telegrams exchanged with you and of Oounael’s Opinion* The Board are desirous( 5 1241/847/34) 17th ^ar^h, 1931, rv Dear Mr* :idriA f ie have now oonaiaered /om* letter of the 11th Maroh regarding the Per a lan iitaag) Aet* ?he position aee»te to he that the Freneh lQP:al adviser in f^hran has given the Persian Povernffient a daiinite opinion regal'd!ng the interpretation of the effeot of one of the olanses in your soneeaeion, and that your legal advisers in London have given you an opinion in precisely the opposite sense# yrom a legal point of vie the noriml oourse would now be for the legal question to ha settled by arbitration in aaoorda *3© with Article 3 of Appendix 5 of the lonaeseian as signed on the 13th Pay, 1930* »e note, however, that this is not the course reooTnmanded either by your head office at Tehran or by the British L get ion# *e feel that great wei^t must be aa orded to the views of our reepeotive looal representatives, who are In a battor position than we are to gauge the situation# Lo doubt their agreed opinion derives from the paramount importanoe whloh they attaoh to the m^inteaanse of the roost cordial relations between the Baiu- and the rersiaa lovernroent and the necessity for the Beak to do all that is possible to prove to the Persian ^overnroent its V willingness to help during the present eoanomio crisis# As/ j£«M#£l&amp;rid, :eq •A« /Ott imow, thdtr« Is in f'ereia always a sns pi 3 ion ~ no miter how onjastified - that the Bank has at heart the interests of its shareholders rather than Persia’s interest a, and in the light of the events of the past two years it is clearly of great im ortanoe to endeavour to gain the complete son£1 dense of the Persian Jovemment* ’urther your Board will no douht aaneider the final paragraph of Mr^Uthwatt’s opinion of the 5th February, if the issue on the present Persian law were submitted to arbitration and the jonk were auaeaseful, the ertian overnraent oould apparently by amending the law and rendering the oustoroer and not the Bank liable fbr the tax produce very nearly the same praatiaal result without infringing the eonoeesion. These then are the main eonel&amp;erations whioh we think should influence the Board in reabhing a decision on the guestioa now at issue.

BASK OF PBRSIA, ) 3/36, King William Street, London, i .C.4. 28th fcareh, 1924. V &amp; Sir, I have the honour to invite your attention to the correspondence ending with Sir John Bradbury's letter Lo.19432/ ^u v o** the 8th August 1919 regarding the renewal of the Charter of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and to point out that the period of five years for which the Charter was renewed in 1919 will expire on the 2nd September next. 2. In my letter of the 14th January 1919 the petition of the Bank was that the Charter might be renewed for a term of 30 years from the 2nd day of September 1919, so as to coincide with the unejroired period of the Concession granted to the Bank by the Shah of Persia. In Sir John Bradbury's reply the reason given for restricting the renewal to a period of five years only was that it was not possible at that time to foresee what conditions the development of the resources of Persia might make it necessary or desirable to laydown in * \ future in connection with the extension of the Charter for a longer period. .In the interval which has since elapsed affairs in that pountry have settled down into a condition not very different from that which existed before the war. Also, by the Supplemental Charter of 24th July 1922, the Bank has been permitted lo open Branches in Irak and British India, and so far as the Board of directors is able to judge, no fresh conditions affecting the Bank's position seem to be required. 3. In the circumstances I have the honour, on behalf of the Imperial Bank of Persia to present to the Lords Commissioners of His lajesty’s Treasury, the Bank's humble petition The Secretary, The Treasury, Whitehall, S. .1.*»s petition praying that their Royal Charter may now be renewed from the 2nd September 1924 to the 30th January 1949, the date on which their Concession from the Government of Persia comes to an end. 4. It is hardly necessary to remind Their lordships of the great importance of t e position held by the Imperial Bank of Persia as regards trade in and commerce with that country, oj of its value, as a British institution occupying the position of the State Bank of Persia, in upholding British influence and prestige, and 1 think it must be obvious that any reluctance on the part of the British Government to extend the Charter to the full period of the Bank’s bonceasion must tend to affect the Bank’s reputation in Persia, and therefore its power of usefulness to the Home Government.

Should His Majesty’s Govern ment consider that there is ?any objection to alteration of wording of charter from Persia and not elsewhere ?to Persia and elsewhere I suggest that intimation of their acquiescence should be accompanied by reservation that it must be understood that in the absence of specific recognition oy Iraq Government modification of the Banks charter will not involve the enjoyment of any status or privileges in Iraq wnich they did not at present possess.

According to the Charter of the Company originally granted in 1889, under Clause 2 we are restricted to carrying on the business of the Banh through Branches throughout Persia, and where necessary through Agents elsewhere, but at the same time our Agents in other countries are confined to business they do on behalf of the Bank to such financial operations as being commenced in Persia have to be co itinued elsewhere, or being commenced elsewhere have to be continue' in Persia* By the Banh’s concession granted in January 1889, under Cla se 1, liberty is given to the Bank to domicile itself at Teheran and establish Branches in other towns in Persia and abroad. 5*or some years oast the activities of the Bank have been handicapped by reason of the Charter not being sufficiently elastic to give full play to the scope of the Bank’s operations through Agencies, and it is the urgent desire of the Board that Pis majesty’s Government will give authority to extend the powers of the Charter and bring it into line with present day requirevents. Especially during the war tl e want of wider powers has been keenly felt, and we have found it imperative, in order to allow us to fully cope with the requirements of the Government during the war, to open Agencies in Bombay, 3 sra and Bagdad* Through the instrumentality of these Agencies we were able to supply more or less entirely the large financial requirements of His Majesty’s Government in Persia. BasraBasra and Bagdad Agencies, establisiied in war time, have rlready demonstrated their value in financing the trade s.nd commerce of Persia via Ilesopotamia, it “being through Bagdad that the greater proportion of the Persian imports are distributed, and Persia has also benefited very greatly by the establishment of an Agency of the Bank at Bombay• The Board are of opinion that the widening of the Charter sufficiently to permit of the Bank converting these Agencies into Branches - which widening would only bring the Charter into line with the Concession - would be of great value to Persian trade and its relations with the United Kingdom, Indie and Mesopotamia# The great political changes that have occurred in the last mentioned place during the past few years have already had a marked effect in promoting greater freedom and elas ticity of trade between Irak and Persia, and the limits then set to the Bank's operations at the time the Charter was granted could not have' been foreseen and are, it is contended, out of date and unnecessary at the present time. It is needful to emphasise that when a Native Government is established in Mesopotamia it will depend largely for its revenue on the commercial prosperity of the country and as Bagdad is the avenue through which an increasing proportion of Persia’s trade passes both with this country and India, it is essential that Persia’s Bank should be established both in Mesopotamia and India, and with its scope unrestricted. Although the trade of Persia with its bordering countries has enormously increased since 1889, no change in thethe statue of the Bank has Been mde to correspond v/ith it. It is claimed that duri ig the past thirty years and more the Bank has been mainly instrumental in the fostering of enterprise and Persian trade with the surrounding countries, and also that with more freedom of action any By widening the terms of the Bank’s Charter, a still further impetus may Be looked for. Ho restrictions of a similar nature to those governing the Bank’s affairs are imposed upon our competitors, who are already establishing themselves in Persia and taking advantage of the work we have done to make the country attractive to financial enterprises, and we feel keenly that we are not able fully to expand in a like manner in Mesopotamia, India and elsewhere. lie therefore appeal to Their lordships to permit * an alteration to Be made in the second Clause of the Charter from its present wording, and for ready reference we attach a copy of the original Clause, the new Clause setting forth the change prayed for, and copy of the Clause of the Concession permitting us to open Branches outside Persia.Clause 2 ox the Bank^ Quarter as at ^resent.

Dear Niemeyer:- With reference to your letter of the 11th instant about the charter of the Imperial Bank of Persia, I have consulted the Department concerned and find that some time ago after the matter had been submitted to Lord Curzon we told you that we saw no reason why the Bank's charter should on its renewal be limited to any shorter period than in the original document. With regard to your suggestion to limit it, say to a period of five years, our view is that such a pronounce ment to the Bank might have a somewhat serious result as such action might have an unsteadying effect on the Imperial Bank itself and such other big British commercial enter prises as are at present engaged in commerce with Persia, on the ground that His Majesty's Government appeared to intend to disinterest themselves in Persia within the period of five years. Apart from the actual question of commission to which you refer, the Imperial Bank have always appeared to us to v/ork exceedingly well with the Legation and ourselves and it would be decidedly unfortunate if without very strong reasons they were now given grounds for supposing that we viev/ed them less favourably than hitherto. We should, therefore, prefer to adhere to the view expressed in our official letter. Yours &amp;c., (Signed) J.A.C. Tilley. O.E. Niemeyer Esq., Treasury..7 .

The shorter period might also make the Bank rather more amenable on the question of commission. further extension for thirty years. Y/e are doubtful about so long an extension as the Bank, which have a practical Incidentally this short period might help your Yours sincerely, P.

To The Right Hon’ble LORD GEORGE F. HAMILTON, G.C.S.I., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 20th August 1903. My Lord, We have the honour to invite Your Lordship’s attention to a recent No. 38 (Secret), Gated the 29th March 1903 (to His despatch, from the Minister at leliran, Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs). expressing his apprehensions aS to the future of the Imperial Bank of Persia. As to the importance of this institution to British interests, we are in complete accord with Sir Arthur Hardinge. By the terms of the two Russian loan agreements of 1900 and 1902, the Persian Government consider that they are debarred from raising any foreign loan without the previous consent of the Russian Government; and the Grand Vizier’s reply to an offer of financial assistance made by His Majesty’s Govern ment in 1901 afforded an illustration of the effect of this restriction. Recently we have ascertained by practical experiment that the Persian Government are prepared to hold that loans from the Imperial Bank are not inconsistent with their obligations to Russia, and they have increased the value of the precedent by declining to permit the Russian Government to intervene and pay off the advance. Apart, therefore, from general questions of commercial utility or political prestige, the Bank has a special value to us, as the sole prac ticable medium hitherto found of financing Persia with British or Indian funds. Whether we actually make further loans or not, it is very undesirable that Persia should be left in a situation in which she could only hope to obtain money from Russia, and at the price of such political concessions as that Government might demand. 2. For the 13 years during which the Bank has been in existence, it appears, from the figures which are given in the memorandum attached to Sir Arthur Hardinge’s despatch, to have made profits amounting on an average throughout the period to over 7 per cent on a capital of £650,000, and the profits of 1902 were larger than in any previous year since 1890. Hitherto, therefore, the institution has suffered no material damage from the rivalry of the Banque d’Escompte, and, though there is some risk, we do not fully share the Minister’s apprehensions for the future of the Bank on this score. What appears to us to be the greater risk is that the Russian Government may endeavour to obtain control of an institution which she cannot ruin by com petition. In your telegram of the 4th July 1903, Your Lordship informed us, in reply to our enquiries, that though, subject to the provisions of the Charter, the Regulations might be altered by a Resolution supported by a three-fourths share of the capital, neither the disposal of the Charter nor a change in the constitution of the Bank is possible. We are still, however, apprehensive lest i &gt; /2 the Russian Government, by purchasing a majority of the shares, may obtain a practical control over the operations of the Bank, despite the majority of British Directors, which, we understand, is required by the terms of the Charter. Sir Arthur Hardinge has recommended that, to avert this danger, the British Government should itself acquire a sufficient interest in the Bank to ensure the preservation of its present character. To effect this, it would he necessary to buy more than half the shares, and we are unwilling to recommend such a measure. We consider, however, the risk which we have mentioned to be so real that it would he worth while to make enquiries as to the manner in which the shares are now held, and as to the possibility of any considerable purchase being made on Russian behalf without our receiving due warning in time to intervene. We understand that Sir James Mackay has recently joined the Board of Directors of the Bank, and we would suggest that he might be approached on the subject. 3 . We take this opportunity of asking Your Lordship to obtain for us a copy of the Charter of the Bank, of the Deed of Settlement which we understand to have been made thereunder, and of the Regulations referred to in Your Lordship’s telegram of the 4th July. * We have the honour to he, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants,1903.

The metallic reserve to the extent of two-thirds thereof maybe in bullion. The difference between this metallic reserve and the amount of the notes in circulation shall not at any one time be more than the amount of the paid-up capital. Art. 5. The Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah will name an Imperial High Commissary to exercise its high supervision over the bank. The High Com missary’s functions shall be as follows : He shall have the right to attend the general meetings of the bank and also to attend any periodical meetings of the management at Tehran.

Art. 6 . The bank shall not be required to make any advances to the Imperial Government beyond the stipulated 40,000/. without having approved securities for such further advances.

Questions arising between the bank and private persons in the provinces may, by consent of both parties, be decided by a local Umpire to be appointed by the Consul or Consular representative of any of the above-named Powers.

The Imperial Government undertakes to immediately put into execution such decisions as may be arrived at either by the agreement of Arbitrators or the determination of the final Umpire. Art. 9.

[Saturday, July 13.] Section 1. 1127 No. 1. Treasury to Foreign Office.—(Received July 13.) Sir, Treasury Chambers, July 13, 1889. I HAVE submitted to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury the various letters received from your Department on the subject of the proposed estab lishment of a State Bank in Persia for which Baron Julius de Beuter has obtained a Concession from His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia; and I have drawn their Lordships’ special attention to the letter written by Lord Salisbury’s direction on the 2nd instant, in which he strongly urges, on political grounds, that a Boyal Charter should be granted to the promoters of the undertaking, in order that the question as to unlimited liability in respect of notes attaching to a bank which is formed under the Companies’ Acts, and which issues notes outside the United Kingdom, may be avoided. . . My Lords, as you are aware, felt that they would not be justified in entertaining the application under any circumstances so long as the Concession retained the form in which it was originally granted. This view having been notified to the promoters, they undertook to endeavour to secure an alteration of the terms of the Concession in ^ those^ respects in which exception was principally taken to it by this Board, and in which they themselves acknowledge the Concession to be defective. They now submit, through the Foreign Office, certain Articles for embodiment as additions to the Concession. Though these Articles are calculated materially to improve the terms of the original Concession, it will, as modified by those Articles only, still contain provisions to which it would be impossible to give the imprimatur of a Boyal Charter. If, in deference to Lord Salisbury’s urgent representations, my Lords consent to advise the grant of a Boyal Charter to the Imperial Bank of Persia, which privilege they have consistently declined to grant to any Banking Company for more than a quarter of a century, they are specially bound to see that the bank is constituted on sound principles; otherwise they themselves would not only be making themselves parties to a grant which, owing to its being itself so exceptional, and owing to its being so exceptionally bestowed, had misled subscribers, but also of having given their sanction to the constitution of a bank on a basis not calculated to secure reasonable safety. # My Lords feel sure that Lord Salisbury will admit the weight of these considera tions, and from the observations which they are about to make, his Lordship will see that my Lords feel bound to press for further modifications in the Concession before they can consent to advise the issue of a Boyal Charter. * 1 . Under the Concession, as amended by the Articles, the bank would still have Article A. power to establish branches outside Persia; indeed, anywhere. Accordingly, under the plea of rendering financial assistance to the Shah’s Government, and developing the resources of Persia, a Company might secure the exceptional privilege of a Charter, while it might establish itself and carry on business in any other part of the world. The bank should only be allowed to establish itself anywhere in Persia, but not elsewhere. . 2. My Lords confess that they do not follow the meaning of certain words m Article B. Article B, according to which the bank would not be empowered, without the consent of the Persian Government, to “ discount or make advances on Government bills not drawn on the bank.” 3. The antecedent condition to the commencement of business ought to be the Article C, payment in full, not only the subscription, of a prescribed amount of capital ( 1 , 000 , 000 /.). , 1 . . 4. My Lords take note that, according to Article C as worded, the subscription Ibid, of the capital or greater part of it in this country would be a necessary preliminary to the grant of a Boyal Charter. 5. The Board presumes that nominative shares mean shares payable to bearer, ibid. [1394 1]2 Article D. Article K. My Lords would be unwilling to consent to any provision which dispenses with the necessity of the retention of a register in the case of a bank with a Royal Charter. 6 . The proposal relating to the issue of notes is, no doubt, an improvement upon, the proposal contained in the original Concession, on the assumption that paragraph 3 of Article 6 in the original Concession is cancelled by Article 3). But the securities against which two-thirds of the circulation are proposed to be issued would not be specially pledged to the note-holders, and the amount of the issue^ i _^^ &gt; to be allowed would be far in excess of the limit which has invariably been placed on^w all banks of issue incorporated by Royal Charter since the Bank Act of 1844. That' limit is that the total amount of notes in circulation is not at any time to exceed the amount of the paid-up capital; and my Lords would not feel justified in countenancing a departure from that limit, which was laid down by high financial authority, and has been sanctioned by long usage. My Lords do not appreciate the foice of the woids, “ rphe metallic reserve may always be in bullion.” It must be practically necessary that part of the metallic reserve should consist of coins by which notes can be cashed. 6 . My Lords are glad to find that the bank will now devolve upon others such mining and industrial business as is contemplated by the promoters of the under taking, which business under the original Concession was proposed to be combined so incongruously with the business of banking. 7. The other Articles do not appear to call for remark; more especially as my Lords wish to limit as far as possible their criticism upon the details of the project. On learning that the proposed additions to the Concession have been modified in the respects indicated by this Board, and that the additions as modified have received the approval of His Imperial Majesty the Shah, my Lords will be prepared to consider with the promoters of the Company the terms of a Royal Charter. It may be well to state, for the information of those concerned in the undertaking, that the limitation of liability which has been granted by Royal Charter to Banking Companies is not the amount of the shares, but that amount and as much again.

I AM directed by the Marquis of Salisbury to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury for their consideration, a copy of a letter from Baron Julius de Beuter,* requesting the grant of a Royal Charter to a State Bank for which he has obtained a Concession from His Majesty the Shah of Persia.

Baron Reuter to the Marquis of Salisbury.—(Received June 22.) My Lord, 18&gt; Kensington Palace Gardens, June 21, 1889. AS your Lordship is aware, I have recently obtained a Concession from His Imperiar Majesty the Shah for the formation of a State Bank in the Empire of Persia. t „ I at once drew up regulations for the management of the Bank, on the oasis oi an English Limited Liability Company, which have been approved by the Persian Govern ment as being strictly in conformity with the said Concession, but which, according to eminent legal authorities here, do not harmonize with the Joint Stock Act for the following reason:— , 11 ^ f The Joint Stock Act does not limit the liability of shareholders to the amount ot their shares in a bank enjoying the right to issue notes. # On this ground it would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain subscription ot the capital. , ^ £ I am advised that this difficulty, which would effectually bar the participation ot the British public in this enterprise, can only be successfully overcome by means of a Boyal Charter. Though I am aware that it is the practice of the Privy Council not to grant Charters where the same ends can be attained by any other method, yet I would venture to point out that there are many financial institutions established in London (notably Oriental and foreign banks) on which this privilege has been conferred. The only objection to such a measure that presents itself to my mind is the tear of an intention on the part of the Bank to issue notes in British territory; I beg, therefore, at once to assure your Lordship most emphatically that the Bank pledges itself to refrain from such a course, and to add that its Organic Statutes debai it fioni such a proceeding. . . I may be permitted to remind your Lordship that the new Concession was only obtained by the surrender of the old one, and that I consented to waive many of m} former privileges on the assurance that the carrying out of the new instrument would be of immense benefit to this country; in these circumstances I take the liberty of most earnestly soliciting your Lordship to obtain for me the indispensable Charter for securing these great advantages for this country.
