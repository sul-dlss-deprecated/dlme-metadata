It has also become necessary to strengthen the staff at Ahwaz and His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has proposed that an officer should be obtained from the Government of India to take over His Majesty’s Consulate there. The Government of India have offered to provide a suitable man with a good knowledge of Persian and Mr.Eden is anxious to accept this offer.

Sir, In my despatch No. 41 (29/17/42) dated February 12th I had the honour to transr&amp;lt to you a despatch from His Maj sty’s Vice-Consul at Isfahan (No. 3 of the 6th February) in which Mr. Wiltshire reported signs that an important Soviet consular post was to be established in Isfahan and gave his views on the status of his own post. 2. Isfahan is not one of the places , menticn ed,ln my . telegrams Nos. 95 and 96, where the Soviet Government have insisted on being allowed to establish consular posts immediately but even if they had not already sent an unofficial representa tive there it is not to be supposed that they would neglect the only important manufacturing centre in Iran, with an industrial population such as is particularly susceptible to Bolshevik propaganda. Apart, however, from the question of Soviet representation in Isfahan there remains the question whether the importance of the area, and the additional functions which His Majesty’s Vice-Consul is called upon to perform at this time, do not justify the raising of the status of the consular post at Isfahan, which is at present a Vice-Consulate dependent upon Shiraz. 3. I have consulted His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz on this point, and he is of the opinion that His Majesty’s Consular representative at Isfahan should be a full consul, independent of Shiraz. In practice it has been arranged that Isfahan shall be directly dependent upon Hir Majesty’s Legation for all matters of importance, so that no time may be wasted, but it would be very useful if the holder of the post could have the rank of consul, as it would give him greater weight in his dealings with the local officials, whose work in connection with security and food supplies he is expected to watch, stimulate and control. At the same time I do not wish either to ask the Treasury for more money or to change in essentials a situation which is admittedly created for war purposes, and I therefore suggest that the Vice-Consul at Isfahan - at present Mr. Gault - should have the personal rank of Consul. I trust that this proposal will be approved and that I may receive a reply by telegraph. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department. I have, etc., (Sgd.) R.W. Bullard.

Brenan Esq., O.B.E., His Majesty’s Consul, British Consulate, SHIRAZ.&gt;35 ■m — \ r LxIriUTE. Please see submission at P.Z.1776/41 (flagged in attached file) and at Ext.6079/41. The recent steep rise in the cost of living in Persia ? as shown by Annex I to the despatch from H.M. Vice-Consulate at Isfahan below, has already led to an increase in the wages of the staff at the Shiraz Consulate (Ext.7871/41) and at the Tehran Legation. Now that Isfahan has been reopened as a Vice-Consulate the staff there can no longer augment their salaries by outside work. The Foreign Office propose in view of the rise in prices and the return to full-time duties of the staff, firstly that the Gatekeeper and Farrash should be provided with free uniforms etc. and that their wages should be increased by 1,800 rials per annum and 1,200 rials per annum respectively from the 1st November, 1941, and that the Gatekeeper should also be paid at the rate of 3,600 rials from the 1st September (i.e. an additional 100 rials per month for two months), and secondly ’they propose Lhat the salary of the Clerk-Accountant should be increased from 12,480 rials to 15,600 rials per annum. This involves a sum under £100 (about £45 per annum) and can therefore be sanctioned by this Office without reference to India. Tb. (XnjrujuU Volt &lt;?^ b**- U. eJn/\Jr £ Jio fa flud ) UfVNAca-f Coif df /iia J oJica*JL~ £ x\ The Foreign Office also put forward a proposal for an increase in the salary of the menial staff to be made at the discretion of the Vice-Consul, within the limits of 30C-40o rials per month (see paragraph 4(b) of the Vice-Consul's despatch below). The Vice-Consul also suggests that he might be allowed discretion to raise the salary of the clerical staff within the limits of 1,200 to 2,000 rials per month?* As the cost of living in Persia has risen and is rising so rapidly (the salary of the Consular Clerk has been increased twice within a year) this would probably save much time and trouble. Since this involves a question of principle a draft letter to the Government of India is suomitted; together with a draft letter to the Foreign Office,concurring in the immediate increase in the rates of the menial staff and Clerk Accountant. /t'Wr tu.

Mr. Eden wishes to draw the special attention of the Lords Cartfulaeioncra of His Majesty's Treasury to the plight In which these employees find themselves as a result of the steep rise in the cost of lining, which haa already caused local offices of the Persian Gover n ent and local branches of the British Ban &lt; and the Oil Company to increase the wages of their taeniei staff. The menial staff of His Majesty's Vice-Consulate will be unable to carry out thuir duties, which huve greatly increased since the time when only a Consular Hest House wee maintained at Isfahan, unless clothing for office wear la supplied in addition to payment of the increased wages which have been recommended. M present they ere barely living above starvation level and arc quite unable to meet the expenditure on uniforms, caps, overcoats and shoes which their new duties necessitates. In these circumstances I an to express the hope that Their Lordships will approve in principle the supply at public expense of uniforms etc. for the menial staff. d. In addition, Mr. Kden wishes to recommend the adoption of the proposal in paragraph 3 of Hr. Consul Bremen's despatch, whereby Hr. ’/ioe-Consul Wiltshire will havs discretionary power to increase the wages of the menial_ staff, within the limits specified in paragraph 4 of Mr. Vice- Consul Wiltshire’s despatch, when the rise in th^s cost of living obliges him to do so. I am accordingly to express the hope that Their Lordship# may be moved to gl c their assent to this proposal, and will also sanction the following increased wages*- Oats eeper 3,600 rials per annum from the 1st In this connexion it shouivi be explained that these two employees are the ghui&amp;cas whose existing wages of 2,400 rials per annum ©aoh were sanctioned in Treasury letter S. 6373/9 of the 27th March, 1941. September, 1941. 4,800 r-als per annum from the 1st Love&amp;ber 1941. Farrash 3,600 riels per annum from the 1st Kovenbvr, 1941. /4 The aeorst&amp;ry to the Treasury4.

A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office in order that the necessary /approach may be made to the Government of India.

V of 1 st October, 1941.Sir, British Consulate Office Isfahan. 1st October, 1941. 3T) of your despatch No. 1 (5 8/58/41^ of the 19th September last on the subject of Consular representation at Isfahan and Shiraz, to submit a report on the extra expenditure likely to be incurred in the reojoening of Isfahan as a permanent Vice-Consulate. small office some fifteen feet by twelve. It is rented at 450 rjaLs a month, on a three years lease dating from the 18th August, 1940. , The office is inadequate for a consular officer and his staff as well, there is no waiting room and there is no other room to expand into. I consider further accommodation necessary therefore, and suggest that a dwelling-house be leased in the vicinity for_the officer’s residence. The rent of a house of five or six rooms would be 600-1000 rials a month. If the present office lease could be broken by agreement with the landlord, a new combined office and residence could perhaps be taken, and in many ways this course would be preferable. The extra expenditure in the second eventuality would be about the same, and it might be less. 3. The present rest-house would then be turned into a consular office. The office furniture is of poor quality, but it would suffice for the present if, say, £20 were allowed for local purchases as need became apparent. A ’’British Consulate Isfahan” shield is available, as are also a ’’British Consulate Isiahan” wax seal and ink seal. There is no corresponding date-stamp, but something could be improvised locally. A steel press in which to keep confidential files is really necessary, although I do not know whether this can be supplied. A second typewriter would be very useful although, knowing the present scarcity of machines, I hesitate to say that it is strictly indispensable. 4. A telephone should be installed. The receiver costs 800^rials, two’batteries'50 rials, say 1000 rials with the cost of installation. The telephone department does not supply these articles, but only brings the wire up to the house. Telephone services cost 25 rials a month. 5. The safe is a good Hobbs bolted steel safe with a key lock, the key being at present kept in a small combination- lock cashbox borrowed from Shiraz. It is large enough to hold a set of cyphers, but cannot take much more. I imagine that in present war conditions it will not be possible to supply a combination-lock safe for Isfahan, and that therefore the present safe will have to suffice for the cyphers. 6. With regard to additional staff, you have already kindly sanctioned the engagement of an interpreter, in your telegram Ho. T/12 of the 15th September. I have found a suitable/ His Majesty’s Minister, etc., etc ., etc ., British Legation, Tehran.suitable man for this temporary post* and he will assume his duties from the 1st October, at a salary of 1500 rials a month. A report on this matter will follow. 1 consider that in all probability another clerk will be found hecessary when the office gets going on a permanent basis, as Hr. Aratoon may not be able to carry out all general tasks. A suitable clerk can be found locally at a salary of 1200-1500 rials a month. I therefore include him in my estimate, leaving his ultimate engagement optional to the consular officer in charge of the post* 7. With regard to the consular officer*g proposed residence, I consider that in view of Iranian conditions it is reasonable to ask that one gardener and one door-keeper should be paid from public funds. The cost of each servant would be .about 250 rials a month. 8. The furniture, etc. which is at present in the rest- house could be moved to the consular residence where it would form a modest nucleus for a war-time domestic establishment. Perhaps a grant in the neighbourhood of £50 could be sanctioned for removal and refitting charges and for any article of furniture or.equipment additionally necessary in the new house. Beyond that the consular officer would no doubt purchase his own requirements, which would remain his personal property. 9. _ I have summarised the above estimates in the table which I have the honour to transmit herewith, to which I have added £25 for unforeseen expenses, both permanent and recurrent.

The present mchlUiey^hi^-f-uTlder- stand is about 10 years old, is quite finished, and the cost of a thorough oye^aul and refit is estimated at ' 10Go Rials. I do not consider that the machine, whose frame has already been broken and repaired, is worth that expenditure. 3. A new Raleigh bicycle would cost 2200 Rials, and I should be grateful to receive authority to spend that amount, if possible. There is a chance that I iiay be able to get an almost new machine for 1800 ^ials. The old machine could be sold for 80-100 Rials. 4.

J/VC^VCX. P-0. The Consulate General at Isfahan, the normal establishment of which consisted of a Consul-General and a Vice-Consul (F.Z.4556/30) was a Foreign Office appointment, half the cost being paid by the Government of India under the arrangements for the division of Consular expenditure in Persia. The Consulate General was incorporated in the Consular district of Shiraz in 1933 fP.Z./8246/33), the Consulate Buildings were sold in 1935 fP.Z.224/36) and suitable premises were rented for the accommodation of the staff and for the Consul on his periodic visits from Shiraz fT.Z.1668/36, P.Z.4747/39) a moiety of the cost, about £500, falling as a charge upon Indian Revenues (P.Z.4115/36 and P.Z. 5934/37). In March of this year an increase in the rate of pay of one clerk and two ghulams was sanctioned (P.Z.1776/41) . In view of the present importance of Persia,the need for further Consular representation,and for increasing the number of officials with local knowledge (the Government of India have themselves been posting political officers in training there, see Ext.4877/41) the suggestion seems a good one. The cost of maintaining the Consulate General was estimated by Sir Reginald Hoare in 1931 as £2500 per annum~(P. Z.485/33 paragraph 9, flagged in attached file).
