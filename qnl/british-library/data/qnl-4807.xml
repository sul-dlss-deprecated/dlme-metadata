The gas buoy was laid on the 8th November 3916 as soon as a sup- ply of carbide became available, but was placed north-westerly of the position of No. 4 Buoy (since removed) at the turning-point in the channel as revealed by a regular survey. (3). The provision of a fourth buoy is awaited; as the buoys are liable to damage and have to be removed for charging, it is necessary to retain one buoy of a series in reserve. Meanwhile a large Caa buoy forming a conspicuous mark has been placed in this posi-r , nr, &lt;» rpo’iil'ir survey the suggested position for the old Outer (4). and ° u n 0 y ^ sfoand to be too shallow, and, as dredging operations had been commenced by the Director of Port Admrmstration and Conservancy on a line between this buoy and ^o. 4, the Cute Gas Buoy in its original position became a fair lead for the dredged channel.

It is suggested by Masters of vessels in the Company's employ that if Buoys No. 9. on the inner bar, at No.6,, au No.4 and the outer bar were fitted with flashing or occulting lights it would enable the vessels to pick up these buoys more easily at night; and also that it would further assist lightering if the Fao light were altered from a fixed light to either a flashing or occulting light. It is understood that at present the Fao light is fixed, red, suspended from a pole. 2. In Their Lordships' opinion the suggestion as to the lighting of the four buoys in the channel leading over the Bar of the Shatt—el—Arab is good, and if lighting is carried out at all no less a number of light buoys would effectively answer the purpose: the outer bar buoy, however, according to information in the Admiralty, is already a Light Buoy, though possibly its light may not be in actual operation* The substitution of light—buoys for the remaining three buoys mentioned should prove of no special difficulty.

The proposed change in character of the red fixed light at Fao to a Flashing or Ocoultirg Light would, however probably present considerably greater difficulties, and it would have to be left to the Authorities on the spot to decide whether any effective alteration of this nature could be carried out. The necessity for this change is, however, not so essential as the substitution of the light-buoys* The attached chart cutting shews the relative positions of the buoys and of the Fao light. 4.
