On the 31st of August last, telegraphic instructions were received from Teheran to despatch my heavy baggage tQ Ispahan, and, after handing over charge of the Shiraz Sub-Division, to proceed post and catch up Captain P. Molesworth Sykes, Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, who was at the time nw/e from Shiraz to Ispah m, with a view to gaining all the information possible from him regarding the country through which it was proposed to construct the Central Persia Telegraph line. Making over charge of my Sub- Division on the 3rd of Sep ember, and having despatched my caravan on the 6 th, I started &lt;£ Chappar ” on the lOth, an ), overtaking Captain Sykes on the 14th, entered Ispahan with him on the evening of the same day, my caravan coming in on the 19th. Detailed instructions were .awaiting my arrival in Ispahan, and preparations were instituted to make an early start on the work. The original orders were, in the first place, to examine the routes which emanate from Ispahan and debouch on to the Yezd-Kashan valley, in the hopes of finding an easier country through which, to divert the already constructed line, which at present surmounts the high and formidable Kohrud Pass, Prom Kashan, I was to post to Teheran, there to receive my final instructions. It was therefore decided to make a start with the examination of the Ispahan- Ardistan route. Circumstances, however, lead to a modification in my instructions, as, on the eve of my departure from Ispahan, September 23rd, a telegram was received ordering me to accompany Captain Sykes as far as our respective routes lay together, and not to come to Teheran. Leaving that officer at Ispahan on the 24th of September, with the understanding that we should meet at Nain,—a town at the junction of the Ispahan with the Kashan-Yezd caravan route,— I proceeded to Ardistan and thence to Nain, where I found Captain Sykes on the 3rd of October, and leaving the following day we travelled together to Kerman, which was reached on the 1st of November. Eighteen days were spent in Kerman in writing a preliminary report on the route which had just been iraversed. We had also to await the arrival of a special courier from Teheran with final instructions and with presents, while we were fully occupied in purchasing stores and in organising our caravan for the long journey to Siestan. A start was made from Kerman on the 19th of November, and we travelled together through Bam and Regan, across the desert to Khash and Lad is, where we spent Christmas. From Ladis, letters were desoatcaed to Mr. Arm strong, of the Indian Government i’elegr »pbs, who was examining the trade route from Quetta to Malik Scab Kul&gt; via Nushki and Amir Chah, giving him particulars of my movements, an l asking him to try to arrange a meeting at Malik Seah Kuh on January 5th. Leaving my travelling companion to proceed along the usual route to Malik Seah Kuh, I took 10 running camels and 10 days’ supplies, and left Ladis on December 26th, going due west to Galugau down the Hood Mihee to the eastern edge of the DashtT-Lut, with a view to examining the direct road from Ladis to Regan. From Rood Mahee, a bee-line was taken north to Dozdab, thence to Malik Seah Kuh, where Cintain Sykes joined me on January 6 th, and we proceeded together to Siestan, where we arrived on the 18 th. Four days were spent in Sie 3 tan in buying supolies and forage and in organising a new caravan; and a short report on the Kerman Bam-Regan Sections was also submitted to Teheran. I parted with Captain Sykes on the 22nd of January, and returned to Malik Robat, which was reached on the 26th, Captain Webb-Ware accompanying me for part of the journey. Here, I met Mr. Armstrong, and after spending a day with him, I left on the 27th, and cut across country due west to Nasrat- abad, and thence south across the Dasht-i-Lut to Regan, which was reached on February 10 th. From Regan, a new route was traversed to Bampur via Bazman. b 7—6Introduction— continued . 1 was delayed at Bampur from the 22 nd to the 27th of February for want of transport, and it was only through the Deputy Governor’s kindness in placing 15 of his camels at my disposal that I was able to make a start for Gwadur via Serbaz and Peshin on the 28th of February. At Sunt-i-Sir, near the Perso- Kelafc Frontier, I was met by an escort of 6 mounted Balooch sowars, which the Agent, Governor-General, Quetta, had kindly placed at my disposal. Gwadur was reached on the 13th of March, some 6 months subsequent the date of my departure from Shiraz, during which period a land journey, a pied et d cheoal, of 2,299 miles had been accomplished. The British India S.S. “ Khandalla ” picked us up on the evening of the 19th, and did a record run to Karachi in 24 hours.iii CLASSIFICATION OF REPORT. In making the following report on the result of the preliminary survey of the route for the proposed Central Persia Telegraph line, it has been tnought expedient to classify it into 4 heads :— A. Description of the track followed. B. Gazetteer. C. Sites for Telegraph Offices. D. General Summary. 2. Before dealing with the main line, the branch section from Ispahan to Ardistan for the diversion of the already constructed line via the Kohrud Pass has been disposed of. 3. As a further facility towards reference, it has been considered desirable to divide the proposed route for the new line into 5 sections and to entirely dispose of one section before taking up the next. These sections are— I. Kashan to Yezd. II. Yezd to Kerman. III. Kerman to Bam. IY. Bam to Regan. Y. Regan to Pahra. 4 . The other routes examined and considered “ unsuitable ” are divided into 4 sections— First, Regan to Ladis via Khash. Second, Ladis to Rood Mahee via Galugan (with two appen dices, giving a description of che track from Rood Mahee to Siestan and the return journey to Malik llobat). Third, Malik Robat to Regan via Nasratabad. Fourth, Pahra to Gwadur via Serbaz. 5. The appendices are 6 in number, in addition to a skeleton of Curzon*# map of Persia and a section plan of the route from Ardistan to Pahra giving the altitude of places :— (a) Table of distances. (b) Statement showing freight from the soa-coast to the interior. (&lt;?) Chemical An dyser to Government report on samples of water. (g?) Statement showing cost of journey. (e) Statement showing disposal of presents. ' (f) Short glossary, Persian and Balooch words. 6. My distinees were measured with a cyclometer or perambulating wheel, which was tested at Ispahan before starting with both tape and chain, and which showed an error of 25 yards per mile, or 1 , 42% . The wheel was again cheeked at Gwadur, and gave the same error, which has been eliminated in each stage. The heights were taken with 2 aneroid barometers and 2 bypsomcters, which were found to be practically correct on my arrival at Gwadur.A.

The walled gardens continue on the left (west) up to 1 3o7 miles, when the road goes due east down the right bonk of the „ayemWi rood. A 1 - 73 miles, the road again turns due north, crossing the Zayendeh rood by the Chahar Bagh-i-toneh bridge. The entire length of the bridge is 390 yards, width of roadway 10 yards, and it has a paved ramp or causeway from either end The masonry is good and in repair ; there are 33 arches. The bridge at 1-952 miles. The Indo-European Telegraph line runs along the top of the left parapet of the bridge, which parapet is about 12 feet high. e la ar Bagh-i-Koneh is then entered, which is a fine avenue, about 50 yards broad, with Chen ir trees up its centre, and four tanks, respectively passed at ^ 2- 20 2-4(i0 and 2 612 miles.

A tall minaret is seen 26 yards to tHe ngnr f 913, while the Bakooch Khaneh, a brick building where tl ^ ^rnors of Ispahan are wont to repair to receiye Khalats or Decorations sent to them by the Shah lies 150 yards to the left. At 3179, a stream of sweet water 5 feet by 1 is crossed, flowing west to east. Road still continues almos c ut n&lt;2 At 3*238, a line of Kanats flowing to Bartun is crossed, while at 3*79, the walled village of Saifabad was reached, where we halted for the night. The road is good and level throughout. The soil is loamy and sandy, and presents no diffi culties for the construction of a telegraph line and is open to wheels. Note.—The roads in Persia are on the plains a series of tracks, at times 10 to 12 in number, spreading over a total width of 60 to 70 yards without ditches or boun daries, while in the mountains they are reduced to a solitary mule track some two or three feet broad, and in many places too narrow to permit of two laden animals passing each other. Saifabad to Koomeshah. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 25th September 1898 ... 3 Koomeshah, 5,291 feet. 17*32 24T2 Prom the village of Saifabad, the road keeps a north-easterly direction with fallow land on either side, going flat and easy. At -883 miles, a stream of sweet water, 6 feet by 1, is crossed, while at *890 Kaleh Seydan is passed on the right, 200 yards off, and Kaleh Batun 600 yards to the right, east—both small walled villages. Bourje-i-Arzenan is seen 60 yards to the right, east, at 2*048, and the Imam Zadeh of Bacheh Zainab 30 yards to the left (west). At 2*70 miles, a sweet water stream is brought to the surface by Kanats and is formed into a canal 7 by 2 feet, which, keeping on the west side of the road, flows past Daek and is also used in irrigating Zalindar, which is reached at 5*107 miles, lying 500 yards to the west, left. A canal, at present dry, but said to be full from October to April, and wffiich works a mill lying 50 ya*rds to the right, east, is passed at 6*198. Prom this point, 6*198 to 6*678, there are five or six small empty canals, which are crossed by bridges of wooden beams and earth in good repair. These canals offer no obstacle, and are very shallow. The road still runs almost due north, and at 8*328 crosses a line of brackish water Kanats. Another line of Kanats with sweet water is crossed at 9*273, and at 9*518 a small stream of^ sweet water. Aliabad is reached at 9*625, and we may say that the cultivation and arable land of Ispahan practically continues up to this village, a distance of 13*46 miles. At 10*220, four lines of sweet 'water Kanats are passed, and after crossing another line or two of Kanats and a little cultiva tion and fallow land surrounding them, the large town of Habibabad is reached at 11*309 miles. At Habibabad, two routes branch off, one going to Natenz, and the other to Gez. A line of sweet water Kanats, with a descent thereto, is reached at 13*412, while at 14*680 a small stream of brackish water is crossed with the Bourji of Akberabad lying 80 yards to the east, right. 15*043 brings us to more Kanats, and 17*32 to the village of Koomeshah. The whole road is flat and easy going, and is open to wheeled traffic. A uniform distance in spans could be maintained. 'From Hahibabad to Koomeshah, 6 miles, the soil is sandy with a little salty efflorescence, but this would not damage iron. Koomeshah to Khasehtarash. Date. No. of March. » Route. Intermediate Miles Total Miles. 26th September 1898 ... 4 Khasehtarash, 6,368feet 13*94 38063 Starting from Koome«hali at 6-45 a. m., a very gradual ascent is made over an open plain, with a bearing of 43° or N-E, along a good firm gravelly road. At 1‘92 miles, a line of Kanats is passed, running west to east. The track con tinues up the plain, is splendid and rises very gently. At 5 372 miles, a path joins in on the east or right rear, which goes down to Habibabad direct, leaving Koomeshah one mile to the west. Muleteers travelling from Habibabad to Khasehtarash, and not wishing to stop at Koomeshah, take this road, which is said to be a mile shorter. At this same point, 5*372, Jahanabad is seen lying about a mile to the west, left. A valley is entered at 6*05b, with low rocky hills about one mile to the east, right, and miles to the west, left. Road bears 56°, and is splendid. At 9*895, the hills on the right, or east, recede to 3 miles, while those on left, west, approach to half a mile. Good grazing in this valley. A bifurcation of the road takes place at 10*01 miles. The one to the left, north, goes to Bagherabad, bearing 42°, thence to Sholgistan and Katenz. The Khasehtarash road bears 74°, and gradually ascends. Erom 11*150 to 11*210, a dry torrent bed with a gravelly bottom is crossed. The ground on either side is good and firm. It is said to contain a little water in winter. Bhagherabad is seen at 11*210, lying about four miles to north, left. At 12*860, some ruins are passed at 10 feet right and 50 feet left, and we pass through a defile, the rocky hills coming down to 30 yards on the right, or east, and 25 yards on the west or left. Erom 12*963 to 13*531, the road keeps in the bed or on the hank of a small dry torrent bed. Khasehtar ash is reached at 13*94. The road is splendid throughout, open to wheel traffic, and is stated to be never blocked. It is principally used by camel men, muleteers preferring to go from Koomeshah via Bagh-i-Shah to Natenz, which is considerably shorter ; hut there is a bad pass on that road, said to be blocked in winter. Up to this point, the whole road from Ispahan is fit for wheels. Khasehtarash to Bagham. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. y* 27th September 1898 ... 5 Bagham, 6,604 feet. 18-21 56*27 The road from Khasehtarash goes due east, gently ascending: a valley about one mile broad with good firm going to *750, where it unnecessarily enters a small dry nullah and follows it till *850. The ascent is very gradual to 3*844 miles, where a slight descent is made. The ever-narrowing valley is only 400 yards wide at this point, but again broadens out to the right, or south-east, and possesses good grazing. The surface soil is a sandy-earth with a rocky bottom. At 4*348, the road gradually ascends and the rocky mountains to the right and left, east and west, which have been running parallel to us so far, now open out on the right to a plain four miles broad, which debouches on to the great Ispahan plain. The small village of Chah Reeca, bearing 122°, is seen lying to the right at 4*348, while at 5*325 a small knoll is crossed, and we go over slightly undulating ground to 5*890. We enter some low sand-stone hills at 6*98,' and another road from Habibabad to Natenz crosses our route here. At the same point, the hills on the left or north cease, and give place to a large open plain some 12 miles by 8, on which several flocks of sheep were seen grazing, and which stretches over towards Sholgistan. At 7*525, a spring of sweet water is passed one mile to the right or south, and at 8*713 the hills on the right recede to two miles. This excellent road continues, and at 12*010 Hassanabad is seen lying three miles to the right. Another road to Sholgistan crosses ours at 12*582, while at 13*39 a grove of trees is noticed to the right three miles off, but there is no habitation or perennial water here. 13*862 brings us to the end of the plain: 13*940 road to Jumbeh is passed on the right. At 14*415, the open water-4 shed with low hills on .either side is Hie descent to Barham is likewise easy. At 15 84, Jumbeli is sc. n lyi „ mile to the rio-ht ° From 17'678 to 17-927, we go down a dry torrent bed Set bv I' wUile'the valley is 150 yards broad, with firm ground on both sides sloping up to the hills: no obstacle to a telegraph line ; only m case ot excess ve rain is 5 there a flow of water. The whole road so far is opened to wheeled traffic. The “ pass ” is a misnomer, as there is none ; it is nameless. Several donkeys were encountered drawing up mill-stones four f ~ e V“ ^ thick, which are hewn in the neighbourhood, this and the altitudes will . ow the very easy gradient. Ba.gham to Ardistan. Date.

This torrent bed is occasionally flooued m a rery rainy rear but as the -round on either side is sloping, high and firm, a safe alignment, jould be found by keeping on the high ground. Should a f | ood ^gl^miies IS said to subside iu 24 hours. The drainage area is very sinall. At 2 99-, mle the valley widens out to 500 yards with rocky peaks on s ’ d “’^ north-west, and a mountain track to Ardistan strikes off to the left, north nest, rroad is seen going to Zavareh at 3-24, while at 3'458 two peculiar rock ,,, lars catch the eye on the north-west range. They are 15 to 20 feet high and have a Strikin- appearance to two human figures. The valley divides at 3 93o, i torrent bed w P e have been following taking the 200-yards ravine to the ri S 1 north-east, while the direct Ardistan route goes due north or to Jejeft, throngl a valley 300 yards wide with rocky peaks on both sides.

This is, however, no obstacle to a telegrap line At' 5-146, the torrent bed is left, and an ascent made up a rocky knoll at 5-225, which culminates at 5-3:35, the aneroid showing 5,7o0 feet llio .o, d continues over low rooky knolls or diminuhve hills, and .^ ot 'P a&lt; ; 1 strikes off to the right, east, to Masbandee.

The valley widens to half a mile on the’left and 200 yards on the east, right, at 7-644, and at 7-750 Bedeshk is seen lying to the lei ,half a mile off. The road rs aTwS no ^ descendin ' to the Kashan Yezd plain, which is reached at 8 118, at which point the hills cease. At 10-672, a small Ab ambar is passed on the left, which is s id to contain rain water for two months, December and January, yearly. At 12 976 Ze road to Zain is seen on the left, and at 13-412 a second Ab ambar of stone and mud with a burut-brick, arched roof 21 by 9 ^S^t is passe which contains water three months annually. At 16 299, the Mo liar roar 3 crossed then a line of Kanats leading to Ardistan and a stream oi ?ood watei, also going to Ardistan. We camp opposite the caravanserai at 16-35 on the southern end of the town. The main caravan and chappar road from Kashan to Yezd is struck at Ardistan,■&gt; 7 24^ September 1898. Saifabad.

A ten-minutes’ ride from our camp through walled guldens, in which were an abundance of pomegranates, mulberry and fig trees with patches of cotton and castor! brought us to the dilapidated chaparkaneh, the roof of the balakaneh of which had tumbled in.

Ardist an —contin ued. Kemtrks— continued, stone foundations and baked brick domed roofing. It was noticed very few of the houses had windows, the glass having to be brought from Ispahan, which greatly enhanced the price. Another ride of 15 minutes took us through more walled gardens. In addition to a chapar- kaneh, Ardistan possesses two caravanserais, a post office and one large burnt-brick mosque, called the Masjid Jomeh, and four smaller ones; also 9 or 10 public baths. The revenue is stated to be 18,000 tomans. There are about 50 villages within a radius of 12 miles, and up wards of 80 within a radius of 16 miles, such as Zewareh, with an estimated population of 7,000, to little villages of 50 houses each. Zawareh is said to excel Ardistan in buildings, mosques, gates, etc., but cannot compete with it in richness of soil and produce. I noticed the Ardistan soil was particularly rich. The produce of other places, such as Catchoo, with a population of 1,000, centres itself at Ardistan, which is on the junction of the Y from Yezd to Kashan, Ispahan to Kashan to Teheran, Ispahan to Arad an andShahrood. The Gover nor was a very nice man, and the people were much pleased with him. He has been appointed only six months. Ardistan is famous for a camel hair shawl (Rufarshee), about 3 yards by 1, of a brown and closely woven stuff, which is sold at krans 20 to 25, and also a chintz known as chitz and sold in lengths of 3 yards at 1^ krans.

The total distance is only 72*61 miles.D. GENERAL SUMMARY or THE BRANCH SECTION FROM Ispahan to Ardistan.19 Genebal Summary. Of the 72 61 miles from Ispahan to Ardistan, the first 38 miles pass over the Ispahan plain in a north-easterly direction, and the road is practically level. The hilly sta^, extending from Khasehtarash to Bagham, 18 20 miles, presents no didiculries, as the hills are open and of relatively insignificant height. The actual watershed, 4 miles to the south of Bagham/ is also open and has an e’evarion of only 7,064 feet, the ascent to it being scarcely percep tible, while the descent is equally gradual. Local information tends to prove that this route is never blocked, snow which falls in the morning melting by sunset. 3*92 miles from Baghara, the road to Ardistan bifurcates. I followed the left track, which is the more direct, but it is rough for half a mile, whereas the right track follows an open valley and is better for wheeled traffic. There are no rivers, marshy ground, or swamps, while for the greater part of the route the soil is gravelly but firm, and would be easily worked. The climate, which resembles that of Ispahan, is good throughout. Sweet water is abundant, and supplies are procurable at comparatively short distances. The recently developed town of Habibabad, with an estimate!! population of 10,090, lies on this route, and supplies of every description can be obtained there. I would therefore venture to state that, after taking into con sideration the other possible directions for the line to follow, this route appears to me to be in every way the most suitable. I therefore beg leave to propose that the present line via the Kohrud be dismantled and re-constructed along the above-mentioned route. At Ardistan, the Central Persia Telegraph line is struck, and bearing this in mind it will be clear that a gain of some 23| miles would be ensured, Kashan to Ispahan via the Kohrud being 96 miles, while the distance from Ardistan to Ispahan is only 72'61 miles. Having disposed of this diversion and relegating alternative routes to an enclosure, we will now approach the question of the route that the Central Persia Telegraph line should follow from Kashan to Pahra.ALTERNATIVE ROUTES or THE BRANCH SECTION FROM Ispahan to Ardistan. 1. Kashan to Ispahan {via Natenz and Moochekhor) 2. Kashan to Ispahan {via Kohrud). 3. Kashan to Ispahan {via Nain).23 1. Kasuan to Ispahan {via Natenz and Moochekhor) 104 miles. Both from what I saw of the lie of the country and from the account of it «-iven to me by Captain Sykes, who travelled from Kashan to Kuhpa via Natenz, this route cannot offer the same facilities as the one proposed by me for the following reasons :— ( 1 ) 10, shan would be on the trunk of the Y, where the line to Ispahan and that to Yezd bif urcates, and would thus become a very im portant station, which would appear undesirable, owing to its notoriously hot and unhealthy climate. (2) The stage from Ispahan to Tarek is, I am informed, something between 32 and 36 miles, without water or villages en route. (3) The country between Kashan and Tarek, and especially between Natenz and Tarek, hugs the Kohrud range, and is much cut up by water-courses. 2. Kashan to Ispahan {via Kohrtjd) 96 miles. As you have already reported so strongly against the Kohrud pass, and have recommended that the present line should be dismantled and taken to Ispahan by another route, it would appear that any further remarks by me on this point would be superfluous. However, in addition to the objections to the Kohrud pass itself, I would mention that— (1) The pass at Lagareh, 8,400 feet between Ispahan and Nain, would probably have to be surmounted. (2) Advantage would not be taken of the main caravan and Chappar road from Kashan to Nain. 3. Kashan to Ispahan {via Nain) 220J miles. The third and only other practicable scheme of dismantling the Kohrud line, and of bringing it, as well as the new line as far as Nain, and constructing the branch line into Ispahan from Nain would also appear to be unadvisable, owing to the considerably greater length of line involved, and the greater altitude of the Lagareh pass.« DESCRIPTION of the TRACK OP TEE PROPOSED ROUTE FOR The Central Persia Telegraph Line.

The toad keeps a south-easterly direction over firm gravelly soil, is good, and gradually ascends the valley throughout the maich. At 2/t), a stream of sweet water is crossed, flowing to Ardistan, while two mills are respectively passed at *370 and *072. A line of kanats which has been on our right, and from which the abovementioned stream emerges, gradually recedes to 6'JO yards at 2'40 miles, where it appears to end. 4* 11b, wo pass an ab ambar 2a by 15 by 5 feet, containing sweet water (rain\ which is built of stone and mortar, and is cemented ins'de.

This torrent lied we either cross or keep on our right, at varying distances of 0 to 100 yards, for the next 7 miles, or to ll*8Un, within 3 miles of Zaterkand, where a ramification takes place. The road between these points is consequently, at times, cut up an l rough, though passable to wheeled traffic. Zaf/rkand is situated on a col with hills on thiee sides in a horse-shoe shape, and as the valley gradually slopes down from these hills to the road, this torrent bed takes off the drainage ; but as the ground on every side is firm and high, no damage would he done to a teb graph line. At its worst point, 5'5G7, where the channel i&gt; confined, its width is 180 yards with an 8-foov, hank on the left and a 4-foot hank on the south. The large village of Cachoo is passed at (TIG miles, lying 4 miles to the left, w esi, and at tihe same ] oint the road from Bngham to Oachoo is crossed. I think the line should keep the centre route up the stream to within a mile of 1 akiabad, whence if, should come to Zaferkand. A stream is seen about 300 yards to the left at 6*^0 miles, which era iually approaches the road, and at 6 792 is alongside, where it is 18' by 6 feet, flowing 19 feet in 15 seconds, and is sweet, and keeps close to the track till 10T13, whe n we cross it and see it coming from the right. At 9 085, the read bifurcates, the right, west, one going to Takiabad, while ours takes the left, or east. Tlaranj is passed a few yards further up on the west, 4 miles off. At 11 '270, a line of kanats crosses the road, which go to Ardistan. We note Takiabad at 11*83 miles, lying at the foot of the hills to our light, we A, 3 miles off.

From this watershed, the descent is very gradual over an excellent fine gravelly road all the way to Mayesranak. We note two dry ab ambars at the loth mile, respectively 10 and 50 yards on the right, which contain na e. six months in the year—November to April.

The village ends at *24 miles, and Matabad is seen, lying one mile to the south-west, or right, while at ’915 Izabad, ^00 yards to the left, or north-east, and Kafiabad, 2 miles to the right, or south-west, are passed. At 1*176, a line of Kanats of slightly brackish water runs parallel^ to the road, 80 to 100 yards distant on the north-east side, for a quarter of a mile,and then turns off to Mohommedabad, which is passed 600 yards to the north east at 1-769 miles .Between 2102 and 2-291, we pass* Mahrabad and its cultivation half a mile to the north-east, and 3-478 brings us to an ab ambar 10 yards to the south-west, built of sun-dried bricks and containino- stale dis coloured ram water. At 3-820, Chahar Bagh is passed half a mile to the north- ( 'ast Ine excellent road, gradually descending, passes the villages of Hossein- abad and Mehrabad, 5 miles to the south-west, and at 8-940 on the same side, 2 miles off, Kharzan is seen. A second ab ambar of burnt brick and cement, with six steps leading down to the water, is passed at 9-59 miles. This water is also tainted and undrinkable. Jelalabad we note at 11-44 on the ri«ht or south-west, 3 miles off, and at 13-080 R-iheemab id, 6 miles off, side. A ruined ab ambar of burnt brick is passed ’at 14-919, 15 left, or north-east, and a line of Kanats, within 10 yards’ of containing brackish water, is passed on the south-west at 16-156 gardens begin at 17-297, 400 yards off, to our left.

A second blue domed mosque is passed at '76, lying about 200 yards to the left, or north-east. -The road to Bambeez crosses ours at '92 and the telegraph line crosses to the left at 1’49, where the gardens end and a short lane is traversed. A dry ah ambar is reached at 1-60 miles, 5 yards to the right, and at 1 68 the Mlahalleli Nain, a suburb of that town, is seen lying in a hollow, about 600 yards to the left, or north-east. A line of brackish water Kanats is noted at 1'80 and a second line at 2-21 flowing to Abachoo, a small hamlet 600 yards to the north-east, which is passed at 2-46. Mazreh Shah lies 600 vaids to the south-west at 2'75 miles. The telegraph line crosses to the left at 3-07 miles, and a few yards further on a line of brackish water Kanats, flowing down to some cultivation on the north-east, is passed, while at 3-94 the v iilage of Bafioon. is seen 300 yards to the south-west. Afore brackish water Kanats appear at 4-34 miles, while at 4 86 a similar line of Kanats, openino- out into a stream 18 by 9 feet and flowing 26 feet in 15 seconds/is crossed Ihere is a small patch of cultivation here, the last seen en route to Noh Gumbaz. Close to this, at 4 93 uiles, is a ruined sort of carvanserai, known as Pekider- akht, aud at this point the line crosses and keeps to the left, or north-east, for the rest of the stage, at varying distances of from 100 to 600 yards off. There b 7—830 is practically nothing to write about from this point till Noh Gnmbaz is reached at IS 1 -mileZ The road is excellent and firm, over a firm gravelly sandy flat plain 4 and keeps a south-easterly direction, ever descending. 1 note that at 6-37 miles the villages of LorJistan and Shuja respectively on tbe nght and left, or south-west and north-east, about 3 miles oil, are passed, 'hi c _ Bambeez, also on the south-west, is seen 3 miles off.

At 4 miles, a dry torrent b p d 40 yards by one foot is crossed, and the telegraph line, which has kept on the left, or north-east, is now on the right, or south-west. A second small torrent bed is met at 6 miles, and iust before this point the telegraph line again crosses the road to the left and keeps on this side to Akda. A dry ah am bar is passed on the south-west at 11 miles, and after this there is practically nothing till Chah Nao is reached at 14'20 miles, lying on the left of the road. This is a small village in a tort and has a supply of slightly brackish water in a tank, slightly undulating ground is traversed till 17*04‘miles, where there are a few tamarisk trees grow ing in a nullah. The line crosses to the right at 17-918, but again goes to the left at 18-153, at which point another dry ab arabar on the right is noticed. I measured some of the telegraph spans here and found they varied between 90 and 110 yards. At 20 06, the first village seen since Noh Gumbaz is passed, lying 6 miles to the right, or south-west, at the foot of a small range of hills. It is called Mazreh Noh. Close to the road on the left at 21| miles, the village and gardens of Shahrabad begin, which, though separated from it by nearly 3 miles and with the intervening garjipns of Kosheabad, may be looked on as ft suburb of Akda. These gardens end at 21 683, at which place there is a pond of sweet rain water, of which the animals drank freely, this being the first sweet water met with since Nain, a distance of 40‘233 miles. At 22‘060, the road bifurcates, the left one going to Ardikan, via Shamsabad, and the right to Akda. A line of slightly brackish water Kanats flowing to Hosseinabad, one mile to the left, or north-east, is passed at 22-653. The gardens of Kosheabad begin at 23-425 and end at 23-785, and hound the left side of the road. In this short distance, 6 or 7 lines of sweet water Kanats are passed. The houses of Akda begin at 23-790, and at 24*23 the walled Kaleh or town is reached. The Chap- par Khaneh and the caravanserai are on the extreme S. E. end on the left. The telegraph line runs through the town and emerges on to the right side of the road at its south-east end. Akda to Pa Gondeh. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles.

Shamsabad we note at 1-885, and skirt it on the south. The road is very stony and rough at 2-62 and continues so up to 7*03. The telegraph line crosses at 4'915 to the left side, or south, and keeps on this side till 5-232, when it again crosses to the right and lies miles distant for the rest of the march. A bifurcation takes place at 5*12, Uie right, or south, track going direct to Maibut, while we follow the left to Ardakan. iVn ah ambar of sweet water is passed on the right at 5 192. Dagdagabad is seen lying 3 miles to the north at 7-03 and Deh Nar, one mile off on the same side, at 8*257. A new ab ambar, almost completed, of burnt brick, lies on the north, or left, at 8*6^,.and at 8*73 we pass Sarv, about 200 yards off on the same side, while the new village of Aliabad on the right, or south, is passed at 8*850. The road now turns to the south-east and enters some low sand-hills. At 9*07, a stream of brackish water is crossed. The road to Mehter branches off at 9*112, and Mehter itself is seen at 9 625, lying 50 yards to left, or north-east. At this point, 2 roads branch off, the right one going to Chafteh, IJ miles off, and the centre one to Se^ud Jkur Adeen, half a mile off, while our road runs due east again. Continuing among very low sand hills, Mirza Amin is passed at 11T43, 400 yards to the north, and at 11*165 a line of sweet water Kanats, which have steps leading down to the water, which is slightly brackish, is reached. Shagoon, 600 yards to the left, and Mirza Hakeem, on the road to the right, are respectively noted at 12 lo5 and 12 590.

The suburo gardens of Ardakan Wnn at 5*58 miles on the left, or north-east, some 4 miles off, with the village of °Paizabad. 6*180 brings us opposite to Mazreh Agha also 4 miles off. These gardens gradually approach the road towards Ardakan. A line ot brackish water Kanats is passed at 7*08, and at 7 804 the large village of Turkabad is on the road to the left, or north-east. We now turn to the south and sand-drifts are noticed here. The going, too, is heavy The gardens end and recede on the right and give place to a sandy plain to 9-090, w ^ len ^ le cultivation of Ardakan begins, and the road again goes south-east. A hue road with cultivation on either side is followed to 10*65, when die At 9*967, the line crosses to the left. A fine ab ambar is passed at the right, and the lanes end at 10*88 and give place to cultivation. We reach the west town ga f e at 11 miles, and the telegraph line is again seen on the rMit. Skirting the town wall with its moat and passing the telegraph Office at'll*132 on our left, we reach the second gate at 11*292 and the third gate at 11*34. These respectively lead to Maibut and Yezd. The telegraph line is seen going off to Yezd, bearing 156°. The road on this march is excellent throughout. Just outside Ardakan, there is some sand which drifts up asrainst the walls, but which w'ould not alfect a telegraph line. I could see Maibut lying 8 to 10 miles on the right, and the ground seemed to me to he much cut up by Kanats and water-courses. The Pa Gondek road is the better, and has better water, and I think more villages on it. Akdakan to Roknabad. Date. No. of March. ♦ Route. Intermediate Miles.

It was noticed car riages had been along here, but at times, owing to the narrowness of the road, they had to leave it and go across country. The telegraph line is seen going otf to the south-west to Maibut and is only 200 yards distant here. iSherifabnd is passed on the left, 200 yards off, after half a mile’s going. At ’73, Baghistan, or gardens, start, which are kept up till L42. Maibut with its suburbs is seen about 4 miles off to the right, and extends for a distance of 3 miles along that side. Dehabad we leave 2 miles to the right at 2'29 miles. The ground on our left, or east, is very much scored and cut up with Kanats, and owing to the soft sandy soil the rain has intersected it with many courses. Jaferabad is passed on the lelt 50 yards off at 4 36, and the large village of Shuruk extends from 4 812 to 512 on the same side. We notice Mohammadahad at 4 - 81, lying a mile to the right, and Bargeen is passed on the same side at 6-03 miles, 600 yards off. On our right, we have cultivation till 6-064, when the ground is again much cut up till 8*455, where it somewhat improves. Deh Sheikh, 200 yards, and Badrabad, 600 yards to the right, are respectively passed at 7*370 and 8*165, A deep ravine is crossed by a burnt-brick bridge at 8 455, and the vmao-es and cultivation end here. Owing to the heavy going, it had taken us 2 hours to do the 9 miles from Ardakan to Roknabad, and as this is the best place to stop we halted here. The sand and the narrowness of the road make the going heavy, hut it is nevertheless open to wheeled traffic. I think mis route is better than the Maibut one, as it does not seem to be cut up to the same extent. The country, too, is more open that ground Maibut bein°- a succession of continuous gardens for 8 or 9 miles from Ardakan. Roknabad to Hujatabad, Date. No. of March, Route. Intermediate Miles.

After 20 minutes’ going, the Maibut road joins m on the right, or south-west. At 1-098 miles, over to our V e °r ntryi ! a A n f WOrk ofKa ^ts, and it would appear the reported o7 Kanats going to Ardakan are here all visible. On our leftf is -oodfirm barren ground. Mobommcdabad begins £0 yards to the left at S'Ol, and the ruins of this once very large village continue to 3*955, nearly a mile. At the latter point, is a stream of sweet water ; and here, too, a road branches off to Askezar, a large village bearing 150°, while we turn more to the east with a bearing of 115. Tiie Kanats are too numerous to mention, but generally run parallel to us on the right. At 5*255, the ab ambar of Shavaz is passed a few yards to the right. Ibraheemabad and Shamsee, lying about 800 and 600 vards to our right, are respectively passed at 6*035 and 7*014 On our left, the sandy plain stretches to the mountains, some 20 miles off. Two more ab am bars are noted at 7*260 and 7*765, 5 yards to the right, while from the latter point the road passes through cultivation and fallow land till 8 618, at which point yet another ab ambar, dry, is found. Izabad, a large village 400 yards to the rio-ht is passed at 8*350, and on the same side Sherifabad and Himatabad with the Chappar Khaneh or Post house, respectively 3 miles and 300 yards off, are passed at 8*815 and 9*20. In fact, the whole right is a string of villages and cultivation, practically contiguous to one another. The next 2 miles are over a sandy but firm plain, and at 11*342 the sand-drifted knolls begin. Once in amono* these knolls of 100 to 150 feet in height, the view on either side is obscured, but by climbing one of them Kereemabad is seen two miles to the left at 12*310, Hassanabad at 13*713 and Hosseinabad at 14*330. The cultiva tion of Huiatabad begins at 13*820 and continues up to the serai. The road amono* the sand knolls where it is blown bare is good and firm ; but at times the drifts lie across the road and the going is exceedingly difficult. In fact, it is inadvisable to bring the line this way, as the sand shifts about, and if a line ran through these knolls we should probably soon have part of it buried. Htjjatabad to Yezd. Date.

B. maps shown as a swamp), a slight ascent J made from it to the top of a ridge. From here, the sand drifts are seen stretching away to the left, while the right is cultivation and villages with sand drifts in the distance. This cultivation keeps along on the right side for the fir t dnes and on the left from A3 to 3'39 miles There are many large villages in this distance, such as Mirjoomird at A3 miles, one mile to the right, Feroozabad, with its cypress trees, at -975, a quarter o a mile off on the sum &lt;bdo Zach at 3 miles, lying half a mile on the right, and liabad, a larsee village through which the road passes. At 4*482, the road from Hossemabad ioins^in on the left rear, while at 4*675 the end of Zach is reached The road at 5*368 enters a barren sandy stretch and the going is heavy to 6 6, when the village of Nusratabad is passed 200 yards to the left, with its mill on the rio-ht side of the road.

The times and estimated distances are now given. Leaving the bank at 6-45 a.m. on the 13th, we passed through the Yezd bazaars and streets, and at 7-5 a.m. through the Chahar Minar Gate, at which the Chappar Khaneh is situated. At 7-15 a.m., the telegraph line crossed the road and keeps about 200 yards off till 9-5 a.m., when it crosses to the right. The bearing of the road is 315°, and this is kept throughout. At 7-45 a.m., 5 miles, the road to Himatabad branches off to the right. At 8-5 a.m., 7 miles, Arnabad is seen three-quarters of a mile to the right. At 8-15 a.m., 8 miles, the road passes through Yakhchee, a deserted village, and at 8-25 a.m., 9 miles, Lack is passed, 2 miles to the right. The sand hills are only half a mile off on the right here. At 9-20 a.m., 14J miles, the hut of Charkh Ab, with excellent sweet water, is passed. The line crosses and re-crosses the road 4 times in this distance. At 10-15 a.m., 19J miles, the ground is low-lying and appears to be under water an winter. At 1T5 a.m., 24| miles brings us to Bonderabad with Himatabad one mile to the right. Halt at 11-5 a m. to 1 p.m. Continuing after lunch, 1 p.m. to 1-15 p.m. we pass through the large villages of Maimuneh and Bonderabad, then through a howling desert. At 2-20 p.m., 29 miles, we join the Maibut road at M.azreh Khan. At 2-30 p.m., 30 miles, Ibraheemabad is seen half a mile to the right and at 3-5 p.m., 33| miles, Mohmadabad on the same side. At 3-20 p.m., 35J miles, the Bocknabad cypress is one mile off, and bears 14°. At 3-50 p.m., we pass through Shamsabad, and at 4 p.m., 37 miles, we reach Maibut Chappar Khaneh. Thom Bonderabad, the line sweeps round to the left, or west, avoiding the cut-up ground round here, and comes into Maibut at the Chappar Khaneh, The road is good throughout and open to wheeled traffic, but water and supplies are very limited, and in places it runs through an absolute desert.Maibut to Yezd (Chappar).

End of Maibut gardens 6-20 a.m. and end of cultivation 6-30 a.m., when we pass through Bargeen. Keeping along the top of a good firm ridge, we are opposite Roknabad, one mile to the right, at 7-15 a,m., and reach Kalantar (Parsee village) at 7-30 a,m. Bearing of road 132°—Sherkuh 174°. At 8-30 a. m., we see Hajiabad, a large village two miles off, on the left, and at 9-35 a. m. reach Kerimabad, 15 miles, with Aliabad close by. There is very good sweet water here. The road from Kalantar to Kerimabad is excellent in every way. The sand knolls are left well to the right, west, and the road keeps along a natural ridge, about 200 yards wide, of firm gravelly soil, which is so straight and level as to make one imagine it is artificial. The bearing of the road at Kerimabad is 129°, the Sherkuh 182° and the Parsee Dakhmeh 143°. At 9-40 a. m., we pass through Hussanabad and see Hujatabad lying 2 miles to the right, west. 9-55 a. m. brings us to Hosseinabad, distance 16 miles. Halted at Hosseinabad in a nice white-washed Bala Khaneh with 3 rooms, belonging to a Haji and situated on the north-east side of the village. The water here is slightly brackish. Left Hosseinabad at 1-30 p. m. Bearing of Feroozabad cypress 202°, Hujatabad 220°, Sherkuh 184° and the Parsee Dakhmeh 149°. At 2-5 p. m., we pass between the Parsee Dakhmeh and Ilabad, respectively three-quarters and half a mile on left and right, and at 2-30 p. m. join the main road from Hujatabad at 4*482 miles from that place and 9*518 miles from Yezd. This is a perfect road throughout, and is the one the line should take. As I was chapparing,^ ray distances cannot be absolutely relied on, but I should say it is 37 miles from Yfczd to Maibut via Bonderabad, and 40 miles back via Kalantar.

The climate of Yezd town is not good, owing to its situa tion in a hollow surrounded by sand, which, with the least wind, passes in drifts all over the town, impregnat ing the wdiole place. During last summer, three of the seven English residents were laid up with typhoid, one case ending fatally, while the other four residents had to resort to the mountain village of Deb Bala, 7,992 feet, for the summer. From what I could gather, the lowest temperature in winter only just goes below freezing point tor a short time, wdiile in summer it rises to 95°. This is of course a dry heat. ... Captain Sykes writing in September 1894 says he ' noticed a hostile feeling towards the Europeans in Yezd.” During our visit, we were shown every civility and respect., and we could not have arrived at a more inopportune time as the town was on the verge of bread riots owing to the scarcity of grain. This better feeling towards Europeans is greatly due to the tact and good will displayed by Mr. S. Eerguson, the popular Manager of the Yezd branch of the imperial Bank ofYezd— continued.

I traversed the length of Yezd, through the crowded bazaars included, with the cyclo meter, and although, as must naturally be expected, the people exhibited a certain amount of curiosity, hustling and jostling, which might have hsen legiti mately looked for, were remarkable only by their absence. On my arrival in the Bank street, I found a crowd of some 800 to 1,000 people who had come to ask Mr. S. Ferguson to intercede for them by sending a telegram to Teheran, in the hopes that an order might be sent to the Governor to reduce the abnormally high price of bread. The hard work of Dr. White, of the C. M. S., whose doors are ever open to all sorts and conditions of patients, and the splendid reputation he has established as a Physician have also greatly tended to bring about the desired change. Yezd is the head-quarters of the Parsees or Gabrs in Persia, of whom there are some 6,000 in and near the town. These live in a separate quarter of the city, the south-east, where the Europeans are also located. In former times, the Parsees, as well as the Jews, were much persecuted by the Musalman population, but I think this is dying out, and they appear to carry on their avocations without molestation. They are ^ princi pally agriculturists and gardeners. Certain privileges are restricted, such as wearing the Persian kolah or hat, riding on a donkey, which, however, cannot materially effect their welfare. Yezd possesses a Telegraph Office, a Post Office and a Chappar Khaneh. With the institution of an English Telegraph Office, which would give a reliable means of communication with India on the one side and England on the other, Yezd would become a very important commercial centre and a good market for British and Indian export.

Concluding tliat the new line as well as the diversion tion—Ardistan. to the already constructed line will run from Kashan to Ardistan, where the lines would bifurcate, it would appear desirable to place the first control station at Ardistan, which is a large town with an estimated popu lation of 12,500, with a good climate, where there is excellent water and plentiful supplies. Commercially, too, Ardistan is of no mean importance, as not only is it on the main caravan route from Kashan to Yezd, hut it also carries on a considerable traffic with Ispahan to the south and Shahrood to the north. The garden known as the “ Kolah Earingee,” (European hat), while in itself suitable for a Telegraph garden, only contains an octagonal building, which would be quite inadequate to accommodate the staff or to do duty as a Telegraph Office. The best site for an office would be on the south-east, about 2 miles from the actual town, which boasts of many large gardens in this direction, and at the same time conveys the information that the water enters the town from this side. Objections may be raised to the short distance of the section from Kashan * to Ardistan, 65J miles, but I venture to point out that, in addition to this section, which would carry 6 wires, there would be the section from Ardistan to Ispahan, 72J miles, and another, 56J miles, from Ardistan to Kain to be controlled.

At Nain, the west side of the town, and about a mile from it on the Ispahan road, appears to be the most suitable place for an office, as the water-supply would be tapped be fore it reaches the town, and the high dry ground taken advantage of.

The third station would be at Yezd, one of the Station—Yezd. lagest towns in Persia, with'a population of 55,000 in habitants, the province at present forming a distinct Governorship under the Adl-ed-Dowleh. An account of the climate of Yezd is given under the head of “ climate ” in the gazetteer; and as it is not good, I think that it would be a mistake to have our office in the town, if it could be avoided. At the foot of the mountains on the Shiraz road, _5 miles to the south-west of Yezd, and connected with it by a good road and some 700 feet higher, is the Bagh-i-Khan mentioned in Captain Sykes’s report. This fine garden, some 7 or 8 acres in extent, with an abundance of excellent water, contains a house of burnt brick, which has a large Talar or arched room, and 8 other small rooms, with a fine cellar, not to mention out-houses. The garden was laid out 33 years ago by the then Yaseer of Yezd, and cost, I was told, 33,000 tomans, which sum would, however, appear to be overestimated, as it was sold some time ago to Haji Muhammad Hassan, formerlv the Mint Master in Teheran, for 7,000 tomans, and could perhaps be purchased for the last-mentioned amount. The place has not been properly looked after and is in a state of disrepair, but I think, owing to its excellently healthy site and good water, the office and staff should be located here, if it can be purchased at a reasonable price. A considerable sum would have to be expended on repairs, after which I think the accommodation would be ample ior an office, the Senior , Clerk and two unmarried men. Yezd. Cost of Material.

SECTION I, FROM Ardistan to Yezd.68 General Summary. 1. I have not traversed, and am therefore not in a position to speak from personal observation on the section from Kashan to Ardistan. It is nevertheless essential that some reference should be mode to this necessary link in the chain of communication. From what Captain Sykes told me, and as the intervening country to Kashan can be practically seen from Ardistan, also as carriages are known to have traversed the road, I feel assured that the section of 65^ miles cannot offer any obstacle to the construction or subsequent maintenance of a telegraph line. The stages are given on the margin, and in addition to sweet water being obtainable at these villages, “ ilawz,” or sweet water tanks, are met with between the stages. Several villages are also seen lying at comparatively short distances from the main road. 2. Reviewing in general terms the first section of the main line from Ardistan to Yezd, between which towns the Caravan and Post road was followed for almost the whole distance, there is nothing that presents any engineering difficulty. The road is mostly firm fine gravel, running along a vallev averaging 16 miles in width, and is open to wheeled traffic throughout. The watershed separating Ardistan and Nam is crossed about midway between Zaferkand and Nyestenek, and is 6,987 feet, and is said to be never blocked. In order to avoid a dry torrent bed running in a parallel direction to the road from Zaferkand to ArdKtan, the line should be kept on the south-west side of the valley, actually proceeding to the village of Takiabad, 2 miles to the south-west of Zaferkand. The next two stages to Nain are ideally suitable. Although there is no perennial water met with between the stages on the actual route, there are villages to the right and left from which water could be carried. At Nain, the Persian Telegraph' line, from Ispahan to Yezd and Kerman across the Lagareh Pass, s^OO feet, is struck. The Persian Telegraph line follows the route we selected for the first two stages, and formerly went direct to Maibut, a large village south-south-east of Ardakan, where there was the Telegraph Office, instead of to Ardakan, the reason being that the Post house or Chanpar Khaneh is at Maibut. As Ardakan is a much larger and more important centre than Maibut, the line was subsequently diverted to it, and the Telegraph Office and Post Office transferred. The Chap par Khaneh is, however, still at Maibut. The road followed by us from Akda via Pa Gondeli to Ardakau is in every way suitable for a line, whereas the ground round Maibut is much cut up by kanats and torrent beds. Tim Persian Administration would require an office at Ardakan, as the Governor resides there, wdiile it is also necessary to come to Ardakan to be on the direct Hne which I recommend for the next section. 3. The usual Caravan road was followed with the perambulator, but a serious obstacle in the shape of a belt of shifting sand drifts, some 100 feet to 150 feet high and about 5 miles in width, at once made me decide that this route should, if possible, be avoided. Enquiries instituted led me to under stand that timre were four roads from Ardakan to Yezd—* (1) that referred to above and fully described in the Track Section, which is the most direct. (2) that via Maibut and Himatabad, which the Post follows, lying to the S. W. of No. (1). (3) that via Maibut and Bmderabad, to the south-west of which is the Persian Telegraph line. This route lies to the south-west of Nos. (1) and (2),‘ (4) that via Kalantar and Hosseinabad on the north-east side of the valley. A day’s halt at Ilujatabad, during which an examination of the surrounding country was made, proved taau routes (3) and (4) nursing the mountains on ^ne south-west and north-east, respectively, were freer of sand than the two middle Altitude. Stage. Miles. 3178 .. Abuzaidabad .. 17 3178 .. Kalatabad .. 17 S116 .. Moghar .. 14 4024 .. Ardistan .. 17£64 routes Nos. (1) and (2) running along the ralley. I therefore decided to proceed to Yezd, and, after a day’s halt, to chapoar back alon&lt;: route No. (3), and return to Yezd again bv route No. (4). The result was mf&gt;st satisfactory. Route '3). although almost free of sand, is at the same time almost destitute of villages and water, and to avoid the sand drifts the Persian Telegraph line is kept at some distance from the track to the south-west, and finally swings round into Maibut, and thence goes due north into Ardakan. The following day I posted back to Yezrl. Crossing the valley in a north-easterly direc'ion from Maibut to Roknabad, I joined a good road near the Parsee village of K'alantar. Thence, the going is excellent to iiosseinabad, which lies 1^- miles north-north-east of Hujatabad. Prom Hosseinabad, the road is again good, and joins the Yezd- Hujatabad track at 9 miles from Yezd. This last-mentioned route, ^so. (4), is absolutely free of sand drifts ; it is open to wheeled traffic and passes through the villages of Kalantar, Kareemabad, Aliabad, Hussanabad and Hosseinabad, where supplies in fair quantities are obtainable, and the water is sweet. Un fortunately, there are no caravanserais ; otherwise, it would become the main caravan road, muleteers at present preferring the Hujatabad route on account of the fine caravanserai at that place, although most camel caravans use the northern route. Prom what has been written, it would therefore appear that route No. (4) possesses greatly superior advantages from every point of view. The two days that were spent at fezd, after returning from my post ride, were not unprofitably occupied iu collecting general information and in examining the surrounding country with a view to selecting a Telegraph garden. We were fortunate enough to find in the Bagh-i-Khan the advantages of a good climate and excellent water, and I have recommende i that our office should be located here.DESCRIPTION or the TRACK OP THE PROPOSED ROUTE FOR Central Persia Telegraph Line.

A sharp turn to the right, south, is made, the going being still sandy and very heavy. At L87 miles, the position of the new European cemetry is seen on the east,’and 2 075 Mebdiabad, also known as Golnabad, are passed on the right and left, respectively, lyin about half a mile off. The main Caravan and Ohappar road is joined at 2*49 miles, and continues in a south-easterly direction, is good and firm, and gradual ly ascends.

At *136, a stream of sweet water is crossed. A path from Mohommedabad to the hills joins in on the left rear at -562, and at *761 miles a disused mill is passed, 5 yards to the right, while a line of kanats, crosses the road at *988 miles. Another mill, in ruins,on the Mehriz road, half a mile to the right, is noticed at 1*063 miles. The Persian Telegraph line, which has so far kept on our left, or north-east side, crosses to the right at 1*11 miles. Our direction to this point has been south-east by east, and we now go south-south east. Continuing along an excellent gravelly road, with a very gradual ascent, there is nothing to note till 4*059 miles, when a track branches off to the Ab-ambar of Reza, which is passed at 4 60 miles, about 200 yards to the right. There is again nothing to note till 7*86 miles, when the village of Takiabad, 600 yards to the left, is passed. The mountains on our right gradual ly recede, and must be 5 miles off at this point. A track, bearing 137°, branches a off to the right at 7’94 miles, and goes to Harofteh, which is not visible from the road, but is said to be 4 miles off. Zainabad we go through at 10*68 miles, where there is a good stream of sweet water flowing across the road. The Ls/J-iPersian Telegraph line makes straight across the sandy plain to Sar-i-Tezd, which k here visible, while the road keeps oo firmer ground to the left Mav reh Vaze»r some walled enclosures, is passed to our immediate right at 12 03 miles This is a now place, but the water hawing dried up it is uninhabited at present.

The cultivation of Sar-i-Y ezd ends at *530 miles, while at *725 miles the Persian Telegraph line crosses the road, bearing 137° and goes up to join the main route at Ziin-ed- Deen. The Post road can practically be seen throughout our march, nestliog the mountains 6 miles off on our right or south-west. At *985, a track strikes off to the left east, leading to a range of low hills, and at 1*565 miles the road from Harufteh to Zam-ed-Deen crosses ours. From this point, there is absolutely noching to note—not a knoll, an undulation or even a torrent bed to mar the “ even tenor of our way ”—till 7'21 miles is reached, at which point the Mazreh Shur and 2 or 3 small nameless hamlets are seen 6 miles off to our right. These hamlets are said to be occupied by “ Shams,” a mountain race. The road from Harufteh to Gird-Kuh joins in at 7’10 on the left, and a quarter of a mile further on a line of slightly brackish water kanats is passed. Again for a stretch of 7 miles, we continue over an excellent road, gradually ascending, with nothing to note till the Faraj road joins in on the left at 14*775 miles. The only village passed en route, Mazreh Ali Heza Khan, lying 50 yards to our right, is reached at 15*05 miles. It has a stream of delicious water. A few yards further on, w r e reach the col connecting the solitary Gird-Kuh with the main Surkhui range. The distance between them is 400 yards. At 16-81, we pass the “ K deh ” of Gird-Kuh on the left, while the Gird-Kuh is some 600 yards to our right. We camped on the bank of a stream on the eastern extremity of the village.

These Kanats are dry at present, but it is anticipated a village will in time spring up in the valley, and water lead down to it. The Gird-Kuh keeps about 2 miles distant to the right, the road raiming along the slope, while a valley some 8 miles broad stretches to the left. The south-eastern end of the Grird-Kuh is reached at 9-52 miles, and the main range of mountains is now some 15 miles to our right, with an intervening strip of Kavir, which is coated with a thick salty efflorescence, while on our left the ground, which has been firm gravel to this point, turns into a “Kaviry” description. Kermanshahan on the main road can be seen bearing 168?, and the Shims Kuh 162°. The road continues firs* and )od, with a strip of Kavir on both sides to 13'29, when the ground is am good. A line of sweet water Kanats crosses the road at the above point, while a second line is passed at 13 75 miles. • Mehdiabad, the first of a cluster of seven villages, is reached at 13-87 miles, and lies to our immediate left. Our tents were pitched opposite to Banderoon, another village nearly a mile further on, but as Mehdiabad had an abundance of sweet water and shady gardens, we changed our camp to it.

The road, whici as so far been shaping its course east-south-east, now runs due south-east, the Telegraph line crossing it from right to left at 6*50. Villages, cultivation, am fallow land a&lt;?ain give place to a gravelly desert, level and easy going, wun nothing to note tiil 10 miles, when the line crosses to the right.

Continuing over a good level road with desert on both sitfes, in a south-easterly direction, we pass Ismailabad, 2 miles to our left, at 7'62 miles, and on the same side half a mile off Vakeelabad at 8’77. ibe read now bears more to the east, and at 10'54 miles a stream of sweet water is crossed, flowing in the direction of the large village of Sherffabad, which is passed at 11*61 miles about 1 mile to the left. The ground here, between the 10th and 12th miles, has the appearance of being subject to floods. Lie Persian Telegraph line goes through the worst part, so they cannot be^ very serious. We again turn to the south-east, and cross streams of sweet water at 13'80 and 14*43 miles. Cultivated land i* now seen on every side, and the quantity of water visible tends to prove that a large tract of country is under irrigation At 14*77 miles, the hamlet of Aliabad is passed on our immediate right with Hafizahad 300 yards to the left. The large village of Kushkuh is reached at 16 65 miles, white Noorabad can be seen li miles off to the ielt. Kushkuh is the usual halting place, but we went on to Goluabad to make the next day’s stage of 23 miles a little shorter. The road is level and good and open to wheeled traffic. As the ground slopes down from the hills on both sides to the road in the valley, the spring and autumn rains wash down and accumulate on the plain, but there cannot beany great depth of water, which must also soon subside. 1 he water and supplies on this section are most plentiful.

Taking a south-easterly direction, tim road continues level and sandv, with high tamarisk hushes on both sides, crossing a dry torrent bed a b 1-63‘and passing the ruins of Hassanabad at P75 miles. _ At P86, a second dry torrent bed is crossed. The ground round here shows signs of being uabio to inundation, and it appears some 3 miles of country is, during abnormal rains, under water. Salabad is passed at 3*40, lying 2 miles to the left. Prom this point, the road goes more to the east, is level and firm, with big i tamarisk bushes on both sides, till the 6th mile is reached, when the bushes cease and give place to desert, with deep sand, which makes the going very heavy. Dafeh is passed half a mile to the right at 6*75 miles. TV e continue to plough through heavy sand with a desert plain on both sides, and keep m an east-south-easterly direction till 10*53 miles, when we again go south-east, A road from Dafeh joins in on the right rear at 11*35 miles, and we change our course to east. The desert stretch practically ends here, as, crossing a stream of sweet water at 11*58, villages with gardens and cultivation are seen on all sides. Neymetabad is passed at 11*94 miles, 300 yards to the riglu* an traversing Himatabad, we leave Kudratabad half a mile to the lett and Kazimabad 600 yards to the right at 12*41 miles, while Hormuzabad flanks the road at 13 40. Shehrabad, Hassanabad and Nooshabad lie on our immedi ate ri°*ht at 13*75, 13*90, and 14*46 miles, respectively, Dehnabad being opposite the last point. On our right or S.-W., desert again prevails, but on our eit at 14*92 miles we have Mehdiabad, half a mile off, with its conspicuous Yakh- chal or Ice house, and the large villages of Laijoon, Kereemabad, Khaleeiabattand Ralimatabad forming a continuous line about to 2 miles off on our left between 16 95 and 21*35 miles. Leaving Kassimabad to our right at 21*50 miles, we camp near a stream and opposite the town of Bahiamabad. The road is level, but there are parts liable to inundation and parts sandy and heavy. During very wet weather, it would be impassable to wheels. Our line will not follow the main road for the first 6 miles but will keep on the south-western side of the valley to Dafeh, to avoid the part liable to floods. The Persian line runs through the*worst place, and apparently does not sustain any damage. The Gholams, however, find it hard work riding through the wet ground. Bahramabad to Kabootar Khan. Date.

Puizabnd 200 yards to the right, Aliabad 600 yards to the left and Sadatabad 200 yards to the right are respectively passed at 2 , 86, 3*74, and 4*50 miles. Up to the last-mentioned point, the road is much intersected by Kanats and by the over-flow of the irrigation water of the cultivation on both sides Taking a more easterly direction, Mohommedabad is passed at 5 56 miles, J a mile to the left, while at 5*86 miles we pass through Abdulabad, which has a stream of clear sweet water and a caravanserai. At 6*20 miles, Kassimabad is seen 1 mile olf on the left. The road is now excellent, gradually ascending a firm gravelly plain, with a line of Kanats running along our right. A track from Kossimabad joins in at 8*86 miles, and we here turn to the south-east. The hamlet of Nasireah is passed at 10*10 miles lying some |th of a mile to the riifiit. The line of Kanats which has accompanied us so far ceases at 11*99 miles, while we again turn due east, continuing over bare, firm travel desert and, gradually rising, we reach an ab ambar with sweet water at 15*75 miles. There is again a barren stretch till 19*74 miles, when a rich growth of high botch appears, and from this and the nature of the soil it is apparent the countrv is at times submerged. The flood line ceases at 20*37 miles. I am inclined to think this must be the over-flow of the Lalezar. The road now becomes very sandy and heavy, with high shrub on both sides. At 22*60, the three hamlets of Grain 8alar, Kakh, and Khanmun are seen some 8 miles off, lying at the foot of the mountains, continuing through heavy sand, the cultivation of Kabootar Khan is reached at 24 miles and, crossing a stream of sweet water, we camp near the Post house. The road, though cut up to begin with, is quite fit for wheels. The greater portion of it is exceptionally good. • T7- Kabootar Khan to PvObat. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermedi ate Miles.

The Telegraph line, which on our starting is to the right, crosses to the left at 1*27 miles, and kt eps close to the road on this side throughout the march. At 1 85, we enter the flood limit of the country, which is here liable to inundation. This is shown on the I. B. maps as a swamp, but it was quite dry when we passed, and from what I gathered it is only alter very exceptional and abnormal rains that ther- is any water here. The soil is of a light yellowish clay, and is the deposit brought down by the numerous tiny streams which drain the hills on either side. The plain is perfectly flat and stretches from hili to hill, some 8 miles, and acts as a sort of basin : it is not a marsh. The Persian line runs through it. When under water, the going must be very sticky and trying. There is no necessity to pass through this ground, as, by bugging the hills on the left and passing through Bakilabad and Kassimabad, firm and secure ground would be traversed. On entering the flood limit, 1'85 miles, the hamlet of Bakilabad was seen 2 miles off to the left. An Ah ambar, containing sweet water, is passed on the rii;ht at 6*17 miles. Kassimabad, also 2 miles to the left, is passed at 6’75 miles, the track from which village joins our road at 12-85 miles. Just a mile before reaching the last-mentioned point, the flood limit ends.

The ruined village of Dowletabad, which is again being resuscitated, is passed at 2‘02 miles, half a mile to the right. At 3 10 miles, our direction is due east. ^ The track becomes somewhat stony at 4*70 miles, a 2-mile bare and stony plain extending to the base of the bills which bound the left, while on our right is a 3-mile plain of soft soil. The stony portion ends at 5*53 miles and gives place to cultivated ground on the right, with the hamlet of Ismailabad lying about ^ a mile off. We have so far bad a line of Kanats flowing towards Robat on our right, but at 6*11 miles the Kanats end, and the road here swings to east-south-east towards Sadi, which we areopposite to at 910 miles, lying J a mile to our right. To our left is again somewhat stony, while on our right is fallow land. A camel track, which branched off at the 6th mile, again joins the main road at 11*86. We here go back to the old bearing of 100° and keep it to Baghin. Ismailabad, J a mile to the right, we note at the 13th mile, and Baghin starts at 14*66 miles, some 200 yards to the right. The caravanserai is reached at 15*03 miles, hut we find a nice house in the village, where we put up. The whole of the right hand side of the road from Sadi to Baghin is either cultivated or fallow land. The route is good throughout, despite the stones in places. Baghin to Sadatabad. 9 - Date.

The going is very heavy through deep loose sand, in which we sank and slipped. The hills on the left are only half a mile off, while the valley on the right is some 15 miles wide and is hounded hy the magnificent Jupar range. Hyderabad and Jaferabad are seen in the valley alxmt a mile off at 2-92 miles. The Telegraph line, wdffch has been unnecessari ly taken over a spur of the Badaman range, crosses to the right at 4'50 miles, and takes a bee line across the plain to Kerman, which can be seen nestling in the Sadi hills some 14 miles off. A splendid view is gained of this mountain- locked city from this point. The hills behind it form three successive tiers : those in the foreground—Sadi - are some 500 feet, the second tier being some 8,000 feet, while the furthest back, the Kupayeli, a sheer scarp and precipitous range, attains an altitude of over 11,000 feet.

''Kerman has a iplendid dry and bracing climate, compar ing favourably with Ispahan and with our summer resort of Gulahek near Teheran, and is undoubtedly a very healthy town. The thermometer during the hottest months, July and August, rarely rises over 80°, while during the three winter months of December, January and February it often falls below freezing point, snow invariably covering the ground for some portion of this time. During our stay, 1st to 19th November, the tem- ...«{ perature varied from 44° at 7 a. m. to 54° at noon, falling again to 50° at 7 p.m., but the nights were decidedly cold and called for extra blankets. Captain Sykes registers the temperature on April 12th as 46° at 7 a.m. and 60° at 7 p. m. During summer, sand and dust storms are somewhat prevalent on the south-west and west side of the town, which borders on the desert plain, extending towards Baghin, which quarter is also more exposed to the sun and where the water-supply is limited. I was very much struck with the civility and respect that wme shown to us by the inhabitants of Kerman. Lading through the bazaars, I noticed that the shop keepers invariablv suspended wmrk, stood up and salaam ed to us. ^ In looking from the effect to the cause f r such special treatment, we have but to remember that Capt. P. Moles worth Sykes has now been Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman for the past four years. Another thing which struck me was the absolutely free, easv and riendlv teims that existed between the (Jonsul and the piincipal Khans and officials in the place, and at the same time the respect which was shown to him—a desideratum which can only be insured bv displaying great tact and judicious treatment in dealing with Persians. i 1 The f evd - Blackett, a member of the C.

It may he looked on as the last town towards the east which is absolutely and entirely Persian in all respects.

Anar, which has a high elevation and a healthy climate, and which is 63-3S miles from Yezd and 123 32 from Kerman, would be the fourth control station. At Anar, there is a good garden, laid out about 5 years ago, 130 by 200 yards and some 5 acres in extent, with a supply ot laii watet, and situated at a distance of about a quarter of a, mile on the north side of the town, which would suit our purpose admirably. The small house of sun-dried brick, comprising four rooms, would not, I fear, prove of much use. 5,000 tomans was said to be the price at which this place could be purchased. Cost of Material.

Fifth Telegraph...Kerman, if mv recommendations meet with approval, Station, Kerman. would be the fifth and the m &gt;st important station on the whole line between Teheran and Karachi. From Teheran to Kerman would be 615 odd miles, and from Kerman via Bazman, Kuhak and Bela to Karachi would be about 837 miles. In the whole of this distance of 1,452 miles, Kerman is the largest town met with, and it certainly possesses a very healthy climate. Its altitude of 5,600 feet would alone be sufficient reason for endorsing this statement. Whether tve shall be able to work the total distance of 1,400 odd miles direct (and I c m see no reason why we should not work direct, considering the very dry nature of the country through which the line will run and the conse quent high and normal insulation that will be insured), or whether it will be necessary to have one translation station at the centre point, can only be decided on by actual experiment. Should it he necessary to resort to the last mentioned procedure, Kerman would un doubtedly be the translation station. In any case, Kerman would be a very important station, as, owing to its peculiar situation near the centre of the line, its importance as a commercial centre and its splendid climate, it would be the head-quarters of the superin tending staff. After a week’s inspection, I arrived at the decision that the healthiest quarter is on the east side of the town, in the Baghistan or Zerees gardens, separated from the city by about a mile and a halt. Capt Sykes rented a nice house here, with 'a large garden attached, for 150 tomans per annum, which, with a supply of water, is valued at 4,500 tomans, and is the property of Nurullah Khan, a well known per sonage in Kerman. Adjacent to it is another large garden with two sets of nice buildings, in very fair repair, the property of the Adl-es-Sultaneh, at present Mayor of Kerman, which I think could be purchased at a reasonable price.

It should be remembered that the general run of the mountains in Persia is from north-west to south-east, and that between each of these parallel range* lies a valley. It is along such a valley that the Kashan-Yezd-Kerman road runs. Again, by remembering that Kashan, the lowest place in the valley, has an altitude of 3,014 feet with Yezd 4,176 feet and Kerman 5,700 feet, while the intermediate villages and towns have an altitude somewhat between these figures, and that the watershed or highest point in this total distance is only 6,987 feet, it will be seen that the country must be almost level, with a fairly salutary and uniform climate throughout. The Persian Government have constructed and maintained a wooden standard line from Ispahan to Kerman, through Yezd, and it must therefore be concluded that we should not experience any serious engineering difficulty, nor would the subsequent maintenance of the line be either expensive or arduous. In fact, on the contrary, the nature of the country, which strongly resembles that between Koomishah and Abadeh on the Bushire-Teheran road, leads me to state that it would be difficult to find so great a distance which offers as many facili ties as the 447 miles from Kashan to Kerman. However, referring in detail to the second section from Yezd to Kerman, we reached the confines of the province of Kerman at the village of Sar-i-Yezd, which signifies the “ Boun dary of Yezd, ” in two easy stages. The usual Caravan and Post road from Sar-i-Yezd to Anar via Zain-ed-Heen, Kermanshahan and Shems, being so strongly reported against by all former travellers, but especially by Capt. Sykes, as “ desert stages , u where the water is brackish and supplies^unobtain able, it was decided to take the route he recommended via Gird-Kuh. This route has certainly superior claims, as supplies are procurable at Gird-Kuh and also at Banderoon. The water, too, is all that could be desired at both villages. As to the extra distance involved by making the Gird-Kuh detour, the actual measurement from Sar-i-Yezd via Gird-Kuh to Shems is 51*11 miles, while Colonel Smith makes the distance via Zain-ea-Deen 46 75 miles, or a difference of 5 miles ; but I do not think it is quite as much. I might mention that the Persians formerly had a Telegraph Office at Kermanshahan. The office is, however, now closed, owing to the bad water and scarcity of supplies. These desolate stages oft times are the scene of highway robbery, the lawless nomads of Pars being invariably the culprits. Such an attack had been perpetrated on Zain-ed-Deen by a band of 12 men en the night we were at Banderoon, and during the fray one of the Persian Government sowar* or mounted men was shot in the thigh. These depredators seldom, if ever, carry their incursions as far as Banderoon or Gird-Kuh. At bhems, we could not avoid camping near the bleak and lonely caravanserai and Post House, but we had taken the precaution of carrying sweet water and supplies from Banderoon. Our horses, however, suffered slightly from the brackish spring that they were forced to drink. Anar, a townlet, is of importance's being the first inhabited spot on the confines of the desert which has just been described, and here we stopped a day in a recently constructed garden, which appeared as if made to suit our requirements. Por any further information on the garden, a reference to Section II C is solicited. We have now arrived at the last section of our journey to Kerman, and follow the Caravan and Chappar road throughout, the Persian Telegraph line being practically adjacent to the track in every part. The first two stages present no difficulties of any sort, but on the third stage, 3 miles after leaving Kush-Kuh, which is a more important village contiguous to Golnabad, the country for 3 miles is subject to floods. Although the Persian Telegraph line runs through the track, and from all accounts sustains little or no damage, I am of opinion that it would he safer to avoid any risk, and that a slight detour to the south of, say, 3 miles should he made. The line would thus run along the foot of the hill* on the south-west side of the valley and cross the nullah at its narrow est point, where it debouches on to the plain, the rejoining with the road being made near Dafeh, a small village, 6*75 miles from Golnabad. Durinr th® rainy season, camel caravans travelling between Bahramabad and Kush-Kuh follow the Dafeh course. Bahramabad, a flourishing town, is the centre of many large villages in the Bafsanjan district, which is the emporium of the » 7—2494 r i a and direct roud connects Bahramab id with Kerman cotton produce. * ‘ p ers ian Gulf, ‘ nl should it in the the important port of Ban er with Central Persia by telegraph, the future he decided to connec e fourth stage is again good over a line would follow this g^at trade at O whi ch 0 point the bare slightly rising pebbly deser ,, , , „ p f orras a strip half a mile wide ground suddenly gives place o Boteh This s P tri p am convin . and has the appearance of ^ d ; flow wou [ d to be ced, take, the overflow of the No. 5, South-West Asia, as being incorrectly shown m • ^ n e\;t sta^e, or between Kabootar Ktn KTese two stages together, the safest course to adopt Khan aud n oa , o •, ,i 10 mn i n r nad leaving Kabootar Khan 2 miles^XfsouLw'and, skfrting the hamlets of Bakerabad and Kassimabad, ^ain strike the main road kt or near Bobat.

Passing the Bagh-i-B liramabad at 1 785 miles, a track from Kerman to Sar-i-Asia is crossed, and the main road from Kerman to Mahun is joined at 2 50, where there is a coffee house. -The country is now sandy with drifts on the right. Lying 2 miles off to the left, the large gardens of Sar-i-Asia are noted at 2 90 miles, and at d’21S the small hamlet of Kojgeen is seen on the same side. Continuing through sandy soil, with sand drifts on the right and open ground on the left, a mud hut with sweet water is passed at 9-035 on the right. The large village of Jupar, which nestles the range of that name, is seen at 10-025 miles, about 12 miles to the right. Gradually ascending over sandy soil, with small drifts, the road leaves the hamlet of Last Gird at 12'25 miles, 2 miles to the left, while at 15*80 the sand drifts end and the ground is fallow on both sides. The large villages of Kinaristan and Langar, lying about 2 miles to the right, are respectively passed at 16 75 and 18 miles. The Mahun gardens begin at 18A3 miles, and we follow a dry torrent bed, very stony, with gardens on both sides. This rough going continues till we reach the houses at 19 miles, and a little further on the shrine is passed 5 yards to the left. Prom here, we went up to the Pirman Pirma’s garden, which lies just 3 miles due south of the shrine and close to a small range in front of Jupar.

This stream we kept on our right for the next 4-965 miles, when it crossed to the left, and at 7-135 disappeared into a line of Kanats*. The Mahun gardens end at f mile, and the first mile marks a mill close to the left. We are now on a stony road, which steadily ascends the valley between the two great ranges of Sufah on the left and Jupar on th« right and is about 10 miles wide at this point, contracting as we proceed. The second mile is marked by a solitary tree 30 yards to the right, and at 2*54 the stones are less, and the road improves. A track joins in on the right rear at 5 miles from the Hanaka- Mahun road. Continuing in a south-easterly direction, we kept to the left of a low sand-stone hill which starts at 6'50 miles, and we skirt this till 9'84 miles, when it ends and the valley again widens out. At 7-40, a path strikes off to B 7—25t|, e left to 8a'och, a small hamlet some 3 miles off, which we note at 879 miles. A stream of °ood water also comes down from Sagoch, which touches our road at 7-50 miles. The 11th mile brings us to a smai dry torrent bed, and we keep up this. The ground is good and flat on both sides. At 12 miles, a r.w of trees is seen on the left and just beyond the small mud hamlet of Zamalabud is reached. 86 The road is open to wheeled traffic throughout, but is very stony at times.

At 1'35 miies, we see the hamlet of Kereemabad lying miles to the right, or south-west, and 2 70 miles brings us to the stone caravanserai known as Hawz-i-Mahmud on the right, while opposite to it, on the left, the village of Arababad is noticed, 2 miles off. A small stream of sweet water comes down from Arababad to the tank at Hawz-i-Mahmud, and it is said the water is turned on every Friday. The tank was full when we were here. The road is now excellent. The end of the Jupar range is reached at the 5th mile, and at 8”10 miles the Kuh-i-Seneh- Jevanan starts, 500 yards to our right. Tne watershed dividing the Kerman and Bam drainage is reached at 10'725, and is 8,450 feet. The valley is 3 miles wide on the'left and 1 mile on the right here, and is open and level. Near here, also, the Goak road branches off to the left. We now make a gradual descent over undulating ground on a good firm road, and reach the end of the Kuh-Seneh-Jevanan at 12-57 miles—a conspicuous landmark, this redish hill. I think it is also known as Kuh-i-Surkh. The valley now widens out to 8 miles, and is dotted with small knolls. Continuing over an excellent road, we reach the brick caravanserai of Neybeed lying in the open valley. The road is never blocked, and as the valley is wide and open, it appears a most suitable route. It is open to wheeled traffic. Neybeed to Khan Khatun. Date. No. of Miles. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 23rd November 1898. 4 Khan Khatun, 5,946 feet. 23'82 7610 As this was said to be a long and trying march, and as T knew there would be no villages to note en route, I sent on the wheelmen over night, and estimated the intermediate distances by my pony’s pace. Steadily descending the open valley in a south-easterly direction, the road was excellent for the first 3’75 miles, when it became stony and entered some low sandstone hills. These sandstone hills gave place to rolling hills at 9*50 miles. At 11-75, a dry torrent bed was crossed. The bed is some 200 yards broad at the road, but is quite shallow. The banks are firm. The 16th mile brings us to a second99 torrent bed, which is 300 yards where we crossed, hut like the first mentioned it is extremely shallow, with a gravelly bottom and high and firm ground all round. The road keeps in this bed, gradually descending south-south-east for the next 5 miles, when it leaves the nullah and keeps on the high ground to the left. At this point, 21 miles, the torrent bed joins another deepish ravine, in which there are many tamarisk bushes. All through from the 9th to the 21st mile, rolling hills extend on both sides. We enter a large plain at the 22nd mile, and pass the mud hovels, known as Nagoor, 300 yards to the left. Continuing across the plain, which is sparsely covered with tamarisk and cultivation, the caravanserai is reached at 2A16 miles. Snow has not fallen here for three years, and when it falls it does not stay. The two torrent beds referred to above contain water after exceptional rains, hut are seldom impassable. Sq flat and level has been the country traversed that this is the first stage on which any really hilly and broken ground has been met with since leaving Ardistan, and is practically the only section on which a uniformity of spans will not be possible. There will be a greater percentage of angles, and also a few extra length poles will be required in this stage. Khan Khatttn to Abarbk or Avarek. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 24th November 1898 ... 5 c3A&gt;' Abarek 5,535 feet 8*12 83*22 Por the first mile and three-fourths after leaving Khan Khatun, the road is good over the loamy plain mentioned in the last march. In this distance, the small mud hut villages of Shamsabad and Kachoolee are noted at *25 and *73 miles, lying 600 yards to the right. Opposite the last mentioned is Saad- abad, 100 yards oif, while 1 , 165 brings us to Dakhcheh, about one mile to the right. Here, too, a stream of sweet wuter crosses the road. The first mile and a half is recorded opposite a mud tower on a knoll 800 yards to the right. The plain practically ends at this point, as at 1*75 miles the road enters the bed of the Tehrud and keeps down it till 3*4 miles. The Tehrud at present is a small stream 10 by 1 feet and is crossed at 2'36, flowing to our left, and again at 3 28, flowing to our right. The river bed with its overflow practically occupies the whole valley from 1*75 to 3*4 miles, which is about 1 mile broad on the left and 200 yards on the right to begin with, and has a range of rocky hills on the left with low clayey hills, much cut up by water-courses on the right, and gradually narrows down to 200 yards. At 3*41, an old fort, Kaleh Zangi, is passed 10 yards to the right, while a few yards further on at 4*16 the road bifurcates, one path going down the left bank of the river bearing 175°, while we traverse a plain which bears 120°. In wet weather, should the river be in flood, a track follows the base of the Tehrud hills on the left, leaving via Saadabad and joining the main road, again at 4*28. Erom 4*28 to 7*12, the road is good, running along a valley with the Tehrud hills on the left and the Abarek hills on the right. The' river goes round the back, or S.-W. side, of the Abarek hills, while we went on its N.-E. side. A col is reached at 5*97 miles, and an easy descent made inio a very large plain. The road to Abarek branches off at 6*3 miles, and we pass that village miles to our right at 7*125 miles. The ruined fort is on the same side, and is noted at 7*375 miles.^ TV e halt near the caravanserai sarteep* The road is passable to wheels, but if the river were in flood, a halt would have to be made at Khan Khatun till it sub sided, as the track along the base of the hills is too narrow. There will be many angles and irregular spans in this section.100 Abakek to Debarzeen or Darzeen. Date. No. of Miles. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 25th November 1898 ... 6 Deharzeen 4,575 feet. 15-94 99*16 This day’s march lay in the wide open plain mentioned in yesterday’s note, the direction being E.-S.-E. throughout, and the country absolutely flat, though stony. We crossed a small stream of sweet water at ‘25, and at l , 4i25 miles Sarvistan could be seen some 7 miles to the right, or south-west. After passing a black slate hill on the left at 2*65,the valley can be seen extending to the left for 9 miles to the Kafufc hills, and to the right for some 25 miles to the lofty snow capped Jamal Bariz range. Not a village nor a hut is in sight, nothing to mar the view on either side, while almost straight ahead a high snow topped peak, bearing 122°, evidently Bazman Kuh, can be seen some 140 miles oif. Ihe 3rd mile brings us to a dry torrent bed, an off-shoot of the Tehrud, and continuing over a gravelly stony plain, with the Tehrud bed half a mile to our right, we cross a second branch (dry torrent bed) at lO’S miles. Erom this point to 13T2, when we cross the main channel, the road lies in the flood limit. The main bed extends from 13'12 to 13'25 miles, when it goes off to the left. The course of this winter torrent is very badly defined, and it can only be traced by^ the tamarisk bushes which grow in the flood line, and yet the drainage is consider able. Its breadth appears to be about 1,000 yards, with no depth, and is at all times fordable. The safest plan, so as to avoid all these ramifications, is to keep to the left, or N.-E., along the Kaput range and leave Deharzeen 4 miles to the right, or south-west. The road from Sarvistan joins in at 15 51 miles on the right, and at 15*75 the Deharzeen mill, with five willow trees, is passed 100 yards to the right. There is another winter road which keeps on the left bank of the river from Bam to Abarek via Bagh-i-Ohemak, and we should follow it. The road is level but stony, and is passable to wheels.

Before a mile had been registered, we entered the dry bed of the Tehrud, and throughout this march we either kept in the channel or on its right bank. Kaleh Ajuree (ruins) was passed 50 yards to the right at 1*7 miles, while on the left, 100 yards distant, we saw Kaleh Arzanee (ruins) at 1*865 miles. Cultivation extended on our immediate right from Daharzeen for 2 miles. The Kaleh Deh Desht (ruins) are next seen 100 yards to our left at 2 83 miles. The river bed kept to our right for a short distance at 3-| miles, and the ground round here was much cut up. Bearing further to the east, we entered the joint river bed at 7'53, and kept down the middle of this, which is some 500 yards broad and of fine-gravel. The ground to our right is much cut up by nullahs,101 r &lt;%’^ flat,tlioi| ml; ■fterpasiii ) the il loft j sw ling to i 'pped p\ l Wtl contm? r rigtt, is bttolk The nil The con ced hr I is mite, ndisati s, istokj miles tol iles on I edlOOpi bank of I iff it, Hi taking the Jamal Bariz drainage, while at 8*78 and 8*85 more deep nullahs join the main channel on this side. The scattered village of Baideran, with the first palms yet seen, is first noted at 8’95 miles, about 400 yards to our left, and continues down that side till 10'60 miles, the whole ground being under cul tivation. From this point, the fort of Bam bears 90° and our road 95°. Streams and marshy ground are now crossed, and proceeding down the torrent bed we are opposite the Bam gardens and palm groves at 13’60 miles. The bazaars are reached at 15J miles, and our house at 15f miles. As Bam lies a trifle furth*r north than Deharzeen and as the torrent beds (for there are three) spread over a large tract of country, the line should run from Bam direct to Abarek, and about 4 miles north of Deharzeen. We should require extra length poles to span the torrent bed at Bam, which is 100 yards in width. 0 ied of, 1 j.'j mite dies. { lef; jtlief so® j': jail* S 7-26B.

We have now dropped down to 3,600 feet, and are in the Narsheer (literally, soft), a fertile and well popu lated, albeit a hot, country, where palm and orange trees flourish in the open. In mid-summer, the heat must be somewhat greater than Kashan, resembling that of Kazeroon. It does not, however, appear to be an un healthy place, and by the Persians it is regarded as the sanitarium of Persian Baloochistan. But Bam, though itself hot in summer, is fortunate in having the two cool resorts of Deh Bakri and Murghek in the Jamal Baziz range, lying at a distance of 25 miles to the south, with an approximate altitude of 7,000 feet. The winters are bracing, and during our stay in the place we found the climate most exhiliarating. However, in comparison with the other stations on the line, Bam will probably prove to be somewhat more trying to a European staff. We saw no garden or house in the town that would answer our purpose, but from all accounts the healthiest, and cer tainly the highest, quarter appears to be on the west side, and at a distance of three miles from the town. Here, the Baijat-ecl-Dowleh (the Suleiman Khan of Sir E. Goldsmid) has laid out a garden, buc as he was absent we were unable to get any details regarding it. I do not think we should experience any difficulty in procuring a piece of ground on this side of the town, on which we could build a suitable office and quarters. We were occupying a house of four small rooms, a kitchen and a store room, which had just changed owners for 4,000 krans. Bam. Cost of Material. Krans. Cent*.

SECTION III, PROM Kerman to Bam. *115 General Summary. Whilst this section does not present the same facilities for the construction of telegraph line as the two sections already dealt with? the engineering diffi culties are not of a very serious character. As we are now traversing a little known country, I propose to touch on the salient points in each stage,''although it may be repeating a good deal of what has already been given under the head of “ description of track followed.” Making a start from the Baghistan or Zere-s gardens of Kerman on the 19th November, we followed the caravan road to the large village of Malum, lying at the foot of the Jupar range, at a distance of 19-92 miles, due south east of Kerman, where we halted for a day in S. fl. the Firman Firma’s beauti ful garden. The road, though -omewhat sandy and h mvy at times, is open to wheeled traffic, and an easy alignment would be ensured by keeping to the north-east side of the valley, which is free of sand drifts. Some anxiety had been entertained as to the best course for the line to follow beyond Mahuu, as wliat is shown as the usual canvan route on the map and in the route book crosses the formidable range of Jupar m matains by tin? narrow Hanaka pass, with an altitude of 8,799 feet, a pass liable to be block A by snow two or three days annually, and at the best of times a very r mgh and undesirable route, only just passable to pack animals. It was, therefore, decided to at first inspect the route mentioned by Capt. Sykes in his despatch to II. B. M/s Minister, dated 22nd September 1898. I am, indeed, glad to be able to state that the result was eminently satisfactory. The new road is taken up at Mahun, and, whilst keeping on the north-east side of the valley in an east-south-easterly direction, it runs parallel to the Hanaka route for some 10 miles, which lies about 4 miles to the south-west at this point. The ascent is very gradual over a sfconv level plain, with an appro ximate width of 9 miles, the Sufah range on the left being 3 miles distant, whilst the Jupar range on the right is some 6 miles off, and, despite so ne stones in places, the road on the whole is fit for wheels. There is no viilag ■ at Zdn-ul- abad, the first station, but the inhabitants of Sagoeh, a village of 140 people, situated 4 miles to the north-north-east, have built two or three mud huts here, and use the good sweet water in irrigating some patches of cultivation. There is also a small orchard. Continuing from Zain-ul-abad, and still ascending an open but ever-nar rowing valley, over a very fair road, we passed the hamlets of Kareemabad 1*35 miles, to the right, and Arababad at 2 70 miles, to the left. We were agreeably surprised to find that the almost imperceptible watershed had been reached at 10-75 miles, and that it proved to be 8,450 feet, or 340 feet less than Hanaka. But this advantage of 340 feet, though in itself of some importance for the safety of a telegraph line, is insignificant when compared with the advantage gained by the general configuration of the ground, which at this point is an absolutely open and gravelly plain, sparsely covered with “ Bo&gt;teh ” or shrub, extending for 3 miles to our left, whilst on our right the ground is also open to ^ the foot of the Kuh-i-Seueh Jevanan, a small hill, ab &gt;ut a mile distant. A gentle descent over gravelly, undulating ground brought us to the mud brick caravanserai of Neybeed at 18'93 miles, where the water was slightly brackish. Having crossed the watershed safely, we anticipated no serious obstacle in the long march from Neybeed to Khan Khatun, ani in this we were not disappointed, as, descending a broad gravelly valley, the road was excellent for the first 4 miles, when it encered a range of low sandstone hills, which in turn gave place to rolling hills at the 10th mile, an l traversing these for the nsxt 11 miles, we finally emerge 1 on to the Klaa-i-Khitu i plan anl reached the village of that name at 23'82 miles. In these rolling hills at the 12th and 13hi miles, respectively, the road crosses two dry shallow torrent beis, about 2 )9 yards wide, draining south into the Tehrud, wiiioh would have to be spin iel at a point higher up, or to the north.116 At Khan-i-Kkatun, the Hanaka-Rayin route is rejoined, and we are pleased to note that a distance of nearly 6 miles has been gained, our cyclometer regis- tcrino 5518 miles from Mahun to Khan Khatun, whereas the route book gives the distance between tlffe same villages as 61 miles. Wemsttw) or thre -3 caravans between Mahun and Neybeed, and the muleteers informed us that this route was a much better one than that vm the Hanaka Pass, which, however, had more supplies and better accommodation, hut that our road was invariably resorted to during the winter months. It is certainly a subject on which Capt. Sykes is to be congratulated m having hit on this route, wnieh dispels the many serious obstacles offered by the lianaka route, which can be fitly compared to the Kohrud. In addition to the advantages already named, we have succeeded in avoiding the source, the many affluents and the main Pehrud river up to this point. ^However, shortly after leaving Kban-i-Khatun, which is the largest of seven small villages in the district known as “Tehrud,” the plain ends, and the road enters the bed of the Tehrud at 1*75 miles, and follows its course till 3 40 miles, when we again, emerge on to a small plain and take a south-easterly direction, while the river flows to the south, or right. At the time of our crossing it, the Tehrud was but a stream ten feet by one. When in flood, it must practically occupy the whole of the defile or gorge, extending from T75 to 3*40 miles, and is about a mile to 2,000 yards broad. When the Tehrud is in flood, apparently an annual contingency, it is impassable at this p )int, and travellers make a slight detour, skirting the Tehrud hills on tlie left, or north-east bank, where there is a bridle path. The hills on this side are of rock, hut those on the left bank more resemble clay cliffs, and are terribly intersected and cut up by water-courses. The line would therefore follow the left bank and be kept well up the hill side. Several small torrent beds, taking the drainage from the precipitous Tehrud hills into the Tehrud river, would have to be spanned. The total distance of this bad part is under ‘2 miles, yet, in my opinion, it is the worst tract of country between Kashan and Regan, and the greatest care and patience will have to be exercised in selecting a safe alignment. \t Avark or Abarek, we found a new mud caravan- Kcrai, known as the caravanserai sarteep, and about a mile and a half from the village, where we had no difficulty in getting a few supplies. At the stage referred to above, we were ou the western edge of a very large gravelly stony plain, 35 to 40 miles wide, bounded by the Jemal Bariz range on the right and the Kuh Kaput on the left, with not a village or a hut in tervening, while straight in front the lofty snow-capped Bazman looms in the distance, probably 140 miles to the east-south-east. This march is an unsatisfactory one, as the r &gt;ai either crosses, follows or skirts the many dry channels of the Tehrud, and is rough and stony, whilst the glare is very trying to the eyes. At the 10th mile, we cross a branch of the dry bed of the Tehrud, and at 13 miles the main bed is traversed, the whole of this distance being in the flood limit. Owing to the absolutely level nature of the surrounding country, the bed of this winter torrent is very badly defined. It has no depth, and consequently no banks, and can only be traced by the tamarisk bush.es that grow in the flood limit. During flood, it is not con fined to any particular channel, but spreads over the plain in many small rivulets, covering a tract of country a mile wide. The road runs through these, and even at its worst time the river is said to be always passable. To avoid this obstacle with its numerous channels, the line should be deflected to the left or north-east, nursing the Kaput hills, and, instead of entering the village of Deharzeen, should leave that village 4 or 5 miles to the right, or south-west, and, skirting the small hamlet of Bugh-i-Chemak, should run straight into Bam, where the torrent bed would be easily spanned . The march from Dcharzeen to Bam was interesting in many ways. The pcevious day’s rain hid made the weather delightfully cool, and had given the117 Jamal Bareez their winter coat. It seemed incredible that we were approach- , 0t r ^ i n g a place so hot that palms and orange trees flourished in the open. The first glimpse of Bam, with its famous fort rising 200 feet above the town, its palms, cypress and orange trees, its numerous gardens, among which 5 the scattered buildings were scarcely visible, was picturesque, and presented a strong % Hi % contrast to the highlands we had just quitted, and reminded one somewhat o^ m i an Indian village. i t j The Moez-ed-Dowleh, the Governor of Bam, and brother of Asaf-ed-Dowleh, tarn® |jj Governor-General of Kerman and Baloochistan, accorded us a very friendly fijiiaii welcome, and placed a house at our disposal in the town. Visits were exchang ed with the principal Khans, among whom was the Asad-ed-Dowleh, who has several times been Governor of Persian Baloochistan and who recognised the ticceelei it cyclometer I had with me as the same that Sir O. St. John had brought up to tli through. Both the above-mentioned officer and Sir JT, Goldsmid were spoken el ari . es i i io terms of great respect by them all. ms, aoltti rse till J| | utbeasteilf ten feet ti file or ^ lards U s impass# ud hills k ills oa ti The commissariat question will first come into prominence on this section, as there are no supplies procurable at Zain-ul-abad or Neybeed. Arrange ments will therefore have to be made to forward the requisite amount from Mahun and to store it at the above-mentioned places. I would point out that the total distance from Mahun to Bam—two large towns, were practically unlimit ed supplies are procurable—is only 95 miles, so that even if we failed to get anything at the villages rowfe, we should only have a maximum of 47 50 miles intervening to one of the above depdts.A' DESCRIPTION or the TRACK OF THE PROPOSED ROUTE OF The Central Persia Telegraph Line.

Starting from the house placed at our disposal by the Governor, which was near the centre of Bam, we at first went through bazaars and streets, and at *46 miles struck the Tehrud bed. Keeping down this for a quarter of a mile, the road hears east-south-east and leaves the bed to the left at '83, wTierethe lanes and houses end on the right, while an Imam Zadeh, or shrine, is registered at the first mile, 100 yards to the left, and Bam may be said to end here. Oar road continues gradually descend ing over a gravelly plain, and the second mile is registered near the Chehal Koreh ruins. The end of the third mile brings us to a cutting in the road, and a short sharp descent is made to a stream of sweet water, which is crossed at 4-06. This stream*flows down to the large and flourishing village of Bora, which extends on both sides of the road from 4’16 to 4*88 miles. We have been veering towards the east, and the road is perfect now, while at 1*88 miles a large stream of sweet water, whose banks are fringed with willows, pampas, palms, and tamarisk, is first seen 50 yards to our right. This stream accompanies us practically throughout the march, the trees stopping at the 16th mile and the brook crossing to our left at the 17th mile. We halt on its hank, a mile short of Yakeelahad. The road throughout was excellent, being a scarcely perceptible descent, over a gravelly to sandy plain. There would be an absolute straight and uniform run of 15 miles here—a perfect stretch.

The small mud hamlets of Chehel Tukhm, Khargoshabad, Sharkabad, and Bustomahad from one-fourth to one mile to the left and Kassimabad, Mohommedabad and Hosseinabad on the right are passed between the 2nd and 5th miles. At 5 52 miles, the jungle ceases, and we traverse an open gravelly plain and cross a marshv stream by a good burnt brick bridge of 11 arches, 8 feet broad, and in good repair at 6'il miles. On the right bank of this stream is Azeezabad, a small village with a lot of cultivation. A stream of sweet water is crossed at 6 - 76 miles,°and here the ground on both sides of the road is under cultivation— principally wheat. A narrow deep nullah, with a small stream in it, is crossed at 6-98 miles. A second hamlet, named Azeezahad, is passed through at 8*23 b 7—31122 miles, and the track suddenly bears due south here, through low jungle, in the direction of Arjeman, which we reach at 10 676 miles. Clearing Arjeman and the strip of jungle contiguous to it, the bearing is again east-south-east, over an open gravelly plain. The villages of Ahmedabad, Deh Nao and Abdulabad are consecutively noted some 600 yards to the right at the llth, 12th and 13th miles, while Chakee, 400 yards to the left, is seen at 15-75 miles, and Turkabad lies on the right at 16-64 miles. After passing some cultivation and a strip of low jungle, the road crosses an open plain towards Bourj Agha Mohommed, which can be seen some 2 miles ahead. The mill of Bourj Agha* Mohommed we leave on the right at 19'45 miles, and the village is reached a few yards further on. Owing to the jungle, the track is not sufficiently broad for wheels, but it could very easily be made so. The country is flat and easy. Bourj Agha Mohommed to Began. Date. No. of March. Route.

Just before this open space, viz., at 1'05 miles, we passed the Bourj or tower of Konder, which formed a splendid land-mark. The plain lasted till 6'74 miles, when the low jungle and scrub again started, being at times very dense and at others more open. Continuing through this, we reached a bifurcation of the road at 9-11, the right path leading to liosseinabad, while we kept straight on. To our left, some 3 miles distant, the village of Aliabad could be seen at 9‘915, and on the same side, also about 3 miles off, some peculiar shaped sand drifts were passed at 10'945. A stream of sweet Water was crossed flowing north east at 11-95, and at 13*18 a second stream, with a brick kiln, lay to our im mediate left, while yet another stream crossed our path at 14*63 miles, and the ground was under cultivation. The first glimpse of the Began fort was obtained at the 15th mile, and, keeping round the west side, we camped near a stream of good water, close to the town. In such places as there was no jungle, the road was excellent; but in the jungle, owing to the trees and under growth, mere bridle paths prevail. A few axes would soon make the road passable to wheel traffic. Water is plentiful, villages are seen in every direc tion, where supplies are procurable, and there is an abundance of fuel.■33 ■er of M B.

The soil is very rich.c. SITES fob TELEGRAPH OFFICES ON THE PROPOSED ROUTE tor The Central Persia Telegraph Line SECTION IV, Bam to Regan.Telegraph Offices. Tbe low altitude of Regan (2,290 feet), and its situation in the middle of a jungle, makes it a very hot and unhealthy place, and by no means a desirable spo' for the location of a Telegraph Office. We must, therefore, instead of taking up the actual sequence of the forward journey hence to Khash, Ladis, Malik Seah Kuh, and Siestan, which is reported on as “ unsuitable routes.” presume that my recommendation, that the line should go from Regan to Rahra via Bazman village, will be adopted, and consider it as the next forward section. TVom Bam to Regan is only 53 11 miles and from Regan to Bazman village 111*16, making a total of 16t 27 miles. The route in the first portion runs through a favourite grazing ground for camels, and the line would traverse a comparatively speaking thickly populated and well cultivated dis trict. The second section of 111J miles, on the contrary, is only inhabited at times by nomad Baloochies, and, for the greater part of the year, is practically deserted, so that little or no damage would be done to the line here. Regan may in the future be an important centre, but its present status does not warrant the institution of a Telegraph Office. I am therefore of opinion that it would suffice if we had a line-guard’s hut here, and entertained, say, three Jurnbaz sowar* or camelry, two for the Bazman and one for the Bam side, to oatrol the line systematically. We have therefore no Telegraph Office to build between Bam and Regan, and the situation of the next station B ill fall in the Y Section.i - GENERAL SUMMARY OE THE PROPOSED ROUTE FOR The Central Persia Telegraph Line SECTION IV, Bam to Regan.General Summart. To the majority of travellers in Persia, the country from Bam to Regan would prove a novelty, while to those with Indian experience a striking re semblance would be found to the tf districts ” of our Eastern Empire. It is no longer the monotonous, barren plain, so often met with in Persia, hut a green, thickly wooded, rich, fertile, and well-populated tract of country that is traversed. Cultivated ground appears on all sides with a superabundance of water, hut when one sees the primitive methods adopted in cultivating, and the constant fear the people have that too lucrative a harvest will probably mean an enhanced rent, one cannot but think how very different the result would be were this tract of rich soil in other hands. To take the stages separately, it would be difficult to find a country more ideally suitable for a telegraph line than the 18 miles from Bam to Yakeelabad. Gradually descending over a fine gravelly plain, the traveller is accompanied throughout the march by a large stream of sweet clear water, whose banks are fringed with willows and young palms, tamarisk and tall grass. Yakeelabad is on the verge of the low jungle of Nermasher, a jungle of mimosa and wild plum, where the tamarisk is no longer a bush but a fine tree of gray-green foliage—a rest for one’s eyes, and here, too, numerous francolin find excellent cover in the thick undergrowrh, the tout ensemble reminding one strongly of the wooded districts of Sind. The road through this jungle is a mere track, turn ing and twisting in every direction, passing many little hamlets, with their adjacent cultivation, and at times traversing a natural clearing of hard gravelly soil. Sweet water is everywhere abundant, and supplies in limited quantities can be procured at almost all of the many villages passed en route. Whilst Vakeelabad occupies the western edge of the jungle just described, Regan may be said to lie on the eastern extremity. I was disappointed in Regan, which I hoped would be a town something like Bam, instead of only possessing some 100 houses —a mere village, in fact; but the chief of many other hamlets clustered all around, the whole district boasting of some hundreds of kanats of sweet water and a rich produce. Two days were spent in Regan in purchasing running camels for our servants, in replenishing our forage for the 10 desert stages to Khasb, and in procuring guides and an escortA.

Taking a south-easterly direction, the track goes through some low jungle of mimosa and tamarisk, crossing a stream of sweet water at *50 miles and passing a mosque of sun-dried brick 50 yards to the left. A Ziaret or shrine is seen at 1’bO miles close to the right, and we here turn a few points to the south. Skirting a patch of cultivation at 2’26 and crossing a stream at 2 , 43, we descend at 2 60 to a ravine through which flows a good-sized stream of water, working, 100 yards higher up, the Rahmatabad mill. Kaleh Sultanabad, a new walled village, with castellated corner towers, is now seen bearing 140°, and we leave it to our immediate left at 3'56, and can see G-azan Khas a mile to our right. Shortly after this, we change our direction to 113°, which is practically main tained throughout the march. Crossing a stream at 4*65 miles, we make a slight descent and get to the end of the jungle at 5T0 miles, when we emerge on to a sandy plain. This sand, however, ceases at 5 GO, and the going is good now throughout. We reach the Malik Chah river bed at 6*30 miles, and it had in it about a foot of water. The 3 or 4 channels had a width of about 15 yards. The Konarnai was reached at G’SS, and stopped at 6 , 62. This width, so far as I could make out, was the flood limit. When we crossed, there was a stream 25 feet by 1, and this after 4 days’ excessive rain. Continu ing over a gravelly sandy open plain covered with tumuli, and good camel grazing on all sides, we reach a strip of tamarisk at 9'50 miles, which stopped at 11 miles. Here we emerge on to a hard plain, and, passing a few mimosa trees at HAG, were at Chah Malik. The jungle would have to be cleared to make this road passable to wheels. Chah Malar to Nookabad. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Milas. Total Miles. oli IS y 14th February 1899 ... 2 Nookabad, 2,475 feet. 11-83 23*44 We took a bearing of 72° on leaving camp Chah Malik to join the main road, which we had left in order to reach the wells. Tor the first mile and a half, we traversed a gravelly plain, and at 1*40 miles struck the first of ^ the many small channels of a winter torrent. My guides would not have this as the Konarnai (Jenning’s), and stated that we had left the Konar yesterday. The little and many ramifications of this nameless torrent are finally cleared at 2'60 miles. In this strip of over a mile, there is an abundant growth of tama risk, and excellent grazing for camels. We emerge from the tamarisks on to the stony plain at 2-60 miles, and now observe our forward bearing to be 160 , while Deh Yagi Khan, a village 15 miles east of Regan, at which we halted on i 7-~J5138 our way to Khask, is seen bearing 11°. We join the main road at 6 miles, which is quite a well defined track. With 111° as our bearing, we gradually ascend a stony barren plain, with a few undulations at times. We cross a nullah from 8*15 to 8’55 and a second at 9'25. In the latter, there is a rich growth of tamarisk, with reeds and grazing and some springs of very brackish water. We have been travelling in the direction of a small oblong, flat-topped, hill and reach it at 9‘70 miles, leaving it 50 yards to our left. This Tall is known as Ali Bargird, and tradition has it that the Prophet Ali came to this hill and from its summit was shown and offered Bam and Narmashir, which he refused. At 10*10 miles, the “ Mazur,’’ a line of stones covering an acre, in a rectangular shape, is shown as the deviation from the road Ali made at this place. Here, too, a road joins in on the left from Deh Yagi Khan, which bears 337°. At 10*40 miles, we pass through a strip of tamarisk and good grazing. Prom the “ Mazar,” a single tall Kahur (minosat tree is seen hearing 117°, which marks the Nbokabad wells, our halting place. At 11*50, we go over soft salty ground and camp at the tree. Bond good and open to wheels ; regu lar spans ; few angles. Nookabad to Ramkak. Bate. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. o^; 15th February 1899 ... 3 Ramkan, 2,950 feet ... 17-70 41-14 The road bifurcates at Nookabad, the right track, hearing 136°, going towards Gegan on the main Regan-Bampur route, while we take the left, with 115° as our line, and at *40 of a mile pass the Tai-i-Nookabad, some 150 yards to our left. The Nookabad plain ends at 1*57 miles, where we cross a low ridge and get into undulating ground. A wet salty and sandy depression is traversed at 195 miles. It is only 90 to 100 yards wide, and could, if necessary, be avoided by a slight detour to the right, south-south-west. There is some very brackish water here; also a few tamarisks. At the end of the second mile, we emerge on to a large plain, which we traverse with 130° as our bearing. This plain is of a sandy gravelly soil, and is luxuriant in camel grazing. At 5*60, we note some tamarisks to our right, about 400 yards off, while at 6 10 miles a small conical volcanic-looking hill is passed, 200 yards to our right. 7'90 miles brings us to the end of the plain, and the track now leads over slightly undulating ground and across a plateau till 10 miles is reached, when we again enter on a large plain. This, like its predecessor, is covered with good camel grazing, but from 11*55 to 12*70 miles it is strewn with a cindery kind ol stone of a red, black and gray colour. The wheel registers lo 40 miles opposite a small hill one-fourth of a mile on our right, and we here take a bearing of 151° to Ramkan springs. We might have con tinued in our former bearing, 122°, which is the hearing of the direct road, hut tne well at 14 40 miles was said to be dry. Continuing over a sandy plain, we struck the dry channel of the Ramkan (Zahu) steam at 14*60 miles, and continued up its solt gravelly bed till 15*30. This river seldom has water in it. The Hood limit is /5 yards broad, with no depth. A thick copse of tama risk was passed at 16 miles close to our right, which was said to be used as sheep-pens in the summer months. Wb have been in a valley some 4 miles v ide for the last 2 miles, with a rango of low hills on the right, 3 miles off, and disconnected hills on the left. The peculiar red conical hill of Ramkan lies about 1 mile off, bearing 55°. We camp at 17f miles on the right bank of an affluent of the Ramkan nullah. The track was good throughout, and carts could easily traverse it.139 Kam Kan to Chah Gez. Date No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles, Total Miles. 16th February 1899 ... 4 Chah Gez, 3,910 feet. 17*85 58*99 Q We had to make our way across to the main track, so, taking a bearing of 100 , we passed through some low disconnected hills and at 2 miles emerged on to a small valley, whence we went due north-east, till we struck the road at 3h&gt;0 miles. At this point, we had a clear view of the track of to-day’s march, and practically adhered to a bearing of 101°. The path here hugs the southern base of the peculiar red conical hill already referred to, which' I take to he Ramkan—-but the guide calls it Kuh Za—and gradually descends on to a large open plain. At first, the going is excellent; it is then somewhat stony till the drainage channel is entered at 475 miles, where it becomes sandy till the 5th mile, when it is again cohered with loose stones till 6‘40 miles. We now gra dually traverse a large gravelly plain with excellent camel grazing, at the same time ascending, the going being very good, till tiie i4th mile, when stones again prevail. _ I ought to have mentioned that at the 8th mile we passed Kuh Za (2), 1 mile to our left. At 15'80 miles, the plain practically ends and we go along a plateau or tablelancl, about a mile wide, with very low hills on the right and raised ground on the left. The first Qvz or tamarisks seen en route are passed at 16 35 miles, a few yards to our right, while a second lot is noted at 16*71, also close to our right, and a large cluster at 16*90 miles to our left. The bearing of the well from this point is 110°, and we cross a nullah at 17 miles to reach some high stony ground at 17 50. The halting place itself is a quarter of a mile further on. Tin whole country to-day is ideally suitable for a line, and an excellent road would be ensured by removing the loose surface stones, which are small, while the ground beneath is firm and gravelly. Chah Gez to Henjareh. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 17th February 1899 ... 5 Henjareh, 4,220 feet... 10*90 69*89 Leaving camp at Chah Gez, we took a hearing of 98° and continued gradually ascending over somewhat stony undulating ground, which was never theless well covered with camel-thorn and other herbage, and at 3*15 miles we crossed a small nullah draining north into the Ghah Reis plain. Gorandoo Kuh was passed Jth mile to our left at 4*25 miles. The plateau we had been traversing was gradually contracting, and at this point was little over a mile in width, while at 4*70 miles we were among low sandstone disconnected hills. At 5 miles, a track branches off to Samsoor, bearing 45°, and my subsequent notes show that the line will have to follow this track to avoid some rough ground encountered on our route at 6*70 and 10*20 miles. We took up our yesterday’s hearing of 111 0 at the 5th mile, and at 6*70 miles had to trend our way140 throuali a narrow and rougliish, though very short, defile to reach a watershed at 6-75 miles, which was 4,000 feet. We now emerge on to a small gravelly plain-plateau, with good grazing, which proved to be a mile long, as we again entered low small sand stone hills at 7’85 miles. The second plain ends at 9’25 miles, and at this point three-fourths of a mile to the light, bearing 183 , is a spring of good sweet water, known as Henjerook. W e continued over un dulating ground round the northern base of the Henjareh Kuh, and at 10 miles the track became very stony, rocky and rough; in fact, barely passable to artillery. However, the hills on our left only extend for a mile, when the plain is reached, and by following the Samsoor road, which was noted at the 5th mile, this short bad piece can be avoided. The Henjareh spring is at the edge o the hills. The actual track followed, which enters the Henjareh hills, is not pass able to wheels for about 2 miles, and a slight detour on to the plain would have to be made as recommended above, where the road would be passable to wheels. Henjareh to Pansara. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. fi ^Lo*si 18th February 1899 ... 6 Pansara, 4,240 feet ... 25*39 95*28 After a gentle descent of half a mile over rough, stony undulating ground, we reached the plain, and took an east-south-easterly direction towards some rocky hills. The plain was stony, but a fair road could easily be made over it. At the 3rd mile, we were going between large rocky mountains, which the guide named Gerantarash, following a valley about half a mile wide, which was very rough. At this point, we turned more to the east and emerged on to the large valley which lies between the Seah Band range on the east and the Bazman Kuh on the west ? and at 5*70 miles the low hills stopped on both sides. At the 9th mile, the plain was strewn with very large stones and a mere path wended among these till 10*70 miles, when the stones almost ceased, giving place to gravel. This, however, did not last long, as stones were again encountered at the 14th mile, and continued for 2 miles, when there was a short clear space. We had been veering round to the south again, and our bearing at the 16th mile was 160°. From the 17th mile to the 21st mile, the going was very rough with a few deep narrow nullahs and huge boulders, and I should say impassable to wheels. My escort men told me that the road from Har-i-Ahu to Dar-i-Kashgin on the main route, a distance of 50 odd miles, was much worse than this piece, and yet artillery has traversed it! This route has very few torrent beds, while the other has a great many. At 18*50 miles, a white spot, bearing 110° and known as Safee Awa, said to possess sweet water springs, is seen on the opposite side of the valley. The stones end at 20*75, and we have a clear space to 22*80. The Pansara hills begin on the right at 24*40 miles, and we now turn due south-east towards Pansara, which is practically surrounded by low hills, off-shoots of Bazman. The last mile into Pansara is again very rough, over boulders and in a deep nullah. We camped on a clear space 40 yards by 40 yards, the distance being 25^ miles. This is the only rough stage from Began so far, and though there are stones and boulders, the road is practically over a plain, and is therefore level, and could be made good and fit for wheels. Besides, by keeping, say 2 miles, to the left, down the centre of the valley, a gravelly road without stones could be found.141 P ANSAR A TO BAZMAN. a ''iteiik Slna11 H ^ a Hea!|! i ^ariti» | Utted ov^n ^datlO||| J passal \ ^eatlefli ^ ol ml; edge o! | ! &gt; is not pj, 3 plaio ?nj oepasa::; | ediate Tti es.

The hills were receding somewhat, and we changed our bearing to south-west crossing a second insignificant watershed at 2*35 miles. The gSing was now Very rough mOes r W V ente + r T ed ^e large gravelly bed of the Zehan Pood at 4°50 s. We continued m the dry bed of this torrent for 2 miles, and though at first gravelly, towards the end the bed was very rough. The banks of this nullah are at times steep—lfi feet high—and at others nearly level with the suiroundmg country, which, it will be gathered, is undulating and stonv. The hills are easy. We now take a bearing of 250°, and ascend the Gwan nullah for f nidos, leacmg it m turn at 8’40 miles to ascend a small but stiff, rocky, torrent bed to the watershed at 9‘15 miles; 3,800 feet. This watershed appears to me to divide the north and south drainage. We had a short spell of good goin- on le open watershed of half a mile, when we entered the Kisht nullah and followed this, with a bearing of Wo for the next 4*35 miles-a very rough nullah, with huge boulders very bad going, indeed, and quite impassable to wheels, Vhere no track was discernable and where we found it hard work to wheel the cyelo- meter ihe country on either bank of the Kisht is undulating and very rou-h ;Y] pfrV’ if n ^ V f 7 i 8 a 1 bo V fc half a mile wide ’ of which nullah takes up half. On the whole, I think the right bank is the better. In any case, there is no real difficulty for the construction of a line, but a road would have to be made. It reminded me of the Tang-i-Turkan between Kazeroon and ift°p aa / r f k 1 , teh ’ . 1 Afc l 5 ' 10 miIes ’ we left the torrent bed and took a hearing of i Vf or half a mile, when we changed to 230° and encamped on the extreme ieit hand corner of the palm trees of Bazman. The last mile was over fair going and sandstone. A day’s halt at Bazman enabled me to find a much better route for the line, so that the above will not be followed. Bazman to Camp. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 21st February 1899 8 Camp, 2,320 feet 20-90 132-06 Taking a bearing of 143°, we descended a narrow valley over the Bazman fallow ground with low hills on our left, while to our right is a piece of marshy and, which ends at ‘75 miles. The track crosses a small narrow nullah at mile and thence passes through coarse grass and Peesh, with a rocky hill ying close to our right, at 1*20 miles. We now traverse some rocky ground and a stony plain till 2^ miles, when we turn due south and enter the bed of e Shur nullah at 2'90 miles. Down the bed of this nullah, which had pools * 1 —36of water in it, the going over boulders and stones was very rough, and we were not sorry to leave it at 5 miles, at which point the Rood-Khaneh (perennial) Kahur joins in on the right bank. A. short steep ascent brings us on to a small stony plateau, and we continue over this with the river on our right till 0 L miles, when we just touch the bed again for a few yards and then strike across a stony plateau with 150° as our bearing. The track over the plateau is stony, but good. At 8 miles, 2 cairns, known as Cheeda, are passed, and at 10-80 miles a small nameless nullah is crossed. The plateau ends at 12} miles in a depression known as the Konar Basteii. The total width of this depression is from 12 70 to 13 33 miles, but the right hand bank from 12*70 to 13-33 is much higher (6 feet) than the left side, which extends from 13 13 to 13’33 and is the real channel and flood limit of all the torrents (Zahan, etc.) draining to the south-east of Bazman. The left bank is 15 feet high and the /right bank 5 feet, and the former, being sandy, is apt to be washed away and after rains become precipitous. Emerging from the Konar Basteh nullah, we were again on the great plain which runs between Bazman Kuh on the west and the Seah Band Kuh on the east, and continue over sandy to gravelly soil, the going being very good. At 14*60, a small narrow nullah is crossed, draining, like all the others, south-south-west. Two cairns of stones, known as Cheeda Mollah Nusheed, lie close to the road at 15*70 miles, while the dry wells of Chah Lambeed are passed at 17*85, and about 100 yards further on is Daul Hasanat, 3 Kahur frees. A straight run brings us to our camp in the plain. Mandran, mentioned in the route book, was not known to my guide, but Parrek bears 28° and Dar-i-Kammer 100°.

J 22nd Pebruary 1899 ... 9 Bampur, 1,920 feet. 30-37 162-43 Prom our halting place in the open plain, we gradually ascend in a south easterly direction towards a range of low hills, an off-shoot of the Seah Band, which seem to suddenly stop here. A track from Grezak joins in at 6*50 miles, and at the 7 th mile the road bifurcates, that to the right, or south-east, leading to Bampur, while the left, or easterly one, goes to Pahra via the Kaskin spring. The road is now rough, while the surrounding country is broken up, and we traverse undulating ground to the banks of the Kaskin torrent bed, which is reached at 9'90 miles and which is again left at 10-05 miles. The actual channel only covers some 40 to 50 yards, has steep firm banks, and can easily be spanned here. A road from the Kaskin spring joins in on our left at 10'90 miles. Continuing in a south-easterly direction and skirting the hills, the track is good over gravelly soil till 13'60 miles, when it again enters some undulating ground, which might be termed very low hills. A few yards further on, 13‘80, the Dab Gezan spring is seen bearing 120°. There is perennial slightly brackish water here, and a few tamarisk bushes were also seen. The road now swings more to south of south-east and we cross a number of small dry channels be tween 14 and 14-45 miles, which are known as the Dabgezan Nullah. They are quite insignificant. Cheda Reis, a cairn of stones, is passed at 16'25 miles, and from this point our forward bearing is 178°, while the Bampur fort can be seen bearing 175°. We have now reached the highest point, 2,500 feet, of the obliquely sloping plain, and a gradual descent is made into Bampur. A track to Koochgardan, on the main road from Regan to Bampur, branches off at 18-80 miles. At 19’10, a cairn of stones, known as Cheda Jalan, is passed on the right,while half a mile further on two mimosa trees, known as Kaheer Dual Jalan, he close to the left. ^ A hot trying descent over gravelly soil brings us to the leyei, bare pat plain at 26’50 miles. Crossing this^, we get into low sand urilts and. sand,^ with its attendant mimosa and tamarisk. The Bamnur fort is distant to our right about half a mile, and we cross the road leading from it to rahra at 30 miles, while at 30J miles we camp on the bank of a stream of sweet water and half a mile to the south-east of Bampur and its fort, which bears 309 . The line will not come to Bampur, but will go direct to Pahra. The following names of springs and distances on the direct Bazman-Pahra route were given to me :— Bazman to— Kahurkan Parrek Kaskin Dabgezan Tramp Bazmanee ...

The road from Bampur, the old, to Pahra, the new, capital and seat of government, is good and fit for wheels throughout. Shortly after leaving Bampur, P50 miles, the road bifurcates. The left, or north one, being more direct and skirting the sand hills, is barren, whereas the right, or south one, keeps in the jungle and close to the river with its cultivation. Nasireah and Allahabad are passed in the first 3 miles, lying a short distance to the right. At 5 miles, the river is only 50 yards off (the cultivation having ceased), and after following its right bank through two deep nullahs, or probably canal beds, we reach the Sar-i-Band or dam. The dam is of mud and tree branches, and must require annual repairs and renewal. When I passed, a considerable volume of water was escaping through a breach in the dam, while one large canal, 5 feet by 3, w T as taking down a sufficient supply to irrigate the tillage of 60 pairs of oxen. The country to our left at 11 miles is open and fallow with no trees, while on the right the jungle is also sparse. The road emerges on to open ground at 12‘20 miles, having low sand hills on the left, and from this point the Pahra cara vanserai-like fort bears 70°. The alternative route from Bampur joins in at 13T5 miles. We now continue over a stony gravelly plain towards Pahra, gradually rising, and cross a stream of sweet clear water at 15*37 miles, which a few yards further up drives a mill. Close to the mill, there are several C£ Ketouk ” or palm leaf huts. The rectangular Government building, resem bling a huge caravanserai, is of mud, with walls 12 feet to 15 feet high, and with round towers or bastions in the corners and also in the middle of the walls. The entrance is of burnt (kiln) brick. We encamped near the Yakhtekan* a sort of refrigirator, at 15*65 miles.B. GAZETTEER OF THE PROPOSED ROUTE FOB, The Central Persia Telegraph Line SECTION V, Regan to Pahra.147 Gazetteer. As there are no villages, huts or encampments at several of the halting places on this section, it is needless to submit the gazetteer in the form pre viously used, as we should simply write the word “ Nil ” opposite several of the headings. Ihe following modified form has therefore been adopted. \Wi February 1899. Chah Malik. Height 2,250 feet. Ohah Malik, situated just beyond the eastern verge of the Narmasheer, has a well of perennial sweet water, some 6 feet deep, and also a line of disused Kanats, which if cleared out would doubtless again give a supply of cle;&gt;r water. New wells could also be dug, when water would he struck at 6 or 7 feet. The camel grazing is good, fuel plentiful, and the soil is fair and a-able. The climate is very hot. 14^ February 1899. Nookabad. Height 2,475 feet. Nookabad lies 11J miles east-south-east of Chah Malik and some 8 miles north of Geg in, which is on the main route. It has a well of slightly brackish w r ater, 7 feet deep. Other wells could be dug here, as water is said to exist at the abovementioned depth. The graz ng is fair, and a little fuel is to be found. The soil is soft and salty. The climate is very hot. 15M February 1899. Rai^kak. Height 2,950 feet. To the immediate south of the Kuh Ramkan, in a nullah, the tvell of that name is Heated. It is 7 feet deep, and the water is plentiful and practically sweet. The camel grazing is excellent and fuel is plentiful, while the ground is very fair for cultivation. The climate would be somewhat cooler than the two previous mentioned places. This would be a likely place for a small Tana of stone and mud, which would cost about Rs. 200. 16^ February 1899. Chah Gez. Height 3,910 feet. * Temp.—6 a.m., 51° ; 6 p. m., 60°. Chah Gez lies to the north-west of the Bazman Kuh and has a spring of slightly brackish water, which tlow&gt; into a well. There is good camel grazing, and a fair amount of fuel is procurable. The soil is decidedly good. Chah Gez has a fair climate. * iVote.—Captain Webb-Ware kindly sent me a thermometer, so the temperature is again given. 17^ February 1899, Henjareh. Height 4,220 feet.

The carrel grazing in the plain is excellent. Fuel, too, is procurable. There is no arable ground at Henjareh, but a mile off the plain is reached, which has fair soil. A small Tana might also be built here at a cost of Rs. 200. 18^ February 1899. Pansara. Height 4,240 feet.

With an altitude of only 1,920 feet, situated in a hollow among damp, marshy ground, with the river flowing through, Bampur is very liable to sudden changes in temperature, and is a very feverish and most unhealthy place. It is a bye word for heat and unhealthiness even in Balooehistan. When I said Kej was hotter, I was met with a rejoinder— £t Perhaps, but Bampur is uu- healthier.’’ The heat during summer is said to be terrific. During the 4 days I was there, February 2:2nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, the temperature varied between 58° to 86° at 1 p.m., wfith a sultry atmosphere, which gives one a suffocating sensation, and had a most depressing effect, ! and this was at the end of the winter. To translate the 1 Deputy Governor’s words, it was a veritable hell, and life became an existence during July and August, when, he declared, eggs, placed in the sun, were cooked in a few minutes ! He said there was no difference between Pahra and Bampur as regards climate, but that the river water at the latter place was preferable to the Kanat water at Pahra. The Persians find it a most deadly climate. During the past 4 years, close on 100 of the 400 soldiers have died of the effects of heat. As another instance of the notoriously bad climate of Bampur, I may state that 7 years ago the late Firman Firma sent down 300 masons from Kerman to build the Pahra fort, of which number 80 died at Pahra, [ while some 25 died en route on the homeward journey. {^Bampur consists of two classes—the poor, unfortunate, down trodden Baloochies of Negroid extraction, who are the slaves of the Persian Government officials, and of the domineering Persian soldiery. The latter lead j a lazy life and live on the produce of the former. The Baloochies complained bitterly to me of their hard lot, and how depopulated and poor the whole district ... •{ had become. The half of the Barapur river water is running to waste because there are no labourers to till the soil. I personally saw the Persian soldiers hunting some Baloochies who were eating the green barley about 1 foot high. The Baloochies say the country is ruined, and pray for us to come and take it.

SECTION V, Regan to Pahra.153 Seventh Control Station— Bazman. TELEGRAPH OFFICES. BAZMAN. 19^ February 1899, Temp.—6 a. m. t 61; 1 p. m., 72; 6 p. m., 63. In the selection of the most suitable places at which to locate Telegraph Offices on the preceding sections, we have been greatly assisted by the relative position of the important towns to each other, to their possessing a good climate, and to the fact of our traversing an in habited and fertile tract of country. From Began to Pahra, however, the antithesis is the case, as on the main routes between these towns there is not a village, the road crossing a desert. It was for this reason that the heretofore little known route to Pahra via Henjareh and Bazman was followed. In another place (General Summary), I have dealt with the superior advantages this route possesses over all the other routes for the con struction and subsequent maintenance of a telegraph line, hut in addition to other advantages we have in the Bazman village a more suitable—in fact, the only possible—place at which to locate a Telegraph Office between Bam and Pahra, a distance of 230 , 97 miles. Bazman village, situated on the south-west slopes of the great cone-shaped mountain of that name, which rises to some 12,000 feet and is capped with perennial snow', has an altitude of 3,598 feet, with camping grounds on the mountain at 6,000 feet. The winters are bracing, and although snow does not actually fall at the village, the surrounding hills are annually covered, w r hile spring and autumn are said to he comparatively cool, and the summer heat is not excessive. It has already been pointed out that Began is not a fit spot for a Telegraph Office, and by reading the description given of the climate of Bampur and Pahra in the Gazetteer it will be seen that these places are even more unsuitable. It would appear that we have only to remember that, at those places in the interior of Persia which have an altitude of under 3,000 feet, the climate proves a trying one for Europeans, to condemn Bampur and Pahra. I need not therefore dilate further on the subject of climate here, and on the inadvisability of establishing a European staff at either of the abovementioned towns. Looking at the safety of Bazman as compared with that of Bampur in case of a Baloochi rising, past experience tends to prove that Bampur has on more than one occasion been besieged by the Baloochies, while Bazman has never yet been attacked. Only last year, Sirdar Hossein Khan, the Balooch Chief, surrounded Bampur with an estimated force of 4,000 and besieged the fort for 4 months, during which 65 Baloochi«s and 9 Persian soldiers were killed. The Sirdar is now an outlaw in the mountains near Sarbaz, and from what I could gather he not only still has a considerable following with him, but is trying to ferment and incite the Baloochies of southern Persian-Baloochistan to in surrection. b 7—39154 As to the cost of building an office at the respective placei referred to, the operation would prove a verj expensive one at Bampur, as the price of kiln burnt bricks is very- high (160 Krans per 1,000). There are several reason* for this:— (1) Masons have to be brought from Kerman. (2) Earth suitable for bricks has to be transported from a distance. (3) Water has either to be carried from the river to the site of the buildings, some 2 miles, or a canal has to be dug. (4) There is no timber suitable for building. At Bazman, (21 (3) (4) disappear and also (1) in part, as maions could be engaged to work at a lower rate of wages in the cooler climes of Bazman than in the un healthy heat of Bampur. The Pahra Government building was stated to have cost 120,000 Krans and the annual repairs amount to 2,500 Krans. 1 was advised to take the Bam rates and to add 50^ for building at Bazman. The question which naturally presents itself at this stage, and one which, though out of place, must be disposed of is— “ Having established a Telegraph Office at Bam with the next one at Bazman, and having condemned Began and Bampur as unsuitable places at which to place a station, where will the next forward station he located ? ” There are two routes from Bampur to Karachi—one through the interior vid Magas Kuhak and Bela; the second vid Serbaz and Peshin down to the coast to Gwadur. I am advocating the adoption of the former, and should my recommendation he accepted, it will at once he seen that the next forward station to Bazman will be Magas, which gives the very suitable distance of 138 odd miles. The Baloochies term Magas “ Sarhad,” which with them means “ cold country,” and from the enquiries I made Magas appears to possess a good cli mate. The altitude of Magas is given as 3,970 feet, while it may be considered quite a large village with an estimated population of 1,000 inhabitants. The water is good, and supplies in fair quantities are procurable, and being, as it were, on the main road and the centre of a fairly rich district, it is visited annually by the Governor of Bam to collect the revenue, and is thus kept under more careful supervision and control than places to the north or »outh of the valley.The objeetions to building a line from Bampur to Gwadur are so numerous that I do not think there is any likeli hood of this route being followed, but it is only right to look to every contingency and compare the position of Bazman with that of the villages on the Pahr,a-Gwadur route. Bask would appear to be the best division of the distance. Bazaman to Bask is 174*47 j Bask to Gwadur 113*54. The altitude of Bask is 1,845 feet, and it is a very hot and unhealthy spot. The temperature on the 6th March was—4 a.m., 72; 1 p.m., 96 ; 6 p.m., 83. It will therefore be seen that, whichever route is finally selected, the location of Bazman fits in with the posi tion of the next forward station.GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED ROUTE FOR The Central Persia Telegraph Line SECTION V, Regan to Pahra. b 7—40159 Gi:neri.l Summary. We have now come to the last, and by far the most arduous, section on the whole line from Ardistan to Pahra. Began may he considered to be the eastern terminal town in consecutive and contiguous communication with western Persia, as it lies on the ver&lt;m of a desert, which roughly speaking, surrounds it on three sides—north, east and south. Whichever route is taken beyond Regan, a portion of this desert must be traversed, and it naturally behoves us to find the route which will give us the minimum amount of desert, and more important still the maximum amount o. good water and supplies, and the best climate—in this case, the hiobest altitude. ° There are four routes from Hegan to Pahra :— (i) Via Geran Reeg, essentially a desert one, traversed by St. John, but now seldom used ; ISS'QS miles. r. (i^^Zahu, which may be termed the King’s highway, traversed by troldsmid and Jennings, and is under-estimated as 174*68 miles. (iii) Via Gegan and Bazman, referred to by Sykes, hut not yet traversed by anyone; 17P70 miles. (iv) Via Henjareh and Bazman, which I am the first European to have traversed; 177*86 miles. To take the routes in the order they are named— (i) This route, being without a village or a hut, and with little water and no supplies, and being also considerably longer and practically obsolete, need not be seriously discussed. (ii) The second route, vid Zahu, runs between the west and south-western slopes of Bazman Kuh and the desert, and as the drainage off that mountain finds its way to the Jaz Morian. Hamun lying to the south-west, the road for miles practically follows or crosses a series of torrent beds and deep nullahs, and is terribly rough and cut up. There are no villages en route at which supplies can be obtained, while the water-supply is meagre and practically brackish throughout, except perhaps at Zahu, which, however, is dependent on the rainfall for its supply, and is by no means perennial! With no water at Zahu, the waterless track from Gegan to Ear Abu would be over 40 miles. At present, this is the main road, and has been followed by successive Governors travelling between Began and Bampur, but when we open up the Bazman route, I am quite certain this rough and rocky road will be abandoned, (iii) The Gegan Bazman route, recommended by Captain Sykes, crosses several rocky hills, off-shoots of Bazman, on the west, and is so narrow and rough in places as to be only just passable to lightly laden animals. It is only used by such as have Bazman village as their destination. (iv) This newly discovered route via Henjareh and Bazman village is in my opinion in every way the most suitable for the line to follow. Although particulars of the track followed and a gazetteer have already been given, it will he necessary to recapitulate, more or less in detail, on this important section. The country from Regan to Pansara is open and well suited for a line, but the 15*88 miles from Pansara to Bazman village lies in the hills, is very rough, crossing several ridges and torrent beds, and is impassable to wheels. I therefore halted a day at Bazman and examined the country to the east, andwas fortunate enough to find an easy route from the village to the valley, which lies 7'85 miles due east. This particular tract of country reminded me of that between Khaneh Kergoon and Morghab on the present mam line. What should therefore be done is, instead of running the line to Pansara hence to Bazmau village, to keep in the valley, which opposite Pansara would be about 6 miles distant, while opposite Bazman it is 7-85 miles off, and a loop- ^ run into Bazman along the track referred to above. The country for the fiis 3 miles beyond Bazman is also somewhat rough and intersected with nu lahs and channels. Thus, bv adopting a loop-line an easy ingress and egress would be insured, and this bad bit eliminated. From the point in the valley at which the loop-line will branch off to Bazman to Bampur is about ol miles, for which distance the main line would run in a south-south-easterly direction alono- an open vallev, but as Pahra lies 15 odd miles due east of Bampur, the line would not enter' the latter place, but would swing round^ some low hills and go direct to Pahra, leaving Bampur 8 or 10 miles to the right, or south. The first advantage this route claims over all the others emanating from Repair is that it has the large village of Bazmm on it, at which supplies can be 'procured. The secon i is that, as it skirts the northern and eastern base of Bazman Kuh along a valley, there are very few and insignificant torrent beds to be crossed, the drainage being to the south-west. ^ The third is that the water-supply is better and more abundant, and is met with at shorter intervals. The fourth is that the average altitude throughout is some 800 to 1,000 feet higher, while at Henjareh a maximum of 4,220 feet is attained. Thus, the three chief difficulties—scarcity of water, scarcity of supplies, and intense heat—which exist on all the trans-Regan routes can best be mini mised by adopting the route recommended by me. Although the places mentioned—Chah Malik, Nookabad, Ramkan, Chah Gez, and Henjareh—at present only mark the site of springs or wells, there is every reason to hope that, by improving and increasing the water-supply, and by placing a line guard at the best places, we should soon have a few huts and small patches of cultivation springing up. There is no sand or desert, to use the strict interpre-- tationof the term, on this route, while the soil in places is good and capable, of yielding fair crops. The camel grazing is for the most part excellent—-a very important factor in a country where camels are the beasts of burden ; and in the valley there was very fair pasturage when we passed. Elaborate arrangements will naturally have to he made to ensure a good and constant supply of water for the large working party and transport animals that will be employed on the construction of the line, and I think that, in the year previous to that in which we hope to build the line on the Regan-Pahra section, a responsible officer with a party of well-diggers, and with the necessary implements, should he deputed to carry out this work. As I consider the whole road from Ardistan to Pahra, with a very little work in a few places, open to wheels, I would recommend the use of zinc water- carts, which I think would be preferable to, and in the long run more econo mical than, water barrels or Persian Ravias or leather water-sacks. Next to the question of the water on this section, that of supplies will he the most important. This would also be greatly simplified if the officer in charge of the water-supply were to build a small Tana of mud and stone at, say, — Ramkan 41'14 miles Henjareh ... ... 28*75 Pansara ... .. 25*39 and purchase half the amount of grain necessary for the working party between Regan and Bazman, at the former place, and store it at the above Tanas. The officer in charge of the construction could purchase the balance in Regan in the following year and take it along with him.I have now come to the conclusion of the report on the route which I propose that the Central Persia Telegraph line should follow, and although I have still to deal with the other routes examined, the disadvantages of which are so great in comparison with the one recommended as to lead me to place them under the category of “ unsuitable routes,” I shall summarise on my pro posal. In a total distance of 793 miles from Kashan to Pahra, there is not a single mountain range or pass to surmount; the two watersheds—the first at Zaferkand, 6,957 feet, and the second at Zain-ed-Deen, 8,450 feet—^-are so open and easy as to be fit for wheeled traffic. Not a single river is met with, while such dry torrent beds as are encountered can be spanned without resorting to masts. Por the greater portion of the distance, the line would run along a valley Wxiich is flat and open, where a uniformity of spans would be main tained, with scarcely any undulating ground, consisting for the most part of a firm fine gravelly soil which would be easily worked. Pock and marshy ground, Kavir, sand drifts, salty efflorescence and other chemicals injurious to iron are avoided, while up to Regan villages, where supplies and sweet water are procurable, are passed at comparatively short intervals. Looking at the map of Persia, and remembering what has been written on the description of the track followed and in the gazetteer of the country traversed, it will be seen that the natural lie of the route recommended, with the great Dasht-i-L it stretching down its northern flank, and with a high mountain chain, with an arid plain beyond, along the southern side, suggests the idea that the only continuous strip of country which can lay any claim to fertility and habitation has been selected I would therefore beg leave to re commend that the Central Persia Telegraph line should start from Kashan and proceed to Yezd along the main Caravan and Chappar road vid Abu Ziidabad, Kalatabad, Moghar, Ardistan, Zaferkaud, Nayes^enak, Nain. Noh Gombaz and Akda, from which p &gt;int the Chapmr road would he left aud a slight detour made vid Pa Gondeh, Ardakau, Kalantar and Kareemabad. Prom Yezd to Kerman, the Chappnr road would be again followed for the first stage to Sard- Yezd, wh nee the line should run vid Gird Kuh and Mehdiabad, and again join the main Post road near Shems and follow it through Anar and Baiyaz. Near Golnabad, a slight detour would again have to be made via Difeh to Balirarn- abad, and leaving Kaboo ar Khan to the right the line would pass through Robat and Baghiu, which are on the main road. Beyond Kerman, the new route would be followed vid Mahun, Zdfin-uL-abad, Neybeed, Khan Khatun, Abarek and Bag-i-Chemak to Bam. The usual Caravan road would be again taken up between Bam and Regan vid Vakeeiabad and Bourj Asflia Muham mad- From Regan, a new route would also b * followed vm Chain Malil, NoMv- abad, Ramkan, Chah Gez, Henjareh, and skirting Pansara, with a loop-line to Bazman village, the line would run close to Parrek and Kaskin to Pahra. I made careful enquiries regarding the country between Pahra and Kuhak through Magas, and from what 1 could gather and from the description given of it by Captain Sykes and other travellers, it appears to he in every way the most suitalfie line to follow. Politically, too, the advantages would be great. I would therefore venture to suggest that Karachi be decided on as the objective, and that beyond Pahra the line should continue along the valley between the Komand and Lashari range to Magas, thence along the left bank of the Mashkeel river to Kuhak on the Perso-Kelat frontier, through Bela to Lyari, where we should strike our own line which runs to Karachi.•» A.

Sunday was spent in getting our stores and extra transport for the desert stages to Khash. We had to go to Deh \Tagi Khan to pick up our escort. Tnis is the last village on the desert where there is good water. Leaving Regan, the bridle path continued through low jungle for the first 5-8 miles, when it gave place to an open plain covered with small shmb, a stream of sweet water was crossed at the first mile, and at 2*77 miles the mud hamlet of Uahmatabad was passed on the right. Here, there is a stream ot good water, and supplies, in very limited quantities, are procurable. Near here also small hovels, made of branches of trees, were the first of the kind seen. At 7*20 miles, we were going north of east over an open plain and gradually descending, while at 9 37 miles we bore still more to the north and practically kept at this bearing for the rest of the journey, 71°. Salty efflorescence was noted at 11’56 miles, the sand being so impregnated ai to form cakes. A small dry torrent bed was crossed »t 12'25 miles, the deposit being pure salt. A brackish stream touched the road on our right at the 14th mile, and we crossed it a quarter of a mile before reaching our camp. The path is level and dry throughout, and could be made passable to wheeled traffic. It was difficult to take bearings through the jungle, but we seemed to be going a bit too far north and out of our way. Deh Yagi Khan to Halting place en route Chah Reis. Date. No, of March. Route.

The tamarisk bushes stopped at 2*89, and we emerged on to a large plain, the Dasht-i-Lut, which at first was sparsely covered with an earthy tumuli, but which at 5*13 miles became very stony and bare. Our direction was now a little south of east, and at 5*89 miles a black rock was passed 50 yards to the left. We had been gradually ascending in the direction of some small hills. We entered the b“d of a torrent at 9*95 miles, which our guide said was the Zahu, draining to the north-east, and emerged from it at 10*30. The banks are 12 to 15 feet high,, while the width is 120 yards. We reached the low stony hills at 13*11 miles, and crossed the highest point at 15*66, which was about 350 feet higher than Deh Yagi Khan (2,300 feet). Continuing through these hills, a sudden descent was made at 16*23 to a small plain, and we veered towards south-east again. At 17*98 miles, we passed through a narrow (60 yards) pass in the hills, £ 7—42166 known as the Dehnneh BulbuJab, or “singing water,” which is quite in con formity with the volcanic appearance of the surroundings, and halted in the desert. In summer, our march of to-day w T ould prove a hot and trying one, and there is not a drop of water en route. The ground round our camp was covered with a yellow flinty stone, and the country had a volcanic appearance. A little spade and shovel work would make the road fit for wheels.

At 2 64 miles, another track was seen going off to the left, bearing 100°, and this our guide informed us was a direct and mountainous road to Ladis. The bare black stony ground changed to sandy Kavir, covered with a thick efflorescence of salt at 4-90 miles, and here there was a strip of tamarisk bushes, giving at the same tin e fuel for us and grazing for the camels. The tamarisk strip continued to 6 84 miles, which point marked its limit as well as that of a small spring of brackish water known as the Ab-Goor-i-Kbar (wild asses’ water), lying 50 yards to the right of the road. Irv.m the /th to 10*73 miles, the track goes over absolute Kavir or salty desert, with nothing except a sort of grass known as shoreh, and is a beaten path, 2 feet or so wide and about 4 inches deep. The going on this beaten path is good, but on either side we sank into the salty sand, which at present is baked into crusty cakes, and found it hard work. When w r et, this ground would be practically impassable. Turning due east, we went through another strip of tamarisk from 10*73 to 12*18 miles, at which point we camped close to a v eU oi brackish and undrinkable water known as Chah Reis. Fuel and grazing in ihe vicinity of our camp w*ere abundant. The Kavir would preclude the possibility ol taking wheels along this route. Chah Reis to Samsoor. Date. No. of March. Route.

The path entered the Samsoor hills at 14*55 miles, and continuing in an easterly direction we reached the watershed at 16 04 miles, which wts some 880 feet higher than Ghah Reis, or about 3,100 feet. A gradual descent, in a direct on south of east brought us to the end of the Samsoor bills at 20'35 miles, when we emerged on to a very large plain covered with boteh and shrub, and gravelly soil. A prominent black, oblong, flat-topped hill, known as Tal-i-Samsoor, was passed close to our left at 23*05 miles, and at 23*45 we found our tents pitched on the left bank of the Samsoor stream, among a profusion of tamarisk and good grazing.

Starting from camp at the east base of the Talu-Samsoor/we took a direct line across the plain in the direction of the Jauri Band peak, bearing 120°. The plain is 18 miles from east to west and some 25 miles from norih to south. As already stated, its western extremity is bounded by the Samsoor hills, while on the north we have the Seah Band hills and on the south the lofty snow-capped Bazman. There was no defined track across the plain, as, consisting of a sandy gravelly soil a A where winds are very prevalent, all marks are at once obliterated. The first oue-and-half miles are t srough thick tamarisk,’which gives place to sand and small tamarisk np to 4*36 miles, where these end and gravelly soil is encountered. At 5 miles, our direction is almost south-east, and the going now becomes very stony, either intersecting or following the course of some small dry torrent beds draining north-north-west. We turn more to the east at 8*24 miles and continue gradually rising over very stony ground, while at 11 77 miles, turning still more to the east, 110°, we proceed up a large torrent bed which at 13 8 ) miles has a 20-foot bank on the left, or north, but no defined bank on the right. The Seah Band hills are gradually closing in on the north, while on the south a range of low sand hills reduces the valley to half a mile We enter the hills at 16*1*25 miles, which are only 50 yards to our right, while the base of the Seah Band is only some 200 yards distant, and camp at Ab Gajjaree, this being the Balooch pronunciation of the Persian word Kajar, Ab-i-Gajjauee to Jauri.

Our168 found some rain water m the torrent bea. i^rom tne top ul p^^ obtained a birds-eye view of the band of bills we were now going through. They were a perfect cluster of serrated peaks, which would be extremely difficult to negotiate except by following the torrent beds, and which could only be patrolled by men on foot. We emerged on to a small open plateau at 11'20 miles, where there was a profusion of Darmshoot, or grass, unfortunately withered for want of ram. Sam-i-Rajee Kuh, a flat-topped mountain, was passed at 13 50 miles, one mile to our right, and at 14 50 we were in a small plateau with sandy rolling hills on either side, in place ol rocky peaks, the tor rent bed being scarcely discernable and finally ending at 17 8o miles. Ihe watershed of Gardaneh-i-Jauri was reached at 18 05 miles, its height being 6,350 feei Crossing this saddle-back, we almost immediately entered a torrent bed draining east, our direction being southeast for the first mile, when we swing round to clue east. At 20 miles, the bills ended and, again turning to the left, we kept north-east till our camp was reached. The road is quite impass able to wheels, and is very narrow, rough and stony in the hills. The going in the end was good over tm open plain, As our yesterday’s march proved somewhat trying to man and beast and as we found a supply of drinkable water at Jauri, we decided to do a short march to Chahan-i-Ashahi. Leaving our camp at the north-east base of the Seah Band range, we struck across an open gravelly plain in an east-north easterly direction. A road from Siestan to Pahra crossed ours at 144 miles, bearing 143°, which was also the bearing of the Kuh-i-Karwanda. Passing a rocky hill on our right, we turned more to the east at 3 50 miles, having the Gut-i-Nadir on our left and Sar Talab on our right, and continued down a valley about 2 miles wide. At 4‘60 miles, we were going due east, while at 5 34 miles we went south of east. The Gut-i-Nadir we passed one mile to our left at 7 miles, while the Sar-i-Talab was a similar distance to our right, both high rocky peaks. We entered on a large open plain, probably Yar-Ahmad Zai, at 9‘30 miles and turned sharp to east-north-east, which bearing we kept up till we reached oup camp.

We are opposite the PurrpAugusht range, half a mile to our right, at 27*35 miles, and. the ground is now very rough and stony as it skirts the base of this rocky chain. We here enter a low chain of hills, the watershed being reached by an easy ascent at 27*88 miles and being 52*50 feet. The descent to our camp at Chashmeh Ziaret is very stony and rough, intersected with 2 or 3 nullah beds. During the rains, a large tract of the country in to-day’s route would be under water.

Our direction through out was a few points west of north. At ’75 miles, we entered a dry torrent bed and, leaving it at 1*50 miles, proceeded up a stony valley, some 500 yards wide, with low hills on either side. The valley at 4| miles was only 60 yards wide, and at 5 20 we turned due north, leaving it to cross a low ridge which formed a watershed, 6,150 feet. The road again turned to the west, and proceeded up a second very stony valley, passing a spring of salt water at 7 67 miles. The track bifurcates at 8‘10 miles, and a sharp descent brings us to a torrent bed and sweet water stream at 870 miles, the going over boulders and rock being extremely bad. The bed is some 500 yards broad, with bills and ravines on both sides, the direction being west of north. We are glad to leave the torrent bed again at 10’65 miles, and to get on to a fairly good track for the next mile, running between low hills. Making a sharp descent over sheet rock at 12'20 miles, we pass between a black rock hill on oar west and a white sand stone hill on our east, known as Seah Kuh and Gar-i-Safeed, respectively, at 12'90 miles, the passage being about 70 yards wide. The 13th mile brings us to a needle rock, Seikh Larumba, which is passed on the right, east, and here we enter a torrent bed, which we follow to onr camp at Seah Jungle, 1710 miles.

Thus, from the edge of the Narmasher to Janri’ we have a distance of 91-93 miles and from Jauri to Ziaret, near Khash 40-65 miles without a drop of potable water. We had carried a sufficient supply for 3 days, hoping the Samsoor spring would prove to he drinkable, hv! Vo tound it so briny that we sent to Kenjareh (which is ou the route recom mended), a distance of some 12 to 15 miles, for water. However, even after getting over the water difficulty, which could onto be done at great expense, we should have a still more intricate problem in the question of supplies. We carried provisions of every description for a month and had forage for 15 days. Lucky it was we did so, as on our arrival at the few tents which constitute Khash, the capital of Sarhad, it was only with the greatest digiculty that we succeeded in procuring a little fera-v for our camels. At Ladis, a similar disappointment awaited us, and it was not till our arrival m Siestan, one mouth subsequent to our departure from Eeo-an that we were able to replenish our exhausted commissariat. Thus, arrange’ meuts would have to be made to victual the whole of the workino- party duiino- the construction of the line between Regan and Ladis and also for the return journey, a distance of 210-72 miles, or, say, a period of 2J months at least We cannot omit the extra expenditure that would be incurred in the trans port of the material from the coast to Khash and Ladis, and the steps that would have to be taken to ensure its safe custody. Again, although there was nothing in the treatment accorded to us by the Sarhadis which could be taken exception to, it is a well known fact that' they are a turbulent and semi-savage race, and are practically allowed to go their own gait, and refuse to pay taxes, and boast in the name of Yaghees 'or out laws. The traveller in Sarhad cannot help getting the impression, whether red or imaginary, that he is in an inhospitable country, liable at any time to rise in revolt and beyond the power of the Persian Government. B 7—46 .[ 182 Jend Khan, the Damani Chief, has now been an outlaw for over a decade, and although the frequent forays which occur in Sarhad are laid at his door, I am inclined to think that there is more than one Jend Khan engaged on this work. Finally, we come to the question of building a Telegraph station and of locating a staff at Khask and Ladis, the only inhabited spots in the desert. The only buildings of any description seen between Regan and Siestan, or in fact in Sarhad, were the mud caravanserai forts at Khash and Sangoon. I could not therefore get any details regarding the prices of material, the greater portion of which would have to be transported from Bam, and would cost a large sum. The staff would find the life in the desolate mountainous region, cut off from all civilization, among a semi-barbaric and unintelligent people, a very trying one indeed, while special arrangements would have to be made for their safety and also to keep them in supplies.A. description of the track THE SECOND UNSUITABLE ROUTE FROM LADIS TO ROOD MAHEE via GALUGAN.

The Sargeh tents were noted ai 1 mile, close to our right, with the L &gt;dis river just beyond, while on our immediate left were tall grass and tamarisk. Entering the dry bed of the Tamin river at 1-63, we left it again at l'8d to cross a second dry nullah extending from 2 to 2*40 miles, known as the Dwodar, draining into the Ladis. We were now in a valley some 5 miles wide with the Ladis hills on the right and the Dwodar hills on the left, and, ascending it, pass the ruined fort of Dezuk at the top of a rock at 4 80 miles some half a mile to our left. The hills on the right are here known as Kuh-i-Shur, wdiilst those on the left are called Dezuk Kuh. Gradually ascending the valley, which has much grass and tamarisk, a brackish spring is jjassed at 5 miles and a sweet water one at 5*15, both 10 yards to the left. The brackish water is crossed at 5’80 miles, and at 6 40 the grass and reeds end, and the tamarisk at 7 10 miles gives place to an open gravelly plain about 3J to 4 miles wide, sparsely coveted with botch. Our direction is now due west. A line of old Kanats is passed at 7*60 miles. The valley narrows to IJ miles at 9 90, the Kuh-i-Shur on the right giving place to the Kuh-i-Poozeh. Continuing up the valley, which gradually widens to 2 miles again, Kuh Chah Deraz is seen straight in front, bearing 273° at 12-50 miles, while at 13-50 miles the track touches the hills on the left, and a few yards further on these hills give place to a high range, Kuh-i-Anjereh. Also, at this point, 13-75 miles, the Kuh-i-Shur on the right is replaced by Kuh-i-Kagezek, a reddish coloured range. At 14 miles, some old dry Kanats are passed on the right, while at the 16th mile we are opposite the sharp peak of Anjereh, 197°. We get a glimpse of the rocky precipitous snow capped Shah Savaran at 19-50 miles, bearing 202°. The ruined Kaleh of Junabad lies half a mile to the right at 19'80 miles, and we here keep in a torrent bed, and at 20 50 miles the track touches the hills on the right. A few yards further on, we reach the dry well and halt by a clump of tamarisk hushes, known as Gezan Bazmanee, Gez Bazmanee to Camp. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles.

This is a good camping ground with plenty f fuel and grazing. We now take a W.-N.-W. direction up the Talley which raduallv narrows to 2 miles with the Kuh Chah Deraz on the left and t e hah Kuhi on the right. Chah Deraz, a well with a sprinkling of sweet water, b 7—47is passed at 6*14 miles, and the hill of that name, with stone cairns on its summit, is noted at 6 70 miles. The Chah Deraz range ceases at 8'20 miles and here is the watershed, 6,875 feet, dividing the eastern drainage into the Ladis river from the western into the Rood Mahi. The watershed is open and is about 1 mile broad and flat. The descent is very similar to the ascent* m that it goes down a gravelly valley some 2 miles broad, covered with boteh’ the direction being nearly north-west. At 10 60 miles, we halt at some tamarisk hushes for lunch at 11 a. m., but one of my wheelmen, who left 10 minutes after we did this morning, with my horse, lost himself, so we had to camp here. I sent back a guide and a second wheelman on a Jumbaz at 11 a. m. and another party at I p. m. They all turned up at 8 p. m., the poor beast having had a 15f hours’ walk. o Camp to Camp. Date.

This river bed when in flood must he quite impassable for days, A prominent peak, Ivuh-i-Twosuree, is passed at the second mile, some 300 yards to the right, and at 3 miles the Kuh Padeshah, bearing 19°. We here turn due west, and at 4'50 notice a track going to the right rear to Kaleh Padeh. Following the sinuosities of the torrent bed, we pass a spring of sweet water at 7-36 miles. The path takes to the right bank here lor a few yards, and we go through a graveyard at S’hO miles, while at 9 miles we notic? the first water or source of the Rood Mahee. 9 30 miles brings us to Sheerdil Khan’s tents, while at 10 30 we reach Gul Mohommed’s tents, the whole place being known as Rood-i-Mahee. I I continued beyond and, taking a hearing of 305°, left the river bed, which bore 335°, and struck across a very stony plain to the hills, which we entered at 12‘35 miles, and after an easy climb reached the top of the pass, 4,570 feet, at IS’SO miles. I had a view of the whole plain from here, and could see the marshy ground that marks Hyderabad, some 10 miles off. The sandy Dasht-i-Lut, without life or ha/bitation, could be seen stretching for some 90 miles towards Regan, the position of which could only just be discerned. Between Rood Mahee and Regan, across the desert, the following names of halting places, at each of which there is said to be a well of brackish water, were given to me: Konarek 18 miles; Shoroo 15 miles; Dashtoo 30 miles, leaving 27 miles to Regan,—a total distance from Ladis of 176’30 miles.191 2§th December 1898.

GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE SECOND UNSUITABLE ROUTE FROM LADIS TO ROOD MAHEE via GALUGAN. is 7—4U195 General Summary. f n 1 P ti f r d f n P ° S f bte direct route ’ throu g h a* easy and more ertiletract for the me to follow from Kegan to iLadis, I decided to inspect the country due west of Lad.s and accordingly left that place, with ten run ning camels and 10 days’ supplies, for Galugan and Rood Mahee. The country to Galugan 76-15 miles, is open and easy, when we enter the Seah Band range and follow the sinuosities of the large bed of the Rood Mahee which, though dry when we passed, comes down annually in flood. The drain age area is very large, and I was told this rood was impassable for 4 or 5 days after a rainfall, the bed is some 200 yards wide, and is confined between high rocky and precipitous mountains. The total length of this defile is some 15 miles, and there appears to be no other cleft in this rocky chain within a distance of 50 miles. The only way of carrying the line through here would he to “ jump the poles into the rock face horizontally. At Rood Mahee, we were on the western edge of this chain of hills, on the eastern exfciemity of the Dasht-i-Rut, and climbing a peak I saw the desert waste stretching towards Regan. On this route, up to Rood Mahee, the greatest distance without water is 26 miles, but from Rood Mahee to Regan, across the desert, there is again a stretch of over 90 miles without sweet water, and where the supply is brackish and precarious from wells. In the total distance from Ladis to Regan, some 176 miles, the only tents seen were 8 or 10 on the Galugan plain, and 12 at Rood Mahee, where supplies were not procurable, and which were inhabited by migratory Baloochies. There was no cultivation, and they informed me they imported wheat, etc., from 8iestan. What has been written on the many disadvantages pertaining to the Khash route equally applies to the one now described, and no object can be gained by again repeating the many objections to this route. I took a bee line, due north, across conntry to Dozdab and Malik Seah Kuh, thence to Siestan, to get supplies, but as the line would not go up this route, a description of the track and gazetteer only have been given as an appendix to this section, while the return journey from Malik Robat to Regan is given as the third unsuitable route.A.

This small dry torrent bed continued up a valley some 500 yard* wide with a lange of low red coloured hills on the right and high hills on the left. At the 10th mile, we went due nortn-east, and at 11 miles passed the well of Twosooree, which conuained water and where there were bucket and rope to draw the water with. Gradually ascending the ever-widening valley, and keeping north-north-east, the red hills on the right stop at 16 10 miles, and at this point we cross the valley in a north-easterly direction to a range of hills, vhicn we enter at 18‘15 miles, and continue through them, the going being' very bad at times. We reached the watershed at 2T80 miles. ^Dard-Shoor and the Dasht of the same name are seen hearing due east and about 4 miles off. The descent on the east side is good and easy. The hills end at 24 miles, and we enter the Dasht. The Kanat of sweet water and tamarisk jungle known as Dar-i-Shoor is reached at 25 44 miles. The track is scarcely fit for pack animals and is very rough. Our camels suffered terribly, and I was afraid they would give in. Dar-i-Sfoor to Kerneh. Date. N&lt;&gt;. of March.

Our direction now is more to east of south-east over a sandy plain, but with plenty of fuel in parts. We skirt the Dumag Kuh, which, at 6*20 miles, bears 29° and is about miles to our ieft. The sandy heavy going gives place to stony ground at 8'50, and from here Kuh Sheikh can be seen bearing 312°. The next 8 miles are monotonous to a degree, while at 16 miles the Kuh-i-Guh begins on our left, and we are in undulating ground. Skirting the base of the Kuh-i-Ouh, we at 18 miles go almost due east, and a few yards further on cross a torrent bed, draining south, and enter some rolling hills. We continue through tuese rolling hills for 5 miles, when at the 23rd mile we are on the level plateau, and onr direction is east of north-east. At the 24th mile, the Ruh-i-Guh ends and the Herneh Knh starts. At 25 miles, we go down a torrent bed with tamarisk bushes and at 26 miles join the main road from Siestan to Bampur. Up to this point, we have practically been going across country—at least, I could see no track. Our direction is now due north-east and continuing down the torrent bed, with its tamarisk bushes, we reach the spring of brackish water known as Herneh,Herneh to Dozab. : fslo nf Intermediate Total Date.

The road bifurcates at the 3rd mile, the main track going to the left to Manzilab, while we keep straight on. At o‘60 miles, we get our first view of KuU Kateha, bearing 54°. We entered a dry nullah at 7‘90, and follow it, the valley at 8*20 being about 2 miles broad, with Kuh Manzilab, 304°, to our left and Kuh Haiyad Khan, 98°, to our right. The torrent bed is left at 10‘70, and we enter the large sandy plain of Dozab, and continue over it with a bearing of 21° for the next 8^ miles, viz.) to 19 miles, when the track is obliteiated and we change our course to a point or two west of north.^ We are a oing towards a range of low black hills which bound the Dozab plain on the north. Skirting these hills for a mile, we airive at Dozab spring, of almost sweet water, in a jungle of tamarisk bushes at 2T84 miles. For part of this distance, we have been on the main road from Siestan to Bampur, which is a fairly well beaten track some 18 inches to 2 feet broad. The stage is open to wheeled traffic throughout. Although there is no actual road, the plain, being level and sandy, ofiers no obstacle. There were two tents at Dozdab spring and two or three more in the valley. Dozab to Malik Seah Kvh. Date.

A ridge is reached at 3f miles, and a descent made down a valley, about a mile broad, for a mile, when we again ascend and r&lt; ach the watershed, 5,940 feet, at 7‘50 miles, From this point, the road can be seen for the next 6| miles keeping in the centre of a valley about a mile broad. Gradually descending, we reach the lowest point of the valley at lO GO miles, when we cross the Mian Bazar nullah, which bears off 80° and which flows due east through the Lar mountains, or at right angles to our road. We again ascend, and at 14-10 miles reach a second watershed, and almost instantly enter the Shemadar torrent bed, with high precipitous rocky mountains on either side, in some places the breadth being only 40 to 50 yards. During rain, this must be impassable for three or four days. At 15-30 miles, the track from Nasratabad (Kerman) via Pepeelee joins in on the left, or west. A spring of sweet water, known as Chashmeb Shemadar, was reached at 17-50 miles, and after this the nullah again became very narrow with sheer rock on both sides, At 20 miles, we leave the Shemadar torrent bed, which bears 81°, while we go on over a plain bearing 5°. This torrent finally goes down to Malik Bobat, 7 miles distant. Continuing over undulating ground, the mountains recede to a mile distant on either side. At 23 35 miles, the road from Bobat joins in on the right.

We now emerge on to the Shelag desert, there being notiiing to break the view in front (N.-N.-E.) or to our right (E -S.-E.), whilst on our left the low Tars ha b hills are seen some distance off. We gradually swing round to the north, and at 3 miles our bearing is 23°. The track descends over stony ground, and a path joins in on our right rear, which is said to be a short-hand cut to Kuh-i-Malik Seah. At 9 miles, the stones end, and we are now travers- ing a gravelly plain which is covered with “ Meez,” a species of shrub which camels are fond of. We enter a strip of tagaz, a diminutive tree of the tama risk species, at 10J miles, which continues to 14»’50 miles. This tree is excellent fuel, and,.it is from here the fuel supply, s transported to Siestan. At 11*40 miles, wo are on the plain proper, and here the first sand drifts are seen. From this point to our camping ground at 14'30 miles, the view is obstructed by the thick growth of tagaz and by numerous Tumuli, and sand drifts.

Wefollowed the right bank of the river for three-fourths of a mile, when w r e crossed it, the width being *32 miles at this point, with shelving sandy banks. The track now takes a directi m 13° east of north and is over Pat and Kavir. At 7*10 miles, or 2 , 25 miles from the river, we pass some Gombaz in ruins. The guide said these were habitations, but I think they must have been tombs. Continuing over Kavir and Pat, we pass Gird-i-Chah half a mile to the east at 16 miles, and at 17’38 miles halt at Seah Hauz, where there are a pond and well of brackish water. The ground is sparsely coverd with meez and tamarisk. If miles to the east-south-east (103'’) are the ruins of Ramrud. The Nalar shown in the map is now buried in sand. Seah Hauz to Assak Chah. Date.

The mound of Hak is passed at 5‘50 miles, 400 yards to our east, and we reach the Lasbgeran wells at 6-70 miles, some of which contain brackish water. This is evidently a halting place. The Gombaz-i- Miskie, ruined tombs, are passed at 9*50 miles about a mile to the west. There are two of these sun-dried brick, domed, tombs standing. Continuing over alternate Kavir and Pat, which during Avet weather would be practically impassable, we pass the ruined Kaleh of Kundar at miles, 50 yards to our left, west. We here make a sudden dip of some 5 feet on to hard Pat, which is evidently subject to annual inundation, and changing our direction to north-east bear for Hauzdar, which ruined village we pass'at 17 miles, and taking a bearing of 10° we go across country to Assak Chah, where there are a number of wells, 3 or 4 w*ith brackish and putrid water, where the shepherds water their flocks. We halt on a hard Pat plain. During dry weather, there is nothing to prevent wheels from traversing this Kavir plain, but during the wet season the Kavir portions would prove very trying, if not impassable. Assak Chah to Warmal.

The roads throughout Siestan change, and guides should always betaken. The whole country is liable to inundation, the inhabitants saying the days are Neem-rooz, or half-daj*s, and give this as their reason for building in sun-dried bricks only. The villages are all built on mounds, which are partly natural, partly' artificial, and which anpear to be an accumulation of horse manure and straw. The houses are of sun-dried bricks, very rough and domed, without windows or glass. The canals, which a r e cleaned out aunuady, are from 5 to 6 feet broad, and have 2 or 3 feet of water.

The walls are of mud and about 20 feet high. Attached to Nasratabad is Hossinabad, an open Tillage in a ruined state. The whole concern consists of 800 houses with a population of 4,000 people. There is no bazaar, and our servants failed to get a single European product. Black smiths, shoemakers and carpenters of a very nondescript class are procurable. Supplies are procurable, hut it is better to get them at the villages en route, such as Warmal, Dowletabad, Sadakee, Chilling, etc. The whole of Siestan is liable to inundation, and the people speak of it as neem-rooz, i.e., half-day, meaning that a flood might come and submerge the village at any time.213 Nasratabad to Malik Robat.

Webb-Ware, and here I spent 2 days in engaging camels. From Warmal, the road already traversed en route to Siestan was followed to Hurmak. Leaving Hurmak on the 26th January, the Dozdab route was taken to 10 35 miles, wh re the road bifurcates, the Dozdab road bearing 175°, while that to Malik Robat swings to the left, with a bearing of 128°. Following the course of a small torrent bed, with a gravelly plain on our right, we reach a small watershed at 11*50 miles, and from this point continue over open ground. On our left, we have the Kuh Malik Seah range, about half a mile off, while on oar immediate right the ground is cut up, stretching towards the Lar Kuh. At 14*30 miles, we enter a torrent bed and, continuing down this, join the main Shamidar nullah at 15*20 miles, where we turn to 73 c , and at 16*50 miles see our flag waving over the Robat Tana, which bears 45°. We continue towards the Tana, descending, in the broad torrent bed, wh ch is rough and stony and about 200 yards wide, finally reaching the Robat at 17J miles. I here met Mr. Armstrong, of the Indian Government Telegraph Department, Capt. Roome in charge of the escort, and Mr. Vredenburg, of the Geological Department, and spent a day with them. » V —54217 Malik Kobat to Pepelee. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles.

At 1 40 miles, the torrent bed is a little over l50 yards Avide, and we swing to the west here. At 3 40 miles, the road bifurcates, the Pepelee and Dozdab road ascending the .Shemadar torrent bed, while the road to Malik Seah Kuh and Siestan goes olf to the right, bearing 302°. Continuing up the torrent bed, Ave join the main Siestan-Bampur road at 6'75 miles,, and at 7 miles change our direction to south. We are now among the Shemadar mountains, which are high, rocky and precipi tous, and continue up the Shemadar torrent bed, Avhicii has an average width of 100 yards, but at S’SO miles is only 20 yards broad. The Shemadar spring of sweet water is passed at 9 40 miles. The road again bifurcates at 1U62 miles, the main track, bearing 165°, going towards Bozdab, while we branch oil, hearing 182°, for half a mile, and then due west for the rest of the march. Leaving the Shemadar torrent bed, we ascend a small nullah, at times very rocky and narrow. The hills on either side are small and open. The torrent bed at 12 , 80 miles was only 5 yards wide.

The watershed AA as reached at 1’10 miles,and is 7,500 feet. A someAvhat sharp descent, through Ioav hills, brought us to the end of the lange at 2 3o, and we emerge on to a large gravelly plain, having on the south the Lashshek and Petekee mountains, with a low range of hills running on our right, about a mile distant The road bifurcates here, the southerly one bearing 222 and going to wards Galu-an. Two small black rock hills bearing 292° were pointed out as the alignment, and we struck across the plain in their direction. Thedrainage wasdue south. Between the 7th and 8th mile, we passed through a strip of lagez, from Avhieh any quantity of fuel could be collected. The gravelly and stony plain gave place to stony ground at 8-75 miles, and Avas somewhat rough for a mile A black hill bearing 208° and known as Leredek, was passed at 10*60 miles, about half a mile to ouAeft, while the first of the two black rocks already mentioned was passed at 11*70 miles, about 20 yards to our right. Our camp was pitched at the 13th mile on the plain. Prom our camping ground, bearing 36 , and about 2 miles distant in the low range of hills, are some springs of brackish water. b 7 — 55Kondeh to Gauageh. Date. No. of Miles. Route.

At 5*20 miles, the heretofore gravelly to sandy soil gave place to Pat sand, which broke under foot and made the going heavy. 1 his in turn gave [dace to fine grave!, with good grazing, at 7*20 miles. 1 had noticed that the gravel up to this point was of a white marble appearance, which now changed to a black hard stone. A small Ilamun was seen about 2 miles to the right, or north, at 9*t&gt;0 miles. With absolutely nothing to break the weary monotony, we held on our way, and at IG'20 miles noticed a road Irom 8iestan to Galugan crossed ours. The plain came to an end at 5 7*40 miles, where we passed over undulating ground, and had small hills on either side. A dry torrent bed, draining north, was crossed at 18*40, and at 19 miles we passed a high rocky mil, on our right, and small ones on our left. Our ituide had h-en making for the wrong springs, so, swinging to the right (north), we went round the base of the high rooky hill referred to, and continuing over sandy undulating ground came to a saddle-hack, from whence I saw the tents, bearing 20°. Descending on to the western end of the same nlain we had been marching along all day, we went across it through an abundance of Tagez, fuel and grazing, and reached our camp at 27^ miles.

February 1899 4' Nasratabad, 3,836 feet. 24*40 77 98 Taking a due westerly direction, through a thick growth of Tagez, camel thorn, etc., an&lt;i over sandy soil, we join the main route from Siestan to Regan at 1’80 miles, which is the best defined road seen since leaving the last- mentioned place nearly two months ago. The thick growth and sandy soil give plac^ to bare white hard gravel ground. The road is excellent, and at 3 G0 miles crosses a ridge. At 4*50 miles, the bearing is west of south-west, which is maintained for the next 8 miles. The going is excellent, gradually ascend ing in the direction of a low range of hills, a spur of the Maluzan mountains. A small dry torrent bed is crossed at 11 80 miles, and at 12*10 miles the direct road from Kondee joins in on our left. The low hills are entered at 12T0 miles, and turning due west for three-fourths of a mile we proceed up a rocky torrent bed. Two pools of sweet water were passed, on the light, at 12*50 miles, which are said to be perennial. The watershed dividing the Nasratabnd plain from the Garageh-Kondee plain was reached at 12*75 miles, and is 5,500 feet in height. Our direction is now south of west, and we at once enter a torrent bed with the high Maluzan nil’s on our right and low rocky hills on the left. The road now practically keeps, to this torrent bed till 14 90 miles, when a bifurcation takes plac a . We follow the right, 232^, while the larger219 track goes off 185°. Leaving the torrent hod at 16 4.0 miles, we go over a gravelly ridge, gradually descending into a second nullah at 17'70 miles, hut shortly a tei eave it again and, getting on to tlie higii ground, see Nasratabad ^Kerman) in the plain, bearing ^35 . TV T e continue over very stony ground to the 22nd mile, when the track improves, and is finally sandv at 23'50 miles.

From 1*25 to 2 , 20 miles, there are m my s »nd drifts, and the growth uraduilly decreases. Clearing the drifts, we get on to a hard and stony plain, gently rising, and are in the debris of the drainage. At 3*50 miles, the track is very rough, and continues so till its entrance into the hills at 5 80 miles. We now ascend a ravine some 50 yards wide, with steep rocky hills on either side, and change our direction a trifle to south of south-west. A spring, perennial, Ab-i-Konjee, with some young date trees, is passed at 6*40 miles, 5 ) yaris to our right. Continuing up the ever- narrowing ravine, with the hills gradually becoming higher and steeper, we reach the Darwazeh, or irate, of Nadir at 9 miles. This is a ridge of rock which runs at right angles to the road, and through whicn the torrent has cut a way 9 feet wide. There is some masonry, and such artificial me ms as have been executed to convert it into a gate are attributed to .Nadir, the watershed, also known as Darwazeh Nadir, was reached at 9 /d miles, and is 4,775 feeu Following the southern drainage, known as Ghedeh Mullah Ali, the descent, like the ase mt, is gentle down the torrent bed, with rocky hilis on either side, and only 50 to 00 yards wide. A dry sprmg is parsed at 10'65 to the left, fuming to the west, the torrent bed, passing through a cut with high rock on cither side, opens out to 100 vards, and at 13 25 we pass a second spring, known as Komreh, also dry.

The road bifurcates at 9-25 miles, the left hand one, bearing 185°, going to Regan, via Mazerab, while we keep to the main road, bearing 190°. Sand drifts begin at 10 90 miles, and at 1 2*60 are thick and across the road, ihe^e drifts finish on the right at 13*50 miles, and gradually recede on the left, and stop on that side at 15 miles. A very low gravelly sandy range of hills, which started at 5 miles, and about 3 miles to our right, has been gradually approach- ing and at 15 miles is only half a mile distant, while at 17'40 miles we swing round its end. We now turn to the south-west and, passing over a gravelly firm road, reach Gurg. On our left, we have good grazing and tamarisk trees, and several old dry Kanats, the relies of a once inhabited place. The water at Gurg has to be dug for and is quite undrinkable for man, Road open to wheels. Gorg to Camp. (Near Mil Nadari.) Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles.

This, my guide informed me, was not toe Rood Mahee, hut a stream which rises further norrh. At 2'20 miles, all growth stopped on our left, and desert, nothing hut sandy desert, as hare as the palm of one’s hand, stretched on all sides. The going was excellent, fit for wheels of all sorts, though monotonous, oh I so painfully monotonous. At the 9th mile, there was a sudden depression, and we kept, on this lower ground till the ruins of a mud caravanserai were reached at 12 miles. Near here, the country appears to be liable to inundation. My aneroid shows 28*T5,1,4*00 feet. From the 13th mile, we make a gentle rise, and reach a crest at 14*30 miles, and at 14*50 a low mound or rather sand-hill is passed, 50 yards to the left, a not over conspicuous, but the only, land mark in view. At the 15th mile, we again dip into a depression, and continue over broken undulating ground to our camp, which is some 400 yards to the right, near a tiny patch of camel grazing and a little short of the ruins of Mil-i-Nadiri. The heat during the middle of the day was trying, and one trembles to think what it must be in mid-summer. We are said to be camped near the site of the city of Lut, which, tradition says, the Almighty turned upside down and buried its wicked and immoral inhabitants. Camp to Shur Gez. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 6 th February 1899 8 Shur Gez. 1207 145*06 At a very early hour, Ave had started on our w r ay through the sand drifts to Shur Gez. Still keeping our former direction of south-east, we passed the ruins of Mil-i-Nadiri at 1*50 miles, 10 yards tq our right. Absolute bare, hard,221 ground, without a tree, a blade of grass, or any animate object, was visible. As a “something to note ’’ I entered in my field book that a slight depres sion was crossed at 4A0 miles. At 8 50 miles, we were among the sand drifts, and here we had great difficulty in finding our way. A strong wind was blowing Iroin the south, which made the sand sweep and swirl iif every direction, reminding one of the bad snow drifts in Scotland. Woe betide the unfortunate traveller who loses his way here. We were shown the course of the Rood Mfihee at 9 30 miles, which evidently spreads over a lar^e area and ultimately gets lost in the sands. A few tamarisk hushes now cheered us on our way, but the drifts were still to be seen on all sides. Shur Grez, a well of brackish water, was reached at the I2th mile. Of ail the many desert marches it has been my lot to make, X think the stage from Gurg to Shur Gez, of 32 miles, is the worst. Hie going is heavy and tiring at times, and one wonders how Craeterus managed to bring his large force along here! Tne country must have been in a more fertile state then than it is now?

Just on clearing the few tamarisks at the 5th mile, the famous Mil-i-Nadir is seen in the distance, and bears 259°. An absolutely level, bare, st rile, and barren desert track takes us towards it, and we reach it at 13 miles exactly. A high wind accompanied bv sand had just sprung up, and I could not get a clear view from the top of the Mil. The dimensions are given by Sir F. Goldsmid as “ height 55 feet; base circumference 43 feet, slightly tapering to the top ; thickness of wall feet; bricks 14 by 12 by 2 inches,” with 49 steps up a spiral staircase. We again change our dir ’Ction to south-west, and had a terrific sand-storm to face, which filled up eyes, nose, ears and month, and added to the miseries of our march. We could see nothing, and it was more by luck than good guiding that 17 50 miles brought us to fum-i-Reeg sand hills, but we found not hing there, so, continuing on for 2 miles, we at last found our loads amongst some tamarisk bushes. The tents had been blown down, and it was out of the question to think oi pitcuing them, as a strong wind was blowing with the sand drifting at a great pace and obscuring every thing. Camp to Eahreh.

The first 4 miles from our camping place near Tum-i-Reeg was over a gravelly desert, when we passed through country sparsely clad with tamarisks and diminutive kahur. We hud practically bid farewell to the Kerman desert, the Dasht-i-Iuut, and were rapidly approaching green fields and palms and habitations. At 7 90 miles, a ruined buiJdin^, 10?) yards to our left, while at a similar distance to the right the first si^as of habitations since Aasratabad (1st lebruary 1S99) weit seen in the shape of some Hashems, or black tents. A large ruined Kaleh, oi foit, b 7—56222 was passed Jth mile to our right, and at 9 50 miles we passed over the edge of a range of sand hills. A.t this point (9’50), there is a small Mdl or pillar, 50 yards to the right, known as Chahwish, and marks the spot where a famous robber was built up alive, some 8 years ago, by Ismail Khan Javar. A rich plain was now in view, with an abundance of sweet running water. At 9^ miles, we changed our bearing to 259°, and at 10 miles passed through cultiva tion and fallow land to 11*50 miles, where we noticed a stream of water emerging from a Kanat, and camped on the high ground just above it. Ihe measurement to the village was 12 miles. Kahreh to Hajiabad. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 9th February 1899 11 Hajiabad. 14*94 191*30 For the first mile after leaving Fahreh, we traversed a sandy plain, with several Kanats, in a south-south-east direction, and entered a thin jungle, which became very thick at 3*50 miles. The Kanat of sweet water co ring from Ibrahimabad, a hamlet half a mile to our right, was passed at 4*20 miles, while half a mile further on we passed through Junabad, on some rising ground, and have an extensive view of the jungle and the desert, which is on a lower level to tho north-east and east. The jungle gradually opens out, and, after passing the small hamlet of Bording at 5*75 miles, we emerge on to a hard gravelly plain, and have an excellent road to our camp. A track from Bourj Agha Mohamad to Deh Yagi Khan crosses ours at 6 60 miles, and at 6*75 we pass the hamlet of Zaminabad with its pond of sweet water and cultivated land. There is nothing of note as we cross the desert plain, keeping our south-south east direction, till 11 *40 miles, when we pass close to the left of a big tamarisk tree. At 13 90 miles, a line of Kanats flowing from west to east, the water of which can be reached by a five-foot rope, is passed. A track crosses ours at 14*40 miles, and at 14*75 we pass a kiln for baking Kanat pipes, where there: is a stream of sweet water. We camp on the banks of the stream, and a quarter of a mile to the east of Hajiabad, where the grazing is good. Hajiabab to Kegan. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles.

It was difficult to take or register any true bearing, but I made it 155° for the first 3 miles, and 146° for the remain ing 6 miles. Several streams of sweet, limpid water, whose banks were fringed with a delicate green grass and clover, also many Kanats, crossed our path. We could not see beyond the distance of a mile on either side. It is therefore possible several hamlets escaped our notice. Ababad at *70 miles, Mahmad- abad at 2 65 miles and another village at 3’40 miles were seenou the right side, while Meerabad was to our left at 1 40 miles. I noted that the cultivation of Began started at 6 60 miles and continued up to the town, 8*88 miles. Here we were back again in Began after an absence of just 2 months. The climate is much warmer, and spring well advanced.GAZETTEER OF THE THIRD UNSUITABLE ROUTE FROM Malik Robat to Regan.225 27/A January 1899, Malik Robat. Height 3,100 feet.

We now come to the third and last route surveyed with the object of effecting a junction with the Quetta-Nushki trade route at Malik Seah Kuh. Leaving Captain Sykes on the 21st January 1899 at Warmal, the first inhabited spot on the south of Siestan, where I had purchased a month’s supplies, I retraced my steps to Malik Robat in companv with Captain Webb- Ware to meet Mr. Armstrong of the Indian Telegraph Department. I arrived at Malik Robat on the 26th, and spent the following day in exchanging views with Mr. Armstrong on the advisability of taking a tele graph line along the trade route. From the description given to me of the country between Quetta and Malik Robat by Mr. Armstrong, I was led to believe that the construction of a telegraph line along this route of 500 odd miles would prove a difficult and costly undertaking. Leaving the Robat on the 28th, I followed the only track which connects Nasratabad on the west with the main routes in the east, but it was practically a ease of going across country. For the first 15 miles, we were among the mountains, off-shoots of the great Lar range, when we emerged on to a plain and could see an open valley on our left rear leading towards Dozdab. Crossing the plain, which is some 40 miles in width, we enter the Maluzan range of low hills, which are some 5 miles wide and are easy. E nerging from these, we see Nasratabad, a small walled village, in the centre of a salty desert plain, where about a square mile of land has been reel a mod, but where we could get no supplies. Leaving this, the only habitation seen during the past 4 days, we cross in a day’s march of 16 miles another range of rocky hills (Nakheleh) and debouch on to the Dasht-i-Lut. It takes us 5 long marches to cross this bleik, lonely, and desolate wilderness of sand, where there are only two spots, Gurg and Shur Glez, where salt water, quite unfit to drink, is obtained by digging wells. Thus, we have three stretches of 35*03, 32*05 and 31*30 miles without water, waile that procurable at Gurg and Shur Gez cannot be drunk by human beings. In addition to all the disadvantages on the other two unsuitable routes, the one under discussion has the further misfortune of running thrmgh sand drifts and sand hills for a certain portion of its length. We were caught in a sand storm, and found the experience anything but pleasant. All my tents wer ^ blown down, and we could not re-pitch them till sunset, spending t ic ui ci ini of 5 hours behind a tamarisk bush. These sand-storms are, I was told, ot fre quent occurrence. The heat, too, in summer must be tenific, and the patio ling and inspecting of the line through such a country could only b^ came out at a certain amount of risk to life. In summarising on these three routes, I would most respectfully beg leave to state that, after careful consideration and comparison with the route recommended, I condemn all three as inadvisable, difficult, expensive an&lt; un suitable in every way, at the present time, for the construction, rna n enanc., and ultimate success of an international telegraph line. By following any of these routes, we should be running the hue over an solute waterless and uninhabited desert for miles, and when at last the &amp;nr,ia. mountains are reached we are but a little bettei on. It would appear an erroneous impression exists as to the actual size and .portanee of such places as D.zdab and Ladis at the former ot winch there l but 4 or 5 tents, while in the vicinity of the latter there some 4 o 5 campments, with little or no cultivation, the inhabitants bun, pmctic. . pendent on the importation of supplies from toiestan. In disposing of these three unsuitable routes, and as the one recommended r the Central Persia Telegraph line is embodied m the lr ^ mpleted all the trans-Regan sections, and must transpose oa.selves to U. s d expound on the journey to Cvvadnr, wmci is given a= the I tn le Route.” b 7-58233 'V Pahra to Absowaran. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 28th February 1899 ... 1 Absowaran, 3,350 feet. 21-90 21-90 Leaving our camp a few yards south of Palira Kaleh, we lake a due south-easterly direction towards the mountains, and, after crossing two small streams running towards Bampur, we strike the first bed of the river at 75 miles. Prom this point to l'20 miles, there are two beds, each about 70 yards broad, with no depth and gravelly bottom. These channels were dry, and onlv contain water after heavy rain. We cross more channels at P80 and at 3T8 miles, while the sand drifts begin at the first-mentioned point, and we enter tamarisk jungle at 2*15 miles, which becomes thinner at 4 miles and stops altogether at h’SS, giving place to a gravelly plain sparsely coverd with shrub. The back bearing of Pahra at 8m0 miles was 313°, while Katakan was 15°, Ahmedabai 30°, and Aptar 36°, A cairn of stones, a few yards to the right, marks 8J miles. The first Poozeh Cnah, an old dry well, was passed close to our right at 91- miles, while the second, a few yards to our left, occurred at 11-15 mdes. We had been gradually ascending a gravelly plain, which was getting stony as we approached the hills, which we entered at 15‘30 miles. The back bearing to Bampur Fort was 290°. The going to this point is good. Changing our bear ing to south-south-east, we continue along a ridge and pass a graveyard to our left at 15^ miles, and at 15-80 miles enter the broad dry gravelly bed of the Shahab. We keep in the bed of this nullah for the remainder of the march, which averages 400 yards in width, with high precipitous mountains on the light, known as Keseh Chand, while those on the left are rocky, and, though not quite as high, are more cut up. The Aptar roan joins in at 16-95 miles on the left. The guide pointed out a track branching off to the right at 17J miles, which he said went to Cheshmeh Takhshok, a spring of sweet water about a mile distant. To the left, at 18 miles, a track leads to Manzan, where there is water after rain. A second graveyard was passed at 18-10 miles, on the right, and third, on the left, at 20 miles. An old broken down wall of stones, through which the road now runs, wms said to he the remains of a dam, and there was'* cultivation here in former times. The Ah Dozan spring was passed J a mile to the left at 21-20 miles, and we here left the road, which hears 113°, and, taking a bearing of 162° for J a mile, and 210° for another f, halt 300 yards short of the Absow&amp;ran spring. The road is open to artillery throughout, except after rain, when it is impassable for 3 or 4 days. Absowaran to Camp, Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 1st March 1899 2 Camp, 4,680 feet. 16-17 38-07 We retraced our steps, and at one mile again struck the nullah, whose meander!no-s we followed throughout the march, with 103° as our average hearing; but it was extremely difficult to fix a correct bearing. The tonent bed gradually narrows, and contains a rich growth of tamarisk and some dwart b 7—59234 palms. At TOO miles, the right bank is a sheer rock, while the left bank is 300 yards off and is also rocky. Gradually ascending the gravelly bed, the Sohran spring of sweet water, one mile to the left, is pointed out at 5'30 miles. The valley opens out a bit at 5^- miles, and the hills on both sides are smaller, and we here leave the bed for a short distance, and, going through a small “ tangi ” or defile at 6 miles, again descend to the river. At 8^ miles, the right bank h is been cut away by floods and is some 15 feet high. A large graveyard is noted at 9T6 miles. All these graveyards are said to be very old and to have been the scene of bloody fights between the various Balooch tribes. IVe note the spring of Kalieree 50 yards to the right at 9f miles, which we found nearly dry. Just beyond Kalieree, 10'50 miles, the road bifurcates, the left track going to Serbaz via Torkestan, up the nullah of that name, and, crossing the watershed, runs down the Henanoo torrent bed and joins the Serbaz a few miles north of the village. This road is said to have been traversed by artillery, but it is out of the way and never followed by travellers, who prefer the ispatki route. Its only advantage is in th nullah being somewhat wider. The Porkestan nullah bears 90°, while we t ike 127° as our hearing. Tire with high ever-narrowing nullah is only 50 yards wide at 12'85 miles, precipitous rocks on both sides. A short cut foot-path breaks off at 13 miles, and at 13^ miles we are in a very narrow “ tangi,” not more than 10 feet, with a rocky bottom. There is a little sweet water here known as Pa ah, which practically continues up the nullah, while at 13 - 85 miles their is an abundant supply in rock-pools. I think there must be running water here for six months in the year. At 14*67, the “ tangi ” was so narrow as to necessitate the unloading of all the camels and the carrying of the loads for ten yards. This gorge remains narrow till the 16th mile is re iched, where it opens out, and we are evidently near the watershed. We just found room enough for our small camp. The road is quite unfit for wheels. It is extremely rough, and the country is a difficult one to run a line through. Camp to Kolegan. Date. No. of March. Route. Intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 2nd March 1899 8 Kolegan, 3,775 feet. 15-68 53*75 Upon leaving camp, we continued up the narrow nullah of the last two days’ march, and at *30 miles made a very sharp ascent to the watershed at *45 miles. This watershed divides the Bampur and Sarbaz drainage, and has a height of 4,800 feet. A sharp descent of a few yards brought us to the source of the Sarkaur river at 1-20 miles, and we follow its channel for the rest of the march. At this point, there were a few pools of water, which, gradually increas ing, form a stream of running water from the 2nd to the 6th mile, when it disappears sub lerre. The bed of the river in this distance is of rock, with deep pools, with high rocks on either side, and the going is very rough and trying. The Petak nullah joins in on the left at the 8th mile, while the Begab track, which branched off at the 13th mile in yesterday’s march, joins in again at 9T0 miles. A sweet spring of water, known as Muri Konar, is passed on the right at 9A0 miles. The river bed is full of tall tamarisk and debris, and the flood line is seen 9 to 10 feet high, which tends to prove the guide’s assertion that two days’ rain blocks the road for a week and that the river is in flood annu ally. At 12 miles, the high rocks give place to more open ground with low Mils. Leaving the torrent bed at 12’70 miles, we make a sharp ascent of 100 yards, and keeping along a small plateau, pass a graveyard at 13 20 miles, and again dip in n the river at 13*57 miles. At this point, there is a semi-circular dt Date filarcli 181 fte cros&gt;e 1 ®atUr i in a ai Mtlie usir isatl I if ao huts 1 I Mi and a« pre inhai Halt close age, am baz.

Emerging from this strait, at 13 70 miles, the halting place and water of Ispatki are passed 100 yards to the right, while at the 14?th mile we note the sharp rocky peak of Ispatki, also close to the right. Continuing down the tamarisk strewn bed, we leave it at 15'50 miles and strike oif to the right for a few yards and camp on the small Kolegan plain. The road was very rough in places, and quite impassable for wheels. We crossed the river at Kolegan and kept down the left bank for a mile, passing at ‘Tomiles the ruins of the anc entfort of Kaleh Zangian. The Cheman nullah joins in on the right bank at 2'63 miles. The going continues gravelly and good down the bed of the stream, which is rich in its growth of tamarisk trees. A direct road to Serbaz, over a pass, bearing 160°, branches off at 5'75 miles. Some fallow ground to the right, with a small hut to the left, is passed at 9J miles, and at 9'60 and 9 80 miles we note two graveyards. The Han- sanoo nullah joins in on the left at 10-76 miles. This is the nullah which branched off at 10J miles in march No. 2, and is the one said to have been followed by artillery. This is also Sir E. Goldsmith’s route, and, as he s-&lt;ys, it is not the usual one, and no better than the track I followed. Palm trees fringe the banks at 11 -70 miles, the place being known as Shehr Nodan, but there are no huts here. IMore palm trees are passed ar, 12 85 miles, on the left, Padok, and again at Pasan, which has a hut, 14'25 miles. These places formei- ly were inhabited, but owing to scarcity the people have gone to Karachi, The junction of the Gwai Mark and Sarkaur takes place at 15 18 miles, where we halt close to the old ruined mud fort. The Gwai receives the Nashkand drainage, and is said to be the route followed by artillery en route, from Magas to Serbaz. The hearing of this nullah from our camp w as^ 78 and that oi t re Sarkaur 4°. The nullah v'e have so far followed (30-85 miles) is known as the Sarkaur, but henceforth it is named the Serbaz.

The following are the names of the hamlets passed and the distances from Serbaz :— Right bank, 0'70 Machi Mehter; 1*25 Honak; T60 Dashdar; 2T0 Oureman ; 2 , 45 Aramkan ; 3 40 Parkan ; 4*10 Gorder; while at 6 45 miles the direct road from Bampur to Rask, which branched off at 5’75 miles.south of yesterday’s march, joins in on the right. Continuing, we have at 6-88 Bandan ; and for the next 6 miles the rocks rise too sheer and precipitous lo allow of even artificial terraces and to make space for huts. At 13'30, the Champ road branches off up the nullah of that name, and the date-groves of Dipakaur start here, the tents and stone and mud huts constituting the hamlet being passed at 13'70 miles. We then note at 1P65 Shomtak, 15 Gwasulkan, 16 35 Dezebogan, 17'50 Degerzamin, IS'dO Dipatan, which with Ziaret-Jah, our halting place, include all the hamlets on the right bank. On the left bank, we have— 50 Kondan ; 1*50 Chanee; 2-30 Mong; 2 80 Eith; 3*40 Kan ; 4T0Gouroo; 5 Anja ; 5 f 0 Shandoo ; 9 25 Peerdan ; 16 Aboudar ; 17*50 Jemadar; 18*^0 Lehabad and 9*50 Roodban. The bed of the river in which the road lay was very stony and rough ; and in such places as we had to strike the water the boulders were slippery and trying on the animals. Ziaret-Jah to Rask, Date. No. of March. Route. intermediate Miles. Total Miles. 6th March 1899 6 Rask, 1,845 feet. 18*14 107-77 The road on leaving Zinret-Jah keeps on the right bank of the Serbaz river for a mile, when, crossing a rocky ridge, it again enters the channel. The going, owing to large slippery stones, is trying to our animals. Heret is passed at 3 miles on the left bank, and half a mile further on the road bifur cates, the right track following the river down to Parood, with a bearing of 190°, while we take the left, with 150° as our line, and thus cut off a corner. We enter a range of low hills at 4 25 miles, and can see Parood lying a mile to our right. Continuing among low hills for 3 miles, the track leads down a small sandy nullah, which eventually joins the main channel at 7 miles. Our forward bearing is now 125°, and at 7*30 miles the large Kuh-i-Pashamag, some 12 ^miles distant to our left and bearing 55°, is pointed out as Sirdar Hossein Khan’s retreat. The hamlet of Shosgeen, with a species of mud fort in ruins, is passed at 8‘35 miles close to our right. The word “jungle ” is applied to some date groves and patches of cultivation which begin at 11 miles and end at 13 miles, at which point we leave the river to wend its way tb Peerzabad (Eeroozabad), bearing 125°, while we enter a range of low bills, bearing 155°, and after a short ascent espy the picturesque hamlet of Peerzabad, about a mile off on the left bank of the river, which here divides, the right branch sweeping round to meet us as it were and to clear a range of high rocky mountains, running at right angles in front, by their western side, while the left branch goes round the eastern side of the high hills. The path in the hills is^very rough, but we do not fare much better when we rejoin the river at 15'20 miles. For the next mile, we have precipitous cliffs, 200 to 300 feet high, on both sides. The Kasrkand road joins in at 17*60 miles on the right, and we here leave the river to traverse some undplating ground to Rask, which is situate on the left bank.237 b 7- 6*0 Prom Ziaret-Jah to Rask, the hills on eifW 0 ,m„ n. • smaller and not so rugged as in the previous marohAs ri T er m ? re 0 P en » miles, and since entering the hills on the Bampur plain^tho 0 , thlS , p0 ' nt ’ ]; 07 f in river beds for the most part, between hiVl, ^ 10 * ra °k has been tains, and is liable to become impassable at any moment ° US and r ° Cky moun ‘ Bask to Peshin.

We therefore had quite a mile of palms and cultivated valley to traverse before we turned to the east into a range of low hills, the actual entrance being made at 1-90 miles. The 2nd mile is registered opposite a small Ziaret hut on the left, and here the track bifurcates, the right path leading to Daptan, thence to Peshin, and also to Bahu Kelat, while we follow the left and direct road to Peshin. We wind about in the stony hills, and at 3 - 50 miles enter a ravine in which there is a profuse growth of Peesh. A short sharp ascent brings us to the top of the Kodar Kalar Zangian at 4-20 miles, and we continue along a plateau to the 7th mile, when we change our direction to due east. The going is still stony through low hills. At IQ-10 miles, we enter the bed of the Sereen Kaur, a left bank affluent of the Serbaz. This mountain torrent had several pools of water in it, as there had just been a heavy rain-fall. Leaving the Sereen Kaur at iri5 miles, we proceed up a small v;»lley, passing to our right at 1T70 miles a small Balooch encampment. A graveyard is passed at 14 miles, and a few yards further on we cross the Kabgander Kaur. Keeping along the valley and crossing a nameless torrent bed at 18 miles, we dually clear the hills and debouch on to the extensive Peshin plain at 18-80 miles. Away in the distance and bearing 118°, lying at the foot of a range of low hills, we can just see the Peshin fort, and make for it over a stony plain, where a good firm track exists. The branch road via Daptin, which left us at 2 miles, joins in again at 19 miles. The plain stretches as far as the eye can see to the east towards Mand, while its western limit is said to be Kasrkand. It is the parallel plain to the Bampur- Magas-Kuhak one, at a lower altitude, and of course nearer to the sea coast. We enter a low jungle of mimosa and acacia, dwarf palm and tamarisk at 21. miles, which somewhat resembles the Narmasheer, and which possesses superb camel grazing and an abundance of fuel. Water, however, appears to be limit ed. A second road from Daptan joins in at 25'30 miles. The first cultivated ground is noted at 26*20 miles, and at 26 J miles w r e enter a date grove, and cross a species of canal, and, emerging on to higher ground, notice the first batch of Peshin beehive thatched huts. Passing these at 26*80 and a graveyard at the 27th mile, we leave the mud fort and main village on our right, and, traversing a date grove, camp on the banks of a stream close to the hills.

A graveyard is noted at l*70 miles, and we here descend into a nullah, emerg ing from which we enter the Talag-i-Potag hills. ^ e negotiate a short, hut very steep, stiff and rough pass, known as the Godar Katera, at o'50 miles, which proved too much for two of my camels as they fell and had to be un loaded, and it was with great difficulty we got them on their legs again. A solitary mimosa tr 'e, known as the Kalegan Kaheer, is passed a few yards to the left at the 6th mile, and is said to mark the spot where a Baloochee was robbed and murdered. On the opposite side of the road, there is a small well, which generally contains water, but was dry when we passed. We are now in open ground and, passing a graveyard at 6*45 miles, continue over a good path till 8*40 miles, where a road branches off to the right to Bahu Kelat. We emerge on to the small Porkonook plain at 9 miles, and at 9*40 pass some cleared ground, which lias evidently once been under cultivation. The track now continues through mimosa jangle, and across the plain of Kandur Sunt, and reaches the huts of Kastag to the left at 11*50 miles. We continue to the end of the plain and, crossing the Kanagani Knur, camp on its right hank at 12T6 miles. Seah Kuh, a black rocky peak, bears 244° from our camp, which is surrounded by low dome-shaped slate-stone bills. The road, with the exception of 2 miles in the Rotag hills, is good.

Miles. 9th March 1899 9 Dazinbast, 865 feet. 1804 166*82 Por the first 2J miles of our march, the track lies in a narrow valley, sparsely clad with mimosa and Peesh, when we emerge on to the Mash Geneganee Gand, an open plain, on which were some Balooch encampments, possessing flocks and camels. These Baloochees were said to be migratory. The Poreganee Kaur is entered at 3*50 miles, and thick Peesh jungle is noticed here. We enter a range of low disconnected hills at 5*20 miles, hut the country again opens out at 6 miles, and a hill close to onr left is said to be Gogo. The Gheshtan Kaur is crossed at 6*20 miles, and, keeping on the right |bank we rejoin the Kaur at 8 miles, and following its course we go due east over very rough ground. On eit her side are sharp, rocky peaks running east and west, the valley being only 100 to 150 yards wide. Adainek menzil is passed at 10 '70 miles. This was said to be a regular halting place, and there was a good supply of rain-water when we passed. A narrow defile is met at 11*75 miles, and Gwain Zangian, also a halting place, is noted at 12 25 miles. The going since the 9th mile has been stony and rough, with a sharp descent. The track leaves the Kaur at 13 miles, and ascends on to a stony plain, which is traversed in a south-easterly direction, and along the right bank of the Kaur. At 14 miles, a bifurcation takes place, the track to the right going to Kalantoo, while we fol low the left, and at 14*75 miles again descend into the Kaur. GwarManzii, the boundary between Persian and Kelat-Baloochistan, is reached at 15 miles. Crossing the Kaur, we ascend the left bank, and find ourselves on a second stony plain. A good track for 2^ miles over this plain brings us to a small nullah at 17*60 miles, descending which we rejoin the Kaur at 18 miles, and camp in it at 18 miles. Dazinbast to Sunt-i-Sir. Date.

Total Miles. 10th March 1899 ... 10 Sunt-i-Sir, 200 feet 19 03 184*85239 From our ramp at Dazinbast, we kept down the nullah for the first mile, when we Left it by the right bank, and ascending on to high ground passed a graveyard at 1-20 miles, and taking a sharp turn to the right, or south-west, were among ow stony hills. The track was very rough and stony here, and passing through a defile at l - 70 miles, we were not sorry to emerge on to open ground at 2*50 miles, the going gradually improving, till at 5 miles it is good and remains so throughout the stage. At 5 75, we enter a Kaur, whicfTthe guide named Meskeen, and continuing down this we enter a range of low hills at 6 30 miles. The 8th mile is registered at the sand-hills of Kulmir Sunt, which are passed close to our right, and we here cross a small torrent bed. The road bifurcates at 9'50 miles, the left or easterly track going to Desht, while we follow the right, which skirts some hilis on the right and hears south-south-east. There are two tracks at 1L'75 miles, but these rejoin a few yards further on. The road is now somewhat stony. We nofe a small spring of sweet water at 12-30 miles close to the left, while at 13*80 there is a Ziaret, on the right, with a spring 100 yards off. At 16 miles, we descend into a valley, and°at 16*65 cross the Kasar Kaur, which contained a few pools of sweet water and where there were some Baloochee tents. We kept in this nullah till the 18th mile, when leaving it we enter some stony hills, and emerge from these to pass through the jungle that fringes the right hank of the Desht river. Entering the dry sandy bed of the Desht Kaur at 18’85 miles, we cross it at right angles and leave it by a high bank at 19 30. The bed from hank to hank at this point is ^ths of a mile, or 3fTT yards. Half a mile higher up, the river could be spanned in 150 yards, the right bank being some 50 feet and the left 15 feet at this point. The river bottom is of loose sand, and would prove troublesome to wheels. SUNT-I-SlR TO SADBEBAST. Date. Xo of March. Route. Intermediate Miles.

A sandy plain is entered at 2 50 miles, and we have on &lt;&gt;ur right a few isolated peaks, while our left is bounded by a range of low serrated hills, which gradually verge off to the east. At 3-90 miles, a migratory Balooch encampment of 10 tents is passed. Excessive rain had made the ground very sloppy, and we steered for the clump of date trees known as 8adr( bast, where we halted on high ground. The road we had just traversed was at noon under water, and quite a large stream flowed passed our tents. It was with some difficulty we got the camels along, and had we been a few hours later we should not have been able to get through. The road would be impassable to wheels after rain.

A range of low hills was entered at 4-10 miles, and at 4*30 we passed the Ziaret Peeshal to our left, the hill of that name bearing 88°. The Peeshal Kaur was crossed at 5-40 miles, and, continuing among low broken shell-covered hills till 7*10 miles, we emerge on to a plain, which we traverse in a south-easterly direction for 2 miles, when low disconnected hills again bound the sides of the track. The Gavook nullah is crossed at 9*45 miles. At 12T0 miles, we swing round some clay cliffs on our right, known as Gamare Sunt, and at 12^ miles are fairly on the desert plain which extends to Gwadur. From this point, the bearing of the left hammer headed promontory of Gwadur is 146°, and the Mehdi Kuh 119°. The Mejanee Kaur is reached at 17*80 miles, and at 18*40 the Akaroo river is only a few yards to our left, and here is the usual halting place. As we had had rain and the weather still looked unsettled, we decided to cross the river and camp on its left bank. A mile among sand hills brought us to the Kaur, which we crossed and camped at 19*51 miles. The road was good throughout, and fit for wheels. Akaboo to Gwadtjb. Date. No. of March. Route.

The first real sign of civilization—a great sign, indeed—seen for days is noted in the telegraph line which crosses the track at 2 miles. We again strike the line at 6 25 miles, and followed it into the Telegraph Office, passing the Eesidency on our right at 8*40 miles and the cemetery at 8*60. And glad we all were to have finished our land journey over desert and plain, mountain and vale, of 2,299 measured miles.243 28^ February 1899. Absowaran. Height 3,350 feet.

Rask. Height 1,845 feet. I could not get correct information for my gazetteer from these Baloochees, so have estimated the size of the villages. Rask has 100 mud huts, 500 people. The water-supply is plentiful from the Serbaz river, but it must be somewhat olluted by the dirty inhabitants of the hamlets higher up stream. There are lany date palms and a fair amount of cultivation. The heat in midsummer mst be terrific, as the place is practically surrounded by hills. The inhabi- mts are a half-starved, semi-barbaric looking lot, and are very ugly, especially lie women, who have large blue beads strung through the cartilage of the ose. Peshin must have some 300 Mud and Peesh huts with a total of 1,500 ihabitants. They are Baloochees and slaves of the Negroid type. Some of he latter have a magnificent physique. The Peeshinees have a bad name, heir two tribes of Rinds and Barrs being known as robbers and a wild, lawless et. There is extensive cultivation round Peshin, principally cereals. The oil looks rich. The revenue was stated to be 5,000 Krans, but none has been laid for 3 years. Peshin is quite the largest village met with between Pahra md Gwadur, and has a large date palm grove. A Hindoo merchant has a shop iere. He complained to me of the unsettled state of the country, and informed ne that several loads of his merchandise had recently been stolen between Kej nd Peshin, and that he could get no compensation from the local authorities. There were a few Balooch tents at Kastag when we passed, the inhabi tants of which lead a nomadic life. The water-supply is precarious from pools in the Konagani stream. The camel grazing is good, with an abundant sunnlv of fuel. ™ * Temp.—5 a. m., 74°; 1 p. m., 95°; 6 p. m., 83°. Dazinbast, like Kastag, is dependent on the rainfall for its water.

The section from Regan to Pahra has already been disposed of in the pro posed route for the Central Persia Telegraph line. We must therefore skip over this section, and again pick up the thread at Pahra, the most eastern point reached, and deal with the journey thence to the sea-coast at Gwadur. I Of the two routes which connect Pahra with Gwadur, my many informants declared that via Serbaz and Peshin to be in every way better than the more western track via Kasr Kand. The former route was accordnmlv followed. The first 15 miles from Pahra lead us over a barren plain, when we enter a range of close and rugged mountains, and follow the large dry bed of a winter torrent, with sheer and high rock on either side. Two marches are spent in these mountains before we reach the watershed at 40 miles, which is 4,800 feet. Alter a short but sharp descent, we strike the bed of the Sar Kaur and follow this river, which lower down is known as the Serhaz Knur, for the next 68 miles, where Rask is reached. The chain of mountains, too, may be said to end here, which gives us 92 miles of mountains. We now go practically due east for 28 miles along a level smdy valley to Peshin, which is easy. Between Peshin and the Perso-Kelat frontier at Gwar Menzil, 2 marches, we are again among low hills, and hence to Gwadur we cross a level sandy “Pat” plain. Such in a few words is the nature of the country between Pahra and Gwadur—a difficult section on which to construct a telegraph line. The track, a mere bridle path, is very rough in the mountains, and in one place so narrow was it that we had to unload all our camels, and carry the boxes for some 10 yards before we could re-load, while in another place two camels fell into a deep pool and partly submerged their loads. It is quite impassable to wheels. Following, as it does, for 68 miles the bed of the Serbaz river, which varies from 100 to 400 yards in width, this track is liable to be blocked for 5 or 6 days after rains. I noticed the flood-mark on the tamarisk trees in the river bed showed that there must at times be a depth of 9 to 10 feet of water. As the mountains are close, sheer and rocky on either side, and considering the great distance for which the path lies in the river, the possibility of securing a side route is precluded. The water-supply for the 40 miles from Pahra to the Serhaz Kaur is very uncertain. Serhaz, which only consists of 6 or 7 mud hovels, and a dilapi dated mud fort, is the first village met with, and is 69 miles from Pahra, and we could get no supplies here. Again from Peshin to Gwadur, a distance of 86 miles, the water, although plentiful when we passed owing to the recent- rains, is precarious from pools, and in a draught I question if any could be obtained. There are no villages in this distance, while we only saw some small migratory Balooch encampments. A reference has already been made to Sirdar 11ossein Khan, whose head quarters is Rask, but who is at present a fugitive in the neighbouring mountains. So long as this Balooch is a renegade to his government, southern Persian- Baloochistan must remain in a disturbed state. I was repeatedlv asked if there really was a Shah; also if, as we stated, we were not afraid of the hated Gajjars, why 'we did not assist the Balooehees to get b.ick their country. At Rask, one of the influential men who called on me said if the English build a telegraph fine through here, there is a chance of our losing the small amount of liberty which we now have. This was the first and only remark savouring of animosity to the line that I had heard throughout the whole of my journey. In fact, I could not fail to form the idea a^ I came along that southern Persian-Balooch- istan was in a state of wretched discontent, that it would require but a very gentle breeze to set the smouldering fire ablaze, and for the country to rise and have one more attempt to throw off the hated Persian yoke. Peshin r which is in Persia, has refused to pay taxes for 3 years, and this vear on the Governor of Bampur’s ijitimating that it was his intention to per il 7—63250 sonally come and collect the revenue, the Peshin Deputy let him understand that he would hud a deserted village on his arrival, and that if any damage were done to the crops open strife would ensue. Again, we must remember that it would be necessary to establish a Tele graph Office somewhere between Pahra and Gwadur, and Rask has been referred to as the best division of the distance, but when we note that the temperature of this village was 96° in the shade at 1 p. m., on the 6th of March, we may con clude that the summer heat would prove fatal to Europeans. Add to the above the fact that between Peshin and Gwadur, a distance of 86 miles, the line would run along the Perso-Kelat frontier—a sort of no-man’s land and I cannot but think that it will be admitted how very inadvisable it would be to run a line through such an unsettled and difficult country. I might add that Haji Mullah Dad Khan, the Chief of Rask, who insisted on accompanying me to Peshin and in seeing me, as it were, safely off the premises, strongly advised me to send back the Governor of Bampur’s camels, which had been placed at my disposal, by the Bahu Kelat route, as he thought the road I proposed to follow too risky for the camelman to return along alone. If it be desired to connect Pahra with the coast, there would appear to be a better chance of doing so by running down to Chahbar. Erom all local Baloochee accounts—which Unfortunately cannot be relied on—, the country appears to be more open. However, from what Captain Sykes says in the Third Journey Report, it is but little better than the route under discussion. In conclusion, I would most respectfully venture to suggest that the pre liminary survey be made of the country through Magas, Kuhak and Bela, with the view to keeping the Central Persia Telegraph line through this country in its south-easterly course to Karachi, as I feel confident that the result of the examination wi ll prove satisfactory, and will obviate the necessity of running the international line along the sea-coast.

I would propose that Bunder Abbas and Chahbar be our two ports from which to despatch the material to the interior. At Bunder Abbas, the stores for the line from Began to Kashan should be discharged and sent in proportion to— 1. Bam, for the section from Began to Bam and half Bam-Kerman section. 2. Kerman, for half Bam-Kerman and half Kerman-Bahramabad. S. Bahramabad, for half Kerman-Bahramabad and Bahramabad-Anar, 4. Yezd, for Anar-Yezd and Yezd-Kashan. At Chahbar, the stores for the line from Magas to Began would be unloaded and sent to Pahra. The local or minor distribution should, I think, be done by means of skeleton waggons or bullock carts from Kashan to Began, which would probably prove more economical, quicker and more satisfactory than by using mules or camels. Beyond Regan, the question of forage comes in, and camels would probably be cheaper here.
