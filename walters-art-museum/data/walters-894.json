Mubarakshah ibn Qutb was one of the 6 pupils of the illustrious calligrapher Yaqut al-Musta'simi (d. 698 AH/AD 1298). This manuscript, with a colophon signed and dated by Mubarakshah (fol. 432a), was produced in Ilkhanid, Iran. It opens with a double-page illuminated frontispiece of geometric design painted in blue, black, gold, and green (fols. 1b-2a). Additional ornamentation includes verse markers and textual dividers. The Qur'anic text is written in Naskh script in black ink with chapter headings in gold Tawqi\" outlined in black. The Persian interlinear translation in red Naskh likely belongs to a later stage of the manuscript's history, when it was rebound and furnished with new margins. The black goatskin binding has a gold-tooled design of a central lobed medallion, pendants, and cornerpieces with doublures of brown leather and filigree decoration. It probably dates to the 10th century AH/AD 16th.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/38669", "Keywords": "Arabic; Binding; Book; Calligraphy; Codex; Colophon; Illumination; Iran; Islamic; Koran; Manuscript; Persian; Prayer; Qur`an; Scripture", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Mubarakshah ibn Qutb (Iranian)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.559.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.559.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.559.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.559.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.559.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1507667", "ExhibIDs": "2533, 2289, 2713, 186, 579", "Images": "CPS_W.559.binding_ClsdTopVwA_DD_300.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
