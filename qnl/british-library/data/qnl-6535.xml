Viet., Cap. 94. Jurisdiction. As sanctioned by Treaties in Persia. 4th September 1873. _ Para. 1. In pursuance of the instructions of Her Majesty s Government, we have considered the best means of giving effect to the Foreign Jurisdiction Act m the Persian dominions and in the States and territories bordering the Persian Gulf. In so doing we have necessarily assumed, whilst dis cussing the provisions of the Orders in Council re quired for the purpose, that Her Majesty is em- poweied, by sufferance or usage, or under treaty stipulations, to delegate jurisdiction to her repre sentatives in the above-named countries. 2. So far as treaties are concerned, Articles 9 and 12 of the Treaty of Peace of 1857 limit Her Majesty's powers of jurisdiction in Persia to the extent to which they may be accorded to the most avoured nation, and these are to be found specifically defined by Articles 7 and 8 of the Treaty of 1828 concluded between Russia and Persia at Turco man chai. [ Vide also the treaties more recently contracted by Persia with other European Powers, and more notably with Germany, Articles 3 and 11 to 17 inclusive.] By sufferance and usage. Civil jurisdiction in Persia. Letter to Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, dated 18th Augrust 1862. No. 39. exercised under sufferance and usage is set forth in the 6th and 7th paragraphs of the Despatch of Government of India, No. 19, of 24th January 1870. As there described, Civil jurisdiction on the Persian littoral, at least, of the Persian Gulf, corresponds so closely with the actual conditions of the same jurisdiction ip i urkey, that the Order in Council which constitutes the basis of the one, may very readily be adopted to legalize the exercise of the other. In the interior, too, of Persia the privileges so acquired would seem to be as fully confirmed as on the Persian littoral, for, although it were true, as alleged in the Despatch, that ‘ the Russians, as the most favoured nation, “ ”° general power of entertaining civil suits ‘ in which Russian subjects are defendants,” they, the Russians, appear nevertheless to exercise such a power. On this point Mr. Abbott, giving the result of his experience at Tabreez, says that “ in “ civil cases the Persian Government would never “ think of interfering in a suit in which the defen dant w'ere a British subject,—they would look to “ the Consul for redress.” The inference is there- tore against the Russians foregoing an undisnufed privilege, though, as Mr. AbbotPs account of the practice of the Russian Consulate General at Tabreez is very imperfect, the fact ought perhaps to be certified by further inqufry. 14949. aCriminal jurisdiction in Persia. 4. As regards Criminal jurisdiction in Persia (based on sufferance and usage), though “not so clearly defined,” the assumption is that at Bushire the trial as well as the punishment of the offender, being aBritish subject or protege, and the prosecutor being a Persian subject, would be left to the British authorities. At Tabreez also a case is incidentally reported by Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran which justifies the same view of British jurisdiction. Her Majesty’s Consul General there having proceeded to try certain Greeks (British protegh) on the charge of maltreating a Persian subject, inflicted a fine upon the offenders. The Persian authorities, without objecting to the course taken by him, protested only against the inadequacy of the penalty. On the other hand, Mr. Abbott, in reporting on the proposed establishment of British jurisdiction in Persia, remarks that “ in criminal “ cases occurring between English and Persian “ subjects, the English might be condemned by a “ Persian tribunal, but his punishment would not “ rest with the Native authorities, who .would have “ to make him over to the Consul to be sent to the “ British dominions to meet his deserts.” He leaves it to be inferred thereby that jurisdiction in such cases, to the extent at least of trial, rests of right and in practice with the Persian authorities. 5. The value of the privileges thus assumed cannot be overrated, and (viewing the character of Persian administration of law, the nature of Ma- homedan jurisprudence, and the state of prisons in Persia) if prescriptively established, ought no doubt to be maintained undiminished. In the matter of the disposal and punishment of the convict in Persia, our rights would, in most respects, be the same as those we enjoy in Turkey, and, as being equally claimed by Russia, could not, we presume, be disputed. But in respect of recourse to a British Consular tribunal for the trial and judgment of an offender being a British subject, we apprehend that the exercise of this larger privilege (though by usage hitherto conceded to us in Egypt) may depend, more especially in complicated cases, where more than one foreigner (other than Persian) should be concerned, on common consent, and may be in defensible in Persia against treaty stipulations, or the practice of the most favoured nation. Incon venience might result from assuming authoritatively more extended powers than are arrogated not only by Russia but by the other European nationa having treaties w ith Persia. 6. In respect, then, to criminal as well as to civil jurisdiction, the Turkish Order in Council appears to us to be well suited to the circumstances of Persia, and in recommending its adoption accord ingly, we believe at least that there is nothing in its provisions to debar us either from using existing privileges in that country, or from participating under “ the most favoured nation ” clause, in any Precedents adducible. Case in point quoted, No. 25/201, Government of Bombay to Govern ment of India, dated 3rd October 1868. Letters to Foreign Office, Nos. 22 and 25, dated 7fh and 12th February 1866. Letter to Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, No. 1, dated 8th January 1866. Privileges involved. Application of Turkish Order Council to Persia recommended.privileges that may hereafter be conceded to other Powers. 7. The only matters which would appear to affect our recommendation of the Turkish Order are those relating to the proposed exercise of jurisdiction on separate conditions in different parts of Persia, and to the propriety or otherwise of conferring Consular Commisions on Her Majesty’s representatives in the Persian Gulf, which matters form subjects of dis cussion in the correspondence and documents before us. Proposal of Government of India to establish a single jurisdiction for all the territories bordering the Persian and Oman Gulfs, irrespective of the “ interior of Persia.” Despatch from Government of India to Duke of Argyll, No. 19,24th January 1873. Despatch from Resident in the Persian Gulf to Government of Bombay, No. 473/129, dated 22nd October 1870. 8. Of these, the first arises out of the proposal of the Indian authorities “to establish a single juris- “ diction for the whole water and littoral of the “ Persian and Oman Gulfs,and “ to keep the “ arrangements regarding the Persian shores quite “ distinct from those for the interior of Persia that where (as in the territories mentioned) the status of the Consular body, and the determination of the course of appeal and of the law to be admi nistered are common to the exercise of jurisdiction, “ unity of authority, whether local or controlling, “ and residing in one and the same Department, is “ the most pressing desideratum in all these re- “ gionsthat “ the general executive control should be with the Government of India;” and “ again, that “ the interior of Persia should be “ under the Minister at Teheran and the English “ Foreign Office, and the Persian shores under the “ Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Govern- u ment of India.” Appeals. Q ne preliminary question to be here decided is, whether, assuming the expediency of making appeal to lie from the Consular Courts located in the north of Persia to Constantinople, and the law to be administered English law, while, on the other hand, it were desired to make appeal to lie from the southern portion of Persia and the Persian littoral to Bombay, and the law to be administered British Indian law, with the Indian Penal Code, would such an arrangement be admissible ? Objections thereto. 10. For the rest, however desirable the course suggested by the Government of India, on the grounds that the towns and islands of the Persian littoral are almost exclusively ruled by Arab chiefs on the patriarchal system, without inte- ference from the Persian Government; that juris diction there has been hitherto exercised on the same footing as in the independent States of the Arabian littoral; and that the circumstances gene rally of the Persian littoral would justify the exer cise of larger powers than would, perhaps, be ad missible among communities having more defined foreign relations ; yet, to the adoption of such a course an insuperable obstacle, we believe, presents itself in the differing conditions which must influ ence judicial procedure in the several territories concerned. If, on the one hand. “ sufferance andusage’’were to govern jurisdiction in the indepen dent Arab States, while, on the other hand, in Per sia, Muscat, and Turkish Arabia, it were governed by varying and somewhat stringent treaty stipula tions, separate provision must probably be made for its exercise in each case. So also in respect of the Persian shores, as distinguished from the interior of Persia. Considering the jealousy which is mani fested hy Persian officials on all occasions of terri torial delimitation, and the exceptions which, on the Persian littoral, must still be made of the ports directly subject to Persian authority, viz., Bushire, Lingab, and, perhaps, (or, on occasion,) Bunder Abbas, we apprehend that distinctive arrangements might be inexpedient. The establishment of one and the same Order in Council throughout terri tories subject to the sovereignty of the Shah would, we think, be indispensable. 11. If one system of jurisdiction must be adopted for all Persia, it may be worthy of consideration whether Indian law and Indian appellate jurisdic tion should not rather be extended to the “ interior of Persia,” than that “ the Persian Littoral ” should be subjected to English law. 12. The next point to be determined by the proper authorities refers to the right _ pertaining to Her Majesty to nominate Consuls generally in Persia, or in the special case to issue Consular Commis sions to Her Majesty’s Political Resident and Assis tant Residents in the Persian Gulf. 13. The right is presumed to exist on the follow ing grounds,— &lt;: By the Treaty of Commerce with “ the Shah of 1841 our right to name Consuls in “ Persia was limited, but by Article 9 of the Treaty “ of Peace, signed in Paris in 1857, we are placed “ in this matter on the footing of the most favoured “ nation.—Our commercial relations with Persia are “ therefore based on the Treaty of Peace concluded “ between Russia and Persia at Turcomanchai in “ 1828, and by the 10th Article of that Treaty “ Russia has the right to appoint Consuls or Con- “ sular Agents wherever the interests of commerce “ may require their presence in the Persian “ dominions.” 14. Her Majesty’s right so based is, we conclude, perfect and unassailable, but if it were deemed open to question, from the contrary assumption would flow the alternative proposition that the Political Resident and his Assistants in the Persian Gulf should be vested, in their proper capacities, with the requisite judicial authority. To this proposi tion, however, unless the alternative be unavoid able, we are disposed to demur for the following reasons. The Resident and his Assistants are accredited not only to the Arab States but to Persia, and are thereby rendered subject to the provisions of our treaties with Persia and subordb nate to Her Majesty’s Legation at Teheratav The practice hitherto, in like cases, has been f&lt;f? Separate provision probably neces sary in each State. Arab Order in Council inapplicable to the Persian littoral, and one and the some system probably indispensable for every part of Persia. Under that system extension of Indian law to interior of Persia worthy of consideration. Right of Her Majesty to nominate Consuls in Persia. Memorandum forwarded from Te heran to Foreign Office, dated 1863. Grounds on which right is assumed to be perfect. Objections to the Resident in the Persian Gulf and his Assistants being vested with judicial authority in their proper capacities.The preferable course to issue to these Officers Consular Commissions. Despatch to Duke of Argyll, No. 19, 24th January 1873, para. 16. Letter from Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of Bombay. The Government of India recom mends that “ appeals from Gwadur “ should, as in the case of the Muscat “ Consulate, be to Bombay direct.” A Consular Commission ought, we presume, to be issued to the Political Agent at Gwadur. Despatch from Resident in Persian Gulf to Government of Bombay, No. 473/129, dated 22nd October 1870. In the Despatch of Lord Granville to the India Office of 10th March 1870. In the India Office Letter of 30th April 1871, and Memorandum of 5th May 1871, the opinion is expressed that the Persian Courts should be “ entirely independent of the Supreme “ Court at Constantinople, and that the “ Court of Appeal should be Bombay.” Despatch from Resident in Persian Gulf to Government of Bombay, No. 473 129, dated 22nd October 1870. confer on such Officers Consular Commissions, to wit, at Baghdad, Bussorah, Muscat, and Zanzibar. Hnally, these Commissions, being honorary only and accessory, and being so declared, need not withdraw the holders in any respect from the authority of Her Majesty’s Indian Government. Any more precise limitation of responsibility and restric tion of control in respect to every other Depart ment of the State, of which their appointments may be susceptible, are matters of detail within the com petency of the Crown. 15. For these reasons, and also because the Poli tical Resident and his Assistants would be called upon to exercise notarial and magisterial functions more notably in respect to the Merchant Seamens’ Acts, we share the opinion of the Government of India! that (i it would be safer and less likely to give rise “ to misunderstanding to give to the Officers in “ question the designations of Consul General and “ Consul, respectively, in addition to the titles of “ Resident, or Assistant Resident, or Political “ Agent, as the case may be.” 16. In order to relieve the Resident from being continually hampered with small causes, particularly at Bushire (our political relations around the Gulf of Persia and Oman being his proper and sufficient charge, and his absence from head quarters being frequent and protracted), it becomes a question whe ther his Assistants should not be vested with co ordinate jurisdiction, or whether appeal should lie, as of course, from his Assistants to himself. The latter condition, be it observed, does not obtain (or could obtain under existing Consular arrangements) in other parts of Persia; nor in Turkey, where appeal from every grade of Consular Officer is to the Judge at Constantinople only ; while from the Consular Courts at Muscat and Zanzibar appeal lies actually to the High Court of Bombay. 17. As regards the subject of appeal, the argu ments in favour of Indian appellate jurisdiction for all the territories bordering the Persian Gulf are that by far the greater number of our subjects in the region in question are. natives of British India, and the interests to be dealt with are British Indian interests, whether commercial or other, that the objections to making appeal lie from the Persian littoral to Teheran, and, a fortiori, to Con stantinople, are obvious. (Among these are the distances to be travelled over roadless tracts, and the inadequacy of the means of communication.) And finally, referring to the provisions of British Indian law as distinguished from English law, it is presumed that “the special provisions made to ' meet the peculiarities of social, religious, or other “ law or custom among the various sects and races “ of British India” would be more applicable to cases wherein persons of those sects and races should be concerned. 11949. B6 18. If, then, appeal to the High Court of Bombay were deemed preferable, it would follow that the law of British India, including the Indian Penal Code, should properly govern the provisions of the Orders in Council, both for the Persian littoral and the other States bordering the Persian Gulf, not even excepting Turkish Arabia (Koweit), if, as regards that province of Turkey, the terms of the Ottoman order could be modified accordingly. 19. We do not perceive that the law in question would be less suitable in all these regions than in India to British subjects of every denomination, or to the circumstances of the communities among whom it is to work. 20. Assuming now, that Her Majesty actually enjoys or may acquire rights of jurisdiction in Persia, there is a separate measure relating to Appellate Courts which we desire very earnestly to urge on the notice of Her Majesty’s Government, as even preferable to rendering the High Court of Bombay, as herein-before contemplated, a First Court of Appeal, viz., the appointment of a Judge or other Judicial Superintendent, having the requisite legal qualifications, with some experience in the practice of British India law, who should be commissioned as a Judge of Appeal, much in the same manner, and having moreover the same powers of session and circuit as the Judge for Turkey at Con stantinople. 21. As the supervision of this Officer would em brace Persia, Turkish Arabia, the independent Arab States, Muscat, including the Coast of Mekran, and also, if it were so desired, Zanzibar, we should re commend Bushire as a central position from which it could be most conveniently exercised. Through his agency, the certain and immediate execution of judgment, uniformity of procedure as of law, faci lity of reference, not merely for purposes of inves tigation and appeal, but for guidance and advice in doubtful and exceptional cases, and a general judicial control would be secured to Consular jurisdiction throughout the'wide extent of country referred to. It is presumed that this Officer might also fill the office of Assistant Resident at Bushire. 22. Assuming, too, that, on the establishment of British jurisdiction in Persia, no essential difference would be discernible between the rights, powers, and privileges accruing to Her Majesty in that country and those, pertaining to Her Majesty in Turkey, we would again express our opinion that the Ottoman Order in Council would form a proper and suitable basis for the Order in Council proposed for Persia. The said Ottoman Order embodies now the result of ten years’ experience in a Mahomedan country. It has been from time to time amended, and is again appearing, after a careful revision, simplified both in form and matter. The Order and the rules of procedure, formerly kept apart, are This Penal Code is intelligible and logical; the English Criminal Law is the reverse. Appointment recommended of a Judge for Persia, on same footing as Judge at Constantinople. In his Despatch, No. 53, of 30th December 1870, while discussing the desirability of rendering the Persian Courts independent of the Superior Court at Constantinople, and suggest ing that appeals should lie to the High Court of Bombay, Sir P. Francis sub mits that “ there is no advantage in “ giving appeals from Courts con- “ stituted as the Persian Courts must “ be to other Courts, such as that of the “ Minister at Teheran, who necessarily “ has no such special experience or “ aptitude in legal procedure as would “ offer any advantage in the admini- “ stration of justice.” To be stationed at Bushire. Ottoman Order in Council again recommended for Persia.now incorporated together, and this arrangement, though adding, in appearance only, to its bulk, con stitutes, we believe, not the least of its merits. To be entrusted to Mr. F. S. Reilly 23. The revision of the Ottoman Order having for adaptation. been accomplished by Mr. F. S. Reilly (by whom it was originally drawn), after consultation with Sir P. Francis, we should recommend that the pre paration of the Persian Order should be entrusted to the same person, whose previous experience and familiarity with details would enable him, without further assistance, to appreciate the requisite modi fications. These modifications would be consider able or comparatively trifling, according as the question of appointing a Judicial Officer presiding over a Court of Appeal at Bushire were determined. If, then, in any respect, the rules and regulations of the Ottoman Order in Council, relating to technical procedure in suits, should be found to be incom patible with British Indian law, though otherwise suitable, from their simplicity, for Consular practice generally, the changes desired in that sense should be pointed out by the Indian law authorities when the order is placed in Mr. Reilly’s hands, to be drafted for Persia. The attention also of the Indian Law Officers should be called to Division II., Sec tion 6, of the Turkish Order in Council. Territorial dependency of Bassidore. Despatch to Government of Bombay, No. 162/798 F.D., 8th September 1868, paras. 2 and 3. Despatch to Government of India, No. 25/201,3rd December 1868, paras. 4 and 5. Of Angaum. 24. Before quitting the subject of Persia, we desire to call attention to the somewhat ano malous condition of Bassidore, “ a station under the British flag,” at the western end of the island of Kishm, of which the nationality appears to be problematical. The nature of its dependency and the source of our tenure are set forth and defined by the Government of India as Persian and deriving from Persia. But this view was contested by the Government of Bombay, in whose opinion it were “ politic to ignore all connexion between Persia “ and Bassidore, and to regard Muscat as the sole “ Power from whom our right to Bassidore has “ been and continues to be derived.” On this point it does not fall within our province to offer an opinion, but it is essential that the territorial de pendency of Bassidore should be authoritatively determined, in order that British jurisdiction there may be referred either to the existing Order in Council for Muscat, or included as of course in the proposed Order in Council for Persia. 25. The circumstances of the island of Angaum, a British telegraph station, are similar to those of Bassidore. Our tenure of Angaum, however, is, it is said, fortified by the sanction of the Persian Government. In any case, we presume that pro vision for jurisdiction on either island would follow the decision in regard to the other. Angaum may be regarded as part of the island of Kishm. Other States of the Persian Gulf. The Order in Council for Muscat was issued on 9th August 1866. 26. The territories in the Persian Gulf, other than Persia and the dependencies of Persia, in which it is desired by Order in Council to legalize British jurisdiction, are those situate on the Arabian coast(with adjoining islands), between the territory of Muscat on the one hand and the territory of Koweit on the other, comprising the petty independent States of,— Ras ul Khymah. Shargah. Amulgavine. Egmaun. Debaie, Aboothabee. Bahrein,—island and dependencies on the main land. Wahabee Ports. 27. The powers and jurisdiction of Her Majesty within these territories rest on sufferance and usage entirely, and are more than co-extensive with those exercised by Her Majesty in the Principalities of Muscat and Zanzibar, which are in some degree limited by treaty stipulations. Add to this con sideration, that there are no Political or Consular Officers other than English accredited to the in dependent Arab Chieftains,—that there are no foreigners, being Europeans, resident, or likely to become resident, within their territories,—that the foreign trade with their ports is prosecuted exclu sively by native craft carrying the British, Persian, Turkish, or Muscat colours, and finally that the maritime police of the Gulf being actually in British hands, appeal is customarily made to the interfer ence or good offices of the British Political Resi dent on all the graver occasions of grievance suffered or inflicted by a foreign subject within the limits of the States referred to, it follows that the object and effect of the proposed Order in Council for these States must be simply to legalize the judicial acts of British Political and Consular Officers, neither to extend nor to limit the exercise of their jurisdiction. 28. The ports of the Wahabee Government are specified by the British Political Resident in his enumeration of the territories under his official charge, but we are without information as to the present dependency of those ports. They may fall within the category of independent Arab States (to which category, hitherto, we have practically held them to belong, leaving them to be directly dealt with by our Political Resident), or havirig in recent years been invaded, if not subjugated by a .Turkish expeditionary force acting by sea from Bussorah* they may be regarded as integral portions of Ottoman territory. 29. Referring, however, to the incessant political changes on the Arabian continent, to the doubtful and irregular control exerted by the Ottoman Porte over its ^w&amp;^-Arabian tributaries, also their virtual autonomy wherever the authority of the Porte is not ostensibly recognized, we submit that the defi nition of Wahabee territory is unnecessary. It ?iflust be sufficient for purposes of British jurisdic- Koweit is a dependency of Turkey, and falls under the operation of the Turkish Order in Council. Enumerated.

Modifications proposed in existing Muscat Order. 9 tion that this territory should be found comprised and generally enumerated within the limits to be prescribed to this proposed Order in Council as above stated, viz., the territory of Muscat on the one side, the territory of Koweit on the other. 30. As suggested by the Government of India, we are of opinion that the Order in Council for Muscat (being mutatis mutandis identical with the Order for Zanzibar) is the best suited by its terms and structure to the circumstances of the Arab States. It would be subject of course to the modifications which spring from the absence of any treaty obli gations to the latter, and from the assurance that British jurisdiction there, based on sufferance and usage, may safely be maintained as prescriptive, and does not need to be supplemented or fortified by the formal assent of the Chiefs concerned. 31. Touching the peculiarities and defects of the Muscat Order in Council, commented upon by the Government of India, if, as has been assumed, the jurisdiction authorized by that Order is “narrower than in Persia and other places,” this must be the consequence of restrictions imposed by treaty which, though hardly to be set aside in respect to Muscat itself, may be eliminated from that Order in so far as they should be found to affect the Arab States. Again, we would remark that, although British Criminal jurisdiction in the Muscat dominions is restricted by Article 4 of the Treaty of 1839, the Order in Council of 4th November 1867 (being nevertheless, it seems, 14 framed on the broader basis of sufferance and usage ”), contains a provision, Article 35, than which it would be difficult to find terms admitting of more comprehensive inter pretation. In Civil cases the independent Arab States, not being affected by the like treaty, the same Order in Council, in its application to them, would not be hampered with the limitations of Article 5, which obtain at Muscat. 32. Here also the varying bases of jurisdiction seem to bar the course proposed by the Government of India to include Muscat in a General Order in Council applicable to all the States bordering the Persian Gulf (excepting Koweit, “ if the existing “ arrangements regarding Turkey should not admit “ of modification,”) to which end it is suggested “ to modify the Muscat Order accordingly,” or, “ as the better plan, to repeal the Muscat Order entirely.” 33. The modifications, however, which, in con formity with the views of the Indian Government, are required in the existing Order in Council for Muscat, would be not less desirable in the appli cation of that Order as the basis of jurisdiction in the independent Arab States. These modifications refer more especially to the course of appeal and to the law to be administered in both territories. They are the same as those above recommended in the adaptation of the Turkish Order to the H949. C10 A Persian littoral (and, if practicable, to the interior of Persia and to Turkish Arabia), viz., to con stitute appeal in all cases civil and criminal to the High Court of Bombay, (or, still better, primarily to a Judge or Superintending Judicial Officer at Bushire,) instead of to England or to Constantinople, and the British Indian law, with penal code, the law to be administered instead of English law. 34. The task of effecting these modifications might be entrusted also to Mr. Reilly, to whom we would suggest the following amendments as desirable in the Orders in Council, to be applied to both of the territories in question :— 1st. The scope of British jurisdiction might, we think, be extended (as in the revised order for China and Japan) to British ves sels or the vessels of Arab States at sea within the limits of the Persian Gulf. 2nd. The penalty for non-registering, viz., loss of British protection within the dominions, &amp;c. seems to be of questionable efficacy. Liability to fine should be superadded, as in the Ottoman Order, at the discretion of the controlling Consular Officer, and some fur ther provision should be made (consistently with the new Act of Naturalization) against the attempt to repudiate British allegiance with the view of evading British jurisdiction, more especially in respect to the interdict on purchasing, selling, or holding slaves.' 3rd. With regard to the appropriation of fines, penalties, &amp;c., it would be expedient to give the Consul a general discretion to bestow the whole or part of the penalty in the form of compensation or damages to the persons aggrieved.* 4th. Referring to the difficulties of obtaining everywhere in the Persian Gulf competent assessors, it would be desirable that, in the exercise also of the larger powers assigned to them, Consuls should have full discretion to dispense with their services whenever wuthin a reasonable time assessors cannot be procured. Consuls should also have power (especially in cases where protected subjects are involved in the suit) to nominate foreigners to be assessors. 5th. Should a judicial Officer be appointed to Bushire, his powers of fine and imprison ment in the several countries within his jurisdiction might properly be enlarged to the extent prescribed in the Turkish Order in Council. 6th. No penalty is assigned in the Muscat Order for persons returning to the country from whence they have been deported. This offence, as in Turkish Order, should be punishable by fine or imprisonment, and, in extreme cases, at the discretion of the Amendments desired in Order in Council for Muscat and for Arab States. * This we believe will be given in the revised Ottoman Order.

The provision of the Turkish Order re ferring to offences against religion should be inserted in the proposed Order for the inde pendent Arab States, and’ in the revised Order for Muscat and Zanzibar. 35. Referring to the discussions marginally noted as to the classes of persons subject to British juris diction, this matter would seem rather to be one for supplementary regulation or instruction than for definition in the terms of an Order in Council. The extremest latitude that should be allowed may be hedged by conditions involving registration, the written consent, in doubtful cases, of the person protected, or, in the case of a foreigner, the recog nition, similarly declared, of the Government to which he may be subject. 36. But a large discretion must necessarily be left, we think, to the controlling authority, and Consular Officers should also, as recommended by the Go vernment of India, have power to “ remit cases to “ the Courts of the country when they consider “that justice can so be better done;” in other words, to abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction in such cases. 37. It only remains for us to report on the two other points submitted to our consideration, relating, the one to certain modifications desired in the existing commercial treaty with Persia, the other, to the establishment of mixed tribunals for the adjudica tion of cases in which British subjects are plaintiffs, and Persians (or other foreigners) defendants. 38. The first of these has been so exhaustively treated in the Despatch of the Government of India to the Duke of Argyll as to be now ripe for negotiation between Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran and the Persian Government, whenever, following the action of his Russian colleague, “ a “ favourable opportunity should be afforded for “ placing the whole subject before the Persian “ Minister, with a view to establishing British com- “ mercial interests upon a more advantageous “ footing than that conceded under the Treaty of “ Turcomanchai,” or whenever independently the occasion may be preferred of pressing it upon the notice of the Shah’s Government. 39. The attainment of the second point would fur-' nish an additional argument for making the pro visions of the Turkish Order in Council the basis of jurisdiction in Persia, but the discussion of it can hardly be matured without preliminary investiga tion of the working of the system now obtaining in the dominions of the Porte, and without examining, if it were possible, in association with the Persian Ambassador at Constantinople, the several codes (civil, criminal, and commercial) there in operation! It is very desirable, in the opinion of Sir P. Francis,.1 ! 12 that we should both be entrusted with that duty at Constantinople. 40. The advantages of the proposed measure, not merely in its bearing upon the interests of British subjects, but in educating Persian officials to a right sense of their obligations, and to the just and proper exercise of their functions, can hardly be exaggerated, and receive their best illustration in the effects produced in Turkey. Its success, how ever, we apprehend, must in the highest degree depend upon the sympathy and support of other foreign Powers having treaty relations with Persia, more especially Russia, and it would rest with the Government to consider whether and to what extent it might be expedient to invite combined action in its prosecution. 41. It will be remembered that the establishment of mixed tribunals strikes at the root ot the worst features of Mahomedan administration. They would supersede the influence and agency of the religious Courts. They would gradually undermine religious prejudices and obnoxious rules, and re move those anomalies in the law of evidence and other laws affecting the civil rights of Christians, which are too familiar to need comment, and which were found to be so pernicious in the administration of justice in Turkey. 42. But the initiation of this measure must neces sarily be postponed until the points we have sub-, mitted in regard to the principles and structure of the Order for Persia shall have been considered and determined by Her Majesty’s Government in England and in India. $ to: •'{j CD ® 5’ 1 .&lt; M ' ^ JltS'I .STB! iM'huotqofc ttrmirrtovor.} niCi^E '■ i'lis ,n{ .f.vi .({••• 1 $/. io 5S O Sd</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000e1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C93</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000e1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C93</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Report on the proposed Orders in Council for Persia and the States in the Persian Gulf'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1873/1873</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-06-09T22:42:47</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (6 folios)</extent><extent>This file consists of a single report.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at f 76, and terminates at f 81, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.Pagination: the file also contains an original printed pagination sequence.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file consists of a report on British consular jurisdiction in Persia and the territories bordering the Persian Gulf by Sir P Francis, and Sir Arnold Burrowes Kemball.It includes the following:treaty limitations on jurisdiction;civil and criminal jurisdiction in Persia;an assessment of different systems of jurisdiction and existing Orders in Council;suggested amendments to the Orders of Council.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Arnold Burrowes Kemball</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Jurisdiction</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000e1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
