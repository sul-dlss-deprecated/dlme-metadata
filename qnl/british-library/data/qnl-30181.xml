RUbblAN INTERESTS, (5), The new soviet Consul, NovikoV, has been sfiwing great interest in everything that has been going ©n, lie went to Dizful and Shushtar #n the 1st January* On the 9th he went with his Vice-Consul and his interpreter in a 'Drezine'* by rail to Bandar Shahpour, returning the tfame evening, after having had a good look at that depressing port and hob-nobbing with *ne of ihe Persian jetty-clerks, a Gilani called ?arrukh-Nia who j^emed to kn®w all about their arrival and to give them a good deal of help. He even took them out in the port motor-launch and to Bandar Mashur. On the 11th January he called on the Consul-General and enquired what all the commotion about the arrival of bheikh Abdullah Khaz’al meant: Mr* Trott having given him the general lines of the matter and expressed the opinion that there seemed to be no danger, he went at once tq the Governor-General, and asked why the town of Ahwaz was being surrounded after the fall of Khorrarnshahr* Believing Hie Excellency's reply as little as he had done Mr* Trott’s, he went off to Khorramshahr, and sent off lengthy telegrams to Moscow* He has also visited Khorramshahr on several occasions, being interested in the material now being sold from the various dumps: and has been enquiring about his going to Abadan. A teacher prepared to teach both English and Russian has also arrived and the Consul has sounded Col. Alborz about the opening of a school here, an enquiry which the head of police countered by referring him to the Ministry of Education, Novikov called at the Ararat Hotel on the 30th January asking them if they could nut up in future various visitors: on receiving a discouraging renly he applied similarly to the newxy onened hotel '’betareh Khirram', the proorietor of which agreed, after consulting the Persian police, PERSIAN OFFICIALS.

The following new appointments were announced during tne month: Shabdiz to be Governor of ArakJ^Sultanabad) in place ®f badegh Hejazi: Mobasser Raushan to be governor of Malayer: Hormuz Ahmedi to be Governor of ^urujird instead of bultani: and Dr.Hussein Marzeban to be Governor of Khorramabad* The first two appointments are considered to be attempts by the Minister of the Interior, Allahyar baleh, to placate the Soviets. Hormuz Ahmedi is a Bakhtiari who was previously lessee of Zaidoon, and who has served, several years ago, as head tf the Bakhtiari guards over the oil fields. The fourth appointment, at Khorramabad, is merely an announcement, as Dr.Marzeban has not yet arrived. (10) . Abul-Pazl bhahrukhi passed through Ahwaz on the 23rd January on his way to take up the post of Consul at buleimaniyeh and Kirkuk. (11) . • Hassan Ali Kemal Heduyat, Ambassador-designate for Kabul, passed through Ahwaz on the 23rd/24th January hoping to catch a boat to India at Khorramshahr. (12;. Mohammad baed Maraghe'i, former Prime Minister, passed through with members of his family to Khorramshahr and thence to Beyrout on the lOth-llth January. His wife is ill and is seeking treatment, and his younger daughter Mrs. Wallace is proceeding to join her husband, said to be in Vienna. (13) . RAILWAY STSRVIOTi;. A new service of passenger and goods trains has been opened by the Iranian btate Railways between Ahwaz and Khorramshahr, jn Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays of each reek. Mixed trains leave here at 7.30 a.m-. aarriving at 10,38 a.m., and return the same afterneon, leaving at 4.00 o,m. and arriving at 7,08 p.m. Only 3rd and 4th classes are pro vided for passengers. AGRIC ULTURAL. (14) . oatisfactory rains have fallen and local opinion considers that a bumper crop ought to result, unless the Karun rises so much as to flood large areas. It is even prophesied that there ought to be a considerable surplus of grain for export. Colonel Noel has continued to expand his operations at Hamidieh farm, and is proud of a record area (more thfn 6,000 hectares) under cultivation there, consisting of a great variety of crops, experimental and otherwise. Dr.btump visited him during the month and explored the possibilities of the irrigation scheme at bhushtar and also made plans for the erection of a brewery at that place for supplying the considerable needs of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company in beer.Colonel Noel U still waiting for a reply at)out the new lease of Hamiaieh, and it seems unlikely that he will get a satisfactory one unless things chang ’ 1 con siderably in the capital. He has discharged his^Indian staff under one month's notice, and is in great straits lor ready money, though he hopes to ha'/e plenty of money uhet: --he harvest comes in in three months# Mg), Apart from one or two petty robberies by Bahmai bad characters the tribes have been quiet. ?or the first time for many years all the principal Kuh Gilu tribal leaders came to Rehbehan, where the Consul-General, who happened to be passing through Behbehan at the time, saw most of them on the 15th January. They all appeared to be on very good terms with the local military governor Colonel pars-tabas, who showed himself well acquainted with all their complicated relationships, aspirations, and quarrels. Their chief anxiety seemed to be to get their rations of cl#th, tea, and sugar from the government, and in this Colonel pars-tabar supported them: though it seems quite clear that the chiefs were thinking of making a profit out of these rations rather than issuing them to their tribesmen. Most of them went out of their way to protest their complete loyalty to the Persian CTOvernment. The principal chiefs who came to see the Consul-General were Abdullah Zarghampour, Muhammad Hussein Zarghami Tayyibi, Muhammad Ali Khalili, Malik Mansur Bashti, Iskandar Charami, ^Muzaffar Anya i, Taj Muhammad Bahmai, an’d Zargham Ariya'i. The temporary and quite unofficial government of the Bakhtiaris by Jehanshah bamLam and Abul-hasim Bakhtiar at Izeh still continues, and the two young men are doing all they can to secure government sanction for this de facto arrangement. It seems unlikely that they will succeed, though the government, pre-occupied with other thingo, have said nothing definite. Colonel Af shar-oghl®u, who visited Izeh on this matter on the 16th January, took the^respons- ibility of telling them to carry on at present. r ut there are signs that certain kalantars, who were delighted to receive a few presents to start with, changed their attitude completely when the tv;# governors endeavoured to collect taxe-s from them. PARTIBb. ( 15 ), a young newspaper-editor from Tehran named Zarrabi has been endeavouring to revive the Adalat party, and the new SaTadat party has spent some effort in recommending various notables for membership «f the electoral committee which is to run the provincial elections in P hruary. It apoears that three persons, Haji bheikh Ali Ansaipyy Haji beyyid Muhammad Hussein Alavi, and beyyid Hussein ^mam, are to sit on that committee by more or le^s general consent: the first being a mujtahid, the second a notary piblic, the third an advocate, ^he other three seats on the committee will probably be assigned to local merchants but '-here is a good deal of difference #f oninion as to who will be the most suitable persons to safeguard the interests of the public as against the officials.

BRITISH TROOPS f EVA CUAT ION. (21). To almost everyone’s regret the British troops in Khuzistan disposed of all their assets and were practically ready to leave at the end of the month. Major- General bavory paid a farewell visit to Ahwaz and on the morning of the 25th February saw the leading personalities of the province. He first visited the Persian Officers’ Club where he was greeted with a salute fr#m an escort, and he said farewell to all the principal officers of the Khuzistan, Division,thanking them for their co-operation and friendly behaviour: Col. Afshar Gghlou reolied in suitable terms and after a good deal of photographing the General left in an atmosphere of great cordiality. He then saw the Governor-General, the head of Police, and several heads ef departments at the Consulate- General, and also the boviet Consul and staff, Similar friendly messages &lt;?f cordial good-will and wishes for the future were exchanged. (22) . One unfortunate incident has to be reported: on the 24th February a camp which had been sold to a con tractor who had not taken the trouble to arrange protection was invaded by a crowd of Ahwazis who thought they would see what they could pick up: when it appeardd that they might spread to a neighbouring camp an Indian soldier, to keep them off, opened fire with a .22 rifle and accidentally killed a woman, fiUSbIAN INTEREbTS.

The energetic Novikov invited a large number of local personalities from various parto of the province to his /party @&gt;- 3 - party on the 23rd Pehruary in celebration of the 28th anniversary of the inception of the Red Army. ihe Iraqi Consul and Vice-Consul from Khorramshahr came, and also xir. land Mrs. Xeelan from the British Consulate Khorramshahr. However &amp;&amp; apart from heads of departments very few local Persians and none of the Arab sheikhs who had been invited a»ame, Novikov seemed disappointed that the General Manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company from Abadan did not at end. ( 24 ) ^he Soviet Consul has been several times to Khorramshahr, and has also started a school for Persians wishing to learn Russian. The teacher is an elderly Caucasian named Memed Khalil&amp;v, who speaks fluent Persian, having been employed for some time in Gilan some 20 years ago in Soviet trading organisations such as Vneshtorg and Persazneft. He is 65 years of age, and he claims to have 35 pupilsi ( 3 ) T R I B E 6 .

(*) of No. 612 Field Survey Company) (26) . Jehanshah Samsam-Bakhtiari, who with Abiul- Qasim as his assistant is running the affairs of the ( Bakhtiari tribe, called twice during the month and endeav oured to obtain support for his candidature for the oi^icial cost of Farmandar of the tribe. He showed a letter from his father Morteza Quli Khan to the effect that the latter h«ped that Jehanshah and his dear friend Abul Qasim would be officially appointed and would succeed in running the tribe very well. Incidentally the text of the telegram fron the Prime Minister, Ahmed Qawam, dispensing v/ith Morteza Quli Khan’s services as Farmandar and assigning the affairs cf the tribe to the Governor-General of Isfahan for the present was produced. It seems that the principal rivals to tie two young men are the aged bardar Muhtasham and Amir Hussein Ilkhan. ( 27 ) # The principal Kuh Gilu chiefs left for Beabehan during the month. They were all to some extent disappointed at the amount of cloth, tea, and sugar rations they received, in spite of the fact that the Governor-General and the * an 6 Finance Director stretched a point&lt; ; *gave them their ment not only for the month of Bahman but also for Fsiana, which does not come to an end till the 21st March. Th ^ reason for their dissatisfaction is curious. The statistics on which the issue ®f rations is being made at present are. the figures which the tribe gave to the census department in Reza bhah’s time when conscripts were being taken from -hell: the total then shown was 25,000. The tribe now say that of course that was an absurd under-estimate, and should ha'.e been 85,000 at leaot. The question whether to is..ue rations for the excessof 85,000 over ^5 000 has been referred t« Tehran and no reply has yet arrived. It seems that the issue of the smaller amount has had a verygood effect and may have kept the tribe from their traditional predatory habits. Nevertheless it is sad to have to record that practically none of the rations ever reached the individuals of the tribe: the bulk issues were sold at a profit in Ahwaz and Khorramshahr by the tribal chiefs concerned. One result of this has been internal difficulties from certain disappointed ’’kcdkhudau '.- 4 ( • bhailch AMullah Khaz'al has written a letter from Kowait to this Ctntulate-General observing that he only came to his native country in the interests of democracy and Great Britain, and that what happened vras entirely the fault of the Persian commander.

To carry on for the oresent at lam- tdieh he has had to sell someof his stock and he may have to sell his crops in advance at a ruinous loss, LURIbTAN.

All the tribal leaders had gone back to their tribal areas by the end of March, It appears extremely likely that dissensions are about to break out between various members of the tribes, either over tne distribution of tea,sugar and cloth, or over family matters and tribal quarrels. Malik Mansur Baaht-Bavi and Abdul-.ah Zarghampour are reported to have gone to see the Mamaesa:i Khans with the object tof making some combination against vhe Qashqais: they thought they would meet Ibrahim 4&amp;wam (Qatram- ul Mulk) there but apparently he did not come.

The Khuzistan Agricultural Society is still running at a loss and with practically no money,* Colonel Noel has reported this and has done his best by correspondence to make the Persian Government come to a decision as to the future of the Hamidieh farm. Two or three ^commissions'’ have visited the farm without much tangible result. On the 27th llarch however one of the members of a ^liquidation committee' named Sar-Rishteh-Dar received definite orders to take over the farm from Colonel Noel: at which he was greatly embarrassed as he has little knowledge of agriculture and no desire to stay in Khuzistan during the summer at any price« Meanwhile Colonel Noel is carrying on, making enquiries ab«ut new strains of barley, about the prospects of cultivating an acacia which w r ill yield a perfume, and many other technical matters, (10) , Recent rains have been very copious and in spite of a certain amount of flooding crops prospects are very good and prices have begun to fall, LURIbTANo (11) ® Azemun, formerly director of the Finance Benart- ment at Burujird, left on March 12th for All Gudarz to take up the more responsible directorship there.

Neither he nor the Governor of D«rud had received any pay for f«ur months, COMMUNICATIONS. (13). Torrential rains on the 14th March cut both the main road and the railway between Ahwaz and Andimeshk. The cut in the main road was at the 'Sha’ur' crossing some 50 miles from Ahwaz: the floods ripped up several hundred yards of the concrete road and unseated without quite carrying away a reinforced concrete bridge, which is still being used but must soon be re-built. The railway-track was similarly washed away. Both road and rail were soon re-opened: the first tram passed on the 22nd March after some good work by the engineers. Lorries are also using the road, though the surface is merely dirt which has to be continually renewed to fill up the ruts. BL3CTI0NS, There is little to report %n this subject except that the elections at Ahwaz have not yet reached a formal end, ov/ing to the resignation of some of the members of the\J51ectoral Council, and to another difficulty - which is that’elected members of the provincial council have to possess, according to the law, a 'complete knowledge of the g . . /Persian language'.Persian languageThe Governor-General has referred hoth points to the central government with no result; he nays that there is nothing laid down in the present law as to proceedure when the Electoral Council resigns, nor is it stated how the candidate’s grasp of the Persian language is to ha ascertained (and in some cases it is far from being ’’complete’'). His Excellency is pessimistic about the usefulness of the Council: he feels sure that not one of the candidates cares for anything except his personal in terests. * PARTIBS AKD PRESS, (15) . A good deal of Tudeh agitation is reported,, From Burujird we hear of two Tudeh agitators called Nakhoda- zadeh and Burbur who have a house which they use as head quarters for their anti-British and anti-Oil Company^ pro paganda, but the governor does not permit then to make speeches* Fr*m Dorud comes a report that the well-known Ahwaz Tudeh orator, Ali Ummid (Omid) tried to make a speech there on the 9th March, but no one heard what he said be cause the governor sent two cars to the scBee with in structions that they should run their engines all the time with open exhausts. (16) . At Ahwaz meetings have taken place on most Fridays, usually outside the High School of the Ministry of Education (and therefore practically on our consulate site). (17) . A series of articles in the ’’Hahbar” newspaper by a certain Mansoor bhakki, said to be a doctor trained at Birmingham, accusing the Anglo Iranian Oil Company of ill- treating its staff, \ (18) . Of more parochial interest is an article against the activities of the notorious Farajullah Misbah-Fatemy (agent of Morteza ^uli Khan) published in the ‘’Arzhang’’ newspaper of Isfahan: it says that he gives himself out to be supported by the British and therefore draws the good name of the British into disrepute. A similar attack on the same came from a hot-tempered Bakhtiari pamphleteer called Turab bultanpoor: his argument seems to be that the Bakhtiari Khans do nothing for their tribe but simply exploit them. (19) . Jamal Imami-Khoi took some care to encourage and organise the Adalat party groups at Xhorramshahr,Ahwaz and Behbehan. He regards Bahadur Qanawati, his political agent at Behbehan, as one of Persia’s main hapes in the coming political struggle with the Russians. (20) . The pusillanimity of Persian politicians is well shown by an enquiry from the Moussavi family (hitherto great supporters of beyyid Sia Tabatabai) I asking whether now that their chief was imprisoned they should repudiate him, A JR ,A B S 1 (21). bheikh Abdullah Khaz’al (see paragraph 28 of February Diary) has again written to the Consul-General: his letter, dated from Koweit on the 21st March, says that he le obedient to his government and only wanted to get his rights; and that he retired solely becuase he thought it was in British interests to do so*educational^ (22) e The Educational Department held a reception on the 11th March arranged 'by students of the High School ■belonging to the English Society, A good deal of the programme of speeches, plays, and songs was performed very creditably in the English language.

FOREIGN OFFICIALS. ( 7 ), Capt. Baele, Belgian subject employed as fin officer in British service with the Iranian Railways curing the war, died suddenly 8+ - V: ioheh »n the 6 th April while engaged in inspection duties on the railway. He was buried at Ahwaz on the 9th April, the ceremony being attended by a large concourse mostly consisting of railway officials, vsho were evidently anxious to show their respect for the dead man and their appreciation of his good services. It resKiins to be seen how the railway track will last under a Persian inspector. (81, 0*1. Biver, Belgian Military Attache, vi-.ited .Ahwaz ®n the 28th April in order to settle the af ,virs of the deceased Capt. Bade. ff5I : TAN OFFICIALS . (9; f 0^1. Abdullah Rastegar, newly appointed cbiof of Police for Khuzistan, arrived on the 16th April and tdc over from Col.Mustafa Albors who v/as placed on the.-'list of officials en di spo nibi lite and left for the capital #n the 21st April. ' He* had'done good service and his departure ia o. great loss for us.~ 2 - (lb). General Muhammad Hussein Firouz, Minister «f Hoads, arrived from Tehran ®n the l^th April, visited Bandar Shahpour, Khorramshahr and Abadan, and re turned to Tehran on the 20th April. On his way back he left the train at Dorud and sent by road to Burujird, a distance 45 miles: this was apparently the only section of the roads which he personally examined: the rest of his journey was made in a special railway coach. One purpose, perhaps the main purpose, of his tour was to tell the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company that they ought to pay their workers more. It was a pity however that he did not see for him self the shocking state into which the asphalted road from Khorramshahr to Burujird and Malayer is falling owing to rain-erosion and complete lack of attention. (11) e Sasagar, head of the Hallway ad ministration of the s#uth, was transferred to Tehran and left Ahwaz «n the 28th April. He received an enthusiastic- send off which showed he had oeen very popular; bunches of flowers were dropped on the carriage as it moved off. (12) . . Amir-Ala’1, acting Minister of Agriculture, arrived from Tehran with a party of officials and proceeded to IChorramshahr on the 2Bth. He rendered a long report on the proposed barrage at Ahwaz, and also repeated to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company the good advice which Firouz had already given them, as mentioned above. (13) . Lt.Col. Gharib, a police inspector from Tehran, was here during the month, and visited Khorram shahr , Abadan, and other towns of the province in the course of his inspecting duties. An unsavoury scandal was un earthed by him leading to the arrest of Fatehi, the plain clothes detective employed by Col.Alborz, and hio secretary. (14) . Hhahshahani, a senior inspecting officer from the Ministry of Justice, arrived during the months and inspected the judicial arrangements of the prov ince. (15) . Lt.Col. Maikedeh of the Railway Police formerly at Andimeshk left for Tehran during the month. (16) . Other visitors during the month included Farhudi, deputy for busangird,Hasan,deputy for Kermanshah,* and fehe wife 3 f Hheikh Chassib Khaz’al. EDUCATION. (17) . To celebrate the end of the Edu cational Year the director of education on the 26th Aoril invited foreign officials to attend a play performed by the senier girls: it lasted ^or 2? hours and showed that Persian girls must be just as good at memorising and delivering eloquent torrents of platitudes as th«se cf the opposite sex. The Soviet Consul, with his wife and staff, and a number of local ®fficials and their wives, were present, CONTROL OF PRICES. (18). The Geverhor-General called a meeting of representatives of departments together with merchants and notables to consider the best means of reducing prices. Tariffs were drawn up reducing the price of a number of commodities by 25?,. The bakers however endeavoured to ont off these prices by lowering the wages of their staff, vix- /thereupon at X ■hit-' XV. O' ~ 3 ~ thereapon struck. A compromise figure was decided upon but even that does not seem to he observed yet. PROVINCIAL C OUNCIL. Tehran has at last solveo. she dead lock caused by the resignation of three members of the electoral college: the Governor-General received axiz.xOi^z.^ t* apooint three other members, and the scr-utiny of votes was practically completed by the end of the mcntn. ir.e difficult question of the meaning of ,r a peiuecs knowledge C f Persian^ (one of the requisites of a candidate; wab als* solved: apparently by Tehran saying 'Tnose who are e^ec -ea will do'. ^ 20 )o -he province has been quiet, apart from unimportant disputes between tribes on migration. Hornraz Ahnedi, the new governor of Burujird, has be?n try ing to clean up the town though the municipal budge- is almost entirely swallowed up by salaries cf the staff, he has als# been threatening butchers who refuse to lower the price of meat with flogging, a punishment which is s.h.li lawful, though that law is seldom applied. ur.&amp;iarze'rnn at Khcrramab&amp;d is trying to increase the area of cot 1 ,n under cultivation in that fertile district© ae uoeti .lot think that the prohibition of future cultivation of toe opium poppy will cause much disturbance, as vue peaB^-dt gets little out of it: but a great deal has been sovn already this year.

LAbHT-1-i.IIbHAN c The majlis deputy for that ar-a, parhudi, has been visiting his constituency, and on re turning to Ahwaz gave the following information,, Tis rice cryc- is pretty satisfactory, though ilocding n:s done great damage to the wheat and barley at Hawiseh© i-e new land-settlement is hanging fire, and temporary arrange ments have been made to prolong the status .qv:c for .he ore sent. A school for the sons of local sheikhs has “pp * 1 started at B^istan: thirty y*ung people are to be brought up and boarded there at the expense of the Lepartm^nt c-x Education. The local commander of Gendarmerie, wla.or Hussein Qasimi, is universally popular as he has tie un precedented peculiarity of not taking bribes© PARTIES © (22) © ‘ The Sa’adat party, which for rome un fathomable reason is associated with the Bntisn (perhaps because they themselves say so, or else because being opponents of the Tudeh party they are labelled Briciah by the latter) has published the text of a l*r&gt;g telegram which its members sent to the Pric e i'4:&lt; r.ieter asking him .c ,ower the cost of living and suggesting the following measures j.ut realising that object: (a) luv-ring of freight charges *r. the railway: (b) better ccr.trol of distribwion of eigar^ tea, and piece goods, (c) reduction in the gor- rrm^ni price of cigarettes, to correspond with lo^or real prices if tobacco in Persia and ^aper abroad:, and (d; increase of the sugar ration from 1/2 kilo ** o I kilo per ; n' upon© -he party called themselves f the !’&lt; presentritives ; i' ail ihe- habitants of Iduzistan'. In actual fact they are almost / ex c 1 u oil t. ;/- 4 ~ exclusively occupied in getting themselves elected to the Khuziatan Provincial Council* The Prime Minister replied on the 30th Ap*il promising appropriate action* (23) . Little has 'been heard of the Adalat party except that Bahadur Qanawati is still its active head at Behbehan, and that Hussoin Zarraoi, editor of a paper called ’’Eastakhiz-i-Ma' (apparently not yet published) published a broadsheet in favour of the new chief of police, Rastegar, when he arrived: this was prebably meant ae a dig at the departing Col* Albcrz* (24) . The Tudeh party, rejoicing in support from the government in Tehran, has been going from strength to strength* The scurrilous Tehran paper ,? Eahbar /? had a l»ng article an the 5th April from the pen of l '&amp; Khuzistan scholar'’ accusing, most local officials, especiaJ.ly the Governor-General (a ’product of the Baihtiari feudal system') and Col* Alborz (a suppressor of liberal ideas who ’'sur passes the German Gestapo”), of reactionary feelings and all forms of wickedness* The great centres #f reaction were Masjid-i-buleiman and Abadan: and its chief agents were Mr* Pattinsen, Mr. Trott* To 1*Noel, and 'major Jeacock# Abuse of landlords is reported as the theme of o meeting at Wais early in April as the result of which one of the chief local landlords was assaulted by hooligans* On the 5th, 12th,and 19th April meetings of the Ahwaz Tudeh party were held, partly on the waste land outside the High Hchool which forms part of the British Consulate site* The general argument was that the British were great obstructors of democracy, especially that evil man Mr*Churchi11: and cf course the oil company, backed up by venal Persian officials, was sucking the life blood of the province* After abuse of Seyyid Zia and the Adalat party the speakers usually ended up by saying that all the deputies of the next Parliament would belong to the Tudeh party* It was remarked that the publication of the Prime Minister r s carefully worded circular instructions of the 16th A.pril exhorting the public to respect the rights of others and not abuse freedom did not restrain the Tudeh party from the usual manifestation on the 19th April. In fact the speakers at that meeting recommended the workers of the Anglo-Ir&amp;nian Oil Company to stop working until their wages were increased* (25) . Abu Talib Bhirvani who has been in this province during the month engaged on Bakhtiari business, produced a booklet which gave the rules and aspirationsof a new party he is trying to form: it is called Radical- socialist * and is supposed to attract all elements of the public except rich men* who, Shirveni thinks, spoil any party. But he did not say whether the party yet consisted of any members other than himself* IJ.jLftAA ( 26 ) # The Bakhtiari tribes began their mi gration to the hills during the nsonth* Agjha Zhar, son of bardar Mohtashar*, cans tc the area and had ar; interview xith Jehanshah bamsam-Bakhtiari: and coon after it announced that the unnrecedentsc step c* creating a joint governorship for the tribe had been taken by the Oovernnent; the Joint rulers being Anix* Hussein Ilkhan (son of Sards.r Zafar; ano Abdul Qasim* They seem strange yoke-fellows* (27) . The Kuhgiiu tribes have been stealing as ustial, but nothing very much* Malik Mansur and Abdullah Zarghampur visited. Muhammad Hussein Takeri of the Boir Ahmed (Upper) in the Mam&amp;ssani area early in April but did not seeQawam-ul-ITulk, who excused himself on the grounds /that thethat the Governor-General #f Pars had heen changed, and that Naalr Qashqai was not in Shiraz, nor his brothers Khosrow and Muhammad Hussein, who had both gone to Tehran. Malik Mansur and Abdullah Zargframpur therefore returned. The former reported that there had been sanguinary fighting between a part of the Bcir Ahmedi under Alaquli Qayerl Givi and the barashuris. AGRICULTUEE . . : ’ / (28). The government prices for wlr-at and barley this year have been announced; apart from certain local variations they are 300 tomans per ton for wheat and 150 for barley. But the Government is not actually a buyer of barley, and seme is being offered for export to India*, (g9). The visit of the acting Minister of Agriculture resulted in the resurrection «f an old barrage scheme, originally elaborated by the American engineer Carroll; the Kanin is to be dammed at the rapids near the present railway bridge and its surface raised r/ metres, with the result that 100,000 hectares of land wili be brought under cultivation. Amir Ala ? i thought that the resulting taxes would justify the capital outlay wlich would 'oe about 40 million tomans. An increase ir. the capital cf the Shushtar Irrigation company was sanctioned at a meeting at that place on the 5th April« The original project had a capital of 5 million rials, one million af which was granted by the Shah. The capital is now raised to 20 million rials. The Governor-General was present and represented the Shah. (30) . Col. Noel, despairing after several visits to Tehran, is convinced that his schemes dor the future direction of the Hamidieh farm will net pe accepted nor a long lease authorised, and is preparing to leave the country, handing over the farm saddled with a large debt to a Persian official.

Short notes on some of the principal events of the month are as follows :~ May 1st. A holiday with full pay was declared by the AIOC, as the result of a request from the Prime Minister which was agreed to by the Company* Neither the Governor-General nor this Consulate had been informed and no Persian concern, nor the Imperial Bank: of Iran, closed, a fact which earned them some abuse* The principal event was a surprisingly well or ganised parade of workers at Abadan, shepherded by Tudeh. members decorated with arm-bands. May 5th. Strike of some 500 men in the distillation and asphalt plants at Abadan: settled by the Company acceding to practically all the workers’ demands. May 10th . Strike at Agha Jari, of almost all the 2,400 workers Well organised and controlled by Tudeh agents, with picketing and intimidation. May 16th . New scales of wages announced by the Company re- vising the basis of remuneration: rations of foodstuffs being abolished and pay increased to a minimum wage of 35 Rials per day - which means about twice as much money as the men previous ly received. May 17th . Incident at Bandar Mashur: woman died in child- birth: negligence by doctor alleged by the Tudeh- party. May 20th. Large meeting at Abadan, t^/ith inflammatory speeches. May 22nd*' Arrival of Committee of lour* persons from Tehran, with instructions to examine the whRle question of the com plaints against the Company: they visited Haft Kel, Agha Jari, and Abadan. • May 25th. Strikers at Agha Jari went back to work, the Com pany having acceeded to most of their demands, and referred the question of pay for the period of the strike to the decision of the commission: with the final result that the back pay was given. Labour trouble has been widespread over the who],© of the area of the Oil Company’s operations. It is not disputed by the Company that the accommodation available for the workers has been and still is inadequate, especially at Agha Jari:Bakiii-.j.api, seems to have J'ehaoshah seems to have &gt;. best of it and cease his died down, and the disappointa eon sensible enough to make to opposition.

V 22* On Friday the 21st June a traditional form of Arab exercise and recitation called a u yazleh M took place in the old town of Ahwaz, attended by about 1,500 persons* The performers recited poems in praise of Persian officials and expressing the hope that more would in future be done for the Arabs* A great number of the appreciative audience were already members of the Tudeh party, but that fact did not seem to deter them from enjoying what was obviously an anti- Tudeh demonstration* There was n® disorder* 35* There appears to have been Tudeh activity led by a man named Jadidi at the scene of Col Noel’s former activities Hamidieh and Ahu Dasht, but the result was negligible* &amp;4* The Governor General is embarr&amp;s^dd by these signs of Arab activity, directed though they are against his great enemies the Tudeh* He knows that the Arabs will want •omething in the end, and the question is whether he will be able to do,anything for them. The Governor General of eourae knows that a good deal of their complaints against the local officials, a poor lot of venal opportunists for the most part, is justified* However, the more the Arabs get the mere they will want* But union is a thing which has never yet been realised by the Arabs of this province* PARTIES* 25, The Tytdeh party has had things all its own way throughoutrith 3 month, as will have been understood from the foregoing paragraphs* Nevertheless it was a remarkable and encouraging sign that on one occasion at least the Tudeh asked for protection by the Persian troops against possible attack the Arabs* On the day of the Kasravi attack they ..also seemed anxious to rope in the Persian police save them from Arab attacks* Green leaflets announcing the formation of a #nion of Chauffeurs were circulated in the town of Ahwaz on the 23rd June, one being actually stuck dn the wall of this Consulate-General office*It/ is to be hoped that the Prime Ministers broadcast of the 23rd June, warning all men that no party ought to send representatives into villages to interfere between peasants and their landlords, helped to deflate the Pudeh ' still further* At any ratethe Police at Ahwaz managed to keep them from holding a public meeting on June 28th; on • •that day, a Friday, they contented themselves with issuing an abusive manifesto Pull of insults concerning members of the Oil Company (especially Mr Jeacook), the Sa’adat party,' and of course the Governor General, whom they have been pursuing so thoroughly that he was exposed to a hostile demonstrations at various stations on his train journey from Ahwaz to Tehran. The Prime Minister’s broadcast of the 29th June, announcing the formation of the new 'Demokrat' party, is also thought to have taken so%^ of thewind from the Tudeh sails* Nevertheless Ali Umii is still very active at Ahwaz, especially with the workers of the spinning factory and the oil company workers at Kut Abdullah: 'a few • Arabs of the Bavi tribe are venting personal spite against their Amery relations by spreading Tudeh propaganda among the ignorant Arabs of that tribe: and peaceful inhabitants of Ahwaz who attend the town cinemas are liable to be startled by persons jumping up between filsas add shouting^lons live the workers of Pam Hormuz” or 'Death to Misbah Fatemy” etc # The well known Russian agent Pavud, proprietor of the cafe in the public gardens, came round to the tables of hie clients on the 14th Juhe collecting for the strikers of the spinning factory* An orator called Khairkhah, fecently arrived from Tehran, struck a new moral note about prostitutes* . After daying how the Tudeh party would make tne blood—stallied lords of London and the oil magnates tremble., he waved ^his hand towards the prostitutes Quarter near^bj 1 and said ^and these are our women” implying that the oil company’s filching of Persia’s wealth/drove the women to that shameful trade* Regulations limiting the public appearance of prostitutes have even been drawn uo by the Tudeh and circulated in Ahwaz* The Tudeh still ’ seerr f to have plenty of funds: at Agha Jari the sum of ^? raanB iB Ba id to have been disbursed and strike nay ? &lt; ^ a ^ r spinning factory workers must have cost the party a considerable sum, as the factory did not in the end, pay for all the days lost* GBfciARIvUtiRIS* . ^ Col* Qal ’ eh- T 'egi, in speaking of ^nis regiment of '• Gendarmerie in this province, drew a gloomy picture of the rQtten material he had to deal with* He complained that Khuzistan was always given the dregs of the rest of the country, and that all officers and other ranks levied illegal tolls as a matter of course on everything they cou . even charged tolls at various places on government He was tr y in £. to c lear out thepe Augean stables, Iew ^ O0 ^ So should be remembered that, this f^lCh CU i ta ^ 88 a ^ wa ^ s ^ een in the unpopular province &amp;IQT AT AHWAZ AGAINST TH K KiiSRAVI SECT* 215v v 0n JuBe &gt; a Friday, a determined attack was made by a party of hooligans on four houses in Ahwaz, known to have been the residences of supporters of the party of the deceased Kasravi, whose iconoclastic views are bitterly resented by orthodox mcslems* No one was hurt but the ^on-entc of the houses and shops concerned were destroyed* One encouraging sign was the fact that the appearance of the police on the scene soon stopped the rioting* The ^hideh £®+ t L ac ° u f® d the s6 ' a dat party of instigating the trouble, out the latter establiohea a perfect alibi as they were /holding/holding a meeting at the times there is little doubt that the riot was caused 'b5 r a sudden outburst of fanaticism. It may well he, that Tudeh agitators joined in. and one of them, Eaissi, tried to make a speech during the pillaging of one of the shops. ANGLC-IKAKIAN OIL COIOPANY, 38o Various allusions to the difficult and nerve-racking anxieties of the company have already been made. At Bandar * Ma’shur with the help of the contractor Behbehani the Tudeh agitators failed to make much impression. At Dorquain a dispute with a well-known bad character named Bahrain about the return of his boiler-suit led to angry words after which ^ahram struck one of the British employees of the company. The Governor-General acted with promptness and sent an officer and some Gendarmerie to effect Bahram’s arrest. Unfortunately the gendarmerie went by road while two Tudeh representatives from Tudeh were flown to the spot from Abadan in the Company* s plane, and so got there first. It proved difficult, therefore, to get evidence but Bahram was eventually removed. The position in other parts of the oil-fields was one of uneasy calm. Thewwage increases which we understand represent a net increase in emoluments of about 40$ did not come into their full effect till the end of the month, and so threatening was the attitude of various agitators at Agha Jari, the ringleader of whom was a certain Hafizullah, that the company decided to evacuate the women and children from that area at the end- of : . June, An unfortunate incident on the 2€hh June added fresh fuel to the flames, A man was killed in an accident and there was no water available to wash the body, Mr.Goodall was roughly treated, and the Brigade Commander from Behbehan, 'Col,pars-tabar, who happened to look in, was forcibly removed in sight of some of his troops and sent back to Behbehan by car. The eomraanding officer ot the tenth division at Ahwaz is veryaworried about the position and is not prepared to take on the hooligans under Hafizullah unless he received precise instructions, Mr.Rice flew out from England at the end of the month and accompanied ?&gt;y Mr, Berthoud of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, made a tour of the oil areas and reported to Tehran, RUSSIAN POLICY, i $9, On all sides reports of the qctivity of the Soviet consul, Novikov, come in. The Arabs say that Russian rifles have arrived here recently in lorries. Revolvers are also reported to be distributed secretly. Novikov 1 s efforts to persuade the Arabs of Dasht i Mishun (Susangird) that the Russians loved them and were not against the Moslem religion: his Journeys to out-of-the-way places like Ram Hormuz, HindiJan, and even to Bushire in the fierce heat of the summer: and his efforts to have a private talk to the tribal leader Muhammad Ali Khalilinat Behbehan (who was on the side of the Persian Troops when they first went to Agha Jari last month) afford pretty good evidence of what Novikov is trying to do. On the other hand he seems not to have recognised or encouraged the Tudeh intriguer baghary when he met him at Ram Hormuz: and we have never yet been able to prove direct contact in this area between Novikov and the local Tudeh leaders.

PARTIES 19 1 &gt; The only tv/o parties who come into the picture at all have been the Tudeh and the Arab Union, and their story is inextricably mixed up with that of the strikes, dealt with below. The Democrat party was only heard of in this province, no branch being opened here: most of the If 3a f adat ,f group (it can hardly be called a party) and some of the Arabs telegraphed their desire to join the Democrats: and it is understood that both Hussein Gazi and Sheikh Haddad, the principal victims of the savagery of the Tudeh rabble on the evening of the 14th July, were among those who- supported the Prime Minister 1 s party in the hope that it would put an end. to the machinations of the Tudeho 30o One incident which shows the power of the Tudeh party may here be mentioned. On the night of the 8 th July All Omid held a meeting at Lashkarabad, a suburb of Ahwax, consisting of some forty non-commissioned officers of the Ahwaz Garrison. The erator proceeded to advise his audience to take an independent view and n®t be s# foolish as to obey the oriLers of their superior officers if they ordered them, for instance,, t# fire on a crowd.

Governor General in one conversation with the Soviet Consul. The local reaction to the Prime Minister’s move has been one of astonishment thatGhavam should go even one further than Reza Shah, with all his might, ever did: for the latter never announced that people must not frequent foreigners: he merely ensured that they did not, while maintaining that he had never prohibited visits. The present policy is the direct opposite in two respects: the prohibition exists, but is not enforced. PARTIES, 18.

T 'ovikov said that the Persian Govt ought to do something about it: Misbah Fatemy then began to allude to the outrageous remarks about himself which had been appearing in the Moscow Pravda, and Novikov changed the subject. 4. ^he Vice Consul, Po^iesinsky, with two others, left Ahwaz in a jeep on the 14th December bound for ^asrah: they were stopped at a military control post 20 miles down the direct road to Khorramshahr and made to return to Ahwaz as they had no permit: on applying to the divisional commander the latter demurred to issuing a permit as it was late in the day: ^ut to his surprise they said the^ could not wait till the next morning and insisted on leaving that evening.

Khosrow ^oir Ahmedi has figured a good deal in the Tehran news, as being ready to give his all in the service of the Government. He has been at Tehran, aid one of his followers, Muhammad ^aghi Khoobani, a ked-khuda of the Qaid Givi sub-tribe, has &gt;^een telegraphing loyal messages to the Government from nehbehan. It was largely through Khosrow that arrangements were made for contingents of Kuh Gilus to proceed to Tehran on the 10th December to help the Persian Government win back Azerbaijan. There were to have been 1,100 men inwall, composed as follows:- Khosrow ^oir Ahmedi 250, Abdullah Darghampour (his half-brother and rival) 250, Muhammed Hussein Teyyibi 250, Muhammed Ali Khalili “'ahrnei 200, Malik Mansour ^ashti 100, and Muzaffar Ariya’i 50. Arms, pay and rations were to have been supplied at Tehran. ''hit in point of fact none of these patriotic but quarrel some scallywags ever left Ahwaz, and the Governor General thinks it was just as well, as they would probably have caused more trouble than they were worthpi and would have been much more keen to fight one another than any enemy, Azarbai jani or otherwise.. 13. o r the 22nd December, in honour of the rehabilitation of Azarbaijan as a Persian province, a parade was held on the main street of Ahwaz, composed of troops, scholars from the schools, local Azarbaijanis, and Arabs from the vicicity of Ahwaz. ^he latter turned up in good numbers, nearly 2,000 of them riding nast on their ponies, headed by various bheikhs looking incongruous in lounge suits and horrAurg hats. a lorry load of ^a,. _ru^ Ir'busmen also went by at the end, as there had not been time xo arrange for them to bring their horses* ^he Arabs seemed in excellent humour as they rode by, tfctugh as they passed t^e Governor- General at the saluting point they were more inclined to turn towards the band, which was on their left, than towards the Governor General on their right. : APTIBM. 14. m he Democra't party opened a bra^ ch at Dizfoul on the 20 th December, aft.er careful propaganda and a speech by the Governor General i n person, a d many names were /inscribedinscribed, uf the ^udeh party there haa 'been no sign* on the surface, and'the announcement in the Tehran papers of the 13th December about the government’s decision to instruct the Military Governor to close the party in the public interest has been carried out in this province* all m udeh notice-boards having been removed. ^he United Council of Labour has also been proscribed. 15.

A mosque at i/Ias.jid i suleiman is also under construction, the company providing the architects and the materials and the pious workmen providing the labour. ''he town of Masjid-i-ouleiman is expanding rapidly, so much so that the ancillary services such as sanitation, roads, hospitals, etc., all of which ought to be but are not provided by the local government, are beginning to cost the company so much that they are thinking of gradually, reducing their commitments at Masjid-i-Guleiman and making Ahwaz* where there is at any rate a town and government machinery in existence* their principal field station. m he medical work at Masjid i Suleiman is so famed^that one patient was found to have walked all the way from Meshed to be cured-, ^he company’s doctors are doing their best to tackle the enormous problem of stamping out, or reducing, the two pri'ciple scourges of the peasantry, trachoma and venereal disease. 18.

The newspaper comments that Khosraw, a brave patriot, had a?ways been loyal, as distinct from his brother iibdullah Oarghampur who ’^murdered sever;.\l thousands of innocent soldiers at semi rum.

All of the favourites except Dr.Raji belong to the Democrat Iran party, and Dr.Maji is said to be prepared to accept membership. The position in Khorramabad is obscure: the new governor wazaffari having been confined to his bed with a fever, things go very slowly. In ^urujird a great struggle is in progress: voting actually started early in December, and according to Hormuz ntimedi (who appeared pn the scene to straighten things out when the governor Dr.He sabi had been bundled off to ^ehran) five-sixths of the votes were given for sultan ul Ulama and Dr. jibdul Huosein H’ tebar when an inspector n;uned Touliat arrived and seized and sealed the voting boxes, much to the delight of the losing candidates, jihu ^urab Razani and Qasim Muladvand. It appears that Douliat, who himself is a past member of the majlis from Mum, came from the aged and highly respected mujtahid ivgha Hussein ^uru.jirdi with instructions to help Razani and Fuladvand. ^he support given by the mujtahid to individuals in these elections is said by Hormuz Ahmedi to have been a surprise to his many disciples in 'birujird. Razani ouffered under the 'bideh period last summer, and he has been the organiser of the Prime Minister’s party here: b U t he has done (and is still doing) his best, without much ouccess, through his local paper ”Raz”, so one can hardly say he has' ’t had a run for his mo ey. 25. i-.t Arak the elections are declared over and Izzatullah ^ayat, with Hussein Makki (a publicist of doubtful reputation) have been declared elected, AMGLQ-IR.JvI^ I OIL COMMA] Y. 26.

Increases in the pay of the local police are announced as from the 22nd December last, senior officers are either allowed two servants or granted the pay of two servants (i.e. 2,160 rials per month) as an allowance* Junior officers get one half of that allowance, or one servant's services.

In continuation of paragraph 11 of the last Diary, the Quarrelsome brothers .Abdullah and Khosrow have made up their differences and have even been shooting together without damage to either. ^he beautiful Kashmiri shawls, not to mention the medals, which Abdullah and twelve other chieftains received from a grateful and appreciative government at Tehran in their recent visit seem to have deflated Khosrow, who did not go to the caoital.

It says that the British, in order to resist the spread of the Iran Democrat party, (which is pro-American) are now going to support the Tudeh party 1 ELECTIONS, 27. Everything seems to b e going according to the Iran Democrat plan. Niqabat has been warned off the field at Khorramshahr and Abadan, and Kamali/Abrishomker ^ndd have also given up the unequal struggle. At the end of the month the only Khuzistan seat not yet decided was that of ^ehbehan.

TRIBES. 5t The h$ads of the Kuh Gilu tribes have been, in Ahw^z where they have received their sugar coupons, enabling them to sell at a large price the cheap sugar which thcvy ought to have issued to their tribesmen. At any rat&lt;&gt; they have been quiet add the governments olan of keeping them quiet at the expense of their depone*:sntfe*. still works we]'' what will happen when sugar prices break i, ^ the gov ~' ..wAw^oly comes to an end i *3 not so clear. 6 6 , The. chief tribal news comes from the ^akhtiaris. Abul ^asim was at the beginning of the month at Ab-^id near Dizful and he sent out feelers for an interview with the Consul-General who declined to see him e Jehanshah at about the same time sent a letter to the Consul-General seeking his help as to the future policy of the tribe: his object no doubt being to get Abul pasim out and get himself in. Feeling in the tribe against Abul Qasim began to grow, largely .as the result of the enmities which Abul Qasim himself has aroused, and the Governor General seems to have been mcve*d to write him a letter suggesting that he had better ru]^ e the tribe more wisely. Abul Qasim however replied ' oy a rude and insubordinate communication^ which prompted *the Governor General to complain to the ■ Prime Minister a nd Abul Qasim went off to n ehran on 11th March. Howev/er, he was back again within a week and visited Ahwaz at the end of the month to confer v/ith his cousin ^gh^ xhan 'afcktiar who is now the elected majlis /representative2 repreafintatlve of the tri&gt;&gt;e. Agha Khan Inclinea to th« opinion that tribal opinion being what it is the only thing for the Goverivnent to do now is to appOintr^a eo- governor with Abul Qasim from the other branch of the tribe: failing that, he thinks the tribe had beat be ruled by a military governor. It ia quite certain that large number of the kalantars are in more or less open rebellion against Abul Qasim, and that fact has had an unsettling effect on some of the labour of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company. 7, m he goods robbed near C-atch iiaran on the 27th February (February Diary para 18) have ^een found and restored, according to the Governor General, ^he offenders are supposed to have &gt;een ''oir Ahmedis from the Forth, but it seems quite likely that j.lalik Mansur staged the robbery to show how necessary his presence is in those areas to keep the peace. PTC, 8 * The projected visit of four repreaentativee of the V/,F.T.U, to this area caused the Governor General &amp; good deal of anxiety. Having heard that Dr.Jodat, a notorious , agitator, was to come with them, he extracted a protnise 4 from the Minister of Labour, Aramish, that whoever came with them Dr.Jodat should not. In the end Mr.Harries came by himself on the loth March, made a quick inspectigfi # and went off to Isfahan. ^he other three members however did come after him, arriving on the 22nd March in a Special railv/ay coach not attached to the ordinary train, and containing Dr.Jodat and an even more undesirable agitator named Nateqi, who was actually wanted by the police for murder in the riots last July. It appeared that Dr.Jodat and Nateqi happened to be in the station when the railway coach was starting from Tehran: or so the Minister of Labour said. ^he Governor-General wen% l» person to Khorramshahr and told the two unwelcome Jlaitors to return to Tehran, which they did two days l£ter.

Exact details of the wage-increases which the Ministry announced the Compary had agreed to have not yet '^een received but the Tehran press announced with great satisfaction that they «C«.ld cost the Company another six million pounds per ■mxmum. The minimum wage for daily labour has '^een increased from 35 to 40 rials per day. The Governor- General, very hurt at not having been consulted, protested against any such increases on the grounds that they would only send prices up still further and that the present wage rates were quite high enough. He thought the Company would be much 'Hetter advised to devote the money involved to schemes for lowering the cost of living: but the Company have that matter very much in mind too, and are proposing to initiate a scciological department in which such questions will 'he related to other welfare matters.

The Governor-General is still of the opinion that tne increase was a mistake as the benefit goes to the shopkeepers. The reasons given for increases in local prices are, first, that there was an increase in Tehran prices which drew away corinodities to Tehran, secondly, mat merchants are hoarding because they take rumours of war seriously, thirdly that imported goods caiinot be obtained by local merchants direct because only Tehran mercnants are in a position to obtain a quota of foreign exchange.

An arrangement made three years ago whereby about seventy chieftains v r ere given military rank arid paid by the military authorities was terminated without warning or consultation. The brothers were toying with the idea uf adopting town life as private citizens father than risk the situation deteriorating d^til there were serious consequences. 10. Dissatisfaction with Abul ^asim ^akhtiar, Co- Governor of the uakhtinri with Manuchihr i\sad, son of the late oardar ^sad, seems to be coming to a head. The return of iTml .^asim from Tehran has led to a situation which has been exaggerated into an armed clash • but which appears to be as follows:- Amir ^ahman, brother of Jehanshah bamsam, previously co-Gcvernor, who wac removed in beptem^er 1946, decided to force the hand of the Government by denying passage to Government’s representatives so long as Abul Qasim remained Governor. He has raised his standard at Izeh, some 40 miles east of Masjid-i- buleiman, ( 31 ’ 50”, 49’52”). a certain Ali Llurad i.Iuzaffir is reported to have appeared with a party of horsemen at Gulgir half-way between Mas j id*-i-buleiman and Haft Kel and retreated on the Governor-General sending a v. T arning that tribesmen entering the Company’s area v/ould be fired v &gt;n by troops. Manu*hihr ii.sad reported in person to the Governor General. ^he latter is restricted by the fact that Izeh is outside the sixth IJstan. He has however asked the Compqny tr find quarters for Hanuchihr over a limited period at Masjid-i-buleiman. ^he Company are tinxious to avoid getting involved but have met the Governor’s request. jjnir ^ahman is said to be complicating the situation by putting out a story that the Company supplied him with tv/o lorry loads of arms. Dr.nakhtiari has gone up to intervene. Abul pasim is said to be at Chehar Mahal. ^he name of the son of the late oasiar Mohtasham, a khan of the ^akhtiari, is linked up with the affair. ^herpossibility •f duplicity by the authorities in Tehran cannet be ruled out. Abul qasim may have paid heavily to retain office 1 and, having served his purpose, nay now be jettisoned. 11. bheikh Abdel Kerim Zanjani was formally welcomed by the local authorities on arrival at Ahwaz on his way back to Najaf and a crowd of some 2C00 assembled. His movements were of interest to the Russians who had detailed individuals to travel on the same trains from Tehran to Khorramshahr. 12. It is reported that bheikh Abdel Kerim Zanjani interceded successfully v/ith the bhah and the Prime Minister on behalf of bheikh Abdulla Khaz’al v/ho has been in exile since his wild-cat scheme to seize Arabistan at the end 1945.

The title has been re-established to* four main areas, as follows; first, between the rivers Duz a»d bhotait south of ahushtar on a frontage of 20 miles. secondly, north-west of Ahwaz on the bhahuy river, on a frontage of 20 miles, thirdly, on the right bank of the Karun upstream ef Ahwaz for about 30 miles, fourthly, downstream of Ahwaz for about 90 miles.
