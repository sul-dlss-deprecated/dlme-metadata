No. of 1353 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, j/Awal, 11. 1353 August 22, 1934. From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannie Majesty r s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, 1 have the honour to invite your considera tion of the arrangement by which Consular Officers abroad grant visas for passengers to Bahrain, and collect a visa fee therefor. It is understood that these good offices are performed on behalf of the Government of Bahrain. I do not find, however, that the fees so col lected have been remitted to the Government of Bahrain, through yourself; and I would therefore enquire if it would be possible to arrange for this to be done in the future, preferably half- yearly. At the same time I suggest that such Consular Officers should be invited to deduct twentyfive per cent of the collected total, towards the re-imbursement of their official expenses etc. FoR 1 have the honour to be, Sir ? ervant, A the Government.Confidential . NOsC/764. Political Agency, jSaiirain, the 25tn August 1934. -e From*- To* - Worth isquire, .C.S., Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain. The honourable the Political Resident the Persian U ulf, Bushire* in Sir, Payment of visa fees collected by H.M*s Consul Officers for visas to travel to Barirain to tne Bahrain Government. 1 * I have'the honour to enclose a copy of a letter Nos365/lS dated the 22nd August 1934 from the hdvlser to the Bahrain Government regarding the payment to the Bahrain Government of visa fees collected from persons wishing to travel to Bahrain. 2. The request that 75,t of these fees should be paid to the Government of Bahrain is, 1 believe, a new one. I think that the idea originated ! n the arrangement previously in force in f Iraq that 75$ of visa fees were paid to tne f Iraqi Government. 3. I have not yet replied to th s letter as I cannot find any satisfactory answer to it In our files. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. / ^ 3 - I.C.S.
