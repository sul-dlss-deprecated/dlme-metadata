I received your letter C/365 dated 18th April during the ^ School recess, and replied to it from Kodaikanal. I do not know what has happened to it. In respect of your first letter I regret to say that I lost sight of it, as I did not % immediately answer it, and it lay in my confidential records forgotten. About Tarik - I consider that he is a thorough • C '&gt; - . \v . v. gentleman and he is liked and respected by all who came into » ' ' . w.i iJ ^ i ... . L 'J* .. contact with him in Vellore. When he first cane here Vellore was full up with offices evacuated from Madras and temporarily he stayed with the Collector, a Muslim 6fficer. He made a very good impression during his stay there of a month or two. From January he has stayed at the Police Mess. For the first three months there was an A.S.P. of five or six years service also staying there. The two got on well together. There was then a gap when Tarik stayed alone until two probationary officers were posted, an Anglo-Indian and a West Coast South Indian. I have given you this history of Tarik to show you that it has been difficult for me to assess Tarik's character from his general behaviour in any kind of corporate life. He is most respectful and amenable to discipline. He carries out small tasks allotted to him in a reliable and resourceful manner (e.g. charge of games in the Sub-Inspector^ School). He can be energetic, physically and mentally, when interested but one fault he must guard against is a fondness for leisure. His character has been shown at its best in the way he has behavea when his leave was refused. He has necessarily spent a very monotonous time in this small up-country town, and he was very anxious to have a fortnight's leave in Bombay during P.T.O. \ -VA Copy of letter No.RC/202-4/GA/43 dated the 10th September 1943, from the Inspector-General of Police, Madras, to the Political Agent, Muscat.

June, 1945, from the Government of India? {A* fcyCM' 2. Since Saiyid Tariq's return from his tour in the Dhahirah area, which was reported in the Muscat Intelligence Summary No.15 for the fortnight ending 15th, August, 1945, no post in the Muscat Government has been allotted to him and I have had several conver sations with the Sultan in regard to finding Tariq suitable employ ment. The Sultan T s view of his half-brother is that his poor knowledge of Arabic and his irresponsible attitude towards life make it difficult to give him an independent appointment of any importance and that the best arrangement would be for Tariq to be placed under the British Adviser who would be expected to exercise firm supervision over his work. To my suggestion that, until an Adviser is found for Muscat, Tariq might work with Muscat Levies under the Military Adviser, the Sultan replied that he did not feel that Major Hirst could effectively control him. As an alternative to this I suggested that, as the police arrangements in Muscat and Matrah left much to be desired, Tariq might make use of the police training he had had in India to conduct an examination on this ques tion and to draw up a report with proposals for improvement. The Sultan accepted the suggestion and as soon as the Id celebrations are over, intends to instruct Tariq accordingly. 3. I have not yet had an opportunity of assessing Tariq f s worth for myself but am expecting to take him with me on a shopt tour to Sur shortly in order to get to know him better. 4. ^y own view is that the Sultan's suggestion that his brother should be placed under the Adviser is a good one, but that in the mean time it is of the greatest importance that Tariq should not be allowed to stagnate.

Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur, half-brother of the Sultan, returned to Muscat on the 7th after completing his administrative training in India. The Sultan has not yet made up his mind how best to employ this formidable looking relative and it seems that for the present his need for an educated and qualified man to assist him in the affairs of his Government is in serious conflict with his distrust of one who is no true believer, is more at home in English and German than he is in Arabic, and whose sophistication leads him to doubt .Saiyid Tariq 1 s ability to settle down in the narrow and rigidly moslem atmosphere of Muscat. The Sultan recently admitted to the Political Agent that the impression he had formed of his heIf-brother when he saw him this year at Bombay, had been disappointing. His Highness said that he had been forced to administer Saiyid Tariq a severe reprimand in connection with his prodigal spending of money. He had found considerable difficulty in getting Tariq to take this matter seriously and had been particularly enraged by the light-hearted way in which he has asked for a substantial sum to cover his debts. Saiyid Tariq has now been despatched on a three weeks tour covering part of the Batinah, the Wadi Hawasinah, Ibri and Dank and on his return, is to be married to the daughter of Saiyid Nasir bin Hamud al Said of Rustaq. Extract from Muscat Intelligence Summary No.14 for the period 16th to Slit July 1945. 227. Reference serial No.206 of 1946. Reports show that Saiyid Tariq 1 s tcUr is proceeding satisfactorily and that he has been well received in the Dhahirah area. The Sultan has spared no expence to make the tour a success and Saiyid Tariq was ^ven 5000 dollars for presents to the various Shaikhs. The party is expected to reach Sohar shortly from where the return to Muscat will be made by car. Extract from Muscat Intelligence Summary No.15 for the period from lit to 15th August, 1045. 247. Reference serial No.227 of 1945. Saiyid Tariq reached Sohar on the 13th and arrived in Muscat on the 15th. The Sultan informed the Political Agent that he was in every way satisfied with the results of the tour and in* particular with the enthusiastic manner in which his representative had been received in allthe places he had visited. This is the first time for many years that a representative of the ruling family has visited Dhahirah area.mm r 1^0 (2) Extract from Muscat Intelligence Summary No.17 for tbe period from 1st to 15th September,1946. • • • • 276. Reference Serial No.206 of 1945. VVhen he visited the Political Agent on the 4th, the Sultan again discussed the question of finding suitable employment for his half-brother, Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur. It was suggested to His Highness that Saiyid Tariq might make use of the police training he had received in India to overhaul police arrange ments at Muscat and Mutrah and this suggestion was accepted.m- 3i'/ / L.O.Mo.141-S. Confidential Persian Gulf Residency, Bushlre, 28th January 1946. 12/ I have Just seen your demi-official letter iVo.6^-P. 16/45 of the 8th June 1946 to Burnett about ^aiyid Tarik. I think you will be interested to hear my Impressions of him as a result of my recent visit to Muscat, I found myself next to him at a tennis match ana had an opportunity for a long conversation with him. He impresses one favourably, and appears to be sincerely grateful for what has been done for him. At the moment he is in charge of the Muscat kunicipality, where he is showing great zeal, if not much discretion. He has /.» now fitted in quite well into the Arab life of Oman, and no longer hankers after the outside world. 2. The Sultan has made no attempt to give him any military command, in fact Hirst told me that the Sultan considered that whoever controlled the Levies controlled Muscat; this may f , however, be the voice of Hirst and not the voice of His Highness. I see you mentioned that on two occasions he accepted invitations to the Residency and failed to turn up without sufficient excuse. He has apparently been late at more than one function given by His Highness who was naturally infuriated at such unusual behaviour. He seemed, however, fairly well disposed towards the young man, and whatever emerges from all this training he cannot, at any rate, say that we have not done our best for him. I feel that the Gulf Residency owes you a debt of thanks for the trouble you took over him in Baluchistan, which will, I am sure, have a lasting influence on his career.
