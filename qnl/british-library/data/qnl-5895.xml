The Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u a h i r e. Sir, Bashiyeh and Fad&amp;aghlyeh garden caaes o I have the honour to inform you that acting on my advice apparently His Excellency the Shaikh has appointed Messrs. Yacub and Artin, two lawyers of Basrah to represent him in future in all matters connected with his properties in Iraq. 2. I had heard that His Excellency had come to this decision sometime ago, and before your recent visit to Kuwait, but I only received confirmation of this fact from His Excellency personally yesterday (24th January 1933). 3. As far as I can gather both the gentlemen bear fairly good reputation, and are considered to be the best that Basrah can produce. 4. It is significant that both Messrs. Yaoub and Artin conducted and won the case against the Shaikh in the recent w Bashiyeh t, proceedings. They have now apparently withdrawn from the 'Bashiyeh' case altogether, and have taken service on the side of their late adversary. Under the terns however of their new agreement with the Shaikh, I understand that they will take no 'sides' at all, should further developments occur in the 'Bashiyeh' case. This after all is only proper.- 2 - n\ L? 5 # As regards the suit recently filed against the Shaikh in the matter of the fadd&amp;ghiyeh case, His Excellency tells me that there are no further developments at all, and that his having won over the advocates who were to have appeared for the other side, appears to have had a useful effect. 6. Although it is early as yet to day anything definite, it would appear as if there was something in my original suppositilon and the Shaikh’s helief that the whole unsavoury business was worked up by certain Basrah lawyers with the object of making money out of the Shaikh, and that having got some of the principal actors on his side, the Shaikh has for the time being at any rate left the other side 'guessing'. *7, I understand that Messrs. Yaoub and Artin get a monthly salary, irrespective of results, e useful way of % adding to their income. So The above is forwarded for information only.

Sir, &lt;ith reference to your despMch Ho.672 of Jeceiiiber 2nd, 1932, regarding the situation which has arisen in regard to the legal title of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s properties ’Iraq, 1 hare the honour to report that a law suit in respect of the Shaikh’s Faddaghi^ah Estate was filed in the Basrah Court on the 20th October, 1932, and this Embassy has now received certain legal documents from the ’Iraqi Ministry of foreign Affairs with a request that they be forwarded to Kuwait for service on the Jhaikh. These documents include a statement of claim made on behalf of the plaintiff, Abdullah ibn Isa Pasha al mhnir* ^rom this it appears that the plaintiff claims by inheritance from his aunt, Ayesha, a third part of the whole plot known ns the Faddaghiyah date garden, on the grounds that there never was a legal conveyance of the land to the Shaikh of Kuwait. He declares that the Tapu deed of registration granted to the Sheikh by Sir Henry Dobbs in 1915 was granted illegally, and that it is, therefore, voidable and should be set rside. 2. I am advised both by my Legal Secretary and the Judicial Adviser to the Kmistry of Justice, that, if the suit goes forward to judgment, there is a grave danger that the bhaikh will lose tiie action. From the report made hr.^lexinder, the President of the Court of Appeal, last summer when he was acting as Judicial Adviser, it would also seem that he is of the same opinion, since he states * 1 can therefore say that it is doubtful whether the Jhaikh can successfully contest the cleim.” i/ Right Honourable Sir John iimon, G.C.3.I., K.C.V.O., etc. etc. etc.I s '9 r I will not trouble you here with the complicated legal arguments by which this claim might be promoted or rebutted* but i think it relevant to enclose for your perusal a copy of a letter sent to the Agent of the Shaikh by A.r* (now Sir henry) Dobbs in his capacity as evenue Commissioner at Basrah in June,i9.to. From the terms of this letter it would seem the requirements of the fapu Law were recognised but that in the peculiar circumstances then obtaining it was decided to ignore them* Had the registration subsequently been validated by a proclamation by the Army Commander, X am advised, all would have been well, but without legislative cover, it seems difficult to resist the contention of the plaintiff that the fapu deed of registration granted to the Shaikh in 1915 was void ab initio* 3. The actual wording of the undertaking given to the Shaikh in Colonel '''nox^s letter dated the 3rd November, 1914, was rs follows: ‘0 &gt; ’’that your gardens which are now in your possess!on,viz. the date gardens situate between Fao and ^urnah shall remain in your possession and in possessi n of your descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes.” It will be noted that the wording used is wide enough to cover gardens in the possession of the Uipikh even if not in hia legal possessio , and whether this undertaking legally binds His majesty's Government to recompense the Shaikh for the loss of hia garden under the present circumstances or not, it is certain that he will look to Hia Majesty 1 s Government for compensation, if in fact they cannot prevent him losing possession. In such p-X] event his moral claim will be a strong one. I have, therefore, given the matter ray most anxious nnd careful thought as to what action, if any, I should be justified in taking with the ’Iraqi Government to protect the Shaikh’s interests.**3- i Pdviaed that the only certain means to prevent an adverse judgraent being given against the Uiiaikh would be to induce the ’Iraqi Government to pass legislation declaring tnat the Tapu deed of registration granted by Sir Henry Dobbs was in all respects valid. Apart from the difficulty of persuading the ’Iraqi Government to put such a measure to Parliament, there are obvious disadvantages in associating His Majesty’s Government with such p representation. The request would, in effect, be a request that the Iraqi Government should step in and destroy by law a private right for the advantage of one party in a pending suit. On the other hand, it can be argued that, apart from legal technicalities, a bona fide sale did take place, and that it would be nothing short of a scandal if the Hhaikh should be dispossessed of his property after twenty-four years quiet enjoyment. I should, of course, stress this aspect of the matter with the ’Iraqi Government in any representati ns 1 might make, b tthe disadvantages which 1 have outlined appear to me to be so weighty that I feel that 1 should not be justified in asking the ’irnqi Government to pass the necessary legislation except on explicit instructions fro m His Majesty’s Government. 5 # I have considered also whether apy attempt could be made either by the Shaikh or the ’Iraqi Government to induce the plaintiff to set le this action out of court. It seems that the plaintiff is without means, since in his statement of claim he lias applied for a postponement of payment of the court fees until after judgment. It is possible, therefore^ tnat he would be open to an attractive offer. 1 do not, however, view such r solution with favour, as it would encourage other claimants to initiate suits. From information before me, I am led to believe that the plaintiff is being instigated and supported by a group of speculative lawyers, who would be likely to hold out for the maximum amount obtainable. Another disadvantage of this course is tiiat tne Shaikh and the ’Iraqi Government would almost certainly look to His Majesty’s Government to fo.t the bill.v -4- ! 6 # There remains the question whether the shaikh could in law claim immunity from process in the civil courts in ’ Iraq. On this I am advised that ’Iraqi law contains no provision excluding foreign sovereigns from the jurisdiction of the ’Iraqi courts* and* although* until a test case is heard* it is not possible to give a definite opinion* it is considered almost ce tain that the courts would maintain a right to jurisdiction in all cases concerning title to immovable property situated in ’Iraq. Moreover, it should not be overlooked that the shaikh submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the ’Iraqi courts in the suit brought against his Bashiyah estate. 7. If, after considering the gr&gt;ve objections to such a course, His Majesty’s uovernment are prepared to instruct me to request the ’Iraqi Government to validate the Tepu deed by legisla tion, I feel that the only wad in which I could make the proposition at all palatable to the ‘Iraqi Government would be to undertake that, in return for such action, His Hajesty’s Government will abstain from inviting them to contribute to the sum that may be paid eventually to the Shaikh as compensation for the imposition of the ifchtilaz tax. liven so 1 am advised that it ould oe almost impossible to obtain the consent of Parliament to such a measure. I fully recognise that the political effect of the dispossession of the Shaikh would be deplorable, and that it is most desirable, as a matter of courtesy to the ruler ol a neighbouring State, that the ’Iraqi Government should arrange that his property rights in ’ Iraq should be rendered unassailable. I confess, however* that short of monetary compensation, I am unable to see any practical means of disposing of this unfortunate case. 8, Jf 3 regards the disposal of the judicial documents now in my possession, i propose to send them on to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, together with a copy of this despatch. 1 feel I cahnot advise the political resident at this stage as to whether the Shaikh should be encouraged to accept or dissuaded from/from accepting service. Refusal of service will certainly delay matters, but cannot indefinitely defer judgment, since * Iraqi procedure is elastic enough to provide for other iorms oi substituted service. Since, however, it will be infinitely more difficult to obtain any redress once an adverse judgment is in being, I should welcome any methods resulting in delay. the same time, 1 am inclined to the view that, although full conoidera. tion is being given by His ma jesty’s Government to his delicate position in the matter of the impending action, it would be advisable for the Shaikh himself to take the best possible legal advice that he can obtain as to how he can best defend his own right s.

But the fcludir oi Tapu in an order dated 9 Sh&amp;bat 1324 refused to register the sole owing to orders received from Constantinople, that no more sales of land in the name of the Shaikh of Kuwait were to be registered. After this you aod Abdul Wahab went before the British Consuijat Basrah and privately registered before him a deed of sale ol the ’.state - in so far as the holdings of Ahmad Pasha and Ay sabs were con cerned. Nothing was registered before the British Consul as regards the holdings of Abdul Jdagi and Shafiqe snd. her daughters * and minor son. i bdul /ahab received from you the balance of the pu chase money vJU. £T 33706 and handed the Bat ate over to the Jihaikh of Kuwait, in whose name it stands in the Muhasibi registers, though not jn the Tapu registers.

There remains tne question of the shares of Abdul Ba 4 A and Shafiqa and of her five daughters and minor xsju son.

Sir, * » V/itb reference to India Office letter No.P.E.706^/o^ ol sceived La e. 25tE November last, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a despatch? from His * Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad in which he reports that a law suit in respect of the Shaikh of Kuwait's Faddaghiyah estate has now been filed in the Basra Court and discusses what steps should be taken to meet this new development. 2. Sir John Simon is of opinion that, until the advice of the Law Officers, which is about to be sought on the whole question, has teen received and considered, no final decision can be reached as to the course of action to be pursued by His Majesty’s Government in this matter; but it appears to him important that in the meantime every endeavour should be made to j delay this suit against the Shaikh of Kuwait going forward to judgment, and he recommends that, with this object, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should be instructed to withhold service of the judicial documents emanating from the Iraqi Court. 3. Apart from the fact that such action would seem to be called for on general grounds of expediency, there is a constdera tion of principle which renders it particularly desirable that His Majesty's Representative should not consent to act as agents/ 5 Under*rSecretary of State, India Office. (copy sent to India)• • agents for the service of these documents on the Shaikh of Kuwait. His Majesty’s Government have throughout contended that the Iraqi Government are under definite obligation themselves to honour the undertakings given to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in 1914. and it may still be necessary to test the validity of this contention before the Permanent Court of International Justice. For example, if the Law Officers advise ■‘■■hat His Majesty’s Government are legally liable to preserve the immunity of the Shaikhs both from taxation and from dispossession of their property. His Majesty’s Government might well consider it advisable to adopt the course of action which was contemplated in 1930 and to claim their right to refer to the Permanent Court the question whether this obligation is one which has also become binding internationally on Iraq. So long as this possibility exists, it is important that no action should be taken by His Majesty’s Government or their Representatives which could be construed as being inconsistent with their view that the responsibility for implementing the pledges given to the Shaikhs in 1914 rests with the Government of ’Iraq. Sir John Simon is advised that the execution of service of the documents emana-ting from the Basra Court by the Political Resident might if carried out without any official protest by His Majesty’s Government, prejudice the case of His Majesty’s Government in this manner and, subject to the views of Sir Samuel Hoare and of the Treasury, who are also being consulted, he would suggest that the Political Resident be instructed to defer service of these documents pending the receipt of further instructions. 4.

It would be desirable that the statement that the Sheikh, as an independent ruler, is unwilling to accept the service of judicial documents emanating from Iraq courts should be made after informal reference to the Sheikh. For your own information I am to explain that His Majesty’s Government are not yet satisfied, (particularly having regard to the fact that the Sheikh appears to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Iraq courts in regard to his Bashiyeh property ) that it would in practice be possible to maintain the position suggested. But the primary interest at the moment is delay and they see no objection, if the Sheikh is prepared to take the line indicated, to the reply to the Iraq Government being of this nature. Hon’ble.The Political ssident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. It will not/n not be overlooked, in the same connection, that the absence of any protest by the Sheikh at this stage against the jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts might well render it difficult, if not impossible, to take this point on his behalf should it on other grounds appear desirable to do so, at a later stage in the discussions. 3.

I do not think stka that we ever imagined it likely that an Army Commander’s TYoclamatior existed expressly validating Dobbs’ action in registering the Shaikh’s property in *fapu. Nor, I think, did we imagine that this registration was other than ul tra vires if judged by the ordinary Minicipal Law of Iraqo 3* But it seemed to us probable that, during the military occupation, the ordinary Municipal Law of Iraq m waa to a large extent in practice suspended, and it occurred to us as / possible|that ttricsr in carrying out the registration of this property and others, Dobbs was acting under the general authority of some proclamation which authorised him, in his capacity of Revenue Com missioner, to carry out transactions of this character. Presumably/ J.G. Laithwait e , Ksq. ( r *he India Office, London)-Vesuma'bly there must have heer some Army -Proclamation 0 v v'hich appointed ^ohbs as Revenue Commissioner and which indicated the nature of the duties which he was + o perform in that capacity. If so, and if the duties defined included property registration without stipulating that registration must be in accordance with the old Ottoman Law, then it might, %ve are inclined to think, be successfully argued that ''art rill of the Iraqi Constitution could be construed as validating his registration of the Shaikh’s property. 4o It occurs to ne that the India Office, who were responsible for the affairs of Iraq at the time when the property was registered, may possibly have copies of the Army Proclamation or Order appointing Dobbs to the post of Revenue Commissioner and defining his duties. If you think the labour justified, perhaps you would have this poin* looked into. 5o 1 am sending copies of this letter and enclosure to Woods and to Stuart King. Yours sincerely. SP/ J .

(1) Does the Iraq Constitution •provide a m e ans for estop~ping the Yaddaghiyah suit ? '''he difficulty is that Sir Henry Dobbs’ registration was not done in accordance v/ith the law which he himself was administrating (i.e. the old Ottoman m apu Law) and on his own admission (vide the terms of his letter to the Shaikh of Kuwait dated the 14th June 1915) 0 As pointed out 7 I&gt;in our despatch Ho. 43 of 19th January, had this registra tion fcmra subsequently been validated by an Army CommanderJ proclamation, all would have been well; for Article 114 of &amp;9Dtx the Constitution would apply and the validating proclamation would be a part 6f the Iraqi corpus juris. But if, as it seems, Sir Henry’s act was ultra vires at the time, it remains ultra vires, since nothing has been done to remove the taint and the Court would be bound to upset the registration. 'The wording of the last sentence of Article 115 of the Constitution quoted by Mr. Hall is certainly wide, but to what acts do they refer? The Hollowing: (a) the suppression of hostilities; (b) the establishment and consolidation of order and public security; (c) the carrying out of orders issued in accord ance with martial law between 5th November 1914 and the date of the coming into force of the Constitution. Could ♦he above properly cover the establishment of a psrivate proprietarv title? I think not.( 2 ) ?h e p oe s i bil l tv o f the Sh aikh obtaining corrrpensa - tior? fro m the heir s of the vendor. Mr Hall states the position correctly* The Shaikh’s remedy would he against the heirs of the vendor, not against the present plaintiff who claims as an heir of his aurtt Awwashah, who, it is alleged, never authorised the sale or benefited by the proceeds. Mr. Drower has promised me to try +o find out who the heirs of the vendor are and what is the financial position.CONFIDENTIAL.. The Political Agency, Kuwait. No.75. Dated the 20 th April 1933. From Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C # I # E., I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait. To The Hobble the ^Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Faddaghiyeh Gardens Law Suit. I have the honour to forward translation of letter No/fe-2/893, dated 2 nd Dhil Hujjah 1351 (28th March 1933) which I have received from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait on the subject of the law suit which is pending in respect of his Faddaghiyeh properties. 2 . The letter speaks for itself. 3. For your information, His Excellency recently called his legal advisers Messrs Arteen and Yacub (See my confidential No.15, dated the 25th January 1933) frcm Basrah, and put them in possession of all relevant papers connected with the original negotiations and sale of the Faddagfriyeh Gardens to his grandfather, the late Shaikh Mubarak, as it seemed only proper and right that his lawyers should be made aware of the history of the case from its commencement. 4. His Excellency also asked me to show and explain to his lawyers the voluminous correspondence, which exists in this Agency in regard to the original purchase of the Faddaghiyeh and the difficulties which were put in ShaikhShaikh Mubarak’s way by the Turkish authorities in ^asrah. This I did although I, naturally, allowed no document to be removed from my office records. 5, As far as I could gather from Messrs Arteen and Yacub the Plaintiffs in the Fadda^iiyeh suit intend to take the line that Aisha bint Abdulla Chalabi as Zuhair, the property original owner of the Faddaghiyeh/never granted a Power of Attorney to her husband iJunad Pasha bin Qasim as Zuhair to sell her property in ^asrah to Shaikh Mubarak nor did she authorise such sale and that unless the Shaikh of Kuwait can produce a copy of such Power of Attorney, the original sale should be declared null and void. In other words Messrs Arteen and Yacub assure me that the case is going to stand or fall the production or otherwise of the do cument^ in question. 6 . Unfortunately no one here can apparently lay hands on the original or a copy of this particular Power of Attorney, although clear reference is made to it, in the actual sale deeds, which were drawn up between Abdul Wahab Pasha al Qirtas, acting for Ahmad Pasha bin Qasim al Zuhair, and Shaikh Mubarak, copies of which are on recored in this Agency. 7. As there appears every reason to suppose that this particular Power of Attorney did exist, Messrs Arteen and Yacub suggested to the Shaikh that he should try and get a copy of same from the Old Turkish Records Office at Constantinople through His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora. They added that if such document could be produced the whole case for the prosecution wi^l fall to the ground and their opponents would withdraw the suit. 8 . I should be grateful, provided you see no ob jection to such course, if a copy of His Excellency’s let- ter to me on the subject couid he passed on to Hi „ on to His Majesty’sMajesty’s Ambassador at Angora, with the request that steps be taken to obtain a copy of the document in ques tion at as early a date as possible. I presume there would be no difficulty in this. 9. I might add that I have taken pains to impress on Messrs Arteen and Yacub that His Excellency the Shaikh has already refused to accept any service of documents issued fey the IRAQ Courts in respect of the suit which has been filed in the matter of his Faddaghiyeh estates, and that they (Messrs Arteen and Yaoub) were in no way to fee led into defending the case without specific orders to that effect. Their role for the present was to wathh and advise only. 10. I said the same to the Shaikh, who assured me that his lawyers had precise instructions to do nothing unless instructed by him. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, ^ ^ Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait- 2 Translation of a letter No.R-2/893, dated the 2nd Dhil Hujjah 1351 (28th March 1933), from His Excellency- Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. -oOo After compliments, With reference to the verbal conversation which I had with Your Excellency yesterday morning regarding the question of our 'Eaddaghiyeh' property. My lawyers at Basrah recently asked me for all documents (sale deeds, title deeds etc,) connected with the abovementioned property, which my late grandfather Shaikh Mubarak as-Sabah bought from Ahmad Pasha bin Qasim az-Zuhair according to the Power of Attorney which the latter got from his wife f Aishah bint ’Abdullah Chalabi az-Zuhair, and which was issued by the then ^adhi of the Court of GALATA, Constan tinople, one Mustafa Kadhim Eff,, on the 15th Ramadhan 1326: My lawyers stated that they desired to study the papers so as to be fully cognisant with their contents, and to this end I forwarded all relevant documents in my possession to them. They, however, again wrote to me asking me to send them a copy of f Aishah’s Power of Attorney to her husband, but I replied instructing them to enquire from the Basrah Courts, where they mi^it perhaps be able to find same recorded alongside with Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair’s Power of Attorney granted to ’Abdul Wahhab Pasha al-^irtas. After making a careful search they informed me that they could only find a mention of the date of the Power of Attorney required, and that this was quoted in the Power of Attorney given/* * * . . «• 2 / b -tv given to ’Abdul Wahbab Pasha al-Q,irtas. An actual copy of the abovementioned Power of Attorney (the missing one) could not, therefore, be obtained, and the Attorneys consider it a matter of great importance, that they should have such copy before them. The above being the facts I would request you to be so good as to write to His Excellency the British Ambassador at Constantinople (Angora) and ask him to kindly obtain a copy of the abovementioned Power of Attorney for me.

In our tele'gram 'o.32 of March 24th we informed you of the Secretary of State’s approval of the procedure you recommended by which the Shaikh of Kuwait should be advised to refuse service of the judicial documents relating to his Bashiyah and Faddaghiyah date gardens. 2. I should perhaps explain, however, that in the case of the Faddaghiyah gardens we do not think that the Shaikh, in claiming immunity from process in the Iraqi courts, should go so far as to refuse to defend the suit when it eventually comes before the Court. For he would then inevitably lose his case, and we do not wish him to do so unnecessarily. Indeed, even if the case does go against him, it may be important, for the purpose of determining the liability of His Majesty’s Government under the guarantee given to him, that the ground on which the case is decided against him should be clear. It may for instance make a difference whether he loses the case merely because of non-registration or because the vendors never were in a position to confer on him a valid title. 3* We suggest, therefore, that when the case comes on, he should enter a defence under protest; and that every effort should be made to ensure that the Court is favourably constituted, and that the Shaikh has the best possible legal advice.

The power of attorney was issued by the then Q,adhi of the Court of Galata, Constantinople, Mustafa Kadhim Effendi on the 15th Ramadhan 1326. 3. It is important that His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad should be able to produce a copy of ’Aishah’s power of attorney to her husband, but it has not been possible up to the present to find either the power of attorney or a copy of it, although mention is made of the date of the power of attorney in another document.

My dear Dickson, The information contained in your confidential letter No. 156 of September 10th, 1932, has proved to he so valuable that I trust you will forgive me applying to you for a few further particulars on the same subject. You show that A1 Faddaghiyah is a garden of approximately 420 jaribs, excluding the waqf and Bashiyah portions. The information which we have obtained from the * Iraqi Government, however, shows that, according to their records, the Shaikh 1 s Faddaghiyah property is of an area of 946 jaribs. A possible solution of the discrepancy is that, in addition to the u Awasha” portion of the Faddaghiyah estate now under dispute of approximately 420 jaribs, the Shaikh may have another property in the Faddaghiyah which is not concerned in the dispute. This theory derives some colour from the remark contained in paragraph 8 of your despatch No. 101 of June 29th, 1932, to the Resident, in which you refer t6 the suit in respect of the Faddaghiyah affecting one-third of the estate proper. 1° L/ ‘ A ,t.-Colonel H.R.P.

The information contained in your ccaafidential letter No.156 of September 10th, 1932, has proved to be so valuable that I trust you will forgive me applying to you for a few further particulars on the same subject. You show that Al Faddaghiyeh is a garden of approximately 420 Jaribs, excluding the waqf and Bashlyah portions. The infor nation, which we have obtained from the Iraqi Government, however shows that, according to their records the Shaikh’s Faddaghiyeh property is of an area of 946 Jaribs. A possible solution of the discrepancy is that, in addition to the 'Awaetoa' portion of the Faddaghiyeh estate now under dispute of approximately 420 Jaribs, the Shaikh may have another property in the Faddaghiyeh which is not concerned in the dispute.

POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. No.114. Dated the 31st May 1933. From Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., Polltical Agent, Kuwait; To 'The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSH I R E . Faddagihiyeh Case. Sir, I have the honour to report a rather interesting developiaent in the matter of the above, disputed property, which I think both you and His Majesty’s Government should know about. 2. As you are aware, of the whole property known as the Faddaghiyeh Estate, the Bashiyeh strip is under dispute, as is also 'that portion of the Faddaghiyeh, which was bought by Shaikh Mubarak from the Lady 'Awasha” through her husband . Jhmad Pasha al Zuhair, for £T.44,217. 3* Full details as to the position, history, etc. of the disputed properties were recently sent to Mr. Stafford of the British &lt;lmbassy, Baghdad by me, in this Office Confidential D.O.No.107, dated the 24th May 1933, a copy of which was also sent to you. 4. You have already appreciated no doubt, that there are six young ladies claiming the third and largest portion ox the Bashiyeh”, one of whom, Rafiyah, has already got a judgement in her favour.5# You have also doubtless gathe 2 *ed that the claim- ) daughters of Aw&amp;sha ; (c) Alda ) who each claim 1/3 of the disputed area. 6 . Hitherto/ we have heard a lot about the activities of (a) Abdulla al Zuhair, but little mention has been made of the ladies (b) Hajeeba and (c) Aida, her sister. 7. (a)Abdulla al Zuhair, who lives in Basrah, so far has been the only of the three who has filed a suit. His A cousins (b) Najeeba and (c) Aida have been content to re main in Constantinople and watch events, Icnowing full well that if Abdulla won his case they would easily get judge ments in their favour also, as the claims of each are identi cal. 8 . Recently (b), the Lady lajeeba, arrived in Basrah f impatient at the slow progress that (a) Abdulla as Zuhair was making in the matter. 9. The lawyer employed by (a) Abdulla al Zuhair is one Mr.Sulaiman al Shawaf, son, I believe, of the President of the Shpi^reh Court in Baghdad; while K.B.Mirza Lohamed, C.I.Z., has been engaged on behalf of (b) Najeeba and (o) Aida. Lawyer, of the firm of Yacub and Arteen, who, with Mirza Mohamed Khan may be considered the two best lawyers that Basra can produce, is watching the case on behalf of His Excellency the bha.ikh of Kuwait. persons: ants to the disputed 'Faddaghiyeh' Estate consist of 3 (a) Abdulla al Zuhair, nephew of Awasha ; (b) Najeeba ) On the other side of the picture, an Armenian Note. The position of these lawyers and the^a? clients they respectively represent, is, I think, important. 10. Last week (28.5*33.) both Mr.Gabriel and i.-irza iiohameflMirza Mohamed visited Kuwait, and called independently on the Shaikh and myself. 11. The gist of their separate conversations with me may be summed up as follows:- ( a ) Mirza liohamed , assured me, had only come to collect certain debts, due from Kuwaitis to his client, the late Shaikh of Moharamerah, but gradual - i ' eo,une “ ,o a ‘* he gave it as his opinion that the Shaikh had no chance, whatsoever, of winning, should the case come into Court, as it was bound to do eventually, however much the Shaikh tried to wriggle out of it, by refusing to accept sum mons etc. etc. Mirza Iiohamed added that quite the best thing he (the Shaikh) could do, in his opinion, was to try and compound the case. He thought he could persuade (b)Najeeba and (c) Aida to accept £3000/- each, although they would certainly ask £5000 and Mr.Gabriel would suggest this sum to the Shaikh. He could not, however, say anything about (a) Abdulla al Zuhair. He mentioned, however, that the youngman owed Najeebi Rs.20,000/-, for vfliich an I.O.U. had passed hands (date expired) and that he (Mirza Mohamed) believed he could bring pressure to bear on him by threatening to put him in Court for failure to pay this debt if he would not ’toe the line’. (b) Mr.Gabriel . in his interview, was equally emphatic about the Shaikhs case being a hopeless ly baa one in Law, and that his one and only hope lay in our being able to get from Istamboul, a copy of the original Fewer of Attorney, granted ky ' Awasha ' to her husband, authorizing the sale- 4 - V of her property• (This has already been asked for) Mr ♦Gabriel then said that the Shaikhs best course, if we failed to get the above document, was to pay £T.5000/- to each of the three parties in the case, and so settle the matter for good and all, otherwise he saw every chance of the Shaikh losing the whole of that portion of the Ifa&amp;daghiyeh property which was in dispute and with it the £T*44,317/-, originally given for it. Lastly Mr.Gabriel said that he had hinted this form of settlement to the Shaikh, but the latter had not appeared enthusiastic, and had said something about consulting the Political Agent• Note. Up to the time of writing the Shaikh has not mentioned the matter to the writer. IS* It is interesting to note that Mirza Mohamed and Mr.Gabriel are great personal friends, and on this occasion travelled to and fran Kuwait in the same car. They also lived together whilst in Kuwait. 13. It is also interesting to recollect that Mr. Gabriel was the lawyer working for the other side in the 'Bashiyeh* case when the Basra Courts gave a decree in favour of Rafiy&amp;h, daughter of Shafiqa, On that occasion Mirza Mohamed, who represented Rafiyah and another sister, appointed Mr.Gabriel to take charge of the case as he being a Persian could not take part in the Courts proceedings M* Incidentally, when discussing with Mr.Gabriel the old Bashiyeh suit, the writer got the interesting ad mission out of him that had the Shaikh been properly de fended, he would never have lost that property; as, if a certain point of Ottoman Land Law had been raised by the defence, the whole prosecutions case would have fallen toto the ground. The Shaikhs Agent in Basrah had employed, he said, a 3rd rate man called Mr.Mansur, who, through sheer ignorance of the law, threw the case away. (The above was mentioned in strict confidence, of course). 15. Both Mirza liohamed and Mr.Gabriel mentioned that Abdulla al Zuhair, had promised his own lawyer, Mr.SulAiman Shawaf £2,500/- if the latter won the Fad- daghiyeh case for him, and nothing if he did not - an illuminating example of the methods of the Basrah Bar. 16. I have thought it my duty to report the above facts in detail, as I do not particularly trust any law yer in Basrah and have more than a suspicion that both the Bashiyeh and Faddaghiyeh suits, were originally worked up by an interested gang of advocates, who, no doubt, hoped and do still hope to bleed both the Shaikh and their own clients thoroughly, before finishing with them. 17. I am still unable to decide in my own mind why the suggestions that the Shaikh should compoT&amp;nd the case, has, at this eleventh hour,been brought forward by the Shaikhs lawyer as well as by the lawyer of one of the plaintiffs in the suit. Possibly Mr.Gabriel and Mirza Mohamed, who are a little too intimate, for my liking, have got wind of seme thing from Baghdad, which makes them apprehensive as to the eventual outcome of the case. They certainly know that His Majesty’s Government is deeply in terested, and might even send out their own counsel to watch proceedings if the case went to Court.

In his words:' had ’IRAQ, been on friendly terms with Kuwait then there would have been no danger at all M , but as an ’Iraqi he had to admit that the contrary was the case, and it was clear that the ’Iraq Government was acting and might continue to act in a distinctly unfriendly manner towards Kuwait - hence there was danger. 6 * ^hen I asked Mr. Gabriel what was the form such danger might take, he replied as follows. 'There would be no attack, on the line that the Shaikhs of Kuwait had no Tapu deeds, that line of procedure need not be feared in Law, but what was to prevent the Mudir of Rao, acting on secret orders from l^aghdad (through the Mutasarrif, BasrahJ and stirring up the fellaheen tenants to commit acts of 'sabotagesuch to pay rents to their landlord, and lodging a complaint to Government that they, the fellaheen, were the original owners of the soil, and that their lands had wrongfully been given over to the Shaikhs of Kuwait, and claiming that such unfriendly Iraq could easily make it convenient to encourage such complaints, and even assist the fellaheen to bring their case to the Courts and supply them with expert legal advice'. as cutting down palm trees and selling them same), refusing lands be restored to them again, (Irish fashion). An 7. If such were to happen said Mr.Gabriel, there is no/no knowing what might be the eventual result of such proceedings, but he opined that it was quite on the cards that the Shaikh of Kuwait would find himself eventually- deprived of all his ^ao properties, in the same way that many Saadun owners of vast estates on the ISuphrates, had in recent years found themselves deprived of half and even more of thfcir lands which had reverted to the tribes (fellaheen) who Originally cultivated the lands, and had for centuries been looked upon as *sarakeel*,i«e. tenants o« the land, 8 » To counteract such a possible move on the I'RAQ, Government’s part Mr, Gabriel said it was imperative for the present Shaikh to take out Tapu papers. The great difficulty in doing this said Mr, Gabriel, was that the heirs to-day numbered two or three hundred souls, including a host of women, and that the Shaikh would find it most ^ difficult to get hold of all their names, and have them v included in any Tapu deeds taken out. He had nevertheless advised the Shaikh to authorise him to take action on the above lines but for the present the Shaikh, apart from pointing out the almost insurmountable difficulties of such procedure, had done nothing, 9, After Mr, Gabriel’s departure the Shaikh dis cussed the matter with me, and said he quite saw the wisdom of Mr, Gabriel’s advice but felt the difficulties were too great, and action on his part would be interpreted by the many members of his family to an attempt to rob them of their rights. He was therefore reall- afraid to act, and must be given time to think, 10, A curious thing recently happened in connection with these Kao Estates, Barly in Ha r 1933, the Mutasartff, Basrah, sent a committee down to ^ao to examine and value the Shaikh’s Kao property, I cannot see what right he had-4- tn do thin, ^but he did nevertheles s. The property consists of over 6,000 H jaribs*. A year or two ago a ’jariV was worth easily Rs.1000/-. This would have made the Tao properties worth Re.60,00,000 or approximately £ 400,000/-. Assuming that the value of land has fallen 'by half, which I do not think is the case, then the value of the property would to-day he approximately £ 200 , 000 /-. The Mutasarrif’s committee after making their secret investigation valued the Instates at I. 54 f 000/-» or £ 54,000/-, an obviously ridiculous figure. This is an open secret in Basrah to-day. The question is what is behind the move. Both Mr. Gabriel and the Shaikh reported the incident to me and are anxious. 11 , The above is reported for what it is worth, but from the anxiety in Mr. Gabriel's voice, when he discussed t^e business, I am inclined to think there is -1 danger* ahead. T?or the moment things may take their course, but I think a reference to the Embassy, Baghdad, might not be amiss. The trouble is that enquiry from the J%ibassy might set up an undesirable trend of thought among Iraqi officials - as such matters cannot 1 e kept secret long in aghdad* Lieut.-Colonel -Political Agent , Kuwait BTTSHIRIS, Bated the 8 th June 1933.s , ^ CONFIDENTIAL.

My dear Hall, 'Vill you please refer to your letter (Ho.K 1735/308/93) of April 13th asking for further information regard ing the date gardens of the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait in ’Iraq, ''h'e following are the particulars you require:- (a) The Shaikh of Moharnmerah has m apu titles to all his property in ’Iraq and no dispute seems likely to arise in respect of his ownership of then. by Hickson, which gives information regarding the Shaikh of Kuwait’s title to his estates in ’Iraq, which are covered bv the 1914 undertaking. Kou will see fron this that, with the exception of the 'Sashiyah and the ^addaghiyah gardens, his title is regarded as incontestable. Tour enquiry narrows i + self down to the approximate capital value of these two estates. n *he Administrative Inspector, Basrah, estimates the present capital value of the ^addaghiyah estate as between £ 40 and £ 75 a t 1arib 0 ''’here are 420 jaribs in dispute, and at the mean average price of K 57 a jarib, the estate nay be said to be worth £ 24,000 without revenue exemption, and &lt;226,400 v/ith exemption. As regards the Bashiyah, the estimated value of the estate at this rate would be &lt;21,767 without exemption, and £1,943 with exemption, f/hen assessing the maximum capital liability which would fall on His Majestj’-’s Government, if the account must be taken of the amounts originally paid by his 0 &gt;) 1 enclose a copy of a no+e supplied at our request Shaikh is dispossessed finally from both these properties, ancestor/ancestor as the purchase price of the properties in 1908. In the case of the ^addaRhiyah estate the purchase price v/as ^,60,000. In the case of the ^ashiyah estate the purchase price was ^,4,489. It is from tM s ^hat a curious point emerges. I find from the Report on the ^rade of Basrah for the year 1908, compiled by Hr. Consul Crowe and published in the diplomatic and Consular deports H 0 b 4869, Annual Series, that the -fh was worth 18/Sd. during 1908. 'Haling the f r '\ as 18 shillings, +he purchase price for the tv/o estates was /'58 &gt; 040 as compared with an approximate present- day valuation of £28,343. If the Shaikh is dispossessed from his estates, he would presumably have the right to recover the purchase money, and, if the above figures are correct, he would be entitled to recover more than the properties are no?/ worth. I am asking some further enquiries but the figures of present-day valuation, are not likely to be disturbed on account of them. I have just seen Bowie and have passed on this informatio to him - T fear that no further progress is likely to be made in tills case for some months. Yours ever, (Sign#d) n B.H.Humphrys•2942/33 . INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON , S.W.l. 7th June 1933. Sir, In reply to your letter of 20th May, No.E.2527/ 308/93, on the subject of the date gardens of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he concurs in the proposal in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Office letter under reply. As regards the question of incidence, Sir Samuel Hoare has already made it clear that he cannot accept any liability on behalf of Indian revenues in respect of any ccmpensation which may be paid either to the Sheikh of Koweit or to the Sheikh of Mohammerah in composition for the assurances given to those rulers on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in 1914. 2.

(a) The whole t9hddaghiyah estate, including the Bashiyah portion, belonging to the Shaikh of Kuwait has an area of approximately 946 jaribs (a jarib being 4,744 v square yards, or slightly less than an acre). (b) Of this area, properties of approximately 516 jaribs in area are properly registered in the Tapu Department r, apu Sanads are held for them and there is no dispute affecting the Shaikh^ title. (c) Of the balance of 430 jaribs. the Bashiyah estate occupies 43 jaribs, of which 33 jaribs arejn dispute. (d) The purchase price of the disputed portion, calculated from the price paid for the whole B af ,hiyah estate in 1908, was £T.3,445. (e) The portion of the ^addaghi^ah estate proper which is under dispute has an area of 387 jaribs, for which a sum of £^.44,487 wan paid in 1908. S. Taking the £T as having been worth 18 shillings in 1908/ ’he Bight Honourable Sir John Siiaon, O.C.8.I., K.C.^.O.,etc.,etc.,etc.- 2 - 1908 for the reason given in Sir Lancia Huwphrys , letter, the anounts in sterling mid for those properties #iich form the subject of litigation, and of which the Shaildi of Kuwait may be deprived, are: ■%ddaghiyah estate .. £39,795 (£ 102.8 per jarib). Sashiyah estate .. £ 3,100 (£ 93.9 per jarib). 3. The approximate present day value of these properties at the average figure of £ 57 per jarib is: Ifoddaghiyah estate ... £22,059. Baohiyah estate ... £ 1,881. ISven if an additional 50^ is allowed on these figures the present clay value is well below the original purchase price. rrt he Administrative Inspector at Basrah has recorded his opinion that the estates could not be sold today for as large a sum as was paid for them in 1908, This supports the opinion erpressed in Tir “^ranois Humphrys* letter under reference to the effect that, if the Shaikh is dispossessed fbrom these properties and is able to recover the amount originally paid for them by his ancestor, he would obtain more than the properties are worth in the market today. 4. In this connection I would mention that the Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, in the course of a discussion, expressed the opinion that a claim against the Shaikh for damages for loss of mesne profits on account of wrongful possession would fail because the claimants have taken no action to recover their property during the twenty-five ^ears throughout which the Hheikh has been in occupation, ^he Legal Secretary concurs in this opinion. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Honourable the/CONffID ^ITIAL. POLITICAL AGMCY, 1 OT/AIT • O.O.NO,145. Dated the 6 th July 1955. My dear Fowle, I am writing this by D.O. as I can get it done quicker this way, and as it is mail day I want to get the contents off to you without delay. 2. The Shaikh as you know returned from Bahrain yesterday afternoon after a most stormy journey of 4 days. I met Mil on the jetty (Arab fashion) and called formally on him this morning# 5. I was able to discuss your Confidential No. 715-3 of 23rd June, but not your No#547-S of 25th May - the latter question the Shaikh promised to talk over on Saturday next ( 8 th July). 4 . I come now to the point of this letter. Do you remember the note which I gave you at Bushlre (dated 8 th June) on the Shaikh of Kuwaits ; '&amp;o Estates. You sent a copy to &gt; aghdad under your Confidential Ko.640-3, dated the 10th June. 6 . I would ask you in particular to refer to paras 5 to 11 of my note# 6 . The Shaikh it seems on his return from Bahrain was presented with a bunch of letters from his FAO Agent the gist of which was that the fellaheen of his FAG estates, had started giving serious trouble, and were in fact behaving in exactly the way that I foreshadowed might/ The Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C#W.Fowle, C.3#S#, Political Besident in the Persian Gulf,2 - might happen in para 6 of my n Note on the Fao Estates'. reports the trouble began first in the northern half of the Fao property then rapidly spread to the southern half and that at the time of writing the 'bad hats' were rapidly gaining over the faithful few, and persuading them to join in. Many acts of'sabotage' have taken place, such as cutting down trees, etc., and about two thirds of the fellaheen had refused point blank to give the Shaikhs Agent, firewood, palm fronds (scxaf)* fruit, fodder, etc. etc., which is normally sent to Kuwait at this time of the year, for the use of the Shaikhs household, and which is the Shaikhs absolute right to collect. 8 . The fellaheen in other words, had started an intensive 'non-cooperation' campaign, and in reply to the Agents protests appear to have everywhere given the same reply, namely, 'The Iraq Government is our Government, and not the Shaikh of Kuwait, we are the owners of the soil, and have been born and bred on it. ^ur government (IRAQ) is going to help us, and will make us the ' Mallaks ' or propriotors instead of the shaikh of ^.uwait. 9 # According to the Shaikh, the Agent further made report that he had gone to the Mudir of Fao and com plained officially against the fellaheen and their behaviou That the Mudir had sent for the 'Mukhtars' (headmen) and told them they must behave themselves, and pay the Shaikhs share quietly and in orderly manner; but that so far nothing had happened. 10. The Shaikh, who, I could see, was greatly wor ried and excited about the matter, added that he had just received a telegram from his Agent to the effect that there were signs that the trouble was spreading to 7. According to the shaikh, his Agent h^ Agents his/3 his fadd&amp;ghiyeh fellaheen, and asked for orders. 11. The Shaikh gave it as his positive opinion that the udir cf i ? ao himself was at the lottom of the trouble, and that he was acting under the secret and ex press orders of the Mutasarrif, Basrah. In other words just the prophesy, which Ur.Gabriel mace to me,/before I came over to Bushire, appears now to be coming true inevery detail. 12* The Shaikh urged me to report the matter to you without delay, remarking, n T'his is what I get for being the friend of you * haglish ,,t . 13. The I-Iudir was of course (Turkish fashion) out wardly pretending to help his agent, said the Shaikh, but in reality was himself stirring up his tenants to act as they were doing. 14. Personally in view of what ,r.Gabriel told me at the end of lay, and knowing the pleasant methods of the modem Iraqi Officials, I am myself convinced that what the Shaikh has told me is the correct interpretation of the business. It is merely a new form of attack on the part of the IRAQ, Government on the Shaikh of Kuwait. The danger of course lies in its underhandedness. They will, of course, indignantly deny all responsibility and will call for a report. This will, no doubt, show con clusively that the Shaikh of Kuwait has been oppressing his fellaheen for years, and that the poor devils have been driven to 'to kick' at last, (the common method adopted in the case of the 'A1 Saadun'). Government will then deem it right to interfere out of an honest and disinterest ed desire to see justice done to their Iraqi subjects etc etc. and no one can say how the matter will end.CQNlfl DI^TIAL POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT• No.155.

Abdullah Beg al Faleh Pasha al Sa’adun (recently released from prison) to myself. 2. Letter ’’A* is merely sent you for information. I do not think there is any need for you to take any action, seeing that Messrs: Gabriel &amp; Co., the Shaikh’s lawyers can be trusted to watch matters and give any advice that may be necessary. 5. Letter 'B' is interesting. The Shaikh tells me that he received a very similar letter to mine from Abdul Aziz Beg al Faleh Pasha (brother) but that he is i a letter, dated the 21st June 1955 'B' is a letter dated 25th June 1953 from entirely/• 2 •• entirely unaware of any claim liaving ever existed or having ever been put forward before to any portion of his property by any member of the A1 Sa’adun. 4. The shaikh further tells me that Abdul Aziz Beg al Sa’adun owns the gardens next door to his Fao Estates (immediately on the north side) and he is almost certain that in the same way as his fellaheen on the Fao Estates have been stirred up by some one recently to refuse to pay their rightful dues, (for the first time in their lives) , so some one has been arranging for Abdul Aziz Beg to lay a ficticious claim to a portion of his (che Shaikh’s) Eao Estates, and that the above letters to me and to him (the Shaikh) are the first move in a new game# 5. Both the Shaikh and I have written friendly replies pointing out that no member of the Al Sa’adun has ever laid claim to any of the Al Subah property be fore, and that if there are any documents, supporting such claims, they should b© sent to Kuwait for examination# 6 . The Shaikh of course, suspects that the present Mut&amp;sarrif of Basrah is behind things and it will be in teresting to see developments.'8” Translation of a Isttsr dated the 25th ..une 1935, from Abdulla al Faleh as-aa'adun, to Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Diokson, O.I.E., H.B.M's Political Agent, Kuwait ooo After Compliments* I bag to bring to Your excellency's attention that w brother Abdul Aziz Beg al Faleh says that he is claiming a piece of garden in the «MA«iOffR» from our brothers Al-3ubah. Since the Cuhah’s family end ours are the seme family, and from old have had friendly relations, and since you are a frined of both, X deemed it better to refer their case to their elder brother (you). I am sure that both of them will accept your judgement. I hope that the inheritance, which has been left or,,* erthers is confirmed for us, that by our grandfathers and fethers, is we may leave it as an inheritance to our sons.

In short the British Embassy in Iraq has informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had made excuse that he could not serve the documents on the luler of uuwait. For this reason the papers have returned to the Basrah Courts, and the latter have in consequence postponed proceeding in the case, on the grounds that Your Excellency is in Bahrain. I trust that you will thank the oiltical Resident for this state of affairs. Apert from the above, I beg to tell you something else. Your adversary’s agent recently took the following action:- Ile approached .skander Mansoor (Your Excellency’s recently empoyed lawyer), and suggested that he (the lawyer) become a partner in the case. When your adversary’s agent learned that a diffi culty had arisen about serving the documents (on you, the Shaikh), he decided as a precaution to attach the produce of the 'Faddaghiyeh'. His idea being that by making such attachment, Your Excellency would lodge a complaint, and would/would then give a general power of attorney to your present lawyer. Please pass this Inforaation on to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that he may take steps to counter this plan before it comes off. Your wishes, however, are the best.

INDIA OFFICE, P* 2* 5380/33. Confidential. WHITEHALL, 3.W. I* lath Jims 1933. Dear sir Percy, You will remember that there has been a great aeal of discussion about the assurances in respect of their date gardens in Iraq which were given to the Sheikhs of Koweit and ho hammer ah, in return for their assistance at the beginning of the War, in 1914. There has recently been an effort to challenge the title of the Sheikh of Koweit to certain of-the date gardens possession of which was guaranteed to him in 1914, on the ground that his title was never properly registered. As you will remember, the title was not registered before the War because the Turkish Government would agree to registration only on condition that the Sheikh declared himself a Turkish subject, which, on our advice and at our request, he was unwilling to do. 2. In 1915, Sir Henry Dobbs, as Revenue Commissioner granted the Sheikh of Koweit a taou deed of registration in respect of the property now in dispute. The grant was admittedly not in accordance with the Ottoman law, and for this and various other technical reasons it has been argued that the deed of registration was void ah initio . We are inclined to think, however, that if, as we presume was the case, the Revenue Commissioner was authorised to register property in tarn by virtue of one of the proclamations, articles or laws referred to in Part VIII of the Iraq Constitution, of which I enclose a copy, and if in registering the Sheikh's estate he did not act in contravention of or exceed the authority conferred unon him, sneral Sir Percy Cox, G-.C.M.G. CT.G.I.ii.,K.C.S.I. I 25, Kensington Palace Mansions, De Verb Gardens,!.8. it/it should be possible to defend the legality of the registration. -t seems to us possible that in carrying out the registration of this property and others, Sir H. Dobbs was acting under the general authority of some irmy- proclamation or order which authorised him, in his capacity of hevenue uommissioner, to carry out transactions of this character. We have succeeded in tracing a reference in Army Orders to his appointment (on 26th January lvl5) as Revenue Commissioner, but we have been unable (the papers are very confused and there are many gaps in them) to find any corresponding order indicating the nature 01 the duties which he was to perform in that capacity. I wonder if, by any chance, you remember after this long interval whether there was in fact any formal proclamation or order by the Army Commander specifying the Revenue Commissioner’s duties? If your recollection is that there was we will search amain, since if the duties defined included property registration without stipulating that registration must be in accordance with the old Ottoman Law, then it might greatly strengthen our hands in contending that Part VIII of the Iraq Constitution could be consicered as validating his registration of the Sheikh’s pro perty. 3* I must apologise for bothering you with a point such as this, I need not say how grateful we shall be for any assistance you may be able to give us. tour's smcapely, &amp; G.

(b) In any case in which judgment is given against him, would Sneikh of Kov/eit be able to establish case for stay of execution until claim for refund of original purchase money had oeen heard, aid, in the event of such claim being allowed until it had been ascertained that plaintiff was in a position to make necessary refund? This demand could presumably only be made if heirs of vendor, from whom refund would be claimed, were identical with plaintiffs in the case, or were predecessors in title of the latter, and I shall be glad of information cm this point.

Annual payments would he easier to relate to the Sheikh*s losses and they would have the additional advantage that the The Ik ha would not bo able to spend the money all at ones and In eonsequenoe revert to their present state of dissatisfaction* Fortunately it now appeared that the amount involved was* at any rats in present eimmstancoa much smaller than had at one time been thought probable, and that m annual mm of about B2 f 00Q at the outside would probably cover the case of both Sheikhs* Sir Francis Humphry© eugviestsd two possible courses (a) to pay the sheikhs an annual sum representing their annual losses under the tax each year* or (to to pay them each year © fijted sum to be agreed upon now, which would he somewhat- in excess of their losses during the first year* nr Francis Humphry® was then obliged to leave the meeting owing to an important engagement elsewhere* oq Mr* Woods said that the Trescury took the view that the- X f aw Officers ? Opinion to the effect that His Fsiesty’s 0 ovorrimemt were under a legal obligation to compensate the Sheikhs, should not be regarded as having any binding effect upon Hi® Majesty’s government* It was not a judgment given in a court of law* fhe treasury ©till conoidered that it waa open to His Majesty’s Government to bargain with the dneikhst0 *** * I'W sun In compensetlont which should be the lowest amount which would be acceptable to them. Moreover, compensation of this kind was normally paid in the foj*m of one lump sum, and continued annual payments might well be a source of embarrassment in Parliament. Xn any case difficulties would arise aa to the period of time for which annual payments were to be made. Sir Francis Humphrys had suggested In one of his telegrams that annual payment a should be made only for the lifetime of the present Sheikhs. But would it be possible to bind the Sheikhs and their heirs end successors finally to any such arrangenent? A perpetual annuity voted annually by Parliament seemed to be out of the question. Mr. Mendel suggested that an attempt should be made to reach an agreement with the Sheikhs as to an annual amount, and that that annual amount should than he capitalised (either on a basis of a perpetual annuity or of so many years purchase) and Parliamentary sanction obtained for the capital sum required. This would mean that Parliamentary sanction would be required for one payment only. The capital sum could, if necessary, then be put under the control of trustees, the resultant income only being payable to the sheikhs annually on certain conditions# Mr* thought that this was a possible course, but that there would still remain a question ee to the basis upon which the annual payment should be capitalised. 25. H r. Loithwal to said that, while the indie nf ioe were not financially interested, he was inclined to think that prims Xs&amp;iJi27* / fgoie the 8 ugga©tirm that compensation paid to the .heikhe should take the Torta of nnnual p&amp;^iienta wes en sttreotiv© one® It would give us an additional hold over the Sheikh of Koweit« Moreover, if on the death of the Sheikh of Vo ham^errdn It was felt that the ret'iione of His l^ajest^s Government with his successor were such that the discontinuance of ta£ ©siempticm could he justified in his case. It ^Ighi wel .1 he that adoption of this method of compensation would substantially reduce the financial burden involved In compensation. On the question of the period of exemption on which compensation should be based, he drew attention to the categorical wording of the, pledgee of 1914, in which no term was set t' the period of the exemption. Whatever the circumstances In the case of ?*ohanmerah, ^ It w' ulu be extremely difficult in the case of Koweit, without serious lose of prestige, now to define cur liability as ceasing with the death of tie present Sheikh. ffl*« Rcndel considered that it would be equally difficult to agree on the precise amount of the compensation to be paid to the Sheikhs, whether it should take the form, of &amp; perpetual or a temporary annuity or of a capital lump payment. That difficulty would exist in any case, but the ratio between trie annuity and the capital required to provide it would be merely a question of mathematical calculation. He did not think that the main issue of principle was really af'ccted by this point, snl in eny case he was of the opinion that it would be impracticable to decide either the amount £f the method of compensation until it was known whether the possession point bad been satisfactorily » settledrecalled that at the interdepartmental meeting oi* 1 st* it had been decided %o prepare a caae Tor the ^atf t-frieera with a view to obtaining their opinion on the chances of success, if His Majesty 1 a aovemment took the Ira&lt;it Government to arhitx’atlon on the whole question* It had so far h@@n impossible to find Uts© to prepare this case, and indeed ths 1 lkel inood of His Majesty’s Government deciding to go to arbivra^ion was extremely small* He thought, however, that when the question came to he considered by the Cabinet, It would be necessary to be able to furnish them with a definite estimate of toe chances of success if the question w?ere referred to arbitration, as otherwise they would be unable to decide whether any settlement proposed was a satisfactory one* Mr* Beckett agreed* He also pointed out that# supposing King Feisal falie to implement his promise to Sir Francis Humphrya, and supposing i** was when x ound impossible to porous tie the Iraqi Government to pass legislation validating the Sheikh of Koweit’s title, it would be essential that we should know th© ehanoes of success if the matter were referred to arbitration. C 8 * The following were the conclusions of the meetings« (i) That King FeloaX should be given until September or October to Implement his promise to Sir Francis Humphry©, and that.

Gabriel. I P. With regard to the loss of estates by the Ba’duns in the Kuntafiq, X am advised that the circufnstances obtaining in those cases differed widely from anything that has occurred during the Bhalkh of Kuwait’s occupancy of his w a0 Estate. '•’he Sa'duns were generally absentee landlords of the worst description and seldom had more than a nominal overlord ship of the lands in question. Hiey had for years been unable to collect their share of the revenue from the lands, and their titles werein many cases faulty. 'liey appealed to Government for assistance in obtaining some revenue from the tribesmen in occupation of the lands, and it was necessary to have recourse to a Government Commission to consider the whole problem of their rights in the land. As far as X am aware, they were not deprived of anything to which they had an effective title. 3 , It would seem, therefore, though one would naturally hesitate to advise the Shaikh to disrepard the advice of his lawyer,/ The Honotirable nie Political Resident in the ^ersian Gulf, Bu shire.\VX la^er, that the Shaikh wi*?ht he told that the position does not on the face of It seew to he quite so precarious as Mr, Gabriel apnears to imagine, and that, bv waiting for the Land Settlement, which is in progress in parts of ’Iraq and will eventually extend throughout the country, to reach ^ao, he would thereby at any rate save himself a great deal of trouble and expense. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant.y% fr\ ^ T) Note “by Legal Secretary on Liententant-Colonel r:, • C, “^wle’s confidential deepatch ^o.640-fJ of 10th June 1933, ^he danger© envisaged by Mr. Oabriel are of so hypothetical a nature that it is not easy to advise. Certainly a T apu title would be a better one than reliance upon an Ottoman firman. However, the 'halkh and his denendents have been in quiet and uncom + ested possession of the ^ao estates for so long that 1 cannot see from what quarter a claimant can arise with proof of better title than the Shaikh possesses. Mr. Gabriel himself appears to consider the position safe enough in law, ^Shat he apparently fears is a rising of the fellaheen, attively encouraged and supported by the ’Iraqi Govern ment. ''his would be an extra-legal movement, and, if it occurred. His Majesty’s Government would presumably have something to say on the matter. Owing to the system of inheritance operating under Mahoroedan law, the preparation of r, apu deeds for this large estate would be a matter of great difficulty. It would result in profit, no doubt, to Mr. Gabriel, but the Ghaikh is wise, I think, to hesitate before embarking on it. I think he would be better advised to wait until the comureheneive land settlement, which is now being carried out throughout ’Iraq, reaches ^ao, when, after a careful survey of the land has been made, he should have no difficulty in obtaining complete title deeds from the Bet tlement Commis sion.

PoliticalTranslation of letter No.R/3/1085 dated 1 st Babi Than! 1352 (24th July 1933) from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed Al-Jabir As-Subah, K* G* I.E., c.S.I*, Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kussrait. With reference to the conversation which I had with Your Excellency yesterday regarding the 'Hallaheen' of our date gardens in Fao, and the dis turbances which they are creating. I have to inform Your Excellency that every year, at this season, the palm fronds are cut from the trees and when this takes place we normally send special boats from Kuwait to bring our share of the palm fronds, for our own house-hold use, through our local representative. This is done under the control and check of Fao Customs Department as Your Excellency is aware from the lists, which you annually receive from the Director of Fao Customs. This year according to our usual custom we sent our boats for the above purpose, and our 'Fallaheen' actually began to cut the palm fronds according to usual custom but certain 'Fall&amp;heen' who in the past have given us a certain amount of trouble started spreading false and malicious stories by means of which they were able to induce the loyal 'Fallaheen' to refuse to deliver to us our share of the palm fronds. We, although w© knew about the doings of these evil persons, and their apparent determination to create disturbances, decided to move slowly and patiently in the matter. We therefore instructed our Fao Representative to take up a reasonable attitude and attempt to placate the n Fellaheen” in case they should have any serious grievances.-( 2 )- The ring leaders were able, however, to counter his efforts by spreading reports that the autho rities (in Basra) were behind them and would help them. He, our representative, was obliged therefore to write a letter to us which you will find herewith in original. We, for our part, in spite of the written report of our representative to the effect that the '’Fallaheen were still refusing to deliver our share of the palm fronds, for a while decided to postpone direct action in the matter. But when w© saw that our tenants persisted in their determination to create trouble and refuse to pay us our dues we instructed our Basra lawyer to put the case officially before the authorities for their consideration and action. He the lawyer duly informed the Mudir of Siba (Fao) who sent for our Fao Agent and asked him for a full report on the case, and especially what had been the customary procedure in the past. Our representative appears to have explained everything to him fully, and the Mudir thereupon wrote to the f, Mukhtar’ f (head man) of Fao ordering him to instruct the ? Failaheen n to deliver over to us our usual share, to look ms3tX after the gardens in their charge properly, to prevent water from flooding the palm areas (by keeping the protective dykes in order), and to drive away all straying or unknown animals. The 'Mukhtar* informed them accordingly, but we regret to say that not] ing at all has resulted from these instructions. Subsequently the Assistant to the Police Commandant of Basra Aiwa visited the Fao Administrative Headquarters, and sent for all our 'Fallaheen', and asked them to reply to certain questions which he put to them. The latter were divided into two partys, the{5)«» the first party replied horn atly end gRT© the true ^ ? history of everything that pertained to our property hut the second party, oSnaiating of the ring leaders and disturbers of the pas**, did not give hi® any clear out or satisfactory reply* At one time they said that they were the real owners of the land, and at another that they had a right to take for their mm use three quarters of the total produce, and again that they lastly that never gave more than one quarter to the landlord, and / the palm fronds were theirs to dispose of and not the landlord* s* After thie enquiry the 1 ollce Officer returned to Basra, but hi© investigation© have had no result except that some of the loyal * Fall* been* 1 have now delivered a aroll portion of the palm fronds* We heard that on the ahth Pafei Awal X35S, the Hu dir of Slfea himself a^in visited Government Headquarters at Fao, and made further enquiries into the matter, returning the earns day* -e have now been informed that as a result of this visit the 'GuMiter'' of Pao sent for all our r ’FftUM&amp;e*n” and forbade them to out down any pal® fronds at all, nor to deliver any to us* We, in spite of all those occurrences and In spit# of the fact that it 1 © our fir® belief that these communistic activities are not happening just of themselves, but at the deliberate instigation of sowe person in the bade ground, are averse to talcing any direct action to protect our gardens from damage, or evaa pr o«rve our rigbtfuX shares for ouraelres, although we could do this In nortaal cirou stance* 0 &gt;y sending artsad servants to overawe the rebellious fellahs}, until we have reported the natter In detail to Tour axcellency and have asked you to refer the whole unfortunate business to those la authority la Iraq who are our neighbours and a friendly governmant, pointing out thatthat the date season is approaching and we cannot leave these evil stirrers of the peace to play havoc with our gardens and that before our very eyes. At the same time we would like to draw Your Excellency’s attentionto one important fact, namely that in a short time, we, under normal circumstance^ and in the ordinary form of procedure, will have to send our local representative (Agent) to inspect the dates and make advance contracts ('thaman') with the fellaheen of our gardens, on our behalf as is the usual custom. I fear that if matters remain in the state they are in at present, the rebellious fellahs will commit acts of open violence and sabotage which we are all anxious to avoid. These disturbers of the peace do not apparently wish to arrive at any settlement and they would seem to be encouraged in their communis tic activities by the fact that the local autho rities appear powerless to stop the trouble or prevent the ring leaders from extending it. I shall therefore be highly obliged if you will,give your kind consideration in this strange out break which has clearly been engineered by some person or persons well up in the methods of an 'Agent Provo cateur” • We are quiiJe confident that our friendly neighbours the Iraq Government will take up this matter vigorouslyiput of their high consideration and sense of justice and will take all necessary steps to terminate all the sources of trouble. Lastly I would ask Your Excellency to give your best assistance in bringing the facts of this clearly to the authori ties concerned.Translation of letter dated the 4 th Rabi Awal 1352 (26th June 1933) from the Shaikh’s Agent Salman Bin Mohammed As-Salman, Fao, to His Sxce lenoy ikx Shaikh Ahmed Al-Jabir As- Subah, i«i aw With the hand of obedience I have received your high orders which you sent me with your servant the Nakhuda Abdul-Rasol, and everything has been noted by me* With regard to the share of the palm fronds which belong to Your Kxcellency I beg to inform you that I duly ordered the ^Fallaheen' to hand same over and I also arranged for the boat of the above men tioned Hakhuda tc start loading* He, as directed, began to ship, while most of the H Fellaheen” began to cut the palm fronds, but others led by ring leaders who were out to give trouble started putting about strange stories, and unfortunately were &amp;hle make the loyal ^Fallaheen' believe their false rumours* Sir, believe me, that your tenants are very ignorant men and know absolutely nothing about the real matters that count, so being persuaded they refused to deliver the portion of the palm fronds due under the law to you the landlord. In view of the near approach of the date season, should the rebellious fellahs persist in making trouble, and not to be checked in some way, grave injury will be done to the rights and profits of both landlord and tenant. Indeed it is clear to me that the troubles are already extending. I could not write earlier to Your lilxcellency and give you details of these disturbances because I was engaged in trying to combat ignorance and show the tenants the unwisdom of their ways.I sent persons to persuade the rebels but I do not find a single wise man among them so I have been compelled to refer the whole matter to Tour njccellency, because the boat is delayed and we are expecting your orders* * j^pte by the ^ ollticel Agent. The rumours according to the Shaikh which were put about were that the Iraq Government were going to support the fellahs against the Shaikh of Kuwait who was going to be deprived of his Kao estates, and that they would be divided up among existing Fallahsen*Confidential* No. 172.

Agrarian troubles on Shaikh’s Fao Estate * Sir, Ji 7^ With reference to ray telegram No* 169 dated the 25th July 1933, and previous correspondence. g # i have the honour to forward translation of a letter No. R/3/l685 dated the 24th July 1953 which I have received from His Excellency the Shaikh. The Shaikh's letter gives a fairly clear picture of how the trouble started, and the stiuation at Fao at the time of writing. Xxx an interview which the Shaikh had with me on the same date that the letter was written, he expressed his belief that some person or persons (he hinted strongly that it was the Mutasarrlf Basra) had deliberately stirred up his tenants to act as they were doing, for political reasons. The Shaikh added that the ring leaders consisted of three of his fellahs (a) Jasslm al Saleh (b) Saleh al Mujalli (c) A third person (name not yet reported) who had managed to get a fol owin of •=° ilie his fellaheen, of whom about half were definitely in 1 »acrue with the ring leaders and half were at hertI Wo \ -( 2 )- heart still loyal, but were being compelled to obey the orders of the ring leaders by process of victimi zation, etc* 6 * Further that the ring leaders mentioned in paragraph 5 above had engaged one Ibrahim Naji a lawyer of Basra to watch their interests, and according to Mr* Gabriel the Shaikh’s Basra Lawyer were challenging the Shaikh to try and evict them or force them to pay rental, etc., which in the present case is paid in the form of a recognized share on all dates, palm fronds, fruit, vegetables, lucerne grass, etc., etc*, which are grown on the property* 7 # r The Shaikh added that according to Mr* Gabriel, should he (the Shaikh) attempt to take the case to the Basra Courts, which is what the fellaheen evidently wanted him to do, the defence would plead ” Denial that he (thej &gt;haikh) was the rightful landlord and he would be asked ri ght in 'Taou'. 3*e* * -produce Tapu^ &gt;apersl* These as has been reported elsewhere, the Jhai h does not possess* A long legal case would then result, and there is no knowing how matters would turn out in view of the Iraq Government’s present attitude* for the above reasons both the bhaikh and his Lawyer Mr* Gabriel are deiinitely anxious to avoid going near the Law Courts, and wisH Instead that the utosarrlf should deal -dth the case ac.minis- tratlvely (as he has the right to and can very easily do) and order the matter to he settled hy ordinary ..tT-ihei methods' for which there exists a regular machinery in cases where garden owners have disputes with or desire to evict had fellahs or cultivators.-(3)- Lastly the Shaikh told me that following the normal custom among Basra garden owners when the dates are getting ripe he could have sent a strong party of 'Natours” or watchmen who would probably have been able to overawe the ring leaders and their following to-settle the above difficulty out of hand but as there was a possible risk of a 'clash” or a 'riot' in the present temper of the fellaheen he preferred to hold his hand lest he be accused by the Iraq authorities of sending Kuwait troops to his gardens, and causing disturbances. In other words . vV he is mor#- anxious to give no handle to the Hutasarrif who he feels is against him to bring an accusation / against him of interference and doing a high handed action. 10. The Shaikh at the end of our talk angrily said that the responsibility for this Kao business and all his other land, troubles lay at the door of His Majesty’s Government who by their procrastination and interminable discussions over the question of (a) Bashiyeh, (b) Kad&amp;aghiyeh, (o) taxation of his property and (d) customs export tax on produce des tined for his household had been responsible for producing ; wide-spread spirit of restlessness and today discontent among his fellaheen, who/nearly all believed that the Iraq Government would win in their contest with His Majesty’s Government and would eventually succeed in depriving him (the Shaikh) of all his properties on the Shatt al Arab in sq)ite of what looked like passing British support.

In particular, the correspondence concerns the court suit raised in Basra Court by members of al-Zuhair family complaining against the Ruler of Kuwait. The suit in question concerns a portion of the Shaikh’s Faddaghiya estate on Shatt al-Arab, and the Bashiya land to which members of al-Zuhair family lays claim to. According to the reports, the Faddaghiya estate was owned by Aisha, wife of Ahmad Pasha Al-Zuhair. Ahmad Pasha sold the estate to Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait although he did not hold a Power of Attorney from his wife at the time of the sale, in 1914.The Iraqi Government had requested via the British Embassy, Baghdad, for the Shaikh of Kuwait to submit to the Basra Court certain documents related to the case including a copy of Power of Attorney to prove the right of Ahmad Pasha Al-Zuhair to proceed with the selling.The volume includes a sketch map of the Faddaghiya estate with explanatory notes (ff 94-97). It also includes minutes of a meeting which was held at the Foreign Office in London to discuss issues related to the date gardens and the court suits. The correspondence contains reports that the
                           fellaheenon the Faw estate have started refusing to pay rent and were committing acts of sabotage. The Shaikh in turn argued that the British Government’s procrastination had caused him further troubles. Among the correspondents in the volume are the Political Resident, Bushire, and the Political Agent, Kuwait.The volume’s core correspondence covers the years 1932 and 1933.
