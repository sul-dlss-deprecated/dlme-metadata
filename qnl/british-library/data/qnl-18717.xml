                           Tigris,refers to letters from George Robinson, dated 2 July and 26 July respectively. He recounts visits to Shargah [Sharjah] and gives details of a complaint that was received by the Agent, Hadjee Yacoob, from a man named Gamin bin Geish. Tronson states that on 16 August a Debai [Dubai] buggarah [buggalow] had gone alongside one belonging to Gamin bin Geish and seized one of his crew. Tronson goes on to write that he and Hadjee Yacoob proceeded to Debai, where they met the Sheik [Shaikh Maktoum bin Buti], who appeared to be aware of the incident. Tronson states that he urged the Sheik to make an example of the parties concerned. Tronson reports that Hadjee Yacoob has since informed him that he has heard from the Sheik of Debai that the buggarah which had committed the assault on the Shargah boat had arrived at Debai and that the Sheik had punished the nacodah [nakhoda] and the crew. A note on the verso states that this letter was originally enclosed with letter no. 147, dated 17 October, from Commodore George Robinson.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023612308.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
