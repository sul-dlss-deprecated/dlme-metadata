MEMORANDUM ON THE USE OF THE FRENCH FLAG BY SUBJECTS OF THE SULTAN OF MASKAT. In 1891 reports were received from the Government of Bombay and from Abstract the Resident in the Persian Gulf that the French Consular officers at Aden, of Obokh and Zanzibar had, on numerous occasions, given French papers and the correspondence. French flag to Native vessels belonging to Sur and other places within the 1891-9 2. territory of the Sultan of Maskat. In passing on these reports to the Secretary * Secret despatch No. 92 (External), dated the of State,* the Government of India ^ t (T*m actio'o alleged to have been t.k.a b r the the 0 P iDi °“ that the action of Consuls at Obokh and Madagascar required veri- the I Tench Consul at Adenf amounted fic8fcl0n ^ to an assertion of protection over Oman, and that the French Government should be requested to put a stop to his proceedings. Shortly after the matter had been referred to Her Majesty’s Government, a further report was received from the Resident at Bushire to the effect that the Sultan of Maskat proposed himself to address a representation to the French Government, protesting against the issue of French flags and papers to vessels belonging to his subjects. His Highness represented that the sole object of the dhow-owners in assuming French protection was to obtain a cloke for slave-dealing operations. The Government of India, while holding that it was undesirable that the Sultan should address a protest direct to the French Government, informed the Resident that the use of the French flag by Maskat subjects could have no effect as against His Highness. The Sultan, it was averred, “ has full authority to punish any of his subjects who may infringe the laws of his country, whatever flag or papers they may have accepted ; and he may safely take any steps he pleases to uphold his jurisdiction in his own waters over such of his subjects as have got French flags ”. A copy of the Resident’s report and of the reply from the Government of India was for warded to the Secretary of State with Secret despatch No. 147 (External), dated the 25th August 1891. In replying to these two despatches, the Secretary of State forwarded { a copy t Secret despatch No. 441 , dated the 4th December of correspondence with the Foreign Office, 189L from which it appeared that the French Government had repudiated the action of the French Consul at Aden in granting French papers and flags to the Suri dhows, and had given an assurance that it would not be repeated. It appeared, however, from further reports received from Bombay and Bushire that the statement regarding the grant of flags and papers at Mada gascar and Obokh was not without foundation. These reports were forwarded to London with Secret despatches Nos. 46, 66 and 98 (External), dated, respec tively, the 23rd March, 4th May and 7th June 1892. The subject was again brought to the notice of the Government of India in 1894 — 96 . 1894 in connection with the appointment of a French Vice-Consul at Maskat. The Sultan, having reason to believe that this appointment was likely to be made, was considerably disturbed at the prospect. He anticipated, in fact, that the only object of sending a French Consular representative to Maskat was to assert French protection over the Arabs of Sur who had accepted French flags and papers. The Resident referred the matter to the Government of India, and was informed that, in the event of the French Vice-Consul putting'forward such a claim, the Sultan should be advised to “ refer him to the Declaration, dated the 10th March 1862, respecting the independence of Maskat and Zanzibar, and inform him that the assertion of French protection over Suri boats in Oman waters would be a contravention of that Declaration ”. The correspondence was reported to the Secretary tf State in Secret despatch2 1897 — 99 . 'No. 160 (External), dated the 4th September 1894, and the instructions issued by the Government of India were approved by Her Majesty’s Government in Mr. Eowler’s despatch No. 48 (Secret), dated the 19th October 1894 ; which, it is to be noted, was written after consultation with the Foreign Office. In the meanwhile a circumstantial report was received from Major Sadler • Secret despatch No. 218 (External), dated the ^t Maskat to the effect that the import- 26 th December i89t. ation of slaves to Oman by Suri dhows carrying the French flag was still actively carried on, and Her Majesty’s Government were informed* accordingly. In April 1895, however, it was stated on the authority of the Commander of a French war vessel (the “ Troude ”) that the practice of granting the French flag and papers to these dhows had been discontinued. Whatever value may have been attached to this statement was minimised by the events of the ’succeeding year, when the Political Agent reported the seizure of two Suri dhows, flying the French flag, with a cargo of slaves on board. M. Ottavi, the French Vice-Consul, protested against the detention of these vessels ; and although the dhows were captured ‘in the territorial waters of the Sultan, and the ov ners were knowm to be His Highness’s subjects, the jurisdiction of the French Vice-Consul over them was not questioned, and the vessels, together with the owners and the slaves, were handed over to M. Ottavi for disposal. The matter was reported to the Secretary of State in Secret despatch No. 15 (External), dated the 27th January 1897. In the meantime a report of these seizures and of the attitude of the French Vice-Consul had been submitted to Her Majesty’s Government through the Admiralty, and Lord Salisbury + Africa No. 288, dated the 22nd December 1896. directe( ^ the British Ambassador in Paris to address the French Government on the subject. “ Her Majesty’s Government feel sure ”, the Ambassador was directed to say, “ that the Government of the Republic will agree with them in wishing that persons guilty of so gross an abuse of the French flag as the owner and master of the dhow should have been brought to justice, and that the slaves, who were sheltered by the flag, should have been rescued from their fate ”: and he was also instructed to enquire whether the instructions discontinuing the grant of i rench flags and papers to Suri dhows were still in force. The only result of this reference was a disclaimerj on the part of the French : Secret d^tch from Secretary of State, No. 12 , Ambassador that there had ever been any dated the 2ud April lay?. intention of discontinuing the practice. In July 1897, an opportunity was taken to repeat the instructions con tained in Sir H. M. Durand’s letter of 4th August 1891. In August 1897, the Governqient of India again referred the matter to Her Majesty’s Government [Secret despatch No. il7 (External), dated the 4th August 1897], and suggested that the attitude now adopted by the French Government (namely, their intention to continue the practice of granting French flags and papers to Maskat subjects) was inconsistent with their previous admission that the action of their Vice-Consul at Aden in granting such papers was incorrect. On receipt of this communication, Her Majesty’s Government directed§ § Fide despatch from Secretary of state, No. 36 Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris to (Secret), dated the 29th October i897. place the matter again before the French Government. The reply of the French Ambassador was to the effect that the admission in the case of the Vice-Consul at Aden was not of general application. In the meanwhile a suggestion, emanating from the Foreign Office, was put forward to the effect that the Sultan should be advised to institute a distinctive flag for the vessels of his subjects, and to “ issue orders prohibiting the flying of ^any other on their ships”. This suggestion was put to the Political Agentat Maskat, who gave his opinion that, so long as the French flag continued to he granted to Maskat subjects, the prescription by the Sultan of a special flag for the use of his subjects would he productive of no good result, unless His Highness were assured of the active support of the British Government in asserting his authority over those of his subjects who claimed French protection. In forwarding this report to the Secretary of State, the Government of * Secret despatch to secretary of state, No. 59 , India asserted thcii opinion that no dated the sist March J898. effective measures for the suppression of the slave trade can he adopted unless and until the French authorities at Aden and elsewhere discontinue the practice of supplying french flags and papers to Maskat subjects ”, and they urged that steps should be taken to secure the discontinuance of the practice. In the year 1898, events occurred which indicated that the uncertain policy adopted by the British Government towards the Sultan was having an unfor tunate effect. The French Vice-Consul having gained considerable influence over the Sultan, induced him to lease the port of Bunder Jisseh to the French Government as a coaling station, and to adopt other measures inimical to British interests. It was found necessary to remind the Sultan of his treaty obligations in a forcible manner, and an ultimatum was presented to him containing, among other provisions, a demand that, to prevent the infringement of his rights, he should order all his subjects to use a distinctive flag, and “ should explain that, after the issue of such an order, the grant by the officer of a foreign Power of a foreign flag and the assertion by such officer of the right to protect in the dominions of Your Highness any of Your Highness’s own subjects is an instigation of such subject to disobey the lawful order of his own Sovereign, and if such instigation is made by a French official, it is an infringe ment of the Declaration w hich w T as entered into in the year 1862 by the Govern ments of England and France to respect the Sultan’s independence ”. This demand w T as stated to he the outcome of the correspondence which had passed between the Government of India and Her Majesty’s Government on the subject of the French flag; and particular reference was made to the Secretary of State’s Secret despatch No. 48, dated the 30th December 1898. This des- patch contained a letter from the Foreign Office, dated the 20th December 1898, in which the opinion of Lord Salisbury is given at some length. Discussing the suggestion that the French Government should he asked to desist from granting the &amp; French flag to Maskat-owned vessels, Lord Salisbury considered that “ there may be difficulties in following this line of procedure. Her Majesty’s Govern ment have no positive authority or unimpeachable locus standi entitling them to represent the matter to the French Government, seeing that Maskat is not a British Protectorate, and that they have received no request from the Sultan to do so. It would he possible to found the representation on the ground that the Sultan had by treaty given to this country pow r er to search and detain Maskat vessels in connection with the suppression oi the slave trade, and that Her Majesty’s Government could not allow the assumption of the French flag by such vessels to interfere with the exercise of a right thus formally delegated to them. The correspondence between the French Vice-Consul and the Sultan show r s that the answer to such a representation would be that the Sultan and his predecessors had allowed the assumption of the flag for years; that this constant practice had created a right which was no longer open to question that the flag was, in fact, granted and accepted with the permission of the Sultan—an independent Sovereign ; and that Her Majesty’s Government must address their representation to His Highness/ This position would point the way for the French Vice-Consul to represent to the Sultan that the abandon ment of the French flag would put the vessels of the Suris at the mercy of every British cruiser; that their trade would be practically ruined; and that his Suri subjects w^ould no doubt rebel sooner than submit. It appears not unlikely that the Sultan would fall ip with this view, and openly anounce that the French flag was granted with his permission.“The proposal that the Sultan should prescribe to his subjects the ex clusive use of a distinctive Maskat flag was made with the object of avoiding this position. The usefulness of the proposal does not depend on the Sultan being able to enforce it. On the contrary, if, after the issue of such orders, any Maskat subject accepted the French flag, the French authorities would by its grant have abetted such subject in disobeying the positive orders of his Sovereign, and Her Majesty’s Government would be in a strong position for announcing that they would be unable to recognise the validity of the grant. “ But in order to produce this position, it is necessary that the Sultan should issue the proposed order before any communication is addressed to the French Government, on account of the possibility of the French Vice-Consul being able in any other case to induce His Highness to declare that the flag is granted with his permission. “ At the present time, Her Majesty’s Resident at Maskat appears to have a powerful means to persuade the Sultan to issue the suggested order. His Highness’s correspondence with the French Vice-Consul shows that he very strongly resents the French contention, on which the French authorities con sistently act, that the owner or master of a dhow under the French flag becomes a French-protected person, even in Maskat territory. It could he represented to the Sultan that the right way to prevent his subjects from passing in ever increased numbers under French protection is to order them not to take the French flag In the same despatch was enclosed a Memorandum by the Law Officers of the Crown, dated the 4th August 1898, in which the opinion was expressed that ' the Arab slave traders, to whom these permits (i.e., to fly the French flag) are granted, do not become French subjects, and the allegation that they become French-protected persons is, it would appear, merely colourable. It is possible that they acquire this character by French law, but in order to validate the claim to fly the French flag from the point of view of international law, they should be so in reality. The subject is one on which there is an almost entire absence of authority, but the claim of the French Government seems to us to he unsustainable on principle As a result of the ultimatum the Sultan, while complying with the other demands pressed upon him, wrote to the French Consul informing him that “ we do not recognise the right of France to exercise jurisdiction over our subjects residing in or visiting our dominions whether they are in possession of French papers or not ”, and that the practice of granting French protection to his subjects at Sur was contrary to the spirit of the Declaration of 1862. At the same time he wrote to the heads of the Jenebeh tribe at Sur recommending them to return their French flags and adopt their original red flag again. In commenting on this declaration on the part of the Sultan, Her Majesty’s Government expressed* their opinion that “ no exception need be taken to the inti mation made by the Sultan to the French Consul refusing to recognise the right of France to exercise jurisdiction over His Highness’s subjects while residing in or visiting his dominions, provided that Article IV+ of the French Treaty with Maskat of 1846 is not contravened”. * Secretary of State’s Secret despatch No. 14, dated the 21st April 1899. f “ The subjects of the Sultan of Maskat actually in the service of the French shall enjoy the same privileges which are granted to the French them selves ”. (This is of course not intended to limit the juris diction of the Sultan over his subjects.) It would seem, however, that though Her Majesty’s Government were ready to applaud the Sultan’s determination in refusing to recognise French protection, the French Government were June 8 i 899 tarjr ° f State 8 telegralll, dated tbe 24th not equally ready to accept the situation. For in June} 1899 we find the French Ambassador complaining that the British Consul at Maskat had disputed the validity of French protection granted to a Maskat dhow, and had demanded from the Sultan that he should enforce the discontinuance of the use of the French flag by his subjects, promising the assistance of a British man-of-war5 As a consequence of this complaint, the Foreign Office requested that, without previous reterence to them, nothing should be done in the way of forcible inter- to vention by a British man-of-war. The « Telepram tu Secretary of State, dated the 12th ° July 1899. • complaint was reported* by Major Faeran » to be unfounded. In December 1899, a despatchf was received from the Secretary of State in t No. 47 (Secret), dated the 24 th Noyember 1899. which certain suggestions w r ere made as to the steps which might be taken to neutra lise the effect of the grant of the French flag. The suggestions were : (1) That the Sultan should make an ordinance compelling every subject of Maskat who owns a ship to register it as a Maskat ship, and sail it under the Maskat flag. (2) That the Sultan should declare that he would not in his territory, after a date to be fixed, recognise any protection or naturalisation thereafter conferred on his subjects otherwise than with his sanction or under the provisions of his Treaties. (3) That the use of the British flag should be extended so as to outbid the French Consul. At the same time it was requested that, with a view to the possibility of coming to an arrangement with the French Government, a more precise account should be furnished of the modus operandi of the French, and of the evidence forthcoming to prove a connivance on their part in the slave trade, or the exact details in respect of which they could be held to fail in their obli gations under the Brussels Act, Articles 25 and 30. The despatch was sent to the Resident at Bushire for report. In the interval before the report w^as furnished,J the situation was further 1900. developed by the Sultan’s offering to sign a letter definitely requesting the British Government to intervene with the French Government on his behalf in order to “ effect the removal of the flags now in use and the discontinuance of the practice’* of granting the French flag to his subjects. This request, as Captain Cox pointed out, seemed to supply the locus standi required by Lord Salisbury in the Foreign Office letter of December 20th, 1898, § Telegram to Secretary of state, dated the 22 nd and Her Majesty’s Government were, ii*y 1900 . therefore, asked§ whether they were prepared to act. t It was eventually transmitted to the Secretary of State with Secret despatch No. 102 (External), dated the 20th July j 900. It contained a full account of the modus operandi of the French, giving ample evidence to show that the French flag-holders had engaged in the slave trade with fche connivance of M. Ottavi, and that the provi sions of Articles 25 to 30 of the Brussels Act had been systematically disregarded. While this reference was being considered in London, the Sultan took matters into his own hands and visited the French proteges at Sur. His visit resulted in the presentation to him of a solemn declaration by the two tribes at Sur, including all the holders of the French flag, in which they declared their wish and intention to return all French papers and flags and return to their allegiance to the Sultan. Three of the flag-holders who had received their papers from the French Consul actually handed them over to the Sultan for return to M. Ottavi. The Sultan thereupon issued an edict to the effect that he would not recognise in his territories (in the hands of his subjects) French flags and papers, and would “ not forgive ” any one who took them without his permission and in accordance with the terms of his Treaties. This edict, it was pointed out, was in accordance with the suggestion made in the Secret despatch from the Secretary of State, No. 47, dated the 24th November 1899, and was also a tardy compliance with the orders contained in the ultimatum of January 1899, which were based on instructions from the Foreign Office. Her Majesty’s Governmeut did not, however, see their way to supporting the Sultan in the position which he had assumed, and in a telegram, dated the 20th July 1900, they directed that the “Sultan should be advised to make it6 clear that the edict affected only the issue of flags and papers to his subjects after the date of its communication to the French Consul; while in regard to those issued before that date, any doubtful or disputed case would be the subject of examination between himself and the Trench Government M. Gambon having intimated that in future no papers of protection would be given, and that the existing papers should be carefully examined, so as to exclude those for the grant of which no just cause existed, a French man-of-war was despatched to Maskat with the ostensible object of conducting this examin ation and of investigating the question whether any dhows with French papers were implicated in the slave trade. The actual proceedings of the Commander of the French vessel were Telegram to Secretary of State, dated the 26th reported by Captain COX to be of a Very August 1900. different nature. He made no enquiries into the question whether the French flag-holders were implicated in the slave trade, but directed his endeavours mainly towards intimidating the Sultan into returning to the dhow-owners the French papers which they had handed over to him: and to persuading His Highness to receive as an intermediary between His Highness and the French Consul one Abdul Aziz whom the Sultan had dismissed from his service. The attitude maintained by the Sultan in this situation was most satisfactory. He persisted in his refusal to receive Abdul Aziz, and declined to return the papers to their owners. The French vessel then visited Sur, and apparently persuaded some of the Sheikhs to recant from their undertaking given to the Sultan, and to plead that they had given it under pressure. Two of the owners of the papers, however, who had handed them over to the Sultan, came into Maskat and, after receiving their papers back from the Sultan, handed them over to M. Ottavi. On her way to Sur, the “ Drome ” met and stopped several Suri dhows proceeding to Basrah, and compelled them to come to Maskat flying the tri-colour. It is important to notice that, in the course of this incident, no exception was taken either by M. Ottavi or by the French Commander to the terms of the Sultan’s edict, and that M. Ottavi stated, with a somewhat remarkable divergence from the truth, that he had never claimed to give the flag-holders protection. It was not until the “ Drome ” had left Maskat that the Government of • Secretary of State’s telegram, dated the 20th India Were authorised* to COUVey to September 1900. ‘ Captain Cox the approval of Her Majesty’s Government of his action in supporting the firm and becoming attitude of the Sultan and in protesting against the French demands. 1901. A second French vessel (the “ Catinat ”) called at Maskat in December 1900, and took the opportunity to visit Sur. The French Commander is said to have made much of the French flag-holders, and to have assured them that he had settled the matter of the flags with the Sultan in a satisfactory way, and that His Highness had agreed to let them all remain French subjects. In April 1901, Captain Cox suggested that the Sultan might be advised to issue a further notification, in continuation of his edict above referred to, to the effect that, from a date to be fixed, none of his subjects would be permitted to fly within his territories or in his territorial waters any foreign flag except with the written authority of the Sultan: and that any one acting in contraven tion of this order Tvould be liable to fine or other punishment. This suggestion was forwarded + to His Majesty’s Government with the + Secret despiitch to Secretary of State, No. 69 remark that, in the opinion of the Govern- (External), dated tbe 9 th May 1901. ment of India, the Sultan would be within his rights in issuing the notification. But they required ihe authority of His Majesty’s Government before advising the Sultan to issue it. That authority has not yet been accorded.7 The subject of the increase of French influence in Oman was again brought into prominence in the summer of the present year, when Captain Cox, with Vide papers forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s a geological expert deputed, by the GoV“ letter No. 26 m., dated the 27 th June 1901 . ernment of India, visited the neighbour hood of Sur in order to examine a coal reef said to be situated in the vicinity. The exploration was conducted with the full knowledge and consent of the Sultan; it met with considerable opposition from the local tribes, which Captain Cox attributes, apparently with justice, to the adverse influence of the French Consul and Abdul Aziz, who arrived at Sur in a French vessel (the “ Internet”) a few days before the British party, and stirred up the tribes against them. On the 7th June 1901, a telegram was received from the Secretary of State, intimating that the Foreign Office considered it impossible to maintain that French protection and the use of the French flag are limited to the high seas and to ports outside the territory of the Sultan of Maskat: and that the issue by the Sultan of a notification, forbidding the use of the French flag by his subjects in Maskat territory or territorial waters, was thought to be undesirable. In view of the previous declarations made by His Majesty’s Government on the subject, an explanation was asked for in the Viceroy’s telegram of 30th June, in which a reference was made to Sir H. M. Durand’s letter of 11th August 1891, and a hope was expressed that the Government of India might be permitted to give the Sultan an assurance to the effect that the assertion by the French Government of a claim to jurisdiction over, and protection of, His Highness’s subjects in Maskat territory and territorial waters would be regarded as incompatible with the Sultan’s independence, and that the British Government would support him in resisting any such claim. This hope was reiterated in our Secret (External) despatch No. 128, dated the 1st August 1901, to which no reply has yet been received. In the meantime the Government of India pointed out to Captain Cox the desirability of the Sultan’s strengthening his authority over his subjects at Sur, whether French proteges or not, and suggested certain measures (e.g., the entertainment of a force of sepoys at Sur and the purchase of an armed steam yacht) which might be taken with that object. The latest report from Captain Cox on the subject indicates that the Sultan, while anxious to follow his advice in this matter and to establish a strong administration at Sur, has hitherto been deterred from taking a strong line by the fear of French interference on behalf of their Suri proteges. Captain Cox has not yet communicated to His Highness the views of His Majesty’s Government as to the admissibility of the French claim to jurisdiction over their proteges in Maskat territory, and has expressed his conviction that it would be most prejudicial to British interests and to his own personal influence for him to do so. The only further paper which needs notice is the letter from the Foreign Office to Sir E. Monson, dated the 14th August 1901, which contains M. Gambon’s view of the situation. M. Gambon’s memorandum was chiefly directed towards showing that the papers which had been granted to the dhow- owners at Sur and elsewhere had been granted in accordance with the provisions of the Brussels Act, and that the charge that these dhows were engaged in the slave trade was unfounded. The memorandum also contains a distorted account of the Sultan’s proceedings with the French flag-holders at Sur, which were, M. Cambon was at pains to point out, inspired and supported by the British Consul. The memorandum has been sent to Captain Cox for report. The practical outcome of the foregoing abstract may be summarised as Summary, follows:— (a) The practice of granting French flags and papers to the subjects of V ; the Sultan at Maskat has grown up during the past ten years, and has produced a state of affairs which constitutes a standing menace to the Sultan’s independence, and hampers him in the exercise of his authority.8 (£) There is sufficient evidence to show that the French fla^-holders have engaged in the slave trade under cover of the French flag and probably with the connivance of the French Consul, and that flags and papers have been granted irregularly to persons who are not properly entitled to them. These charges have been laid before the French Government from time to time, and reparation has been promised. But the practices complained of have not been discontinued. (c) The Government of India have on several occasions caused the Sultan to be informed that he is at full liberty to uphold his own jurisdiction in his own territory or territorial waters over those of his subjects who have taken trench flags and papers, and that the assertion of French protection over Suri boats in Maskat waters would be regarded as a contravention of the Anglo-French Declaration of 18b2. This principle was first announced to the Sultan in 1891; was again affirmed with the approval of Her Majesty’s Government in 1894; was implicitly asserted in the suggestion made by the Foreign Office in 1897; and was finally enjoined in the ultimatum presented to the Sultan in 1899. It was not until June 1901 that instructions were received from His Majesty’s Government which cast a doubt upon the tenability of the position which had been assumed by the Government of India. (d) Neither the French Government nor the French Consular represent ative have ever asserted in so many words the principle that the possession of French flag or papers by a Maskat subject entitles him to the position of a French protege in Maskat territory: but, as will be seen hereafter, the French Consul has frequently acted on this assumption. (e) The Sultan has actually issued a notification to the effect that he will not recognise in his territories (in the hands of his subjects) French flags and protection papers, and will punish any of his subjects who takes them without his written permission. He has also desired to issue a second notification forbidding any of his subjects to fly within his territory or territorial waters any foreign flag except under his written authority. The first notification has, under the instructions of His Majesty’s Gov ernment, been made to apply only to cases in which French flags or papers may be taken after issue of the notification : that is to say, it has no effect against the dhow-owners who at present possess French flags and papers, although the latter are only valid for one year. The issue of the second notification has been prohibited under the instructions of His Majesty’s Government. (/) The Sultan has solicited, or at least shown himself ready to solicit British intervention with the French Government in his behalf • but though he has acted consistently in accordance with the advice given to him by the British Consul, he has been given no assistance in his difficulties with the French, and has received no assurance of support in the position which he has taken up by the advice of the British representative. Extent to which French iurisdiction has een claimed and admitted in the past. i' It will be convenient at this point to examine how far the view that the protection afforded to these Suri dhow-owners by the possession of French fla°*s and papers does not include protection by land and in Maskat territorial waters has been acted upon in the past. The first instance on record was the case of the seizure of the tw o dhow T s (the Salama and the Saad) by Commander Baker * Secret despatch to Secretary of state, No. 15 in 1896.* In that case, as has already been (External), dated the 27th January 1897. noted, the French Vice-Consul claimed1 aonBOBBauBnUHiH (® f 9 jurisdiction over the two dhows, although they were seized in Maskat waters, and his jurisdiction was admitted. In 1897 two further instances occurred (vide * Secret ^espat-ch to Secretary of State, No. 1 Major Fagan’s letter* No. 428, dated (External), dated the 5th January 1899. the 25th November 1898). In the one case an African slave who had been kidnapped by a buggalow from ^ur flying the French flag, having applied to the British Consulate 'for freedom, was refer red to the Sultan. The accused was summoned and came to Maskat; but the French Consul interfered and claimed jurisdiction over the accused, and His Highness was consequently unable to take any action in the matter. In the other case, a native of Maskat, who had procured French papers at Obokh, was asked by the Sultan to produce them, and, on his refusing to do so, was confined in the Sultan’s prison. The French Vice-Consul protested against his arrest, and the Sultan was compelled to release him. In none of these three cases does the British Consul appear to have disputed the French claim to jurisdiction. The case of Salim-bin-Saad marked a change in the policy of the British e. a . . . Consul. In this case a collision having Vide enclosure No. 5 to Secret despatch to *11 i-icoi Secretary of State, No. 19 (External), dated the Occurred 1U the neighbourhood Ot Sur be- 2 nd February 1899 . tween a sambhuk owned by Salim-bin- Saad, a French protdge, and a buggalow belonging to a British Indian trader, the matter was represented to the British Consul by M. Ottavi, who sent the complainant to the British Consul. Major Fagan finding that Salim-bin-Saad was a native of Sur, and that the collision occurred in Maskat territorial waters, informed M. Ottavi that, in view of the question pending between Her Majesty’s Government and the French Republic regarding the right of France to exercise jurisdiction within the Sultan’s dominions over subjects of His Highness who had obtained the right to fly the French flag, he “only accepted M.
