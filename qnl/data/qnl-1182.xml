Most of the correspondence is between the Political Residency in Bushire, the Political Agencies in Bahrain and Kuwait, the High Commissioner in Baghdad, the Colonial Office in London, the Government of India, Ibn Sa'ud himself and his delegates.The majority of the volume is concerned with cross-border raids and counter raids between Iraq and Najd and efforts to put a stop to them. With the British attempting to mediate, the raids were carried out by the Ikhwan and tribal groups in Iraqi and Kuwaiti territory, including sections of the 'Ajman, Mutayr, Shammar, Awazim, 'Utaibah, Harb, and Dahamshah tribes. The documents reflect the divergent opinions among British officials on what British policy should be in the region as well as the inadequacies of the borders as they were defined. The volume ends with efforts to set up a tribunal to settle claims of compensation between the two governments as stipulated in the Bahra Agreement.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ikhwan, military and religious brotherhood</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Shammar (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>'Ajmān (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Muṭayr (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>'Awāzim (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Ḥarb (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>ʻUtaybah (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Dahamshah (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000226#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000226#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000226#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
