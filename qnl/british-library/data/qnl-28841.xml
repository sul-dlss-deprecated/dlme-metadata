This was no question of li&amp;es and dis likes and he was, sc he said, continually asking it clear to all who sought his advice that the Arabs must ail the allied cause In every possible way. Mention was rmde of Sir Percy Cox and the northern fron tier and his relations with Kuwait end Bahrain and he asked why I lied not visited him when he was in camp with Shaikh Haurd/3 V llamd bln lae al Khalifah ana Shaikh \hmid tin Jabir as Subah at Mmurm in ZhNia^b^r 1*9$ ;-&lt;?ar ^hcn he had aaoordad na pondatlon to an ter hi* territory.

He said ho understood and had euspoctod that that was the reason* .Me Jrev/ r ; y attention to the excellent relations « which now ©listed between his country and Kuwait and then lectured is© on how to deal with Arabs* Force and dlploaacy alone were necessary he laalntainod f by their skilful use you could do what you liked with the arab, it seeded that force was to be preferred and diplomacy was only to be called In whoa adequate force to achieve the object was leering* The conversation was entirely one sided and lasted the best part of three quarters of an hour. At last the end oarae and he stopped speaking and seamed to be rather exhausted by hid effort for he complained of the heat and then we talked of the tribesmen camped outside his ^ates and how they came from far and near and how t ©y lived as his **u©et» for three days and each party came to receive his customary gift of from one thousand to fifteen thousand rials and a quota of rice etc* Much as I would have liked to rettaifi I felt that thi time had com to ask permission to leave and it was granted with a pleasant smile and then X noticed hi* eyes, one very bright and keen, and the other clouded with whet looked like a cataract. He asked me what I proposed to do and suggested that I went to Al K&amp;raj to see the egricultural developments there and HesMi Ualhm was aumoned and directed to see that I went Immediately after lunch and that as he, Hcshdi, was busy with the post Yusuf Yasin f 0 nephew Tahir Iff end!

The lad lletmed to his ;.actsr f 3 orders and ran off to have thaa executed which they were in a remarkably snort space of time and he returned to announce that dinner awaited our pleasure. After dinner we returned to the courtyard and drank coffee arid I had an opportunity of talking to Heesein Al threini the Paekard Agent and Ibn Saud*© Agent in Beirut who had been introduced to &amp;e at dinner but with whom 1 had not so far had much conversation.

The natmbers of the household eat on the I divans on the right and the Amir Abdullah bin A Mur riahman JTis Majesty*s brother, the Amirs ncud and Faisal on the loft, I was Introduced to the Amir AMullsh by the Amir feud end parked myself on the sofa on the left of the 'throne*, I talked to the Amirs in Arabic and as they were some fifty feet away from me and everyone else sat like mutes it wag not particularly enjoyable but ell went well and there were no embaransing pauses, Tome twenty minutes were passed in this manner while the row of slaves behind the princes look ed steadily to their front then a commotion to my rear drew my attention to a number of people entering the sta^e from a snail doorway immediately behind me and I was surprised to see Ibn Saud appear suddenly from what seamed to me to be quite the most inappropriate direction for we all sat facing the entrance to the lift up which I believed all of us thought he would come. We all rose and His Majesty oamt for ward end I advanced to greet him end shook hands, E« sat • down on the padded chair and we resumed our seats, not for very long however for we had scarcely said two or three words on the subject of AX Karaj before dinner was announced and Xbn ft&amp;ud asking me If I was ready led the way from one roof to another past blind men reciting the Koran and pro ceeded by a lad walking backwards with a canaer of burning sandle/«* sanale wood prasuniably last, aay foul odours should osaall oae # s aostrila* Aw oi £cr pci© ’In^ 3©v©rfiX ucirrow doorways w© found oupsoXvna on a scpaolou® roof c^rt^id with oarpate and with uii© dinner laid out on a lone whi-e table cloth in the centre.
