In the meantime, I received a letter from Abdulla giving us good news of the occupation of Medina and I sent him a good reply and also to Sherriff Husain. We hoped it would be a basis of a union between us and for tranquility and reform of Ara.b affairs and in conformity with the wishes of my friends, His Majesty’s Government. Afterwards, I received news of the departure of Sherriff Abdulla from Medina, and that he was prepared for movement against the tribes of Hajd. I (look upon the?) matter till it should have been (?ascertained) and now it has been ascertained, I wish to communicate it to you in order that, firstly, I may not be responsible; secondly, that you may have the opportunity to see the movement against the wishes of your Government, As regards his departure from Medina, he left with the remainder of the Turkish troops, together with the men from the neighbourhood of Medina and fro m li diffe rent parts(? in r an s la- ion)* (in •iginal) (?in iginal).

I heard they were (words undecypherable)* on account of inferioxity or fear, out on the contrary as a precaution againso theii previous and recent deeds, I am warning raidii and now matters have reached their extreme. When the British Government was engaged in time of war, we had left matters and given up many of our rights, out now I cannot excuse the Brit ish Government. If Sherrif is obedient to the orders of your V Government and follows them, then I am prepared to entrust settlement of the dispute between us to you under the necessary right which was as clear as the sun* So I hope that you will settle by arbitration between us with pre-emptive rights* If he is the aggressor, you can stop him* If I am the aggressor, you can stop me, and place the responsibility on whoever acts (group unde cypher able )* and commits aggression after the settlement of tie dispute, and what has encouraged me to address you is two things; firstly, God willing, I am guarding myself against aggression and fully believe in rny rights, which are biown to every one before as now, and the second thing is that trusting in God and then in you and your justice, there will be no (group undecypherable)* consequences according to what you promised me (corrupt group* ?ihat have been the) characteristic of your Government* If it is that Sherriff is out of your hands and he has no willingness to follow advice and you give me your definite reply, then I will defend my tribes and my rights and the responsibility will be on the disobedient.

It is not too much to say that no previous British Mission in Central Arabia has yielded such valuable results, both political and geographical. 3. ^ Politically, the results are at first sight of a negative nature, compared to the violent movements which have been excited elsewhere in Arabia ; the fact, however, that we have first hand information from a competent source, of the real feelings of the Ruler of Najd and his people during this crisis of their affairs is of the greatest permanent value. 4. Geographically, the positive results gained are of the greatest value ; a large area has been traversed for the first time by a European under conditions which enabled him to take notes and make enquiries with full acquaintance of the work of previous travellers. 5. Mr. Philby is now on his way to Egypt at my request to confer with the High Commissioner, preparatory to proceeding on leave which he has so well-earned and I am glad to have the opportunity of placing on record my appreciation of the ability and devotion to duty which he has displayed in the conduct of this Mission. 6 .

Between Bin Saud and lTin» Hussein the dispute is one of principle : aims of two are incompatible ffin Saud relies on his treaty with us to assist him to dominate Centra? Arabia fn as working to recover territory of former (? Wahabite) Empire VZ Hussem is seeking His Majesty’s Government’s support-diplomatic and other-to gam nominal hegemony over a loose system of autonomous Arab States thus securing Sunni pre-eminence. Both parties hope to refeive enlightenment from our decision m regard to Khurma dispute as they am uncertain of the policy of His Majesty’s Government. ^ J aie I am of opinion that, according to European standards, the balance of evidence favours King Hussein’s claim which has never been disputed by u S On the other band, a forcible assertion of King’s claim is liable precipitate a general conflagration as Bin Saud, through the Ikhwan, is now in possession of Khurma, and sectarian sentiment is much inflamed. 1 Concentration of Sheriffial levies to carry out operations against Ikhwan »&lt;y.

Prom—His Majesty's High Commissioner, Egypt, Cairo, »p 0 Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Foreign Office ; sent to Baghdad.) It is reported by King of Hedjaz that he has suggested to Bin Bashid that latter might, in case he has difficulties in obtaining them from Irac[, purchase supplies from Yenbo (Red Sea). This refers to your telegram No. 1613. 77 Telegram P., dated the 6th (received 7th) January 1919. From—His Majesty's High Commissioner, Egypt, Cairo, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Delhi. A conversation at Jeddah with the head of the deputation sent by Bin Rashid subsequently to Mecca, Mohammed-el-Negheirbi-el-Fatayah, is reported by Colonel Wilson. Man is intelligent and well acquainted with recent Arab politics and was for four years in College at Beyrout. He impressed Colonel Wilson as reliable although he is evidently a keen partisan of Ibn Rashid. There have been regular communications from Bin Saud to Medina according to him. Last September Ibn Rashid was informed by Fakhri that he (Fakhri) had an agreement with Bin Saud and was advised to make common cause with latter against Sheriffials. Through Ibn Saud it was that Fakhri heard of the secret negotiations between the Kin% and Ibn Rashid. He believes that, in collusion with Fakhri, Bin Saud desires to enter Medina and to possibly induce some of the Turkish troops to enter his service after taking possession of armament there. Reports as to the militancy of Wahabi movement which can only be checked by force and of its rapid progress are confirmed by him. Ikhwan have been joined by nearly all Ateibah and Muteir tribesmen and Bin Saud has declared, it is said, that until he has repeated his grandfather’s exploits at Mecca he will not rest. /.

No. 20. (5172/315.) KHUBMA. Jeddah, ^ r &gt; 4th December 1918.' I have the honour to forward herewith translations of the letter and telegram from King Hussein to myself referred to in my telegram No. W.-503, December 3rd, the original letter is being sent to the Arab Bureau by this mail. I felt it most desirable that Your Excellency should be informed as fully as possible at an early date and therefore telegraphed my views at leno-th (W.-504, December 3rd) as this despatch will not reach Cairo until December 13th. King Hussein appears to be really nervous of the consequences of the present Ikhwan activity and to this his appeal for British support is probably due. His statement that Great Britain had agreed to support him is, I understand, not a fact. (Note by Lieutenant-Colonel Cornwallis, dated 10th September on King Hussein’s letter to Your Excellency, dated 28th August 1918.) There appears to be only two courses open— (1) For His Majesty’s Government to send peremptory orders to Ibn Sand to withdraw all Ikhwan from Khurma informing him that in event of his refusal His Majesty’s Government will stop his supplies and subsidy and may be compelled to break relations with him altogether ; at the same time informing him of the King’s written guarantee (see my despatch No. 20, dated 24th November, to lour Excellency) and advising him. to accept the principle of a Suzerain. (2) For King Hussein and Ibn Saud to be left alone to fight the matter out between them. These two courses are really similar to the alternatives mentioned on page 3 of my note submitted to Your Excellency on 1st May 1918. ihe adoption of the first must, I think, entail His Majesty’s Government s approva o e “ Suzerain policy ”, the adoption of the second would possibly lead to a general upheaval in Arabia and make any settlement in the near futuie extieme y difficult.98 Tailing strong and successful pressure being put upon Ibn Baud now, I submit that King Hussein has no alternative but to put in the field against 4bn Baud all the forces he can collect, the situation is developing into a far too critical state for him to continue his defensive policy much longer ; y i Kin- Hussein has lost considerable prestige, Arabs regarding it as necessitated by fear and weakness and the longer he continues it the more Arabs will join the Akhvvan, either from necessity or because they consider Ibn Baud s the winning side, also the nearer the Akhwan will get to Mecca. It must always be remembered that if Emir Shaker’s forces receive a crushing defeat tlie Akhwan will probably reach the near neighbourhood of Mecca and capture Taif, they are now only some 90 miles away from the former town. It is worthy of note that well-informed Wahabis, who have no love for King Hussein, such as Mohamed Nasif, the sons of El Fadl (who were in prison at Mecca) state they would far prefer King Hussein s rule to that of Ibn Saud and give it as their opinion (which they say is generally shared) that the reason for King Hussein acting on the defensive and pursuing a weak nolicv in the Kburma affair is his earnest endeavour to prevent fighting between Arabs which would endanger the realization of bis struggle for eventual Arab Unity, They declare that as Ibn Saud s Emirate is based upon religion he could stop all Akhwan aggression if he wished to. ^ During the last two and-a-half years I have in letters to King Hussein and in numerous conversations with him “ whitewashed’* Ibn Saud and constantly urged conciliation on the former. What real proof has Ibn Saud given to show his entire loyalty to Great Britain? On the contrary—as stated in my despatch No. 20, dated 24th November 1918 to your Excellency—he appears to have threatened to sever relations with us in certain eventualities. If Ibn Saud has been throughout thoroughly loyal and straightforward ■ with us what is the origin of the information given against him throughout Arabia from Aden to Damascus and obtained from all kinds of independent sources ? I submit that it is extremely likely that Ihn Saud has sub rosa ” been trying to “ run with the hare and hunt with the hounds **; the only other explanation (and an extremely improbable one) is that there is a very highly organised system of propaganda working against him throughout Arabia. The great services rendered to the Allied cause by King Hussein’s revolt are well known and I submit that he has given numerous proofs of his steads fast loyalty to Great Britain and never have I heard that even his own enemies ever accused him of playing us false ; their only accusation is that he is too friendly and loyal with us. These are the two men between whom—as it appears to me —His Majesty’s Government must choose and choose quickly. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. Wilson, Colonel. His Excellency General Sir Reginald Wingate, G.C.B., G.C.V.Q., G.B.E., &amp;c., &amp;c., The Residency, Cairo, Copy. No. 332. His Excellency the British Agent, Jeddah. My dear friend, After dutiful respects I regret to tell Your Excellency that the attack on (he people of Dghabjah by the Akhwan which Shaker had referred to as being99 expected has been made on the main supply base which is 4 stations (le., 4 days ) distant from Mecca and 2 stations (days’) distant from Taif to the north. As a large quantity of supplies had luckily been sent to Shaker there 'ere only about 350 or 400 small sacks left in the above-mentioned base which were taken by them (Akhwan) who also took all things belonging to the guards and retired after suffering a heavy loss. How can it be said that the matter would not be extended if I had written the letter requested to I bn Saud. I must, therefore, be excused if I say it is not a case of a letter which I would return or object to write to him, because everybody knows, that when His Honour (Ibn Saud) killed Affas, a Sheikh of the Kuaqah, and sent me 4 horses afterwards as a present with one of his chief men called Saleh El Azl, which I returned, and refused to accept his letters before all the Arabs, no more than six and-a-half months passed befoie he icpented, took the necessary steps to satisfy me and asked my for giveness. This is sufficient (evidence) to judge both sides (i. e., whether to write a letter to Ibn Saud or not and whether or no to receive letters from him). The bad result to which I have referred in one of my recent telegrams is commencing. The mention of Great Britain’s support, on the occurrence of a rising or internal disorder in the country due to envy on the part of the Emirs or caused by enemy intrigues, in our criminal decisions (agreements) proves that such ^ a possibility was foreseen from the beginning. My purpose in mentioning this clause now is only to confirm my apprehension regarding the state of the country and its capacity for dealing (with such and similar occurrences). Therefore Great Britain should either inform Ibn Saud that if he will not disperse the muddayinah (Akhwan) as was stated in my last note and prevent Attiba from communicating with the villages of Nejd* (mentioned therein) in any way within the period of 35 days she will sever relations with him or must accept my withdrawal (resignation) absolutely. This is all I can do. It is necessary that Your Excellency with your great knowledge will look upon this matter as being of supreme importance which must be considered. Please accept my best compliments and respects. Yours most sincerely, 28-2-37— (2nd December 1918.) Hussein. Copy. Telegram No. 178. His Excellency the British Agent, Jeddah. I have with great pleasure received Your Excellency’s letterf of 1 st 4.0 .u ^ u , Q1Q December 1918 (27-2-37) in which you ™ informed us that His Majesty’s Govern ment will be pleased when it learns that I have ordered Shaker to avoid fight* ing as much as he can in spite of everything. I beg most respectfully to inform Your Excellency that there cannot be any further room whatsoever for patience after they have attacked us in a place not very far from the doors of Mecca. The safeguarding of the common 'interests compels me to say that the matter is now in the hands of Great Britain. Yours most sincerely, Hussein. 29-2-37 (3rd December 1918.) * Note. —As the words “and prevent Ateiba from communicHting with the villages of Nejd in any way ” appeared contradictory to King Hussein’s recently expressed view that intercourse between Hedjaz amt Nejd should be free and unhampered, 1 asked fora further explanation of these words by telephone. The King replied through Lis Private Secretary that he intended to refer to the particular villages (Akhwaa settlements) mentioned in his recent Note on Administration of the Emirates of Arabia (sent with my despatch No. 20 of 24th November).

Holy City of Medina has capitulated to Ring Hussein under terms of armistice with Turkey. Belay in bringing the garrison to comply with armistice terms has been due to its long isolation which necessitated our permitting interchange ot special communications with Constantinople. To give time for these period of armistice was prolonged locally. It should be observed that sacred character of city which contains tomb of prophet, rendered it; incumbent on King Hussein to secure its capitulation by arrangement and not by assault Seige operations had been confined to comparatively distant investment and since Turks drew their inner lines close round great mosque and used latter as their chief ammunition depot not a single shell could have been thrown into position without grave risk of the destruction of prophet s tomb.

(8.3.8-4).THE. KING 'HUSAIN - BIN SAUD CONTROVERSY. ( Note by Captain PMIhy 'i / 1. It occurred to me after our meeting of yesterday while thinking over the subject of our conversation that, as I took the liberty of dissenting decidedly from a specific proposal put forward by Wilson in connection with Central Arabian policy, I ought to submit to you in writing my reasons for so dissenting and my considered opinion on the matter under discussion. 2. First let me make it clear that I do not in any sense represent Wilson here; while I was in Arabia he generally supported my proposals and adhered to the policy previously laid down by Sir Percy Cox; subsequently when I presented my report on my mission he expressed a general approval of the sentiments therein expressed. Since then I have been out of touch with Arabian affairs and Wilson’s views and am therefore not in a position to understand any change of views on his part. His telegram makes it clear that he has changed his views and to that extent it was perhaps unfortunate that at the Conference of February 24th I expressed the opinion that I might speak with authority. I hope it will therefore be understaod that mine was but a voice crying from the wilderness with nothing to guide me but the special knowledge of Central Arabian politics which I think I may fairly claim to have acquiredacquired during my sojourn in Najd. 3. The alternatives considered by the Conference were:- (1) that the dispute between Ibn Saud and the Sharif should be taken out of the hands of the disputants and settled by His Majesty’s G-overnment by the appointment of a Boundary Commission; (2) that His Majesty’s G-ovemment should express a pious hope that its good offices in this direction would be accepted by both parties and should warn them that, if they were not, the parties would be left to fight out the issue subject to the proviso that His Majesty’s G-overnment would not tolerate an attack by Ibn Saud on any territory which falls indisputably within the limits of the Hijita* 4. Sir Reginald Wingate in the course of the discussion suggested a third alternative based on certain proposals submitted by Hogarth to the effect that the issue should be decided out of hand against Ibn Saud and that the latter should be informed that his subsidy would not be paid until it was fully established that he had accepted the adverse verdict with a dutiful grace. 5. This alternative was considered and definitely turned down as unsuitable. A vote was then taken on the other alternatives. I voted in a minority of one for (1) and (2) was eventually adopted on the showing that (1) was impossible unless the Sharif consented. 6. Wilson now objects to the decision arrived at:- (1) because he was not consulted (2) on financial grounds; (3) on the ground that the Ikhwan movement is dangerousdangerous and must be checked; and proposes as an alternative decision that Ibn Saud should be infonned that his subsidy, continued to him after the armistice to facilitate demobilisation, would no* be discontinued and that he should be pressed to do his utmost to check the further spread of the Ikhwan movement. 7. He anticipates that Ibn Saud will beg for a continuance of his subsidy on a reduced scale and suggests that His Majesty^ Government would be prepared to make a concession in this direction 'on certain stipulations'. He does not specify what those stipulations would be but it is clear that he contemplates that they should involve the complete surender of Ibn Saud on the Khurma question. He thinks that this alternative is more likely to achieve the results desired by His Majesty’s Government than the decision already arrived at. 8. With all due deference to Wilson I cannot take the financial grounds adduced by him at all seriously. I cannot believe that £60,000 per annum is a matter which will weigh strongly with His Majesty’s Government in the presence of strong political arguments for retaining a lien on the affections of Ibn Saud. A monthly subsidy is in present circumstances the only method open to us of keeping some sort of hold on Ibn Saud and provides us with a ready weapon to use in the event of his becoming really refractory. Its discontin uance will give him fL good grounds for denouncing the treaty of 1916 by which we have acquired a prvileged position in Central Arabia and will inevitably lead, if thethe French get a mandate for Damascus - an important if not the most important focus of Central Arabian commerce - to the development of political relations between them and Central Arabia. If therefore we wish to retain our exceptional position at tbe court of Riyadh we must be prepared to pay for it and £60,000 seems to me by no means a heavy prieefco pay. 9. As for consultation it will readily appear tnat the alternative now proposed by Wilson was as a matter of fact specifically considered and rejected after full consideration by the Conference. Wilson’s proposal is in all essentials the same as Hogarth’s and if anything slightly more brutal. Both involve the assumption that Ibn Baud is in the wrong on the Khurma question and must give way, while from such a view Lord Curzon and the Conference strongly dissented, 4he argument that Wilson was not consulted seems therefore to be a little weak. 10. Finally with regard to the third argument adduced I cannot say more than thai I think it would be extremely illadvised on our part to couple any communication on the subject of his subsidy with a warning to Ibn Baud to desist from Ikhwan activity. On such a matter he will and must decline to be advised or dictated to by us. Once he sees that our decision of the dispute is adverse to himself he will recognise that he must depend on himself alone for the establishment of his position. He has made a fair offer to abide by the finding of an impartial British boundary commission; the Sharif has declined to follow suit. We recognise the^fact© dispute but for adequate political reasons are not in a position to bring pressure on the SharifSharif to accejj eminently fair. ^t &lt; ^QiUuion which to our minds ig 11. In these circumstances the inly possible decision seems to iieto be the one already arrived at namely to let them settle the dispute in their own way and to protect the Hijaz if and when threatened by the Wahhabis. The threats of Wahhabi aggression of which we have heard so rxwch for many months have ne materialised and in ray opinion are not likely to until the Sharif assumes the offensive. Our efforts should be aimed at preventing that rather than at threatening Ibn Saud. 12. Meanwhile we should look farther south than Khurma. The Sharif doubtless wants Asir where the lari si is in much the same position as Ibn Saud, Kenya, Bisha and Tathlith are all. on the debatable border land. Ibn Saud is not neglecting those places and at any moment a storm may rise in the south which will be a very serious thing to cope with. What would be the Sharif’s position in the event of a combination against him by Jim Rashid, Ibn Saud and the Idrisi? The Sharif will have followers go long as he can pay them; his opponents will have a following so long as their religious liberty and territorial integrity are threatened and so long as there is a fair prospect of loot. The prospects of the last are more favourable in Mecca than at Khurma and other places. 13 . A Boundary Commission would dispose of this danger once and for all and I would urge that, His Majesty’s Grovernment’s decision being adhered to, the l^yptian authorities should be urged to do their utmost to persuade the Sharif to agree to the despatch of a Commission.

The King who fears defection of au. Aueibah has hurriedly returned to Mecca. He states that eight Wahabi missionaries have gone into Asir where he fears defection of his best levies especially his household Bishah troops. He declares that £12000 monthly goes on his military defence ^.oainuu Aklrvan and until tnelr menace is removed he will pretest against any reduction of his subsidy, must abdicate if Bin Baud is not forced to recall Ten Bijad, evacuate Khurma and stop Akhwan's aggression.

Your telegram No. 11604, dated 27th December, and connected correspondence. Bin Sand. His Majesty’s ‘Government have had whole question under further careful consideration in light of recent developments, and particularly of surrender of Medina, news of which has just been received. Their conclusion is that in altered circumstances nothing is to be gained for the present by further intervention in dispute between King Hussein and Bin Sand. Instructions as to ultimatum to latter are accordingly cancelled and no action need be taken on my telegrams of 13th and 24th December. Should it appear at any time that Mecca or other districts of Hejaz proper are seriously threatened by Bin Sand or his followers, whole position will have to be reconsidered. His Majesty’s Government would feel bound in that event to take such steps as might be practicable to secure maintenance of status quo. (12,975). Wt. P448—38. 3000. 12/17. S.J.F.&amp;Co.SECRET. / Arabia : r J lie Nejcl-Hejaz Feud. (Note by Political Department, India Office.) b The controversy between King Husain and Bin Sand, Emir of Eejd, 'which has formed the subject of numerous papers laid before the Eastern Committee, has now icached a ciitical stage. The immediate bone of contention between them is the village of Khurma, to which both parties lay claim. The village is actually On the hands of the Ikhwan,” Bin Sand’s Wahabi followers, whom the local Hejaz forces have made various unsuccessful attempts to dislodge! As has often been explained, the enmity between the two chieftains is deep-seated ; it reflects many years of rivalry between Mecca and Riadh, aggravated by personal jealousy and by the sectarian feud between Sunni and Wahabi. Political relations with Bin Sand have hitherto fallen within the sphere of Mesopotamia and the Government of India, while those with King Husain have been conducted from Cairo. It is unfortunate that the controversy between the two Chiefs has been to some extent reflected in the views of the two administrations with which they have, respectively, been brought into contact. At the present moment Bin Sand’s claims are championed by Colonel Wilson and Mr. Philby, while those, of King Husain have the support of Sir R. Wingate and Colonel Laurence. It was decided in September last to change the local atmosphere by sending an officer from the Egyptian side to Bin Sand ; but the decision has not yet been carried out. 2. As regards the rights and wrongs of the Khurma dispute, the following summary of a statement made by Sherif Eeisal, King Husain’s son, during a recent visit to the India Office (27th December 1918), gives the Hejaz side of the case :—- The Sherif discussed the relations between Bin Sand, Emir of Nejd, and the Hej az authorities. He explained the nature of the Wahabi movement, of which Bin Sand is the figure-head and the leading spirit. From the point of view r of doctrine, he has no objection whatever to Wahabism. But it is essentially a militant creed, and is being made to serve political ends. The Wahabis are intolerant of anybody and everything outside their own sect. If, for example, they gained possession of the Holy Places, they would exclude all non-Wahabis from the pilgrimage. So long as Wahabism v r as confined to Nejd, no one in the Hejaz had any desire to interfere with it. But they cannot tolerate fits appearance in the settled area west of the desert. That is the significance of the Khurma incident. Khurma is the first settled village west of the desert, and so long as it remains under the influence of Bin Sand, it forms an outpost of Wahabism in the settled area. Sherif Feisal is determined to expel the “ Ikhwan ” (i.e., the militant Wahabis) from the village. He-proposes to do so in the immediate future by force of arms. He will direct the campaign in person, and anticipates no difficulty in achieving his object. The matter is a small one, and need not, occasion His Majesty’s Government any pre-occupation. He will be quite satisfied with driving the Wahabis back into the desert, and has no intention of carrying the campaign into Bin Sand’s own country. There is one alternative, viz., that the Hejaz people should themselves embrace Wahabism. Eeisal is quite prepared to take this course, if the British Government wish; but it vmuld mean closing down the pilgrimage to all non-Wahabis for the future. 3. For Bin Sand’s claims to the village the following extract may be quoted from a report written by Mr. Philby in*August I91S 1 I venture to think that His Majesty’s Government will revise opinion based on distance of Khurma from Taif. As already pointed out, Khurma is only 10 miles east of unquestionable boundary of Buqum and Subai tribes, namely, Shaib Shaba. Question at issue, therefore, is jurisdiction over western section of Subai tribe, whose capital is Khurma, and whose boundary is Wadi Naim, 120 miles east of Khurma. Adjudication of Khurma' to Sherif, therefore, necessarily implies extending hpundaiy oi detailed statement of the claim, please see Appendix I. A 10 S 1C 40 1/199 Tleiciz to £i line about 200 miles or moie east of Taif. I Ins brings up question of Ataiba highlands extending another 100 miles east of Wadi Naim • and as Sherif claims jurisdiction over Ataiba, the boundary of Nejd falls back very nearly to the line Tuwaiq. I earnestly represent (1) that matter is far more complicated than is supposed, and has two sides; (2) that Bin Sand cannot abandon Khurma to its fate without raising widespread ^ disturbance of Nejd tribes . . . . ; and (3) that Khurma will never submit to Sherifian attacks. ’’--[Transmitted in Baghdad telegram No. 7418, dated 7th September 1918.] 4. Recent developments at Khurma may be briefly summarised. On the 26th November last Sir R. Wingate telegraphed that “ reports of aggressive intentions ” on the part pi Bin Sand were reviving in the Hejaz; and that, according to the local Sherifial military authorities, the “ Ikhwan ” at Khurma had been reinforced by 450 mounted men. A few days later (Oairo telegram No. 1827, 6th December) King Husain reported that the Ikhwan had attacked and looted the main supply base of the Hejaz force at Digadiah, about 45 miles north of Taif. The King urged that this aggression, so close to his capital, would “precipitate a crisis,” amAhat the situation could only be saved by an ultimatum from His Majesty’s Government requiring all Ikhwan concentrations to disperse within 35 days. In a subsequent report (Cairo telegram No. 1857, 10th December) King Husain stated that an Ikhwan force under Sultan Bin Bijad, said to be Bin Sand’s principal agent with the militant Wahabis, was “advancing towards Mecca.” Commenting on this news, Sir R. Wingate remarked that there was “ no longer a doubt, after the Digadiah “ affair, that the Ikhwan at Khurma have assumed the offensive, and constitute a “ menace to the security of Mecca.” He recommended the “ immediate despatch by “ His Majesty’s Government of peremptory instructions to Bin Sand to withdraw ail “ militant Ikhwan from neighbourhood, making it clear to him that failure or delay “ in compliance will entail reprisals (suspension of subsidy or closing of markets) “ by His Majesty’s Government.” Later reports (Cairo telegram No. 1881, 14th December) indicate an advance by the Wahabis to a point within 20 miles of Tail During the last three weeks no further news of hostilities has been received. Action on the Hejaz side appears to have been delayed in consequence of the non surrender of Medina by the Turks. 5. His Majesty’s Government decided on the 13th December “to warn Bin Sand “ plainly that if he does not at once abandon and cause his followers to abandon all “ aggressive action against Hejaz, and withdraw all militant Ikhwan now west of “ Khurma, his subsidy will be stopped and we shall consider ourselves free to take “ such further measures as we may deem desirable for maintenance of peace in “ Central Asia.” It was suggested that this message might make more impression if personally delivered by Colonel Wilson from Jeddah ; but the suggestion did not commend itself to Sir R. Wingate and was accordingly dropped. Instructions to forward the message from the Mesopotamian side were telegraphed to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, on the 24th December. The latter replied on the 27th December, proposing to send the message by the hand of Captain Bray, Political Agent at Bahrein, but asking to be furnished, as material for the proposed ultimatum, with “ somewhat more recent and, if possible, more reliable information than ex parte “ allegations by King Husain, the veracity of whose previous reports as to Bin Sand “ is not such as to inspire confidence.” It is not known whether Sir R. Wingate has taken any steps to supply the further particulars desired. The Egyptian authorities are inclined to regard the proposed message (which merely requires the withdrawal of Ikhwan west of Khurma^as not going far enough; and Colonel Wilson (of Jeddah) has expressed the view, which is shared by King Husain, that a “ conflagration ” is unavoidable “ unless Ikhwan are withdrawn from Khurma and Bin Sand’s occupation of that place through his Ikhwan ended ” (Cairo telegram No. 1927, 23rd December). Mr. Philby, on the other hand, has urged that His Majesty’s Government should intervene “ to prohibit Sherif from further aggression,” or should definitely recognise Bin Sand’s “suzerainty over Khurma” (Baghdad telegram No. 10483, 29th November). 6. On one point both Colonel Wilson and Mr. Philby are agreed, viz., that, failino- intervention by His Majesty’s Government, an armed conflict is inevitable. The question arises, if this view is accepted, whether we are bound to intervene, or ' *rmr-szr. o o whether events can be left to take their own course. Primct facie we are not concerned with the internal feuds of Central Arabia, or with the sectarian contro versies of Islam. Idle fact that both disputants are in close relations with ourselves is not necessarily a decisive factor, for we are under no obligation to either party to maintain his interests against Arab rivals. It is true that we could not tolerate a ^ Wahabi occupation of Mecca, which not only would be fatal to our prestige throughout the East, but would lead to endless difficulties over the pilgrimage question. But the War Office are already considering the question of rendering assistance to King Husain for the defence of his capital. Their proposals include, not only the despatch of Muhammadan troops, which seems clearly undesirable and is under stood to have been dropped, but the more practicable suggestion of supplying arms and war materiel. Moreover, so far as Mecca and the Ilejaz generally are concerned, the case is sufficiently covered by the terms of the ultimatum which His Majesty’s Government have already approved. The real question seems to be whether the time has come to insist on a settlement that will definitely assign Khurma to one party or the other, or' whether v e should leave the disputants to light it out among themselves, putting our trust in (1) our warning to Bin Sand against aggressive action west of Khurma, and (^2) Feisal’s undertaking to content himself with expelling the Ikhwan from the Khurma region, as guarantees for the localisation of the struggle. Against an immediate settlement it may be argued that the advice of our local officers is so conflicting as to make it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to form an equitable judgment on the merits of the case. Sir B. Wingate warns us that King Husain would probably abdicate sooner than accept even provisionally the assignment of Khurma to Bin Saud ; and Feisal has made it quite plain to us that he will not tolerate Wahabi occupation of the district. On the other hand, if Mr. Philby’s reports are accurate, the inhabitants of Khurma have adopted Wahabi tenets and espoused Bin Sand’s cause of their own free will; and their forcible reconversion or expulsion would be unpleasantly suggestive of religious persecution. The objections to letting matters drift are obvious. Our policy is to promote peace and goodwill, and not active hostilities, between our Arab friends. The spectacle of civil war between our two leading proteges will not redound to our credit or strengthen our claims to a “ mandate ” from the Peace Conference for the supervision of Arabian affairs. There is always the risk that the guarantees mentioned above will prove insufficient to localise the struggle, and that either the Hejaz party may advance into regions of which we are pledged by treaty to recognise Bin Saud as “ independent ruler” (Colonel Laurence, I understand, regards this as very improbable, and indeed as impracticable), 01 that Bin Saud, if successful at Khurma, may push his offensive into the Hejaz, where, for reasons indicated above, his presence would be intolerable. It has to be borne in mmd that active military intervention in the Hejaz or Central Arabia is not a practicable proposition; for practical purposes, our means of exerting pressure, it diplomatic methods fail, is by withholding our subsidy from the recalcitrant party and furnishing his rival with assistance in the form of supplies, munitions of war, and so forth. 7. The question is one that calls for an early decision by His Majesty s Govern ment. On the whole the Department is disposed to recommend— ^ (J) that the ultimatum already approved (see paragraph 5) should lie conveyed to Bin Saud by the hand of Captain Brayl wdthout more ado ; (2) that the evacuation of Khurma itself by Bin Sand’s followers should not be insisted upon; /o\ that Kins Husain should not be asked to accept a provisional frontier (as W sno-o-ested in Cairo telegram No. 1958, 27th December) definitely assuming Khurma to Bin Sand’s sphere; it would seem sufficient to communicate to him the substance of the ultimatum to Bin Saud and to ■ point out to him that the elimination of the Ikhwan from all regions west of Khurma will secure the Hejaz completely against further aggressive action He might be assured that we have no intention of prejudging the question of the status of the district, and merely ask him to exercise patience a little longer until the times are more propitious lor a final settlement. WTTkT E. Bray, M.U„ is an officer of the Indian Army, but he was formerly on special duty in the Heinz and is known to the authorities in Egypt. S 16 A24 r The action proposed is no doubt in the nature of a compromise, and does not go to the root of the difficulty, for which a solution will sooner or later W to be found. But it will gain time, and should stave off the immediate danger of a Wahabi advance upon Mecca It is difficult to believe that Bin Sand will not realise he necessity, in the present situation in Arabia, of keeping his hot-heads under control It should be borne in mind that, even if we do not succeed m averting a conflict, the consequences may not be so formidable as is sometimes apprehended. 1 ast experience of mter- Arab warfare tends to show that the results are not always very striking or decisive. The prolonged hostilities between Bin Sand and Bin Rashid are a case m point, tie Hejaz operations round Khurma are another. Even when Feisal returns to Arabia and puts himself at the head of the trained levies which he led against the lurks, it is very doubtful whether (apart from his undertaking to the India Office, see paragraphs 2 and 6) he can do more than clear the Khurma district ol the Ikhwan ; and if he stops at that there seems no reason why His Majesty's Government should not accept the fait accompli. In the last resort we are powerless to pievent it. $ India Office, 7th January 1919. J. E. S.APPENDIX I. Bix Saijd’s Claim to Kiiurma. (Extract from Memorandum by Mr. Phiibj, dated 13th August 1018.) Ibn Sand most undoubtedly claims Khurma as being within his jurisdiction—he does so not only on leligious and territorial grounds but also on historical, admini strative and tribal grounds. He therefore considers the Sheriff’s action as aggressive and hostile to himself. As I have said before, this is the chief disputed poinfbetween the two paities, ano Ibn Sand has again and again asserted his willingness that the British Government should adjudicate on the dispute on its merits. °It may be as well to be a little more precise regarding the grounds of Ibn Sand’s claim. [a) Religious. The whole population of Khurma, Ashraf and Subai, Bada and Hadhr are of the Wahhabi persuasion, and, moreover, have joined the inner brother hood of that sect, namely, the Akhwan. As such they regard all non-Wahhabis as Mushrikin (heretics) and Kaffar (infidels), and look up. to Ibn Saud as their Imam and temporal ruler. As far as I can ascertain they have been Wahhabis (or Haubalis) from all time—they have become Akhwan largely in self defence against the Sheriff’s aggression dating from some years back, and particularly since the Sheriff tried last year to impose a Qadhi on them with a view to breaking up their Wahhabi tendencies. As Wahhabis and Akhwan they have a religious claim on the protection of the people of Najd and Ibn Saud. _ (b) Territorial. —High Commissioner points out that Khurma is only 80 miles in a direct line from Tail That may be true, but scarcely proves that Khurma is in the Hedjaz. I believe I am the only European who has ever seen Khurma and the country round it; I speak, therefore, with a full sense of my responsibility, and my considered view is that the boundary of the Hedjaz, in the wddest sense in which that term is capable of being used, runs (in the tract under consideration) along the eastern edge of the Shaib Shaba south-westward to Turaba. This is undoubtedly the recognised boundary between the Buqum and Subai tribes, and a reference to my route chart will show that it comes up to within 10 miles of Khurma. This is my opinion, while Ibn Saud and others with whom 1 have had opportunities'of discussing the matter carry the boundary back 50 miles westward to the Wadi Aqiq. I believe this latter boundary can be established by Turkish documentary evidence, as the line of the Aqiq was agreed upon in the seventies between the Turkish authorities and Ibn Rashid as being the natural boundary between the Hedjaz-and Najd. However, I should feel inclined to disregard this evidence as the Buqum and Shalassa are, to my view, undoubtedly Hedjaz tribes. In my opinion, therefore, the Shaib Shaba is the only possible natural boundary, and, if this view is accepted, Khurma (though only 10 miles from the Hedjaz boundary) lies in Najd. (c) Tribal. —The Khurma tract is peopled wholly by the Subai tribe, which is essentially a tribe of Najd, and extends through its whole breadth from the Summan to Wadi Subai. In view of this Ibn Saud claims jurisdiction over the Subai of Khurma, but is prepared to renounce his claim if the Subai themselves express a preference for Sheriffian rule ; he is not, however, prepared to abandon them to the tender mercies of the Sheriff so long as they claim his protection and acknowledge his rule. (d) Historical and Administrative. —These grounds may be considered together. High Commissioner is informed that Khalid was nominated Amir of Khurma four years ago by the Sheriff. This is improbable on the face of it, as Khalid, according to my information, succeeded his cousin Ghalib on the latter’s death in the ordinary course of inheritance, and, like other Amirs of Najd, has regularly made his annual visit to Riyadh to receive his subsidy and presents ever since as his predecessor did before him. In any case if any formal appointment by the Sheriff took place, and was acknowledged by Khalid himself, he ought to be in a position to produce documentary evidence. What he in all probability means (turning the circumstance to suit his own present requirements) is that when Ghalib died his successor, Khalid, was formally recorded in the Turkish registers as the rightful recipient of the Haj Surra paid by the Turkish Government to all tribes in a position to annoy the annual pilgrim caravans. That is a very different matter, and proves nothing, as the pages6 of Doughty are s^cienuo^how ^rouhliome!'' On't^S hand goi^rther back, there is very little doubt that Klnmna was under the effective jurisdiction of the Saud dynasty m the days of its early greatness, and Ibn gaud claims that the long-standing exemption from taxation, which the People of Khurma have enjoyed, and still enjoy, was conferred upon them by c-aud the hirst# (or possibly Sand the Great, he., Sand the Second i.he real founder of the W ahhabi Vninirel. It is fairly certain that neither the Sheriff nor the Turks have ever collected •1 mite by way of taxation from the people of Khurma a fact ''hieh goes fai to prove their claim to independence. If that is admitted the people of Khurma cannot well be blamed if they choose to place themselves under the suzerainty of a power 111 which they have confidence, and to which they are attached by religious, geographical, racial and other ties, and to resist any claim to overlordship by a ruler who has made it clear that he will not tolerate the exercise of their religions according to their own lights. The above remarks, I trust, will be sufficient to show that at any rate there is a good case for investigation and that no cx parte opinion can dispose of it satisfactorily. The two reverses to his ailns which I have reported hare doubtless proved injurious to the Sheriff’s prestige, but he has no one to blame for that but himself. I note that the High Commissioner considers that the Sheriff regards Khurma as his territory u apparently with reason,” and that he does not doubt the sincerity of his assuiances that Shakir will not advance east of Khurma to attack Ibn Saud s subjects. If these icmdrks are intended to indicate that no action is being or has been taken to prevent the development of the Sheriff’s operations and that His Majesty’s Govern ment approve of thus letting events run their course, I can only say I regard the situation with the most lively apprehension. Until the worst comes to the worst, however, I cannot believe that His Majesty’s Government, after their impartial warning to both rulers to refrain from provocative action, will allow one of the recipients of that warning to disregard it in the very matter m respect of which it was issued. The issue of that warning has, as already reported, had a very favour able effect on Ibn Saud, but he assumes, as I think he is entitled to do, that it will be equally effective on the Sheriff. Finally, a word as to the “ activities of Akhwan agents who are evidently at the root of the trouble.” To the best of my belief the somewhat vague and often reiterated accusation that Akhwan agents have of late been busy undermining the influence of the Sheriff has never been substantiated. In any case it is scarcely applicable to the case of Khurma, whose inhabitants, lock, stock, and barrel, have always been Wahhabis and are all Akhwan and as such require no proselytising. The abortive mission of the Sheriffian Qadhi on the other hand is clear enough evidence that it is the Sheriff who is guilty of interfering with the religious liberty of the people of Khuripa. This is no mere vague accusation based on Wahhabi reports, but is fully borne out by the evidence of the letters of the King’s son, Abdulla, of which I have already forwarded translations. Incidentally I may mention that present Wahhabi priest of Khurma and bis father before him have occupied the post without a break for 60 years, the father having been appointed by* Faisal. APPENDIX II. Laurer assigning ,Ihe alleged Treaty between Bin Saud and the Siierif.

The position appears to be that in the a eai 1910 Hie Sherif, taking advantage of a revolt in Southern Nejd, sent his son Abdullah to invade Qasim. I he invasion was not completely successful, but Bin Saud was loiced to accept the Sherif s terms, which included the stipulation that the gieat tribes lying between Nejd and the Hejaz should be outside Bin Sand’s sphere. In 1915 Abdullah again led an expedition to enforce the terms of the 1910 treaty, but peace was patched up and Abdullah retired.[This Document is the P roperty of Hi« Britannic Majesty^ Government, and should b« retu rned to the Foreign Office if not required for official uae.j 'ilia 'Soesfitw'; llrDla camoj^ b^pnicai^f ^ filial' 1,D gtoleir t . ty/atetierejjj 'fitsatitoA Proved injiirii ie W- Iflotefe asiisterriie; liis assiirme Ejects.

I have deemed it convenient to abandon any attempt at a chronological narrative of the Mission s work in favour of a full and separate discussion of the various problems which have called for consideration during the period under report. Furthermore considerations of space have deterred me from including m this review any detailed account of mv journeyings in Arabia or ot the geographical and other incidental results obtained in the course thereof except m so far as may be necessary to elucidate the matters with which the Mission was more directly concerned. I have already contributed brief accounts ot some of my journeys for publication in the Arab Bulletin, and I look iorward now to a period of leisure wherein to sort out and arrange in a form suitable for publication the copious notes which I have collected on a 'variety ot interesting subjects during my long sojourn in Arabia. . 2. Previous Relations between Britain and Najd. P/j, 01 * to the outbreak of the Great War there had for obvious reasons been but little official intercourse between the British authorities and the rulers of JNajd. Apart from the fanatical inhospitality and aloofness of the people themselves the long-standing friendship of Britain and Turkey precluded anv- thmg like political recognition by the former of the latter’s rebellious and independent dependency. Indeed the first occasion on which a British Officer visited Najd in an 0 cia capacity v as when 99 years ago Lt. Sadlier, deputed for the purpose •i . Jx udian Government, traversed the devastated territories of the Wah abi Fmpire with the sole object of conveying to the destroyer the congratula- 10 ns o overnment on his handiwork and of urging him to take drastic pre- ■ cautions against a revival of the Wahhabi power. Fortunately Ibrahim Pasha an 086 or whom he acted were not men to take good advice, and if the purpose ot Ft. badiier s mission ever became known in Arabia it had certainly been forgotten before the next British Mission visited Riyadh. That was in 1865 when Colonel Lewis Pelly, who, as Political Resident in tbe i ersian Gulf, had been called upon to deal with matters arising out of tiie piracy and slave trade still practised on the Arabian shore of the Persian Guit decided on his own initiative to visit the Wahhabi Monarch with a small informed Mission. His reception by Fasal ibn Saud and his Wazir was not encouraging; and the British Mission returned to the coast being conscious ia , t lough much had been learned, little had been accomplished in the direc tion of establishing permanent friendly relations with the Wahhabi Court. There ensued a long break in official intercourse between Britain and 1 Av ’ w i Se ^tunes during the interval were rudely shaken by the aggression of the newly risen Rashid dynasty at Hail. Riyadh and all its provinces were occupied by Muhammad ibn Rashid and the Saud family sought refuge at p 'nu lW j lt x^ 11 G e -»r e Y^ ere 011 ^ ie coast where they remained in exile until 1902. ibe death of Muhammad ibn Rashid in 1898 and the recovery of Riyadh and its provinces four years later by their present ruler were followed by a period of consolidation during which the ambitions of Ibn Saud in the direction of asa and the difficulties in which he became involved with the Turks disposed nm to look with friendly eyes on the power which he had learned to know as the protector of Kuwait, and Captain W. H. C. Shakespear, I.A., Political2 Agent at Kuwait, had little difficulty in establishing “^fXiLting tions with the ruler of Najd by a series of to Suez in the early The history of his operations and the sequel thereto ha , li , t&lt; Precis re- ^ati^ S y Shm a spt n A th d:afh eat Hrn:^^^ and held in high honour in Arabia by all with whom he came into contact, and I TV ma Q e ^ doubt that had he lived, Hail would have fallen long since and Ibn Sand, assisted by us on a more lavish scale than was m fashion during the early davs of the War, would have taken a more prominent part m operations against the enemy than it has been possible or indeed necessary for him to do. A reference to the Memorandum above quoted will show that the death of Captain Shakespear in January 1915, on the bat *. le ^ ^ Ibn Rashid the forces of Ibn Sand were arrayed m our cause a^mst those of Ibn Rashid who had declared for Turkey and where the day went lU a J iy, T T^ followed by a long period of military inactivity on the part of Ibn Sand. I interval hid, however, been profitably spent m cementing our alliance with him and had resulted in a treaty highly satisfactory to both parties m a meet ing of rulers at Kuwait at which Sir P. Cox invested Ibn baud with the insignia of a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire and finally m a visit by Ibn Saud to Basrah, during which he not only had every opportunity 11 of seeing for himself the paraphernalia of modern warfare and the results ot ' the British occupation of Basrah, but was himself provided with a welcome addition to his armament and a regular monthly subsidy to enable him to I ^^4-4-r-r/-v 4 -t c orroicf lii q o ti rl nnr pti omv. Ibn Raslud. The year 1917 thus dawned with bright hope for the future. The neces sity of sending an Officer to represent him in Najd was already engaging bir P Cox’ serious attention, but it was not until May, that an opportunity P 1 ®' sented itself of giving efiect to his plans in this direction. Mr. (now Colonel) E Storrs C.M.G., had arrived at Baghdad on a visit on behalf ot the High Commissioner for Egypt, and with the latter’s ready consent it was decided that he should return to Egypt across Arabia, visiting Ibn Saud m the Qasim en route in order to place Sir P. Cox in possession of such first hand informa tion regarding Ibn Sand’s strength and prospects as was necessary to enable him to decide on the course to be adopted with a view to making the operations in Central Arabia a substantial contribution to the general activities of our Military forces in the Turkish theatre of War. Incidentally Mr. Storrs was to endeavour to effect such improvement as was possible in the relations of : the King of the Hijaz and the Wahhabi ruler, whose mutual suspicions and dis trust were growing increasingly apparent. The necessary preliminary preparations having been made, Mr. Storrs left Kuwait on the 9th June, 191§, 7 with a zilfi caravan, but four days later he was back at Kuwait, having fallen a victim to the sun on the third day of his journey. It was out of the question for him to think of venturing again into the desert at such a season and he returned to Egypt by sea. It was now obviously impracticable to renew the attempt to link up with Ibn Saud until the climate moderated and the hot weather dragged on with Ibn Saud making a somewhat half-hearted pretence of threatening Hail from the Qasim until Ramdhan, when he left Turki, his eldest son, in command of such forces as had not dispersed and returned to Riyadh to^ fast. Meanwhile the position in Central Arabia was becoming increasingly obscure, Madina showed no signs of falling to the forces of the Sharif, the Turks held on to the Hijaz railway, repairing breaches therein as they occurred, while the rela tions of our two chief Arab allies, the Sharif and Ibn Saud, were rapidly becoming strained and difficult, the inactivity of the latter giving the former pretexts for accusing him of lukewarmness in our cause and even of tacit neutrality of a benevolent nature towards Ibn Rashid and the Turks. It was in these circumstances that at the end of September, 1917, Sir P. Cox renewed the project of sending a mission to Ibn Saud and, as it was generally agreed that a serious effort should be made to eliminate or neutralise Ibn Rnshid in order that the Sharif’s operations might be facilitated and the ground of the existing friction between him and Ibn Saud removed, His Majesty’s Government sanctioned the. despatch of a Mission of more ambitious pro portions than had been considered feasible during the previous hot weather. In fact it was contemplated that the Mission should be sufficiently representa tive of all interests to be able to dispose of the political differences and jea lousies of our various Arab allies and that it should at the same time partake of a semi-military character in order that such proposals as it might make3 . regarding the military assistance required by Ibn Sand should carrv dnA weight and that it might, m the event of action being decided upon and under taken, assume the role of adviser to the Wahhabi leaders. P ^ und er- The despatch of the Mission was sanctioned by His Majesty’s Government Ba^td g S d dt d lSe e , 2 ° th 0Ct ° ber ’ 1917 ’ and the &lt;3. Personnel of the Mission. , The Proposals originally made by Sir Percy Cos to His Majesty’s Govern ment contemplated a more ambitious and representative comnosition of the Mission than was eventually realised. It was hoped that the High Commis sioner for Egypt and His Highness the King of the Hijaz would be able t^send cXneTR^E^A 0 HnmH^ 'VI ^ ell ^ r r!• 0n 1 S5 a 11 Was contemplated that Lt- Lolonei it. A. Hamilton, C.I.E., Political Agent at Kuwait who was at the time on his way into Kajd m another connection, would be able to serve on the Mission to represent the interests of Shaikh Salim of Kuwait- further rt was hoped that a Medical Officer would be available; and, finally, the object of the Mission being primarily of a military character, it was understood that a responsible military officer would be deputed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force to examine and report on the military situation m Central Arabia Finally it was held to be essential, in order to assist and expedite the work of the Mission, that a small Wireless Telegraph detachment should be attached to it if available. p This somewhat ambitious scheme of things was, as already noted, not realised Lt-Colonel F. Cunliffe Owen, C.M.G., K.F.A., was 7 deputed to represent the Gommander-in-Chief and accompanied me from Baghdad to itiyadh, where, during my somewhat prolonged absence at Jidda and Cairo he remained m charge of the Mission’s local work until February, 1918, when he returned to the coast and departed on short leave prior to resuming his militarv duties. Lt.-Colonel K. E. A. Hamilton, who was at Riyadh on the arrival ot the Mission, was kind enough to remain for several days to give me the benefit of his views and advice before returning to his work at Kuwait. With these two exceptions the personnel of the Najd Mission throughout tfie period under report comprised only myself. Looking back now over that period, I am inclined to think that the scale of personnel originally contemplated was too ambitious. Useful as a wireless installation would have been, the presence of a considerable number of British operators m this inhospitable and fanatical country would have been a con stant source of anxiety. A doctor would certainly have been a most valuable asset in assisting to allay the fanatical attitude of the people towards all imps foreign except food supplies, piece-goods, arms and medicine, and I recently suggested^ for your consideration the desirability of filling this un- ,i° u d ^. £? a P- . bhis question, though now of but academic interest so far as the Mission itseJ is concerned, should certainly be taken seriously into consideration in the event of a permanent political representative’being accredited to the Wahhabi court hereafterin view, however, of the fact that it was at one time contemplated that a medical representative of the American Mission m the Persian Gulf might be induced, to fill up the gap, to say nothing of a certain unmistakable tendency in the direction of the extension of Mis sionary activity in Arabia on the part of the Mission authorities, I deem it necessary to warn Government that a medical officer drawn from that source would not be acceptable to Ibn Saud and his subjects, and that every effort should be made to discourage medical practice in his territories by the person nel of the American Mission. It is due in fairness to Ibn Saud to explain that he extended a most cordial invitation to Dr. Harrison of that Mission to visit Riyadh for medical work in the summer of 1917, and that it was entirely his own fault that his work terminated abruptly. It can never be absolutely necessary to wrap up pills and powders in Christian tracts. Finally in view of the Shariff’s attitude towards Ibn Saud, I do not think that any good purpose would have been served by the deputation of a Sharifian en-voy to co-operate with the Mission, but no words can adequately express my i egret that circumstances deprived me of the collaboration of a representative of the High Commissioner for Egypt—and more particularly of that of Mr. (now Colonel) R. Storrs, UM.G., than whom no person could have been more acceptable to Ibn Saud in view^ of his projected visit to Najd earlier in the year as the representative of Sir Percy Cox. To this point I attach great importance, and it must be realised that, from Ibn Sand’s point of view, I went to Egypt as the advocate of his cause and came back defeated by the advocates of the Sharif. We should describe the position somewhat differently, but the result was the same to Ibn Saud and to us. 4. Objects of the Mission. Summing up the position as regards the affairs of Ibn Saud in his telegram ^•4035, dated the 23rd September, 1917, Sir P. Cox noted that it had been his “ hope that the projected Mission of Mr. Storrs in the previous June and his passage to the Sharif accompanied by an envoy from Ibn Saud would have4 the effect both of dispelling the atmosphere of distrust prevailing m Shanfian circles and of enabling us to decide if there were any means by which we could make Ibn Saud more actively useful. At the end of the same telegram, while expressing his view that, if more^ military use were to be made of Ibn Saud, ‘‘we must really approach the subiect seriously and lend him an Indian or Egyptian battery, Sir E. Lm questioned the value of such an experiment unless it was desired by the Egyptian authorities, but suggested that m any case a mixed Mission repre senting the Commander-in-Chief, the High Commissioner and himself should visit Najd to “ make proposals in accordance with practical possibilities. In communicating' the news of the proposed Mission to the King of the Hiiaz the High Commissioner for Egypt “ purposely emphasised the military character of the Mission and its role of advising Ibn Saud regarding measures to be taken against the Turks and Ibn Rashid.” _ At the same time while noting the “ somewhat uncompromising state of mind ” of King Husain and deprecating any premature attempt to settle the larger political questions at issue between him and Ibn Saud he expressed the hope that time and the successful completion of the Mission, resulting, it is hoped, in active aggres sion against the enemy on the part of Ibn Saud, would prove to the King the folly of his present policy of suspicion and the wisdom of effecting a reconcilia tion with his nearest powerful neighbour.” Finally, following upon exhaustive verbal discussions of the Arabian situation in relation to the proposed work of the Mission, Sir P. Cox summed up his instructions to me in a written memorandum, dated the 31st October, 1917, the gist of which is briefly as follows, namely: — 1. “ The primary and principal object ” of the Mission is to discuss fully with Ibn Saud and form an opinion as to whether any, and, if so, what further action Ibn Saud can usefully take to further the common cause against the enemy; 2. “To endeavour to clear the atmosphere pervading Ibn Sand’s relations w T ith the Sharif and the Shaikh of Kuwait ” ; 3. “‘To find a permanent or temporary solution of the Ajman question ” ; 4. “ To discuss with Ibn Saud his recent application for permission to issue a copper coinage for Najd ” ; and 5. “To discuss the question of the permanent appointment of a British Political Agent for Najd. In addition to the above matters Sir P. Cox asked me to discuss such matters as the restriction of trade owing to the exigencies of the war; the impossibility of granting shipping facilities for the Hasa ports during the war; and the restriction of pilgrim traffic. Such were the letter and spirit of the instructions under which the Mis sion sailed to its task. For my part I never lost sight of the fact that its primary and principal object was to further the common cause against the enemy by successful action against Ibn Rashid. 5. Itinerary of the Mission. Leaving Baghdad on the afternoon of the 29th October, 1917, the Mission proceeded by launch to Basrah, where it arrived at midnight of the 2nd Novem ber, 1917. Eight days were spent at Basrah collecting supplies and equip ment, and during this period I took advantage of the presence at Zubair of a number of chiefs of the neighbouring desert tribes to make myself acquainted with their affairs in a series of personal interviews with them. By the morning of the 11th November, all was ready for a start and the Mission embarked on H.M.S. Lawrence, which had been placed at its disposal by the courtesy of Rear Admiral C. St. Wake, C.B., commanding the Naval Forces in the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia. On the 13th November, we arrived at Bahrain, where we found that the Political Agent, Captain P. G. Loch, I.A., had kindly made arrangements for the further progress of the Mission to Uqair by dhow. At 9 a.m. on the following morning the Mission embarked on a dhow flying the flag of Ibn Saud and, Captain Crozier of H.M.S. Lawrence having very kindly placed his steam cutter at our disposal to tow us some part of the way as there was no wind, we made good progress to the mouth of the Straits of Bahrain. The journey from Bahrain to IJqair normally takes seven or eight hours by dhow but, after parting company with the steam cutter, we drifted becalm ed for the rest of that day and the next day’s sun was setting as we eventually drew alongside the pier at Uqair on the 15th November, 1917. From Uqair, where we were received on behalf of Ibn Saud by the local Amir, Abdul Rahman ibn Khairulla, we proceeded to Hasa, reaching Hufuf on the 19th November. Hospitably entertained here on behalf of Ibn Saud by Abdulla ibn Jiluwi, the Governor of Hasa, w^e left Hufuf on the 22nd ( fNovember, for the interior and arrived at Riyadh about mid-day on the 30th November. At Riyadh as already noted we were met by Lieut.-Colonel R. E. A. Hamilton, Political Agent at Kuwait, and most cordially received bv His Excellency, Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, and his father, the Imam Abdul Rahman ibn Eaisal. During the following days the Mission was very fully occupied in dis cussing with Ibn Saud the objects of its visit. In him I found an indefatig able worker and, in spite of a tendency to be carried away from the point of his argument by the waves of his Quradic eloquence, a man of good business capacity, moderately well versed in the affairs of the world, fully conversant with but by no means a disinterested spectator of the intricacies of Arab politics and above all genuinely convinced of the necessity of the British alliance as the only secure safeguard of the interests of his country and people both now and hereafter. By midnight of the 5th December having spent no less than 34 out of 132 hours since my arrival in interviews with Ibn Saud, to say nothing of sub sidiary interviews with his cousin Ahmad ibn Thunaiyan, who appeared to be in his full confidence and was often sent to prepare the way for delicate subjects likely to arise in the course of subsequent interviews,—I felt that I was sufficiently cognisant of the main facts of the situation to formulate definite proposals for the consideration of Government. In^ the meantime it w T as becoming increasingly evident that the King of the Hijaz was doing his utmost to thwart the consummation of the Mission’s work by obstructing the Mission of an envoy from the High Commissioner for Egypt to Najd. Ibn Saud and I were fully agreed that the presence of such an envoy to see the conditions of this country for himself was essential in the interests of all concerned, and, accordingly, when I received the news that the King had definitely refused a safe-conduct to Mr. Storrs on the ground that the roads from the Hijaz to Hail—perhaps he meant Buraida—were unsafe, I decided with Ibn Saud’s ready approval to secure a reconsideration of the verdict by proving that the alleged danger existed only in the imagination of the King. Accordingly on the 9th December, leaving Lieut.-Colonel Cunliffe Owen in charge of the current business of the Mission, and confident that no definite orders could be passed on my main proposals and communicated to Riyadh much before my return, I set out for Taif. Arriving at my destination late in the afternoon of Christmas Day, I was somewhat dismayed to find not only that Mr. Storrs was not there to meet me, but that no warning of my expected arrival had been communicated to the King. This was certainly extremely disconcerting. That the King assumed my unannounced arrival to be the result of a plot to break down his opposition to our negotiations with Ibn Saud I have no doubt whatever; whether he has since been persuaded that the unfortunate omission to inform him was a pure accident I do not know. I do not know myself whether it was an accident. However that may be, I was hospitably entertained by Sharif Humad, the acting Amir of Taif 3 until the 28th December, when in answer to a courteous invitation from the Sharif I set out for Jidda—taking however the precaution to leave half my caravan and all my heavy luggage behind at Taif. On the last day of the year I rode into Jidda, where Lieut.-Colonel Basset and the Officers of the British Military Mission very kindly accommodated and entertained me during the following fortnight. A few days later, Commander I). G. Hogarth, C.M.G., R.N.V.R., arrived at Jidda to preside a,s the special representative of the High Commissioner at certain conferences with the King which Colonel Basset was endeavouring to arrange. The King after leaving it long in doubt whether he would come down or not, eventually arrived at Jidda about two days after Commander Hogarth, and during the following days I was present at a series of conversations, in which the relations of Ibn Saud and the King were the main theme of discussion. Suffice it here to say that as soon as it became^ apparent that no useful purpose would be served by further discussion of this subject, in view of the King’s unrelenting atti tude of hostility, I decided, with the approval of Commander Hogarth and Colonel Basset, to take my leave of His Highness. Certain indications had already prepared me for what followed, namely, the point-blank refusal of King to allow me to return overland. Such pressure as Commander Hogarth and Colonel Basset were able to bring to bear on the King was exerted in vain and nothing remained but for me to return to my work by sea. M ith Sir P. Cox’ approval I availed myself of the High Commissioner’s kind invitation to visit Cairo en route and accordingly accompanied Com mander Hogarth on his return in H.M.S. Hardinge, which left Jidda on the 14th January, 1918, and visiting Yanba, Wajh and Aqaba on the way arrived at Suez on the 20th January. The same evening I arrived at Cairo where, with a brief interlude, during which I accompanied Commander Hogarth on a visit to Palestine and Jerusalem, I remained till6 the 16th February, discussing Arab affairs in relation to the work of the Mis sion with the High Commissioner and the Officers in charge of the Arab Bureau. On the 16th February, matters now being in a fair way towards final settlement, I left Cairo on my rteurn journey to Basrah via Suez, Karachi and Bombay and on the 24th March, 1918, arrived at my destination. By this time Sir P. Cox had departed on his way to Egypt and England ^ and I decided to remain at Basrah until the orders of His Majesty s G 0 ™™- ment on the final proposals made in his telegram, No. B-29, dated the 9th March, 1918, from Maskat, were received. On the 26th March, I received a telegram from you informing me that Sir P. Cox’ proposals had received the sanction of His Majesty’s Government, and I was thus free to return to Ibn Saud to communicate the result of my negotiations. My original plan was to return to Ibn Saud, who was then said to be in Hasa, via Kuwait, but the arrival of messengers from Dhari ibn Tawala, then residing at Hafar in accordance with my previous instructions, decided me to travel up the Batin to Dhari’s Camp and thence down to Ibn Saud. Accordingly on the 28th March, 1918, I travelled by rail to Zubair, and on the following morning struck into the interior. Arriving at Dhari’s camp near Hafar on the 2nd April I rested there the two following days discussing the affairs of the desert, and on the 5th April, accompanied by Dhari himself, I resumed my march southward to Ibn Saud. Arriving at Shaib Shauki on the Arma plateau on the 11th April, I found that Ibn Saud had arrived there the same day from Hasa. Here I accordingly remained till the 16th April discussing matters with Ibn Saud and then accompanied him to Riyadh which we reached on the 19th April. The result of my discussions with Ibn Saud had been an undertaking on his part to mobilize' for action against Ibn Rashid in the coming Ramdhan (June-July) and to spend the intervening period in laying in necessary provi sions and making other preparations for his operations. The prospect of sitting idle at Riyadh till the middle of July was far from attractive, and I was fortunate enough to obtain Ibn Saud’s somewhat half hearted consent to my spending at least some part of this interval in a tour to the southern limits of Najd. Accordingly on May 6th I set out from Riyadh via Hair, Kharj, Aflaj and Sulaiyyil to Wadi Dawasir, whence, travelling via the plateau of Tuwaiq and visiting Haddar, Hamar, Sitara, Ghail and Hauta, I returned to Riyadh on the 24th June after an absence of exactly 50 days. On the 5th August, 1918 (Ibn Saud’s eldest son, Turki, having already made an unsuccessful attempt to open the offensive against the Shammar) all {vas ready for the beginning of the main campaign, and I accompanied Ibn Saud from Riyadh, via Wadi Hanifa, Washm, Sirr, Mudhuib and Anaiza, to Buraida, where we arrived on the 25th August, 1918. Here some further delay ensued while the various contingents of Ibn Saud’s striking force collected, and it was not till the 9th September, 1918, that Ibn Saud himself, refusing for reasons to be explained later to allow me to accompany him, launched out against Hail. I spent the period of his absence at Anaiza and rejoined him at Qusaiba after his return from Hail on the 28th September, 1918. An immediate repetition of his attack on Hail not being practicable, we returned with the whole force of some 5,000 men to Tarafiya and thence to Buraida, where on the 4th October I received the somewhat disconcerting instructions of H. M.’s Government to close down operations, and in this connection decided to go down to the coast, which I reached at Kuwait, via Shamasiya, Zilfi, Dijani and Qaraa on the 16th October. In all I spent some nine months of the period under report actually on Arabian soil and during that time covered some 2,600 miles* in travel. The greater part of_ my journey from Riyadh to Taif and the wholef of my journey from Riyadh to Wadi Dawasir and back was through a country hither to, I believe, never visited by Europeans, while the circumstances of my travel enabled me, even in better known tracts such as Washm, Sirr and the Qasim itself, to visit villages lying off the beaten track of previous travellers. My map sketches have been in part compiled by Lieut.-Colonel C. Ryder, C.I.E., D.S.O., Director of Surveys, Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force. 6. Shaikhs of the Zubair Hinterland. On the arrival of the Mission at Basrah, where a short delay was necessary for the purpose of collecting stores and equipment, I found that invitations *According to my dead reckoning calculations which were for the most part at 3 miles per hour over good ground and 2^ to 2| miles per hour over rough or heavy going, tExcepting the District of Kharj which was visited by Lieut.-Colonel Cunliffe Owen in January, 1918, during my abs'ence from Riyadh.T iiad been issued to tbe friendly Shaikhs of tbe Zubair liinterland to attend a race-meeting, arranged to take place at Basrali, during the first week of November. The occasion seemed suitable for discussing with them the affairs of the nearer desert and its tribes as a preliminary to such operations as the Mission might be called upon to undertake in the interior, more especially as for some time past correspondence between Basrah and Baghdad had indicated the necessity of taking stock of the merits of the various professedly friendly leaders of the Shammar and Bhafir who had long enjoyed our bounty and made no adequate return in the direction of action against our common enemies. The Chief of the Shaikhs m cjuestion was Saud ibn Salih al Subhan, who, .some twelve months previously, had deserted Ibn Rashid and come in to us’ being cordially welcomed as an ally and provided with a substantial subsidy of Rs. 0,01)0 per mensem, together with arms, ammunition and supplies in the hope that he would prove actively useful in cutting off caravans bound for iiail and other enemy destinations. For some time it had been whispered that he was playing us false and it was beyond question that he had so far done nothing to deserve his subsidy, which wns reduced to Rs. 3,000 n m shortly before the Mission left Baghdad. S a lib in order of importance stood Dhari ibn Tawala of the Aslam Shammar, whose subsidy was Rs. 1,000 p.m. He had rapidly been displacing Saud in the estimation of those Officers, who had dealings with the desert, and it had only recently been reported that his g’enerosity towards his. followers had resulted in his having at his call a far larger and more reliable following than his rival. The third of the trio of local Shaikhs was Hamud ibn Suwait of the Dhafir, who was also in receipt of a Government allowance and to whom was assigned the task of watching the Basrah-Nasiriyah railway from the desert side and of preventing egress therefrom by smugglers and access thereto by enemies. On the 5th November, I accompanied a party organised by Mr. (now Lt.- Col.) E. B. Howell, C.I.E., Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah, to Zubair where we were entertained by Shaikh Ibrahim and I was introduced to Dhari ion 1 awala, Hamud ibn Suwait and Muhammad ibn Subhan, the younger brother of Saud al Salih, who, perhaps conscious of his past shortcomings, had sent to excuse himself from personal attendance at the races on the score of illness. With these Shaikhs I had some preliminary conversation on topics of mutual interest and arranged that they should come in to Basrah for a more prolonged discussion some day in the near future; at the same time I begged Muhammad to send a special messenger to his brother to impress upon°him the advisability of his appearing in person. On November Tth, Dhari Hamud and Muhammad arrived at Basrah in company with Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair and I had prolonged interviews with each of them in turn except Muhammad, whom I informed that I would reserve all discussion of his brother’s affairs until he appeared in person. As a matter of fact Saud al Salih never appeared. Shaikh Ibrahim was most useful to me in discussing confidentially the merits of the various personalities I had to deal with. He was enthusiastic as regards Dhari and the prospects of his being usefully employed to further the interests of the British Government ; he was no less adverse to Saud al Salih, whom he described as an imposter with no desire to serve anyone honestly but himself, while as regards Hamud he maintained an attitude of indifference, the present head of the Dhafir being personally insignificant and an indifferent successor to a line of Chiefs, who had made the name of Ibn Suwait respected and feared in the past. After full and free discussion with Ibrahim, Dhari and Hamud and in consultation with Mr. Howell, I came to the following conclusions, namely: — (1) that Saud al Salih was unlikely to be of any practical service to us and that the allowance, which we were wasting on him, should be discontinued or reduced to a small personal allowance payable on the condition of his residence at some place in the sphere of our effective control; (2) that the Dhafir, being fixed by immemorial tradition to the desert tract now traversed by the railway, Hamud ibn Suwait and his tribesmen would be most profitably employed in their home range and could not with advantage be brought into any operations in the interior; and (3) that Dhari, of whom on my short acquaintance with him I had formed a high opinion, might profitably be employed in connection with the activities of the Najd Mission. I accordingly telegraphed on November 8th, in the sense of the above conclusion proposing: — (1) that Sand’s allowance should be reduced to Rs. 500 per mensem, the arms formerly given to him be withdrawn and he himself directed to reside at Zubair, Basrah or Muhammara ;(2) tliat Hamud should be left undisturbed at the task on which he was-. then employed; and , -n q non (3) that Dhari’s allowance should be increased from Es ;l’ 0 J? ^ p.m. and that his services henceforth should be placed at the disposal of the Kajd Mission—the rifles withdrawn from Saud being handed o^r to i In view of the possibility of hostile action by Ajaimi against the Samawa- Khamisiya line and of the fact that Saud al Salih was still regarded by the enemy as a considerable asset on our side, Sir P. Cox was unable to accept my recommendations regarding him and decided to defer consideration of tne matter to a more convenient season. My other proposals were however approved and, before the Mission left Basrah, I had several long interviews with Dhari ibn Tawala, with whom 1 finally arranged that he should move down with his following in a ou a month’s time to the neighbourhood of Hafar al Batin, whence he should send a messenger to me, either at Riyadh or Buraida, to get further orders. n issuing these instructions I was actuated by the desire that Dhari and his tribesmen should be within easy reach of my headquarters in case it proved feasible after full discussion with Ibn Saud to bring them into an\ general scheme of action, which might be decided on. In the meantime he was to cut off all communication between Hail and the East and to raid any caravan that might try to slip through. The subsequent course of events prevented my keeping touch with Dhari during the winter months but, on reaching Basrah again in March, 1918, I found two messengers from him arrived in search of me and the arrears of Dhari’s monthly allowance. Accompanying them back to Dhari’s camp I found that the latter had duly carried out my orders in so far that he and, so far as I could see, a very considerable following of the Shammar had for some months past been encamped in the neighbourhood of the wells of Hafar. I was unable to judge whether his blank record in the matter of captured or raided caravans was due to want of reasonable opportunity or want of will. I fear the latter, though up to this date (the beginning of April) he is entitled to receive the benefit of any doubt there may be in the absence of evidence of any treachery on his part. Indeed the favourable opinion I had already formed of him on first acquaintance was enhanced by my short stay in his camp and during the subsequent journey to Shaib Shauki, on which he accompanied me and during which I had every opportunity of intimacy with him. I was a trifle disap pointed to find that he was not less avaricious than others of his kind, but I thought to turn this failing to advantage. Having paid him the arrears of some five months’ allowances due to him I consented to pay him in advance for the following three months on his under taking to remain at Hafar and to institute a vigorous campaign ag’ainst blockade running. In addition to this I distributed liberal presents to Dhari himself, the various Chiefs of sections resident in his camp and to all members of the unnecessarily large escort, with which he thought necessary to accom pany me. Arrived at Shaib Shauki I consulted Ibn Saud regarding the employment of Dhari to further the common cause and, though somewhat sceptical of his good faith, he agreed that the experiment was worth a trial and that Hafar would be the most favourable base of operations for him to work from. During* the few days that Dhari remained at Ibn Saud’s camp I took every opportunity to impress upon him that the continuance of Government’s generous treatment of him depended entirely on his own efiorts to further our common cause and Ibn Saud himself confided to him something of his plans for descending upon the hostile Shammar in Ramdhan, in which case Dhari would be expected to cut off the retreat of the enemy. Thus generously treated and carefully in structed in the role he was to play, Dhari returned to Hafar loudly protesting his gratitude and his intention of abiding loyally by the arrangement arrived at. Within a month of his arriving at Hafar he abandoned his post and moved down to Safwan, where he was apparently received with open arms and with out question. Shortly afterwards, on a report by the Political Agent at Kuwait that I was out of touch with him, he was removed from my jurisdiction without reference to me and, in due course, some 500 camels, loaded with goods from Zubair or Kuwait and franked through by Dhari, arrived at Hail —of this the evidence in my possession leaves no room for doubt. Nor was this all, for, when Ibn Saud’s son, Turki, descended on the Shammar in the neighbourhood of the wells of Ajibba according to the pre arranged programme, the enemy withdrew unmolested to wells further afield, the wells of Hafar being at the time occupied ostensibly on behalf of Dhari, by the Wahab sub-section of the Shammar, who were at enmity with Ibn Saud and offered no opposition to their retreating brethren. It is perfectly clear that Dhari, now knowing that a conflict with his- Shammar brethren would be forced upon him by Ibn Saud’s contemplated' 9 —9 o&amp;ensive, decided to remove himself from the danger zone without delav TTi« ottence is unpardonable and exemplifies the futility of putting any trusf'infhe Shainrnar, whose tribal solidarity is notorious everywdiere in Arabia . t 5 )n , wlla * 1 sr r llds Poli * ic , aI A » ent at Kuwait reported that X was out of touch Dhan I do not know and why, coniine hp 'fL , anything to shew that he came by my permission, he was permitted to settle- aadmit ^ d t0 tke , markets of Zubair and Kuwait I cannot under- stand.

Relations between Najd and Kuwait. . As I have already remarked Lieut.-Col. R. E. A. Hamilton, Political Agent at Kuwait, had been at Riyadh for some three weeks P^ 10 ^ of the Mission. He had left Kuwait about the beginning o Ff ^-r suit of a large Shammar caravan, which had obtained supplies and set out for Hail during his temporary absence at Baghdad. The caravan escaped and Colonel Hamilton passed on into the Qasim, where Ibn Sand s eldest son, Turki, a lad of about 19, was commanding the Najd forces, threatening Jabal ■ Shammar, and thence travelled to Riyadh. On the arrival of the Mission at Riyadh, Colonel Hamilton and I a many opportunities of discussing all questions, which formed a bone of con tention between Ibn Saud and Shaikh Salim of Kuwait, and, at my reques , he remained at Riyadh to give the Mission the benefit of his experience and advice until a definite settlement of the outstanding difficulties between the two rulers was arrived at, namely, till December 5th, when he returned to Kuwait. It was indeed clear from the first that one of these questions the Ajman problem—was of primary importance and that, both on military and on poli tical grounds, the Mission could scarcely hope for success in its main task of inducing Ibn Saud to undertake serious military operations against Ibn Rashid •and Jabal Shammar, unless and until this problem was satisfactorily disposed •of. At the same time it was satisfactory to note in the course of our constant and lengthy interviews will Ibn Saud that he was disposed to come more than half way to meet us in the settlement of the minor questions,—namely the establishment of an effectual blockade of Hail and the right of taxing the Awazim tribe,—if we could settle the major problem to his satisfaction. This was the easier for us inasmuch as—assuming the hostility of the Ajman tribe towards Ibn Saud to be as virulent and uncompromising as his towards them—military considerations alone rendered it imperative to remove the tribe from any position, from which they might be able to threaten his flank or communications in the event of his mobilising for hostilities against Hail. Before proceeding to a discussion of these various problems it will not be out of place to attempt a brief sketch of the relations existing between the houses of Ibn Saud and Ibn Subah up to this point. During the last two decades of the 19th Century, when the Wahhabi dominions bowed to the rule of Ibn Rashid, the scattered remnants of the Saud dynasty sojourned in exile in the various ports of the Persian Gulf Coast. Abdul Rahman, the youngest son of the great Faisal Ibn Saud, after an abortive attempt to re-establish himself in the land of his fathers, sought and was readily granted refuge and hospitality in the town of Kuwait, where he and his family of growing sons lived under the protection, first of Muham mad and then of Mubarak Ibn Subah, awaiting the turn of fortune, which would surely come. Mubarak, ascending the throne of Kuwait by the’murder of his brother, soon came to be recognised as a power to be reckoned with in Arabia. An astute politician and diplomat, he was the equal of the great Sadun and less powerful only than Muhammad Ibn Rashid, then ruler of the whole of Central Arabia. The rivalry of these three resulted naturally in constant fighting, and Mubarak’s wise statesmanship saw in the exiled family of Saud a prospective source of strength in his contests with his rivals and especially u r ith Ibn Rashid. At the beginning of the present Century, i.e., in the Spring of 1901 Mubarak, having entered into alliance with Sadun and accompanied by a Najdi force under the Imam Abdul Rahman Ibn Saud, went forth to fight out the issue with Abdul Aziz ibn Rashid, who had but recently ascended^the throne left vacant by the death of the great Muhammad. Simultaneously Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, the present ruler of Najd, marched with a force of 1 500 men to lay siege to Riyadh. Mubarak and his allies encamped at Tarafiya, while the Shammar lay at Sarif. The battle of Sarif, so-called though fought at Tarafiya, was one of the decisive battles of Badawin history. Mubarak, defeated after a bloody ■ struggle, fled with the remnants of his force and Abdul Aziz, hastily raising the siege of Riyadh, hastened back to Kuwait, but Abdul Aziz Ibn Rashid sealed his own fate by the use he made of his victory, which he followed up by ferocious visitations on the towns and villages of Sudair and other parts of Najd. r The following year Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, with a following of only 15 men, recovered Riyadh by a characteristically daring coup de main and, 'in a few years, the old frontiers of the Wahhabi dominions in Central Arabia’were restored. Abdul Aziz ibn Rashid met his end in battle with Ibn Saud at Raudhat al Muhanna in 190 8 and the positions of Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud in Central Arabia were reversed. This sudden reversal of fortune and the vigorous and rapid establishment of a stable government in Najd by its young ruler could not have been alto gether palatable to Mubarak, who doubtless hoped to increase his own power/jy breaking- that of Ibn Easbid, whereas, in effect, a fourth factor was added to the former Arabian trio and the fourth member soon shewed that he was as strong and as firmly established as any of his rivals. Nevertheless the outward semblance of friendship between Naid and 1 ° h T^ een P r f erved T el1 enough during Mubarak’s lifetime, j as t , 0 ? d of mo F e tllan one occasion, on which he sought 'the benefit of Mubarak s ripe experience and advice, particularlv in reference to the line he should adopt towards the British and Turkish governments nnd has related, only as of historical interest and with no feeling of hostility’ ‘the ^ te ^ %°T S T al f nia( 6 + by Mi ; barak to draw away to himself the allegiance master d ^ ^ praCtlCe ° f P olltlcal intrigue, in which he was a past • ' Jab . ir ' ucce 1 cded Mnbarak the relations to Najd and Kuwait bade fair to follow m the channel marked out in the past. Both rulers were firm m their friendship to the British Government—an additonal inducement to them to maintain cordial relations with each other—but it was well known that Jabir s brother, Salim, heir-presumptive to the Shaikhship, was not only mimical towards the new ruler of Kuwait but had strong leanings towards fl ® f k- 116 ‘i 8 tendellc / to orthodox bigotry marked out Ibn Sand and the Wahhabis as his particular enemies. It was therefore an evil moment for all concerned when Jabir died sud den y and was succeeded at Kuwait by Salim. The latter, indeed, made public profession of his loyalty to the British and of his firm intention to work or the common cause, but his conduct from the beginning has been at vari ance with his professions. Kuwait, which had always—to a certain extent unavoidably—been an outlet for smuggling of goods to enemy destinations, rapidly became notorious as the enemy s mam source of supply, and it must be admitted that, . n all probfibihty, much of the stuff so exported passed through the Qasim to Hml to the profit of the merchants of the former district. Remonstrances by the British authorities to Shaikh Salim were met by the ready reply that Ibn Sauci and not he was responsible for the regrettable state of affairs, while representations to Ibn Saud provoked .the answer that the evil should be • stopped at its source, namely Kuwait. _ Thus the clashing of political—not to sav financial—interests lighted the tram prepared by religious antipathy, and the traditional friendship of the houses of Saud and Subah gave place to enmity, none the less real for bedm to both 111 deiereilCe to t le dlctates a power greater than either and allied ] . ^’afual rerTiminations over the blockade soon gave way to acts of covert po i ica mstiliH. The Ajman tribe, fleeing from Ibn Sand’s vengeance, had and obtained refuge m Kuwait territory before Salim’s accession to the Shaikhship by an arrangement of the British Government, to which Ibn Saud and Jabir were parties and of which an essential condition was that the tribe should behave itself and that those of its leaders, who had sought refuge at Hail or with Ajaimi Ibn Sadun, should not be allowed into Kuwait terri- tory Aeverthdess Salim, seeing m this problem a means of plao-uino- Ibn Saud, made unnecessarily ostentatious parade of his protection of the tribe and welcomed back the proscribed leaders. Ibn Saud retaliated bv taxing tie Awazim tribe, over which Ibn Subah claims sole jurisdiction, when it • crossed ms frontiers m search of grazing. In short, when the Mission arrived at Riyadh, the relations of our two a lesmiere about as strained as they well could be—Salim being in somewhat the stronger position for the time being owing to the natural reluctance of the British authorities to increase the number of their enemies by insisting on the expulsion of the Ajman from Kuwait territory to their only possible resort tne enemy territory of Hail and the desert between it and the Euphrates. 9. The Ajman Problem. 1° understand properly the attitude of Ibn Saud to the Ajman tribe and the bearing of the problem on the politics of Kajd, it is necessary to go back to the sixties and seventies of last century, when the death of Faisal Ibn Saud was followed by a prolonged and sanguinary struggle for the throne between ins two eldest sons, Abdulla and Saud, which ended disastrously not only for Sand, w lio fell in battle, but also for the Sand dynasty itself, whose surviving 1 remnants passed into exile on the usurpation of their dominions by Muhammad Ibn Rashid, the nominal protector and actual master of Abdulla. Palgraye has left on record the impression made on him, during his visit to Riyadh in 1862, by the undisguised antipathy existing between the two brothers, while Faisal was still alive to keep them apart. Abdulla, as the eldest son, succeeded his father, but Saud did not delay long to raise the standard of revolt, while his personality, more pleasing than that of his brother, soon attracted a large following, the nucleus and most important part ‘ ■ of which was supplied by his mother’s tribe, the Ajman.12 ^ -l £ flip varvin 0, fortunes of th6 struggle^ unnecessary here to follo^v the ^ | gau(i ^ SUC ceeded m which ended as already indicated, though n S T)ace—a circumstance WS which ended as aireau.y ° fnr a Uj-ief space—a circumstance wresting the crown from Abdulla to e J y ^ ^ this temporary occu- of capital importance m the nottess^han 0 ^the fact that the line pation of the throne by their ance rlvnastv Abdulla having died of Sand is the senior surviving branch of the &lt;lyn as ty ful ru f ers 0± * childless—the descendants of SaU( J i , a serte( j by open but unsuccessful A T aid a claim, which has been actually assertea uy upc rebellion against the present ruler on more than one occasmn The pretenders have invariably been those members o „ , 4hich from the foreign usurper rather than on /Faisal’sTons the father of the present ruler, being the fouth of 1 aisal sons. The most serious attempt of the pretending line to recover the thron ® occurred Xont the year 1910, when Ibn Sand, surrounded by enemies, dealt with a delicate situation in masterly style. He was, ^Tted theTToneratfon thp fi-mp in war with Ibn Eashid, who successfully invited the co-operation of the Sharif of Mecca. The latter advanced into the IhTTTd^ad him surprising a small Wahhabi force under Saud, brother of Ibn Sand, had him a prisoner before the latter could come to the rescue. Ibn Eashid simultane ously threatened the Qasim on the north and news soon arrived that the southern districts had declared for the AraiP pretenders, who had thought the moment opportune for a bold stroke. At a disadvantage with the Sharif owing to the fact that the latter held his favourite brother, Saad, a prisoner, Ibn Saud consented to the unfavourable terms and, obtaining the release of Ins brother, marched oft to meet Ibn Rashid. Here again negotiations, resulting m a truce, relieved Ibn baud, ot all immediate danger and set him free for a brief campaign m the southern districts, in the course of which he defeated the pretenders and wreaked a terrible vengeance on the towns, which had helped them. Again at the beginning of 1915, when Ibn Saud, accompanied by Captain Sliakespear and acting* as our ally, met Ibn Rashid at the battle of Janab, it was, according to his account, entirely or largely due to the treacherous deser tion of the Ajman contingent at a moment, when their continued support would in all probability have given him a decisive victory, that he had to be content with a drawn battle, in which the honours undoubtedly rested with Ibn Rashid, though he was unable to take any practical advantage of them. This brings us to the final act in the Ajman tragedy, which was played in 1916 in the Hasa, whither Ibn Saud led his forces to avenge himself on the tribe for its perfidious desertion of him at Jarrab and other hostile acts. The Ajman, finding themselves outnumbered, sued for an armistice, to which Ibn Saud, generously enough, agreed on the condition that the contending parties should meet on He morrow to consider arrangements for a permanent peace. Ibn Sand’s brother, Saad, was absent when the armistice was agreed to and, on his return the same evening, found to his mortification that hostilities had be°n suspended. Furious at the lenience of his brother he propounded a scheme for a sudden attack on the unsuspecting tribesmen and Ibn Saud in a weak moment yielded to his vehement pressure. The Ajman, surprised and outnumbered, fought like wild beasts at bay and not only were Ibn Sand’s best troops worsted in the encounter but Saad was counted' among the dead and Ibn Saud himself was wounded, while the victorious tribesmen lost no time in seeking refuge within the borders of Kuwait territory from the vengeance, which was sure to pursue them. Hinc Mae lachrymae l but there can be no doubt that the Ajman, who had appeared up to the last act as the villains of the play, had right on their side in the final denouement and that Saad, by his advocacy of a shameless act of treachery, richly deserved the fate which overtook him. Nevertheless Ibn Saud can scarcely be expected to accept the last arbitra ment of fortune as final nor has he any intention of doing so, if one may judge from the way in which, on anything like a public occasion, he parades the orphaned children of his favourite brother before the public gaze and delivers himself of stirring homilies on the necessity of avenging the wrong done not only to them and himself, but to the honour of his house,—ignoring, with that feminine want of logic so characteristic of the Radawin Arab, the cardi nal consideration that the whole responsibility for the tragedy rests on nobody but himself. *The descendants of Saud Ibn Faisal are known by this nickname owing to the fact that after the battle of Raudhat al Muhanna (1908), in which Abdul Aziz Ibn Rashid was defeated and killed by Ibn Saud, the exiled scions of that line were found among the booty captured in the abandoned camp. The term Arif a or Arafa is commonly used to designate livestock, especially camels, lost to and recaptured from an enemy.+?°7rI er Q tlla j be, 1 ^ arrival of the Ajman as refugees from the wrath of Ibn Saud within the limits of Kuwait territory was a serious matter, • which the British authorities could not afford to ignore. The unconditional admission of the rebels—for such they were—to the benefit of British protec- n uM ai l&gt; t0 aliect °. ur relatlons with an important Arab ally while the dictates both of common justice and indeed of Arab custom demanded that the suppliants should be admitted to sanctuary, at any rate temporarily pend ing fuller consideration of the merits of the case and of the interests involved. was accordingly discussed by Sir P. Cox with Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Kuwait on the occasion of the Kuwait Durbar of November iJlb, and, m view of the greater interests involved in the newly ratified alliance of the Arab rulers with the British Government for the vio'orous piosecution of the war against the common enemy, a compromise was Darned and agreed to by all concerned, whereby Ibn Saud undertook not to molest the Ajman m their new quarters provided that they in their turn refrained from molesting the tribes of Aajd and declined any intercourse with such sections as had betaken themselves to enemy protection. This agreement was intended to remain in force until the end of the war, and it was hoped that the Ajman w T ould be content with the security thus obtained under the protection of the British Government and would on their part faithfully observe the conditions imposed on them. The innate instability of the Arab character, however, soon rendered the hopes entertained of this agreement vain and Ibn Saud declares—with what degree of truth it is impossible to estimate—that a projected forward move ment on his part against the Shammar forces during the summer of 1917 had to be abandoned owing to a sudden movement of the Ajman, which threatened his flank. Theie is no doubt that the Ajman did move in the direction indicated by Ibn Saud, though there is no reason to suppose that their action w r as caused by any other motive than the necessity of finding new pastures for their flocks and herds. Nevertheless the move constituted a breach of the agreement of November, 1916, and, if Ibn Saud did at the time contemplate an attack on the Shammar, the action of the Ajman was sufficient, on military grounds alone, to give him pause, while, finally, Shaikh Salim’s failure to insist on the observance of the agreement by his guests involved the British Government in a charge of breach of faith. Ibn Saud did not miss the opportunity of lodgung a complaint regarding the manner in wdiicli the agreement had been observed bv other signatories than himself, and another opportunity soon presented itself, on the eve of the departure of the Mission from Iraq, in Die arrival at Kuwait of Dhaidan ibn Ilitlain, one of the Shaikhs of the Ajman proscribed by the terms of the agreement. It is true that his petition for sanctuary had been answered bv Sir P. Ccx to the effect that sanctuary could only be granted on the production of a letter of recommendation from Ibn Saud. Nevertheless Dhaidan and his followung took up their residence in Kuwait territory without any such letter and with the consent of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and it was left to the Mission to see what arrangement could be arrived at in consultation with Ibn Saud. Thus, when the Mission arrived at Kiyadh, it found that, on moral grounds alone, Ibn Saud had an unassailable case, as he could point to two distinct breaches of an agreement, which the British Government had ratified but had made no effort to enforce, while he himself had scrupulously observed both its spirit and letter. Moreover the Mission, having as its main object to induce Ibn Saud to active aggression against the enemy, could not leave out of consideration the possible effect of the active or passive presence of a large and hostile force on the flank or rear of Ibn Sand’s army, and we decided that, on military grounds alone, Ibn Saud could not move while the Ajman remained m Kiiwmit territory. Thirdly, on the less plausible ground of political expediency, we thought it advisable to placate Ibn Saud at the expense of a tribe, which, after all, had and has no claim whatever on our friendlv consider ation, when such placation promised substantial results in other directions. Nevertheless, having thus decided on moral military and political grounds that the Ajman must leave Kuwait territory, we used our best endeavours with Ibn Saud to obtain for them as favourable terms as possible; to this end we pointed out to him that on military grounds alone it would be unwise to increase the numbers of, our active enemies, if this could possibly be avoided by securing the neutrality of those, who could not be our friends and had no desire to be our enemies. do this Ibn Saud consented after much argument, and it was finally decided that the Ajman should be le.ft to choose one of the following alternatives, all ol which had the double merit of removing them from Kuwait territory and lessening by one the number of possible sources of friction between Ibn Saud and Ibn Subah, namely: — (1) that the tribe should move en masse northwards and join Fahad ibn ii OUr J ^ llaza (Amarat) ally, thereafter shewing their goodwill to ndhhaJ, our Anaza (Amarat), ally, thereafter shewing their good will tq) the allied cause by acting with him or remaining benevolently neutral; or14 i (2) that the leading Shaikhs of the tribe should come m and make formal .submission to Ibn Sand, who undertook to pardon their past offences on con dition of their settling’ peacefully in such locality as he might appoint; or (3) that, in the event of their declining both of the above alternatives, they must remove themselves forthwith from any British or Kuwait territory, in which they might be, thereafter to be treated as enemies wherever found. This arrangement I communicated in my telegram No. M-4, dated the 2nd December, 1917, informing Sir P. Cox at the same time that, subject to his approval, Colonel Hamilton, on his return to Kuwait, would announce the terms imposed on it to the tribe. I am not quite clear as to the subsequent course of Colonel Hamilton’s dealings with the tribal leaders, but from a note on the tribe written in Sep tember, 1918, by Captain P. G. Loch, then Political Agent at Kuwait, it is clear that his negotiations broke down and that another attempt to find a .solution of the difficulty was made in February, 1918, when an agreement was signed by Colonel Hamilton, Shaikh Salim and Dhaidan ibn Hitlain, the leading (hitherto proscribed) Ajman chief already referred to, whereby the tribe was given an asylum in the neighbourhood of Zubair on the following conditions, namely: — (1) That the whole tribe should take up its residence within the Occupied Territories, i.e., at Zubair or elsewhere as appointed; and (2) that the tribe should on no account re-enter the limits of Kuwait ter- ritory. Moreover, though it was not expressly so stipulated in the agree ment, it was clear that an obligation to refrain from all molestation of Ibn Saud’s territory or tribes was imposed upon the Ajman by these terms—indeed they could not raid into Najd without passing through Kuwait territory and thus transgressing the second of the abovementioned conditions. Thus once more the British Government entered into a pact with the Ajman tribe and from the beginning the arrangements seemed foredoomed to failure. In the first place* after the signature of the agreement, the Ajman shewed themselves to be in no hurry to comply with the condition of taking up their residence at Zubair, and Snaikh Salim made no heroic efforts to enforce or hasten their departure from Kuwait territory; Ibn Saud made constant com plaints regarding their continued presence in Kuwait and I made corresponding representations to the Political Agent. In due course some show of evacuation of Kuwait territory was made by the tribe, which, however, had no sooner taken up its residence in its new quarters near Zubair, than it proceeded to make Kuwait territory a leaping-off ground for a series of raids into Najd, which took place at frequent intervals throughout the summer months. The first raids were against the Subai encampments in Hasa, the Mutair camps were also visited and, towards the •end of the period under report, the raiders began to go as far afield as Hafar al Atsh, Mubayidh and other places not far distant from Ibn Saud’s own capital. It is unnecessary to deal in detail with these raids which met with but a modicum of substantial success and in due course provoked counter-raids by the Mutair, Subai and other elements until, towards the end of the period under report, the whole of the Summan area was in a ferment of unrest through which I passed on my return to the coast, when I had a good oppor tunity of contrasting the security obtaining almost evervwhere in 'ibn Saud’s own territories with the danger and excitement prevalent on the borderlands of Kuwait jurisdiction. During the whole of these months Ibn Saud, who, by his agreement with us, was debarred from taking steps to deal with the Ajman nuisance, while I was pressing him to disregard all minor matters in favour of the vigorous prosecution of the offensive against Hail, maintained an attitude of constant .and not altogether unjustified querulousness, on which I reported with faithful regularity but without success. It was clear that the Deputy Civil Commissioner at Basrah, who was ultimately responsible for the enforcement of the solemn pact of the Ajman was neither disposed to treat the matter (which he regarded as part of the regular game of tribal raid and counter-raid), seriously nor in a position to enforce such parts of the agreement as proved distasteful to the Ajman In these circumstances matters rapidly reached an impasse, for which tlm™ seemed to be no reasonable solution. Meanwhile Ibn Saud was preparing to open his offensive against Hail and I pressed that hostages should be taken from the Ajman to prevent anv possible hostile movement on their part, but even this proved impracticable and finally it was recognised that nothing could be done to enforce the observance by the Ajman of the conditions imposed on them. In these circumstances it was decided :15 1 1 firstly, that the Ajman should be warned that, in the event of the continuance of raids, their subsidies would be stopped and their access to the local markets barred; and Secondly that Ibn Sand should be given a free hand to deal with the lube provided that the safety of the railway was not therebv endangered. J It was with a feeling of considerable relief that I communicated these -orders to Ibn Saud. I was aware that he would not immediately be in a position to take advantage of his newly won liberty in the matter, “while the emoval of a substantial grievance was to be welcomed at a time when the Sharifian situation threatened at any moment to become exceedingly delicate. T ! 1 , e A i n l an Problem has caused Government a great deal of unnecessary Tl a ? d d u e to a perhaps mistaken desire to be lenient to a potentiany hostile element; but it is, m the light of experience, difficult to resist the conclusion that much time, trouble and irritation might have been saved by the acceptance without further ado of the ultimatum propounded by the Mission so long ago as last December and its communication to the tribe. 1 Government had to return after ten months of futile search or a better alternative, during which its desire to serve the interests of an undeserving tribe resulted m the loss of much prestige in Central Arabia and m increasing quite unnecessarily the number of counts, on which Ibn Saud could indulge his querulousness with a f.air show of reason. 10. The Awazim Problem. Inlike the Ajman problem the affair of the Awazim was of transitory interest and presented no serious difficulty. The Awazim had long been recog nised as one of the home tribes of the Kuwait jurisdiction and. in the old days when the friendship of Mubarak and Ibn Saud rendered the delimitation of i-S ±r01 ;r ers 01 Auwa it and INajd unnecessary, they were free to roam in to Kuwait' alone t l6 PaStUreS ° n eitller side of t ' he frontie r while paying taxes The unfortunate differences between Shaikh Salim and Ibn Saud how ever, and especially the. protection accorded by the former to the rebel Ajman old 5 rder of things, and Ibn Saud, by way of retaliation on t e Shaikh of Kuwait for provocation offered, renewed and asserted in practice ns long dormant claim to tax the Awazim graziers, whenever and wherever they entered his territory m search of pastures or, in other words, annually, because the narrow limits of Kuwait jurisdiction can never afford grazing suffi cient for the needs of a Badawin tribe all the year through. In enforcing this claim Ibn Saud was acting well within the rights con ferred by sovereignty. At the same time he had no grudge against or desire to press unduly on the Awazim tribe, which was placed for no fault of its own m the unfortunate position of having to pay double taxes, and was perfectly ready to consent to any reasonable arrangement or indeed to forego altogether his right to tax the tribe—but on terms. Tim settlement of the Ajman question by the effectual expulsion of the tribe from Kuwait territory was an essential preliminary to any such arrange- ment vmle, for the rest, Ibn Saud, after a discussion with the, Mission, under- iook that, if Shaikh Salim wrote to him in suitable terms recalling the friendly arrangement by which, in former times, the Awazim were exempted from the payment of taxes to the Najd treasury and requesting a reversion to the old policy, he would reciprocate by replying in similar terms and formally abjur ing his claim to'tax the tribe thereafter. ■ ^ J Qi .T^ e Q letters were, as a matter of fact, never exchanged and Shaikh Salim xailed to reciprocate m the matter of the Ajman, while, on more -han one occasion, elements of the_ Awazim tribe covered the movements of Ajman and Shammar raiders on their excursions into Hasa. Nevertheless the Awazim problem did solve itself—am,bulando—and it is to Ibn Sand’s credit that he discontinued taxing the tribal flocks and herds without obtaining any thing m the nature of a quid pro quo. &amp; y 11. The Blochade. Though our enemies in this War have undoubtedly enjoyed certain tacti cal advantages over ourselves and our allies by reason of'their geographical co esion, the fact that they are situated within a ring fence almost completely surrounded by enemies has, in another direction, proved a serious disability, m that they have been cut off from the markets of the world and have had to rely on the goodwill of neutrals and the avarice of others to provide them with an always precarious supply of necessary commodities, which they are unable to produce m sufficient quantities in their own territories. To make that supply more and more precarious and indeed to cut it off altogether has therefore naturally been one of the most important military objects of the allies, and the instrument used for the accomplishment of this •end was the Blockade.16 In Mesopotamia tlie Blockade problem presented peculiar difficulties, m that it was always an important part of our policy to enlist t ie &gt; P 1 , J , the Arabs in our cause. It was therefore always considere P . , ,, extend to them all reasonable facilities for providing themselves with the necessaries of life, while ensuring that those necessaries s 1011 no lea enemy, but the Arabs themselves, by failing to reciprocate m the spirit m which we met them, rendered it incumbent on the British authorities to devise measures for the strict enforcement of the blockade. The difficulties experienced in the Occupied Territories of Iraq need not be considered here. Suffice it to say that in the light of experience a fairly effective scheme of blockade was evolved, the effect of which on the enemy became daily more apparent. Bor the complete success of the Iraq scheme however—involving, as it did, a rigorous blockade of the northern part of the Arabian peninsula by the establishment of a cordon along the Euphrates line—it was essential that no leakage of supplies should occur through neighbouring neutral or friePdly countries not under our control, and in this connection Eastern and Central Arabia with its inlets on the Persian Gulf coast had long been an object of anxious consideration. It was obviously absurd to expect uncontrolled Arabs—whether Badawin or Hadhr—not to take advantage of the enormous profits to be made by meet ing the enemy’s demands for supplies. At the same time it was out of the question to adopt the simple expedient of blockading the Persian Gulf ports, as such a course would have involved our friends in the same fate as our enemies. The course adopted was to enlist the active co-operation of the Arab rulers allied to us, namely, Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Kuwait, the one to prevent leakage of supplies across his frontier to the enemy and the other to refuse access to the Kuwait market to enemy purchasing agents. The arrangements by which these objects were to be achieved were left entirely to the discretion of the two rulers themselves in accordance with our con sistent policy of refraining from interference in the internal arrangements of native states except when circumstances make it absolutely necessary to do so. The experiment was, unfortunately, doomed to failure from the begin ning and it failed—its only substantial result being to enhance the bitterness and antipathy already existing between Ibn Saud and Ibn Subah. Indeed, some time before the departure of the Mission from Baghdad, information from prejudiced and unprejudiced sources made it abundantly clear that Kuwait had, in consequence of the tightening of the Iraq blockade, begun to enjoy a profitable monopoly as a source of enemy supply, while the Qasim was profiting by the enjoyment of corresponding advantages as a dis tributing centre. The climax was reached towards the end of September, 1917, when a caravan of 3,000 enemy camels came down tq Kuwait through the Qasim with a passport signed by Ibn Sand’s eldest son, Turki, who was at the time in command of the forces nominally engaged in preventing the leakage of supplies to the enemy. _ The debacle was completed by the clear ance of the same caravan, loaded with supplies from Kuwait with the sanction or connivance of the Shaikh himself in spite of specific orders telegraphed from Baghdad that it should be detained pending further consideration. Colonel Hamilton pursued the caravan without result and the enemy, doubtless, duly received a welcome addition to their stores, but matters were now seen to be really serious and our allies had shown themselves to be broken reeds. The Mission was accordingly directed to discuss the question of the blockade with Ibn Saud and to submit proposals for its stricter enforcement while the question of the feasibility of establishing’ a proper blockade post on Iraq lines at Kuwait began to engage attention. The incident of the Shammar caravan above referred to proved to be a blessing in disguise, in that it provided me with a solid and notorious fact, on which to base both a complaint as regards the past and an ultimatum in respect of the future. To do him justice, Ibn Saud made little serious at tempt to defend his untenable position. As regards Turki’s action, he ex plained that the passport given to the caravan was in no sense intended to give the Shammar export facilities from Kuwait—it was indeed merely a safe conduct through the Najd tribes on the road, but he could not explain the extension to enemy subjects of even such a concession as this. Doubtless Shaikh Salim’s explanation of the clearance of the enemy caravan was equally conyincing. H ^ As regards the caravan itself, Ibn Saud admitted that it could only have gone to the enemy and, as regards enemy trade in general, he inveighed strongly against the Shaikh of Kuwait as being personally and deeply impli cated in contraband business, out of which he made large 'profits. He assert ed that the bulk of the traffic-went direct from Kuwait to Hail or Damascus giving his own frontiers a wide berth, but he admitted that the merchants- of the Qasim were also to a certain extent involved. On my pointing out however, that this was scarcely consistent with his own solemn undertakings;ir 1 1 lie admitted the impeachment and merely pleaded that, so lono&gt; as smnffedim? _ a n J arge sc f le was P^tised m Kuwait to the profit of the lo°cal merc!iants° it v.as scarcely reasonable to expect him to penalise the merchants of Ms Q“ S_mdeed ^ C0UW UOt d ° S ° Wlth0Ut -io us %rk of^nh^Te Colonel Hamilton and I eventually proposed that a system of Basse* should be introduced, whereoy facilities for export from Kuwait wou'T'iX' g-ranted only to persons certified by the possession of such passes, signed by Ibh Saud or his local Amzrs, to be Ibn Saud’s subjects and reliable'indivK duals, and on the condition that Ibn Saud himself should accent ne^soml responsibility that goods, so exported, should not pass his frontier P &lt; 1 He demurred slightly at an arrangement so novel to Arab ideas and offered us an alternative to undertake the policing of the Kuwait frontier • Such an arrangement, however, amounting as it did to a request for free permission to vex and harass the Shaikh of Kuwait and his people could not for a moment be entertained; and for want of any other suftaWe altemaW bv ?h?f t0r the a S Ce ? ance ° f our ori ^ mal pronosals, to which Ibn Saud— by this Lime assured of a satisfactory settlement of the Ajman question— eventually assented on the understanding that the British Government would enemy! rl ° US StePS t0 preveilt a11 direct smuggling from Kuwait itself to the It was accordingly arranged as follows: —namely, (1) that Ibn Saud should undertake the vigorous blockade of enemy erritory accepting full personal responsibility that no supplies destinaticm^ ed ^ teiTltories ’ sllould leave tPem for an enemy (2) that the British Government should arrange for an effective blockade system at Kuwait; (3) that permission to export from Kuwait would not be conceded to o? resTdence Pr0Vlded Wltil a paSS Slgned tlle Amir of p is place (4) that such permission would on no account be granted even to nendly Shammar elements unless they were accompanied by a responsible representative of Ibn Saud himself; and, (o) that a form of pass, evolved in the course of our discussions, should be introduced without delay and distributed to the local Amirs, ioi use the bearer of the pass would be required to present it to the British authorities at Kuwait, to be endorsed bv them with the quanuty of each article to be exported and, on his arrival at his destination, he would appear before the local Amir, who would endorse on the pass the quantities of each article duly brought to the intended destination, the document being even- K /° endor f d and si gmed, to the British author ities at Kuwait for record. f ^.Hot content with the consummation of this agreement, we lost no onnor- a H-b °i impressing on Ibn Saud that his interests, no less than those of the British Government were at stake and that the importance of p?eventiW supplies reaching the enemy could not be exaggerated He accordiimlv despatched letters to his Amirs, and particularly to those of the Qasim plammg the urgent necessity of implicit obedience to and strict enforcement of his orders-addmg incidentally that he had entered into a solemn under taking with the British Government in this respect the advantages of wliMK to his own subjects would become apparent in due course g Coionei Hamilton returned to Kuwait to make arrangements to Mve effect to the policy thus agreed on and some little delay occurred in work in o- out the necessary details and removing the difficulties incidental to the estab- hshment ffi a blockade pos t a t Kuwait; but, in due course, a blockade Officer was appointed to that pest and everything was ready for the inception of a scheme destined, it was hoped, to complete the cordon shuttinS out the enemy from all access to the markets of the outer world. ° This was the position when I returned to Ibn Saud in April 1918 According ^ 0 custom large enravans from the interior had takeiHadvantage of the spring season to go down to the coast to bring up supplies for the summer Towards the end of the month, disturbing reports began to come through to the effect that all the caravans had been turned away empty in Xw a H e? r 1C1 n te f t0 , Ca T ^f rm - Tt is not too much to say Hat the vl ole of Aa.id, suddenly faced with the prospect of spending the summer without supplies^ was m a ferment. The military precautions, including the placmg of machine guns on the roof of the Political Agent’s residence at Shuwaikh and the landing of a detachment of troops, taken to obviate the occurrence of trouble m connection with the turning away of the caravans were commonly interpreted as an act of hostility towards the people of Kajd P °f llCy o£ ^ lend . s ! li P with tlle British Government came in for a good deal of unfavourable criticism.18 The authorities at Kuwait had failed to realise this “ f or the necessity of keeping me informed of their ac 10 “&gt; w * , t 0 me * I while complaints poured in to Ibn Saud and w f® du ^. P® SS “ k “ was not in a position to afford an explanation ot tlie action taken or o± t e reasons therefor. i j • It was clear to me, however, that some mistake had occurred and, in view of the risk of disturbance inherent in delay, I felt that no course was open to me but to give certain guarantees regarding the futuie on behalf of the Kuwait authorities. I accordingly arranged with Ibn Saud that all Najd caravans should be accompanied by special envoys on his behalf, that his Kuwait Agent, Abdulla al Nafisi, should be appointed his special representative m respec of tribal parties, who were not in a position to come m to procure special envoys, e.g., the eastern tribes such as Mutair and Subai, and, finally, that all regular town caravans should carry passes signed by the locol Amirs These arrangements I at once communicated to the Political Agent at Kuwait, assuring Ibn Saud, at the same time, that the caravans already turned away uould now return to bring up supplies, which would not be refused provided the arrangements as regards passes and envoys were duly observed. At the same time I pointed out to the Political Agent, firstly, that it was not altogether reasonable to restrict exports into the interior from Kuwait on the basis of pre-war trade, because, in those days, the interior used to draw supplies^ from Mecca, Damascus and Basrah among other places, whereas, under existing conditions and with the restriction of shipping to the Hasa ports, Kuwait had come to be the sole source of supply to Najd and, secondly, that, in view of the arrangements made by the Mission with Ibn Saud in consultation with Colonel Hamilton, the responsibility of the Kuwait authorities was restricted to the prevention of illicit and unauthorised export only, while Ibn Saud was responsible that no goods, exported to Najd under proper authority, should leave his territories for an enemy destination. Suffice it here to say that the arrangements now proposed by me were promptly accepted, and the due clearance of the Najd caravans previously turned away created a satisfactory revulsion of feeling throughout Ibn Sand’s territories, and an episode, which had caused so much ill feeling, served very well to remind the people of Najd of what the British Government could and would do in the event of their abusing the privileges extended to them. While on this subject, I should mention that the Kuwait debacle was universally attributed in Najd to the machinations of Shaikh Salim, who was, at the time, undoubtedly piqued by the establishment of effective British control of the blockade and could not have found a better weapon, wherewith to oppose it, than to make the arrangements weigh heavily on the people of Najd, who could be trusted not to remain silent under such provocation. The proclamation issued by him—apparently at the request of the British authorities—and the unsympathetic manner, in which it was enforced, lent colour to the accusations made by the Najdis. Be that as it may, the acceptance of my proposals restored confidence in Najd, Ibn Saud promptly set to work to ensure the effective stoppage of smug gling from the Qasim—one of his first acts was the summary dismissal of the Amir of Zilfi, who was notorious for complicity in the smuggling business and by a strange coincidence, of which Shaikh Salim was not unaware, had been the only person privileged to export supplies from Kuwait, when the rest of the Najd caravans were turned away—and everything bade fair at last for the establishment of an effective blockade all round. The only person, who was not satisfied, was Shaikh Salim, regarding whose machinations for the reversal of the arrangements above described this is not the place to speak. On the 28th June I was able to report that Ibn Saud was completely satisfied that the interests of his people in the matter of the block ade were being duly safeguarded and, at the same time, I expressed the hope that the official blockade would be maintained as affording the onlv hope of cutting off supplies from enemy elements. In short, everything seemed to be in a fair way to a sufficiently satisfactory solution of the blockade problem when, about the middle of July, I received the news that Government had decided once more to place their trust in Shaikh Salim and to leave the prose cution of the blockade entirely in his hands, on the condition of his accepting the services of a British Officer to assist his own blockade staff. At the same time it was decided that imports into Kuwait from India and elsewhere should be regulated on the basis of the reasonable monthly requirements of Kuwait and its dependent tribes. The Political Agent at Kuwait had, on July 4th, addressed a letter to Shaikh Salim on behalf of H.M.’s Government communi cating the sanction of the Government to these arrangements. The news of this development of the situation was naturally extremely un palatable to Ibn Saud, who saw Shaikh Salim once more given a free hand to promote smuggling to the enemy and to make the blockade, such as it remained, irksome to the people of Najd. I reported that at the very moment, when these arrangements were being made, certain enemy caravans w^ere actually present19 natter ; that, me, I tli e in 3 was ilf of jfintj spect 3cial that lin, 'ait, way ded tlie ier : of om ing ait ew ith ed lid Id re T ’s V d n a f me ti T’ in T V i eW 0f Ib f* Saud ’ s disclaimer ol reeponsi- i Q+ ' y ior the leakage of supplies, I foresaw the recommencement of friction t T r ^ 1 * * * * AT rS ’i aS ! tlle first P ers0Ils to ta ke advantage of the new reqime ke people of ^aJd, the enforcement against whom of the new restrictions could not fail to give rise to endless complaint and correspondence ^criticised the scheme in detail and suggested that, if the importance of maintaining -ood relations with t^e Shaikh of Kuwait rendered persistence in the scheme inevitable, the markets of Kuwait should be definitely closed to all Kafdis and arrangements for the supply of the needs of the interior made throug-h the Hasa ports, over which Ibn Saud had firm and undivided control. ° In making these proposals, I was under the misapprehension that thp pass system had been suspended, which was not the case. Nevertheless the objection remained that Najd caravans would have to apply for passes not as heretofore to the British Officer in charge of the Blockade, but to Shaikh Salim s representative. It seemed to me obvious that endless possibilities of riction remained and, m view of the growing delicacy of the Sharifian . situation I was anxious to remove all possible minor sources of dissatisfaction m order to have a free hand to deal with bigger issues, when they arose • be remembered that at this time, while the Khurma affair was .seriousiy threatening the peace of Arabia and I was endeavouring to divert Ibn Saud s attention from it to the campaign against Hail, I was faced on all sides by a series of petty difficulties of an exceedingly irksome nature, which vere making Ibn Saud and his people querulous against the general policy of the British Government towards Najdean susceptibilities. Our policy towards the Shammar was causing much dissatisfaction and laying us open to the charge, that we were^ not serious m our desire for their elimination; our under takings m regard to the Ajman were rapidly breaking down with the inevitable result of unrest and nervousness m Najd and now, once more, the commercial interests of Najd were placed at the mercy of Shaikh Salim, while evidence was of^ife 7 accumulatm 8‘ Ibat the Shammar smugglers were enjoying a new lease , T J ie lore 0 . °f my general contention was recognized, firstly, by the Poli- iical Agent himself, who, however, urged that, the new arrangements with the Shaikh being based on a policy of trust, he should be given another chance of shewing his loyal adherence to British policy and that, if that failed, resort might be had to the diversion of Najd commerce to the Hasa ports as proposed by me; and, secondly, by Sir P. Cox, who on his arrival at Kuwait m August, 1918 on his return from England, arranged, in con- suitation with the local authorities and Shaikh Salim, that passes for Najd -s lould as before, be issued by the Blockade Officer and that the Shaikh’s blockade operations should be confined to other elements only. This last arrangement was in fact a reversion to the arrangement evolved on the basis of my representations in the previous May and, on the 4th Sep tember, 1918 I was able to report that Ibn Saud had expressed himself once more completely satisfied with the revised scheme. From this point to the end of the period under report, when, in conse quence of the G.-m-C. s peace proclamation at Baghdad, the blockade was or all practma,! purposes suspended, the blockade problem remained quies cent, though I was able to report a number of cases of smuggling from Kuwait winch took place m September after the acceptance of responsibility for the new arrangements by Shaikh Salim, who, to the end, kept up the double smu^gffirs^ 6 ^ 111 ^ t0 enforce tiie blockade and actually assisting the enemy i .Sumniing up the results of the year, I find it difficult to resist the con clusion that, on the whole, Ibn Saud exerted himself honestly and energeti- Ca -n n° c l° se bis territories to the operations of enemy purchasing agents with the result that, except for one petty case of smuggling reported by me m July, no definite case came to my notice. On the other hand numerous instances of the passage of caravans from Kuwait to Hail were reported from time to time, evidence was forthcoming of the accumulation of stocks at the latter place and their eventual clearance by a caravan of 1,000 camels to amascus, wdule, finally, there seemed to be good ground to suppose that : uri S AT an , ^ho had access to Aqaba, w^as making use of his position to profit by the contraband trade. n ^ If, as regards Kuwait, it is possible to suggest what would have been an effective remedy for an intolerable situation, I venture to think it would have been found in the diversion of Najd commerce to the Hasa ports as I proposed; but, doubtless, the scarcity of shipping militated against the accept ance of the proposal at the time when it was made. This matter has, how ever, another and more permanent aspect wffiich merits a few words of ex planation before I pass from this subject. . It must be remembered that, since Ibn Saud re-established himself in ns ancestral territories in 1902, he has been so busily engaged in the task ot political consolidation, culminating in the capture of Hasa from the Turks an tne spring of 1914, that he has had little leisure to consider the question ~120 . t ^ v;* noimtrv When at last, in 1914, he- of the commercial development of h . is , to this subject and his finan- found himself in a position to turn i a bout for ways and means of cial needs made it imperative for Hasa ports, the development improving his revenues, his eyes turned to his immediate of which, as the normal avenues of Na]dean commerce, oeca At this point, the outbreak of the war^and^the ^^^^^hgrace? he ha^rec^gniz^^hat t^^BriUs^ Government was unable, for the time being, to forward his plans by the provision of s matter andj wll en blockade Nevertheless, he has never lost sig i ‘ reason for pressing his difficulties arose at Kuwait he saw m them a g ^ he was suffe ring a claims for the recognition of his own pom . ^ d Goods, arriving at loss of customs revenue, which he a t that port Bahrain for through export to Najd, are liable to c Ibn Saud collects hE/Sek 0 -“’ ^ subject to a single tariff, the port ol Kuwait enjoys extraordinary advantages over the Hasa ports in respect of inland trade. If nWimm that after the war, Ibn Saud, who has now firmly estab- Bffied his rule through the length and breadth of Najd, including the Qasim, will not Lntinue to buffer the loss of so much revenue with equanimity; and the Hternative^open to him will be either to offer lower rates and other facilities in respect of imports direct to the Hasa ports, whose revenues won flow entirely into his coffers, or to enter into mutually satisfactory tariff arrangements with the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait whereby a reasonable percentage of the customs revenue of those ports would be paid to himseit. In view of the very rapid growth of the standard of living in Central Arabia in recent years, during which money has poured into the country, more particularly from the west, and of the heavy demands for piece-goods foodstuffs and other commodities likely to ensue during the coming era ot peace, this question of the trade of Najd and the reasonable division of profits arising therefrom is one, which deserves the serious attention ot H.M. s Government. In this place it is not possible to do more than to state the problem in its simplest aspect. 12. Ibn Sand’s Operations against Hail. At the end of October, 1917, the military situation in Central Arabia was extremely obscure. Since the death of Captain Shakespear at the battle of Jarrab in January, 1915, Ibn Saud, left to his own resources, had failed to continue the campaign then interrupted at its inception. The impetus given to his flagging zeal by the conversations of 1916, backed by the grant of a regular subsidy and a substantial addition to his armament, was spent without any substantial result. Ibn Rashid was known to have left his capital and to be with the Turks at A1 Hajar, near Madain Salih, on the Hijaz railway, while his confidential agent, Ibn Laila, had gone to Damascus presumably to consult the Turkish High Command regarding his master’s affairs. Hail was left to the care of its garrison under the command of a trusted slave. Finally, Ibn Saud, according to his own account, had been maintaining pressure on Jabal Shammar, watching for an opportunity to strike, until the beginning of Ramdhan, when he resigned the command of the forces in the Qasim to his son, Turki, and returned to his capital. Turki had effected nothing and was not likely to do so. Meanwhile the Sharif’s denunciations of Ibn Sand’s lukewarmness in the allied cause were becoming more frequent and uncompromising, as well as more difficult to refute on behalf of our ally, and the High Commissioner for Egypt voiced the opinion of all authorities concerned, when he expressed the hope that “ time and the successful completion of the Mission, resulting, it is hoped, in active aggression against the Turks on the part of Ibn Saud would prove to the King the folly of his present policy of suspicion and the wisdom of effecting a reconciliation with his nearest powerful neighbour.” The principal object of the Najd Mission was, therefore, to launch Ibn Saud into a campaign of active aggression against the Turks, which I inter preted, for all practical purposes, as meaning a campaign against Ibn Rashid with the capture of Hail as its chief objective, and it may be assumed that Government neither intended nor desired that Ibn Saud should be committed to such a venture with inadequate resources at his disposal. It was indeed to obviate such a contingency, that a responsible military officer was attachedto the Mission, to enable it to speak with authority on military matters and it necessary to estimate the amount of assistance required to make the resources ot I bn baud adequate to the task in view. It was consequently not a little disappointing to find that, when, at last, the tram was laid and ready to fire, not only was the charge proposed consi dered excessive, but doubts had arisen regarding the value of the objective itself. It was, indeed, perfectly clear that the achievement of the proposed object by Ibn Saud would but confirm the King in his folly and make a recon ciliation between him and his nearest powerful neighbour impossible and, that being so, the purely military advantages likely to accrue from the capture of Hail were not such as to warrant any serious effort on our part. However that may be, the first efforts of the Mission were directed to the task of forming an estimate of the relative strength of the two Central Arabian chiefs m men and armament. As regards Ibn Saud, we knew, at the outset, that he had, some twelve months before, received from us four Turkish moun tain guns, four Maxims and 3,000 rifles with corresponding quantities of ammunition, and that four of his men had been instructed at Basrah in the handling of machine guns. At the very outset of our journey, namely, at Uqair, we were not a little surprised to find the whole of the local garrison—some 50 men—armed with modern rifles, and we were informed that the garrison at Qatif had also' been armed out of the gift intended for another purpose; but a worst shock awaited us at Hufuf, where, after considerable reluctance on the part of the local governor, Abdulla ibn Jiluwi, we were permitted to inspect the military equipment stored in the fort. Here we found all the four maxims still in the cases in which they had arrived a year before, two of the mountain guns and a considerable stock of rifles* and ammunition. To add to our disappointment, we were informed that three of the four men, who had been instructed in the use of machine guns at Basrah, were dead, while the fourth, who w T as present, made it quite clear, by a practical demonstration, before us that he had for gotten all he had learned.! The information gleaned at Hufuf was not a little disconcerting and seemed to indicate that Ibn Saud was economising his military resources to meet postwar developments; but I think, on the whole, that this view was a little unjust to Ibn Saud, regarding the internal state of whose territories we then knew next to nothing. I'orlnstance, it soon became quite clear that Hasa could not be left unprotected, while the Ajman continued to threaten its north- ern boundaries. Nevertheless, Ibn Sand’s dispositions were justly open to the criticism that, whatever his policy might be, he had not taken full advantage of the addition to his armament, which he had received from us; it was clear that the making of such gifts to him with no guarantee of their effective utilisation constituted a waste of resources. 1 did not lose the opportunity of taxing Ibn Saud with his neglect of the resources placed at his disposal for the purpose, I said, of enabling him to prosecute an offensive against the common enemy. He replied that our gift of the previous year had not been accompanied by any such condition—and, so far as I have since been able to ascertain, he was right on this point—but he admitted the general impeachment and accepted my suggestion that, at any rate, the machine guns would be more _ effective in active operations against, the enemy than in their packing cases in the fortress of Hufuf. He accord ingly agreed to send for them and they duly arrived at Riyadh and eventually accompanied Ibn Saud as far as Buraida, but no further. As regards his armament generally, we ascertained by enquiry from Ibn Saud and others that, in addition to the machine guns already mentioned, there were 10 or 12 serviceable though, owing to lack of trained personnel' not very effective guns of the Turkish mountain-gun type (T-pounders), of which about six w T ere m the Hasa or at Qatif. Of rifles, i.e., modern wea pons, Ibn Saud admitted to having about 6,000, inclusive of those received from us, with an adequate supply of ammunition, bqt I assumed his figures to be below the mark, as he obviously had everything to gain and nothing to lose by minimising his own and exaggerating his enemy’s resources. I accordingly fixed my estimate at 8,000 modern rifles, to say nothing of less effective weapons, which would doubtless appear in considerable numbers in case of need. Little reliable information was forthcoming with regard to Ibn Rashid’s armament. It was known that the fortress of Hail contained a number of guns, while the information I was able to collect, supported by the intrinsic probabilities of the case, led me to reject reports—emanating,'l think, from From such information as I could collect, I estimated the total number of modern rifles in the Hasa, Qatif and Uqair at between 600 or 700. I think it was probably nearer 1,000. tHe and a few others subsequently profited by Colonel Cunliffe Owen’s instruction and became more or less competent to handle the machine guns.22 Egypt—that the defences of the town were in a dilapidated condition Sand himself credited Ibn Rashid with four or five Turkmh Mountain gim and no less than 20,000 modern rifles. The latter figure seemed to bean obvious exaggeration, in view of the^fact that j^ nn au -r sa f e the total manpower of Hail and its tribes at only ^15, +r&gt; r’orlnno ftio sItpti ccth of the enemv to X2,00U n and five guns. On this basis it seemed to the Mission that, while Ibn Saud was, without question, able to command numbers of men far m excess of anything that the enemy could produce, he was considerably inferior to him m rifle equip ment and about equal in guns, if allowance be made for the fact that he could not safely risk denuding the whole of his territory of its defences, while the whole strength and armament of the Shammar would be available to defend their capital, to say nothing of any accretion of strength, which Ibn Eashid might subsequently be able to extract from the Turks m face of a serious threat to his territory. In the matter of men and armament, therefore, we came to the conclu sion that, for the purpose of attacking Hail with a reasonable prospect of success or at any rate without serious risk of disaster in the event of failure, Ibn Saud should take the field with not less than 15,000 men and rather more artillery than he had. Colonel Cunliffe Owen, at my request, drew up an appreciation of the situation, in which, having arrayed the available evidence before us, he set forth what he considered to be the reasonable military re quirements of Ibn Saud for the task expected of him. The financial and other aspects of the situation had yet to be considered, as Ibn Saud made it quite clear from the beginning that, owing to shortage of shipping and the consequent depreciation in the price of dates, which con stitute one of the few exportable commodities of Najd (chiefly Hasa), and other contributory causes, his existing financial resources, including the sub sidy which he was receiving from 'Government, were not sufficient to enable him to keep anything like a large force in the field for any length of time. This point I readily appreciated, as it was known that, in wages alone, to say nothing of provisions, etc., the Sharif’s troops were costing him £5 or £6 per man per month. At the same time, I noticed with satisfaction that his financial difficulties loomed larger in his eyes than his deficiencies in arma ment and were indeed of a serious and pressing nature, as the regal hospitality of the court, both at the capital and in camp, involving as it does the feeding of an average of probably not less than 1,000 souls twice daily was placing Ibn Saud under obligations to his creditors, about his ability to meet which he had good reason to feel uneasy. In addition to this, tribal subsidies con stituted a heavy drain on his resources—the heavier for the competition he had recently been suffering from the Sharif. So far as I could ascertain, the bulk of Ibn Sand’s resources consists of income derived from three sources, namely,— (1) Customs duties at the ports of Jubail, Qatif and Uqair, amounting to about Es. 4 lakhs per annum; (2) Land revenue on dates, wheat, rice, etc., in the Hasa and Qatif cases, amounting to about Es. 6 lakhs per annum; and, (3) the British subsidy of £5,000 per month or Es. 9 lakhs per annum. In addition to these sources of revenue, he derives an income from land taxes in the Qasim, regarding which I was unable to ascertain the full details, while his own statement that the proceeds of the annual taxes, collected by him on camels and sheep, are more than counterbalanced by tribal subsidies, I accepted as substantially correct. Before leaving Basrah, I had taken the precaution of providing myself with a substantial sum of money, the actual presence of which, stored partly at Uqair and partly at Eiyadh itself, proved to be a strong’ factor in the subsequent negotiations with Ibn Saud, to whom, as an earnest of what he might expect in the event of his active co-operation with us in military operations, I lent n sum of £10,000 on the seourity of future instalments of his subsidy, before I left Biyadh on my journey to’Taif. If serious military operations were to be attempted, it was clear that the task of financing^ them would have to fall on the British Government, which was already bearing the Sharif’s expenses on a lavish scale. In order, there fore, to form an estimate of .the amount of money required I assumed that a certain sum would be requisite for the initial purchase of transport animals and provisions for, at any rate, the early stages of the campaign, and that a regular monthly allotment would be necessary to enable him to keep his forces in the field. The former I estimated at £20,000 to be expended half on the purchase of 1,000 transport camels at an average price of £10 a head and a half on the purchase of rice and other necessary foodstuffs; the monthly * *My view in this matter was justified in that, when Ibn Saud did eventually arrive at Hail the fortifications proved too formidable to allow of any assault unsupported by artillery.K 23 allotment I calculated on the basis of a minimum force of 10 000 men con tinuously in the field, at an all round rate of £5 per man’per month to (1) Family allotments, without which the Arab will not take the field; (2) The pay of the troops; and^ (3) The cost of provisions, etc. 1 tll „ us arrive d at a fairly clear idea of what was really requisite in the matter of armament and funds for the proposed campaign, and it only remained to extract from Ibn Saud a definite undertaking that he would undertake hostilities if provision were made on the scale Indicated This rs^edhimlh^liT 00 ' 81 ^' 1 ^^ 1 ^' ^ Saud ’ s owrexp^taW, but I assured him that it would be idle to make more ambitious proposals in view hn P.IpsW ° f th 1 e Shari / ,s operations and of P our P own oftensfvT m Palestine, while I impressed upon him that vacillation on his part at that juncture might result m his getting nothing.

This, at any rate, was, to my mind, the ^^Xwed, take of the decision arrived at—on this point I was not mnt f with o-reat anxiety the possible outcome of his discontent m the e\ent ol y being unable to keep him actively employed with the slender means placed a my disposal. . i x r n However the orders of Government were final and, knowing what I did o Ibn Sand’s financial straits, I hoped for the best from a judiciou 8 manipula tion of the financial discretion allowed me. I, accordingly, set out o y return to Ibn Sand to communicate the orders of Government which were as follows, namely: — (1) that H.M.’s Government were pleased to sanction the conversion into a gift of the sum of ,£10,000 advanced to Ibn Saud by myself as a loan before leaving Riyadh; (2) that, while unable to provide artillery, small arms and personnel on the scale proposed, H.M.’s Government were pleased to make Ibn Saud a present of 1,000 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammuni tion ; and (3) that, while recognising that operations on the scale originally con templated would be clearly impossible, H.M.’s Government were anxious that Ibn Saud should maintain pressure on the Sham- mar and keep up a rigorous blockade and were, therefore, prepared to offer him a substantial lump sum of money—the amount actually stated by me to Ibn Saud was £50,000—and the doubling of his existing subsidy of £5,000 per mensem, in the event of his capturing Hail with the means at his disposal. It is idle to pretend that Ibn Saud was anything but disgusted by this- whittling down of the original programme. He attributed Government’s change of views to the machinations of the Sharif, regarding whose attitude to himself my escort, returning from Jidda to Riyadh without me, had brought back lurid and extravagant tales. His main point, how’evem was that the state of his finances did not admit of his maintaining anything like active operations in the field against Ibn Rashid and that, consequently, the decision of Gov ernment was tantamount to the abandonment of its original plans for active co-operation with him against the enemy. The promise of handsdome treat ment in the event of his accomplishing a task, wfiich he could not attempt, was of little practical advantage to him, and he made it clear that, if the com munication I had made to him represented the final considered orders of Government, he could not but bow to their decision and regret his inability to be of further active assistance. Ibn Sand’s attitude did not surprise me, nevertheless, I was faced with the prospect of the termination of my Mission, conscious that to leave Ibn Saud to his own devices in a temper of dejection and dissatisfaction might involve serious consequences, in the event of his relations with the Sharif becoming acute. I determined, therefore, at all costs, to maintain my position, where I was, and, with this object in view, took the responsibility of ofiering Ibn Saud a loan of the money lying idle at Uqair—amounting to about £20,000—on the condition of his making preparations for mobilisation for a campaign against Ibn Rashid. These arrangements tided over the first few months of the summer and placed me in a strong position, in that, while my right to remain with Ibn Saud could not be questioned so long as he was unable to repay the loan, I was able to oppose to his querulousness under provocation from the Sharif, the Ajman, etc., the objection that the remedy for his ills lay in the vigorous prosecution of the offensive against Hail, which I had placed in a position to undertake. The political situation grew steadily worse during the summer and the people of Najd grew restive under two attacks on their co-religionists at Khurma by the Sharif, constant Ajman raids, blockade difficulties, etc., but, being at the end of my resources;^ I could only preach the Hail offensive as a general panacea, and Ibn Saud realised that he must take action, if he wished to deserve further assistance. Meanwhile preparations for the offensive, into which he threw himself with much zeal and energy, served to divert his atten tion from the Sharif. Turki, the eldest son of Ibn Saud, opened the offensive against the Sham- mar in July from the wells of Ajibba but was disappointed of his prey, the Shammar tribesmen withdrawing before his advance until they were beyond his reach. The defection of Dhari ibn Tawala had materially assisted the Shammar in their escape. If was not till the 5th August that Ibn Saud was ready to start off with his main force and the first blow was struck at Hail towards the end of Septem ber^ whenlbn Saud, the first of his line to reach the walls of Hail as an enemy, having missed by dilatory tactics a providential opportunity of capturing Ibn Rashid and his bodyguard in the open, raided the environs of the town and, unable to tackle Ibn Rashid in the hill-girt stronghold of Aaiwij Baqaa, fell upon the Shammar herdsmen outside Hail and, having killed some 30 of them,25 came away with a rich booty including 1,500 camels, 10,000 rounds of ammuni- tion, many sheep and much camp furniture. lit refused to allow me to accompany this expedition on the ground of the fanaticism of his own force, practically entirely urawn irom ^ntdd ^ n + e l eineIlt f' an 1 + part1 ^ doubtless, owing to his own douots, which he could not bring- himself to admit, regarding the issue of the venture and hi &gt;4 memory of the fate of Captain Shakespear on the last occasion when he tried conclusions with Ibn Rashid. I rejoined him, however, at Qusaiba on his return from Hail expedition on the 25th September and found him so confided as the result of his expedition that he readily waived all further objection to my remaining with him. Meanwhile I had obtained authorisation from you—m vmw of the necessity of keeping Ibn Saud actively employed—to keep •him in funds to the extent of £10,000 monthly, and the communication to hTm of this news had so favourable an effect, that the arrival, almost at the same moment, of the news of a third unsuccessful attempt on Khurma b V the Sha- Tt T1 p Tvi S / ai i ed , t ° da T P il 1S bao y anc y- He was very confident of bringing untimt object 1 wtTttefned? ^ t0 teeP Up at lligh pressure Little did he or I know of the disappointment in store for him.

The Sharif and Ibn Saud. In the previous section I have had occasion to refer brie y to ^hiect incompatibility of the ambitions of the Sharif an m atL*. was not only of first-rate importance m relation to the work of the iNajd M s sion during the period under report, but deserves very serious co^erat o i , i „i xj i\r t pit the future of tne Arab When I arrived at Eiyadh in December, 1917, it became immediately evident that Ibn Saud was actuated by consuming jealousy of the Sharit and genuine apprehension in respect of the latter’s unveiled pretension tn be con sidered the overlord, if not the actual ruler, of all Arab countries by vir ue of his position as de facto supreme spiritual head of Sunni Islam. Concrete expression had been given to his claims in this direction by the Sharit s assumption of the title of “ King of the Arab countries (Malik Diyar al Arab). Ibn Saud made no secret of his suspicion that the assumption of this title rested on some secret understanding with H.M.’s Government, of his unwillingness to accept the position involved in such a claim and of his anxiety lest H.M.’s Government’s commitments towards himself, as expressed in the treaty signed by Sir P. Cox in 1916, should be prejudicially affected by their arrangements with the King. I made haste to assure Ibn Saud that H.M.’s Government had no intention whatever of departing in any w^ay from their treaty obligations towards himself and that the Sharif’s assumption of the title in question was unauthorised so far as H.M.’s Government was con cerned. The fact that I was again able to reassure Ibn Saud on these points on my return from Egypt, where I had had ample opportunity of discussing the matter, militated largely in disposing him to accept with resignation the modification of H.M.’s Government’s military proposals regarding which I had orders to inform him. During the conversations with the Sharif, wdiich took place at Jidda in January, 1918, I was impressed by the fact thqt Ibn Saud’s jealousy and dis trust of the Sharif was only equalled by the latter’s uncompromising attitude towards Ibn Saud whom he regarded as the chief obstacle to the realization of his own ambition of supremacy in all Arabia. This in effect he was and is and always will be, but it is not without interest to speculate whether it would not have been possible in the earlier stages of the war for the Sharif to obtain at any rate a substantial recognition of his title by Ibn Saud by the adoption of a more conciliatory policy. Tbn Saud was always in need of financial and material assistance, in return for which it is not inconceivable that he would have been ready to place his own resources at the disposal of the Sharif for the prosecution of his operations against the common enemy, as he did or tried to do later with us during the period of the Mission’s activities; the Sharif, however, pursued the policy of keeping Ibn Saud bare of resources and undermining his power by supplying arms and money to tribesmen of Najd as a bribe to induce them to desert their allegiance to Ibn Saud. By this action he roused the jealousy and earned the undying hate of Ibn Saud, while at the same time adding enormously to his strength by arming people, who, once supplied and equip” ped, would naturally turn to Ibn Saud for further guidance. Again Ibn Saud, who had spent the whole period of his reign in con solidating his authority in his own territories and had obtained from H.M.’s Government recognition of his integrity and absolute independence within those limits subject to subsequent delimitation of frontiers, was wise enough to recognize that he was not and could never be strong enough under modern conditions to extend his frontiers and had set himself to establish his rule firmly on the basis of the Wahhabi system within limits already sufficiently wide. The Sharif affected to find in this policy of consolidation a menace to the security of his own position—in reality it was no more at the worst than a safeguard against the menace to Wahhabi integrity involved in his own pretensions—and, instead of setting to wmrk to kill the Wahhabi revival by kindness, he proceeded to fan the fanaticism of the people of Hajd by the per secution of Wahhabi elements within his reach—cases in point are the Khurma episode, the exercise of tyranny towards Najdis settled in the Hijaz and the closing of the Hijaz markets to Najd commerce. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the Sharif, in spite of the great advantages he has enjoyed in virtue of his spiritual position and of the re sources placed at his disposal by a Power disposed in every way to assist him in the realisation of the ideal of Arab Unity, has, in the conduct of his rela tions with his “ nearest nowerful neighbour ”, displayed a regrettable ab sence of that tact and address, which are the first attributes of'royalty.

Cox’ views, I consider it necessary to state, Ibn Sand, while admitting that the Sharif’s claims to be Calif of Sunni ls ani is as good as if not better than, that of anyone else including the Sultan ^ Turkey m virtue of his direct descent from the Prophet,—as a matter of fact, I doubt it lie would now, in view of what has happened during the past year, even c 0 ™ himself to this admission,—regards Sunni Islam itself as a P e ™gon o true doctrines of Muhammad, which are represented only by the Hanbali or Wahhabi school, and, while raising no objection to the_Sharif or anybody else becoming Calif, would, on no account, admit his spiritual suzerainty over himself and his people. . , . . Unless by the use of force, it seems to me as certain as anything human, that the Sharif will never attain to sovereignty or suzerainty over INajd I have indicated above how the adoption of a different policy by him might have changed the history of that country in relation to himself, and I have, perhaps, said enough to shew that the last hope of Arab unity disappeared with the first Sharifian attack on Khurma, if not before. In any case, I understand that the ideal of Arab unity under a single ruler, which came into prominence in the early stages of the negotiations with the Sharif, has definitely been abandoned by all serious students of the problem. Nevertheless, the necessity of finding some solution for the Arab problem remains—that is to say, if we are not definitely prepared to leave Arabia to its own devices with the prospect of continual strife and bloodshed—and recent correspondence indicates the revival of the old ideal in a modified form, embo died in the formula “ Priority of King Husain without prejudice to the ter ritorial rights of other Arabian Chiefs ”, which occurs in a telegram of the High Commissioner, dated the 12th August, 1918. I am not sure whether this policy is intended to be synonymous with what is called the “ suzerain policy ” by the High Commissioner in a letter, written in May, with which a long note by Colonel C. E. Wilson, British Agent at Jidda, was forwarded for the consideration of H.M.’s Government, in which the idea of establishing King Husain as the suzerain of all Arab potentates and of educating the latter up to the acceptance of such a scheme was developed in detail. The ideals of priority and suzerainty amount in effect to the same thing. Whatever happens, there can be no doubt that King Husain, by reason of his activities during the war, of the territories which presumably he will directly control, of the greater resources at his disposal and of his world-position in spiritual matters, will always be the most important unit in the Arab world. It is obvious, however, that something more than this is intended by the High Commissioner, as it is without doubt desired by King Husain—namely, that, by political or other pressure, his general suzerainty should be imposed upon all other potentates, whom we are in a position to influence. I confess I regard this ideal as entirely Utopian—however desirable it may be from the point of view of King Husain and H.M.’s Government—and Mr. Bury’s dictum, already quoted, should be sufficient warning against any attempt to force a solution of the problem on Arabia, if only, lest we raise up &gt; so great a volume of opposition to the Sharif himself, that his position will become untenable and the British Government find itself called upon to inter vene to keep the peace—even to safeguard Mecca. The Sharif has only himself to thank for the bitterness, which exists between himself and Ibn Saud. His attacks on Khurma will long rankle in the breasts of the people of Najd as an example of his methods of conciliation. Ibn Saud, recognizing his own interest in preserving friendly relations with the Sharif on account of his special position in our favour, has long withheld his hand in spite of provocation, he has even held out the olive branch in the shape of a friendly letter written, at my suggestion, against his better judg ment, but, in the end, more or less spontaneously. That letter was returned unopened, the messenger himself was treated with ignominy and even threat ened, and the King delivered himself of strongly worded uncomplimentary remarks about Ibn Saud. . In the face of this behaviour on the part of the Sharif, it seems to me idle to pretend that he has the slightest desire for the maintenance of even a semblance of friendly relations with Ibn Saud. A more public and gallino- insult it would be difficult to conceive. The prospect of Ibn Saud willingly accepting the suzerainty of the King or acknowledging his superior position m any way may be left to the imagination. Eor these reasons, I regard even the modified ideal of the “ suzerain policy ” as incapable of achievement, and the possible further alternative -of a suzerain power for all Arab lands except Najd I dismiss as being likelyprmo facie to present precisely similar difficulties. Ibn Eashid, for all the efiorts of the Sharif and his sons to placate him during the last few months I regard as more likely to join Ibn Sand for mutual protection aoainst the ambitions of the Sharif than to accept the latter’s overlordship; Maskat Bahrain and the States of the Trucial Coast are little likely of their own volition to merge their independence m an United Arabia; the Idrisi and the Imam have nothing to gain by adherence to the Sharif ;_to go further afield there is, as far as my personal experience goes, little ground for supposing by^orce amfwith ^SScZ^. t0 Sharifi “ ^lordshipZce”! nature and contain no germ oft cotsStTvttZct^/Z 1 ontytay tltfth 6 interests of the various Arab States, which goto the composSon oTthc ISb world, are as diverse as those of the various provinces and divisions of India and are as incapable as they of being welded into a homogeneous uolitilaT entity, except under the influence of a strong foreign domination capable fnterTsls.

Colonel Hamilton on his journey to Riyadh in October, 1917, had occa sion to pass within a day s journey of Artawiya, one of the centres of t\ie new Wahhabi movement associated with the name of the Akhwan brotherhood He was impressed with what he he'ard regarding the tenets of this fanatical sect and, without enquiry, accepted as probably correct a local estimate, which gave the town a population of 35,000 souls. A little reflection would I am CO vr mC A d ’ i\ ave , deterr . ed Colonel Hamilton from reporting what he had heard without further investigation, and it is not improbable that he did not expect his report to be taken seriously. In the first place it was prirna facie improb able that a town, twice as big as the biggest town in Central Arabia, could have- sprung up m the space of a few years; in the second place—and this point is to- my mmd conclusive—native estimates of population are notoriously unreliable. Doughty s plan of reducing all such estimates by 90 per cent, might have been of/p 117 m thl f- £ aS -f;, 1 - Saw the to . wn ’ from a safe distance, in October, 1918, and I am satisfied that its population cannot exceed from 10 000 to 1^,U00 souls. ’ Be that as it may, I found, on my arrival at Jidda and Cairo, that Colonel Hamilton s report had obtained official publicity and a disturbing amount of credence, causing no little alarm and predisposing the authorities, m charge of Arab affairs to attach more importance, than was perhaps war ranted by the facts, to reports emanating from prejudiced sources regarding the growth and objects of the Wahhabi revival. A report, written by Lieut.- uolonel 1. L Lawrence and purporting to give the views of Sharif Faisal, appeared m the Amfe Bulletin (No. 74 of 1917); Sharif Abdulla’s views, in due- course, received prominence in the same vehicle, and I felt that the issue was oemg it it had not already been—prejudged on totally insufficient data. I deprecated the attaching of too much importance to the views of obviously prejudiced individuals and did my best to discount the serious view that was Deing taken of the situation in high quarters, but Sharifian circles made the ’ ° S ,?• , i e imaginary menace and represented the WAhhabi revival as immediately threatening the peace and security of Arabia.—- 30 A solitary incident—the only instance in the course of 12 months so far as I am aware, of the active ebullition of the dreaded militant Wahhabi move- ment—occurred, about this time, to lend colour to the stories circulated by the King's sons. A party of non-Wahhabi Ataiba tribesmen, including' a Shaikh, had come into conflict with the Akhwan of Ghat Ghat, whither they had repaired apparently to raid or rob, and had paid for their temerity ■ with their lives. The injured relatives rushed to the Sharif for redress and the latter drew alarming pictures of the ubiquity of Wahhabi propagandists and the urgency of checking the movement in its initial stages. Ibn Saud was accused of fostering the movement for the furtherance of his own political ambitions. _ _ •_ Suffice it to say that, from this time onwards, the fear of a Wahhabi rising played no small part in disposing H.M.’s Government to regard unfavourably any proposal likely to increase the military strength of Ibn Saud. The crisis created j&gt;y the Sharif’s attacks on the Wahhabi tribesmen of Khurma and the growing possibility of an open rupture between Ibn Saud and the King, which clouded the latter part of the period under report, confirmed Government in their reluctance to arm the former, though the necessity of keeping his atten tion distracted from Sharifian affairs by active employment against the enemy was recognised. Subsequent study of the situation in Central Arabia tended to confirm me in my view that the Wahhabi peril, as such, was the fiction of prejudiced Piinds; I became convinced that Ibn Saud had the movement under perfect control. At the same time, it became increasingly apparent that the most alarming factor of the situation was the Sharif’s apparent determination to provoke Ibn Saud to set the forces of Wahhabism in motion against himself, cither to convince H.M.’s Government of the justice of his warning or, at the worst, to force Government to choose between himself and Ibn Saud—a dilemma, which, obviously, could only be resolved in one direction. This fact has not perhaps been sufficiently recognised—the Sharif’s persistence in the affair of Khurma, unimportant as it was in itself, can have had no other object than to provoke Ibn Saud into open hostility. This was patent to Ibn Saud, who was not blind to the inevitable consequences of action by himself to asseit his lights by force, and his determination to avoid being drawm into conflict on a matter, on which, on its merits, he had no strong' feelings, was equalled only by the difficulty he experienced in persuading his subjects to be patient. Fortunately for him, the people of Khurma were well able to look after themselves.; their defeat by the forces of the Sharif would certainly nave precipitated a conflict. ’ Two great difficulties have, from time immemorial, beset the path of those who have sought to rule Arabia—the nomadic habits of its tribesmen and the lack of a common rallying point. To a certain extent, the house of Kaslnd has been able to triumph over these difficulties by reason of the pecu liar constitution of the Shammar tribe, whose solidarity is emphasised bv the possession of a common capital and a ruler of their own blood. It has how ever, been otherwise with the house of Saud—a line of foreign rulers residing m a centre of their own creation and ruling a confederation of tribes neve? unready to throw oft their allegiance m the event of its becoming inconvenient. &lt; &amp; tl.P rWb C of vJ 31 ’! 8 ’ if n We r, Ca J. them ’ of the decades which followed the death of 1 aisal, aptly exemplify this point, and the present ruler of Kajd JmnriTn S f«?&gt; ne + r i COme u^ 11 ® ° f ^^dh, than he found himself called f A Ce , th ! sam e difficulty pretenders of his own house not only raising e standard of revolt against him but receiving strong support among the tribes and townships of Kajd. Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud proved himself how ever, to be a man of no mean mould,-the first years of his reign were spent m expelling the foreign invaders from his furthest frontiers then followed a period, during which he had to face the claims of rival candidates for the throne, then a short sharp successful effort to extend his frontier at the expense of the Ottoman Empire; finally followed the period of reconstruction which though retarded by the war, has been steadily pursued Now as Tlb’^siiiK ^ ^ &amp; ll0m0geneous P° litic al entity acknowledging the rule , } n A t. 0 ' . work at the task of consolidation, by which he was con- fronted, Abdul Aziz cannot have failed to be impressed by two models from the history of Central Arabia. Muhammad Ibn Rashid had owed Ms stoenoth to the peculiar characteristics, which made the Shammar what they have been and are—a Badawm tribe based on a Badawin city,—while his own great ancestor, Saud Ibn Saud, had carried his conquering arms to the farfhest corners of Arabia by reason of the judicious combination of religion and policy, to which he owed his power. Ibn Saud followed neither the one model nor the other in its entirety- lie set to work to combine the two and the result was the Akhwan movement whose essential characteristics are as follows : — ’ (1) it was restricted to the Badawin, who, though nominally for the most part, adherents of the Hanbali or, as they came later to be called, the t32 Khurma holds its own, as there seems good reason to believe it will, there is- little danger of a far-reaching extension of Wahhabi activities, but I am con vinced that the defeat of Khalid Ibn Luwai will be a signal for the storm. 15. The Khurma Episode. When I passed through the little village of Khurma, situated m the lower reaches of the Wadi Subai, in December, 1917, on my way to Taif, I became aware of the existence of trouble, but the manoeuvnngs of the bubai and Buqum tribes had little in them to indicate that a storm was brewing in that quarter which was destined to form, as it were, the Leit-motiv of Central Arabian politics. The circumstances that the Buqum were acting under the command of the Amir of Turaba, official representative of the King of the Hijaz, alone differentiated the operations I saw from the eternal outridmgs of Ataiba, Harb and Qahtan in the vast steppe country of the west. According to such information as I was able to collect m Central Arabia, Khurma, having, like the rest of Arabia, formed part of the great Wahhabi Empire and having received from Saud himself dispensation from the obliga tion to pay taxes to the Central treasury, had settled down under its Ashraf headmen, who exercised a time-honoured overlordship over the Subai owners and negro cultivators of the palm groves of the village, to the enjoyment of practical autonomy under the vague suzerainty of Najd. At a later period,, it passed under the similarly vague suzerainty of Turkey, and Ottoman author ity was, doubtless, exercised, on behalf of the Sultan, by his representative, the Sharif of Mecca. During the last decades of the 19th Century, however, when the whole of Najd acknowledged the sway of Ibn Rashid, there appears, to be reason for believing that Muhammad Ibn Rashid extorted from the Turk ish authorities a substantial recognition of his authority and the acceptance of the line of Wadi Aqiq as the boundary between his own territories and the area of elective Turkish domination, namely, the Hijaz. By this arrangement Khurma must have been included by implication in the territories of Ibn Rashid, on whose expulsion from Najd, at the beginning of the present cen tury, Ibn Saud resumed sway over the territories of his ancestors. The important facts of the case are, firstly, that, so far as I have been able to ascertain, Khurma was always in the past too insignificant, either to form a bone of contention between the authorities concerned or to be men tioned specifically in any public agreement; secondly, that it always remained in enjoyment of virtual autonomy and independence; and, lastly, that it w T as, if anything, naturally dependent on Najd in virtue of its allegiance to the Wahhabi faith. With that allegiance no attempt appears ever to have been made to interfere, and I see no reason for questioning the correctness of Ibn Saud’s statement that Shara Law has always been administered at Khurma for the benefit of its inhabitants by ecclesiastical officials of the Wahhabi persuasion, of whom the Qadhi, actually in office at the present time, suc ceeded his father, who, in turn, owed his appointment to Faisal Ibn Saud at least 50 years ago. The fans et origo mali —and this we have on the authority of certain letters; written by Sharif Abdulla himself to the tribal leaders of the Subai—was an attempt on the part of the Sharif in the Summer of 1917 to impose an orthodox Qadhi on the people of Khurma in place of the Wahhabi official, who had ministered to them for so long or, in other words, to interfere with the religious-, liberty of the community. /This attempt - was strongly resented and stoutly opposed by the people of Khurma, led by Sharif Khalid Ibn Luwai, their Amir; the newly appointed Qadhi was refused admission to his See and the forces of the Sharif were set in motion to enforce submission to his orders by the rebellious community. The Sharif, imputing to Ibn Saud certain unspecified and certainly imaginary activities calculated to undermine his authority in the Khurma area, announced to the British Authorities his intention of sending troops to reduce the Subai and the drama began on or about the 1st June, 1918, with an attack on the Subai encampment, which resulted in the defeat of the Sharifian forces with the loss of two guns and two automatic rifles. Ibn Luwai announced his victory to Ibn Saud in the customary Badawin way and I, at Riyadh, was in an excellent position to appreciate the effect of the ostentatious announcement of the victory of the true faith over the infidel on the dour spirits of the fanatical Wahhabis, seared by the painful rigours of a mid-summer Ramdhan. The messengers from Khurma had passed, on their way, through the important Wahhabi settlement of Ghat Ghat, whose inhabitants responded without delay to the call for assistance by despatching a strong contingent towards the scene of action. Riyadh clamoured for war with the Sharif and, so far as I was in a position to judge, its clamour secured the important advocacy of the Imam Abdul Rahman himself and of the Wahhabi high priest ; but Ibn Saud, making no secret of the seriousness of the situation in his con versations with me, resisted the pressure brought to bear on him, recalled the f ( ■ t }1^1 - 34 the ability of Ibn Luwai to hold bis own single-handed, took the news calmly and, without losing so good an opportunity of protesting once more agains the undisguised and active hostility of the Sharif made it clear that he would now be too busy with his own operations against Hail to be able to give atten tion to other matters. Such wms the position, when war against Turkey came to an abrupt con clusion relieving the British Government of all immediate anxiety in regard to the development of the Central Arabian situation. As noted m the last section Sharif Shakir is still maintaining his threat against Khurma, but the final denouement of the episode, whatever it may be and with whatever con sequences to the peace of Arabia, falls beyond the scope of this report. Sufficient has been said to show that the Khurma affair constituted in realitv a test case for the decision of the Sharif’s claim to jurisdiction over Naid or no small part of it. The British Government is committed by treaty to delimit the frontiers of the territory, over which Ibn Saud is recognised as independent ruler. This problem must receive the attention of H.M. s Gov ernment in the postwar period of reconstruction, now imminent, and it will not be out of place to consider briefly some of the main points of the problem and to suggest, at any rate, the lines, on which it may be approached. The problem, reduced to its simplest form, is that, while Ibn Saud claims absolute independence and integrity in the whole of Najd, the Sharif P u * forward pretensions of overlordship over the whole of the Ataiba and Harb tribes and the western section of the Subai. One has only to take cognisance of the fact that the Ataiba occupy the Naid highlands and the western steppe from the line of the Dalqan and Sirr Nafudhs to well within the line of the Hijaz mountains; that the Harb extend from the confines of the Batin to Madina over the whole desert of upper Qasim and that the western section of the Subai marches with the Buqum on the line of the Shaib Shaba on the west and with the Ataiba along Wadi Naim on the east; to realise that, in effect, the Sharif claims sovereignty over Central Arabia westward of a line drawn from lhamami, at the west end of the Batin, alono- the Wadi Rima and thence roughly southward along the eastern boun- d a ry of the Mudhib and Sirr districts to the Nafudh Sirra, south of the Najd Highlands, and so westward to the neighbourhood of Wadi Ranya. Thus the whole of the Qasim and Sirr provinces are claimed by the Sharif, whose eastern frontier would almost touch the frontier of Kuwait territory. Such a claim would, it is needless to say, be resolutely contested by Ibn Saud, who claims jurisdiction over the whole of Najd and over such parts of the tribes abovementioned as reside therein. He rejects the possibility of a solution on tribal lines and is supported in this contention by history, which, so far as I know, has never been able to record the solidarity of the Ataiba and Harb tribes in allegiance to a single ruler. In any case, it is obvious that any claim on the part of the Sharif, involv ing his acquisition of the Qasim and Sirr, is absurd on the face of it, and that fact alone makes the solution of the problem on a tribal basis impossible. The only alternative solution is a territorial boundary and the recognition of the authority of each ruler over all tribes and individuals residing on his side of such a frontier. To find such a boundary is no easy task, but not so difficult as it may appear, as Central Arabia has the advantage of having well marked physical features, extending from north to south between the east and west line of the Nafudh Sirra, which shuts off the Wadi Hawasir region, and the boundaries of Jabal Shammar. The boundary line, above referred to, may be rejected as impracticable; its southern section along the Nafudh Dalqan, continued north wards along the western boundary of Sirr and the Qasim, is equally imprac ticable, in that it places the whole of the true Najd Highlands, which are and have always been under the effective rule of Ibn Saud, within the jurisdiction of the Sharif. The next possible line is the Wadi Naim, running roughly due south from Sija; beyond that westward is the line of the Shaib Shaba; beyond that again is the line of the Wadi Aqiq. Between these three lines—and there seem to me no other possible ones— the eventual decision must rest; the last though it enjoys a certain degree of historical sanction may be rejected as giving Ibn Saud more than he claims; the first is only open to the objections, firstly, that it places the western section of the Subai tribes and its capital Khurma within the jurisdiction of the Sharif and thus cuts across the doctrine of the right of self-determination of weak communities, which is, to say the least, entitled to respect and, secondly, that it leaves a Wahhabi island in an orthodox sphere and thus keeps open the door of religious friction in Arabia; the middle alternative is to my mind the one best suited to the requirements of local conditions, the one most accept able to the people most vitally concerned, the one that comes nearest to provid ing an exact line of demarcation between the hitherto vague geographical terms Najd and Hijaz, and the only one which follows a recognised tribal boundary for a considerable part of its length. Subject to minor modifications of detail its exact course would be along the Hamdh-Rima watershed in the4 ^ 35 Harrat Eliaibar to Hanakiya {wbicli would it +n rvir&gt; f meeting place of the boundaries of The Hijaz Na d ?ah’ n »u/ thence straight across the steppe to Marran J thpnp^fl’ ,'i abal . a ^ d Shammar), sftstteaas-jsa zst the line would follow the Wadf^Turab^ 3 Whhw^^^uraba 1 to^ the line would run east or west nf tlio PonTm +» 4 . • Izom 4 ural:,a to -Ijisha by 1 circumstances . 011 t0 eSPreSS “ -uldTet?* JbeSed 1 expJstrt^ttit'tw^^ikeriut^ respective spheres of jurisdiction of the sLrif and lln sLdl^Tn^ 6 the com’s^'of ^the^ar^ 11 ^!^ wishes^^he wopt toT'ffh* d'b “ and the desirability of leaving no loophole for the occurrence o^religlousTrTc 11 rhhtieifrd^rr^ but subordinate, adjusts P 6 ° aSe WOuld serve as ™P”tent, abstr^^merits a o e f'thTdlfrflfl iS ad f, ed S e reflesio11 that - ''hatever the aostract merits of the dispute between the Sharif and Ibn Saud over their boundaries may be, the actions of the Sharif durino- the past year have so alienated the sympathies of the people of Khurma that they will nh submit to his rule m any circumstances whateyer, the delicacy of the task confronting H.M. s Government m the near future can be readily imagined On the othe? hand, if they decline the heavy responsibility of deciding and enforcing their 16.

I t 11 Saud i Untl1 matters became really acute between the latter and the Sharif over the Khurma affair, when, in September, 1918, he took the opportunity of writing, ostensibly to give Ibn Saud the somewhat a e news of the demise of the late Sultan but, more particularly, to con- g r a tulate him on the victories of the Akhwan of Khurma over the Sharifian expeditions {md, incidentally, to offer to supply him with anything he might 1? t m. ma n er arms ’ ammunition and funds to prosecute a campaign a amst the Sharif These letters, also, Ibn Saud made over to me in original ana, tnough the offer of arms, etc., came at a critical moment, when his rela- ns wi the Sharif are extremely strained and H.M.’s Government had ^ U/v (fcK iu^&amp;i36 4 f expressed their inability to supply arms for the Hail campaign it is to Ibm Sand’s credit that he resisted the temptation to reply to lakhn 1 asiia. ^ _ Another Turkish communication received in August he treated with simi lar contempt—a letter signed by four leading chiefs of the Asir tribes, but obviously, from its style and contents, dictated by Muhiyuddm Beg, the Turkish Commandant and Mutasarrif in Asir, m which Ibn Saud was re minded of the benefits accruing to the province of Asir from Turkish rule and was called upon to join the signatories in defence of the true faitn. So much for such correspondence as is known to have been addressed to Ibn Saud by or on behalf of the Turkish authorities. In June a report, emanating from Aden, indicated, apparently on good authority, that Ibn Saud and the Turks had concluded arrangements, whereby certain officers were to be allowed to pass down to Yaman to set the finances of the troops serving there in order, but at no time did this report seem to me to be anything but the fiction of some prejudiced brain. In any case, it was intrinsically improbable on the face of it, and I never heard any more of the results of the alleged arrangement. The only occasion, on which, so far as I know, Turkish Officers attempted:, to pass through Najd, occurred in April, when, on my return to Riyadh, Ibn Saud informed me that, having received information of the passage of a Dar- wish through Riyadh, he had stopped and arrested the man, who proved to be a certain Qol-Agasi Qudsi Efiendi, an Officer of the Yaman forces, endeavouring ■ to make his way from Sanaa and Ibha via Riyadh to Medina and Constanti nople with a considerable sum (£ T341) in Turkish notes and a number of private letters, which contained little of interest and importance beyond the information that another officer had left Ibha some three weeks or so ahead of Qudsi Effendi bound for the same destination. Whether that officer got through or perished on the journey it is impossible to say, but he was not in tercepted bv Ibn Saud. As regards Qudsi Effendi, who remained in custody at Riyadh to the end of the period under report, I expressed a desire to see him on my return from Wadi Dawasir, with a view to arranging for his despatch to the coast for internment by the British authorities. My desire to visit him being com municated to him, he made it quite clear that, though he could not refuse to see me, if Ibn Saud insisted on his doing so, his disgust for and hatred of infi dels was such, that he would rather be. spared the ordeal. In these circum stances I respected his wishes and never saw him, though, hearing from another source that he was in custody in circumstances of great hardship and discom fort, I begged Ibn Saud to improve the conditions of his imprisonment. Qol Agasi Qudsi Effendi, for all his unreasoning fanaticism, had reason to be- grateful to an infidel for a very substantial alleviation of the miserable condi tions, under which he lived in the dungeons of the Riyadh fort for nearly two months. 17. Arms in Najd. In view of the often-repeated reluctance of H.M.’s Government to supply Ibn Saud with arms and the High Commissioner’s insistence on the inadvis ability of strengthening the Wahhabi forces on account of the possible deve lopment of a Wahhabi menace, it is important to note that, while Government’s policy in this matter had the effect of alienating, to a certain extent, the sym pathies of Ibn Saud, it failed of its main object owing to the Sharif’s lavish distribution of arms and ammunition among irresponsible elements of the population of Yajd in the mistaken belief that he was thereby securing their allegiance. To this may be added the illicit traffic in arms and ammunition, out of which, there seems little doubt, certain Sharifian officials, responsible for the custody of military equipment, made considerable profits. The traffic in arms and ammunition was carried on in Yajd on a wholesale scale, and cases came to my notice of the transit thereof through Yajd to the Persian Gulf coast. Ibn Saud was constrained to forbid the export of ammu nition from his territories and to take steps to purchase such surplus stocks, as were available, for his own use, with the result that, during the last months of the period under report, he had bought up considerably in excess of 300,000i rounds, while I estimated that at least an equal quantity, in the aggregate, was held by individuals. Ibn Saud being content to leave rifles in the posses sion of those who had them, knowing that they would always be available for his service, it was not possible to procure even the roughest estimate of the number received from Sharifian sources, but it is known that Yajd volunteers were freely supplied with arms and regularly came away with the equipments; so secured—frequently as deserters. In these circumstances it may be assumed that in one way or another Najd secured large quantities of arms, possibly not far short of 5,000, if we assume a rough percentage of one rifle to 100 rounds of ammunition brought away. The result of the Sharif’s policy and, indeed, of our own was to weaken. Ibn Saud in relation to his own subjects and leave him in a worse position to control the Wahhabi movement than before, while, at the same time, greatly increasing the strength of the tribes. .0 I38 Prophet at Madina is anathema and hotly inveiglied against; the reverence of other Sunni saints and their tombs, of which an instance is the pilgrimage to the tomb of Abdulla ibn Abbas at Taif, largely resorted to by women dis appointed of offspring, is regarded as an act of idolatry; while Ibn Sand never tires of inveighing against the Sharif for permitting the laxity ot morals, which makes Mecca itself a byword. In 1917 Ibn Sand arranged a ceremonious pilgrimage on a large scale from Najd, in which rode his father and his brother, Muhammad. Ihe former’s return on account of illness before he reached Mecca was, without any reason whatever, interpreted in Sharifian circles as being indicative of fear or hatred, while the experiences of Muhammad and his fellow-pilgrims and the growing delicacy of the political situation decided Ibn Saud to allow no official pilgrimage from Najd during the year under report. I ha\m no reason to credit reports emanating from Mecca to the effect that Ibn Saud had threatened to visit disobedience in this matter with dire penalties—his orders were in themselves sufficient; while he did all that was reasonably possible to facilitate the journey of the Kuwait pilgrimage, -which passed through Buraida, when I was there at the end of August. On the whole, I am of opinion that Ibn Sand’s decision to send no pil grimage from Najd this year was a wise precaution against trouble; the Sharif’s actions and public pronouncements at this period were, at any rate, not calculated to make a Najd pilgrimage free of serious risk of disturbance. 19. Location of Political Agent in Najd. The question of the permanent location of a British Agent at the Wah habi court, on which I was instructed to elicit Ibn Sand’s views, was a very delicate matter to approach, more particularly in view of Ibn Sand’s growing dissatisfaction at his treatment by H.M.’s Government, and I regret to say that I had had no reasonable opportunity to make such a proposal when my Mission terminated in circumstances which left no doubt that Ibn Saud would not consent to it unreservedly. Towards myself Ibn Saud was invariably frank and cordial; I saw him daily, often, indeed, more than once a day, and he seemed to take pleasure in giving me his views and discussing politics, history and the affairs of the world in general. Nevertheless, ut was obvious to me that my presence with him was a matter which necessitated continual explanations_to a critical and hostile audience; according to his own account, he countered the adverse com ments of the strict Wahhabi element by the explanation that my stay, though prolonged, was temporary and necessitated only by the Sharifian situation and the blockade, in regard to which he found it necessary to be in close touch with the British Government. He never allowed it to be supposed publicly that I was in any way interested in his operations against Hail. At the same time, he made it clear to me that he regarded my presence as absolutely necessary and, indeed, advantageous to him, and he never sug gested that I should go, until, in the circumstances already indicated, he informed me very frankly that if H.M.’s Government were not disposed to modify their recent policy towards him, he would not expect me to return or to be replaced. Public opinion would certainly be hostile to the permanent location of a British representative in Najd, but Ibn Saud would, I am convinced, be pre pared to run counter to the views of his subjects, if the presence of such a representative were likely to be to his own political advantage. That will depend on the line of policy decided on in due course by H.M.’s Government. In any case, if we may assume that our policy in the future will be such as to dispose Ibn Saud to agree to the permanent representative of H.M.’s Government at his court, the nature of the agency to be established will be a matter demanding serious consideration. The jealousy and exclusiveness of Najd render it, in my opinion, quite out of the question to establish an agency on the ordinary lines in vogue at the ports on the Persian Gulf coast, with all the paraphernalia of office establishments, escorts and flags. The display of alien power would be as unwelcome to the Wahhabi as the influx of alien personnel; the presence of even Muslim clerks and servants from outside would be a ground of suspicion and anxiety to Ibn Saud, calculated to dis turb the even tenour of our relations with him. For these reasons, I am convinced that, at any rate, for many years to come, H.M.’s Government should aim at making their representation at the Wahhabi court as _ unostentatious as is compatible with efficiency. The British Agent at Eiyadh must be content to live the life of the people, adopt their manner of dress and, above all, to submit to the somewhat irksome restrictions imposed on social intercourse alike by the bigotry of the people and the jealousy of their ruler. Perhaps even it would be politic in the beginning so to arrange matters that the presence of a British Officer at Eiyadh should be intermittent and not permanent, constituting a series of visits at reasonable intervals rather than continuous residence.

Precis of Relations with Ihn Sand (vide para. 2 of Report). Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud the present Hakim of Najd, may be said to have begun h^s reign m 1901, when he was proclaimed governor of Riyadh by his father Abdul Rahman. &gt; The Saud family were at that time in exile, having* been driven out of their dominions in 1891, by their hereditary foe, Ibn 19 ° 2 ’ 4, Z1Z Wlth the hel P of Mubarak Ibn Sabah, Shaikh ?Qn?T a t t ’J eC °T ered ! n f raid wllich lle led ^ Person, and by 1906 he had so far re-established the old supremacy of the Saud as to carry hostilities to the gates of Hail. During the years succeeding his return to Riyadh he acted m close alliance with the Shaikh of Kuwait, who had everv reason for desiring the curtailing of Rashid influence. For the Rashid were allies, and m a remote acceptation of the term, vassals of the Ottoman empire fuibsidised and backed by Constantinople, and they represented in Arabia the lurkish policy of centralisation which the Shaikh was covertly resisting in his own territories. His geographical position on the shores of the Persian i j i, j d P . ced l 11111 m relations with the British Government; since 1899 we had had a friendly understanding with him and had promised to support him against Ottoman aggression. But the existence of this connection made us unwilling to see him drawn into the confused and uncertain feuds of the interior and acting on the principle laid down in 1897 that we were “ not disposed to interfere more than was necessary for the maintenance of general peane m the Persian Gulf ”, we had discouraged him from embroiling himself in Central Arabian affairs. Ibn Sand, in spite of liis growing* importance, was °utsi de the limits of our interest, thus appointed, and it was not until 1911 that special attention was drawn to him in our official reports. In that year Captain Shakespear, the PoHtical Agent at Kuwait, while on tour, met him by chance in the desert and was hospitably entertained in his camp. ’ Ibn Saud expressed to him a desire to be received into a recognised relationship- with Great Britain; he referred to Colonel Pellv’s visit to Rivadh in 1865 and to the overtures made to us by his father, Abdul Rahman, in 1904 when.a Bri- tish Agent was first appointed to Kuwait. He spoke in strong terms of the hatred which the Arabs entertained for the Turks and of his ow T n resentment of their occupation of the Hasa, a province which he was particularlv anxious to- legam, not only because it formed part of his ancestral dominions, but also because it would give him access to the s'ea and control over the tribes from Riyadh to the coast. He regarded with grave apprehension the aggressive policy of the new regime in Turkey and would welcome, if he recovered the Hasa, a British Agent in one of his ports, and he added that our trade w*ould benefit from the increased security wdiich he would maintain on the caravan routes. Captain Shakespear could make no other rejoinder' than that the British Government confined its interests to the coast and had never challenged Turkish claims to the ordering of affairs in Central Arabia, with which we had no concern; that we were moreover on amicable terms with Turkey and should be averse from anything in the nature of intrigue against the Ottoman Government, but in his comments on the report of this interview Sir Percy Cox pointed out that as the Porte seemed disposed to be intractable m the adjustment of matters relating to British interests in the- •+ -u J e C0Illd ^ ot afford to i^npre Ibn Sand’s attitude. His personal author ity had greatly increased, and it would be well to entertain cordial if distant relations with him. The Foreign Office, however, decided that it was im possible at that time to swerve from our policy of strict non-interference. Iwo years later Ibn Saud, wuthout the assistance which he had tried to obtain from us, though he was credited throughout Arabia with having secured it, overran the Hasa, ejected without difficulty the small Turkish garrisons and established himself on the coast at Qatif and Ojair. Captain Shakespear, on his return to England in June, 1914, from a long projected journey across Arabia, in the course of which he had visited Riyadh, bore witness to the strong personal domination which Ibn Sand’s vigorous and commanding personality had established, and from other reports it was clear that he was regarded beyond his own frontiers as the coming man. He proved more than a match for the ineffective eff orts of the Turks to retake the Hasa; they resorted to- diplomacy and opened negotiations with him through Saiyid Talib. of Basrah. Early in May TaPat Beg had formulated in private conversation at the British Embassy the expectations of the Ottoman Government in terms which seemed to his hearers little consonant with actual conditions. He proposed to estab lish a strictly delimited frontier between Ibn Saud and Ibn Rashid, place repre sentatives of the Sultan at Riyadh and at Hail, and rely upon the guile of44 these officials to control without the aid of force the actions of the two Amirs. As for the Hasa, Ibn Sand would fee appointed Mutasarnf °f ^ but the collection of the customs would remain m lurhish hands and lurk garrisons would be replaced in the ports. Nothing was more certain than that Ibn Sand’s appearance on the coast must ultimately bring him into direct contact with ourselves whether we welcomed it or'sought to avoid it; and this anxiety underlay and possibly accelerated the action of the Porte. But at the moment Turkish fears were groundless. We were concerned wholly with the conclusion of prolonged negotiations with Constantinople touching interests in Mesopotamia and the Gulf which were of vital importance, and were less inclined, it possible, tiian before for Arabian adventure. We made a friendly offer of mediation whic was refused, and when, in April, 1914, the Amir met the Lntish Agent, Colonel Grey, outside Kuwait, he was given to understand that we had re cently concluded a comprehensive agreement with Turkey and could hold out to him no hope of support. Ibn Sand was thrown back on his own resources, but these were considerable, and tlie secret treaty which was signed m May bv himself and the Wali of Basrah, fell short of TaBat Beg’s anticipations. He accepted the title of Wali and Military Commandant of Najd which was offered to himself and his descendants as long as they should remain loyal, and engaged to fly the Turkish flag, but he was to have charge of the customs, on behalf of the Ottoman Government, raise his own levies and provide the garrisons for Qatif and Ojair. Deficiencies in the Kajd budget were to be met from the customs, and no revenue from, any local income was to be paid to Constantinople until such time as there was a surplus—an eventuality of doubtful occurrence. But while exercising in his own territories an authority which was in all but the name that of an independent ruler, his correspond ence with foreign Powders was to he conducted solely through the Porte, and in case of war he was to come to the assistance of the Sultan. What would Imve been the upshot of a treaty which so imperfectly re flected the convictions of the contracting parties can scarcely admit of doubt. The guiding trait of Ibn Sand’s character is what must be called a racial rather than a national patriotism, but this sentiment was not likely to evoke sympathetic consideration from the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress, who were blindly determined on the Ottomanization of the Arabs. As a strict Wahhabi, the new Wali of Najd looked with abhorrence on the loose religious principles of the Turks and was far from admitting their pre tensions to represent and direct Islam. He had, in conversation with Cap tain Shakespear, spoken with unexpected vehemence cn this point, saying that in his eyes the infidel was preferable to the Turk, since the latter broke the rule he professed to follow, while the former acted in accordance with his own law, and to the same listener he declared that he had accepted the terms of the agreement only because he was assured privately that even the small measure of sovereignty accorded to Turkey would never be claimed. The Kuwait treaty was put to the test by the outbreak of the European war and found wanting. The disquieting attitude adopted by Turkey on the outbreak of war be tween Germany and the Entente Powers produced a profound alteration in our policy towards the Porte. It became necessary to reckon up our assets in Arabia, and early in October Captain Shakespear, who was in England, was ordered to return to the Persian Gulf and get into touch with Ibn Saud so as to prevent if possible the outbreak of unrest in the interior, and in the event of war with Turkey to ensure that no assistance should be rendered from that quarter. Before he could reach his destination wmr had been declared. A message had been despatched to Ibn Saud informing him of Captain Shakespear’s impending visit, recognizing his position in Kajd and the Hasa and guaranteeing him against reprisals by sea or land if he would commit himself to enter the lists against Turkey. The Turks, on their side, lost no time in approaching the Amirs of Central Arabia. Their scheme, which was that Ibn Kashid should aid in the campaign against Egypt while Ibji Saud opposed the British advance in Mesopotamia, showed that they were'as un aware of the feeling towards^ them which prevailed among the Arabs as they were ignorant of the conditions of the desert, where the network of tribal feud permits no man to withdraw his forces on a distant expedition without fear of attack on his unprotected possessions. Ibn Saud, apparently in order to gain time, took advantage of his abiding enmity with Ibn Rashid and launched into open hostilities against him. In vain Enver Pasha urged him to abandon private quarrels, sent him a gift of money for the expenses of co operation with the Sultan’s armies, and ultimately entrusted Saiyid Talib with the task of bringing about a reconciliation. At this juncture Saiyid Talib was busily engaged in endeavouring through the intermediation of Shaikh Khaz/al and His Majesty’s Consul at Muhammareh to drive a bargain with the British Government providing for his adherence to us in the event of war with Turkey, but the terms which he put forward were so extravagant as to^be impossible of acceptance, and he was still hesitating over Shaikh Khaz‘al’s advice to him to abate them when the declaration of wnr left him0 45 .stranded. Then it was that he saw in his proposed deputation to Naid a providential means of escape from Basrah where his position had now become highly precarious and he left hurriedly for Ibn Saud’s camp, via Zubair MeanwhBe the Wahhabi Chief, m response to Turkish exhortation, had plead ed that he could spare no troops for the ‘Iraq till he had reduced Ibn Bashid o is rightful state of vassalage. To the British message he replied that he was unshaken m his long-standing desire for intimate relations with us But he was not unnaturally reluctant to take open part with us until he was satis^ fied that our change of front towards himself was likely to be permanent and m spite of his personal confidence in Captain Shakespear it was with some misgiving that he consented to his visit. The meetiim tool' nlacp rm December 31st at-Khufsah near Majma‘ in SudaiT X sfud spoke wift great frankness. Before compromising himself wholly with the hurts he asked that our assurances of support should be embodied'in a formal treaty the terms of which were drafted forthwith. They included a guarantee ?f complete independence on our part and an undertaking on the part of Ibn Saud that he would have no dealings with other Powers except after reference to the British Government He informed Captain Shakespear that he had been m communication with the Sharif and with the heads of the northern Anazah confederation and that they were resolved to stand together. He was holding m detention a party of four envoys sent by the Turks to urge him to join. Ibn Rashid m a against us, but after consultation with Captain Shakespear the Turkish mission was dismissed with the reply that Ibn Kashid’s forces were camped within two days of Ibn Saud and that there could now be ten qU M tl0n n f P6aCe then V 0n Januar y 17th a messenger arrived Hp a ±r ° m t le Sharif ’ s son &gt; Abdullah, who wrote that the Sharif had been called upon to proclaim the jihad and was temporising till he heard what line Ibn Saud proposed to take. Ibn Saud made an answer and hlVhte^p 0 lf a i 7an - a ^ t0 rr tlle ,^ S in j °- inillg tlle 0ttomaI i Government and had himself dismissed a Turkish deputation empty-handed. Upon the reports sent by Captain Shakespear from Ibn Saud’s camp, Sir Percy box was authorised to proceed with the negotiations for the treaty, but on January 24th battle was joined between Ibn Saud and Ibn Eashid and Laptam Shakespear, unarmed and present only as a spectator, met his death. of ?! dlsaste . r U as that he was shot dead by a Shammar iifie-buliet, but this statement is m any case based only on second-hand information, as it is undisputed that Captain Shakespear had taken up a position m a different part of the field than that where his host was located Smce then various and divergent accounts of what happened have been recited one of little more value than another, but the balance of evidence goes to show that he was first wounded in the leg and disabled, and soon afterwards villed m the charge of Ibn Eashid s cavalry which overwhelmed the flank on which he was posted In the sauve qui pent which ensued it is feared that he was either abandoned or forgotten, but the precise circumstances of Jif 1111 * 1 ! y d ® atl1 Probably never be ascertained. Ibn Saud expressed I ofound regret for the loss of one whom he regarded as a brother, and always refers to him with respect and affection. &lt;^vvays The action was indecisive: both parties claimed the victory and both were temporarily crippled and forced to retire. It was an unexpected and a somewhat disconcerting result, for Ibn Saud’s preparations had been made ? t 1 U &lt; ^ ce PG° Ilal scale and hi 8 forces were said largely to outnumber those aUi n i b °T J \ G inferi0 1 r 111 cavalry. The accounts given by the Arabs attribute his defeat to the treachery of the Ajman. Ibn Saud’s personal b ? y0 ? d v qUeS -I 0n ’ but lle * ot uncoinm only falls short as a tactician, and Mubarak of Kuwait pronounced him to be a poor leader in battle. But if he had not dealt Ibn Eashid a crushing blow, he had at least put him out alK J P reve nted him from joining the Turks, as he unquestionably would have done. The intervention of Ibn Eashid in the early part of the Mesopotamian campaign might have added considerably to our difficulties. Nevertheless Captain Shakespear s death was a heavy price to pay for the advantage of immobilizing him. F J The two chiefs held apart without further hostilities till the summer when an agreement, dated June 10th, was concluded between them. Ibn Eashid lecognised Ibn Saud s claims, except that of overlordship which he could scaicely be expected to acknowledge, and undertook not to play a treacherous game towards the Turkish Government but to incline towards whichever Gov ernment was m alliance with Ibn Saud. He confined his own jurisdiction ij i an T it 8 vR^^ 8 and Gi 0 Shammar tribes, while Ibn Saud was acknow ledged to hold all INajd from A1 Khahaf to Bawasir. A1 Khahaf is no doubt the Kahafah of Hunter’s map, a little north of latitude 27 degrees. In a tribal country the adjustment of frontiers can never be very exact, but it is clear that Ibn Eashid renounced all pretensions to the Qasim, a province whose rich oases had frequently changed hands. It is of interest to note that the tribes reckoned as subject to Ibn Saud are the Mutair, Ataibah, Harb, Ba,ni Abdullah, Ajman, Murrah, Manasir, Bani Haja, Subai, Salmi, Qahtan and JJawasir, but this catalogue must not be taken as exact, for the Mutair are46 18 i mos tly in Kuwait territory and the Ataibah and Harb come for the greater ^ art After*^ Captain ^bakespear’s ^'bt^ S ^n g that another officer should b e accredit^ t^ Abdul Latif Handily No tions should continue tbr01 jj= , . -f^ n g all(i was advised to sign a preliminary suitable officer was availa &gt; Shakespear’s draft and leave all details to agreement on the lines o P , d t ] ie new draft which had been sent be settled later He signed an( ^ re * U difi tions concerning which it seemed to him but with some important modifications co chief p olitlca l better to postpone further discussm^n ^ ^ the CO nclusion of the Officer could be arranged. 1 .^ 0 . whollv eno-a^ed with internal affairs, treaty was suspended, Ibn Sand being H is reputation His position at home at this epoch wa * against Ibn among the tribes ! iad h su ^ r d e ^ n f c ^ ed h muc h loss in material and equipments, Eashid during which he had incurred d with a dangerous rising and during the greater part of 1915 he wg^engagea ^ the ?t in the Hasa an «f Ibi Eashid, but it is doubtful whether his was instigated by l^U anq l convinced that there was no s.r.rsS* a M £;|4-‘., &lt;' WaS opiniofis^ial borne out that ^troubles t'wS''!

The discontent of the Ajman was fanned by mem- 1 nf Thn Sand’s familv who had long been at enmity with him, the Ara , SBawsf^fr., ,r r *. stss'ivsar's. the Araif refused his mediation and sought the protection of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi from whom they received some countenance when hostilities were renewed with Ibn Sand in 1915. The rebellion now assumed ^ous propor tions Ibn Saud sent for more troops from Eiyadh and asked help from Kuwait but before the arrival of either reinforcement he attacked the A;man bv night near Hofuf and met with a reverse, due partly to the cowardice of the Hofuf town levies. His brother Saud was killed and he himself wounded. For a time his fortunes were at a very low ebb. He was m want of money and arms, and for all practical purposes was besieged m Hofuf. Ibn Ixaslnd, oblivious of the agreement recently signed seized the opportunity to Ae Qasim, but his advance was easily stopped, and the arrival of a force from Kuwait under the Shaikh’s son, Salim, turned the balance m the Hasa. T \iman were routed in September, harried on their retreat northwards by the Bani Khalid and forced to take refuge in Kuwait territory where they re mained until Shaikh Mubarak’s death in December Fahad Ibn Sand was killed in the retreat: Salman made his peace with Ibn Saud at the end of the year. During the struggle we had facilitated the despatch of ammunition to Ibn Saud from Bahrain and done what we could to restrain Abu Dhabi. in October we presented Ibn Saud with 1,000 rifles and gave him a loan of £20 000. The Turks had not yet abandoned all hope of vanning him over, and in July, previous to Ibn Eashid’s raid, a Turkish emissary, Salih al Sharif al Hasni, communicated with him and proposed a meeting; but his request was refused, and on December 26th Ibn Saud met Sir Percy Cox at Qatif and the long-delayed treaty was completed and signed. Subject to certain safe guards it provided Ibn Saud with a dynastic guarantee in the dominions now in his possession and promised him the support of Great Britain in case of unprovoked aggression from foreign Powers. On his side Ibn Saud engaged to hold no correspondence with any foreign Power and to grant no concessions to foreigners, to keep open the roads to the Holy Places and to commit no aggressive act on other Shaikhs under our protection. Ibn Saud was unaware of the exceedingly confidential correspondence which we had been carrying on with the Sharif during the vintei of 1915- 1916, but the results to which it led could not leave him indifferent. _ Dela tions between the Hijaz and Najd had been dictated by conflicting sentiments. The Sharif had even more reason than Ibn Saud to fear the Turks, but he was jealous of Ibn Sand’s position as an Arab Chief, and the feeling was. reciprocated in Eiyadh. The fluctuating allegiance of the tribes is a rich source of discord in Arabia, and the absence of any defined frontiers enhances the uncertainty of claims and obligations. In 1910 the Sharif Abdullah, asserting that he acted on behalf of the Ottoman Government, marched to the borders of the Qasim for the purpose of reasserting an authority which was probably a thing of the past and must at the best have been shadowy. The tangible results of the raid do not seem to have been more than a reinsistence on the Sharif’s suzerainty over the distant sections of the Ataibah, a tribe47 which had once been under Ibn Sand but had largely seceded to the Sharif. \ i S i m n i , t f lb r ute i°. ^ e . cca f roin the Qasim villages was stipulated for by Abdullah before his withdrawal, but it is unlikely that it was ever paid hrom 191d the Sharif showed strong anti-Turkish proclivities, and before the outbreak of var he and Ibn Saud drew together. Thev were in correspond- ence wTen Ga^ptam Shakespear paid his first visit to Riyadh in the spring ° f i Januai *y 19 }*’ ^ey were acting in concert, and Ibn Saud told Captain Shakespear that m his view the Khalifate would revert to the family of the Prophet, of which the Sharif was tlffe representative, if it dropped from the hand of tlie Sultan of Turkey. In November, 1915, Abdullah reappeared in iNajd, with vhat object is not very clear. His own explanation was that he was sent on a mission to Ibn Saud, with the further purpose of collectino* dues m the Qasim and Sudair. Except for a doubtful suzerainty over wan dering sections of the Ataibah, the Sharif does not seem in Beduin estima tion to have rights in either province, his limits eastwards being somewhere between Longitude 44 degrees and Longitude 45 degrees at Sha £ arah, Duwadmi, J abal Dhurai and Jabal al Nir. Abdullah is not reported to have ad vanced much beyond Sha'arah : he collected dues from the Ataibah, subdued the small allied section of the Buraih (by origin Mutair) and returned to the liijaz : but ibn Saud, barely emerged from a perilous contest in the Hasa not unreasonably regarded the expedition as inopportune and even suspicious (these sentiments were reflected in his conversations with Sir Percy Cox in De- cember He reminded the Chief Political Officer that the Wahhabis recognised no ilhalif after the first four, and was careful to add that if the Sharif should assume the title it would make no difference to his status among other ruling Chiefs) In June of the following year the Sharif rose in open rebellion against the lurks and declared the independence of the Arabs. Ibn Saud writing m July to the Chief Political Officer, acknowledged the receipt from ™° f ofeai , al ne ^ s , 1 wltb , r ®g‘ ard to tlie Hijaz, expressed his satisfaction at jr 6 discomfiture of the lurks, but put forward his own apprehensions that the Sharp might proceed to claim authority over parts of Najd, and in sup- ^i° r cu* • 18 * ear observed that in declaring the independence of “ the Arabs ,T the Sharif appeared to treat them as a compendious whole, an attitude which he regarded with anxiety. * 4 i o 1 ! 11 A^ ust h o f r obe again, saying that he had now received a letter from the Sharif m which the latter announced the occupation of Mecca and asked him for his help. Ibn Saud gave a summary of his reply, and a copy of the original letter has since been received. He assured the Sharif that he would render all assistance which was in his power, but asked for a written under taking that the Sharif would abstain from trespassing in his territory or inter- ferm.g w ith his subjects. Ibn. Saud went on to ask Sir Percy Cox whether his. relations with the Sharif might be regarded as a matter which affected the two chiefs alone or whether they touched on our interests, in which case he would be guided by our wishes. According to Arab reports received at .Kuwait the Sharif wrote three times to Ibn Saud asking for aid, and on two occasions sent him £2,000. Not improbably there is some truth in the rumoured remittance of small sums. 4 i i Tll 4 S i larifs answa L dated September 5, to Ibn Saud’s letter was, to say the least of it, unconciliatory and aroused his lively indignation His letter and the draft undertaking which had been sent with it for the Sharif’s accept ance were sent back with the observation that Ibn Saud’s request could emanate only from a man bereft of reason. About the same time Ibn Saud received a letter from Ah Haidar acquainting him with his appointment as Sharif m place of Husan by the Ottoman Government, and calling on him to join the Jihad but m Ins reply Ibn Saud expressed the resentment felt by the Arabs towards him and towards the Turks. Chief Political Officer dealt at length with the Hij’az question in a letter to Ibn Saud, dated October 19th. He pointed out how important it was to the Arab cause, which it was the policy of the British Government to support that all the great Arab chiefs should work together and in co-opera tion with us^in the common task of expelling the Turks from Arabia. As to Ibn Saud s own position he need have no misgivings for he had been acknowledged by us to be an independent ruler and the Sharif must recognize the full import of the treaty. The British Government had no reason to believe that he entertained any hostile intentions against the tribes and territories of Najd. In the negotiation over the treaty in December, 1915, Sir Percy Cox had discussed with Ibn Saud the possibility of his giving us assistance against Ibn Rashid. The Hakim of Najd then thought that' Ibn Rashid would either come in or maintain a strict neutrality; if, however, he showed himself active ly hostile, Ibn Saud wuuld attack him and incite the northern Anazah against him. This intention, however, he failed to carry out. During the spring and summer of 1916 he was occupied with a rebellion of the Murrah, following on, and ^perhaps connected with, that of the Ajman, which endangered his communications with the Hasa. Though a large proportion of the fighting men of the Shammar had gone north with Ibn Rashid against the Iraq, no48 effective attack was made on Hail in their absence. In late June or early July, Ibn Sand’s son, Turki, raided Jabal Shammar and the news may have hastened Ibn Eashid’s retreat from our frontiers. In September or October Turki renewed hostilities against some of the Shammar Shaikhs and an a le section of the Harb, but the affair resulted only m the capture of a small amount of booty, and Ibn Sand’s doctor passing through Bahrain brought a message to the effect that the Amir could do nothing against the Shammar L“ons as the fugitive Ajman remained on his flank. The true reason for his inactivity was no doubt his ovA insecurity at home, but the implacable hostility which he entertained towards Ajman, whom he regarded not only as rebels but as the murderers of his brother Saud, threatened to become a problem of some difficulty. When Shaikh Mubarak died in December, 1915, Ibn Saud pressed his son and successor in Kuwait, Jabir, to drive out the Ajman Shaikhs. Jabir made a temperate reply. He was unwilling to eject the Ajman fearing that they would be thrown into the enemy camp; but he coiild not hold out agamst Ibn Saud’s insistence without creating an open breach and he expelled the tribe in February, 1916. As he anticipated, they turned for protection first to Ajaimi and then to Ibn Eashid, but in May they asked and obtained permis sion from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly near Safwan and subsequently several of the leading Shaikhs made submission to us. When Ibn Eashid returned to Hail onlv two of the Ajman Shaikhs remained with Ajaimi and they had little or no'following. Ibn Saud’s ardent desire to direct his ener- oies upon the extermination of this tribe was not one with which we had any sympathy, at all events at the present juncture. Shaikh Jabir, new to his office, could not hope to exercise the influence over Ibn Saud which had been possessed by that practised and weighty diplo matist his father : moreover for some years before Mubarak s death relations between Eiyadh and Kuwait had been growing cooler Ibn Saud bitterly re sented Mubarak’s attitude during the negotiations between himself and the Ottoman Government in the spring of 1914 According to his account the Shaikh had at first counselled him to accept the Turkish offers but when he reached Kuwait in April Mpbarak changed his note, without explanation, and advised Ibn Saud not to come to terms with the Turks, refusing, at the same time to be present at his meeting with the delegates. So indignant was the Amir that he expresslv stipulated with Captain Shakespear that Mubarak should not be consulted'in the negotiations with ourselves. The asylum given the Ajman was another grievance, and in 1916 Ibn Saud complained of the incidence of the transit dues which had been, from time immemorial, levied in Kuwait. „ n oi •&lt;. i i • While Ibn Saud’s anxiety as to the ambitions of the Sharif, and his grow- ino- estrangement with Kuw r ait showed that the chiefs allied with ourselves had not’reached a satisfactory understanding with each other, there was evidence that the Turks were still active in Arabia. News was received from Ibn Saud and from other sources of the despatch of an agent (Aluhammad) Taufiq Ibn Fara’un of Damascus, for the purpose of buying camels for the Ottoman Gov ernment; the emissary was well chosen, for he was a personal friend of Ibn Saud and had visited’Najd on the same business the previous year. But on this occasion the Amir was pressed by us to prevent him from obtaining camels : he accordingly arrested Ibn Fara’un, confiscated TOO camels which had been purchased in the interior and sent them to Kuwait. Various reports, some of which came from Ibn Saud, indicated that another attempt to stir up Ibn Eashid against us was in the wind. Eushaid Ibn Lailah, Ibn Eashid’s repre sentative 'at Constantinople, joined him at Hail with a few German and Turkish officers, a small body of Turkish soldiers and some guns; accounts varied as to the exact composition of the mission, but its presence in Hail in some form seemed fairly certain. Ibn Saud had written in September that he would be glad of a-personal interview with the Chief Political Officer to dis cuss the question of co-operation with the Sharif or offensive action against Ibn Eashid. In October he repeated the request urgently, and on all grounds it seemed advisable to accede to it. Sir Percy Cox met him at Ojair on Nov ember 11. Ibn Saud explained to him his position in detail. He had lost considerably, in men and material, in the fight with Ibn Eashid in January, 1915. Since then he had been almost continuously in the field, first against the Ajman and then against the Murrah. Most of the normal trade of Najd was with Syria, and the tribes were accustomed to sell their camels to Damas cene dealers: the strict blockade imposed by Ibn Saud—the seizure of Ibn Fara’un’s camels bore witness to its reality—grew more and more galling: the Najdis grumbled, the tribes were restless, all asked wherein lay the advantage to themselves of their Chief’s attitude, and it was increasingly ’difficult for him to keep them in hand. With regard to the Sharif, Sir Percy Cox was able to give Ibn Saud the fullest reassurance. Our treaty with the Amir had been communicated to Mecca, and when the Sharif announced to us his intention of proclaiming himself King of the Arabs on November 5, we had insisted on a formal admission that he claimed no jurisdiction over independent rulers. The news of the coronation at Mecca had not yet reached Central Arabia and was not discussed. During conversation with the Chief Political Officer at -0 \49 S vlul Saud made a passing remark about the Sharif’s calling himself ri ’ bU + t hlS 1 seemed t( J set completely at rest on hearing that his rights were safeguarded by us and that the Sharif had explicitly denied any design on the independence of himself or his compeers. ^ , I bl1 faud having expressed to the Chief Political Officer at their meeting at Ojair his inclination to pay a brief visit to Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait before exDedTen^ ^nTsKP^^P Was cordiall y encouraged as appearing eminently tb^ K P T P d + Per -7 Cox recommended that he should be presented with tlie iv.L.l.K., at a majlis which was to be held at Kuwait where the Shaikh was to be invested with the C.S.I. When he intimated to Ibn Saud that this X-m Tt ° be aC T ded i 0 tbe ? llief Political Cfficer was authorised to inform at the same time that his rights had been carefully reserved in all dealings which the British Government had held with the “Sharif and Ibn Saud m his reply said that he was entirely satisfied on this point. The majlis took place on November 20th. The Shaikh of Muhammerah frXrll 0 X\ ait for „ t be occasion and many Beduin were present, including Mf 1 /«X d Tb lie rX n T? f i- t . be ?bamm a r Aslam, and Dhafir, and Shaikhs of the Mutan. The Chief Political Officer, m presenting the decorations, alluded to our satisfaction m feeling that the great Arab chiefs were bent with us upon a common purpose The Shaikh of Muhammerah followed him with words which were warmly pro-British, and Ibn Saud struck the key-note of the meeting m a speech which was as spontaneous as it was unexpected. He said that the Turks had placed themselves outside the pale of Islam by the iniquities which they had committed on other Moslems. He contrasted their pohcy with that of Great Britain pointing out that the Turks had sought to weaken the Arabs by fomenting their differences, whereas the British Govern ment encouraged them to unite in their own interest. He praised the action of the Sharif and urged the obligation of all true Arabs to co-operate with him m forwarding the Arab cause. &lt; When he had brought his speech to an eloquent ‘twTtW X Cllle / S ’ -^ uwal &gt; Muhammerah and Ibn Saud, swore together that they would work with us for the achievement of a common end. -p , This scene made a deep impression on the local notables and on the Beduin Shaikhs present, who will no doubt carry the tale far and wide. urmg the receptions a,t Kuwait, Ibn Saud showed in all his utterances how ciearlj he had grasped the principle whch guides our relations with Arabia. ±ie quoted as an example of our benevolent policy towards the Arab cause the ill even P romote a reconciliation between himself and \ rn a ^ hld , lf the latter would abandon his attitude of hostility. The arrival of Ibn 1 ara un s &lt; 00 camels, each branded with the wasm of that well-known ■ dealer, gave a dramatic completeness to the Kuwait gathering. Prom Kuwait Ibn Saud went to Muhammerah as the guest of Shaikh Khazai who co-operated most heartily in the endeavour to make Ibn Sand’s visit profitable tu him. The two chiefs arrived at Basrah on the evening of November 26. Early next morning the Chief Political Officer accompanied by two chief military representatives of the Army Commandfer present in Basrah went on board the Shaikh’s launch and presented Ibn Saud with a sword ot honour and message of welcome from the Army Commander. The day was spent m exhibiting to him the Base Camps and organisation and the latest machinery of warfare including the aircraft in which he took an eager interest. fXA Ib ™ 1 ^ alah an d Humud al Suwait, Shaikhs of the Shammar Aslam sX; T X P™ sent ’ wbile Sbaikh Ibrahim of Zubair and several IbTsaud on thelunoh 8668 ^ Baghdad llad an audience - Dllrbc ? r ancl I bn Sand’s visit to Basrah have placed us in a +in gU r+f • tr ? ng Three powerful chiefs have made public protesta tion of their friendship with each other and their confidence in the British Government. A telegram received from the Sharif, congratulating them upon their zeal m the Arab cause and regretting that he had not had time to send a representative to Kuwait, confirmed the identity of his aims with their own, •and m a further message he apologised for any deficiencies in his previous letters on the ground that while he was in the throhs of war he might un intentionally fall short as a correspondent. The dream of Arab unity which enguged the imagination of the Liberals of Damascus during the year before the war, has been brought nearer fulfilment than dreams are wont to come, but the role of presiding genius has been recast. Instead of the brilliant, unscrupulous Saiyid Talib, gyrating in the blast of his own ambition, the chiefs of Eastern and Western Arabia have united at the instance of the British Government. Besides this knitting together of i\rab leaders, the meeting at Kuwait has produced certain immediate results. In the first place the extent and nature of Ibn Sand’s share in future hostilities with Ibn Pashid, if such should occur, was agreed upon. ^ He undertook to maintain 4,000 men under arms: if Ibn Eashid moved in force towards the Iraq he would move up parallel with him towards Zubair and join the friendly tribes and a contingent from Kuwait. He informed the friendly Shaikhs that he would support them if Ibn Eashid threatened to attack them in strength. If, however, Ibn Eashid should re-50 vf' r ^ main at Hail Ibn Sand would harass and attack him as opportunity offered,, uskiff the Qasim as a base. In view of the strain upon his resources during the 1 x | vears he has been given 3,000 rifles with ammunition, as well as fom mactoe gun and granted! monthly subsidy of £5,000 to cover the expenses, he will ifcur in maintaining his men in the field Active co-operation with the Sharif was not considered practicable, but Ibn Saud was ready to se one of his sons with some 40 men to Mecca as a sign of goodwill, it the bhanl would make a special request for them. Secondly, a letter was written by Ibn Saud, in the name of the three chiefs, to Ajaimi Ibn Sadun urging upon him the harm which he was doing’to the Arab cause by his present attitude, inviting him to enter into communication with them and promising him friendly consideration and an opportunity for honourable submission. Finally, with the co-operation of Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait and the diplo matic skill of the Shaikh of Muhammerah who was throughout of the highest service to the Chief Political Officer, the delicate problem raised by the pre sence of the Ajman among the friendly tribes reached a satisfactory solu tion. For the 'period of the war a truce between Ibn Saud and the Ajman was agreed upon and instructions were drafted defining the position of the fugitive Shaikhs with respect to all tribes under our protection. On ins return to Basrah, Sir Percv Cox called in the Ajman leaders. They had been profoundly disquieted by the advent of Ibn Saud thinking that it augured ill for themselves, but the principal and more courageous headmen met the Chief Political Officer at Zubair and accepted the proposed terms, m return for which they were promised a monthly allowance similar to that received by the other friendly Shaikhs of the Shamiyah. They evinced little doubt that the remaining headmen of the Ajman, including the two who were still with Ajaimi, would come in as soon as they heard of the happy issue of their own venture. Letters have been written to Fahad Beg Ibn Hadhdhal informing him of the Kuwait'meeting and inviting him to join the league of Arab chiefs m expelling the Turks. These have been sent through a man from Fahad Beg’s tents who was in Basrah at the time of Ibn Sand’s visit and went to see him at Muhammerah, where he received advice and instruction from Shaikh Khazal in full measure. He was entrusted also with letters from the Sharif which have been waiting opportunity of despatch to Fahad Beg, Hachim al Muhaid, Ali Sulaiman of the Dulaim and others, and with presents in money to guide Fall ad Beg’s decision and to encourage the amicable disposition of the Shaikh of the Dahamshah, Jaza Ibn Mijlad. Communications of the same nature are on their way to Atiyah al Qulal of Kajaf and Muhammad Ali: Kamunah of Karbala. CAPPENDIX B. TREATY WITH IBN SATJD. In the Name of God the Merciful and Compassionate. Preamble. *, i Tl1 ^ Higl1 Government on its own part, and Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin Faisal al Saud, Ruler of Najd, El Hasa, Qatif and Jubail, and the towns and ports belonging to them, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and tribesmen, being desirous of confirming and strengthen ing the friendly relations, which have for a long time existed between the two parties, and with a view to consolidating their respective interests the British Government have named and appointed Lieutenant-Col. Sir Percy Cox, K.C.S.L, K.C.I.E., British Resident in the Persian Gulf, as their Pleni potentiary, to conclude a treaty for this purpose with Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin Faisal al Saud.

II. In the event of aggression by any Foreign Power on the territories of the ‘Countries of the said Ibn Saud and his descendants without reference to the Jlritish Government and without giving her an opportunity of communicating -thlbn Saud and composing the matter, the British Government will aid bn Saud to such extent and in such a manner as the British Government alter consulting Ibn Saud may consider most effective for protectin 0, his interests and countries. III. Ibn Saud hereby agrees and promises to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty, with any Foreign Nation or Power, and further to give immediate notice to the Political Authorities of the British Government of any attempt on the part of any other Power to interfere with the above territories. IY. Ibn Saud hereby undertakes that he will absolutely not cede, sell, mort- gage, lease, or otherwise dispose of the above territories or any part of them, or grant concessions within those territories to any Foreign Power, or to the subjects of any Foreign Power, without the consent of the British Govern ment. And that he will follow her advice unreservedly provided that it be not damaging to his own interests. y. Ibn Saud hereby undertakes to keep open within his territories, the roads leading to the Holy Places, and to protect pilgrims on their passage to and from the Holy Places. YI.

He asks you to take action regarding Wadi Khurraa. This is a village in the S.E. Hejaz, with a population of about 300 or 400 fighting men of the Beni Thor section of Sbei tribe, -and negro freedmen. They have recently been perverted to the Ikhsen sect, one of whose tenets is that its believers can pay political alTfgiance only to Ibn Saud, Emir C r ) of Aridhaud Kasim. Ibn Saud is using Khurma as a base for propaganda against the rest of the Hejaz. My father cannot regard the question as a purely religious one, since each new Wahabi is a political subject of Ibn Saud, and is armed by him, and considered by him as one of his standing army. If their movement westward is not checked, they may take Taif and Mecca in six months. My father has exhausted the Hejaz in the effort to help the Allies against Turkey. Ibn Saud is fresh, and is being paid and armed by your representative in Bagdad. I intend to come to my father*s help with men and machines from my northern army as soon as possible. Meanwhile it would have a good effect (but will not stop the Wahabi movement) if you will insist that Ibn Saud withdrawn Sultan Bijad from Khurma. If you threaten his subsidy he will agree to this, and so give me time to move my forces to Mecca. I have no objection then to your continuing to arm Ibn Saud, since I will be much stronger than him.

Both padres are uncertain of policy 0 f His Majesty's Govern- ^.-t and hope to receive enlightenment from our decision m regard to KhorJJlCl. dispute. AccordingA SECRET. Arabia: The Nejd-Ilejaz Feud. (Note by Political Department, India Office.) 1. The controversy between King Husain and Bin Sand, Emir of Nejd, which has formed the subject of numerous papers laid before the Eastern Committee, has now reached a critical stage. The immediate bone of contention between tnem is the village of Khurma, to which both parties lay claim. The village is actually in the hands of the “Ikhwan,” Bin Sand’s Wahabi followers whom the local Hejaz forces have made various unsuccessful attempts to dislodge. As has often been explained, the enmity between the two chieftains is deep-seated • it reflects many years of rivalry between Mecca and Pdadh, aggravated by personal jealousy ana by the sectarian feud between Sunni and Wahabi/ Political relations with Bin Sand have hitherto fallen within the sphere of Mesopotamia and the Government of India, while those with King Husain have been conducted from Cairo. It is unfortunate that the controversy between the two Chiefs has been to some extent reflected in the views of the two administrations with which they have respectively, been brought into contact. At the present moment Bin Sand’s claims are championed by Colonel Wilson and Mr. Philby, while those of King Husain have the support of Sir It. \\ ingate and Colonel Laurence. It was decided in September last to change the local atmosphere by sending an officer from the Egyptian side to Bin Sand • but the decision has not yet been carried out. 2. As regards the rights and wrongs of the Khurma dispute, the following summary of a .statement made by Sheri 1 Eeisal, King Husain’s son, during a recent visit to the India Office (27th December 1918), gives the Hejaz side of the case The Sherif discussed the relations between Bin Sand, Emir of Nejd, and the Hejaz authorities. He explained the nature of the Wahabi movement, of which Bin Sand is the figure-head and the leading spirit. From the point of view of doctrine, he has no objection whatever to Wahabism.- But it is essentially a militant creed, and is being made to serve political ends. The Wahabis are intolerant of anybody and everything outside their own sect. Ifi ) 01 example, they gained possession of the Holy Places, they would exclude all non-Wahabis from the pilgrimage. So long as Wahabism was confined to Nejd, no one in the Hejaz had any desire to interfere with it. But they cannot tolerate its appearance in the settled area west of the desert. 1 hat is the significance of the Khurma incident. Khurma is the first settled village west of .the desert, and so long as it remains under the mfluence of Bin Saud, it forms an outpost of Wahabism in the settled area. Sheiif Feisal is determined to expel the “ Ikhwan ” (?,.e., the militant Wahabis) from the village. He proposes to do'so in the immediate future arnis ‘ .Fe will direct the campaign in person, and anticipates no difficulty m achieving his object. The matter is a small one, and need not occasion His Majesty’s Government any pre-occupation. He will be quite satisfied with driving the Wahabis back into the desert, and has no intention of carrying the campaign into Bin Sand’s own country. There is one alternative, viz., that the Hejaz people should themselves embrace Wahabism. Feisal is quite prepared to take this course, if the British Government wish ; but it woidd mean closing down the pilgrimage to all rron-W 7 ahabis for the future. •j. For Bin Saud s claims to the village the following extract may be quoted from a report written by Mr. Philby in August 1918 1 : — “ 1 venture to think that IBs Majesty’s Government will revise opinion based on distance of Khurma from Taif. As already pointed out, Khurma is only 10 miles east of 1 unquestionable boundary of Buqum and Subai tribes, namely, Shaib Shaba. Question at issue, therefore, is jurisdiction over western section of Subai tribe, whose capital is Khurma, and whose boundary is W adi Naim, 120 miles east of Khurma. Adjudication of Khurma to Sherif, therefore, necessarily implies extending Houndary of 1 For a more detailed statement of the claim, please see Appendix I. 10 S 16 40 1/19 A9 Hejaz to a line about 200 miles or more east of Taif. This brings up question of Ataiba highlands extending another 100 miles east of Wadi Naim; and as Sherif claims jurisdiction over Ataiba, the boundary of Xejd falls back very nearly to the line Tuwaiq. I earnestly represent (1) that matter is far more complicated than is supposed, and has two sides; (2) that Bin Sand cannot abandon Khurma to its fate without raising widespread disturbance of Nejd tribes . . . . ; and (3) that Khurma will never submit to Sherifian attacks.”- -[Transmitted in Baghdad telegram No. 7418, dated 7th September 1918.] 4 Recent developments at Khurma may be briefly summarised. On the 26th November last Sir R. Wingate telegraphed that “reports of aggressive intentions ” on the part of Bin Sand were reviving m the Hejaz ; and that, according to the local Sherifial military authorities, the “ IkhwaiW’ at Khurma had been reinforced bv 450 mounted men. A few days later (Cairo telegram No. 1827, 6th December) King Husain reported that the Ikhwan had attacked and looted the main supply base of the Hejaz force at Digadiah, about 45 miles north of Taif. The King uro-ed that this aggression, so close to his capital, would precipitate a ciisis, and that the situation could only be saved by an ultimatum ^ fiom His Majesty s Government requiring all Ikhwan concentrations to disperse within 35 days. In a subsequent report (Cairo telegram No. 1857, 10th December) King Husain stated that an Ikhwan force under Sultan Bin Bijad, said to be Bin Sand’s principal agent with the militant Wahabis, was “advancing towards Mecca.” Commenting on this news, Sir R. Wingate remarked that there was “ no longer a doubt, after the Digadiah “ affair, that 3 the Ikhwan at Khurma have assumed the offensive, and constitute a “ menace to the security of Mecca.” He recommended the “ immediate despatch by “ His Majesty’s Government of peremptory instructions to Bin Sand to withdraw ail “ militant Ikhwan from neighbourhood, making it clear to him that failure or delay P “ in compliance will entail reprisals (suspension of subsidy or closing of markets) “ by His Majesty’s Government.” Later reports (Cairo telegram No. 1-881, 14th December) indicate an advance by the Wahabis to a point within 20 miles of Tail During the last three weeks no further news of hostilities has been received. Action on the Hejaz side appears to have been delayed in consequence of the non surrender of Medina by the Turks. 5. His Majesty’s Government decided on the 13th December “to warn Bin Sand “ plainly that if he does not at once abandon and cause his followers to abandon all “ aggressive action against Hejaz, and withdraw all militant Ikhwan now west of “ Khurma, his subsidy will be stopped and we shall consider ourselves free to take “ such further measures as we may deem desirable for maintenance of peace in “ Central Asia.” It was suggested that this message might make more impression ' if personally delivered by Colonel Walson from Jeddah ; but the suggestion did not commend itself to Sir R. Wan gate and was accordingly dropped. Instructions to forward the message from the Mesopotamian side were telegraphed to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, on the 24th December. The latter replied on the 27th December, proposing to send the message by the hand of Captain Bray, Political Agent at Bahrein, but asking to be furnished, as material for the proposed ultimatum, with “ somewhat more recent and, if possible, more reliable information than ex parte “ allegations by King Husain, the veracity of whose previous reports as to Bin Sand “ is not such as to inspire confidence.” It is not known whether Sir R. Wingate has taken any steps to supply the further particulars desired. The Egyptian authorities are inclined to regard the proposed message (which merely requires the withdrawal of Ikhwan west of Khurma) as not going far enough ; and Colonel Wilson (of Jeddah) has expressed the view, which is shared by King Husain, that a “conflagration” is unavoidable “ unless Ikhwan are withdrawn from Khurma and Bin Sand’s occupation of that place through his Ikhwan ended ” (Cairo telegram No. 1927, 23rd December). Mr. Philby, on the other hand, has urged that His Majesty’s Government should intervene “to prohibit Sherif from further aggression,” or should definitely recognise Bin Sand’s “suzerainty over Khurma” (Baghdad telegram No. 10483, 29th November). 6. On one point both Colonel WTlson and Mr. Philby are agreed, viz., that, failing intervention by His Majesty’s Government, an armed conflict is inevitable. The question- arises, if this view is accepted, whether we are bound to intervene, orwhether events can be left to take their own course. Primd facie we are not concerned with the internal feuds of Central Arabia, or with the sectarian contro versies of Islam. The fact that both disputants are in close relations with ourselves is not necessarily a decisive factor, for we are under no obligation to either party to maintain his interests against Arab rivals. It is true that we could not tolerate a Wahabi occupation, of Mecca, which not only would be fatal to our prestige throughout the East, but would lead to endless difficulties over the pilgrimage question. But the M ai Office aie alieady considering the question, of rendering assistance to King Husain for the defence of his capital. Their proposals include, not only the despatch of Muhammadan troops, which seems clearly undesirable and is under stood to have been dropped, but the more practicable suggestion of sup ply in o- arms and war materiel. Moreover, so far as Mecca and the Hejaz generally ai-e concerned, the case is sufficiently covered by the terms of the ultimatum which His Majesty’s Government have already approved. The real question seems to be whether the time has come to insist on a settlement that will definitely assign Khuima to one paity 01 the other, or whether ve should leave the disputants to fight it out among, themselves, putting our trust in (1) our warning to Bin Sand against aggressive action west of Khurma, and (^2) Feisal’s undertaking to content himself with expelling the Ikhwan from the Khurma region, as guarantees for the localisation of the struggle. Against an immediate settlement it may be argued that the advice of our local officers is so conflicting as to make it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to form an equitable judgment on the merits of the case. Sir R. Wingate warns us that King Husain would probably abdicate sooner than accept even provisionally the assignment of Khurma to Bin Saud ; and Feisal has made it quite plain to us that he will not tolerate Wahabi occupation of the district. On the other hand, if Mr. Philby’s reports are accurate, the inhabitants of Khurma have adopted Wahabi tenets and espoused Bin Sand’s cause of their own free will; and their forcible reconversion or expulsion would be unpleasantly suggestive of religious persecution. The objections to letting matters drift are obvious. Our policy is to promote peace and goodwill, and not active hostilities, between our Arab friends. The spectacle of civil war between our two leading proteges will not redound to our credit or strengthen our claims to a “ mandate ” from the Peace Conference for the supervision of Arabian affairs. There is always the risk that the guarantees mentioned above will prove insufficient to localise the struggle, and that either the Hejaz party may advance into regions of which we are pledged by treaty to recognise Bin Saud as “ independent ruler” (Colonel Laurence, I understand, regards this as very improbable, and indeed as impracticable), or that Bin Saud, if successful at Khurma, may push his offensive into the Hejaz, where, for reasons indicated above, his presence would be intolerable. It has to be borne in mind that active military intervention in the Hejaz or Central Arabia is not a practicable proposition ; for practical purposes, our means of exerting pressure, if diplomatic methods fail, is by withholding our subsidy from the recalcitrant party and furnishing his rival with assistance in the form of supplies, munitions of war, and so forth. 7. The question is one that calls for an early decision by His Majesty’s Govern ment. On the whole the Department is disposed to recommend— (1) that the ultimatum already approved (see paragraph 5) should be conveyed to Bin Saud by the hand of Captain Brayl without more ado ; (2) that the evacuation of Khurma itself by Bin Sand’s followers should not be insisted upon; (3) that King Husain should not be asked to accept a provisional frontier (as suggested in Cairo telegram No. 195S, 27th December) definitely assigning Khurma to Bin Sand’s sphere; it would seem sufficient to communicate to him the substance of the ultimatum to Bin Saud and to point out to him that the elimination of the Ikhwan from all regions west of Khurma will secure the Hejaz completely against further aggressive action. He might be assured that we have no intention *of prejudging the question of the status of the district, and merely ask him to exercise patience a little longer until the times are more propitious for a final settlement. 1 Captain N. K E. Bray, M.C., is an officer of the Indian Army, but he was formerly on special duty in the Hejaz and is known to the authorities in Egypt. S 16 A 24 The action proposed is no doubt in the nature of a compromise, and does not go to the root of the difficulty, for which a solution will sooner or later have to be found. But it will gain time, and shonld stave off the immediate danger of a Wahabi advance upon Mecca. It is difficult to believe that Bin Sand will not realise the necessity, in the present situation in Arabia, of keeping his hot-heads under control. It should be f borne in mind that, even if we do not succeed in averting a conflict, the consequences may not be so formidable as is sometimes apprehended. Past experience of inter- Arab warfare tends to show that the results are not always very striking or decisive. The prolonged hostilities between Bin Sand and Bin Rashid are a case in point; the Hejaz operations round Khurma are another. Even when Feisal returns to Arabia and puts himself at the head of the trained levies which he led against the Turks, it is very doubtful whether (apart from his undertaking to the India Office, see paragraphs 2 and G) he can do more than clear the Khurma district of the Ikhwan ; and if he stops at that there seems no reason why His Majesty's Government should not accept the fait accompli. In the last resort we are powerless to prevent it. India Office, J- E. S. 7th January 1919.5 fees ‘Mb Winter- : ^ecisirp W; tile' Jo Arabia :.S« : ee, ® fl t shoolij it US. APPENDIX I.

A bat he in all probability means (turning the circumstance to suit his own present requirements) is that when Ghalib died his successor, Khalid was iqrinaily recorded in the Turkish registers as the rightful recipient of the Hai Lima paid by the furbish Government to all tribes in a position to annoy the annual pi gum .caravans. J hat is a very different matter, and proves nothing, as the pagesI —— 6 of Doiiohty are sufficient to show that Surra was paid to tribes under Ibn Rashid’s admitted jurisdiction—in fact to all tribes likely to be troublesome. On the other hand, going further back, there is very little doubt that Khurma was under the effective jurisdiction of the Sand dynasty in the days of its early greatness, and Ibn Sand claims that the long-standing exemption from taxation, which the people o^s Khurma have enjoyed, and still enjoy, was conferred upon them by Sand the First (or possibly Sand the Great, i.e., Sand the Second, the real founder of the Wahhabi Empire). It is fairly certain that neither the Sheriff nor the Turks have ever collected a mite by way of taxation from the people of Khuima a fact which goes fai to pio\e their claim to independence. If that is admitted the people of Khurma cannot well be blamed if they choose to place themselves under the suzerainty of a power in which they have confidence, and to which they are attached by religious, geographical, racial and other ties, and to resist any claim to overlordship b} T a ruler who has made it clear that he will not tolerate the exercise of their religions according to their own lights. The above remarks, I trust, will be sufficient to show that at any rate theie is a good case for investigation and that no ex parte opinion can dispose of it satisfactorily. The two reverses to his aims which I have reported have doubtless proved injurious to the Sheriff’s prestige, but he has no one do blame for that but himself. I note that the High Commissioner considers that the Sheriff regards Khurma as his territory “ apparently with reason, ’ and that he does not doubt the sincerity of his assmances that Shakir will not advance east of Khurma to attack Ibn Sand’s subjects. If these remarks are intended to indicate that no action is being or has been taken to prevent the development of the Sheriff’s operations and that His Majesty’s Govern ment approve of thus letting events run their course, I can only say I regard the situation with the most lively .apprehension. Until the worst comes to the urorst, however, I cannot believe that His Majesty s Government, after then impartial warning to both rulers to refrain from provocative action, will allow one of the recipients of that warning to disregard it in the very matter in respect of which it was issued. The issue of that warning has. as already reported, had a very favour able effect on Ibn Sand, but he assumes, as I think he is entitled to do; that it will be equally effective on the Sheriff. Finally, a word as to the “ activities of Akhwan agents who are evidently at the root of the trouble.” To the best of my belief the somewhat vague and often reiterated accusation that Akhwan agents have of late been busy undermining the influence of the Sheriff has never been substantiated. In any case it is scarcely applicable to the case of Khurma, whose inhabitants, lock, stock, and barrel, have always been Wahhabis and are all Akhwan and as such require no proselytising. The abortive mission of the Sheriffian Qadhi on the other hand is clear enough evidence that it is the Sheriff who is guilty of interfering with the religious liberty of the people of Khurma. This is no mere vague accusation based on Wahhabi reports, but is fully borne out by the evidence of the letters of the King’s son, Abdulla, of which I have already forwarded translations. Incidentally I may mention that present Wahhabi priest of Khurma and his father before him have occupied the post without a break for 60 years, the father having been appointed by Faisal. APPENDIX II. The alleged Treaty between Bin Saud and the Sherif. The War Office have recently raised the question, at the instance of Colonel Laurence, of the existence of a treaty between Biti Saud and King Husain, assigning the Khurma region to the latter. The position appears to be that in the year 1910 the Sherif, taking advantage of a revolt in Southern Xejcl, sent his son Abdullah to invade Qasim. The invasion was not completely successful, but Bin Saud was forced to accept the Sherif’s terms, which included the stipulation that the great tribes lying between Kejd and the Hejaz should be outside Bin Sand’s sphere. In 1915 Abdullah again led an expedition to enforce the terms of the 1910 treaty, but peace w r as patched up and Abdullah retired.t f W—Mj TrrTr TfSTfTIT' Saud and the Suer if.
