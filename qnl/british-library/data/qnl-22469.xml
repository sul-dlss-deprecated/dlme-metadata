Ba r 93 6&gt;o ^ ' Respected Sir, You have been good enough to raise the wages of office Farrashes recently. I also belong to your office menial Staff but I have not been fortunate enough to get something by way of an increment. Between my father who is now infirm and myself we have served this Agency for over fifty years# I am now being paid a total amount of P-s.28/- p.m. for washing the uniforms of farasshes, Khalasis, and cushions and covers etc of Agency launch, and the work of these people'is deliverable every four days. Apart from my personal labour, the price of washing soda and charcoal is still costly and I feel that I have not been given anything compatible with the prevailing market rates. I am also washing the uniforms of farrashes of the Publicity Office for which I get Ss.7/- only per month. Taking into consideration my long service and the high cost of living which is still prevailing, I humbly request you s. your Honour to raise my pay as done in the case of other menial staff, and for this act of kindness I will ever pray for your Honour's long life and prosperity. Your most obedient servant I beg to remain. Sir, (i.e Maikoo Dhobi)/V^'4 fK Bahrain, yy May, 1945- ^ To His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Respected Sir, ^ I intend to bring ray nephew Mahabir Sanab Badloo Dhobi from U.P. to Bahrain to assist me in my work which is daily increasing. He is already now in Karachi. His passport etc. is in order. But on account of the difficulty in obtaining the passage he is unable to come here, and is waiting for a deck passage since 13th March 1945. As the life in Karachi is very costly, and a poor man cannot afford to stay in a costly place without any earning like this. I therefore request your Honour kindly to arrange with the Shipping Company to grant him early passage to Bahrain. Hoping to be excused for the trouble, I beg'to remain.

I submit this application requesting your kindness to favour me with a work of farash, if required by your office. I am a Bahrain national. I ask you to give me work to support myself. U.E. Bahrain Receipt no-5./.^.?...»»« J5*-. 'Thank you for your work on the case. It seems to me, hoy/ever, that, like most others, it must be approached on the basis of what is possible rather than of what is desirable. it is probably logically indefensi ble that the basic pay appears to have been the same 32 years ago as it is now; at the same time, it would be waste of effort to go to the Government of India asking for revision of this rate when they hafHturned down the proposal six months ago. Furthermore, it must be remembered that the real question (as I gathered it Ito be — the farrash's application does not seem to be with these papers) is what the farrashes want. I do not believe they care a straw whether the increase is granted in the form of extra basic pay, war allowance, or in any other way. The contingency (mentioned at N/para. 63 of your note) which will arise if the Government of India decide to cancel war allowance, can be met when it does arise, in any case, even the Government of India would hardly take such action without giving us a chance to express our views. I think also that once the principl of 'pay based on the cost of living' has been put into practice in the case of clerical and menial establishments — and also, to some extent, in the case of officers — it will not be readily departed from. The fact then that the basic pay remains at the 1913 or any other figure may be an illogicality^but fctet would be irrelevant- What we might be able to do — and as far as I C an i'We we have any chance of doing — is of getting an increase in the Dearness Allowance — if it is justified. | To discover whether it is or not,.I should like a reply to | ray questions at N/para.66. It would be useful also to know if there has been any increase in the cost of living since March, 1945, when the last increase in D.A. was sanctioned/-Reference above. ftotos* A list showing the farrashes who have been dismissed or who have resigned is submitted below as desired by P.A. at ' C ' above.

As regards clothing, approximately for the last 7 months none of the inhabitants of Manama or Ivluharraq have been getting any rations from the Eood Control, and the people have been compelled to buy their urgent requirements from the black market, i.e. Bafta at Rs.5 or 4 per yard, Cheet Rs.3/8/- or Rs.4 per yard and Malafa 1 Rs.8/- per Malfa* of 2^. Other things like household requirements of utensils, crockery etc., ase very expensive, and no one can get his indispensible requirements without paying the price demanded by the black-marketter please. \ ^ -v : J a/iO / 83. Reference your noting at paragraphs 75 and 76. With due deference I don't think your proposal to go for an increase in dearr^ess allowance only will meet the case and I personally feel we should go on pressing for an increase in the basic pay in the hope that one day we may succeed. Your predecessor in his letter at page 168 of the previous volume put up the case on tbe basis of the rise in the cost of living during the past six months and asked for an increase of basic pay and allowances for the duration of the war. I suggest instead we go for an increase in the basic pay on the grounds that it is in 1946 exactly , the same as it was in 1913. As a matter of interest, the basic pay (I think I am correct in this) of the Indian Array Jawan was at the beginning of the war about Rs.16/- per month and had not changed since about ,1900. It was increased at the beginning of the war to imagine, exactly the same grounds as we are trying to make out for our menial staff. I agree that war allowance would not be cancelled without giving us a chance to express our views, but, I do feel thatiif we can prepare the ground for an increase in basic pay when the war allowances are eventually done away with by having previous requests for the increase in basic pay on record j then it would be useful. 84. The Joint petition which has again brought forward this question is merely one of the numerous complaints with which A.P.As. have had to compete over many months. 85. i don 1 1 think that there is any justification for a rise in the dearness allowance and I think the Head Munshi's figures at N/para 82 bear this out. The clothing situation is now in h^nd and there should be no more complaints of having to buy in the black market. The reason for them having to do so during the last six months is fairly obvious. 86. We might try a rather different line from that previously adopted e.g. (Basic rate of pay ) 1913 (Cost of living Index ) &amp; )House rents.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to the porrespondence resting with the Govt, of (Code word for telegrams.) .y India, E.4*D« memo.No.F.27(64)-E/44, i '&gt;3 . A l JJ) * dated the 15th March, 1945, forwarded •/ with Bushire Residency P.L.No.1475-64/283, dated the 31st March, 1945, and to state that in order to stop whole s s y ;n'C &gt;2 -19ie S ^P; MFP- (M-1499)-13 .11.40—60,000 Pads resignation of my farrashes I again feel bhe necessity for pressing for a suitabie revision in their basic pay. ^arrashes in this Agency are at present jiven an opening pay of Ks.20/- p.m. in the grade of Rs.20-1-30/- which is exactly the same pay which they were getting in the year 1913. It will be readily accepted that the conditions of living at present are more costly than inlubV they were in 1913. The cost* of food and I clothing which are the first necessities of human life have gone up far higher3? than expected during the last gew years. 2. A man in Bahrain in 1913 was able to live upon Rs.20/- p.nu with his family of two members. A bag of rice used to cost Es.6/- only. Flour was also available at the same price or less. Due to the expansion of Oil industry and other commercial activities the housing problem in Bahrain has also become very actute, and the rents have been intole^rbly high to the extent that A v the low paid peopie are no longer able to afford to pay these high rents. In 1913, the rent for huts was Rs.2/-pm, and for mud houses Rs.4/-p.m. The same huts and mud houses are now leased for Rs. 10/- . and 25/- p.m. respectively. The reason for this difference is due to the fact that there were no foreigners in Bahrain before. 3. Coolies in 1913 were getting-/6/- and -/8/- per day, but the rise in the cost of necessities of life has consequently raised the wages of human labour. The unskilled coolies at the Bahrain ^etroleum Co.Ltd.,draw Re.l/8/- plus /6/- per day and after 12 months continuous service they go up to Rs.2/6/- per day. Same rise in wages apply to the b.O .A.C. ,the C &amp; W.Ltd.,Gray Mackenzie i Co.Ltd, and such other commercial firms. Besides these higher wages, some of the above concerns give rations and clothing at concessional rates to thelir employees. The conditions will not Improve soon, as the labour market is a seller's market and is likely to remainso as the Gulf opens for Trade and other comiflercial purposes. 4 # On account of their xac small scale of pay and want of other facilities like rations, not less than twelve farrashes have resigned ftax from their service during the last twelve months, and have joined better paid employment elsewhere. Hence I am always finding it increasingly difficult to maintain an adequate staff suitable to the required standardof efficiency in work. I therefore again request you kindly to approach the Govt, of India to revise the basic pay of my Menial Estab. at an early date.
