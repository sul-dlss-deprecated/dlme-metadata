Kemball writes to report that the hostilities have ceased, with vessels from both places returning to the pearl banks. However, Kemball warns that he expects further struggles between the rival factions of the Utoobee [ʿUtūb] tribe in future, and that Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh’s protestations at returning the thirteen boats his people had seized from Bahrain were significant.The following enclosures are included with Kemball’s letter:1. Letter no.116 of 1854 (folios 35-36) from Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, to Kemball, dated 16 July 1854, which is an account of Robinson’s cruise to Bahrain, his meetings with the Sheikhs of Bahrain and Dammam, and is meetings with the British Agent in Bahrain, Hajee Jassim [Hajjī Jāsim]. Robinson reports that the restitution of property and agreements on the punishment of the responsible parties has been established, although neither Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa nor Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh is happy with the settlement;2. The translation of a letter (folios 37-42) from Hajjī Jāsim to Kemball, dated 12 July 1854. Jāsim reports that hostilities have been resolved, and some boats from Bahrain have sailed out to the pearl banks. Jāsim also reports on his meeting with Commodore Robinson, Shaikh Muḥammad bin Khalīfah and his brother Shaikh ‘Alī, in which the terms of an agreement to cease hostilities were established, and the Resident’s role in mediating future conflict. Jāsim also mentions a letter he has received from the fugitive Humeed bin Mujdell.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000008#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
