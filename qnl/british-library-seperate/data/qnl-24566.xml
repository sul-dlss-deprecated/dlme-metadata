The diary entries also discuss reports in the Indian press of an incident at Beyla [Bela] which neither the Political Agent nor the Khan had received any information about; an enquiry being undertaken by the Khan into Jaghires within his state; and reporting on Kafilas passing through Khelat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x00001f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
