You will observe that three of the tickets are split into 11 A*” &amp;nd T, B l! portions, and that the amount of oil upon which royalty is payable on each of these three particular Z 2 CJ runs is the total of the two tickets (A plus B) * Howev r, the total amounts appear on the ”3” tickets, before the amounts already accrued on the ,? A” tickets are deducted. Our reason for ’’splitting” these deliveries is that, in order to obtain an accurate accounting on crude oil produc d, we are compelled to fix a time when one month ends, and a new month commences. As you will notice, the time is 5 A.M. on the first day of the Calendar month. As far as Shaikh ^ir Hamad is concerned, this procedure will make no difference whatever to the total amount of royalty payable to the Bahrain Authorities. He will, however, be assured of getting the royalty on all oil delivered to the Refinery and ^itra tanks during the period in whicn it was physically pumped into those tanks, without waiting until an official high gauge is taken - sometiEes several aaya ^tar the close of an accounting, or royalty, period.■ H.M’s Secretary of State for India, London.
