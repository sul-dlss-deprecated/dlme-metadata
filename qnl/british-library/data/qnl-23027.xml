Pelly is, I believe, an officer of Branch A. I think his grade is 6 or 7. I have searched the regulations, but I cannot find an 'A” Grade anywhere. As an officer of Branch A ^rules governing his pay and allowances are all in Foreign Service Regulations, issued by the Foreign Office on January 1st 1949, copies of which are held at the Agency. The Regulation concerning subsistence is that on Travelling allowance; regulation 6, in Chapter 2. As the subsistence rules are rather involved, and I could only quote at length from the book, I shall not go into details here. You will be able to work it out all right from the instruction. 'I~ * Rates payable for various parts of the world are laid down by Circular, as they change from time to time.

In the first place . you have effected the conversion at 1326’instead of at 1500.

As regards Consular Fees for the Bahrain Agency, a discrepency will be noticed between the figure shown in the 'H' form and the figure shown in the accounts. This is explained by the fact that certain amounts collected in the month of September 1949 were actually credited in October 1949 and so also certain amounts collected in the December 1949 quarter were actually credited only in the March 1950 quarter. The difference is reconciled as under:- Amount shown in Account LESS Amount collected in Sep. quarter but actually credited in Dec*.quarter ADD Amount collected in Dec. quarter but actually credited in March 1950 quarter Actual amount collected as Consular Fees in Dec. 1949 quarter and shown in Form ,, H ,, Rs.26,960-. 8- 0 Rs. 3.958- 0- 0 Rs.23,002- 8- 0 Rs. 1.178- 4- 0 Rs.24,180-12- 0 = £1,797- 7- 4 = 263-17- 4 = £1,533-10- 0 = 78-11-0 = £1,612- 1- -0 The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.1. 23rd October, 1950.Nothing to be Written in this Margin. Reference F.O.Memorandum (7F02422/550) of 23rd. October, 1950. The Finance Officer has T think been rather premature in asking for the statement of Mr. Felly's Muscat visit expenses of fls.47/2. Although he quotes the amount as being recorded in the September 1950 Quarterly A/c., which in reality it has, I feel that he has based his claim on the Form 0.F.9 submitted for advice to Finance Dept., on the date payment was made. The fact that the Residency Account was despatched by bag from here on 23rd. Oct., and the F.O. letter dated the same day does, I'm sure,confirm my deduction. For the F.O's information a detailed statement of travelling expenses, in duplicate, was included at Voucher No.8, Schedule 11 of the Residency September 1950 Quarterly A/c..

I have added a paragraph in the draft submitted below. i /Vo. r.o- 3 2- ctj Letter No.227/8/ 50 of 21st January,1950 from Mr.Ball .Residency . In Mr.Ball's letter, there Is no precise answer to rc our query. * The Foreign Office Circular 047 referred to in para-3 of the p.u.c. is not traceable. From the F.O. letter referred to in the same para, see paper flagged with the F.0.Regulations, it is gathered that the latest rate of subsistence allowance is 35s. per night. A perusal of F.Service Regulation 7 o shows that an ,, A ,, grade officer is entitled to receive full Cf J subsistence allowance for himself and 3/4 of the full allowance / for his wife. It is stated elsewhere in the same regulation that subsistence allowance is payable to an Officers wife only iXx •where the Secretary of State has been satisfied in advance that it was necessary or desirable for her to accompany the Officer • In the past instance, see paper flagged 'A”, only 2/3 of the allowance has been paid, l/3 having been deducted for free accommodation. Calculating on this basis, if subsistence allowance is considered a right payment for Mrs.Pelly also, the amount will have to be worked out as under:- Allowance for Mr.Pelly for 2 nights Allowance for Mrs.Pelly for 2 nights i.e. 3/4 of full rate Less l/3 for free accommodation 70s. 52s.€d . 122 s *6d• 40s•lOd•he hi n 2- uj - @ Letter T T c. (XF1320(25/49) dated 16t h February 1,950, from Finance Department. A study of Appendix 'A' of F.O.Circular No.061 (placed below for'ready reference) gives a clear idea of the direct accounting procedure. Any action on the p.u.c. can be taken only at the end of March 1950. At the end of this month, the present Foreign Office account will have to be split into two ag 'Bahrain Agency Foreirig^Office Account-A' and '^a v uin Agency Foreign Office Account - B'. A sum in excess of our requirements to meet the April expenditure will have to be transferred from the present account to the new account 'B'. The present account, after effecting this transfer, should be named as account 'A M . The euhrain Post Office should be asked to deposit the moneys effective 1st Arpil to the account 'B' specifically a n ^ send us their . advice. Two D.F.A.s to be issued at the end of the month. After the requirements at N/para above^ are | completed, a letter will have to issued to Finance Department giving details of the amount transferred both in local currency as well as sterling equivalent, as per para 5 of the p.u.c. The monthly statement of Post Office Deposits which is at present being sent to Finance Department, will from 1st April onwards have to be forwarded to the Accountant General's Department-, General Post Office, London as indicated * in para 1 of the p.u.c. It is suggested that we send copy of the p.u.c. to Sharjah in order to enable theli to adopt the same procedure effective 1st April in respect of the deposits they receive from the Dubai Post Office. D.F.A. to ohdi. .lah. After the above arrangement takes effect, the funds required by this Agency as well as the Residency will hav- to be transferred to their respective accounts from the * 'Bahrain Agency F.O.account - 'B' from time to time, as indicated in para Xxia&amp;xfck 3 of the p.u.c.n L- P* z 5 a &lt; s tn x H Z hi h- 5 5 UJ m o h O z X t- o z 8 / )o Ol M inutes.

We had written to M.O.W. London for Telegraphic Transfer as we desired to introduce the direct funding system as indicated in their communication vide S.37 of the linked file. From the P.U.C. it is clear that the Foreign Office desire to continue the system of funding the M.O.W. from the F.O. account only. It is required that we should transfer monies required f/oythe M.O.W. from the F.O. account-B through the F.©.Account - A. In otherwords, we should transfer the amount required k for M.O.W. from the^icjo^rit B, ito A in the first instantcand then the same amount will have to be retransferred to A the M.O.W. account from the Account A. ■ Each time we wish to effect such itransfers we will have to write to the Bank Itwo letters one asking for the transfer of a •certain sum from F.©.account B to F.O. account A and the cshKX other asking for the same amount jto be transferred from the F.O. account A to the Ministry of ' r 'orks Account. RECOVERY: Till now the practice has / a been to send a schedule under the Head 'M.O.W.' to F.O. along with the quarterly accounts setting down all the amounts advanced by us to M.O.W. from F.O. account and F.O. use to recove] j the amount direct in London. Instead^ accord ing to the p.u.c. we will have to dsib.w a bill bf exchange in favour of the Finance Officer London for the amount advanced to M.O.^. feach time a transfer takes place. The Amount of this bill will be immediately kXB±±fcMQtxfciaxFxfixxjtKKHHKfcx3tA&amp;x recovered in London. We have transferred to-day a sum of Bs.5,000/- to M.O.-W. from F. ©.Account ‘'A'. To make up this sum, we should write to the 2^ IBank to transfer a like sum from account 'B' to account '‘A'.

S.134 was received on the 25th February last. As the item of Rs.250/- referred to therein pertained to 1948 accounts, a thorough search had to be made in our various Official &amp; Unofficial accounts in this Office with a view to locate the item. In the meanwhile S.135 &amp; S.136 followed. After making considerable search in this office with a view to locate the entry of the above item in vain, I contacted the Accountant of the British Bank, obtained from the bank the cheque in Question and handed the same to the Accountant of the Eastern Bank with a request to find out from the bank books as to in which account the item was credited. The Eastern Bank naturally took some time to find this out At' they had to dig out from the godown all the old ledgers and vouchers. I have now received the following information from the Eastern Bank. The cheque in question was deposited by the Agency Accountant (my predecessor) in the then Agency Treasury Account, ± on 29-7-48. The said Agency Treasury Account was since closed down on 9-2-49 and the balance amounting to £40,987-ll-5d was remitted to Foreign Office which remittance the F.O. have acknowledged at S.6 Flagged below. Obviously therefore the item of Rs.250/- was also included in that remittance. D.F.A. to Finance Department.

With a view to ascertain myself whether the letter in question was received at all in the Agency, I called for his Peon*s Book and it was found that the letter has been received here on the 22nd June. There is however no entry of this letter in our Inward Register. I do not remember to have received any such cheque and r/eh if I had, I have no doubt that I would have deposited it at once in view of the large sum of the cheque. After searching thoroughly in my office for the letter and cheque, I contacted Mr.Ross of the Eastern Bank over the phone to get it ascertained v/hether any such cheque for Rs.3,592/- was debited to Col.Grant*s account and Mr.Ross gave me to understand that there was no such debit in Col.Grant*s account in the Bank. Obviously therefore the cheque in ques tion has been lost or mislaid in the Agency. It is therefore very urgent that we should draw the attention of the Bank Manager to the fact that the cheque in question has been lost or mislaid and therefore he should draw our attention in case it is presented for payment by anybody. As the payment of a cheque can be stopped by the drawer only, we should wire Col.Grant asking him to advise the Eastern Bank telegraphically stopping the payment of the cheque. rMinutes. /&lt;?2- /ti 182 Letter No.A^cts/4/ll/50 dated 28th Oct. from Residency Action already taken on telephonic request (Vide S.180 &amp; 181).
