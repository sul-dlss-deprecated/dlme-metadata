I am not in that area at present but I will investigate later.V (W; Copy of letter dated the 7th Dhul c^ada 1358 from the Wall of Khasab to H.H. the Sultan of Muscat. n I have to report that on the 13th Shawal a craft of your servant Haji Muhammad al Batran came from Karachi with a carjo of rice. When the craft was passing by Lima a boat appeared there in which there were 8 armed Baluchi plunderers. Immediately the boat came on the way of the craft and the plunderers frightened the sailors and tied them up with ropes. Then they started discussing about taking away the craft and its contents and to do away with the sailors. But clemency from God moved their hearts and they took away only the cargo - 44 bags of rice, 3 bags of flour ?and the proper ties of the sailors, as soon as the craft arrived here and the Nakhuda informed us of the Tact, I sent my brother Hilal with 40 persons for their arrest. By the grace of God the culprits were found at Diba and by the help of Hasan Rahma they were arrested. There were 2 persons Murad bin Mir Haji and Muhammad bin Sulaiman who are the worst type of man and two of their servants. I send to you herewith the arrested Baluchis in the boat which they plundered and also the sailors with 4 persons from your servants for their escort. They are from those persons who pursued the plunder ers to Dibar. They have Baluchi weapons - 2 guns and 2 rifle-belts containing 34 bullets. They have a Sambuq (boat) worth about Rs.80/-.
