P. Political Agent, Bahrain. Res id en t # Bushire. (D Dated and received SOth October 1921). PRIVATK MD M03T CQ^Fm^TIAL . I had a straight talic with Shaikh today regarding oil concession. He assured me that his sole reason for favouring Holmes was his desire not to incur the displeasure of his father 'by dishonouring former concession which 'botn had signed. He said no one had informed him that His i^ajesty's Government had at any time disapproved of Syndicate. He had no objection to Anglo-l'ersian Oil Company and had only been approached by them onoe through Mackie, to whon he had disclosed his reaaons for wanting • Holmes, and who had appeared to accept them as satisfactory. I feel sure that the above is a true explanatidi of Hamad*s attitude, in which he still persists owing to a growing desire to appease his father. But I cannot believe that the lhaikh would not have accepted the advice of Kis iaajesty's Government even at the cost of displeasing his father which he hae already done a hundred times over. For the present, in view of His Ilajesty's Government's approval of the Syndicate and Holmes T presence here, it seems impossible to divert the Shaikh's sympathies in the direction of the Anglo Persian Oil Company. Opinion in Bahrain is decidedly in favour of immediate oil concession. MALL AH.82/1. Resident, Bushire. Secretary of State for Colonies, London. Najd oil concession. I have learnt in Bahrain that there is a hitch between Ibn Saud and the Syndicate because (a) Sultan refuses to alter a clerical error of date (b) Syndicate refuses to advance more money. Holmes told me that Syndicate promised to work concession even thoughno British Diplomatic Mission was installed in ITajd, but financiers in England refuse to float a Company until 'security' through Diplomatic agency is assured.

Dear Sir John, I am very glad to hear of your recovery,which I hope will not be undone by an excess of work on your return to office. A question has arisen here which I think can better be explained in a personal letter. Professor de Bockh,of whose international repute you are aware,has recently visited our Persian Fields as our Ghief Geological Adviser. In his discussions with our Ghief Geologist he laid great stress on the necessity for a widening of our knowledge of the regional geology of the Persian Gulf, and expressed his desire for a traverse of the Kuwait area in order to afford further material for his larger ■ regional interpretations of Persian geology generally. On first learning of the proposal by our Geological Department to conduct a reconnaissance survey in the Kuwait area in the coming cool season,I asked that definite arrangements be suspended pending your approval, ^ N ' o for incomplete negotiations for a concession by one department here and action by another,which might be interpreted as having an intentionally direct relation to the concession question,might lead to misunderstanding. I do not suggest that any knowledge of the surface geological indications in the Kuwait region would be Sir John Shuckburgh,K.G.M.G'be vlLluelese to us in discussing a concession for that area,'but I take it that if we have the Sheik's approval you will have no objection to the proposed reconnaissance by two of our Geologists,since the question at issue between us over the Gulf concessions has no relation to the existence or non-existence of oil in those areas,or to the geological information which we are seeking for assistance in the interpretation of our Persian problems. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) H . j ] .Nichols....Copy. Britannic House, Finebury Circus, London,E«C.2. 23rd November, 1925, Dear Sir John, I wrote to you on the 30th October regarding a proposed geological traverse of the Kuwait area during the present cool season. Mohannnerah are anxious for a definite determination of the season's geological programme and have telegraphed for our decisions. Since our decision is dependent on your acquiescence,! should be much obliged if you could confirm the anticipation in my previous letter that you will have no objections,if the Sheikh is agreeable.

Sir, I am directed 'by the Secretary for Mines to refer to your letter of September 4th, No.89178/31, enclosing a draft letter to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in regard to the Gompany ! s proposal to undertake a geological survey in Kuwait, and to request you to inform Mr Secretary Thomas that he concurs generally in the terms of the draft letter. It appears to the Secretary for MirES, however, that it would be desirable to make some reference in the proposed reply to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company 1 s inquiry as to whether they can be given every facility for carrying out the survey without being required to make any payment. It is in accordance with usual practice to make no charge, or at least only a nominal fee, for the right to carry out a geological survey in undeveloped territory. In India no Exploration Licence appears to be necessary. The India 'Mines Begulations' state M The issue of iilxploration Licences authorising the surface of the land to be searched for minerals having been discontinued, the surface of unoccupied and unreserved land which is the property of the G-overnment may be freely he Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, S.W.I.7.1 freely searched without authority :T . As far as this Departrnent can ascertain, the only fee charged to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company in respect of the G-eological Survey which it recently carried out in Somaliland was a nominalone of £5. In -gypt Exploration government is in principle free upon all unoccupied and unreserved^ land although exclusive rights to explore in certain specified areas may exceptionally be granted to approved applicants for which no fee appears to be specified in the Mining Regulations. It is true that in Trinidad a scale of fees is laid down for use in connection with Exploration Licences ranging from £50 per annum for areas not exceeding 250 acres to £1,250 per annum for areas in excess of 100,030 acres, but it is suggested that no comparison can fairly be drawn between a well- developed country such as Trinidad where oil is. known to exist and a large oil industry has already been built up and desert territory such as Kuwait which is comparatively unexplored and to which the sending of an expedition must involve considerable expense. The Secretary for Mines recognises, however, that a difficulty may arise in that the Eastern and General Syndicate have already offered, in the draft concession which they have submitted, to pay a fee of Rs 30,0)0 under Exploration Licence (on signature of the agreement) and Rs.20,000 annually thereafter although the Concession if granted would have covered rights to a Prospecting Licence and a lining Lease. It is suggested that in comnunieating with the Resident in the D ersian Guif and the Political Agent at Kuwait the considerations referred to above may be brought to their attention. Thei The Secretary for Mines considers that in view of the difficulty of inducing British Companies to undertake exploratory work under present conditions, it is important that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should be given every encouragement and all facilities which can reasonably be afforded them.

In order that we may comply with the wishes of our Principals it is necessary in the first place to obtain your concurrence, and in the second place to obtain the approval of H.E.The Sheikh of Koweit. r e shall therefore be greatly obliged if, firstly, we may receive your agreement and support for the proposed survey, and secondly, if trie Political Agent at Koweit could be asked to obtain the necessary approval from a.E.The Sheikh. We presume that h .E.The Sheikh will not require from us any payments in resoect of this survey, more especially as we are not at this stage seeking any formal exploration license, but we should of course be prepared to pay for protection and any other necessary expenses on account of services which H.E.The Sheikh might see fit to render us. We should be much obliged if it would be possible K for the Political Agent to approach H.E.The Sheikh in this connection, and if you would advise us in due course in regard to the terms and conditions upon which h .E.The Sheikh would be agreeable to permit this survey to proceed.

I have recently spent five days at Kuwait and tooic the opportunity of discuasing tiie natter niUi the ahaikh. His loccellency, as I anticipated, wel comed the proposal. 2. He is being pressed at the present moment by the notables of his toi?n to come to terms i»ith Major Holmes of the Kastem and General syndicate. The financial position of Kuwait is very bad at the present time owing partly to t ic blockade by Ibn t&gt;aud, and partly also to the slump in the pearl market: considerable pressure is therefore being put on the ahaikh at present by interested parties to grant a concession to tiie jsastern and ueneral Syndicate, vihich, they say, would at any rate bring some money into thie Principality. I am addressing you ee^rately regarding present negotiations between the Shaikh and Major Holmes, but the jhaikh informed me most emphat ioally His Majesty^ Secretary of iitate for the Colonies, Colonial Office, 3Jowning Street, L 0 V P 0 X.I -2- £) empbatlofiily that he would not agree to giant any American concern any conceesion in Kuwait, and he had given the deputation i4io liad waited on him a very short answer, and told them that under no circumatances would he agree to grant any cunceasion to isajor holmes until the latter agreed to his oonditions which included the insertion of the H jNat ionality Clause'. 3. r i ; he shaikh therefore welcomed eagerly the appearance of the Anglo-^rs4an uil Company andj'said that he would gladly grant them any facilities that they asked lor. r ihiB will of course strengthen his nanus in resisting the demands of his subjects that lie should grant a concession to Major Holmes. I have therefore informed the Anglo- j^ert.ian Oil Comyany that tncy may proceed with the explora tion as soon as they like and that no payment will be required, other than payment for guards or any form of protection that may be necessary. &amp; 4.

Cir, I have the honour to report that ilr.Ghaw, Chief 'Fields** Geologist of the Anglo Persian Oil Company Ltd., arrived suddenly last night (14th April 1932) and brought a letter for . myself from the General tianager at Abadan anc another for His Excellency the Shaikh. i 2 # The purport of both letters, copies c£ which I am forwarding with this, was to the effect that all geological, explor ation work in Kuwait was to be abandoned forthwith. At the request of ilr.Shaw I took him round to ca. on His Excellency at S.SO.a.m. on the 15th April, ^oth to give him an opportunity of thanking the Shaikh for all his many kin ^esses in furthering the efforts of the geological party during its stay in Kuwait territory, and in order that he might bid His Sxcellency farewell. 4 # His Excellency was quite obviously distressed to receive the sudden news, and expressed his proCound disappo in triers that the Directors of the Anglo Persian Oil Company Ltd. had seen fit to abandon their efforts so soon, just,when to his b±k S xxxx uninitiated mind success was in sigb.t.

The Shaikh I happen to know welcomed the arrival of the oompany^ geologists in his territory, and was in high hopes that their investigations would result in their applying for a 'concessionThis would have effectually got him out of any 'national clause' difficulty. Lir.Holmes would now appear to have a clear field to continue his activities on behalf of his American principals the ^astern and General syndicate, 8.

May l£LQu-L232 at BUS^SHE HE8iD«Nt. f7~~9vr M SiMNTitT'^ V V s —1 I am enclosing In original a 'personal' letter which I recently received from Sir Arnold Alison, as you ought to be kept aware of every move In the 'oil game' which Is going on here. 2. On receipt of Sir Arnolds letter I took upon myself the responsibility of seeing the Sheikh and informing him verbally and in as tactful a manner as I could, of what the former had said in his para 2. I of course took special care to say that what I was communicating was entirely un official . and that I was onl3r passing on a friendly message of Sir Arnold Wilson, made to me in a purely private capacity, I further added that I took no responsibility at all for what I had been asked to spy, 3. The Sheikh as I expected he -.-rould^ rejected the proposal at once, saying that it would neither be fair on himself or on Holmes, were he to grant an exclusive option as promos^d. He asked me to Inform Sir Arnold to tl.ls effect, and to say that he was prepared to consider, as he had always been ready to ^ formal application for an 'oil concession' from the A.P.0*0. in the same way as Holmes was doing, but nothing more. The Company whicl offered the best terms would get the concession, always provided that H,M.Gr,. approved the wording of the various clauses, 4. The Sheikh rather heatedly told me that he had be.n 'blamed on all sides by letter and otherwise (presumably by Holmes In particular) for having again allowed the A.P.0.3. Geologists into his ccvr -try when another Companys proposals were before him. He had however done so he said simply because H.M,G-, had supported and blessed the A.P.O.Cs request. As the A,P,0.0. had been foolish enough to withdraw their men, he could not see his way to let them in again in order to sink The Honble, Lieut-Colonel H.V.Biscoe Political Resident i J :&gt;e Persian Gulf,sink shafts and dig holes etc. etc,, and generally lay bare the possibilities of his county. They ought to come forward like Holmes v4as doing, and make him a straight business of ^er, and chance whether there was oil or not: This he said Holmes was at present doing, and in exchange for a concession was d3 .ily renewing his money offer, for a handsome sum of money down and much more to follow if oil were found. 5* Obviously Holmes has been bringing heavy pressure to bear on the Sheikh since he came b ,cV from Bahrain and I think has got him largely on his side now, 6» The Sheikh greatly resented the sudden withdrawal of the geologists, for he had formed great hopes that as a result of their work the A.P.O.G. would come forward and firmly bid against Holmes' people. Holmes has not failed to seize the opportunity to strenghen his position, and daily I believe points out that the A. P. O.C. are only flirting with him, the Sheikh, whilst he,Holmes, had never deviated from his original offer to negociate an agreement, with financial benifits to the state. 7. AS I have mentioned elsewhwre, on Holmes' return here, the Bazaar was filled with rumours that the Eastern General Syndicate had brought an action in London against the A, P.0.0. and had won, hence the withdrawal of the geologists. The rumour must have originated from Holmes. 8. To sum up the local situation at present seems to be that while A.P.O.0.'stock' has depreciated tsxrifciy heavily. Holmes' 'stock' has gone up. 9* The A.P.O.C. are, rather late in the day, trying to rehab ilitate themselves with the Sheikh f and Elkington is now arrangin • to send the Sheikh a searchlight for his yacht. He of course ought to have done V is t T *c years a^c, 10. I have written to Sir Arnold Wilson and told him that the Sheikh did not at all 'jump' to the £2000/- idea. 11. In the meantime I am closely watching Holmes, who I feel sure at every opportunity suggests to the Sheikh that he ought to strike out a strong line for himsalf and cease leaning on and trying to please H.M .Gr. or the Political Agent, especial^ in matters that concern the immediate financial prosperity of hfes state.THE ATHENyEUM, per801.al pall mall, s.w. i. nfli I ' 29th April, 1932. My dear Dickson, You will have been as disappointed to receive, as v /e were to send, a telegram a fortnight ago saying that we did not wish at present to negot iate for a concession in Kuwait, and that we were withdrawing our geologists. For tactical reasons which I need not detail, it was necessary to send this telegram and to withdraw our geologists, who would in any case have been compelled by the heat to leave within the month. The information that we were getting was of a nature that would greatly interest any of our competitors and we were not disposed to make them a present of it. I do not mean you to deduce from this statement that the views that we formed regarding the prospects of commercial oil in Kuwait were hopeful, but (unlike Major Frank Holmes) v /e have interests in Persia and in Iraq through the I.P.O., and the physical world being what it is geo logical conditions in Kuwait may throw light on conditions existing below the surface in neighbouring countries and vice versa , and v /e are at this moment engaged in putting down a deep test in the hills south of Bushire, and our observations at Kuwait have to be correlated with what we are getting in that well. Thus looking at Kuwait, not merely from the local point of view of a possible small oilfield but as part of the geological problem of the countries at the head of the Persian Gulf, v /e are, or are likely to be, interested in the matter to the extent of not wishing entirely to abandon further research into the possibilities of Kuwait, though these are of necessity very speculative. I have no idea as to v/hether Frank Holmes and his American backers are pushing the Shaikh hard, or v/hether he is disposed to grant them a concession. If, hov/ever, you think fit, you might2. inform the Shaikh verbally that you have reason to think that this Company might be prepared to pay the Shaikh £2,000 sterling cash down in return for an exclusive option to prospect and survey Kuwait territory for the next two years, or if the Shaikh thinks this too long, for the next eighteen months, i.e., covering two cold weather seasons. This would give time for us to complete our deep well tests on the other side of the Gulf and to correlate the information that we have or may obtain at Kuwait with the work that is being done both in Iraq and- in Persia. I do not think that the Company would be disposed to go higher than £2,000, nor to commit ourselves to any specific undertaking as to drilling, etc., and at the end of the period of this ootion, the Shaikh would of course be perfectly free to take whatever action he thought fit elsewhere. Will you drop me a line to let me know whether the Shaikh is disposed to consider favourably some such arrangement. If so, I would be prepared to recommend strongly to the Chairman that we should take action on these lines. I am only venturing to trouble you personally in the matter in view of our conversations last summer and of the fact that we have no repre sentative at Kuwait whom we could entrust with the duty of making these preliminary enquiries. With all good wishes. Yours sincerely, ^ T Vv I Sox Lt.-Col. H.R.P.

I enclose for your information a copy of a private letter addressed by Sir A* Wilson to )ttck8on 9 in which you will see that he stetes that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company might be prepared to pay the Shaikh £ 2,000 cash down in return for an exclusive option to prospect and survey Kuwait territory for the next two years, or at any rate 18 months. i I returned from Basrah a few days ago via Kuwait in order to get an opportunity to discuss the oil question with the Shaikh and Dickson. I only had a couple of hours on shore and the discussion was rather hurried, but serred a useful purpose. Dickson then showed me the letter he had received from #ilson, and told me that the Shaikh was not prepared to accept this offer, and 1 must say I think he is t- quite right. The dealiiigs of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with these Arab Principalities have in the p^st been un« ^ satisfactory. In his despatch No. 16/205-3 ol 23th March 1924 the Political Resident reported that they were un popular on the Arab coast and expressed the view that their principle object in seeking concessions was to prevent other companies from coming in, but that this was not fair to the Shaikhs and that they should be given a specific time ^ within which to carry on negotiations f failing which other concession ...

J»ow we get Wilson's letter in which again no request is made for a concession, and the Shaikh not unnaturally regards It simply as an attempt to ride off Holmes and Company, and 1 think he is probably right. anyhow a private letter from Vaioon to j^ick&amp;ou hardly seems to me a particularly dosirable manner of dealing with this quostlon, or one which Is calculated lo Inspire «.he Shaikh with confidence in the intentions of the company. On the one i»nd we hare Holmes, *ho presents the Shaikh with considerable cash presents, motor cars, wireless, euc. and definitely asks for a concession and Is obviously armious to obtain one, and, fudging from Bahrain, to exploit it when he has ...•r has got it, and on the other hand the Anglo^Peroian Oil Company, who hare for years past shilly-shallied and now first of all inform the Shaikh that they do not desire a concession and then in a very informal manner say that they will give him £ 2,000 for an exoluaiTe option to prospect and surrey though no request is made for any formal concession. In these circumstances it seems pretty obrious that they do not mean business but are merely anxious to ride off their rivals* I have thought it as well to let you know of this demarche and I am convinced that unless the Anglo~Persian Oil Company come forward formally with a definite request for a concession and some sort of indication that if granted they will exploit it I do not think there is the least chance of the Shaikh agreeing to any proposals from them« Shaikh said that on the one hand he did not wish to get into the bad books of His Ifajesty^ Government, but on the other hand he did want Money* Holmes, I understand, is preparing a revised draft concession and as soon as the Shaikh receives it he will send it to us to be vetted, and he assured me that any conditions that we put in he would certainly insist on, and he asked me to let him know definitely and clearly what we required* As regards the Sastern and General Syndicate, the /Is vl( AIR MAIL, Confldentlal &gt; D«0»Jlo»346-S of 1932.

He began by referring to .Vilaon's letter and I told him my views regarding it, with which I found that he was in general agree ment, and he told me frankly that their office out here had never thought that a proposal of that nature was in the least likely to be occepted by the Shaikh. I said that J thought the Shaikh was not unnsturally very dubious about their intentions and that it was essential if they wished to re^iin his confidence to come forward with a much more definite proposal. I then went on to say that I really saw no reason why the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should not come forward with a definite request for a concession on the lines of the Bahrain Concession. This would in the first instance not involve them in any considerable expenditure or commit them to anything definite. They could ssk for an exploration license for two years^ during which they would only Jaave to pay the Shaikh about £ 1000 a year and send some geologists round Kuwait. At the end of this period they could ask for a further extension as Holmes had done in Bahrain, and then they oould take out a prospecting license^ which again would only involve putting up one rig - a very small matter for a company like the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The dice were certainly loaded ...

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that Major Frank Holmes of the Eastern G-eneral Syndicate, proceeded to Bahrain via Basrah on Thursday 9th June. Before he left he called on me and said that he would not be absent for more than a week or ten days. 2 # Major Holmes appeared anxious about his draft oil concession which I forwarded to you recently, and urged me to find out from you whether it had gone on to London or not. He seemed somewhat worried also about Mr. Chisholm^of the Anglo Persian Oil Company^ recent flying visit, of which he had full details. 3. of iiie Anglo Persian Oil Company arrived by air from Abadan and stayed at the Agency. 4. Mr.Gass had two interviews with His Excellency the Shaikh, each lasting about 1^ hours, on 10th and 11th June respectively. At both of these I was present and acted as interpreter. 5. Although much useful ground of an oil nature was covered, the talk principally dealt with and centered . fltl li *. On Friday lOlh June Mr.Gass, Deputy Director-Z- centred round a message from Sir John Cadman who had autho rized Mr.Gass to proceed to Kuwait and offer Rs20p00/- per annum to the Shaikh for an immediate and exclusive concession to survey and explore Kuwait territory for a period covering 3 years. 6. Mr.G-ass who pressed the Shaikh very hard, intimated that he would be prepared to offer an extra two or three thousand rupees over and above the Rs20000/-mentioned above, if only he would accept the proposal, also that he was empowered to come to immediate terms. 7. The Shaikh who listened patiently to every thing Mr.Gass had to say, before finally replying turned round and asked me if I had any^message' from His MaJesty^s Government ordering him to accept Mr.Gass's proposal. When I replied that I had not, he the Shaikh told Mr.Gass that he was quite unable to agree to his ofrer which was prac tically the same as the one recently made privately by ^ir Arnold .Tilson. If however his company would put forward a draft oil concession, on the lines of that submitted by Major Holmes that is to say embodying exploration, prospect ing and mining licences all in one, then he the Shaikh would be willing and ready to carefully consider it. The Shaikh emphasized that he wanted somettiing that he could place alongside and compare with the offer made by the Eastern General Syndicate (Major Holmes). He further made a point of warning Kir.Gass that his company must not take too long preparing such draft concession, as he could not wait beyond a reasonable period of time. 9* Mr.Gass I liiink was on the whole pleased with his reception and the turn the discussions took, and promised to report all that the Shaikh had said to London.

I a T n so sorry to learn that Col. Dickson was mistaken and that you are not going hone until the end of July, which will deny ne the opportunity of meeting you at ^.haiba in the early future. Unfortunately 1 am finding it exceedingly difficult to get away just at the moment but I do not think that the subject of Toweit oil development requires immediate discus sion with you, although I am very anxious to consult you before you go home and generally to place you fully au fait with our proposals regarding Koweit. The nosition at nresent, briefly, is this. I had two long interviews with the Sheikh in which I was very soon able to realize that our precipitous departure from H.E's territory last Anril -/ithout havin ^ given him adequate reasons to account for our rithdrawal, had created a very bad^imnres- sion and led to a complete misunderstanding. I explained to that it was due to a broad geological policy and that we now had a certain amount of reolorrical indorsation about r owe it but that it ras information which in itself was inconclusive and we were anxious to correlate it -dth the information we were obtaining from actual drilling in Kuh-i-Mund and the unique -^ecloglcal information which we have accumulated over many years of the whole of the surround!ag country. - added that this was the reason we had asked for a short extension of the oeriod, to give us the onpo^tunity to conclude our research, and I offered the Sheikh ^5.20,000 n.a. ( and was( 2 ) quite Dre^ared to exceed by a few more thousand rupees my discretion to go to this figure) if he was disposed to accept this offer. T {.S. however declined the nronosal and informed me that he desired a comprehensive concession to he submitted to him for his consideration and in order.that he could comnare the terms with those which had been offered by the Eastern General Syndicate, starting with a reception I can only describe as most courteo is but distinctly aqe, I hone I a r n right in believing that I le^t Koweit vith the impression that this atmosohere had at least been converted into one of 'reat cordiality; I.E. vas kindness Itself and so good as to express a message of friendliness to the Company to be com municated to Sir John Gadman. Upon my return I renorted the result of these discussions to London and have just received their cabled reply, which is to the effect that in deference to the Sheikh's vishes in this matter, Sir John Cadman has ^iven immediate instructions for a comnrehensive concession to be nrenared and submitted to the Sheikh and for arrangements to be made to open negotiations personally with the Sheikh, in terms of the draft concession. I enclose a cony of the letter in which I have communicated this decision to H.E. through Col. Dickson. At the conclusion of my interviews with the Sheikh I had explained to him that it would take some time to prepare a comprehensive concession and ' r .E. replied that he appreciated this point and was quite prenared to leave the matter open for a reasonable period. The document is being nrenared and translated at home and I shall of course have to have the translation care fully checked here. 7e shall do everything nossible not to keep K.S. waiting, and T feel nretty confident that we s^all have the document in his hands within 2 months and I do trust that this will meet with .E's approval.

The Arah is not lilce tbe Persian, niid dis likes if anything unnecessary ombroidery and fullsome phrases. In fact one of tho ret'sons why he hates the Persian, is the fullsome wording of Persian documents, which he always suspects are intended to cover traps. 0 # Don f t forget too that your most important role Is to try and convince the Shaikh that you mean to get to work at once. If you get your ooncersion. Holmes regularly rubs it In that the A.P.O.C # s policy is only w a dog In the manger one' and that even now you are working feverishly to keep him and his 'crowd' out of Kuwait, and that that done, you mean to sit still and do notMng more. This form of propaganda you must be prepared to combat with all your power. I was only told yesterday by Dr.Miss Barney of the Mission here tbat at a dinner party which she attended on 27th June 1932, 15ajor Holmes loudly held forth to the members of the Mission in this strain. g # The latest Is that Holmes has suddenly decided to leawo for the United Kingdom having heard that the fate oi his draft concession will probably be decided in London in direct consutation between His Majesty's Government and his company.

This is a tip for ycu. 10. 3)urlng his absence a geologist called Miller {who arrived yesterday from Bahrain) will conduct a rough surface survey over Kuwait territory, to try and corelate Bahriln and Kuwait geological conditions.

I asked the Shaikh yesterday if he had accord ed his sanction to such work and he replied in the af 'irmiuive but that he had ^orbiader &amp;11 'und^r the surface' exploration. i t@ 11, I myself have to be careful, outwardly at any rate, to appear 'neutral' as knowing my man, any show of favouring your company too wd6h 9 would be liable to throw tJie Sbalkli even more into the anas of Holmes# 12, Holmes told me last night, that he felt quite certain now that would get the concession through and would shortly com© back with 16 European drillers* I felt inclined to reply with the dictum about ths unwisdom of 'counting your chickens etc'. 13 # I am sending a copy of this to Sir Hugh Biscoe if you don f t mind as I am anxious for him to know every move in the gamD* 14 # fhe presence of Haji Abdulla I think will be useful thou^i I kno%'7 nothing about his political 'acumen'.

My dear Sir Hugh, Thank you very much for your letter of the 28th June, i note that you share my view that there is no Immediate necessity for a personal discussion on the Koweit position.

After the last plane had left i confirmed that Major Holmes was a passenger on board and i have telegraphed this information to my London Principals. l am surorised to learn that Major Holmes has stated that he has heard that his concession will probably be fixed up at home by direct negotiation between H.M's Government and his Company, as i should 'lave thought that such a course, or even a reference to such a course, would be likely to offend the amour propre of the Sheikh. But this is higher politics of which i am of course in complete ignorance. i note that you expect to be home about the 9th of August and 1 am quite sure they will be very pleased in London to have the opportunity to discuss the details of the Concession with you. Vith kindest regards, Yours sincerely. Lieut-Col. Sir nugh Biscoe, K.B.E., I.A., The Hon'ble The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e.FerBomal and Confidential . The Hesidency, B ub hire, llth July 1932. \\ Thank you for your letter No. OjU/ , 743 of the 4th July# You say that you are eurprieed to learn that Holme a stated that he had heard that hie concesBion would probably be fixed up at home by direot negotiation between Hie Majeaty 'b Government and his Company; ¥^iere|he heard this from I do not exactly know, but the statement ie not quite correct. The position is as follows. Some time ago he submitted a draft conceasion which was sent to the Government of India, who put it before their expert, the Director of the Geological Survey. The latter^ criticiBmsjof the draft concession were exceedingly scathing, and he pointed out that the terms offered to the Shaikh were such as would not be accepted for one moment by the Government of India. These criticisms were not communicated to Holmes neither was any action taken on them, but recently he submitted another draft concession, the terras of which, I think, were even more exorbitant in sorae respects than those of the previous one. I have therefore pointed out to His Majesty's Government that the Shaikh of course ic a child in such matters; that it is incumbent upon us to pro tect hie interests; and that neither Dickeon nor i possess any technical knowledge on the subject of mining leases. I therefore suggested that they should have the draft concession/-2- © conceaBion ••vetted - by a mining expert in London, and BhouXd then disoueo it with the Company on the clear underetanding that any agreement arrived at in London would in no way be binding on the Shaiich, who would be at liberty to modify the terme if he ea,? fit: in faot our role in this matter would be that of a eolicitor who is aBked to draw up some document for a client; he advises the client as to whether the agreement is in order and the conditions and terns suitable t and then if the client chooses to give more liberal terms he does so with his eyes open. There is tiierefere no question of offending the amour propre of the ahailch, but merely of obtaining for him the best possible advice in a hi^ily technical matter of great importance to the future wellfare of his State before he finally commits himself. If, as I hope, your Company alao seek a concession from the Shaikh, 1 consider that we should also obtain teohnical dy adviccjregarding it before it is the shaikh. 1 hope this has fcade the matter quite clear. I think it is improbable that I shall be able to get away on the 4th August, but will let you know later so that if you so desire you can inform your London office. I enclose a letter from Chick, formerly Vice-Coneul at Bushire, and subsequently Consul at Shiraz and now Consul«- Qeneral at Salonica, for Haidar Khan of Bandar Kig.

Ir / Reference your telegram Ho 9 497 dated the 16th August 1932* I have the honour to report that Mr.ChishoLa of the Anglo Persian Oil Company Ltd., arrired in Kuwait by oar from Basrah on Sunday 14th August* He brou^it with him a copy of the A.P.O.C. Draft Oil Agreement for submission to His Exoellanoy the Shaikh. 2. On the same evening (14th August) Mr.Chisholm called on the Agency and gare me a letter frcm the Deputy Manager, A.P.O.C* Ltd., Abadan, which enclosed a spare copy of the Agreement for my use. 3. On the morning of the 15 th August I returned Mr.Chisholm 9 s call, and went throu^i the Agreement carefully with him paragraph by paragraph, adrising him to make a certain number of small though to my mind important alterations, before he submitted to the Shaikh. Mr.Chisholm said he was not empowered to do thii but would report my suggestions to Mr.Oass the Deputy Manager on his arriral on 19th August in Kuwait. In the meantime he proposed handing the agreement as it stood to the Shaikh thethe following day, and would explain that any little points wfcioh did not appear necessary or were not liked he, Mr»ClLishola 9 felt sure they could be adjusted to his liking as soon as Mr.Qas^ arrived. On thB same afternoon at 4r«30«p 9 m 9 i.e. 15th August, I took Mr.Chisholm to oall on His Sxcellaicy and present his credentials. % On 16th August at 9.a # m. Mr.Chisholm aoooaapanied by Mr.Williamson of the A.P.O.C.Ltd., again called and presented the Draft Agreement to ihe Shaikh. This time and on xay advice they acted alone. &amp;• On the 17tSb. August at 9«a»m. I had occasion to sail on the Shaikh about other business f and casually asked how he liked the new draft agreement of the A.P.O.C. His reply was that he IhoueJit it a good one, rery and was/pleased with its brevity, but that he had only so far been able to glance at it* He must be given time to compare it side by side with that submitted by Major Frank Holmes before disoussing matters further. He remarked tba t one of the hardest tasks that ley before him undoubtedly in deciding which of ttoe two agreements was best for his State, was the fact that, Majer Holmes had been and was a great personal friend of his , that he had known him for 12 years^ ebad It was upto him as an Arab to remember that loyalty to his friends, 'Wuffah' had to be considered, and was not to be lightly put aside* I replied that X admired such sentiments myself, and hoped he would always hold to them, but that when all was said and done, he had his State to think of, those who come after him. This must be his first consideration. My cue of eourse all along is to play the part of a neutral. In the course cf further conversation the Shaikh mentioned that he did not like the wording of Article 11 line 13 to end of sentence. This was one at the points suggested by me for amission, to Mr.Ghisholm. I was able to say tha u I felt sure the Company would modify or remove the^7 -3- the objeotioneJble words if he wlebed., &amp;• He then enquired what I thou^it was meant \ry guards ('Haras'), earlier in ttie same Article 11* I told him that the Intention was that there should be watchmen to look after buildings t oil tanks t and oompnay's belongings ' generally, as was done at Abadan. He seeioed quite satisfied* Apparently Mr.Chiaholm had in presenting the agreement informed the Shaikh also that the guards would be under a reliable maa of good standing, and appointed by h;Lm &gt;( tfae Shaikh l* This had pleased the Shaikh very much it seems. 3^ vincidentally this had foxmed one of the suggestions made by me to Hr^Chisholm the previous day. 9. Lastly Mr.Chisholm told me last ni^tit that in presenting the draft to the Shaikh all money entries through out had been given in rupees, and not in pounds. Actual figurei being entered in round numbers and not the exact equivalents of sterling. This too was done on my advice to bring it into line with Major Holmes* draft agreement and to viable the Shaikh the more easily to compare the two. 10. Another alteration in the draft presented to the Shaikh was made in Artiols 5. for whereas in the copies sent to you and myself, it mentioned that the ccmpany would jay the Shaikh a royalty of tl per 5 tons of petroleum extractsd, the Shaikh's copy read per ton. 11 • I ccme now to the copgaents w hich I have to make on the Draft Agreement itself. In the main X think it is a good plain and straightforward agreement, and for this reason I like it. Its chief virtue lies in its brevity , which to the Arab mind is all to the good. It avoids vague legalities and contentious phrases which only make a man, especially an Arab, suspicious, and leaves room for the addition of any safeguards that either the Shaikh or His Majesty's Government might desire to have added. It avoids the fault of Major Holmes 1 agree- nwn* whloh g^nsrally .placing, I think was too long. V(UD 12. As regards the question of jurisdiction * It may be thou^it at first sight that too little mention has been made of this point* Bat when one realizes that the A.P.O .C. is a British Company and will aut&amp;natioally hare to abide by the provisions of the Kuwait Order in Council of 1925 y I think we need not worry ourselres much about this. Mr.Ohisholm is diocussing this point with me 9 said that any idea of ^ laperiiaa In Imperio ' 1 was repugnant to ^v. his company and that their policy was always to work in con junction with and not against local authotity* IS. Should the Shaikh like to strengthen his authority in the matter 9 for ia8tance 9 of the guards or watchmen which the company propose to engage 9 all he has to do is to say so 9 and I have no doubt that the A.P.O.C. will do Iheir best to meet his wishes# 14. It must be remsnbered moreover that the Shaikh is very enlightened in such matters, and realizes with us, that while safeguerd*|i^ 9 are highly desirable where there is a chance of a Foreign concern getting into his State 9 such safeguards are nothing like so important, when dealing with a purely British concern working.in his State 9 which in itself « is under Brlti sh Government s protection* o 15. Below will be found some alterations and omissions which I suggest should be made in the agreement botSi to safeguard the Shaikh and the A*F«O.C* 9 and alse to avoid future misunderstandings. Most of them I have already verbally mentioned to Mr.Chisholm of the A.P.O.C. and found him sympathetic. (a) In article X. line 3 after word 1 v hereto w insert following ^Xnoluding the Islands of Mascan (Maschan) 9 Auhar, Kubbar 9 v^aru and Um A1 Maradin, which are not shown on the map 9 and which appertain to Kuwait. &gt; (b) Article I. line 3. Portion in brackets to read ('excepting only the area withinwithin the present Town Wall of Kuwait, as well aa skrlmes, saored buil(ilrigs and graveyards') and the existing wording to be omitted# (0) Artiole IV# Line 6# Portion in brackets to read, as in (b) above, (d) Artiole V. Line 7# The amount of £2000 (or Rs E5000/- in Shailch f s draft) seems to me rather small if read in conjunction with Article XII, as there is a chance of this amount only bein^ paid for a period of 5 years, i.e. till the 1941 declaration, should for instance the oampany find oil during the w drillin period^, and not chose to exploit it comeroially. I think the amount might with advantaga be raised to £3000 (Ra40000/- ) and will show that the company are prepared to penalize themselves if they prefer to sit^tA^ht on knmn oil 9 *. (e) Article V. Line 9. After word '•petrollum^ add in brackets '(i .e. of crude oil as it canes out of the ground)' which the eompeny shall etc, etc. I suggest this as to an Arab the word petrolium is rather vaguw. It mi^it also be read later to mean '•refined petrol' for ins ton co. (f) Article VT. Hne 9. Aft or word 'hereunder' insert 'Provided always that the water supply of the local inhabitcnts, and noaaad population, who may be dependent on same is not endangered'. (g). Artiole VIII. Line 5. After word 'employees '. Insert 'provided again that the existing water rights and requireiuents of those dependent on local supplies is not in any way endangered'. (h) Article IX. Line 3. After word 'all', insert word 'unoccupied'. (1) Article XI. Line 7. After word 'standing' insert words ' appointed by the Shaikh'. (J) Artole XI. Line 13, After word 'territory', delata words 'In the arent of shaikhLi J I I ■ lUV Shaikh' at end of sentence* (k) Article XIII, Line 4« After word 'Company' add sentence 'by which is meant any British Company registered in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireiland, having as Chairman and Board of Directors Englishmen resident In the British Isles.

(ri/ 'tic.l© Line 7« After word 'Umpire' Insert 'who shall be the Political AgBwrt; Resident In the Persian Gulf' deleting from word^ho' to word arbltra- (n) The following 3 new Articles might with some advantage be added between the present Article XV and XVI, (1) The Shaikh* s flag and no other shall be used on land by the company. (11) Neither the company nor Its employees shall interfere In any manner with the politics of the Shaikh's Dominions, or with his subjects.

Oil Company Ltd., Abadan, duly a^ived by air at Iluwai t on 20th August having been prevented from cor.iing on 19th as anticipated. 2. Mr.Grass called on me the sane day, and after wards went round and saw the ohaikh. 3o At this interview which took place in the presence of Hr^Chlsholm and Ilaji Abdullah. Williamson, both of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, the Lhaikh took up the atti tude that he was averse to even entering into any discussion of the Draft A.-.C.C. -gresiBnt, until he had had tine to study it carefully, and had got an expert to compare the Arabic and English copies properly. In other words he said that he refused to be^rushed'. 4o .Tien Lir.Jass explained that he had gone to very great trouble to get their Head Cf'ice in London to prepare the draft quickly and in record time, at the e::--resc ^Ish of himself, the Jiaildi, who on his last visit,/ V -3- ^ visit, had Mi self strongly urged haste, on the plea that llajor Hoi:les , draft a^ree lent was already in his hands, and t if fl.e Allglo Torsi an Oil Company wished to coiapte they mast hur/y up also, the Jhalkh changed his tactics ard explained that the truth of the natter was iiiat he, tl:e Shaikh, was not at liberty to discuss 1he details of the draft agreement, or even put forward his own proposals until such time as the Hon'ble the Political Resident, through the Political —^ent had intirated that the wording and details of the draft agreement had his approval and that of His Lla je sty * s G -ove rnment. 5 # Ilr.G-ass reported the substance of the above conversation to me and gave it as his opinion that the Shaikh was trying -to delay matter till such time as Major Holmes arrived. I agree with this view, especially as the Shaikh in subsequent conversation said -hat Lla J or Holmes was arriving onolst August fron London. 6. Nevertheless LIr.G-ass was pble to clepr up two important points at his interview with the Shaikh, even though general discussions were* taboo. These concerned article XI of the draft agreement and certain points concerning whieh I had already commented in my letter No.140 of 18th August (paragraph 15 (i) (j)J Ilr. Gass was firstly able to assure the Shaikh that not only would the Qommander of the guards be under his the Shaikh's orders but also the guards themselves would be appointed by the Shaikh. Secondly he was able to say that the offending sentence in line 15 article XI beginning after word 'territory^ to end, would be deleted. This was satis factory. 7# After the Shaikh, myself and l-Ir.Gass had given dinner parties to each otLer, :.j?.Gass informed me that there was no point in his staying in Kuwait any longer as it was clear that until the Hon'ble the PoliticalPolitical Resident told the Jhailch. that he could -o -The?d t and discuss the draft agreement wit?, himself and Er•Chisholm, the latter would continue to^ dir: his heals 'in, and not cooperate. 1-r.Gass thereupon left by air for Abadan on the morning of 22nd. august. 8# Actually befoce his departure Lr.Gass called on ne and we discussed the various mi r alterations and additions which I had suggested in my letter iro.140 of 18th August. Ilr.Gass was most helpful and said th at he would see that all my sux e stions were, embodied in the draft agreement next given to the Shaikh, except for (d) and (e) and (k). As regards (c.) he would have to refer my xrapc suggestion to London though he himself was quite sympathetic and saw my point. As regards (e) instead of my suggestion (in brackets} he would use the term after the word 'petro- founc and vjon , etc. This was the technically correct expression to use and meant all oil brou^it to the surface, (excluding a minimum of waste mtter). * As regards (k) he said he would add to my suggested sentence a clause to the effect that the majority of votes would be held in Dngland. ^ I understand tlB.t Llr.Chisholm will call on you, on Friday 26th August , to explain tiie situation in all its aspects, but in order to enable the Anclo Persian Oil Company to rT get on with' their negotiations, I with the ohaikh, which are now held up, it seems to me to be very necessary that you should give their draft agreement your preliminary 'blessing' air authorise me to tell the Shaikh that you approve of it as far as it goes, and have no objection to his opening formal discussions with the Anglo Persian Oil Company's representatives, so-4- yU'! so that they can bring their draft agreerent up to the stace at whioh i .ajor Holmes has been able to bring his - i.e. to loG l 0 ,, 0 ,' 1 .—2_!L__l2&gt; and embodying all sug estions that the Shaikh has to make.

Note of a meeting which took place at the Goloniai Office on the 5th of August 1932, to discuss the procedure to he adopted in connection with applications o^ the Astern and General Syndicate Limited, and the Anglo-tersian Oil Company for an oil concession in Kumit. The following were present Mr. J.E.W. Flood (In the Chair) ) Colonial ) OX 11C 6 • Mr. S.I. James &gt; Mr. C .W. Baxter ) Mr. G.F.A. Warner ) Oilice. Mr. J .G. Laithwalte India Office. Mr. P.O. Starling Petroleum Department. Captain H.R.G. Moore Admiralty. kir. glood explained that it was desired to arrive at some agreed conclusion as to the method of procedure to he adopted in connection with the applications of the Eastern and General Syndicate and the i -aiglo-Persian ^il Company. As regards the former, a short drafL. concession had heen submitted hy the Syndicate. This draft was generally on the lines of those already submitted which had already heen severely criticised by the Government of India and the Resident In the Persian Gulf. Sir Hugh Biscoe had suggested that an entirely new draft should be prepared in London for discussion with the syndicate, and the Colonial Office had asked the Petroleum Department whether they would undertake the work. As regards the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, it was understood that the Company were preparing a draft concession lor subiuission to the Shaikh and Sir Hugh Biscoe had suggested that this draft should first be 'vetted' in London. Mr. Starling/(g) I$v Mr. §t^.rllng explained that apart from the fact that his department was very short-handed at the moment they felt sure that it would not he good tactics to prepare a new draft for the Syndicate. If the syndicate were presented with a draft which they were told would he acceptable to His Majesty^ Government, they might possibly agree to its terms and we should find it difficult to keep the field open for a reasonable offer hy the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. As regards the latter, Mr. Starling said that the draft concession was ready and had already gone out to the Shaikh. He (Mr.Starling) had only been given an opportunity to glance at the draft and could, therefore, make no comments on it, except to record that the portions relating to cash payments had been left blank. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company had made it clear that they were not prepared to let His Majesty's Government examine the draft in detail until it had been submitted to the Shaikh. Mr. Flood .asked whether there would be any objection to producing for the benefit of both Companies a statement of the essential provisions v^iich must be included in any concession granted by the Shaikh. After some discussion it was decided that it would be better to await the Shaikh's reactions to the proposals of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Mr. Baxter said that from the point of view of general policy the present would be a most inopportune moment at which to provoke another oil controversy with the United States of America. For this reason the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would almost certainly oppose strenuously any action which might bring about such a state of affairs, and it was, therefore, considered highly Important to show absolute Impartiality as oetween the two companies. ^ Warner/4 T Mr. Warner explained that the Americans were already suspicious of our actions in this matter. They suspected us of pushing the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the pretext of the Shaikh's alleged preference for a British company and of deliberately delaying negotiations with the ^ Eastern and General Syndicate in order to give the Anglo- Persian Oil Company time to formulate their proposals. It was agreed that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company must | put up a businesslike offer. This they were apparently doing and the Shaikh should shortly have an opportunity of comparing their concrete proposals with those of the Eastern and General syndicate. The course to be adopted by His iiajesty's Government in the future would clearly depend upon the nature of the respective proposals, but the Foreign Office representatives stressed the point that nothing should be done viilch might enable the Americans to accuse His Ifejesty's Government of bias In favour of the British company. Mr. Laithwaite thought that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's offer should be at least as good as the offer of the Eastern and General Syndicate in order to Justify an attempt on the part of His Majesty's Government to y Influence the Shaikh in favour of the foiraer. Captain Moore explained that the Admiralty's view was that both offers being equal, our strategic needs in the Persian Gulf weighed down the scales in favour of the British Company. He pointed out that the tenns of sir John Simon's note to Mr. Atherton of the 9th of April did not preclude our giving the preference to a proposal from another company, so long as that offer was at least as favourable from the point of view of the Shaikh as the proposal made by the Eastern and General Syndicate. Discussion/Discussion then turned on what, if any, action was desirable vis-a-vis the Eastern and General Syndicate. The suggestion was made that it might now he advisable to let the syndicate know the safeguards on which His Majesty^ Government would insist before letting American interests into Kuwait. Mr. Starling , however, deprecated such action at this stage as the new general oil policy of His Majesty's Grovernment had not yet been formally adopted and to disclose it in this case would be premature. He explained that it was first desired to ascertain from the Dominions whether they agreed to the change of policy decided upon for His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Colonies. It was agreed, however, that something must be said to the Eastern and General Syndicate. The recent correspondence had left them with the expectation that the next step would be a discussion in London of their recent draft concession in the light of any criticisms made by the various interest Departments, the Government of India and the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and it was necessary, therefore, to let them know officially that no definite conclusion can be reached on their draft concession until the Shaikh has had an opportunity of comparing their proposals with those of the Anglo-PeiBlan Oil Company which, it is understood, are shortly to be submitted to the Shaikh. It was also agreed that the Resident In the Persian Gull' should be informed of the position as regards both applications. Mr*—ffiarling said that the Petroleum Department would be willing to compile a statement embodying the criticisms of His Majesty's Government and the Indian Grovernment on the Syndicate's latest draft concession. Diis/This could 'be sent out to the Shaikh for his inloimation, hut should not he communicated to the Syndicate at this stage. The conclusions of the meeting may, therefore, he sunmarised as follows;- (1) That no decision can he taken r egaraing the Eastern and General Syndicated draft concession until the tems of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's draft have heen disclosed, and the Shaikh's reaction thereto are known. (2) The Petroleum Department will prepare a statement of criticisms of the Syndicate's latest draft including the desiderata of His i^jesty's Government. This will not he communicated to the Syndicate until (a) the general policy of His fciajesty's Government as regards oil has heen announced; (fc) the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's proposals have heen examined. (3) The Eastern and General Syndicate should he sent an interim reply telling them that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have now submitted a formal application for a concession and notifying them that no decision can he expected regarding their draft concession until there has been an opportunity of comparing it with that of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. (4) The Resident in the Persian Gulf should he informed of the present position regarding hoth applications in the light of the decisions t aken at this meeting. wm1^1 P fi A F I» PERSIAN GULF. CONFIDENTIAL. Political Resident. Colonial Office, Downing Street. August 1932. Sir, With reference to my Confidential despatch No.2 of the 11th May and connected correspondence on the subject of Kuwait oil, I have the honour to inform you that the procedure to he adopted in connection with the applications of the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been under consideration by His Majesty's Government. 2. In paragraph 7 of his despatch No.21 of the 10th of June, the late Sir Hugh Biscoe suggested that an entirely new draft concession should be prepared for discussion with the Eastern and General syndicate. His tejesty's Goveriment are reluctant to adopt this suggestion in view of the infonnation which has been received that the Anglo- Persian Oil Company have already prepared a draft concession and have sent it to their local representatives for submission to the Sheikh of Kuwait. In these circumstances it would now appear advisable to defer any action until the Sheikh has had an opportunity of comparing the proposals of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with those of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and has given some indication of his wishes in the matter. 3. Meanwhile steps are being taken to compile a statement containing the observations of His Majesty's Government on the latest draft concession submitted by the Syndicate, a copy of which accompanied Sir Hugh Biscoe's confidential despatch No.20 of the 7th of June. These/K 0 W) These observations will take account of the criticisms offered 'oy the Government of India and sir Hu^h Blscoe, as well as the desiderata of His tejesty's Government as set out in the last paragraph of my confidential telegram No.3 of the 9th of Juay. When the statement is re^dy, it v.lll be lorwardad to you for your Information and for conanunlcatlon to the jheikh of Kuwait, but it will not be communicated to the syndicate until the proposals of xhe Anglo-Persian Oil Company have been m&amp;de known and have been examined both by the Sheikh and cy His Majesty's Government. 4.

You will recall that, in paragraph 3 of the letter from this Jffice of the 10th of May, it was pointed out that His Majesty* s Government did not consider that they could properly advise the Sheikh to give prior or preferential treatment to the Eastern and General Syndicate, hut held it necessary that any application for a concession which might he forthcoming from any quarter should he examined with a view to deciding which, if any, application would best serve the interests of the Sheikh and his principality. Information has now been received that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is submitting a draft concession for the consideration of the Sheikh of Kuwait, and it will therefore be necessary to defer a decision in the matter until the Sheikh has had an opportunity of considering the proposals of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and of comparing them with those made by your Syndicate, in the light of any criticians offered by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India.

AWGL0-PE**SIAN OIL CCWPANY LIMITED IN THE PHfcjSBNCE OF is . wrnrnmssm sWith reference to correspondence ending with my despatch Ho, 32 of the 16th August 1932, I have the honour to state that i have received a letter from the Political Agent, Kuwait, in which he states that representatives of the Anglo-fersian Oil Company, Mr* O-ass and Mr* Chisholm, have been having conversations with him and His isxcellency the Shaikh on the above subject, Mr* Chisholm of the Anglo-JPersian oil Company arrived lay air to-day from Basrah in the same connection i c \ and brought with him the revised copy of their proposed Agreement with His Jfijccellency of which I enclose a copy* 2m The position is that His Sxcellency, who on the occasion of Mr* Gass 1 last visit to Kuwait expressed a wish that the Anglo-i^rsian Oil Company draft agreement should be prepared as quickly as possible, has now taken up the attitude—as explained by Colonel Dickson — that ♦♦he, the Shaikh, wae not at liberty to discuss the detaili w of/ His Majesty^ Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colofiial^ Office, London.-2- m k ••of the draft agreement, or eren put forward his own pro- ••posale until auch time as the Hon^le the -Political ♦♦Resident, through the .Political Agentjhad intimated that 'the wording and details of the draft agreement had his H approTal and that of His Majesty^ Goverruaent M . Colonel Dickson goes on to say: *1 luiderstand that Mr. Chishola H will call on you on Friday, 26th August, to explain the ♦♦situation in all its aspects^ but in order to enable the 'Anglo--Persian Oil Company to ^et on with' their ♦♦negotiations with the ShaiJch, which are now held up, it ♦♦seems to Me to be rery necessary that you should giye 'their draft agreement your priliminaxy 'blessing' and 'authorise me to tell the Shaikh that you approyttbf it as 'far as it goes, and have no objection to his opening 'formal discussions with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company^ 'representatives, so that they can bring their Craft 'agreement up to the stage at which Major Holmes has been •♦able to oring bis, d«e« to its final state » and embody ing all suggestions that the Shaikh has to make'. 3* Mr# Chisholm has talked the matter over with me to-day and has expressed the same views as those put forward by Colonel Dickson, •hile realising that the attitude of the Shaikh must be somewhat anMoying to the Company, I do not see my way to carrying out Colonel Dickson's suggestion . As the Shaikh, having seen the Company^ draft agreement, has expressed a desire for His Majesty's Bovernment's approval, I think his wish should b^ complied with, and for the following reasons. Xn the proposal, draft there are - (a) Various articles (such as lios. 8 awi 11) which deal with comparatively unimportant matters, which the Shaikh is capable of deciding himself with the assistance of the/the Political Agent and the Political Resident in direct communication with the Company; (1)) Other articles (such as Hos. 1 9 6 and 15) which cover matters of political import ance to His Majesty^ Government; (c) Articles of a technical or financial nature (such as th»»e mentioned in articles 2 to 6, 7 and 9) regarding which the Shaikh is unable to look after his own interests without expert advice from His Majesty's Government, if the Shaikh d is cusses the draft with the Company before His Majesty's Govermient 1 s views are known, he may con cur with some of the articles under (b) and (c) which His Majesty's Government may later have to object to, either on their own behalf or on behalf of the Shaikh. An awkward situation would thus obviously arise for His Majesty's Government, vim a vis both the Shaikh and the Company. It seems better, therefore, to obtain His Majesty's Government's views firtt and then for the Shaikh to discuss the matter with the Anglo-jPeraian Oil Company. I have explained my point of view generally to Mr. Chisholm. I have the following comments to make on the proposed draft agreement. Article 1. Bander Shuwaikh should presumably be exempted as well as a possible cantonment area near Has-al -Ardh (vide Bushire despatch Mo. 42, dated 6th October 1930). The period covered by this article, which is apparently tor Exploration, is two years. This seems reasonable. The/-4- m s 3 ? The extent eovered Is the whole territory, tfo depth of boring 1 b laid down. I do not know whether this is an important point or not. I believe it is Bometimes customary to limit the depth of boring during the period of exploration to twenty feet. Article 2. Mo comments. Article 3. Here Prospecting apparently be gins« The period is two years. Mo areas are specified. Sometimes t 1 belie ye, a certain number of areas are chosen by the licensee. Article 4. Mining Lease apparently begins with this article. The period is for seTenty years. This may be considered too long but X understand that the shaikh himself asked for this period. There is no limit to the areas corered by the mining operations but as the total area to be corered is small, perhaps there is no objec tion to this. Article 5 . I have no comments to make on these figures which prima facie appear adequate. Mo provision is made for the revision of Royaliies or for giving the Shaikh facilities to chssk production by inspecting the Company^ books or otherwise. (The latter suggestion was made in the case of the Eastern and General Syndicate Bahrain Concession in the i'etroleum Departments letter Ho. Jtt 21-Part 2, dated 20th Junel932). Article 6. As the Anglo-jpsrsian oil Company are a British Company presumably in the case of war or other emergency His Majesty's Government could control the Company 1 s&gt; . I «» actlTitie8 f so a special provieo to coyer xiiis contingency will not toe necessary* Artiol&gt; 7.

On commencement of the i )rill -|J ing period the Anglo-Pereian Oil Company ■ agree to pa&gt; Hs. 2b 9 000* - ^ 1 ^ (tjon grant of Mining Lttase and suteatquent mMMX anni- ^ y veraary till oil is declared Anglo-jPerbian r ^ Oil Company pay K b . 2b,000. This as opposed. to Kaetern and General Syndicated R&amp;. 20,000 per annum. (c) When the dompany declare that oil has been found in commercially exploitable quantities they agree to pay the shaiich Hs# b0 9 000 plus a Royalty of Rs. 8-10-0 par ton subject to a minimum of Rs. 6b t 000 in the first year rising to Rs. 1,00,000 in the 5ra year, and the same sum annually thereafter. The Syndicate on the other hand offer a Royalty of Rs. 3*8«»0 per ton, but no annual payments. The syndicated offexj^s, in fact, a gamble or the mil quantity of oil produced. (d) As regards imports and exports the syndicate's offer is slightly the better. The Anglo- j?ersian Oil Company ask for their imports and exports to be duty free. The Syndicate agree to pay an export duty of on oil and its products as also duty on all articles foi the personal use of Ats employees. (•) It will be noticed that the Anglo-^Persian Oil Company guarantee to do drilling to 4000 feet while the Syndicate make no such promise.-7- 6. I would fee grateful if I could toe informed of the Tiews of Hie Majesty^ Government as soon as possible. The AngloePersian Oil Company are slightly nerrous that Major Holmes, who is due feuk in Kuwait at the end of this month, may effect a coup behind their backs* I do not think there is any danger of this but to make sure 1 am asking Colonel Diskson to make it quite clear to the Shaikh that he should give no reply to any offers that Major Holmes may make until he, the Shaikh, has had an opportunity of studying the Anglo-JPersian Oil Company's agreement when it is received back with His Majesty's Government's comments.

Ghisholm tells me that you would like working plans of a Squash court and it will be a pleasure to prepare these and in such a way that the construction cost can be kept to a minimum. 1 must however ask you to excuse a short delay, probably extending to a couple of weeks, as our Drawing office at the moment have their hands unusually full. i hope you will be visiting this part of the world before very long, and if you have the time and inclination to see round Abadan and pay a visit to Fields, l shall be only too pleased to arrange a short programme to suit your movements. with kindest regards, Yours sincerely.

Kuwait Oil , I have the honour to refer you to the last five lines of paragraph 5 of your despatch No # 36 dated 25th August to His Majesty 9 s Secretary of State for the Colonies, and also to the statement contained in the last six lines of paragraph 2 of Colonial Office letter dated 24th August 1932 (NO.Nil) to your address, forwarded to me ^\ ^ under your confidential No # 680.S. dated 17th September 1932. While it is obvious that these two letuers crossed each other in the post, it seems to me that the two statements referred to leave room for misunderstand ing. 3&lt; » I would suggest therefore, if you see no objection to such course, that His Majesty^ Secretary of State for the Colonies be told, that the attitude at present adopted by the Shaikh, is definitely to do nothing at all, much less give any indication of his wishes on the matter until he has been told exactly what His Majesty 1 s Governments views and desires are, in the case of the A .P .Q .c. concession and that of the Eastern and General Syndicate, specially. 4. Indeed the Shaikh informed me when I A^ 7- 2 - ' r y u. I conveyed to him the substance of paragraph 6 of your \V/ ^despatch No # 36 dated the 25th August to His Majesty 1 s A v : Secretary of State, that as far as he was concerned, he had neither examined the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft concession nor that of the A.P.O.C., except in most super ficial manner® Nor had he any intention at all of comparing the two or expressing any views on them, either to me or to the representatives of either of the rival companies* Mr.Chisholm tells me that he was told exactly the same thing by the Shaikh the day after my inter view with him, 5# Clearly the Shaikh's attitude is to 'give nothing away', until such time, as he has been given an indication of what His Majesty's G-overnment want. Then as I understand it, his idea is to go ahead independently of further advice from anyone, and himself decide to whom to grant the concession, always provided the company he favours, agrees to insert any clauses or conditions that His Majesty's Gk&gt;vemment would like ts added. In other words I rather guess that the Shaikh thinks it should be his own prerogative, to do the actual deciding as between the Eastern and General Syndicate and the A.P.O.C. Ltd. . My attitude of course is that already laid down for me by His Majesty's Government, namely one of the strictest neutrality. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.V JIu^L-c tjji- , i'7 /' '- P.P.. Papers iiave Deen sent to us on on] y for information. Copy may o be sent to P. A., Kuwait, for i n- -format ion. Ue need not take any further action pending a reference from Tondon of-Simla ana an indication of t'ne line taken there. I would point out tiov/ever tnat it is probaole that the Shaikh will refuse his consent to the reconnaissance. From 1923 to 192b the A -P.O.C. v/ere granted prior rights to other applicants for^concessions. They did not succeed in negotiating one chiefly because of failure ol agreement on the 'customs exempt- -icn 1 clause.
