Most of these goods are described as imports from India, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, to Manama and Muharraq in Bahrain. The file also contains complaint letters from both the Singer Sewing Machine Company in Baghdad and Electric &amp; Musical Industries Limited in England, regarding the adverse effect of Bahrain price controls on their profit margins. Also included in the file are the minutes of two meetings of the Bahrain Government's Food Control Committee about the removal of price controls and export restrictions, as well as new and amending Price and Export Control Orders for Bahrain in 1946 and 1947, drafted by the Political Agent. Most of the file correspondence is between the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Director of Customs and Port Officer for Bahrain (also acting in his dual capacity as Food Controller).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Economic Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Gwadur</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Tobacco</topic></subject><subject><topic>Price policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Import control</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000d9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000d9#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000d9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
