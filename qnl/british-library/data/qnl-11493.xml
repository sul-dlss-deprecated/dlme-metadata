In an ancient Manu- ratonfe fcript of two hundred years ftanding, I have minted ti found what follows: Melchtor was King of Nubia and Arabia ; B alt afar , of Goli and reitcoi Saba; Gafpar, of Tharjis, Infula-, and Grijola^ totliii[ where the Body of St.Tbomas lies, and chey i an Ij were afterwards by him made Biftiops, and (in(o;fuffered Martyrdom with him. )iir 6.

She has liberty to choole among them all,but none of them can court her upon pain of Death. The Nayres are very poor , few of them can maintain a Wife; and he that can need not fear another corrupting of her. For this Realbn three or four of them joyn to maintain a Woman, and that is their manner of Marriage: When one goes to the Wife, he leaves his Buckler at the Door, which is a fign one is within ; and if and- ther comes, he muft ftay. The Kingdom of Cochin was fubjeA to this Empire, though without paying Tribute, and made free by the Portugueles in requital, for the fidelity of the King Umramacoul , who Reigned when we firft dilbovered India, and expofed himfelf to utter danger of being ruined, rather than deliver up the Portugueles to Zamori. King Emanuel fent him a Crown of Gold by the Vice-Roy D.Francis de Al tneyda, which he received, lubmitting him- lelt as a Subjed: to Portugal , without any other acknowledgment; but is yearly pre- (ented with two pieces of Gold ; the one a Portugues, being a Coin worth 1 8 Ducats, on the oi January , the other on the day of the Epifhany , is a Cup worth 640, Thus much of the Empire of Malabar 7.

Being come back to Lisbon, and the King refolv d to make that Divifion of Governments, he named him for MoHomotapa^ with the addi tional Title of Conqueror of the Mines there. The great inducement to this Con- queft, was the Information and Experience of the vaft quautUjf of Gold foand, particu-fv Chap. XV.

The Doubt was, whether it were icj E ; proper for a Man who had been Gover- nour of a!I our Dominions in ylfia, and this Southern Part of Afmk to accept of this, * which was the leaft considerable part into which it was divided, but the danger and difficulty of it made amends for the greatr nefs. Three things prevailed with him to Tfflliil accept of it ; the hrft, that he was poor ; 'f/ffp the fecond, that he thought it no leirening nn to take a lefs Command in Obedience to his Prince ; and the third, that it was allowed n v him, in cafe the Viceroy and he met at Sea, their Power Ihould be equal in all refpeds. in l 3. in fine, Francit Barreto fubmitted to his King's Command, and the Dsfires of his Councry, and failed from Ltshn in Aprils m . 1569, as Captain, General, and Governor ^ of that Conqueft, with three Ships.

The King feeing he did not prevail by force of Arms, had recourfe to Policy. He caufed all the People and % Provifions to be withdrawn from the Towns and Country, lb that our Men fuffered ex- tream want till they came to Zimbaoe his Court, whence he was fled, and had forti fied himfelf in inacceffible Mountains. Vafca burnt the City, and marched on to Chkanga, the King whereof rather through fear than love, received him with exterior figns of Affection, and gave him free paflage to the Mines. Our Men marched to them, many believing they fliould gather Gold by hand- fuls; but feeing the Natives with much dif ficulty gathcrM but little in a long time, and not being expert at that work, and thaE to make any thing of it, more Men and Ma- lerids were requifite, they return'd the Z i way7he Portugues Afia.

MoncJaros as Direftor to the late Governor, who, only to follow his own extravagant Humour, lead him a-way fo dangerous and tedious. Vafc» returned to Quiteyve, and that King did now for fear what he refufed before, permitting the Portuguefes to march to the Mines of Mamnnaf, only upon con dition they fhould pay him Twenty Crowns yearly. Vafco pafTed thence to the Kingdom of Chicova, bordering upon Mommtapato the Norward along the Inland. The caufe of undertaking this iMarch was, the Account he had of rich Silver Mines. Having eif camped, he ask the Cafres for the Mines^ and they feeing it was in vain to refift, and fearing the difcovery of the Mines would be their Ruine, fcattering fbme Ore far enough from the Mines, fhewed it, telling them there they were. 4.
