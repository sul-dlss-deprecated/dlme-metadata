The 23rd of December, 1947. To His Excellency Shaikh Abdulla bin Qasim A1 Than!, C.I.E., Ruler of Qatar. After compliments, I am instructed by the Hobble the Political Resident to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty*s Government has, for some time past, had under considera tion the boundary which should delimit your Excellency*s rights in the bed of the sea lying between the territory of Your Excellency and that of His Highness the shaikh of Bahrain. Apart from any other considerations the operations of the oil companies in Your Excellency’s and His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain's territory make such a delimitation necessary. 2. I am, therefore, to forward herewith for Your Excellency's information a copy of a map showing the line (from point 'M* to the “Bahrain Light Vessel”) which, His Majesty's Government considers, divides in accordance with equitable principles the sea-bed aiore- said* This is a median line based generally on the con figuration of the coast-line of the i^anrain main island and the peninsula of Qatar. 3. With the exceptions noted below His Majesty's Government will, in future, regard all the sea-bea lying to the west of this line as being under the sovereignty of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and all the sea-bed lying to the east of it as being under the sovereignty of Your Excellency. This decision covers the sea-bed only and not the waters above it and is without prejudice to existing navigation rights. / 4. The ...../ 7.

After a full examination of the position under international law, His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that these shoals should not be considered to be islands having territorial waters. (ii) Hawar Island, the islands of the Hawar group and the territorial waters pertain ing thereto and delimited again in accord ance with the usual principles of inter national law. These islands and their territorial waters are shown on the map enclosed by the line A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K and L. As this delimitation will, however, leave a narrow tongue of water (formed by the points M, J, and I) pertaining to Qatar it has been decided to alter the line H, I, J, to H, P, Q, thus exchanging an equal area P I 0 for 0 J Q, It should be noted that Janan Island is not regarded as being included in the islands of the two Hawar group. 5, The points mentioned are defined as follows:- ^Position .

Central Mining and Investment Corporation &amp; Cuperior Oil Company who have been granted concession by the Shaikh of s atar in the subsoil underlying the Persian Gulf waters which lie*within his (the Shaikh of ^atar's) sovereignty. I should say that the sea-bed between Bahrain and .^atar has on no day been under the sovereignty 1 of the Shaikh of ^atar and that I do not accept that. Secondly, what confirms this is that there exist some possessions belonging to Bahrain subjects the right in the disposal of which vested in us and in our subjects, without the Ruler of ^atar or his subjects having any control over them.? Thirdly, when the Company wanted to install bouys between Bahrain and Zikrit it was we who granted the permission, which apart from the numerous reasons and conclusive proofs, establish our right in the sea-bed between Bahrain and *atar. Proofs adduced by us and by our subjects have already been filed with you. I am fully confident that the right is on our side and clear to all in the Gulf.

It was constituted in accordance with the terms of the Oil Con cession granted by the Shaikh of Qatar to the Anglo Persian Oil Company Ltd., in order to determine a dispute between His Excellency the Shaikh of Qatar and the Oil Company concerning the interpretation of the terms of the Con cession Agreement. Furthermore in accordance with uni versal international practice His Majesty's Government regard the high seas (i.e., the seas outside the limits of territorial waters) as free so that no claim to such seas lying between Bahrain and Qatar can be recognised by His Majesty's Government. The decision of His Majesty's Government of which His Highness was informed in my letter No.C/1226, dated the 23rd December, 1947, referred to the delimitation of the sea-bed lying between Bahrain and Qatar.

Shaikh Abdullah bin Qaain al rhAni » ^uler of Qatar, entered into a written ai^eement irith the Anglo-z ersian Oil Conpany, Limited, whereby he panted to that Company certain rif^hte in the terms set out in the various Articles of that agreement. The First Article of the Agreement expressed that the Shaikh granted to the Company, in virtue of the agreement and under conditions that were specified later, # the sole right throwzftout the Principality of Qatar to explore, to prospect, to drl)l for and to extract and to ship and to export, and the right to refine and sell petroleum and natural gases, osokerlte, asrhalt and everything which ie extracted therefrom.' The Second Article bf the agreement provided that, subject to the eondltlons of Article 7 of the agreement, the Company could 'operate in any part of the State of Qatar as is defined below, but it will not operate on places such as religious lands, cemsterles, lands occupied by religious buildings, or by essential enterprise by their owners as may exist on the date of the signature of this agreement or any customary extensions of such religious lands or cemeteries or buildings as may be pointed out by the Shaikh. The State of oatar means the whole area over which the shaikh rules and which is marked on the north of the line drawn on the map attached to this agreement.' It was further specified that the period of the agreement should be 75 years from the date of its signature. The agreement contained in all twenty-two Articles. 2 . By Article 16 of the agreement it was provided that if any dispute should occur between the Shaikh and the Company in regard to the interpretation of the agreement or any matter arising therefrom or in regard to the engagements ebli^&amp;tory on either of the parties in accordance therewith, the disputeshould be referred to two Arbitrators, If no agreement could be arrived at for settling It by any other aethod, and that one of such Arbitrators should be appointed by the 3halfch and the other by the Comr&amp;ny* It was further provided that those two Arbitrators should thereupon appoint a third Arbitrator, but that If they were unable to agree upon the third Arbitrator within sixty days fro® the demand for arbitration, the third Arbitrator should be appoint* by H|S Majesty 1 s irolltical Heal dent, subject to the Shaikh approving of such third Arbitrator. finally it wae provided that the Award of Arbitration should be eonsietent with the legal principles familiar to civilised national that the decision of ths majority of Arbitrators should bs finals and that tha place of arbitration should bs Q^tar. 3 . In ths year 1946 ths Anglo-Perslaa Oil Company, Limited (which had, by then, changed Ifsnaae to that of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company# Limited) assigned Its rights and obligations under the agreement to Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited, and Petroleum levelopment (Qatar) Limited (hereinafter referred to as 'th* Company') is entitled and bound to stand in the place of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited for all the purposes of the agreement. 4. In the month of June, 19*9, * dispute occurred between H.I* Shaikh Abdullah bln Qasim al Than! and the Com^syay concerning the extent of the area that was subject to the rights granted by the agreement set out In Paragraph 1 f'bove (hereinafter referred to ae 'the Concession’)• pr®®*** questions that ars Involved in the dispute are set out below.

During the course of the hearing the shaikh's Arbitrator placed it on record that he did not dispute 1 - (I) that the Concession includes islands over which the Shaikh rules and which are shown on the map attached to the Concession if and so far as any suoh island lies to the north of the line drawn on the map, or (II) that the Concession includes any lakes and rivers of Qatar, whether shown on the map or not, if and so far as any suoh lake or river lies to the north of the aforesaid line.11 . mbject to wh*% in rooordod in Paragraph 10 abovo, the Coapany 1 ® Arbitrator and tba shaikh*• Arbitrator maintained oonfllotlng viewo upon the several queetione set out in Paragraph 9 above* the Company* e Arbitrator maintaining: that each of the five questions ou*?ht to be answered in the affirmative* while the Shaikh*s Arbitrator maintained that each of them ought to be answered in the negative.

He appears to have been put up tp this extraordinary conduct by Abdullah Darwish. The original approach in the matter was made through Salih, who was put in a very embarassing position by the Sheikh’s refusal, and the explanation of the incident may be nothing more than that Darwish is determined to oust Salih at all costs, and wishes to let the Company see that they will get nowhere while they try to deal through Salih* 4. Darwish is also encouraging the Sheikh to say that he does not agree with the findings of the Arbitartors, and will not accept them unless he is given the reasons for their decisions* In this he is supported by the Superior peojkle* 5* Superior have not yet begun to confide either in the Adviser or myself, and as you may suppose, my chief source of information in the matter id X Salih, who is bursting with rage against Abdullah Darwish. I have been able to cross check all this IdMtfexkxtanatxcKigi with the Adviser, Ahmad Mulla, Abdullah Darwish and others, and I think the position is substantially as I have outlined it. The Sheikh has not so far said anything to me about his relations with Superior, and is unlikely to do so unless I raise the question myself* Superior seem to be fully alive to the danger of letting themselves fall completely into the hands of the Darwish. 6. My view, in which the Adviser concurs, is that it ft would be far better if all the dealings of both Oil Companies with the Sheikh were conducted through his office, and the post of Representative were abolished. The present cut-throat com petition is going to get nobody (except Darwish) anywhere. The only problem now is to persuade the Sheikh, the two Companies and Salih* C.J. Felly Esq* OBE., H.M.

I have, as suggested, spoken to Sprague on the lines of the first two sentences of paragraph 2 In Hankey’s letter under reference. He replied that he could not give us any precise information as to whether the Company wish to drill for atleast a year, as before taking such decisions an extensive seismic survey and other exploration would be necessary. I must admit that I am slightly surprised at Hankey asking only for In formation about drilling as the previous correspondence seems to refer to exploration generally and this course is a much wider subject in which the Company are more likely to overstep the mark. Sprague admitted to me that in order to get the minimum of information they require they would probably be forced to extend a seismological survey considerably outside the concessional area and pointed out as a precedent the very large areas that have already been surveyed by Bapco. Incidentally, he informs me that the Jennings is proceeding directly up to Abadan to be fitted out for gravity meter work, and therefore this form of survey may begin as early as the 1st of September.

Mr. Robin Andrews, The Political Agent, The Political Agency, Manama, Bahrain. Dear Andrews, It is our understanding the proposed sovereign rights for His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrain in the areas of the Dibal and Jaradeh shoals are those portions of the shoals which are above the spring tide low-water level. It is further understood that in His Majesty 1 s Government’s opinion these shoals should not be considered islands having territorial waters. According to the Agreement from the arbitration between His Excellency the Sheikh of Qatar and the Petroleum Development Qatar ltd., His Excellency the Sheikh of Qatar was awarded the sea-bed or subsoil or any part thereof beneath the high seas of the Persian Gulf contiguous with such territorial waters as those of the mainland of the State of Qatar and those of any island over which His Excellency Sheikh Abdullah ruled at the date the Petroleum Develop ment Qatar Ltd. Concession was signed. It is our interpretation a part of the sea-bed or subsoil over which His Excellency the Sheikh of Qatar rules and over which we have gained a Concession adjoins those portions of the Dibal and Jaradeh shoals for which His Majesty’s Government proposes sovereign rights for His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrain. In order to plan our exploration program for our Concession we wish to know if His Majesty’s Government considers our interpretation to be correct. Also, if our interpretation is not correct, we wish to know His Majesty’s Government's opinion with the reasons for this opinion if possible. Further, we v.lsh to know if a map has been prepared to show what portions of the Dibal and Jaradeh shoals are included in the sovereign rights proposed for His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrain and, also, we would like to have a copy of such a map if one has been made.

I therefore informed Sprague that he could proceed with this survey which is due to start on the 27th of this month.

U 1 * .s Will you please refer to my letter No.C/R-383 of 22r4 July about Superior Oil Company’s operations? U 2 * I enclose a copy of a letter I have received ^ from Sprague containing certaim queries. I pr^ipes^, if you agree, to reply saying that his undjersl^anding of the position is correct. The only^oint that I am g not sure of is whether there h^s—been any ciiange in tha- £' . position about shoals havi^r^erritorial waters Agency letter No.C/1227 dr 23rd December^194?^ to the Ruler of Qatar (a copy of which was fo*&gt;w|frded to the Residency with Agency printed letter No.C/38 , *6f r 7th January, 1948), which is clearly the document seen by Sprague before he drafted the enclosed letter, it is stated that twa shoals cannot be considered as islands having territorial waters, but I seem to remember that there has been subsequent discussions on this question between the Admiralty and the Foreign Office, and I am not certain if the position has been modified in any way. I see from Sir Rupert Hay’s letter No.126-S of 18th January, 1947, that whereas no part of the Dibalsremains above high water level, there is a possibility that Jaradah might be considered as an island. ^ ^ -plZ/to. X 3. As regards the request in the last paragraph of Sprague’s letter, I am unable to find that there hes been any detailed survey of the shoals for the purpose of de fining the area covered by the rights of sovereignty claimed. # The most accurate map which we possess in the Agency seems to be the one referred to in Residency letter No.187/10/49^ of 10th September, 1949, but I doubt if the areas of the shoals are sufficiently accurately defined to satisfy the Superior Oil Company’s requirements. However, I am not sure if the area has ever been covered by H.M. Survey ships, if so, their charts should be able to supply us with suf ficient detail. 4. I was also asked verbally by Sprague at the time he £ gave me this letter if I could inform him on what basis these two shoals and the Hawar island were allotted to^ \ Bahrain rather than to Qatar. I presume that I can inform him on the terms employed in the final approv«iK^rafts forwarded under Residency letter No.187/6/49^of 20th April, 1949, that as His Majesty’s Government have recognised the sovereignty of Bahrain over these islands, these shoals have been allotted to Bahrein although they fall on the Qatar side of a median line, but this hardly takes us any further forward than the phrasing in paragraph 4 of this Agency’s letter No.0/122? of 23rd December, 1947. I would therefore His Excellency Mr. C.J. Felly, O.B.E., Ag. Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. 5 - i+b—-K - 2 - th^refore be glad to know if I can inform him of the basis of the allotment in similar terms to those employed in Sir Rupert Hay’s letter No.l26-S of 18th January, 1947, paragraph 7, where he says that they have been treated by the Bahrain Government as their property and beacons have been erected and wells bored without any kind of protest by the Shaikh of Qatar prior to 1947. I am not certain why Sprague wants this information, but I suspect that it is for submission to the Company’s Legal Advisers* Yours sincerely. *3■■■■ Confidential No.C/L-306.

Dear Pinhey, I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from Jacomb about the Superior Oil Company’s operations in Qatar, 2. I propose to reply to his paragraph 7, if you see no objection, that the channels of coonunication proposed are probably the best to be expected under the present circumstances, in view of the lack of a Chief Local Representa tive in Doha. I consider that Garrett will keep us fully informed of all that goes on between him and Saleh al Mani* or Plant; in this respect Superior have proved themselves more co-operative so fer than P.C.L, Inci dentally, I have informed Garrett that he is unlikely to find anyone suitable for the posi tion of C.L.R. here, and that in view of the importance of the post it would be better to recruit someone in England after making sure that he has all the exacting requirements, including really fluent Arabic.

Dear Sir: ^ I have received your letter'No. c/L-311, dated 35th September, 1950, with attached copy of letter and enclosures from His Majesty s Government dated 8th September, 1950, and addressed to Mr.T. kuir- Warden of the Central Mining and Investment Corporation,Ltd. The conditions laid down therein have been noted and will be followed until such time as some clarification of several matters included in this Foreign Office letter and enclosures can be accomplished. Our Los Angeles office has been advised ol the points needing clarification and I will correspond further with you upon receipt of their comments on these matters. You are further advised with this letter that unless His Majesty’s Government commences the necessary proceedings for final fixing of the outer boundaries of our Qatar concession, or actually sets the outer boundaries of our Qatar concession, within the very near future a grave financial injustice is going to be brought to bear on The Superior Oil Co., and the Central Mining and Invest ment Corporation, Ltd., as operators of the Qatar Marine Concession, ^ by the failure of His Majesty’s Government to establish the final boundaries of this concession. The same thing applies to the fixing of the actual boundaries by His Majesty’s Government of the island and shoal areas to be excluded from the Qatar Concession held by The Superior Oil Co., and the Central Mining and Investment Corporation,Ltd. From an operational standpoint it will be very expensive to complete the exploratory work in the areas between the present approved limits for exploratory work set out in this Foreign Office Enclosure I and the final concessionary boundaries. In some cases it may not be feasible to ever work these 4&gt; areas due to the added expense involved. His Excellency the Sheikh of Qatar will lose financially if these final concessionary boundaries are not established by His Majesty’s Government prior to the date drilling of a well is to be commenced by the operators of this concession since it will not be possible to commence the drilling of any well in any area where the final boundary, whether due to outer limits, island, or shoal, is in question or dispute. This will undoubtedly retard the development of and production from this concession. ^s s'7, bi rom: The Superior oil Co., Bahrain £age # 2. October 3,1950 io : Ir. U.

AJG:vnhBRITISH RESIDENCY BAHRAIN. C 9th October, 1950 My first Comment on Andrew*s letter to Pinhey No.C/R-513^of the 30th September about the Superior Oil Company’s operations in Qatar is that Jacomb should be supplied at once with copies of the company’s concession and Political Agreement, and if you see no objection, I should be grateful if you could arrange for this to be done. 2. I think it important that correspondence with the Ruler should be put on proper lines as soon as possible and at first sight can see no reason why Garrett should not be appointed as Chief Local Representative of the company in Qatar for the purposes of Article 4 of the Political Agreement. The local Manager should in any case, in my opinion, pending the appointment of himself or somebody else as Chief Local Representative, correspond with the Qatar Government through the Political Officer in the spirit of Article 4 of the Political Agreement, and it would seem appropriate that the Political Officer should forward all correspondence received to the Adviser unless there are any special reasons for delivering any communications personally to the Shaikh. Neither of the matters referred to in Jacomb’s letter appear to me to be ’’routine oil husiness” and should have been dealt with in this manner. 3. Presumably the Company will deal direct with Saleh al Mani* in all routine oil business if he is the duly authorised representative of the Ruler for the purposes of the concession, c.f. Articles 14, 17, 21 and 22 of the Concession. 4. If you agree with my views, I suggest that subject to the concurrence of the company, we ask H.M.G. to approve the appointment of Garrett as its Chief Local Representative, at any rate for the time being, and that meanwhile, he be asked to conduct correspondence with the Qatar Government in accordance with the terms of Article 4 of the Political Agreement.

Dear Sir: This letter and the attached sketch is furnished you as a result of our recent discussion regarding permission by His Majesty f s Government to the commencement of geophysical work by The Superior Oil Co., and the Central Mining and Investment Corporation Limited in that portion of their Qatar Concession outlined on the attached sketch prior to November 7, 1950. The attached sketch shows roughly the following: Point A, 27° N. and 51°20 t E, the northwestern extremity of the area approved Sept.8,1950, by His Majesty T s Government for geophysical work by the Operators of the Qatar marine concession. Point B, a point north of Has Rakan and on the outer limit of the territorial water belt off the coast of Qatar. This point was also established by His Majesty's Government's letter of Sept. 8,1950. The line AB thus becomes the west line of the area presently approved by His Majesty's Government for geophysical work on this concession. The line BC represents roughly the outer limit of the territorial waters belt off the northwest coast of Qatar. The line CD has as I understand previously been fixed by His Majesty's Government in roughly the position shown on the sketch as one of the dividing lines between Bahrain and Qatar. The line DE has also previously been fixed I understand by His Majesty's Government in approximately the position shown on the sketch as another of the dividing lines between Bahrain and Qatar. The line EF is an extension of the line DE northward and is shown in its position on the sketch for simplicity only. The final boundary should fall to the west of line EF and extend northward beyond latitude 27°N. Point F is therefore placed in its position on the sketch Manama, Bahrain, October 27, 1950mm Oct. 27,1950. for ease of description only, being located at 27°N, 51 E. The line FA extends from 27 N, 51 E to 27°\ T , 51 20 f iL. to complete the outline of the proposed work area in the simplest manner possible. His Majesty's Government’s approval prior to Nov.7,1950, to perform geophysical work within the area outlined above is requested for the following reasons: 1. The Rogers-lay geophysical Company has been employed on a contract basis to do seismic work on the 'latar concession and their crew and seismic boats are scheduled to arrive in Bahrain on Nov.7,1950. 2. The large boat to be used for the? housing of this crew, their supplies and so forth will not arrive until sometime after the arrival of the seismic boats and crew since necessary alterations on this boat to adequately house the crew in the* Persian Gulf could not be completed in so short a time. As a result, it will be necessary to have this crew on Bahrain Island until the large boat arrives. 3. The area to be worked by the Rogers-Ray crew prior to the arrival of the large boat must be as near Bahrain as possible since crew members will be required to com^lte between Bahrain Island and their work area each day. The percentage of their work day spent in travel to and from the job increases with distance and in direct proportion the percentage of their work day on the job decreases. Thus from an operational standpoint it becomes mandatory that their work area be as close to Bahrain as our con cession area permits. 4. As you know, definite comniitments with time limitations are included in the concessionary agreement covering this area. These commitments with time limitations make it essential to obtain a maximum amount of work from each crew for each day prior to said commitment dates if the terms of the concessionary agreement are to be As previously stated by me in my letter ol Gct..*,195G, requesting the fixing of concessionary boundaries, the operator of this concession will abide by all of /the terms contained in the Foreign Office letter of Sept.8,1950, pertaining to islands, shoals etc., until some clarification can be obtained on certain points'contained in said letter. As you know the Dibal and Jaradeh shoals fall within the outlined area and we realize that His Majesty’s Government has previously held that these shoals belong to Bahrain. Particular care will be exercised by the operator of the Qatar concession in this portion of the outlined area so that no misunderstanding shall arise as a result of exploratory operations carried on by the operator fulfilled.page # 3 Oct. 27,1950. of the Qatar concession near these shoal areas.

These shoals lie within our Qatar marine concessional area, and we are now prepared to explore this area by geophysical means. Pending a decision on the territorial waters question involving Dibal and Jaradeh, we desire to include these waters in our exploratory work. We are, however, prepared to commit ourselves not to drill any well within the three mile band of waters surrounding Dibal and Jaradeh, at least until our right to do so has been established. We have discussed this matter with Bahrain Petroleum Company, through its manager Mr. Russell Brown. We found them to be fully cognizant of and sympathetic with our problem. However, they take the view that they are not in a position either to consent or object direct to this Company exploring the waters surrounding Dibal and Jaradeh, since their rights are contingent and prospective. They referred us to His Magesty*s Government and to the Ruling Sheikh of Bahrain for permission to explore the waters in question. Accordingly, we respectfully urge approval of your office and that you obtain for us the approval of the Sheikh, so that we may include all these waters in our geophysical exploratory work.

Dear Sir, Receipt is acknowledged of your letter of ^6vember 1950 with which you forwarded a copy of letter 1 , 0 . ^127 / 3? dated 8 November 1950, fromthe Foreign Office to the London - from Representative of The Bahrein Petroleum Company. Recently The Bahrein Petroleum Company receiver the Superior Oil Company a copy of that company s , you of 24 November 1950 requesting that you secureauthorization of the Ruler of Bahrein to explore for petrolemintheterrit _ waters surrounding Dibal and Jaradeh, which His ^Britannic Majesty Government have recognised to be within the jurisdiction Bahrein. Y • 7th December, 1950 4 You are, of course, fully cognizant of the exclusive nature of the rights possessed by The Bahrein Petroleum Company to nrosoect for petroleum throughout the present and future 5 the Ruler of Bahrein, as granted by the Ruler of t2?rein unon the advice of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf under terms of the concession contracts between the Ruler ££th£ comply! We too, that you f dtheRulerofBahrein wil3 uermit no action to prejudice this right or to cause dama 0 e to the interests of this company. The letter of Superior Oil Company contains a statement . ' that the shoals of Dibal and Jaradeh are within the Qatar marine &gt; concessional area of that company. With the terms of the concession to which they refer we are not familiar. It i , however our understanding that the concession was granted y the 6 Sheikh of Qatar. If that is correct it conveys no valid viehts excent in areas which are within the domains^ of tnat Ruler and concerning which he possessed rights which he was capable of granting. SQ/U- jit-o/S I 39/4l/4/ /5V {V*Y . r T.T£ ' , .E T 1 &gt; nM q —No. C/PA-449. 2 7th December, 19?0- From the several copies of letters addressed to the Ruler of Bahrein which you have transmitted to this company, together with letters addressed by the Ruler to His Britannic Majesty's Government, it is evident that a dispute exists concerning the sovereign in whom lie rights of jurisdiction over a considerable portion of sea area between the main islan of Bahrein and the Qatar peninsula. The determination of sovereign rights is, of course, a matter for the sovereigns concerned. Since important property and contractual rights of The Bahrein Petroleum Company are involved, however, this company is necessarily interested in a settlement of the dispute in accordance with justice. nis Britannic Majesty's Government has likewise taken an interest in securing a just and friendly settlement, and, this company has no doubt, will use its great influence to promote that conclusion. Some 12 years ago The Bahrein Petroleum Company and the company holding the Qatar oil concession then supposed to extend to the limits of Qatari jurisdiction were prime competitors for an oil concession from the Ruler of Bahrein which would include all the sea areas under his jurisdiction m the directio of Qatar. At that time the history of the area was ^nown to all who were interested. It was well understood tnat tne neonle of the island state of Bahrein had for centuries secured their livelihood from the seas, where^alarge proportion ox them lived for many months of each year, diving for pearls, trapping the fish that provided much of their food, taking fresh water from the undersea springs, drying their fish on Sj ? oa ^ sandspits from one to another of which they moved their barasti huts with the change of seasons. ^ As the semi-nomadic tri es of the mainland developed a home in the land areas around ;n they moved iid lived and thus affixed in their Government sovereign riphts to those areas, so these island people made a home of the seas and shoals upon which they lived. Much of this activity of the business of life tocknlace in the area between Qaoar and the main island of Bahrein, both of which had been the homes of the Rulers of these people. Knowing this background, and knowing also that few neonle lived even on the mainland of this si £®.°f, t ^ e 3 a ^ ar Peninsula, a desolate and inhospitable land blighted by the absence of sweet water, the Qatar company, in proposing that the Ruler of Bahrein divide his area and grant part to each comoeting company, drew a boundary line at the place where it assumedthe Qatari jurisdiction, to the limit of which it believed it had a concession, ended and Bahrein jurisdiction began. Although he did not say that this marked the outer limit of his domains, the Ruler of Bahrein accepted this line as a boundarv^t 5 least on the Bahrein side of which all area was 1No. C/PA-449. - 3 - 7th December, 1950• H &gt; cJ J- cj \ 0 Jo Ut under his jurisdiction by sending the map containing it to the British Political Agent, requesting that the map be forwarded to the competing companies for their consideration of the division of Bahrein concessional areas there suggested. .r nis map, indicating Bahrein jurisdiction up to the line drawn y the Qatar company, was then sent by the Political^ Agent to Bahrein Petroleum Compemy for its comments upon the propose division of the area shown. If there were previously any doubts concerning jurisdiction on the Bahrein side of this line, ^ ese .^ c ^ 1 2? s clearly established in the minds of all at the time that the Qatar oil company involved, the Ruler of^Bahrein and the Britis Political Agent were certain that jurisdiction resided in tne Ruler of Bahrein. Concerning the area beyond the line no beliefs were indicated; but certainty existed for tne Bahrein side of the line. IO Without reason to question the indications of ^ jurisdiction thus given, The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited shortly thereafter concluded negotiations through the Political Agent and purchased from the Ruler of Bahrein the exclusive right to explore for, develop and produce oil throughout the Ruler’s domains, of which-this area was a clearly understood ' part, and obligated itself to find and develop all the oil 4 £ Vl resources therein. This contract was concluded upon the advicev of the Political Resident. In connection with the contract The Bahrein Petroleum Company and His Britannic Majesty s ^ Government executed a Political Agreement which recognised the yO British interest in the advancement of this area upon democrat 1 u principles, with justice and the protection of rights. v In accordance with the rights and obligations thus accepted, and in reliance upon the indications of Bahrein jurisdiction thus given, The Bahrein Petroleum Company has during the past eleven years expended large amounts of labour and materials throughout all of this area m its search for oil. These activities were performed under the auspices of and on behalf of the Government and State of Bahrein. To the best of the company's knowledge, no other sovereign or person has ever objected to any of the vast amount of work periormed and investment made by The Bahrein Petroleum Company in the area between the main island of Bahrein and the boundary indicated by the line on the above mentioned map. Beyond tnat line it is realized that uncertainty might exist. How the dispute arose concerning the jurisdiction over a portion of this area The Bahrein Petroleum Coir^any has never been informed. It appreciates, however, that His Britannic Maiesty's Government have been using their good offices in a^i effort to effect a fair and just settlement ofNo. C/PA-449. 4 7th December, 1950. the disoute. The first proposal for such settlement, made by the British Government nearly three years ago and rejected by the Ruler of Bahrein, appeared to have been made witnout consideration of a number of factors concerning which it was assumed evidence would be sought and received. io this tne company invited the attention of His Majesty 1 s Ministry or Commonwealth Relations, which then supervised such matters for the British Government. Since that time, to the best of the company 1 ^ knowledge, ,, further progress toward settlement of the^dispute ^as een limited to your letter to the Ruler of Bahrein of 30 April 19 9 restating the British Government's views, a response by me Ruler repeating his rejection of the settlement ^ n ® re pro P^ e ’ and a letter by the Ruler to His Britannic Majesty s Foreign Minister which, among other enquiries, raised quesu 10 ns 01 procedure appropriate for settlement of the dispute. Until recently the Bahrein Petroleum Company is^ N believed to have been the only company possessing commercial rights in the area in dispute. At the present time it alone has made a large investment there. From the above cited statements in the letter to you of the Superior Oil Company, however, and from the letter from the British Foreign Office to The Bahrein Petroleum Company's . Repre ^ n 1 tatl '!®’ appears that Superior Oil Company now believes it has acquire* some rights in the area in dispute and tnat ^^ends to explore and presumably to exploit the area. It muot be obvio that any stens taken to accomolish these results would cause great^mSe P ?o the Ruler of Bahrein and to The Bahrein Petroleum Company, potential damages to which are increased by its con siderable investment in the area. This conroany believes that His Britannic Majesty’s Government, desiring a just settlement, have recognised the -erious results which would flow from activities of one company which mi^ht damage rights possessed by the other company prior to comnlltion of a settlement binding upon the sovereigns_ involved and that efforts are essential to prevent injuries pending a determination of rights in accordance with Anglo-Saxon principles of justice. ^ This understanding of the views of the British c overnment was furthered by a recent visit made by represent- ative^of Superior Oil Company to The Bahrein Petroleum Company' s , London Representative, apparently at the suggestion of the British Government, in which the Superior representatives nr op osed that the two companies agree to do no wotk m an area ^Slated to be under disputed jurisdiction pending settlement of the dispute. Because it is under a contractual obligation u PaJje tyRti y^/iu- 5 - 7th December, No. C/PA-449. 1950. to work throughout the domains of the Ruler of Bahrein, this company cannot properly enter into such a restrictive agree ment. It is suggested, however, that to avoid damage to rights unon either side and thus prevent any grievances which would complicate a peaceful and just settlement of the dispute, by mutual arrangement each sovereign involved migijt request the companies holding concessions under him to refrair irom work in the area of dispute for a stipulated period 01 time, such period to terminate earlier upon the reaching of an agreed settlement. Desiring to cooperate with the British Government in its efforts to secure a just conclusion o 1 tne ifdispute, The Bahrein Petroleum Company would not object to u , 1 such a restriction of its contractual rights to develop all » v 0 1 domains of the Ruler of Bahrein. It appears that the area £ involved in the dispute and to which such requests would app y is the area lying between the line proposed in your letter to the Ruler, dated 23 December 1947, and the eastern line drawn f by the Qatar company and cited in the Ruler s letter Political Agent dated 8 June 1938 and m the Political Agent s letter of the same date to The Bahrein Petroleum Company, 1 excepting the Hawar enclave, Fasht ad Dibal and ivatat ad Jaraae. , concerning which no dispute exists. 61 'Subsequent to the mutual suspension of work in the area by request of the sovereigns, it is assumed that Rp- 5 Majesty’s Government would desire tnat the sovereigns w o may be parties to the dispute agree to accept^a decision to be reached after all have had a full opportunity to explain the bases of the opposing claims and to furnish information that may be of assistance in reaching a just conclusion. Less than this would obviously be contrary to the requiremen s of due nrocess upon which the English system of justice Rf 12 been built and which is now the foundation of peaceful relations between the free nations of the world.

RAiTRTi’.TKf PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITEDConfidential. &gt; 37/6/50 On 29 th November, Smith and Garrett of the Superior Oil Company came to Doha. They arrived in the morning, lunched with Saleh A1 Mana 1 and then went to the Palace to do business with the Ruler. Abdul Rehman Darwish was also present and the Ruler sent for Plant to help him too. 2. A long argument then ensued about the three launches and a car which Superior had said some time ago they would consider giving to the Ruler. The Ruler was told that a launch 220 feet long was the size of a destroyer and could hot be gifted as it could be turned into a weapon of war. After much argument the meeting broke up, as no agreement on the type or size of launch or car could be reached. The Ruler also put the point that Superior should have their base in Qatar. This was strongly rebutted by Smith. In fact Superior did not give way at all, and the Ruler got nothing. iflouJr 3 , The same argument took place for a shorter time after Smith and Garrett had dined with the Ruler. Later Smith and Garrett went univited to the Adviser*s house and went over the same arguments. Smith then asked if Plant was anything to do with H.M.G. On receiving the answer that he was a servant of the Ruler, Smith produced a draft agreement between the Ruler and Superior to lengthen the period of exploratary work before drilling (Article 6 of the Concession) from two years to three years. i%e==Rqlro r as aid he would do nothing but consider it and put the point to the Ruler. After dinding me out at 9 S&gt;.m., Smith and Garrett left at 7 a.m. the next day. This draft agreement gives the following reasons for extension of the period:- / 1. The distance from source of material (USA) to Qatar. 2. The time needed by Governments to define the boundaries of the Concession. 3. The tide and Shamals. Phe Adviser told me all the above, and asked whether had p-iven their approval under article 29 # 1 told him that I had no information. He said that Smith said he had asked the Foreign Office who said that if he wanted to negotiate it he could go ahead. I then told the Adviser that I consider it most unwise for him to put Superior’s case to the Ruler: he should by all means advise the Ruler if he got the opnortunity, but should leave to Superior their own negotiating* 5 The Adviser spoke to the Ruler about the agreement the next day, and suggested that he thought the matter over and not sign anything in a hurry. On Friday Abdul Rehman Darwish went to Bahrain, and mith has since told me that he went there on behalf of the Ruler o sav there was still a chance of getting the question of the aunches and car settled if Smith could return. Abdullah Darwish aw Smith in Bahrain and when asked said he thought that it was ie:ht that the two years period should be extended. By then uperior had got Saleh and Darwish on their side, but had not hemselves put the Question to the Ruler, and Smith was thus illing to retunn to Doha in the afternoon of 1st December. 7. The next,.- Smith^ Ji n* Uc, 7# The next morning at 9 a*m. he called on me and went over what had gone before. He said that you had told him it was alright to try for an extension, but could not help him to obtain it. Smith was in a very nervous state and agreed reluctantly that he would if necessary balance the extension of the two years period with the gift of the launches and the car. He also 1*Ld me of letters between his Company and the Ruler about which I am writing separately. He made quite a point of saying that this visit of his had not so far gone well. He has certainly been firm with the Ruler and has told him that his Company do not like all this haggling over their gifts. This is a good thing. 8 . He told me about the agreement and said he was going on to the Palace to negotiate it. He had be then written into the agreement a sentence to the effect that it was 'Subject to H.M.G^s. approval'. After an all day argument broken only by lunch, het/ithe launches demabs down to one local-type launch -g. 60 foot long and two similar Xx to the Pan Tan 111 (used by Superior as a ship to shore launch) all powered by petrol engines, and the vehicle demand to one Diamond T. His Company would give these in exchange for the extra year. During the negotiations the Ruler had asked and paid attention to the views of the Adviser; he had also asked the views of Saleh and Abdul Rehman Darwish, in each case going outside the room and whispering. 9 # in the end agreement was reached that in consideration of the extra year the Superior Oil Company could give three launches and one Diamond T vehicles Smith signed his part of the agreement but the Ruler then said the local launch should be longer, and Smith had to tear his signature off the agreement. The Ruler then said he would sign it and it was agreed that the Adviser should have the agreement retyped. Smith then left Doha. -jO. No sooner was the agreement retyped than the Ruler changed his mind and said the local launch must have a keel 65 feet 'long and the engine should be a diesel one and Superior must sign first. The agreement was therefore sent to Bahrain by the Adviser. a a Smith is certainly tougher than some Oil Company / negotiators. His preparation of the ground seems to have been good and lie said it was only unwillingly that he bargained Company gifts for the extension. However, having shown himself strong at the start it almost came round in the end to the Ruler giving the extension in order to get what were originally g Imith was, like anyone, disgusted by the Ruler’s ° f f ^ pre ~ ciation of the fact that Superior were making a gift in ^ne first instance and did not like being criticiSsd for wha ey were giving. a 2 The Adviser sent the agreement to Bahrain for signature, together with a supplementary document to be signed by four witnesses (Plant, Saleh A1 Mans'/and his interpreter) specifying the types and sizes of launch. The Adviser put down a 65 feet hut as Smith had not agreed to this he crossed it out and returned it with the agreement signed. This was brought ovei to Doha on the Uth December by Smith's interpreter, who after discussion with the Adviser and the Ruler, was asked to take hack a message to Smith that the Ruler was sticking at 65 feet ^d a dillel engine. This he did, and no further visits have been made to Doha. i-z i give you these details merely as a record of the lenp-ths to which the Ruler of Qatar goes when it comes to negations of gifts and so on. The Adviser was rather too active about the business, on the whole, but he did get sent for by thp Ruler and he did give advice which was accepted, so that is crain Superior’s stubborness is, I consider, most wholesome. *.'!p.ny, M., o.b.k. xJS H.M. Political Agent, Bahr ain. Ih—^ ~ wBritish Agency, Doha, 17th December, 1950. You will recall that we discussed my letter 20/71/50 of 23rd October when you were here at the beginning of Novem ber. I am now writing about letters between the Ruler of Qatar and Superior Oil Company. 2. When Smith of Superior was here recently I brought up this question of minor agreements btween his Company and the Ruler. He told me that there are three, copies of which should have been sent by Sprague or G-arrett to you at the Agency. As you have not got these letters it looks as though Superior are either not being as open as they pretend or consider the matters trivial. Whatever the reason for their reticence may be, I should like to have copies of the correspondence because these matters are certainly of importance and should be done through H.M.G. The three letters are:- A/o 'yt* LjX-i G ■ t Prom Superior to the Ruler agreeing to certain - ’’conditions” before being allowed to put up * Survey markers in Qatar on the land, - I cannot comment until I have seen them. 2) Prom Superior to the Ruler expressing their intention of giving 'preference to the A1 Darwish' where contracts are concerned in accondance with the wish of the Ruler. - Smith said Superior had no intention of sticking i to this general undertaking: he denied they had promised to give preference to the Darwish: j they desliked monopolies and w^ished to be fair to all. In fact they have already hired a lau nch from Mohammed A1 Mananas well as their one from Abdullah Darwish, but for Rs. 3,000 per month while Abdullah Darwish draws Rs.4,000. However, I do , at present, think that Superior intend to avoid being in Darwish 1 s pocket if they can. 3 ) Prom Superior to the Ruler about armed guards for their Surveyers. - Again I cannot comment until I see the text. ii Smith said Garrett has copies of all these letters and I have been waiting until he came here so that I could tackle him myself. He has, however, not come and does not seem to be coming for some time. I shall be veiy grateful therefore if you could please ask Garrett for copies and let me have one of each. r I recommend that Garrett be told that in future we wish to see all correspondence which is not stricl^tly routine oil business'.
