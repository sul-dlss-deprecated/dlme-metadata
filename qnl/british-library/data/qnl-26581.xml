The map, which was prepared in anticipation of frontier negotiations with the Saudi Arabian Government, shows possible lines for the south-eastern Saudi Arabian border, as proposed by the Foreign Office.A blue line, drawn in blue crayon and descending from slightly west of Qatar, represents the 'blue line', a boundary line agreed between the British Government and the Ottoman Empire in the Anglo-Ottoman Convention (1913). A second blue line further to the east represents one possible boundary. A third line, drawn in red crayon, shows another possible concession; this line includes a portion of a larger 'desert zone'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100054086307.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
