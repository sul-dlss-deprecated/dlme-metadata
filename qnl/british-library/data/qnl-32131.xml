(E 3654/489/93). No.210 (787/2/43). With the Compliments of the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs British Embassy, Bagdad, 5“ J0L 1343 13th June, 1? Sir, V ' You v/ill recall that in the summer of 1941, with 1941, wi th 0 ^ ^' your approval, I organised in this country a staff of . fo/i Political Advisers with assistants to combat anti-Britisho activities of all kinds, to keep me informed of oolitica!* and social developments throughout the country and to secure co-operation between the local Iraqi authorities and the British military forces. 2. In July 1941 I addressed to each of the officers who had then been appointed to this organization a paper defining their position and explaining to them the lines on which I wished them to direct their activities. 3. Recently there has come a need to revise this directive and I have accordingly sent a new letter to all officers of the Political Advisory Staff in which I have explained the work to which, in present circumstances and in the light of the changes that have occurred in the last two years, they should now give their attention. 4. It may be of use to have these papers in your archives and I accordingly transmit copies herewith. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosures to the Minister of State in Cairo. I have, etc., (Signed) Kinahan Cornwallis. I ' ?&gt; '- The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P etc., etc., e etc. • 94. It is possible now too, to begin to think of the future and though we cannot foresee what changes in international relations and in British foreign and imperial policy may be brought about by the defeat of the Axis, we may safely proceed on the assumption that the political, strategical and economic importance of our position in the Middle East will increase rather than diminish. There are accordingly certain elements in our relations with Iraq which we should without doubt develop and strengthen. We must above all, continue to cultivate friendly feelings towards Great Britain and the British people among all classes of Iraqis and to be at its best this feeling should cover all points of view and every aspect of the life of the country. Y/e want the Iraqis to feel not only that a political alliance between Iraq and Great Britain is advantageous but also that British help and co-operation will be of solid value in every kind of legitimate national, and indeed individual, endeavour. In short we want to convince the greatest possible number of Iraqis, and especially the youth of the country, that they can best get what they want through our help and at the same time we have the task of persuading them to want what is best for them. 5. You will not need me to tell you that this is a very big task and one that will need the energies of all our different organisations. 6. We must bear in mind, however, that if we have influence we cannot escape a measure of responsibility for the general state of the country. We must therefore do all that we can (without infringing on the sovereignty and independence of the Iraqi State, the preservation of which is the basis of our policy) to help those responsible for the work of administration to do it better and to the increasing satisfaction of the people. Your own position brings you into especially close contact with the officials and your experience and the opportunities which you have for touring and meeting the tribes and village people, give you an exceotional knowledge of administrative problems. It is therefore the particular duty of the Political Advisory Staff to do all that they can within the above limits to improve the administration. There are, of course many ways in which this can be done but it would be inexpedient to attempt to lay down bard and fast rules. The guiding principle should be to foster trust and confidence between the officia-ls and the people and to encourage, wherever it can be seen, however dimly, the ^pirit of public service. The best solvent for so many of Iraq s problems would be to put the idea of co-operation in the place of the age-old antipathy which still survives between the Government and the oeople, and to this end to try and make the latter grasp that they are ultimately responsible for the former. In this connection you should never allow to oass uncontested suggestions that His Majesty’s Government should take charge of administration themselves. Apart from the fact that it is not -practical politics to contemplate such an about turn in cur policy, it is necessary to educate Iraqis to the realisation that having sought and secured independence, they must live up to their responsibilities. It is unnecessary for me to dilate more fully on this aspect of your duties since I am well aware that you are already acting in accordance with the principles laid down in this paragraph. I am, indeed, inclined to reckon as the greatest achievement of the Political Advisory Staff the remarkable manner in which by gaining the confidence of officials they have been able to influence the ' local administration. 7. I should add something about Arab nationalism and the attitude which you should adopt towards it. The Arabs of Iraq as a • ♦ ; • whole/4 whole are interested in varying degrees in three main questions outside their regional problems. These are:- tl) Palestine and Zionism, ( 2 ) Syria and the French, (3) Arab Union. The best line to take about these questions when they come up for discussion is as follows (1) The White Paper of May 1939 is the declared policy of His Majesty’s Government. It is a fair settlement which gives the Arabs a real chance to build up a prosperous Palestine in which Arab culture and the Arab way of life can continue to flourish and the Arab people share in the progress and development which the Jews wdll hasten. ( 2 ) This is a question that must be left for settlement until after the war. Meanwhile His Majesty’s Government have given pledges for Syria’s independence and the people of Syria (and of Iraq; may be sure that His Majesty’s Government will stand by these undertakings. (3) You are already acquainted with the declared attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards this question. It is that they will give their full support to any scheme to strengthen the cultural, economic and political ties between the Arab countries which commands general approval but the initiative in formulating any such scheme must come from the Arabs themselves. In discussing Arab union or federation you may well emphasise the obstacles which lie in the way of the realisation of this ideal, the dynastic rivalries, the sectarian antagonisms, the regional economic interests and the nolitical inexperience of the people themselves. You may ooint out that these obstacles have all to be overcome before union can be a success and you may show that the progress made in Iraq could easily be destroyed by a nremature attempt to federate the country with its neighbours. 8. This letter, though already long, has not I know touched on many of the problems with which you have to deal from day to day nor is it indeed feasible to be comprehensive where the diver sity of tasks is so great. I therefore leave it to you to write to me on any particular aspect of your work regarding which you feel in need of guidance. You may be sure that whenever you do so I shall do my best to help. It is in the nature of your w f ork that you have, on the whole, to act for yourselves in the way you judge best and it is on your own wisdom and discretion that I chiefly rely rather than on any guidance that I can give. The Political Advisory Staff has already a fine record and I am confident that it will continue to add to its good reputation and usefulness. 9. I am enclosing spare copies of this letter for you to send to your Assistant Political Advisers and Deouty Assistant Political Advisers. (Signed) Kinahan Cornwallis.Tkxd u iKi. y^i &lt;&lt;1+1 dinuJl&amp;L copy THE POLITICAL ADVISORY STAFF ' ' t 1.. The Political Advisory Staff will work directly under my orders through the Oriental Secretary. For the purposes of its work the country will be divided into three areas:- a) Northern area, the Li was of Mosul, Arbil, Kirkuk, Sulaimani and DLyalah. Headquarters will be at Kirkuk. b) Central area, the Liwas of Dulaim, Bagdad, Hillah, Kerbala, Diwaniyah, Kut, Amarah. Headquarters will be in Bagdad. c) Southern area, the Liwas of Basra and Nasiriyah. Headquarters will be in Basra. 2. . The staff will be shown on the strength of C.I.C.I. and all questions of pay, establishment, etc. will be arranged by C.I.C.I. 3. Its duties will be a} Military b) Political. 4. Its military duties will be a) to keep in close touch with local military commanders, b) to arrange for co-operation of civil authorities with local military commanders, c) to establish good relations between the civil population and the British forces, d) to infom local military commanders of political developments and events in so far as they affect the, military situation and to give them any topographical or other information which they may require. e) to accompany military columns when necessary, after first obtaining my approval. 5* Political Duties The main duty of the Political Admisory Staff will be to fight Nazi influence in all its forms in this country, to prevent the possibility of the recurrence of another rising against us and to make such preparations as are possible to meet a German advance. It is difficult to define in exact detail how these objects are to be attained and I wish Political Advisors to have a wide discretion. A month ago this country was completely in the hands of fifth columnists and although the arch- villians have fled, the machine remains with plenty of smaller villains to work it. Thanks to their intensive propaganda over a period of years, the Germans have created a hatred of us amongst certain classes which did not before exist and although temporarily eclipsed, it is obvious that they will, take the first opportunity to recover their position. I am determined to fight them witk. all the means in our power and in this fight /thei &amp; the Political Advisers must play a most important part. Speaking in general terms our different lines should be:- • \ j ' 1 * \ ’ . . » 5 ry f * . , t p f ffT a) to strengthen our contacts and our friendships with friendly Iraqi officials, with the ashraf and with tribal leaders both in the towns and country areas. I expect each Political Adviser and Assistant Political Adviser to keep in close touch with all such people in their areas, and to bring home to them the value of British friendship and the danger of the German menace. These are the people on whom we will have mainly to rely if that menace.becomes imminent and we must work intensively amongst them during the present respite - especially amongst the Shaikhs. They are not very reliable material but at least it can be said that most of them stood out against the pressure brought to bear by Rashid Ali recently. Bach member of the Political Advisory Staff has .... been specially chosen because- he is. known to and trusted by many Iraqis and I also have many old contacts. Pull advantage must be taken of this and every effort must be made to create a more positive attitude in our favour. Our immediate task is to strengthen our position. Before long I hope it will be possible to proceed further and to put into action plans to meet the situation if the Germans . begin advancing towards Iraq. Money should be spent freely though judiciously and secretly but it is personal influence which will count more than anything else with the most influential people. Amongst the lesser fry money will be a powerful weapon. b) to strengthen the position of His Highness the Regent and his Government throughout the country. We now have a friendly Regent and Government in power and we must do all we can to ensure that they remain in power, furthermore, the work of the Political Advisory Staff would become impossible if they were not to have the co-operation and help of local officials. I have explained our objects frankly to the responsible Ministers concerned and obtained their concurrence. Political Advisers should therefore be careful to cultivate local officials especially the Mutasarrifs - and explain to them in general terms, what they are doing. (There will naturally be certain actions such as bribery which must be kept secret). They should be careful not to interfere in the administrative work in the-liwas or take any action which might raise unjustifiable suspicions. I hope that mutual confidence and co operation will be established, to a degree which will render easier our fight against enemy influence. c) by combating Nazi influence and all who are working for it in every way possible. As pointed out above much can be done by enlisting the help of friendly officials and encouraging them to take action against /unfriendly4 unfriendly influences. Pr6paganda, both overt and covert; is another obvious and important line and Political Advisers should keep in close touch with Mr. Perowne and Mr. Bishop. Bribery is a third course. Political Advisers must use their own judgment in classifying those who are friendly, those who might be persuaded by one means or another to become friendly and those who are irrecoverable. I imagine that the second class is a very large one and that many can be converted. The above is an outline of the political duties of the Political Advisory Staff. Different districts will present varied problems and will have to be dealt with accordingly. Political Advisers must use their discretions. Such problems as the Amy, the schools (especially in Bagdad) and Bagdad itself which is the centre from which the Axis propaganda has radiated are being given special attention and the question of propaganda (both overt and covert) is in the hands of the Public Relations Department of the Embassy. The Political Advisory Staff is thus a part - and a most important part - of the organisation which has been set up to fight enemy influence. 6. Reports Prom the above it will be seen that the duties of Political Advisers do not clash in any way with those of intelligence officers employed by C.I.C.I. Political Advisers will nevertheless collect a great deal of very useful intelligence and it will be reliable intelligence because it will be volunteered by reliable persons. They should therefore 1) Submit a short weekly report which should include a brief appreciation of the political situation in the area. A copy should be sent to C.I.C.I. and Mr. Edmonds. 2) Telegraph to me when necessary any important news. 3) Supply on request any special infomation which may be required by C.I.C.I., Mr. Edmonds or myself. 7. Special Reports Political Advisers should report to me weekly by D.O. letter on the progress of the anti-German campaign.'Af /r Sir K. Cornwallis, Ho, 13 31. 4th December, 1941.

Dear Peel, Will you please refer to your official letter EXT 5044/41 of the 26th August, about the proposal that Captain Tandy should he appointed Vice-Consul at Basra while serving with the military authorities. We note that this proposal is based on the fear that if the Persians discovered that Tandy was on military duties, the position in Persia of military members of the Political Service as a whole might be compromised. In Syria and elsewhere we have ourselves seconded a number of consular officers for service with the military authorities, they hold military rank and so on, and we have no reason to suppose that the position either of the individual officers, or of the service as a v/hole is likely to be compromised thereby. Moreover, since the Government of India sent their telegram on this subject, our position vis a vis of the Persian Government has been radically altered by the entry of Imperial forces into Persia. It hardly seems necessary now to pay the same attention to the exaggerated susceptibilities of the Persian Government, and for all we know, Tandy may have left Basra and accompanied the occupying forces into Persia. Before taking a definite decision we should therefore be grateful if you would explain the practice as regards our own consular officers to the Government of India and ask them if they still wish to maintain their request in the altered circumstances, and whether Alley anticipate that Tandy’s headquarters will remain Basra.

Irani In the event of measures failing to prevent Germans from taking possession of Caucasus oil fields it is cf the utmost importance that eastward passage through Iran or Afghanistan should be denied to Germany and that potential hostility of these countries should be reduced co sj.feCil.ve oy depriving them ox' German direction and organising ability. Removal of these especially from Iran (which in our opinion should be the first country upon which pressure is brought to bear) could not fail, to acid to military security and upset the German plans,, It would also secure aur xlcjAii.

A part of such economic pressure would be withholding of all war supplies from America or elsewhere destined to Iran. 5. We are encouraged by lehr on telegram Ho. 391 of June 20th to Foreign.

The Government of India ^ere asked to put forward names of men in the following two categories who would be suitable and could be made available for this purpose:- (i) Serving or retired British officers, either in India or the United kingdom; (ii) Shia Moslem officials now in India who could be used for propaganda purposes. The Government of India have suggested postponing the consideretion of (i) until the system of liaison officers for maintaining contact between the local military commanders and the civil officials in Iraq has been established. They say that they t*re ot present unaware what their commitments will be under this system and what liaison officers will be required* kith regard to (ii) the Governrent of India say that they will be able to find Shia koslem officials for the urpose indicated, but suggest that this also should wait until the chief liaison officer is appointed and candiscuss with the ambassador how many of these officials are required and wheifcer they should be located. lieanwhile H.k.Ambassador at Bagdad has emphasised the very great importance of establishing some organisation which will enable him to establish and maintain contact with the tribes and the influential Shaikhs in various parts of the country. This would be done by appointing experienced political officers who know and have gained the friendship of the chief tribal leaders and by the generous employment of money. The political officers would keep the Embassy informed of local political developments and events, establish close and friendly relations with the tribes, make propaganda and discourage the activities of enemy agents. As a first step the Ambassador with the support of the C.G.C. has as.-ed for authority to appoint for this work two experienced political lecturers whose land settlement contracts with the Iraqi Government have just expired and whom he intends to attach to the British military forces in North and South Iraq.MHHHHHI $2£u///f3. #c©mplime»t© Li 17^ 4 +^ ' 4&gt;H the - JSrr^ t €0 ^ tary of '^^3Ay^'’ • vlaign Af,air -® oid ^WxajL «?/**. ^ 3607 ^f'JdL /jUUlOClJ OL+b, QtxoCib. / /T &gt; /[This telegram is of pa rric-alar/iscore cly and jbofcjukk •o*0- by the authorised recap ienirand, no lipassed on] V ^ rriv/hlvi t v wap &gt;41 'cUJljuA.Xufu%.^ A* ^ and^should he retained M-, u [Cypher] * • \7AR CABIMET DISTtUBUTION J' V From: IRAQ FROM BAGDAD TO FOREIGN OFFICE Sir K.

If I can find right man, I may find it necessary to ask approval for appointment of another senior officer and two or'three junior'officers.

R. 9.i ///// IMMEDIATE, to run u uhat it The Cabinet is friendly and has satisfactorily met our major demands. Although country is now calm, at least superficially, and control of Iraqi Government appears iroughout Iraq, it cannot by any means be maintained has fully succeeded in consolidating its position. Some progress is being made, but failure of Government, in spite of my repeated representations, to take sufficiently strong and positive action against Rashid Ali and Axis cells both m the civil administration, the army and The Ministers them too hard elsewhere give me serious cause for anxiety. The sn l are well intentioned but weak and if I pusi may resign. Any show of hesitation by Iraqi Government will certainly be interpreted as weakness by the opposition and can only give encouragement to Axis supporters and discontented army elements to stage a come-back at the opportune moment. Bad news, especially from this or Middle East theatres of war would provide such encouragement. Nevertheless our troops here will continue to have stabilising effect an&amp; I sincerely hope that all those which were.allotted to Iraq.will be sent.as soon as possible^ Ai SO* \ of first importance, is the establishment of some organization which will enable me to establish and maintain contact with tribes and influential Sheikhs in various arts of the country. This aspect of our task appears to ave been completely neglected m the past, and Axis propaganda has been allowed to spread unhindered. The intensive work of 4 years cannot be successfully combatted in a few days, but in my opinion it is not too late to remedy this serious state of affairs by appointing experienced [?politicall officers who know and have gained the friendship of chief tribal leaders, and the generous employment of' money. YALthout a real effort of this kind which will at the same time strengthen the position of present Government, v/e shall never succeed m securing a proper hold over public opinion in outlying districts. Support from that quarter will prove a valuable asset if we are to maintain and increase our prestige and influence in Iraq. I am myself^meeting large numbers of my old sheikh friends and am [?fullyj satisfied with their attitude. But that is not sufficient. It is absolutely essential for this Embassy to be fully informed at all times of local political developments and events, to establish close and friendly relations with tribes, to make known by any form of propaganda the views and policy of His Majesty s Government, to emphasise the advantage of friendly.relations with Great Britain, and finally to discourage activities of enemy agents, I propose with your concurrence to pursue this policy to the utmost limit and I trust,.therefore, that the recommendations contained in my immediately following telegram will receive your immediate approval.wmmm* MOST SECRET CIPHER TELEGRAM mm. i ■ ; ’ r'! o&lt; 41 20293 Prom:— C* in C* Middle East, Dead. 0640 15/6/41.

R... ; -,- to look to Germany for support and we should use every means, to endeavc^r to induce them to throw in their lot with us./’* In discussion, it W&amp;I 3 pointed out that our policy towards pan-Arah and Syrian/aspirations had recently heen .. . . clearly and authoritatively defined hy the Foreign 1 r , .• Secretary. It had heen/made plain that we supported th©?. ■ - &lt; Shia claim to a greatei^share in influencing policy in r - Iraq.

A reply was awaited from the M*A.P. to the representations which had 'been made for the supply of the required material and the view was expressed that a higher priority should 'be given to the despatch of the small quantity of material required for the manufacture of Hurricane aircraft. • The suggestion was made that officials of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and of the British firms operating in Iran might be encouraged to co operate more vigorously with the anti-Axis activities of our political authorities in that country. As regards propaganda in Southern Persia, THE . FOREIGN SECRETARY said that we should have to be cautious in our employment of Indians for political work,, owing to the risk of offending the Shah, who ^ s ,^5L r e suspicious of any suggestion of political interferenc from India. Reference was made to the activities of German technical personnel in Iran and the that in order to encourage the reception of thelersl^n broadcasts of the B.B.C,, suitable wireless receiving se s should be distributed at very low prices to persons capable of influencing Iranian opinion. 4.

Middle East, below suggests^Mr. Thomas should be employed either as head of a Mission in Southern Iraq or in India.^ The telegram from India of May 26th referred to at the end of the cable seems to have been addressed to the C.in-C. Middle East and was not repeated to this country; it presumably referred to some military appointment for which Mr. Thomas considered suitable. It is understood that, on the strength of this cable, the War Office are getting into touch with him about his kit etc. with a view to getting him to Cairo as soon as possible. The chief interest of this Department in Ivlr. Thomas lies in the fact that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, with the approval of the Government of India, recommended him for the post of Publicity Officer, Persian Gulf (see Government of India 1 s telegram lJo.646 of 9th February and the Political Residents telegram below it). At the end of their telegram the Government of India said that, failing Thomas, they would have to seek for this post an officer from the Middle East Publicity Organisation. Row that, after a long delay, it is definitely known that Mr. Thomas will not be available, it seems necessary to find out whether the Government of India wish the Ministry of Information to be asked to help in pursuing this alternative possibility or in filling the post from elsewhere.

Fraser has stressed his need for political advisers and trained administrators, and though the control of operations has now been transferred to Middle East, we imagine that ‘War/ell will be glad of assistance on the lines which the Government of India suggest in meeting these requirements from political officers whom they have available with experience of Iraq or the Persian Gulf as well as from among officers of the R.A.F. or civilian personnel who may be available in Iraq. It seems clear that there will be a considerable need of personnel to conduct political contacts with the tribes, especially if the policy proposed at yesterday* o meeting of the Middle East (official) Committee (M.E.(0)41) is adopted. Aoart from any steps which are taken to meet immediate requirements in this direction from among personnel locally available, this is a need which is likely to Increase as our policy develops. Bertram Thomas, who is mentioned in Government of India’s telegram is now in London and I expect you know of him. Our Secretary of State had some correspondence v/ith the C.X.G.S. about him last December and January as a result of which Thomas returned from Canada to this country. He was seen by Davidson last April and wasafc that time recommended for a post under the Chief Political Officer, East Africa, but Mitchell was not able to place him at present so that Thomas is still available for service in Iraq. He is, of course, an outstanding Arab expert and had experience as a Political Officer in Iraq under Major General J.N. Kennedy, M.C., Arnold/ Director of Military Operations and Plane., Jar Office, S. Y.l.Arnold wilsom during and after the last vrar and is well acquainted with the Iraqi dialect of Arabic. We hope that Wave 11 will welcome the opportunity of using him* Thomas would like some indication of the capacity and position in which he would serve, and if Wavell agrees to his employment, the details could perhaps be arranged with the a.O.C., Basra, and Thomas could be flown out as soon os possible.

For immedia te tribal contacts we think best chance would be to extricate Slade and Domville and plac? them at Basra. Dickson, who will relieve Galloway in Kuwait, is (?well) (? qualified) for contacts with Shaznmar and other nomad tribes and in due course Th oma s should be useful. Grice, Assi;3tant in Iraqi Ministry of Interior, is now in India and we are approaching him and others. 4„ We consider that we shall need funds up to £200,000 in gold for the present for subsidizing tribes. We are sending at once £60*000 to General, Basra,and request that arrangements should be made to place at our disposal remaining £150,000 at earliest possible moment. A separate telegram concerning procedure in this connexion will follow tomorrow. Oi’ganisation on civil side will have to be Improvised* We visualise two branches; (a) Administrative, (b) Tribal bureau, both controlled by Hay acting under General* Basra. (a) would then be under Galloway and (b) under Slade, if available. Tribal Bureau would contact both settled and nomad tribes. Importance of latter is sufficiently indicated by Jedda telegram 144, May 4th. India Office, please to War Office. REC*. POL.

I understand that the reply from Middle East, while expressing seme misgiving about the Governraent of India’s proposals on the administrative side, agreed that personnel with knowledge would be of value for contact with the Iraq authorities and with the tribes.
