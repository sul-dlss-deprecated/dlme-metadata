I have authorized Commandant, Muscat Levies, to commence enlisting and training men, bu on recc.n- viBi ^ to Bahrain I discussed question with Political Agen* and Shaikh Hamad, and have come to conclusion that it is essent- -ial to have British Officer for two or three years, and raise and train corps at Bahrain. Hamad, as s aved in my ielegram No. 169, is very keen on levies as corps will give him independent backing and make his position much stronger. Kven before it is trained, the actual visible presence of men under training will have good effect and strengthen Hamad's position. It is in my opinion essential to success of reforms to get corps started forthwith . here is plenty of money available so I earnestly trusi Government will sanction deputation of an officer for two or three jrears to raise corps. After this, it an Assis tinr. Foliv- -ical Agent is sanctioned, and the corps has a good Indian officer, such as Subedar Wiaz Ali from iviusca ,whose services can be lent, the former can easily supervise it. As iorce will have to have fairly strong detachments in i uharraq, Budaiya and Sitrah and possibly o~her places, i: is necessary to have 150 as minimum - probably 200 will ultimately be necessaryr Capt. J. Eccles-Holmes, 10th Baluchi Regiment, (referred to in your 1229-S dated 11th October), who happens to be in Bahrain, would like to get appointment of Commandant. I do not know his military qualifications or whether military authorities would consider him suitable or Regiment be able toIfll IV 0 to spare him, but if opinion favourable and he could be spared, it would save time as he is on the spot. His leave will be finished in under three weeks so he will have to return to duty soon.

Hajor Daly has reported that these indents were framed on much too lavish a scale* it ia not therefore necessary to consider them further. he Government of India in their memorBndum lio. 28 (ivM, dated the 24th liaroh 1924, sanctioned the issue of ammunition to the Muscat Levy Corps from a stock surplus to the requirements of the lilitary at Bushire, which otherwise wfculd have been dumped in the sea. ISO boxes of l*ark VI ammunition were in due oourse sent in the H.I.M.S. 'Lawrence*' to Kuscat, and advantage was taken of the some opportunity to send 60 boxes to Bahrain. bere are three hundred rifles, the property of the Anglo-^ereian Oil Company, lying in the Residency, which the Company have authorised me to dump in the sea, and I intended doing this at the time of the final evacuation by the military garrison of Bushire.&lt;f1 w ' r Major Daly has asked for 160 of these flfles; they will at least be useful during the training of the men and perhaps will be found after trial to be sufficiently serviceable for retention. here is no necessity therefore at the moment for indenting for either rifles or ammunition. A modest indent for equipment is now submitted for transmission to the military authorities, if approved by '-ho Govemmont of India. It is hoped thut 9 for the sake of cheapness, the indent will be sent to Kirles* Araenal^and not to ^uottmi for compliance. Major Daly would like to have three Lewis guns in lieu of Vickers guns, but the tine seems to ne premature for such a request. Captain Gainpb^ i ^, the officer designated to train and Jcmmand the CorpSyhM not yet reached Bahrain* he time has therefore not come for me to submit a report on the training of the men.

Although I do not anticipate that a situation '..'ill ' rice m which the guns will have to be used,yet I think it of considerable importance that they should be equipped with them because th« moral effect in these parts is very great.Arabs have a very great respect for machine guns.So the fact that the levies are c quipped with thsm will go a long v;ay towards discouraging a recurrence of disturbances to prevent which is the raison d'etre of the Levy Corps. I recommendadtha substitution of Lewis guns for Vickers guns(which ^ had been indented for by Capt Alban) because the latter are,-, believe very much less expensive &amp; much simpler to use &amp; keep in order. . If you consider that guns are premature at this early stage in the life of the corps may I suggest that they have one only? In the eyes of the arabs it will give the corps considerable prestige.

Bushire. * Iwemoranduin . with reference to my express letter Ko.609, dated the 29th May, I 'beg to explain more fully the reasons why I advocate the return to India of 18 Rinds, desoatch- -ed 'by the Political A^ent, Kalat from ^uetta lor enlist- -ment in i.he Bahrain Levy Corps. The arrangements for the recruitment ot these personnel were made by kaj or i^aly, hut his original request was not for Rinds, hut for British Lekranis - his object 'bein^ to eliminate as far as possible the Persian element in the Corps. This was desirable for many reasons but particularly in order to avoid the possibility of the men deserting when they went on leave. I cannot for one moment believe that it was his intention to introduce into a small Corps of 125 ranks, of which 90 already had been recruited, an entirely new element, far removed in customs, habits and locality from those originally enlisted. If the age, habits and physique of these 18 Rinds were atall suitable lor lonriin^ the basis of a new Corps, 1 would endeavour to keep them and make the best of them. But many ol them are olo. men, their physique is decidely poor, and they are Indian Frontier tribesmen, who have very little in common with th Mekranis already enlisted. I consider that the discipline of the Levy Corps would be adversely affected by the retention of these men, an d I would strongly recommend following up kajor Daly's original intention of enlisting British Kekranis in the Corps. On the 27th April a^i party of 25 British kekrani arrived from Gwadur. They were recruited by the Commandant BUSH!RE '3)D£NCV. \ The Agency, Bahrain. e- 'n... . - I Date _ SIst kay 19*5. | I AL RECORDS^II. of the Lekran Levy Corps, through the good offices of the Political -rigent, Kalat. Unfortuneately seven of these men v/ere found medically unfit on arrival, and had to i/ie remainder have settled down very happily and are so thoroughly absorbed in the Corps that it is diffictt -ult to pick them out in the lines. I am convinced therefore that these latter are the type we require for the Corps, and I propose to ask for more ©i them at once, in order to complete the Corps to its lull strength. It is necessary, however, to insist on a pioper medical inspection before the men leave the headquarters ol the iaekran Levy Corps for Bahrain, I trust you will now approve of my returning the 18 Rinds to Quetta, and if so, I request that I may be informed by telegram oe returned at the Bahrain Government' s expense.

It i f ii■ It would be much appreciated If their supply could 'be expedited* There are now two Indian inrtructoro in the Lery Corps, with whoa the new Commandant Captain Goalee, is thoroughly satisfied - Arrangements are in train for the entertainment of a third instructor from India. Captain Geake has submitted proposals for a slight change in the establisiient of the Corps as proposed by Captain Campbell. The matter is under consideration and a report will be submitted in due course. The Lory Corps is necessarily an expensire item and its upkeep a considerable drain on the State reTenues* Its moral and practical ralue howerer can not be questioned and it is well recognised locally as an indisponsible necessity » Once the Corps is fully equipped and trained, expenditure can be reduced by strict economy. I see no objection to the Commandant oxercising the powers of a Commanding Officer in India, except that in my opinion any sentence of 3 months imprisonment or OTer and/or involTing dismissal from the LOTy Corps should be subject to confirmation by the Political Agent • In cases in which Foreign Subjects are concerned all sentences of ii&amp;* -prisonment should be referred to the Political Agent fori confirmation before they are carried out, and the latter should 9j.ways be empowered to try the case himself, if he thinks fit - If you concur generally with the aboTe, I will draft a few simple rules of procedure in such cases in con** -suit at ion with the Commandant and submit them for your approral.

I have told him I an not prepared to ^nti»n it to the Shaik 'but v/ould consult the Resident, vihen I v/as returning from leave I travelled ©ver iicre from Bu shire v /ith Powell of Geake's Regiment, He told me 01 r's appointment &amp; when I asked how lon^; he had taken up the x )0S ^ 1 o:r Powell said 'Only till the beginning.©f the hot weather I think, as the Regiment will want him Lack when we -0 to India/ When I arrived &amp; looked up the correspondance I found G, 01 !&lt;. had * sanctioned 1 his appointiji©nt for months, I then spoke to Geake &amp; he replied that he had never he ^n asked to take the post 1 or any delinite time &amp; had never agreed to &amp; I gathered he was not pleased with the job &amp; would probably want to ^o soon.

This I am absolutely against.He came here knowing the pay offered &amp; took over the Job from Campbell.The work consists in commanding tue Levy corps 5c ex—officio tnc Police. As regards tne lattei the _c- * cruits do a short training with Levy recruits &lt;Sc their discipline | &amp;, clothing are looked after by the O.C. Levies. He has nothing to do with their Police work. The combined jobs are not by any means a days work &amp; one of Geakc *s principal complaints is that tnere is not enough to do in Bahrain I He has taken on no mort work than v/as done by Campbell,&amp; is by no means as energetic about what he -jjtx has taken on. The comparisons drawn in jiis application «Lre absurd. In the first place it was never contemplated to attract from the Indian Army an ofiicer who might be in c©Uimand of * company,&amp; if he had any chance of getting a company command at his service(which I doubt) he was of course foolish to accept. The pay ol Captain Indian army has recently been reduced &amp; in his Regiment he wouldM not ,of course anything like R8965.

He is also not at all fond' of the system^whereby frequent changes of officers ^sriil always take place. It is most ex- pensive, as there are heavy travelling charges. The ©llicers •• 1 a w s have to overlap for more than a month hich means double pay 7 • the young Indian Army Officer without experience of such work is always bent on running the Corps like his own Regiment &amp; it tends to ^et more expensive. I am convinced,after much reflection,that tne best thing to be done for this corps would be to recruit from England,onef tne recently axed Indian Army officers,of whom numbers arc out of a job, A good man could be got for Rs 600 plus Rs 200 provident Fund with increments every three years up to Rs 1500 . Such an ollicer woulc. be a permanent official,would learn the language &amp; be i'. coi ntless ways more useful to the '3haiks govcrnrneiit than a sucession of young officers from the Indian army,at much greater expense. I understand that the Resident is likely to be away when you ^ot this,but if it is possible for you to communicate with him &amp; could put u ^ j this proposal, I would suggest that Belgrave , tiie ^dvisrp who will be coming out about the end ol this menth / could either bring out a suitable officer or at any rate# particulars of some, t© whom the appointment could then be offered. Belgrave is I think a very sound fellow &lt;&amp; would be trusted t© select the rijfit sort o: man for the Job. If I could hear from you fairly soon I should be able to wire him. I do not think it would be safe to recruit such an officer from home unless he has been interviewed by Belgrave .JOL-Xitax I saw several of thsm when I was seeking an adviser &amp; they very greatly,some are by no means what is required &amp; others ar« / ^ it is• + n&gt; f-r«m etc v-zhich I fQUiid most quite impossible to jucl^e 1 ror mi sledding.

He thinks that Belgrave if telegraphed to by him could be trusted to engage a suitable officer or to bring out particulars of several, and requests an early reply to enable him to catch Belgrave, who I think, may just be starting. -ments the other way, and he says Shaikh Kamad agrees with him as he dislikes frequent changes and also on the grounds he can cable Belgrave to bring out with him particulars of about six likely men.

B» Prideaux, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India In the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. Command of Levy Corps in the Persian Gulf. Sir, 11 1 have the honour to address you on the general question of the command of the Bahrain and Muscat Levy Corps, in view of the fact that some difficulty is experienced in obtaining suitable young officers from the Indian Army for these appointments. 2. iven after they have been obtained, it is generally found that they are not eager to stay for more than their I'irst year; they also consider themselves entitled to two while months privilege leave each year, wldrah an officer in civil employ would be more likely to accumulate his leave. 3. iidajor Daly has suggested that, in place of an Indian Army cificer, it would be better and cheaper to engage an ^ex-officer from England who would be a State servant pure and simple and would serve for a considerable period of years. I do not tare for this suggestion, as I consider it essential that the Government of India should exercise some control over these otficers, more especially in view of the fact that the Levy Corps will shortly have to perform the duties now carried out by two detachments of the Indian Infantry regiment in the Persian Gulf.—* 4. I submit for the consideration of the Government of India that it may be desirable at this juncture to post young military probationers of the Foreign and Political Department to these appointments. heir previous military training would enable them to do the Levy Corps work admirably ; they would get experience of dealing with State officials, and an opportunity for learning Arabic. At the same time they could be helpful to the Political Agent in many ways. As an analogy I can perhaps cite the officer who cornmands the Mekran Levy Corps. 5. These Commandants should hold theilp appointments as a rule for at least two years; they would then not be as expensive to the State as under the present system with its annual changes, and they would be more useful, as they would fairly know Arabic well in their second year. 6. I trust that the Government of India will be able to pass early orders on this question, as a successor to Captain Eccles has to be found for Muscat, and no names can be consid- -ered until it is known what category of officer is to hold the appointment. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ■ ^ \ I v- iD.O. /O /9/8 Th« Pelitioal A^tncy Bai rain. 1/2/26 i &gt;N BUf RESlDbiv V A 7 U T-- H- u .iOECTlAL BtCOflOS. — i m i &gt; . ^— ^atoaaBBl , yj^ Ycur D.O. 1TC. 27^3 of 27tli January.

Sir, 4 T* In reply to your letter N'o.274-S,, dated 7th August 1925, I am directed to say that, at the time when Subedar Niaz Ali Khan was first employed outside the Indian army, the necessity for obtaining Government orders sanctioning such employment on foreign service conditions appears to have been overlooked owing to the exigencies of the Great V/ar. His employment in the Bahrain Levy Corps without specific Government sanction was technically irregular and it was presumably the absence of such sanction which precluded the regimental military authorities in India from considering him for promotion to the rank of Indian officer. 2. In the special circumstances of the case the Government of India have been pleased to waive the penal interest, which is due under rule, on the Subedar , s pensionary contribution; and provided the Bahrain State are willing to pay pension contribution on his account from the date of his first appointment with the Bahrain Levy Corps, the military authorities will accord official sanction to his employment in Bahrain and will take the necessary steps with a view to his promotion to Indian commissioned rank, supernumerary to regimental establishment.

Mr. J. Parke is 55 years of age, married, and the son of a retired Colonel Parke, who commander a British Line Hegiment. He was educated at Wellington, and gasetted as a 2nd Lieutenant in 1909 to the 7th Hampshire Regiment( T.F.). He served/ln the Coldstream Guards as a probationer for one yu year in 1911, but resigned as it was too expensive. He visited India in 1912, and was the guest of Nawabsada Obaidullah Khan of Bhopal. In 1913 he went to Kast Africa in the British Kast Africa Corporation, and on the outbreakCorps till Dooembfir 1914 when he rejoined hie T* y. Regiment in India. . H^e eorved in India till 1918, being Station Staff Officer, Me^ut, for 5i years. He wa&amp; selected in August 1919 for service with the 1st Yemen Infantry, and served there for one year acting as Major and Secoad in Com* nand. 3. Hajor Baaett, the Political Agent at Jbiscat, has informed me that he did not know Mr* Parke personally, but he remembers his name well and knows that he had a good reputation. 4. Mr. I ^rJce paeoed tue following courses since the .tar — Lewis Gun, Hygiene, Machine Gun, and Senior Captain's Rifle. In September 1923 he Joined the Zanzibar Police a&amp; a cadet, anrf was in charge of the Police Lines and Military 'raining. He % was also Immigration Officer. He harassed an examination in Kiswahili, a Government Law Examination, and speaks Hindustani. He gives Lord I/iontagu of Beaulieu as a referwao^ and no doubt his confidential reports at the Colonial and Var Offices cam be referred to, 1 if necessary. 6. Mr. Belgrave, the new adviser to the Shaikh, met Mr. Harke and his wife, and stages that he seemed a capable and experienced man, and that he possesses a good working knowledge of Arabic. 6. I consider that an officer of this type might be pre* ferable to any e^-officers now in India, who have not ob* tained employment, as these latter will hardly be the best type of eji-officerj those posseseing good qualifications hav* ing nearly all found employment by now. 7. 2 think that it would undoubtedly be of adva^.tags to appoint an officer of this type to the Bahrain Levy Corps, ae he will be of assistance to the Adviser, and; if necessary, can act for him when the latter is on leave. Should the Government of India be prepared to consider Mr. Parked appointment favourably, I will maice definite recommendations regarding the terms of his agreement. 1 have the honour to be.

Dear Colonel, I hope you will excuse this method of reporting the recent events in iiahrain. I will confirm it by an oiiicial letter later if desired. At the moment I have some fever and don 1 t feel quite up to typewriting and consider this letter sent as Confidential pro tem . On Wednesday 4th about 7.15 — 7.20 a.m. I was in the Levy Corps office in the jfort. I nave recently been assist ing ^elgrave ( who has had a particularly heavy time finish ing up the year^ accounts ana getting out his first jjuaget) in the aaministrative part of the Levy work/the accounts, etc . of which had been left by Geake in glorious confusionV I was talking to the Subedar, myself sitting at the office table. A shot ran^ out, apparently in the room. I glanc ed thro* the numerous windows and saw no tiling and was about to ask the Subedar to see who had accidently fired his rifle, when I saw the Subedar jump up into a window alcove and flatten against the wall. For a moment I was still at a loss to understand the situation when I felt slight pain at the left of the head and put up my hand to find a lump out or my ear and a good deal of blood. As there were windows on all sides— all barred but open — and I was absolutely ex posed, I then also Jumped into a window alcove which would afford cover from the left, whence I imagined the bullet had come The Hobble Lieut.-Colonel P. x.. priueaux, C.b.I-j C .I .S., political 'the Persian G -ulf, ii u s h i re.come » As a matter of fact the bullet haa come from the front, passed thro* the Subedar arid then taken my ear. The man had 'been screened 'by a desk before the window under which he fired. Two more shots were fired and then silence. I was peering round from the alcove to try to locate my man when he, having crept round the back, struck me in the back with his bayonet. He was then outside the window I was in and for all I knew had more ammunition and coula shoot me through the bars. I therefore determined, as a last effort, to rush him, hoping he would lose his nerve. I accordingly yelled at him ana rushed to tne door. He also, however, ran at me ana met me before 1 was aown the two steps to the ground level. I triea to sei2ie his rifle and shouted to the guard (who had however, I afterwards heard, flea to a man iI ), out got sti?uc.£ on tne forearm doing it, turned m^ foot on the steps and fell. He jabbed at me hurriedly several times before I could rise, but I had rattled him ana he put no 'go' into it or I should not be writing this letter. Apparently while I was on the ground the other persons who had been hid ing in the room — Subedar, Clerk and another bolted out and got away into hiding in various parts of the Port. The rna.-n after sticjiing me ran off to another part of the port. There was not a soul to be seen anywhere; and I was by this time bleeding all over like the proverbial pig; ana aid not know to what extent I was damaged. l v/ent to the main guard to try t-o iind somebody, but 1 ouna only a few prisoners outside, who were wandering about (the guard over them havin^ also fled); ana lying on tne ground a Levy Corps Havilaar, who saia he was shot and d^ing. (He had oeen &amp;LOt outside the room by the las c uullex lirea. 1,either of us Deing in a position to ciiase the xugitive and a solitary Levy man having appeared from somewhere, I ascertained that nobody else had been hit (it was not then known that Niaz Ali had been hit and he had run out of the room to his qojiarters). I ordered him to trytry to fina the guard and Subedar ana catch or shoot the offender; and got the Havildar into my car and drove to the Agency Hospital. The Subedar was subsequently brought to Hospital. I luyself went to the Agency. I regret both the Subedar and Havilaar aied as reported. besides the lump out of my ear I had five bayonet wounds, fortunately none in dangerous places and none very deep. The mail was caught sitting in a corner of the port. He had finished his ammunition, which he had bougnt outsiae. This man nad previously been reauced from Naik by Qeaiie on the buoedar's charging him with continual breach of orders, etc . He had also once reported his bad behaviiuu^ to me. I imagine this was the sole cause of his running amok,. Later I uis- covered tnat he was about to oe brought up to Oraerly Boom, for the Subedar to report that he had found him in possession 01 a revolver, and that he had given another revolver to a X jsl ±riend in the Police, who had used it a few days before to shoot up the Head 01 the police one night and who was then in ±jKLjKxx lock up awaiting trial. Later, some interestixig information was 0 iven me. There is attached to the Lev^ Corps a sort of Mullah to lead the prayers. Originally they had a v/ell laiown ana perfectly harmless individual, who resigned and left ^ahrain. When I went on leave- last year they had no one*. - ./hen this new inaividual ..as uajien on I have no idea*. 1 Duly discovered his KxJi existence two days before this event and intended to enquire about him. It appears that v/hen iTiaz Ali t s funeral was being arranged, the leading Indians thought they ought to ask the corps Mullah to perform the ceremonies. He apparently accepted hall 1 -hearted -ly and they allege tried to Sccutyfe partj^of the service and ^ had to be kept up to it. They were all a bit taken aback at this. on the way back to the Port the Mullah remarked; 'There is no great cause to mourn Hiaz Ali. Some people for get the hereafter for the material benefits of this world 11 . Asked- 4 - Asked what he meant he said (this is t-he version of L.r. Ashraf, a higBLLy educated aixd well knomi Indian Loslem): 'He was always running the men in for little offences*. I as±:ed him not to report the matter of the revolver, but he would do it'; and something about 'Muslims ought to hang together'. Another version (but second hand) was that his actual words were : Vhat aid he mean by running in his brother Lioslems to be punished by a Kafir'. Ashraf is of course also a Sunni Muslim line the Mullah ana so are all the other Indians who were with him and apparently are ready to confirm what he says# Ashraf also mentions that the Mullah once complained that lliaz Ali and the Instructors did not pray behind him, but preferred to do ad it on their own. further enquiries tend to shew that it may be proved that the revolver the ciiXprit had (but did not use to shoot us — it had been taken from him, and he used his service rifle) was not long a^o the property of the Mullalij and it appears thax the accused is indebted to the Mullah and has mortgaged everything he has to him t I have purposely not pressed enquiries too far, as it is possible to guage how much influence the man may have got over these Maluchis, and it might precipitate a row» Ashraf is emphatic that the j^ullah should be aeported as he is a fanatic. It seems questionable whether he should not be put on trial. It was on discovering this situation that I wired for His Majesty^ Ship. The whole place is of course * The bazaar promptly closed qgock (now open again); and people bolted everywhere, and the Agency servants started reporting suspicious Baluchis lurking about at nights, etc . , etc ., so I thought something to steady nerves a necessity. I have a batch of naturs put on pro tem . who, I think, are reliable (in fact I don»t think there is the remotest liklihood of anybody wanting to 'go for' the Agency) and I have brought Belgrave and his wife here, as theyIV ^ - 5 - they had been living at the port bungalow since Geaice left, and it was not good enough to leave her there as she would 'be 'bound to be nervous# Trie question now to decide is the action oo oa^e on arrival H.Li.S. 'Cyclamen'. (1) Ar^s and ammunition in the Port are usually (excepx. when rifles required for parade) in a 'bolted store kept the Indian Quartermaster Havilaar. Je could choose a moment when we knew everything to 'be in store, march up a detacinaent and put a guard on the arms and then arrest the Mullah and have him put on board. If you approve oi tnis, vrxiut should then he done with him ? (2) If (1} oe carried out what should aventually nappen uo the arms and ammunition. Will it be advisable oo let the Corps carry on normally after some fev/ days ii axl appears quiet ? (5) Should the accused be removed to the Ship to prevent possibility of attempts at a forced release ? (4) How is the accused to be tried. He is a kuscat i&gt;aluch subject (I believe originally he may prove to have been a manumitted has Kegro blood in him) • _eing in the Shaikh 1 s levy it could be joint Court. Or he could be also dealt with by us, I suppose, as being under British pro tection and the persons murdered British suojects. On 'the other hand I do not see that I can have anything to do with it, having been attacked myself. Will you please let me have instructions re this ? The Shaikh would like to see the Corps disbanded and substituted for it either - Indian Aruy Keservists or pensioners; zlr or a Da^lchment from an Indian regiment about 80 strong A ^ under a good officer, for which his state would pay up to 1 lakh per axmMm. He is particularly i^een on tne latter. ^'ou may recollect tnat some months back (when the detah^uent was withdrav^i) I aa^ed if we could be assisted withwitii at least a percentage of Indian pensioners or Heservists to nave sometiiing dependable. I never had a reply to that letter that I can trace^ I am afraid the corps discipline has without doubt Mi deteriorated not improved during the last year. I shall be glad if you will let me have telegraphic instructions on the action you want taxen, when 'Cyclamen ,, arrives. I apologise for this hasty letter. Th e i^ail is waiting to close, ana I have some fever, and am not particul arly Bobust as the result of loss of blood which was fairly considerable. personally I thinic the action under suggestion (1) above could be carried out without difficulty; and if His Majesty^ Ship could stay for a time after that we could guage the effect and perhaps send off a few doubtful characters in the Corps; and we could then consider future plans at our ease. The Mullah, and accused could, if desired, be kept on board till wanted for the trial. The attitude of the local people is perfectly correct. They are in no wiae in sympathy and merely wish to see the Corps rendered less dangerous. ifiaz Ali had told me and many others that after 'cne case last year in which the accused only got four years* imprison ment for a triple murder he felt some such crimes would recur. personally I entirely agree; ana thinx that if adequate punishment had been inflicted in that case we should not have had this one I i&gt;elgrave has taicen a rough statement of evidence jsj L and accused. He and the doctor (who has him under observa tion) report him perfectly sane. He appears quite un- repenting and remarked that if only he had more anmunition he would have killed two more of the Levy — one of whom he named as having reported the revolver to the Subedar- Geake»s late orderly. This attitude rather confirms that his religiousreligious feelings may have 'been played &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; on by the kulloh. It vjould certainly appear that the latter was word ing against the Subedar. It is a pity the jLa-Lter aia not report this state 01 affairs, which must, I think, have oeen known to him.

It is true that condemnation of Bahrain Levy Corps may involve a similar fate for the Muscat Corps, but the men here have 'been 'badly selected and are in some cases coolies and even criminals. Consider men of Mekran Levy Corps of much better stamp than those allowed to come to Gulf. The following are our reasons for considering the present men should all have their services dispensed with. # (1) The majority of the men are nearly time expired and will not re-engage. (2) Though at the end of their engagement and therefore at the height of their efficiency, they are so little efficient that they all ran away when the shooting took place, including the Armed Guard. (3) Should they be retained in service, the guard and others must be court-martialled, including one Indian Instructor, if any semblance of discipline is to be maintained in the Corps. Those sentenced to imprisonipent will have to be sent to India to jail.and the Government of India may not agree to this. (4) There are now no officers or H.C.O's, Indian or otherwise, who can be relied on. (5) The Mullah has been apparently undermining all discipline. Documents have been found which cannot be translated locally, and which appear to indicate that he may be a Bolshevik Agent. (6) The Bahrain Police are also full of Muscat Baluchis similar to the criminal, one of whom shortly before attempted to murder the Chief of Police. He is a great friend of the murderer of.the Subedar. (V) Ho regret was shown by the Levy Corps at the I.O's murder and hardly anyone from the Corps attended his funeral, but thet jeered at the grief of the female relatives.&gt; v - 2 - relatives. (8) Bhai-'bandi is so thick in the Corps that no one will speak at all, not even BaluchiB hailing from the Sibi district. The Khan Bahadur has failed com pletely and thinks this is the most obstinate case he has ever tackled. He finds it impossible to make any headway. (9) The remaining Indian Instructors are in a blue funk and wish to return to India. If new ones are sent, a and the present Corps remain, the Instructors will be useless, as the Corps will treat them in a similar way, unless they do what the Corps wishes. (10) The frequent robberies in the town are now all put down to the Levies by the local people. Daly says that no Arab or Bahrain! local people are likely to enter the Corps unless they are of little or no military value. He adds that the Corps was raised not to protect Shaikh Hamad but to remove the excuse that he had no force to maintain order and could not restrain his relatives, fidawis and other Sunnis from armed attacks on his Shiah subjects. Khan Bahadur agrees with me and Daly that my opinion already expressed, that the risk of recommending the retention of even one of the present Levy Corps is too great to be taken, is correct.

Sir, I have the honour to report as follows with regard to the events happening at Bahrain connected with the recent murders which occurred in the Levy Corps there. 2. When I arrived in .Bahrain on the 11th August, ii.M.S, 11 CYCLAMEN ,, was already there. 1 found that on her arrival, she had landed at Major Daly's request, an armed guard of four bluejackets for the Agency, where there was^however, still an armed guard of the Levy Corps, and also armed watch men engaged by the police. The situation at the jj'ort was that the man accused of murdering the fciubedar was in jail under custody of the Levy Corps, who were in possession of their arms and ammunition in the ordinary way. There were three remaining Indian Army Instructors (N.C.CMs), who were also still at the Jtort, where parades went on as usual, and Mr. Belgrave, the Financial Adviser, visited almost daily. 3. H.M.S. 'TRIAD' arrived the next day ; and on the 13th plans were concerted for a force of bluejackets to land and take possession of all arms and ammunition in the Jfort. Your permission was received late that night, and early on the 14th a party landed from the ships, armed and with i^ewis Guns, marched up to the Jtort, and took possession of all arms and ammunition. Ihere was no difficulty in this, as the Levy Corps were perfectly quiet, and the bluejackets withdrew leaving one officer and an armed guard of twelve men. Subse quently to this there has been no trouble among the men of the Levy Corps, who have done their ordinary parades, but without arms, and have been allowed out of the Jj'ort during the hours between sunrise and sunset, more or less at will # 4. ihe men accused of the murder of the Subedar and of the ChiefChi of of Police, and also the Levy Corps mullah, were then placed on board the jilaval Ships for safety, and i at once pro ceeded with the trial of the murderer of the Suhedar• Having disposed of that case I dealt with those connected with the attempt on the life of the Chief of -folice. 5, After this I took up, at -a^ajor Daly^ request, a case against a man, who had written an anonymous letter threaten ing certain people with being murdered by a Secret Society said to exist. 60 I might add, in amplification of previous details which you have in your possession, that the attempt on the Chief of Police was unsuccessful. One assailant seized the Chief of -Police's companion and held him down, while the other fired two shots at the Chief of Police from one side. One grazed the flesh of the upper abdomen, .just below the ribs, furrow ing the flesh without penetrating it, and knocking him down y and the other hit a pocket book in his breast pocket and scorched his coat without inflicting any other injury on him than to knock him down again. 7. As regards the xion-Commissioned Officers of the i-evy Corps, there remain three Indian Army ^on-Commissioned Officers, as I have noted above. One I believe is overdue for leave, another has a good claim to leave, and all three/ are I understand too frightened to wish to remain longer in Bah rain. I fancy that their retention would be in the best interests of no one. As regards the Baluch jn. C.O 's , I am told that they have been very completely unsuccessful. The fact that such an unsatisfactory character as the murderer of the tnibedar could ever have been made even a paid lance-naik shows that they were hard up for men likely to make good N.C.O'b. I have the honour to be. Sir, Youe most obedient servant. Capt,,Telegram From To No. Dated the It I ''In H.M's Political Resident, iiushire. Government of India, i?* uept•,Simla* ^ r/? ^0 August 1926. Your telegram 1465/S. I have no means of proceeding to Bahrain before August 25th by mail steamer or August 31st by 'Lawrence'• But Horner has just returned and I understand situation clearly enough. It was essential that Horner, a» Sessions Judge, should go initially to try the murderer and my accompanyr ing him seemed superfluous. He has completed the trials of the murderer and of two Baluch policemen who slightly wounded Chief of Police. Trial of Mullah is deferred pending result of reference to Baghdad about Turkish and Bokharan documents found with him. I learn from Horner that — a) Baluch guard at Political Agency continued to function quietly after the outrage. (2) Belgrave daily visited the Jtort and conducted his enquiries there. Murderer was arrested by Indian N.C.O. as soon as he saw that the man had put away his rifle. (4) Murderer and the two assailants of Police Officer were kept in custody of the Levy Corps until bluejackets took over the Fort 36 hours after the arrival of TRIAP. (5) Since then the Baluchis have attended parades regularly and performed routine duties,such as ward of civil convicts, though armed with staves instead of rifleso (6) Townspeople have begun to attribute robberies to Corps but Horner does not believe them. On-2- On the other hand, there is no doubt that — (1) Mullah poisoned the minds of a large number of Levies against Subedar and Indian n.C*0 T 8 # He may be a Russian ^ Agent and have done more harm than we ]aiow # (8) There was previously a tallc of murderer cutting his name and Mullah said all must follow his lead. (3) No Levies showed or dared to show regret about the outrage, (4) Two-thirds of the men complete their period of engagement next February and will not renew it» (5) Three instructors are not worth retaining. In the circumstances I am inclined to recommend that Levy Corps be abolished and a mixed force of armed police substituted for it. Baluchis are notoriously traffickers in arms. In view of the fact that the foreign element under British Jurisdiction is so large in Bahrain, 1 think it would be well to import as quickly as possible a contingent of Indians (including as many ex-policemen as possible) to man the Jtort and the Agency guard-room, a beginning might be made with 50 • Perhaps Major Barrett who is in Karachi can assist in recruiting them. They would be under civil law and an Englishman would command the whole police force. I can order Daly to deport at least 40 Baluchis to Fasni by steamer of August S6th and possibly can arrange for another steaner to call the following week for the remainder. Or if a man-of-war escorts the mail, the whole Corps can probably be deported at once» After the departure of the Baluchis the Shaikh's personal retainers should be able to maintain order for the few weeks pending arrival of Indian police. One man -of-war, 1 hope, will be near till then. If 1 went to Bahrain I could only try to sort the sheep from the goats, a very difficult task and I think,not worth attempting.'V'lT- Telegram R # From To Foreign Simla, Resident Bushire.

The goats would then have been weeded out fairly quickly aiad better new blood would have come ill. iiow we have probably added to the professions of arms-smuggling and slaving, and made things very difficult for kuscat. * I daresay a numberof these men will goo, and enlist there 1 itfo time for more. 1 hope youare appreciating the change in the weather.

Your child has grown into a veritable Frankenstein most embarrassing to many people outside of Bahrain. You let Geake go off without the usual annual report on the Levy Corps, and i can't understand, particularly, how ne got his simple accounts into a glorious muddle.

As to your D.O. which you nave reierred to, in which you said you wanted a stiffening of reliable men, I'm afraid i didn't ta^e it seriously, as 1 had inspected the Corps only two monthi previously, and ha^ not been told at atiy otner time tnat their loyalty was in aoubt. iour main theme was a protest against the Infantry Guard being withdrawn, and that being a move definitely decided upon, it was quite useless to go up to Government about it. itisapity tnat the present case shov/s up the Shaiich^s incompetence clearly.

Karachi as I am leaving for England. He has some previous certificate from me, which state what I think of him. But I may say again that I have not altered any opinion of him. He is most loyal and reliable. As 1 am leaving for India on demobilisation 1 have much pleasure in stating the services of Jemadar Khur Hussain. He is a Head-Constable of the Sind Police, C. I. D. Karachi and was sent to the Persian Gulf in January 1916 under Major Withers. He worked in Muscat, Jask and Bushire and came under my orders in April 1918 when I reached Bushire as Intelligence Officer, Persian Gulf, bince that date he has worked directly under me. His father was lambardar of Nowshera Kalan and his elder brother holds this position now. One other brother was killed in 1915 on the N. W. Frontier while in the service of the North Staffs Regiment. 1 have found Khur Hussain to be a man of remarkable intelligence, speaking Persian, English and Hindustani as well as Pushtu ; all of which languages he can write. He possesses a high degree of personal courage which he has shown on several occasions, notably when he took service as a pretended deserter with Wassmurs and the German agents at Ah ram, at the Kinurij action and on other occac ions during the advance of the Buahire Sbrmn^ Force to Kazarnain 1918-19. ior m ritorious services in this expedition he received the honour of honorary Jemadarship in the Army, (Gazette of India, February 1919). He has a remarkable gift for engratiating himself with all classes of Persians and his popularity and success with them was unbounded. I shall always be pleased to answer any enquiries about his work and this letter contains the substance of a report I sent about him to the Deputy Inspeotoi General of Police, Sind. G. A.

A large proportion of them were not always on duty. They did one parade a day, lasting not more than two hours 9 and sometimes an hour at games etc. in the serning. While not on Duty they spent their time in the ^aaaars. The Levy Corps provided three posts of atoout six or eight men, Sitra, Kufaa, or Budalyah. These posts were visited once monthly. Con sequently men on duty on the Posts were frequently found to 'be in the liazaar at Manama. The pay of the Levy Corps man amounted altogether to almost Ks. 40/- per month together with uniform and rations. This would seem excessive. Insufficient information was obtained about the antecedents of many of the men who were enlisted. It afterwards transpired that some of them had served terms of imprisonment and some had been discharged from other units for bad conduct. Lack of a permanent Commandant was not conductive to improvements in the Corps. A number of the men spoke neither Arabic nor Persian. The Police force was paid at the same rate as the Levy Corps. Most of the men lived in the town and ■s -E- 3. and would therefore have been difficult to assemble in oase of emergenoy* It is a faot that a large proportion of the Polioe lived in brothels* The Polioe had more work to do than the Levy Corps. A large proportion of the Polioe were Persian, many of whom spoke no Arabio, there were also Saluohis among them who spoke neither Arabic nor Persian; this caused considerable complications in connection with the Police evidence etc* The Commandant of the Levy Corps was only Administrative Commandant of the Polioe and apart w4tk from dealing with their pay and rations, and supervising the training of the recruits v he had no control over them* The Police were unarmed except with truncheons* It is suggested that there is no necessity for a separate Levy Corps and Police ^orce* The duties of both could be efficiently carried out by an armed Police Force if men of a more suitable type could be enlisted* There is a strong feeling in Bahrain that a considerable proportion of any such force should consist of Sahrain subjects, these should be very carefully selected men with a stale in the country* Baluchis were generally unpopular, and Persians were unpopular among Bahrain!s*copy . ?l.

Rations costing aboutRs. 15 per mensem , and uniform will be supplied also by the State. The new force will consist of Indians and local men in the proportion of 2 to 1. One Superintendent, three Chawish and three Naiks will be Indians and will draw overseas pay in addition, respectively, at Rs.25, Rs.20 and Rs.15. The Indian Police men will draw overseas pay at Rs. 10 per mensem. 4. The force will be distributed for duty as follows 60 in the two towns of Manama and Muharaq 10 as guard for Shaikh Hamad 10 as guard for the Political Agent 40 at outposts — Budaiya, Rifa, Sitra, &amp;c. 30 in reserve at the Fort. It is proposed that Mr.^elgrave should visit Karachi about the third week of October to inaugurate the recruit ment of the Indian contingent. 5.

Sir, 1 have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with my telegram Bo. 546, dated the 50th August 1926, on the subject of lawlessness in Bahrain# and to report that I proceeded to that island on the 2nd September and remain* ed there till the 19th September* 2. The telegram, mutilated in transit# from the political Agent which caused me to go orer was as follows :- 29th August. 'Anonymous letter receired threatening lires of Adriser, Director of Customs and myself. This evening attempt made on ftgency Interpreter and Persian policeman with him^shot. Persian naturs appear inadequate. wounded policeman states assailant Baluch employed by shaikh, who is related to man in Levy Corps.' 5. then I asked Major Daly for the details of this case he replied that he had no further information. As the result of my own enquiries# partly made on the scene of the outrage# the following facts were elicited. 4. There is a police double-sentry^ post at a street corner about 30 yards from the Agency Interpreter's house. Ths Interpreter# a Persian# issued from his house at 9 p.m. toi/el to attend a religious meeting. Me turned the comer and a policeman walked a few steps with, him* A par ^ o^. pedestrians approached them $ and the other sentry called out 'See who they are'. The policeman talking to the Interpreter put his hand on the ana of one of the men^ who called out 'Shoot hi*', and one of the other three men at once fired a pistol putting a bullet through the policeman^ shoulder. The Interpreter holted and tried to take refuge in the nearest house until his women folk came out and escorted him home. iie then, it is saidy fired a number of rounds from his reyolrer into the air I The four pedestrians, who may hare been contemplating a burglary, fled in a different direction. The injured policeman thought that he recognised one of them as a rent-collector of Shaikh Hamad*s, who with san^ - froid presented himself in the ordinary way in Mr Belgrare's office the next morning. No action has been taken against him. i'rom this account it is apparent that no attack was made or contemplated against the Agency interpreter. This man has since the first outrage been one of the chief alarmists in the Agency entourage. 5. 1 enquired also into the circumstances of the first outrage which ocurred on August 2nd. 1 learnt that at 10.50 p.m. the Chief of police started on a tour through the low quarters of Manamah town. Me was followed by one policeman, Ghulam All, a Minabi Persian. Me met a Mekrani policeman, named Muhammad Kunarl, who said that he had been bathing and was going to the bazaar police station. The Chief ordered him also to follow. Qhulam Ali disappeared after the party had taken a turning, and it subsequently transpired that he was jumped on and knovked down by a lurking Baluch, police-lance-Naik Murad. Muhammad Kunari fired two pistol shots at the chief. OneOne bullet made a Alight wound in Ms side and the other struck a notevbook in the Chief's pocket. the assailant f probably tniniULng txiat he had billed tne Chief ran off and appeared at the police station where he lay down and feigned sleep* The Chief lost a good lot of blood 9 but got ad mittance into a hut, whence he was erentually ta^en by motor to the Agency Hospital. The first policeman to appear on the scene was Lance-Kaik Murad. Mis behariour is described as peculiar at first when he was ordered to arrest Muhammad iiunari, but after a time he blew his whistle and other policeappeared* Muhammad &amp;unari had fire times been punished by Captain Geake on reports of the chief* He had been fined Rs* 15 and Rs* 50 and imprisoned for 8 days* it is easy to understand that jcHxk this Baluch was animated by hatred of his Chief* The other man was his friend and played a minor part in the out rage* .Both men were tried by Captain Morner and w«re sentenced to adequate terms of imprisonment* 6* With regard to the Levy Corps H amok w case, it has transpired that Subedar Atiaz Ali hao. become yery unpopular through petty acts of tyranny* When the nucleus of the jorps was collected in Muscat about Jreuruary 19^4 Captain Alban had undertaken to recruit the men. Me, howerer, rexy soon at terwards leit Muscat and all the recruiting was done by Sia* Ali, who it is said, leyied Rs. 5 from each recruit. Later# whenever parties were sent on outpost duty, ^ias Ali robbed them of a portion of their rations. In June 1926, when Japtain Geake rejoined his regiment, preparatory to taking leave, Hiaz Ali was able to make more hay. The Havildar, who was mardered, was his near relative * the other three Indians were all collected from the sa-ne district of the Punjab* 7. ine murderer had no real cause for entertaining so much i i^aLred ne lelt for the Indian instructors — he has been expressing his regret that he was unable to kill a third man-- ^ut the temperament and disposition of the Gulf Baluchi, whether he comes from Mekran or from Museat, seem to bexery similar to thoae of the Moplah of Malabar. 8* It was suggested that a Mullah, who had attached himself to the Corps unoffieially about three months ago # was deliberately fostering a spirit of mutiny and disloyalty* There is no oonorete evidence in support of this charge• The man undoubtedly disliked Subedar Kiax All, but there could not hare been any open quarrel between them or the fast would have been reported* The Ibillah came to Bahrain in July 1924 from Iraq* He lived with the Chief ^asi and worked as a schoolmaster* Me went to Iraq with a Bahrain Certificate of Identity in 1925 and returned in 1926 when the ^axi refused to re-employ him* Trom Iraq it is stated that he was considered to be of weak intellect* None of his papers, which were sent up to Baghdad for examination, are considered to be of a dubious character* The man has now been deported to India and the Sind authorities have been informed about him* 9* The Bahrain Levy Corps last month contained 125 Oulf Baluchis out of a total of about 135 native ranks* The town Police force eontained 61 Baluohis out of about 89 men* There are many Baluchis still employed in the Customs Depart ment; seme ef the Agency chuprassis are Baluch, and many Arab, Persian and Mindu merchants employ Balueh watchmen* These men cannot be dismissed as they bear good characters and have performed long service* 10* Since the 186 Baluehis (Levy and Felice) were deported, robberies and burglaries have not by any means ceased* I heard of twe raids on date gardens and a case of shop-break- Crunv .

Soae of thi offendere in Bahrain are douhtlee. Sajdie, negroee and prebah- ly also Iraqie.

The mtn were too highly paid and not suffioientlj worked. I an afraid that the super* Tision oyer them was not latterly as olose as it should hare 'been| with the result that they spent mush of their tiHe 9 day and night 9 in brothels. The Corps was too homogenous in race, and l»eing poorly disciplined foreign mercenaries they took adrantage of their power* I do not think that there was any religious fanatieisa behind their misl^haTiour* The two English merchants, the three American missionaries and the Hindus with whom I dis* cussed this questien # all scouted this suggestion* 12. The new Police force, which is to be raised, will hate many different elements in it« The Indian contingent will, I hope, be amenable, better disciplined and mere courageous than were the Baluoh Leries.

They are unlikely to go astray as they have been working under the direct supervision of Belgrave and under the general supervision of the Military Recruiting Officers, and the characters of all the recruits are being carefully verified. I am not aware that these men did not wish to take part in the execution of the Baluch murderer, ^s a matter of fact they did the actual trussing up and blind- folding of the murderer jittG* to his execution, and I have no doubt they would have formed part of the firing party if ordered. The question was whether Hawaldars as such should form part of the actual firing party.

The services of Lt.R.C.Robinson 1 s detachment have been invaluable both to the Bahrein Government and to this Agency. Lt. Robinson himself has been particularly zealous and at the same time tactful in the discharge of his duties and I am sure that the departure of these extremely efficient and well- behaved troops will be sincerely regretted by all the inhabit ants of these islands. The final batch of the armed Police force is expected to arrive at Bahrein about 1st January and as the whole of the Indian portion of the new force consists of ex soldiers and ^ policemen their training is a simple matter. The up-keep of this i orce in addition to the cost of the Detachment on the 3/16th Punjab Regiment puts a heavy strain on the finances of the Bahrein Government. I recommend, therefore, that the Indian IIndian Army Detachment should be relieved as soon after the middle of January as may be convenient to the kilitary Authorities in India, I have the honour to be.
