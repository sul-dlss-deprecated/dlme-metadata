Specifically, the file contains correspondence concerning a (failed) attempt by the Persian Inspector General of Customs to land at Bahrain, discussions as to whether Persia should be allowed to open a consulate in Bahrain, the Persian Government's appeal to the League of Nations in Geneva and broader discussions concerning the history of Bahrain, Persia's claim to it and the composition (and size) of the Persian community in the country.The file contains a number of translations of articles from the Persian press that criticised the British role in Bahrain (and the Gulf more broadly). It also contains a cutting from an article published in London's 'The Evening Standard' (f.113) that attacked Persia's attitude towards the issue.On ff. 188 - 196, the file contains a summary of all the papers then contained in the records of the Government of India that related to the sovereignty of Bahrain from 1819-1870.A report on the composition of the Persian community in Bahrain (written by the Political Agent in Bahrain, Charles Geoffrey Prior) is contained on ff.74 - 78.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>National Economy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rights of states</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arab nationalism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Social reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00014a#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00014a#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00014a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00014a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
