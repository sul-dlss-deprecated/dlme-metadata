Dear Mr. G-ibson, I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter P.Z.6467/4J of the 3rd instant concerning the present whereabouts of Mr. j.P.Eanneford. The only information obtainable from the records of the Company in London, is as follows:- Mr. Eanneford left for England on his three-yearly leave in J uly last by the overland route. i* Italy entered the War and he hadto return to Bahrain and he proceeded from Bahrain to Durban by way of Bombay. The latest information on the file here is that he was in Durban with his wife and son. There is nothing on the file to indicate that Mr. Kanneford^ employment with the Company has been term inated and it is therefore presumed that after his three months f leave he returned to Bahrain.
