Cordon, 1918.’ -Epitome.—The route may be considered in 2 sections.— (a) Robat to Bam. (&amp;) Bam to Kerman. (a) A very fair motor road has been made as far as Dehan-i- Baghi; latest information, however, indicates that this had been washed away and that the last 5| m . G f stage 7 was at present (1 May 1918) impossible for ’car®; while the route from that place to Bam is also pass able by motors, the distance having been traversed by motors in 3 days with very little difficulty. During winter and spring one battalion with camel transport is the maximum force which could use this route. In summer and autumn not more than one company could move at a time and this onlv with difficulty. From the point of view of a battalion on the march, the ■stretch of 88 miles between the foot of the hills between Gura and Nasratabad Sipi and Fahreh would be difficult even in the cold weather, and almost impossible in the hot. Extra camel transport with pakhals would have to be provided,' and parties would have to be sent ahead from Kunarak spring to Kahurak, from Kahurak to Shurgaz and from JShurgaz to Tum-i-Rig to dig wells and fill pakhals from them j the flow of2 Route No. I — contd. water at these places being too slow to supply the needs of a battalion with an extra large amount of transport in a reason able time. At any time of year also a force is liable to be overtaken by one of the terrible sandstorms of the desert, which make it impossible to move for hours at a time. Supplies are practically nil at Nasratabad Sip : , and absolutely non existent between that place and Fa hr eh 5 every extia day spent on the march, therefore, would mean additional transport for supplies, and this again would mean a larger consumption of water. In the summer the intense heat ot the desert would necessitate an abundance of water both for men and animals,, especially if the much-dreaded hot winds were blowing. (b) This section is passable by motors in dry weather. Water. —(a) For details see under stages. The difficult stages are 9 and 10. The former, even if the route is taken via Kahurak (see stage 8), involves a march of some 31 miles, during which water cannot be found. In stage 10 ample water can be obtained by digging at Tum-i-Rig, the water though salt being drinkable. Any large party traversing the Dasht-i-Lut should take with it ordinary picks, shovels, galvanized iron or leather buckets and rope, and a small advance party should be sent three or four days ahead to dig fresh wells, and to clear out the springs. Large Persian “ Raviahs 'i made of leather to be carried on mules or camels, the latter for choice, should accompany the party. One “ Raviah ” full of water should suffice for ten men per diem, during the cooler season, Novem ber—April. (&amp;) No difficulty in this section. Fuel. —(a) Plentiful at all stages except 9 and 10. (6) See under stages. Fodder. —(a) Ample camel grazing. The surra fly is leported to be prevalent between Dehan-i* Baghi and Shurgaz, especially at Gurg, at which place they are so numerous that camel grazing is impassible during the day.

The famous Mil-i-Nadiri, a tower 55 feet high, is passed at 17 m. standing in the midst of an absolutely bare, level plain. At 23 m. Tum-i-Rig is reached. Water from brackish wells. An unlimited supply could be obtained by digging. At 30 m. cultivation is reached and at about 32 m. a large ruined fort is passed about J m. to the right. At 35 un. Fahreh. The village consists of a few mud huts situated under a curious conical hill, some 40 feet high. It lies on the bank of a water-course some 200 yards broad and full of reeds and grass ; the latter would provide unlimited fodder for mules, donkeys and cattle. Much cultivation is to be seen across the water-course, and extending away in the distance in the S. W. The whole village, including portions on both banks, consists of some 200 huts with 1,000 inhabitants. Water. —Unlimited supply of sweet Water. Fuel. —Obtainable. Fodder. —Very good grazing.

The track is broad and well-marked and for the first 8 miles passes scat tered villages and cultivation. It follows the line of telegraph poles the whole distance. At about 8 miles, the village of Valilabad, supplies abundant, is passed and a flat plain is entered. The track follows the left bank of a brook, the Jub-i-Vakllabad containing an abundant flow of water, and marked in the whole length of its course by the trees and shrubs on its banks. At 22 miles, a low range of mud hills is reached. The large scattered village of Burak is here passed marked by an extensive grove of date palms. Passing through the mud hillocks a perfectly flat treeless plain is crossed till Bam is reached. This is a sriiall town of 12,000 inhabitants, with a mean bazar and a telegraph office. There is a Persian Governor and a small garrison. The camping-ground is unlimited, the best place being in rear of the telegraph office. Water .—Water abundant and excellent from kdrize's.

For the first four miles the road is the same as that in the last stage, the route being retraced asn 8 Route No. I— contd. far as Khwaja-i-Askar. Thence the track lies up the valley. At 7J miles the road begins to cross diagonally the water course, which is here broad and ill-defined, and reaches the further side at 8 miles. At 11 miles, there are the ruins of an old mud fort about a quarter of a mile to the left, and about half a mile further on there are similar ruins to the right. From here there is a deep and wide fissure on the left of the road. At 15 mile/, Darzln is reached, a small, dirty caravanserai with a few houses. Water .—From a good stream. Fuel .— Fodder .—Grazing plentiful. Supplies .—A few supplies procurable. 14 TLHRtJD .. 22| m. General direction N. ~ W. The route lies over a bare stony plain. The low hills forming the tail end of the Kuh Kafut are some six or seven miles off to the right. At .Hi miles &gt; a tra ck branches off to the left to Sarvistan and i mmediately beyond, the road crosses a dry water-course run ning from the right rear. At 12J miles the low hills to the . “ght terminate in a group of black rocky hillocks close to the road. At 14J miles, the small village of Abariq is passed, ymg about half a mile to the right of the road. About the same distance to the left are the ruins of an old fort on a mound. There is a considerable extent of land under cultivation here. Immediately behind the village rises a rocky hill which has been visible early in the march, coming into sight soon after quitting Bam. The road passes close to the left of this hill, which is called the Kuh-i-Abariq, and a gentle ascent begins’ tne crest of a slight kutal being reached at 16J miles. From this point the direction is W.-by-N. with a slight fall and the lowest pointy of the grade is reached half a mile beyond, on rounding a low spur from the Kuh-i-Abariq. The direc tion then becomes more northerly, and there is an open valley some three-quarters of a mile wide to the left with a strong stream of good water flowing through it. The track leads to a narrow defile at the head of this valley, which is passed at9 Route No. l—contd. divides into several channels, and the road emerges into an. other valley, or plain, still closed on the right by the high ridge ° f ^ -Kdh-i-Abariq, and stretching away to a long distance on the left. At about 20 miles, a small village lies some three- quarters of a mile to the left. The name is said to be Kan-i- Khatun. Half a mile beyond, the track begins to enter the cultivation of Tehrud, and passes some ruins on a small mound to the right. Much of the land is flooded by irrigation chan nels. There are several enclosed gardens scattered about the plain. At 22J miles the caravanserai is reached, a large strag gling place, but very dirty. Tehrud is the name given to a group of village scattered over about 4 miles of country ; some of these are in ruins, but Kan-i-Khatun, Abariq and Kush-i-Palang are inhabited (Stewart 1906). Water. —Plentiful. Supplies .—Easily procurable. 15 IviABID .. 27 m. General direction N W. Up to 8 or 9&gt; _ miles, the route lies along the bed of the Ab-i-Shur, the telegraph line taking a separate course on higher ground so as to avoid floods. To the N. E. of the road is a high steep chain of scarlet hills. Further on the road is everywhere shut in by bare, bleak hills, except for a short distance, where, to the south, the peaks of the Kuh-i-Hazar and the Jamal Bailz are seen. After crossing several empty water-courses, the track descends a long range of gravel hills down to the caravanserai of Nabid which is stone built, but in a very bad state of repair. Note.—A cross-road connects Nabid with Guk, stage 2, Route I ( c ) It runs across broken ground to the Guzar-i-Guk, at 9 miles, where there are a spring of good water and some willows. Thence by what is described a rather difficult pass to large village of Guk, which is reached at 19 miles. Water .—Water from a spring and small stream of brackish dirty water.

For the first 7 79 miles, the road is over a perfectly bare flat plain with occasional villages dotted about on it at some distance from the road. The number of karizes is also remarkable, but the fact that the majority of them are disused and choked with sand show that the country must have been much more highly cultivated formerly than it is now. At 8 miles, a very fertile tract is entered with villages in every direction and with abundance of water and cultivation. At 12 miles, after crossing a kacha-pakka bridge over a stream covered with high reeds and grass in a ndld, some 50 yards wide, the village of Rustamabad is reached. ALTERNATIVE STAGES (B).

An alternative track, hy which it can be avoided, leads off to the left from Muhammadabad towards the skirts of some low hills, making a considerable dtour and rejoining the direct road at 20 miles. Here a wide track of cultivation and irrigated land begin after which the road continues over gravel slope?, winding amidst rounded hills, till it suddenly emerges out of a ravine into the midst of the cultivations round Rayin.

The first , . 4 seven miles lie across a plain. At 1 mile, a stream from a line of qandts is crossed, and then the slopes of the Kuh-i-Askaru are climbed. From here the, road winds along wide valleys and across shallow ■ravines under gently sloping hills of gravel. At about 15!14 Route No. I— ontd. miles, a ruined caravanserai is reached, where there is a spring of good water behind the hill to the east. After leaving the- cdravdnserai the ascent of the pass begins but it is so gradual that the crest is passed at 18 miles almost before one is aware of it. The descent towards the north is as gradual as the ascent. There is a caravanserai at Hanaka, situated in a rather dreary valley, just above some patches of cultivation. In winter there- are not more than a dozen people living in the place. Stage is passable by motors. Water. —Water is sweet and good. Fuel .— Fodder. —Forage obtainable in limited quantity.

W. ... ^. The track leaves the village in a westerly direction over gradually rising and undulat- ground. The top of the rise is reached at two miles from which a well cultivated valley, dotted with three or four hamlets, can be seen ahead. The road to Hanaka away to the IS., can also be seen from this point; probably at no point is this road more than about 5 miles distant from the Gudar route. At 3^ miles the valley is reached and the first of the three hamlets, all bearing the name of Garak, is passed about half a mile to the N. At 5|- miles the third hamlet is passed, and the valley ends half a mile further on. This valley would make a good alternative halting place instead of Rayin for troops. Water.—-Qood and plentiful from a stream. Fuel .—Fair supply. Fodder .—.Grazing good. Supplies .—Grain in moderate quantity. From the end of the valley the track leads straight on to an opening between two small hills and at miles a warm water spring with two small ruined hamams (baths) is passed. At 8 miles the opening referred to above is reached, and from here the track continues over undulating country, without passing any other habitation, until Gudar is reached at 17 miles. The track the whole way from Rayin to Gudar is fit for wheeled traffic. Gudar is only a small hamlet, situated in a half ruined fort, but there is a fair amount of cultivation around, and a good and plentiful supply of water from a large stream.

The track leaves the SANG. village in a north- 29 erly direction, and makes towards the hills. The pass through them, Gudar-i- -Gudar, begins at 2 miles and is fit for wheeled traffic except for about \ mile on each side of the summit where it is very rocky and where the gradients are very steep. This piece of road would need blasting before carts could be taken over it. The rest of the road to Karavansarai-i-Sang is fit for wheeled traffic but is very stony and bad going for animals, especially for horses and mules. Up to 6 miles the road proceeds up the left bank of a large stream, but at this point the stream is left. The top of the pass is reached at 81 miles and from this point the track winds downwards till the Karavansarai-i-Sang is reached. It is only a small hamlet, with a ruined caravanserai, but there is a certain amount of cultivation around. ^ Water .—Good and plentiful from a stream. Fuel .—Fair supply. Fodder .—Grazing fair.

W. 44 The road leaves the hamlet in a northerly direction over a small pass which ends at 1 mile. The pass would need repairs, probably blasting, before being fit for wheels, for about J mile on each side of its summit. The rest of the road to Mahun, though very stony and bad going for animals, is fit for wheels except for stretches of 100 yards or so here and there, which would need repairs. From the end of the pass the track winds in and out among low hills, until 7 miles is reached. Here on the E. side of the road there is an enclosure for the cultivation of lucerne. From this point Mahun can be seen in the valley below, and further off on the horizon, Kerman ; also the track from Hanaka, here marked by a line of trees to the E.

The track keeps about J mile to the W. of the rocky bed of the Karvandar river which is here in places less than 20 yards broad and quite impassable for any form of transport. Crossing several nalas at 10| miles the track reaches the right bank of the river and proceeds through the Karvandar gorge for some 3 miles. The river bed is in places only 20 yards broad, the banks being formed of high, rocky and, for the most part, inaccessible hills.

The track runs 1474 across the Teghaf plain for \\ miles?- At 3 miles the track enters the bed of the river along which it runs till 4£ miles. Here the river bed is 4 mile broad, with steep banks, 10 to 15 feet high. A few huts and a Icariz known as Shahdad is passed. The track runs parallel to the river over level ground, through cultivation and kikar trees. At 6 miles the track skirts a spur known as Gatmiran, the summit of which, shaped like a haystack, forms a prominent landmark. Running over an open plain at 9 miles the track descends the right bank of the Karvandar river and passing a cliff, 50 feet high, known as Kam Taftan, follows the bed of the river, which varies in width from 400 to 800 yards, over good going •over shingle to Damia at 18 miles. Damla is a mud fort, some 40 yards square, in very bad repair, with walls 40 to 50 feet high. To the South is a cluster of some 20 mud huts, connected to the fort by a mud wall in the last stage of dilapidation. Damjn is really the name of the district, consisting of eight villages, but the fort is also known as Damin, although its proper name is Kaleh-i-Kuram. The inhabitants are Shambani BaluchL.

It is 215 yards square, with towers in each corner and a large gateway facing S. E., and loopholed all round with a parapet running round the walls. There are several’ guns which formerly belonged to the Persians, not formidable weapons now. The fort is impregnable to rifle fire, and the walls too thick for small guns to have much effect. There is good cover on the N. to within 200 yards near the old ruined fort but on other sides none within 500 yards. There are two villages close to the fort, both small and chiefly of mud and wicker huts, and a large area of cultivation wheat and jowari with some barley, beans and minor crops on karezes. With decent government, the cultivation all through the valley could be greatly extended. The population is ■depressed and entirely at the mercy of Mir Bahram Khan’s followers. Many of the cultivators belong to the Rais tribe Camping ground.—The best is about £ mile S. E. of the fort, on hard ground, close to several water-courses, unlimited in area. Water.

There are three 1£0| tracks of which the easiest but longest, after running through cultivated land,, sometimes slippery for camels where irrigated, crosses the Bampur river below Makan Khan (about a foot of water in the ford in December 1916), and running over sandy ground at a short distance from the river, re-crosses the river at about 13 miles through thick jungle, and so to Bampur. The most northern track apparently is also easy, and keeps through thickly wooded country, for the most part above the level of cultivation. The middle track, which is very troublesome for camels during irrigation periods, leaves the northern track at about 1 mile and passing through a jungle of babul and other trees, inter spersed with cultivation reaches the river bank at the dam above Mirquazi at about 6 miles. Passing the village of Nasiri the track runs along the river bank, finally rejoining the northern track at about 16 miles. Bampur fort is at 17 miles. The fort stands on a low mound about 500 yards long in the bare open plain, and is a picturesque building, but its walls are rather shaky, and in its present condition it could not long be defended, even if the necessary number of men were available. Until the end of 1915 it was in the hands of Sardar Said Khan of Geh, having come into his possession as Deputy Governor under Persian rule, and being retained by him when the Persians disappeared. It was then taken from him by Mir Bahram Khan of Bampur, who bribed the custodians to admit him without a struggle. Camp. —On open ground S. of the fort, unlimited.

The lower part of this route, through the Bampusht range to Purchinan Daf, and thence in Baluchistan, through the Zamaran hills and the Kech valley, is impassabe for wheels, and the con struction of a road would be an engineering work of some mag nitude. The development will undoubtedly take a different course. A road which will ultimately be fit for motors is already in course of construction from Pasni via Turbat to Panjgur. From Panjgur to Grawag and thence by Route 3 to; Dehak and on by Route No. Ill (c) to Dizak, there is no Kutal to cross nor any engineering difficulty of any importance, while an alternative route from Dehak to Sib (Route No, 3) and on through Pashuk by route No. IV (n) would be almost equally easy and in some ways preferable ; both are now practicable for field guns with a small amount of labour. For ordinary caravan traffic stages 1 to 6 of this route, from Purchinan Daf to Dizak, with the branch (Route IV (i) ) from Sar-i-Jangan to Sib are of much importance. The Kalgar pass in stage 3 is not only the easiest pass through the Bam pusht range, it is the only one for a long way which is prac ticable for camels. Route 111(a), via the Chitkani Pass, is shorter and therefore much used by donkey caravans, but not tit for camels, and stage 5 of route IV (k) is little, if at all, better. The worst parts of the Kalgar Pass have been improved, and are from time to time repaired by passing caravans, and offer no serious obstacles to camel or mule transport though it is desirable, when going N., that camels should not be very heavily laden.

At once turn N.-W. up the Gwalagh Kaur and at miles ascend the steep right bank 25 feet on to a level plain, the Gwalaghi Dan. At 3 miles the track to Maindar via the Chitkani Pass {see Route III (a)) branches off to the right. Descend into the Gazen Kaur, a wide open valley, 41 miles.

The track ascends the stony bed of the Kalgar Kaur the whole way, crossing the stream frequently. The valley is for the most part 70 to 100 yards wide, but contracts to 15 yards at some of the gates where the stream breaks, with many windings, through the hills which run E. and W., parallel to each other at right angles to its general course. For the first four miles there is little water on the surface except at these gates, the first of which is just above the camping ground. Above it the Garri Kaur comes in from the N. At If miles another range of hills. At 2 J miles a footpath branches to W. through the hills to Bughan. About 3J miles Hanar Kash, an open space fit for a camp on the left bank. At 4 miles the Tahlap Kaur comes in from the W. Above it another range of hills, and above that a wide open space called Sabfuli Dafak. A foot path runs west up the Sabful Kaur to Gilok. At 4f miles Dar Tank, the great gate where the stream issues from the main ranges into the foothills. Just below the gorge is a very good camping ground (100 x 70 yards) on the right bank, where it is convenient to halt if it is desired to combine the first three stages into two. About this point the ascent becomes steeper. At 6 miles a deserted kalag above which the stream breaks through the Dazin Kuh.

Passing through another wall of rock, the track reaches the mouth of the Mangi Kaur, coming in from the W., up which lie the small kalags of Mangi, Nadukan and Khushapi, where there are generally a few families of graziers, from whom small quantities of milk may be obtained by local guides, but the people are shy. A very difficult track leads through the hills to Purkan (see Route IV (h) ). The little kalag at the mouth of the Mangi Kaur is called Kalotu, but the space available for a camp is very small and it is better to go on fully half a mile to a strip of level ground on the right bank, perhaps 150 yards long and 50 feet broad, with one willow- and two poplars.

For about 5| miles up there is generally a little running water, but not enough to be trouble some : at places the water disappears altogether. A little above camp, a small group of self-sown date trees. At 4 miles a small stream comes in from the E. The main valley is full cf tamarisk and grass. The hills on either side are precipitious and crumbly, from 300 feet to 1,000 feet above the river bed. At 5 miles a waterfall, round which the track passes without difficulty. A little further on a very small but much used camping ground. At 6 miles a sheer wall of 10 feet in the river bed; the truck round this wall is practicable for camels but could easily be improved. About 6f miles two steep places, each about 50 feet long, climbed by a zigzag track in fair repair! 7 miles, after passing for 100 yards along a narrow ridge with fine view over the Nihing valley, as far as the Kech Band near Tump, the summit of the Kalgar Pass (4,800 feet) which is theRoute No. Ill — contd. watershed between the Gulf of Oman and the Mashkel internal •drainage system. A little further on the view to the north, from Kuhak to beyond Dizak and Sib, open's out. A low hill just above the path would make a good signalling station. The track follows the crest of the ridge for a short distance with the higher summits of the Bampusht range to E. and W., -and descends by a stony slope into the Khanan Kaur, 8 miles. Gontinning N.-E. down this Kavr, at 8| miles join the Sar-i- Jangan Kaur and turn W. 300 yards on the camel track follows the stream to N.-W. while a bridle path goes over a tow ridge, with a steep descent on the west side and rejoins the stream, now flowing S.--W. in a narrow rocky bed between cultivated fields. Overhanging trees and weed in the stream make this part of the road troublesome for camels. Just above the village a footpath leads over the hills to the camping ground, while the main track follows the stream, with the village (about 4,450 feet) on the right, to tire bottom of the cultivation, where another small stream comes in from the S.-W., and then turns abruptly to N.-E. to camp. The inhabitants are friendly. The Sardar Yaili Khan, also called Mir Alian, Durazai Rind, is a man of considerable influence on both sides of the Bam pusht range.

Thence there are apparently two tracks, one going on down the Sar-i-Jangan Kaur, and the other crossing a low- shoulder into the Malebar Kaur and descending it as in Route. I \ (i), stage 2. The two tracks meet further on ; guides are of course necessary through this broken country. The latter track, on leaving the Malebar Kaur passes, miles 3 to 4|, through low hills, and then along the Madagan Kaur.

After leaving 309J the main route at mile 1, the route passes a bug on the right, and then leaves the Duzdap plain, passing through some low hills into a ndld, which contained water in March 1918. This is the ndld which passes Chamagh. The route follows it down to mile 2J, where the Lar river is reached, at a place called Suto where there is tamarisk and Icirtalc grass. Then for 7 miles the route proceeds due N., sometimes in the dry river bed, sometimes on the daman on its right bank. At mile 9J, the river turns off to the right, in a thick jungle of tamarisk, while the road passes over a stony dasAf until a small pass, in the middle of hillocks of all colours,- is reached at mile 11. A rather difficult descent is met with, followed by a ndld which forms the base of an obtuse-angled triangle, one side of which is the bottom of the Lar Koh, the apex being a point near the Gudar Kasur, up to which the plain slopes at about 3°. Batambar spring, near the E. corner of this plain, contains very little water. It is noticeable from far off by the patch of white ground about it. Camping ground stony. A small amount of fuel.48 Route No. Ill— contd. 23 ROBAT .. 23 m. General direction 322J E.-N.-E. The road goes N. to the Gudar Kasur at SJ miles. The road is stony and difficult for camels. The descent from this pass is even more so. The ndld in the bed of which the road runs is tortuous and choked with boulders, and although for a mile or so the road leaves it and goes over the dasht to the right, yet this is bad going for camels on account of rocks and steep descents. The ndld is reached again at mile 5!, and a gorge, with cliffs 20 or 30 feet high, is passed. The road finally leaves the ndld about mile 8, crosses some undulating ground, and reaches another ndld on the E. about mile 9. This ndld is followed till the Shamadar is met about mile 11. Robat is reached at mile 14. ROUTE No. IV.

A working party, sent ahead daily, would be very useful for removing minor obstacles. The first three stages (35 miles) are over the lowlying country bordering the coast. These three stages are based on informa tion which is somewhat vague. The wide stony river bed or its neighbourhood is then followed via Sarbaz for nearly 140 miles, to the watershed over which there are several alter nate passes, on the N. W., there is a gradual and easy descent to Bampur, via Fahreh (or Fehruj). Climate .—The hot season lasts from the middle of April to the end of October. During this period the climate is very trying and unhealthy in the low-lying coast belt. Under canvas it is too hot for Europeans to sleep by day, and wherever water exists mosquitoes and other insect pests make rest at night impossible, without curtains. This part of the route is practically impassable for European troops in the hot season. During the cold season the climate is pleasant. There are occasionally light falls of snow on the higher portions of the route, and heavy rain generally falls between January and March. Transport .—Camels and donkeys are the only means of transport employed by the local inhabitants. Most of the local camels are only capable of carrying 3 to 4 maunds. See also Route 5 epitome, the remarks in which on the subject of trans port apply generally to this route also. Physical obstacles .— (i) The crossing of the Dashtiari river in the first stage. No details available. It may be possible to avoid this crossing, by disembarking in Gwatar Bay on the east side of the mouth of this river. (ii) The Bagani kutal (stage 7). This is a very minor ob stacle. The summit is only 947 feet above sea level. The ascent to this kvtal, on the southern side, for 440 yards, has a gradient of ^ up a ndla 5 feet wide, with steep slopes on both sides. Gun wheels would, in places, ride 2 feet higher than the track, unless some pioneer work were undertaken. (Hi) The Sarbaz ta?igi or defile (stage 12). For about 6 miles the track follows the river-bed, of shingle and shale 80 to 100 yards wide, between high precipitous50 Route No. IV — contd. cliffs. The going is quite goodj but there would be no passage if the river were in flood. (iv) The watershed between the Sarbaz and Bampur basins (stage 14 of main route). The alternative passes are (a) Kikam Panchu (main route), (6) Kulanl (alternative (B)), (c) Mardukan (alternative C) and (d) Bukuh (alternative D). The Kikam Panchu appears to be the most direct, but the Persians, have taken wheeled artillery across the Kulani and Bukuh. There is no information regarding the on ward path after the Bukuh Pass is crossed. (v) The chief obstacle, throughout this route, is the slow and heavy going along the stony river-bed. Stages 10, 11, and 12 are the worst in this respect. Alternative stages (A) from Sigari to Sirja via Rimdan. This way is longer and does not seem to offer anv advantages. (B) (C) (D) see (iv) above.

At mile 5 pass the hamlet of Barau, at mile 6J the hamlet of Baradan, and at mile 7J reach the village of Shaikh Chah, where Route IV (b) is crossed. At Shaikh Chah there are sixty-three wells of good and sweet water, which supply the neighbouring hamlet and are much frequented. Depth of wells 30 feet. There are a number of fine trees and much brushwood in the vicinity. Continuing across a level plain, covered Vith low scrub jungle, Balur Mach is reached at mile 13. Here there are extensive palm gi’oves, which indicate a plentiful water supply. On the west side of Balur Mach there are extensive stretches of neglected fields, which have been abandoned since the Bahu river changed its course to a bed about 5 miles further towards the west.

On the right (west) bank there is a prominent hill called Kaleh Zangi Kuh (420 feet). At mile 8 reach Bahu Kalat, situated on the left (east) bank of the Bahu river, the bed of which is here about 190' wide. The country round Bahu Kalat is owned by Hots, under Mir Yar Muhammed, Rinds, connections of those in Hand, and Jagdals, under Mirs Ahmad Khan and Ashraf. The last named are the most important, and the whole country is to some ex tent subordinate to the chiefs of Dashtiari (see Route IV (d) stage 3). The population of Bahu Kalat is about 1,200 ; there are 2 mud forts, several pukka houses, and 5 shops kept by Hindus. A kind of Sindhi is spoken as well as Baluchi. The climate is said to be fairly healthy; temperatures of 98° F. at noon and 89° F. at 6 p. m., are recorded in May, but ordi narily the heat in summer is great. Camping ground. —Unlimited. M' ater.

One track Jeads due N., over the Gwat Kash Tcutal, and via Bafatan village on the Sarbaz river, to Kaptigin Dok (15 miles from Kahnan Kash). The Gwat Kash Icutal, however, is difficult for laden camels, and impassable for wheeled artillery, but this short cut is a good deal used by local inhabitants. The other track, from mile 9£, turns due E., and passing through small easy hills and winding ndlds, reaches the summit of the Bagani Jcvtal (947 feet), at mile 12£. The ascent to this on the southern side, for 440 yards, has a gradient of- 1 - up a ndld 5 feet wide, with steep slopes on both sides. Gun wheels or cart wheels would, in places, ride 2 feet higher than the track, unless some pioneer work were undertaken. From the summit of the Bagani Icutal, the descent on the northern side is imperceptible, down a wide valley, to the Sarbaz river which is reached at mile 141.

From 4 miles 107*- below Rask to 5 miles north of Rask the hills on both sides shut in a narrow valley, and the hills themselves are only accessible for infantry with difficulty. From Rask, the track follows the bed of the Sarbaz river, over shingle and stones, and frequently crosses the running stream. The stream often runs in several branches, and the average depth of water is from one to two feet. At mile 2 there is a long “ S ” bend, and on the right bank, half way up the reach where it runs E. and W., the fort of Firu- zabad commands the river bed. Half a mile short of FIfuzabad, the track turns to the left, ascends a narrow shaly ndld, crosses a low hdal and descends again to the Sarbaz river at mile 6. The track now follows the river bed, passing the village of Shushgan on the right bank at mile 10. The valley is open56 Koute No. IV — contd. and cultivation and date palms fringe both banks. At mile 13 the track ascends the left bank and passing behind the cultivation surrounding the hamlet of JJaskurt, ascends 100 feet on to the stony plateau on which Parud village stands.

The track 119! follows the shingly river-bed, which is about 400 yards wide. The valley here is wide, with cultivation on both banks, which are level for some distance back. At mile 2 pass some conglomerate cliffs on the right bank, and at mile 2£ reach the extensive palm groves and gardens of Hait village, on the left bank. A track branches off eastwards to Hung, At mile 3 the hills close in on both sides, and the river-bed, 300 feet wide, is prac tically a defile as far as Daf Kaur. The hills on both banks are only about 300 feet above the river-bed and are steep and broken, but accessible for infantry pickets. Daf Kaur is a village of about 200 mud houses, situated on the right bank just below the junction of the Kxshi Kaur and Sarbaz river. The Kish! Kaur valley is open and fairly cultivated, and pro vides ample space for camping. This stage would be impas sable if the Sarbaz river were in flood. Water. —From river. Fuel. —Scarce.

Thence to mile 7 it is tortuous. The hamlet of Pirdan is situated in a recess on the left bank at mile 4. At mile 7 the gorge ends, and there is some alluvial ground on both banks ; the hills on both sides are now lower and accessible for infantry. The village of Band an is on the right bank at the upper end of the gorge. At mile 8 the large Jagan vala joins in on the right bank. From here to Sarbaz the river-bed winds considerably. The valley is enclosed by low easy hills. Palm groves and cultivation are continuous, and there are several small villages, two of which are Kumetag (mud fort) and Kan. Sarbaz fort is built of mud on a small rocky hill on the right bank, round which the river flows, and overlooking the Gwimak Kaur, which joins in from the east. The fort is commanded by higher hills about a mile distant. Many of the inhabitants can speak Urdu, as they go to Karachi to find employment. Bahram Khan and his brother AH Muham ma( l generally live at Sarbaz in the hot weather. TFctfer.—Good and abundant. FtteZ.—Scarce. Fodder .—Grass very scarce, camel grazing fair.

This spring, however,, is not much used by travellers, as it is off the main track, which proceeds up the river-bed until Ispatki is reached at 20 miles. There is no water at all in the river-bed between Pindak and Ispatki, except after the winter rains. Supplies nil, as there are no inhabitants.

The spring at Ab-i-Sawaran is on the right bank of the river up a narrow defile at a point just before the river-bed turns almost at a right angle. It would be very difficult to find without a guide. Should it be dry there is another spring J mile further on, on the N. side of the Kaur, called Ab-i-Duzdan. Neither of these springs is perennial, and there is said to be no perennial water until Sarkauran (see stage 16), a distance of 25 miles from Kahuri. Camping ground (1) at Ab-i-Sawaran, no information, (2) at Ab-i-Duzdan, unlimited.

From 10 miles to 13 miles the river bed is tortuous, but the general direction northerly ; the bed is 50 yards wide and fringed with tamarisks. Good going over shingle and gravel, and through running water (March 1912). The hills on both sides are broken but not more than 500' high and passable for infantry.

The Hasanoch Kaur is now about 30 yards wide and fringed with tamarisk bushes, and the going is good over gravel and shale. There are low hills on both sides. The general direction continues N.

From SARBAZ via the BUKUH KOTAL. Authority. —Hopkins, 1912. General remarks. —It is said that the Persians used to take wheeled artillery over this pass. The route follows alternative C to near the foot of the Mardukan Kotal, from which this pass lies 3 miles N., but there is no information regarding the road onward from the summit. It probably follows the line of a valley parallel to that of the Patki Kaur and rejoins the main route near the same point. Captain Hopkins reports that “ The Bukuh kutal is ap* proached by gradients of on each side and the track down the western side is easy, except for one small rise and fall of about 50' between two ndlds, which would require some pre paration for wheels. Elsewhere this route is quite practicable for wheeled artillery or even wheeled vehicles of any kind.” From native information, which according to Captain Hopkins is borne out by a comparison with the approach to the Mardukan Kotal, the last 3 miles (from whence alternative C is left) are easy for wheels, except for one place, which would coffer no serious difficulty.Koute No. V — contd. river, though, like those in the Sarhaz river, they are exposed to interruption by flood, are rather more open and probably become fit for traffic more quickly after a flood than the latter. In supplies the latter route has some advantages, in grazing the former. Kunarak, opposite Chahbar on the W. side of the bay, and the roads leading thence, are discussed in the epitome of Route VI which they chiefly concern. Tis, as a landing place, is also discussed there. It would be quite possible to land at Tis and make a way round the hills to Washnam (stage 1) but there would be little advantage, if any, in doing so. Chahbar is the best harbour on the coast of Persian Makran, but is exposed to the south and a strong swell runs during the monsoon. There are four fathoms 1 mile off the town, which is just inside the bay on the E. side. To land it is necessary to tranship into large country boats which can approach within 20 yards of the shore, and at favourable tides even closer. Animals must then swim ashore, and passengers and goods again tranship into smaller boats or be carried. The town is close to the beach, and has a population of fully 2,000, chiefly Maids and Buzdars. The proportion of negro blood is high. There are a number of shops kept by Hindu banias and Khojas, and considerable quantities of wheat, barley, rice and jowari (which are exported) can be obtained, Avith smaller quantities of cloth, sugar, kerosine oil, etc., Avhich are imported. In February 1917 a contractor offered to supply 100 maunds of &gt;ghi on the spot at Rs. 1-2-0 per seer, and from 200-300 maunds at a few days notice. Prices vary from month to month. The fish caught in the bay are good : large quantities of the coarser fish are dried for export both by sea and to the interior. There is a bungalow belonging to the Indo-European Tele graphs, with an Assistant Superintendent in charge : a good camping ground of considerable extent lies E. of it. There are numerous gardens, each rvith its well, from which abundant sweet water is obtained. Camel grazing is very good, but there is no grass, except for a short time after rain. There is how'- ever an unlimited supply of grass brought up from the main land and sold at 1^ to 2 maunds per rupee, of good quality, barshonk and gurkav. Fuel is also brought in ; there is plenty within 20 miles.68 Route No. V— contd. The first three stages (53J miles) are over the low-lying country bordering the coast. Two low ranges of hills are crossed, and in the passage over the second of these very slight improvement would be required to make it fit for wheeled! traffic. For the next three stages (50f miles) the track leads; over low and very easy hills mostly up and down the beds of tributaries of the Kaju River, which in this section takes a wide sweep round to the west. For the next six and a half stages (86 miles) the track leads up the bed of the Kaju river to its head. The gradients in this section are easy. The bed of the Kaju river is ordinarily shingle and not bad going as a rule, but there are a few places where stones are rather lar^e and make bad travelling, notably in the first 15 miles above Qasrqand. The Tank-i-Hunzuk (stage 11) is very difficult for a quarter of a mile, over rocks and through deep pools, and might delay a heavily laden caravan for an hour or two. There are one or two bad places in a narrow torrent bed, half a mile below Aspagah hutal, where there are rock steps across the ndla. rrn , , ... , bile IIUVU- The sand lulls south of Gwarpusht would be practically impass able for wheels. ^ r Europeans can seldom hire cameiX ifss size, age, and sex. an a rupee per diem-Route No. V — contd. l»ut some could be hired for about annas 12 a day, or Rs. 22 to Rs. 25 a, month, each, through native contractors. If large numbers were needed, the chiefs would have to be asked to help, and rates would go up. The best Makran camels carry a load of 5 maunds each, marching on an average 15 miles per diem, but the ordinary local camels carry only 3 to 4 maunds. The Baluchis prefer marching in the morning and afternoon, 'halting in the middle of the day to graze their animals. In the hot season all marching is done at night. The camels are only grazed and are given neither bhusa nor grain. A Iter native Stages. (A) The “river route ” to Qasrqand follows the Kaju river round to the west and avoids the hilly stages between Gaz and 'Qasrqand. This route is used in dry seasons. (B) This variation has no advantages. Note. —Between Qasrqand and Champ there is a great choice of halting places. There is little to choose among them, except that floods in the river frequently wash land away from one place and throw it up at another. It is therefore as well to take local advice in choosing camps. The following have been used in the past instead of those in the route.

At 10 miles the Zidrat of Tezkop, a large- white building, with a small group of huts and a well of excel lent water, lies 1,000 yards E. of the track. The country from here onwards is under the Dashuaj Sardars, that to the- W. being under Geh. At 11J miles the hills enclosing the Tezkop valley cease and the track now leads over an absolutely flat plain of hard pat, overgrown with scattered kilcar, small bushes, and occasional tufts of coarse grass. On the edge of this plain is Mil, a good well. The whole plain is known as^ Kambal, from a village some 10 miles N.-E. of Tezkop, where there is a large perennial pool of w ater; there are also many bands which hold w r ater for some time after rain. The plain is an excellent grazing ground for camels, but useless for horses. At Washnam there are some 20 mat huts and a little jowari and wheat cultivation.

(GAZ) The road runs over a 531 level plain of hard pat. At If miles there is a gentle ascent and descent over a low- spur. The track then continues over a plain, crossed by lines of low hills. At 5 miles is TurkanI, a hamlet of twenty mat huts, lying 20 yards to the east': good camping ground ; in No vember 1916 there was a large pool of rain water, evil smelling, on which people for 7 miles round had to depend for drinking water, camel grazing good. Alternative route A branches off from here. At 6^ miles, is Zuhrab, a hamlet of 12 mat huts and a mud mosque, surrounded by extensive cottcn and millet cultivation. At 9j miles is the hamlet of Kuch. consisting of ten mat huts and a little cultivation, 400 yards to the E ; the water of the village comes from holes. At 10| miles the track drops into a ndld bed in which there is a dense growth of kilcur and reeds, and a few date palms. At 11J miles is a large pool of very foul water, and 1,000 yards to the N. the shrine, hamlet, and cultivation of Pir Surab. At 13J miles the track leaves the ndld and continues over a level stony pl a m to 16| miles. There the track descends into the bed of the Kaju river by an easy descent of twenty yards passing a zidrat of two graves surrounded by a stone wall. The last mile of the stage lies through the dense jungle of tamarisk and kikur bordering the river-bed. • The march is passable for the three arms throughout, but slippery after rain.

General direction N. ,, The track leaves the 90 Rig bed by the right bank and runs over a level plain of hard gravel to 2 miles. It then drops into the river-bed again, the descent being steep and twenty yards in length. The track now leads up the bed of the stream, the valley gradually narrowing to the halting place. The ndld bed is thickly grown with tamarisk, hikur, and pish,and pools of clear sweet water are found every few hundred yards. The going is rough over large boulders and shingle, but the gradients are easy throughout. At the halting place there are no habitations.' This is apparently the same camping ground as that variously called RIgisahai and Ruhkushak, or quite close to it. Talarah proper is the pass a little further on. The short descent of twenty yards at 2 miles would require ramping for wheels, and the track, where it leads up the Rig stream, would have to be cleared of boulders.

Starting from camp 100 the track leaves'the Rig ndld for a short distance but soon rejoins it, and ascends gradually up its stony valley, three quarters of a mile wide, and commanded on both sides by hills from 2,500 to 3,000 high ; pools of water at intervals. The valley contracts rapidly to a narrow depth. At mile 1J reach a low kutal (1,872 feet), called Talarah which separates the Rig and Apal valleys. From the kutal, the track descends by easy gradients through a narrow passage between low mud hills, to mile 2J. At mile 3, about a mile E. by S- of the track, is the halting place^ of Kalai Zambu where there are two date groves and good spring74 Route No. \—contd. water. At mile 3|, the Apal valley opens out towards the E., and going is now very easy, over stony ground. At mile 6{, the Apal kawr is joined by a large tributary nala from the E., and the Apal Icaur makes an abrupt turn to the N.-W. through a precipitous gorge. The track crosses the nala and the right bank, which is 60 feet high and very steep, would have to be ramped for wheeled artillery. At mile 7, the track emerges from the hills and crosses the Parsuk river, which here is about 200 yards wide, with indeterminate banks. Continue across a stony plain to Qasrqand, which is reached at mile 10. Qasrqand is a collection of scattered villages, numbering perhaps 1,800 inhabitants in all, with a mud fort in fair repair, under which the chief village lies. The houses are chiefly of mud, or wattle, a few of stone. The population is mainly Paluch, but the proportion of negro blood, owing to the import ation of slaves from Muscat, is very high. This is not so notice able to visitors from the coast, where also there is much black blood, but immediately strikes travellers arriving from further north. There is an immense date-grove or group of groves, and a very large area of cultivation, chiefly rice and wheat, and there is more water available than land suitable for cultivation. The people ought to be prosperous, but are misgoverned. The rulers are Mir Jan Muhammad and Mir Muhammad Khan, a son of Mir Dost ijihammad, who died in December 1916, and a nephew of Q^r^ndTs^'l latt f iS intriguing to oust 1118 nephew.

There are two banias, brothers, from Hyderabad Sind, who keep small quantities of cloth, kerosine oil, sugar, etc., and a number of petty shop-keepers, but all are most rapacious. Many of the inhabitants have spent some years in Karachi as labourers ; some .artificers, carpenters and blacksmiths can be found, but they possess no materials. The fruits produced in the small garden among the groves are good and include mangoes, limes, citrons {Itiruuj), oranges, pomegranates, figs, crab-apples and grapes. 7 TUTURAN 2,200'.. 14 m. General direction N; -— From camp through 114 a thin belt of date palms into the river bed. From this point the whole march is over stones and the river is crossed and re-crossed repeatedly. In December 1916 the stream was seldom more than a foot deep. About 2| m. a gorge is entered, through which the river winds first to N. E. and then W. S. W. About 3-f, mile the 'Gwasha (Koshat) Kaur joins from the N. E. and route 34 to fSarbaz branches off up it. At 5 miles the date grove of Saman on the left bank ; at 6 mile Kalok on the right bank. The river then bends W. S. W. and at 7^ miles bends again to the N. The track over the Gwat Kash Pass (see note) here rejoins the main track. From here on most of the date groves belong to Champ. About 9 miles Gardak Cheri on the left bank, with a camping ground at a low level exposed to floods ; nearly 91 miles Gardak Sari, also on the left bank ; at fully 10 miles the Daidati Kaur joins on the right bank. A difficult track for donkeys runs up this kaur to Nokhoch, passing the Daidati grove on the way. At 10J miles the Daidati Daf groves on both sides of the river. Then comes Gafi on the right bank, where the river bends N.

Note. —The track over the Gwat Kash Pass cuts off about 3 miles but the ascent is very steep and at places even dangerous for laden animals. Only horses and lightly laden donkeys or mules, can cross it; of a considerable number of dismounted riding camels all but three had to turn back in December 1916. The worst part is just before reaching the summit (about 2,440') but the descent of 550' in a little over a mile is also difficult at one or two places. To approach, it cross the river directly after leaving camp at Qasrqand. 8 PUTAK 2,820 / .15 m. General direction N. The stones are 'bigger 129 and the going rougher on this march. The river, which again is constantly crossed and recrossed, is usually in a narrower channel and therefore deeper, but seldom over 18'. Here and there short cuts lead through the hills across bends in the river, but they are footpaths only. The date groves which are passed are prac tically all uninhabited, except for brief periods when the people come to sow their crops or to harvest the dates and grain. At other times they live in the hills with their flocks. On a whole march not a living soul may be seen. At 2J miles Kinder (left bank) ; 2£ miles Gusha Drangan (right bank).

Epitome .—The merits of this route, as compared with Routes IV via Sarbaz, and V via Qasrqand have been discussed in the epitome of the latter route ; the balance of evidence is in favour of Route V. This route is a well marked camel track throughout, with no serious difficulty except in the Sarha tangi, stage 9, which is fully described below. In their present condi tion stages 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10 are impassable for wheels, and sand in stages 12 and 13 would be an obstacle. The amount of work required in stages 1, 3 and 7 is not great, but stage 4 would occupy a Pioneer battalion for one day, stage 9 for 3 days, and stage 10 for one day. Stages 5, 6, and 8, -which lie in the beds of rivers would also be very tiring unless some of the stones were cleared away. Stages 4 to 9 would be impassable for transport of any kind after heavy rain, for periods varying from one day to a week. Chahbar itself has been described in the epitome to Route V. It remains to mention alternative landing places. Tis 4 miles N. of Chahbar on the E. side of the Bay may be dismissed briefly. The shore is partly rock bound and partly shoal, and landing there would be more difficult than at Chahbar, but it is practicable in fair weather and, by landing there, guns and cavalry would avoid the difficulties of stage 1. Kunarak, opposite Chahbar on the W. side of the Bay, is more important, since tracks leading from it to join the main route near stage 2 and at stage 3, respectively 10 and nearly 20 miles shorter than the main route, and avoid the hills in stage 1 and the ground exposed to inundation in stage 2. These advantages are however discounted by the greater difficulty of landing at Kunarak, by the inferior water supply and bv the lack of other supplies. The anchorage near Kunarak is partially sheltered from the monsoon, but the 4f fathom line is 3|- miles from the shore, and the larger local boats must be unloaded at some distance from the beach. The village consists of 80—100 mud huts, inhabitated mostly by Hot Baluch ; there is only one85 ■b hi p. ^ 181 iMissioi ith Koft scussd! lenceisi amel tnn wha taf, sent com 'heels, a« e amoii: it stage, or 3 dac lieintt the star issable fe Is varrt ) Route 1 lis 4 mile di^misse: :tly sk: .

Probably more wells could be dug, as at Gwadur, and Pasni. Camel grazing is 5 miles south on the headland, whence also fuel is brought, and grass is probably obtainable there. There are no detailed reports on tracks inland, but one runs through sandy and after wards banded country and meets the main route, one branch near Nur Muhammadi, another near Moman, and a third in the Pirgaruk Kaur. The other goes to Sargan (Route VII (a), stage 2) and thence over almost unknown country to Pishmant (stage 3 of the main route). It is probable that there might be some difficulty in crossing the hills S. of Pishmant. The gorge by which the Pishmant Kaur breaks through there is known to be impracticable, but the route as a whole is said to be easy. Camping grounds. —Large, generally unlimited, except at stage 8. Water. —Uncertain at stages 2 and 3; probably limited in quantity at stage 12 ; good elsewhere. Fuel. —Procurable throughout; tamarisk nearly everywhere, pish in the middle stages, besides brushwood. Fodder. —Dependent on the season: in ordinary years, camel grazing is good throughout, and grass procurable at most stages. Supplies. —In considerable quantities at Geh; in smaller quantities at Hichan, Pib and Ispaken. At Qasimabad and Bampur themselves there are no great quantities, but the whole resources of Bampur valley can be drawn on, if the population is friendly. Elsewhere little or nil, except just after the spring harvest, when 2,000 men might perhaps obtain supplies for a day in the valley of the Geh river. Alternative stages.—{a) Divides the journey from Chahbar to Geh into 7 stages, and cuts off a few miles of the river bed. This arrangement is good for heavy transport, but water is not as good as on the main route. (b) Follows the same short cut in 6 stages—only possible when there is water at Pir Mardak. (c) Between Sarha and Chah Gaz— preferable to the main route for a light camp, reducing the number of stages by one. (d) Between Ispakeh and Qasimabad—only feasible after rain.86 Route No. VI— contd. (c) From Ispakeh to Bampur via Mushkuh. This cuts off a miie, ajrd reduces the number of stages by one, but the stage to 'Faidabad is 30 miles, with only one pool of bad water on the VTV. (/) From Gishkuh to Bampur. This cuts off 5 miles and reduces the number of stages by one, or if combined with alter- n xtive C of two, but in that case would involve three successive long marches. The sand is said to be rather less heavy than on the main route. The camps in the low country between Chahbar and Pish Mant must depend on the watersupply, as also those between Pib and Bampur. In the Geh river and to a less extent in the Sarha river there are numerous suitable camping grounds and the length of the marches can be regulated at pleasure. No. of stagi and total distance, ‘ ?

Then through a stretch of sandy ground for about 2J miles, followed by a rough and rather Steep ascent to a big plateau at fully 3 miles. Cross this to 5 J miles to the edge of a line of cliffs overlooking the Tis valley and fully 300' above it. The descent is difficult for laden camels; always steep, it is sometimes a staircase over shelves of soft sandstone, and at one or two places narrow. A working party of 100 men could make the ascent from Chahbar passable for wheels in 2 hours, but the descent would take such a party, with explosives, 2 days. A few men with some gun cotton could rapidly improve it for camel transport. This stage could be avoided by landing near H-s fort instead of at Chahbar, but the landing would be more difficult. At TIs there are an old ruined fort, two gardens with mango and other fruit trees, and some banyan trees.

Turn N. on a strip of sand between the sea and the cliff. At miles the hills fall away to the right and the bay curves to the left. The track bends a little W. of N. and in clines away from the sea over sand and coarse grass. At 4;}- miles cross a large creek, edges slippery, only a few inches of water, b urther down this creek has a bottom of soft mud and no attempt should be made to cross it. On over similar sandy ground to miles where the sea is lost to view. At 9 miles cross the Parag creek, rather slippery mud, and come to the telegraph line, with huts of the linesmen and a few fishermen. See Route VII (a) stage 1. From Parag to camp, the track runs N.-W. through perfectly level ground, sandy and covered with small bushes and grass here and there. As camp is approached, the land is banded for cultivation. The exact site of the camp varies from year to year, according to the bands which hold water. There is a great area of good land here, but scarcely any population owing to the exactions of the rulers of Geh, and their servants and rivals, which have driven the inhabitants into exile. This plain is a continuation of that in which Washnam, Route V, stage 1, lies : the boundary between Geh and Dashtiari territory lies somewhere between the two places. Camping ground. —Unlimited.

Then W.-N.-W. up a Jcaur to 9 miles, cross a low ridge into the Pir Garuk Kaur, which here is wide and full of vegetation, but gradually contracts and becomes rougher and more stony. At 12| miles a narrow and rocky gorge, overhung by jagged cliffs, begins ; after a few hundred yards it widens and the ascent to the low Pir Garuk or Mai Parginar Pass (13 miles) is easy. Thence descend into the Jorani Kaur, and leaving it cross stretches of dan broken by ndlas, to the edge of the Pish Mant valley 16| miles, the descent into which (about 30') is by a steep and narrow track between mud banks.

At nearly, 1| miles the mouth of the Sarha or Mukht Kaur, a good flow of water (January 1917). Route V(c) goes up the Sarha Kaur. The stream, now somewhat diminished, but still knee deep in places is crossed four times before reaching the lower end of the Rais kalag on the left bank, with a small hamlet, at 5|- miles, after passing which the track from Puzhak via Pir Mardak rejoins the river track. Cross again to right bank, and keep up it past Bazigar grove on the left bank and descend into the river bed opposite the lower end of Tuladar grove, on the right bank. At 7 miles, on to the left bank again, and at 9 miles pass the Julai grove. At 12§ miles cross to right bank and at 13 miles pass the junction of the Gungh and Kishig Kaurs, which together make the Geh river. The Kishig Kaur from the N.-E. has only a small stream except for a short time after rain, but there is always, except in the driest season#rRoute No. YI— contd. 4 a good flow in the Giungh Kaur. The Geh groves begin in the angle between the streams. Keep up the Gungh Kaur. The Geh fort appears on the left bank, a large building, but only the northern part is now in repair. From the riverside it is imposing, but to the E. and N.-E. the ground rises from it and dwarfs it. In dry weather the banks of the river are climbed a short distance above the fork and the track passes through the groves, leaving the fort on the left, to camp near the Jalalabad ridge about 1,000 yards N. of the fort. In wet weather, or when there is much irrigation, the path through the groves is too slip ery for camels and it is neoetsary to continue up the Gungh Kaur past the fort to the place where the Bint track crosses the stream [Route VII (d)] and then turn back to camp. This adds a full mile to the distance. Geh is a collection of small villages, all mean and squalid, together numbering perhaps 500 houses. It used to be the capital of Southern Persian Baluchistan. Sardar Said Khan, Narui, the last Deputy Governor, became an independent ruler, but died in 1916. His son Husain Khan, a boy of about 13, still (February 1918) maintains his position against greedy relatives and rivals, but the prosperity of the town has gone.

General direction (2,200') N.-N.-W. An easy ^0- march, though one or 2 places near the watershed are rather narrow and the fre quent crossings of the Gungh Kaur are trying after rain. Start N.-W. from camp, leaving the small village of Tumpi on the92 Route No. VI— contd. right. Enter the Gungh Kaur and cross it just where the small stream that bounds the Geh plain on the N. joins it from the E. Going stony to 1| miles where the Gungh Kaur is recrossed. Ascend left bank to a maidan with much grazing, then over rough ground broken by ndlds, across a sandy basin, over a neck and down a narrow kaur to Yatan, a ‘ bent ’ on the banks of the Gungh Kaur ; a little cultivation and much tamarisk; 5 miles. Descend into the kaur, which is crossed perhaps 25 times in the next 4| miles ; some of the crossings are nasty in a strong current, over big stones. The valley narrows and there are cliffs alternately on either side. At 9J miles Zard Piran {plr is the local name for the kabar tree), whence the valley opens out, and the Gungh Kaur is left by its right bank. Cross a large tributary coming from S.-W., then over stony ground into another tributary from X., at about 10J miles. Up it to 11 miles, then by a narrow track from its right bank, ascend to the small Jamok kalag, 12 miles. Continue to ascend by a rough and narrow track among smaller hills to 14 miles the watershed. Turn W.-N.-W. and cross the Jak Kaur coming from the Shigim hills to the N.-E. Here the track is overhung by steep hills on the W. When they end, turn W. to camp, or dan E. of main groves. The direct track up the Sirha river joins in here (see stage 5) and Route VII(/i) to Fanuch branches off. Hichan is a good village of perhaps 100 huts and a fort, under Mir Madad Khan, Shiranzai Narui, a half-brother of the late Sardar Said Khan. There are large date-groves and a considerable area of cultivation.

At 2f miles leave the Shugshag Kaur by its right bank and turn N. Enter a narrow kaur and ascend to a small kutal at 4^ miles. Thence over level ground to the banks of the Sirha river, a steep descent into its bed at miles. A bridle path branches off a little way back and enters the river at miles, but by a descent too steep for laden camels. Up the stony river bed, crossing and re crossing the stream to 7J miles, the mouth of the Kaur-i-Ziar Nadan, up which a difficult footpath leads N.-E. to Pib. Just above this the long straggling kalag of Takht-i-Malik on the right bank. Some cultivation and a good site for a large camp, with water, fuel, and grazing at hand. The valley now contracts and the walls enclosing it become Steeper. At 9 miles a big kaur comes in from the N.-W. ; at 11 miles the small grove of Gwaran on the left bank. Then comes Gazmir just below the mouth of the gorge, a little island in the bed of the stream, raised 6' only, and covered with tamarisks. A track to Bint and Fanuch [see Route VII(/)] branches off here. This is the beginning of the Lashar country, under Mir Muhim Khan of Pib, an old man whose son Mir Hoti is the real leader, ambitious, bold, and treacherous, but a good companion.

VI — contd. direction ; on the ascent it would be necessary to halve the loads. Much labour and blasting would be required to make a road for wheeled artillery. It would take a Pioneer battalion 3 days, and much of the work would have to be done afresh after'each flood. Diversions from camp along the right bank to above Hamban and from Sohran up the left bank for 3 miles might be permanent. Above that point the hills are so steep and rough that it would be difficult to find a high track. The country on either side is so mountainous that there appears to be no road by which the pass can be turned nearer than Champ on one side or Fanuch on the other. The Lashars take pride in the inaccessibility of their country, and, even if they had no objection to the passage of a force, would be very unwilling to see it violated by the construction of a road. Directly above camp the valley contracts and for the rest of the tangi it is seldom mote than 10 to 20 yards broad. At 1 mile Hamban, under the Hamban Kuh on the W., a slope of bare smooth rock with water flowing over it. This can be avoided by the detour from camp along the right bank mentioned above. At miles the valley widens for a short distance ; its bed is nearly all bare rock with channels cut through it; a large pool on the W. side. The tract for a few miles above this is called Sohran. A small cluster of date-palms on the left bank with 1 hut is c&amp;lled Jaukhanu. On the right bank is another small clump of date-palms called Jam. Opposite it, the camel track leaves the river bed and ascends the left bank, climbing 500' in little more than a mile—one short bad bit over sKppery and crumbling rock winds along the face of the hills for 2 miles, and descends sharply into the valley again, reaching it at miles. For this distance the river is impassable for animals. An active man can get through by scrambling and wading when the water is low. At 7 miles is Mogal Band, where the stream passes through a cleft in a wall of rock ; just above this is a sangar which the Lashars held successfully some years ago against the Persian Governor- General. At 8 miles Putap, a few date trees at the mouth of the kaur of the same name, coming from the N.-E. ; at 8J miles Duzdandar Kaur joins from N.-W. Up it a track passable for horses but not for camels, runs to Kuchink [ see Route VII (/)J. At 9J miles Band-i-Muridan, on left bank, some abandoned cultivation.

K)| miles it opens on to the Sarha basin, an amphitheatre sur rounded by a great circle of hills, of which Azabag to N.-E. is said to be full of bears and panthers. In the valley are large date-groves, some cultivation, a few huts, and excellent grazing. The camping ground is above the groves. From a small eleva tion near it {3,979') a magnificent view is obtained of the Lashar hills on all sides. A difficult camel track goes to Fanuch, and -a footpath to Bint, probably ma Kuchink.

There is little or no water in the Sarha Kaur above the date-grove . The pass (4,100') is at 31 miles, with a small spring just below it. To the N. of it the going is good, gradually descending ; at 6J miles the pretty date-grove of Hugin, with numerous springs, culti vation, and some 150 inhabitants. The road follows down the stream for some distance and then up a dry ndld, and crossing ome barren down country emerges on a broad plain bounded on the E by the Lashar mountains. Pib, the residence of Mir Muhim Khan, the Lashar Chief, lies 2 miles off the main track to the E. beside a large date-grove.

Galindo, 1888 ; Napier, 1899; Grey, 1905; Commercial Mis sion, 1905 ; Shakespear, 1906 ; Gibbon and Sher Jang, 1907 ; Rich, 1916. Epitome—Tih.is is the main route from Bandar Abbas to Narmashir, Sistan, and Afghanistan. Although at present im practicable for wheeled traffic this route presents an easy alignment for a cart-road or railway from the southern coas to the Persian plateau. , rm,„ The road.—The first 66 miles are over level ground, itie next 62 miles are up the course of the Minab river and i s tributaries, crossing several small plains. The route then lies over the Ginau pass for 13 miles. The next 63| miles are over a level plain. The road then approaches the Jabal Ban range, leading over rough ground for 30| miles. The ne 13 miles are over the Jabal Bariz range by the Gishu pas . This, the first 16 miles out of Minab, and the Guzar-i-Gma are the only parts that present any obstacle to the construc tion of a road or railway. The route then lies over practica } level ground for 42| miles to Rigan.114 Route No. YIII— contd. Climate .—From December to March snow is to be found on the higher parts of the road, and on the Gishu pass over the Jabal Bariz range. During the summer months and up to November the heat on the lower parts of the road would be found to be extremely trying for troops on the march. For information concerning the rainfall vide Route No. XI. Heavier rain, however, may be expected near Minab owing to the extent of gardens and vegetation. Physical obstacles. —(a) Stage 1.—The whole of this stage is liable to become a regular swamp in times of rain. There are also a few water-courses which have to be crossed, and which are liable to sudden floods, when difficulty would probably be found in crossing them. (6) Stage 2.—The crossing of the Baghu river in wet w'ea- t ier ft attended with much danger, and it is sometimes ab solutely impassable. Floods in the river rise with very little warning, but subside as quickly afterwards.. (c) Stage 5.—.The Minab river, which is some 1,200 yards wide, is sometimes impassable, or difficult to cross, at times of flood. {d) Stage 9.—The Kutal-i-Ginau is impassable for wheels in its present state, but some blasting and a little pick and shovel work would make it passable for guns (probably a week’s work tor a battalion of Pioneers). (e) Stage 16.—The Gishu pass would offer difficulties to The passage of wheeled artillery, but, at the same time, guns -could be unhorsed and dragged over by hand. Gibbon thinks this impossible in the present condition of the road. Ihis pass was pronounced easy by railway surveyors, 1913. vide stage 16. \\ ith reference to the statement made by the Commercial Mission that the pass can be avoided by taking the way direct from Mil-i-Farhad to Darumpi, halting at a camping-place in the Rudkhaneh Karund, and going over the easier Sabzu pass, which is a few miles to the south and west of the Gishu pass, (^rey says that Darumpi is not on the same side of the Jabal Bariz range as Mll-i-Farhad, and that the existence of the babzu pass, concerning which nothing could be ascertained locally, appears to be doubtful. Gibbon was informed that there were several other passes but that the main route wasI Route No. Wll—^ontd. best and shortest. It is almost impossible to find out any thing as this part of the country appears to be deserted. Transport .—In ordinary times the transport used on this route consists of camels and donkeys. Camels are obtainab'e from Bashakard, and donkeys from almost any village around Bandar Abbas or along the route. Camels are of light build' and seldom capable of carrying more than 4 maunds (Indian) ;■ where large numbers are concerned it would be unsafe to cal culate for more than 3| maunds per camel. For more detailed information on the subject vide Route No. XI. The task of collecting donkeys would be very slow, and prices would go up at once. Water. —On‘the southern routes the water is more or less brackish, and is said to be the same on the main route to a less extent. Up to Mlnab (stage 5) good water obtainable at short dis tances, usually from wells, the depth of which never exceeds 25 feet. On the remainder of the route the water is principally obtained from streams. At stages 2, 4, and 8 water is good and abundant from wells ^ At stages 11 and 12 is more or less foul from w-ells. At stage 1 water is brackish from wells. At stages 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, and 17 water is good' and abundant from streams. At stages 15, 16, and 17 water is obtained from pools in the river-bed, which are often foul. At stages 13 and 17 water is good and abundant from qandts. fuel. In some of the lower stages the inhabitants use dry date leaves, but, taken on the whole, there is an abund ance of bushes that serve for fuel. Fodder. There is abundant, and good, grazing for camels and donkeys throughout the route according to the greater number of the authorities, but Sykes states that in February he found grazing extremely scarce. Supplies .—Practically speaking all supplies would have to^ be carried none being obtainable until the fertile district of Narmashir is reached, where large quantities could be collected. There are some 150 cattle at Hajiabad, 1,000 cattle at a low estimate at Manujan, and 50 at Kacn-i-’Ali. Every village has a flock or 2 of goats and sheep, but in the case of an.116 Route No. VIII— contd . advance of troops these would be driven off into the hills or ^Alternative routes.~(a) From Nakhl Nakhuda (stage 1, 4 miles) to Minab (stage 5).-This is the shortest route from Bandar Abbas to Minab, but it is not passable in time of wet weather • it is however, that most used by caravans, the traffic over this and’the next route (b) to Deh-Nu being about equal. Supplies and water are scanty and grazing obtainable for camels ° nl Jb) From Nakhl Nakhuda (stage 1, 4 miles) to Deh-Nu (stage 2 5b miles).—There is no detailed description of this route but it appears to be like the preceding alternative stao-e’ in that it would not be practicable in wet weather. It also has the advantage of being shorter than the main route given A detailed description would, however, be almost exactly the same as that contained under stages 1 and 2 Bacrhu and Jallabi, as the same streams, etc., have to be crossed, and that only 2 or 3 miles south of the route actually described. . . x . (c) The Commercial Mission reports that there is a caravan track between Shamil and Minab which is used sometimes by Bandar Abbas-Sistan caravans when the southern routes are rendered*impracticable by floods. For stages to Shamil Route vide Route IX. (d) There is a note in the report of the Commercial Mission to Persia that the Gishu pass (stage 16) can be avoided by going from Mil-i-Farhad (stage 15) direct to Darumpi, a camp ing-place in the Rudkhaneh-i-Karund, and going over the easier Sabzu pass, which is a few miles to the south and west of the Gishu pass ; there is no further information concerning this alternative stage; vide also Grey’s opinion under physical obstacles.

Starting from the pier eastwards along the front of the town the track crosses a sandy river-bed which forms the eastern boundary of the town. This is 100 yards wide and contains water only after heavy rain, when it runs foot deep. The road gradually slopes away from the sea passing over a plain com posed of very deep sand in front of the new British Consulate and several other mud houses and palm-huts, until, at 2| miles, it crosses another sandy river-bed 40 yards wide. This is said to run 4 or 5 feet deep for a few hours after heavy rains. As far as Naiband the beach at low water forms a much, better road than the track. On the E. bank of this river lies a small palm-grove which extends a little south of the Consulate. The village consists of a large bungalow, which is used to house the British Consulate, the quarantine bungalow, 4 other mud houses, 4 groups of palm-leaf huts, and a number of wells containing water, along the river-bed. Some of the wells contain good water and some bad, but even the best have a brackish taste. There are some vegetable gardens irrigated from the wells, and in the rainy season a little land is cultivated. Supplies of all sorts are available in small quan tities ; larger amounts could be obtained from Bandar Abbas. At miles another river-bed, 40 yards wide, which contains water only after heavy rain. At 4| miles the village of Nakhl Nakhuda, population about 200, is seen to the south of the road, situated in a date-grove which extends to the seashore.

Till 3f miles the going is over rough boulders and would be very bad for all kinds of transport and difficult for guns—in wet weather impassable owing to the water in the river. To make this part fit for the passage of guns large gangs of men would be needed to remove the boulders from the road ; Jennings states, however, that the Persians have take wheeled artillery over this road. At 3| miles the road leav the river-bed and passes over a spur, the highest pointRoute No. VIII — contd. -which is reached at 4| miles. At 4f miles the road again meets the river-bed. .Fhe road for this mile over the spur is verv narrow and rough; it would take a Pioneer battalion 2 or 3 days to make it practicable for guns, and even then the descent into the river-bed on the N. side would be very steep. At 5 miles, Bagh-i-Sisi, a small date-grove, with no huts nor supplies. At 6^ miles the left bank of the river is ascended. Just before reaching Mir ’AH Dad, a small grove of date trees, with three palm-leaf huts, at 8 miles, there is a steep descent of 30 feet into the river-bed, which would require a few hours’ work to make it fit for guns. At llj miles the river is crossed and the track continues over a narrow path on the right bank. At 15 miles the river is again crossed and the left bank is followed round the end of a spur. The Guzar-i-Pichal, mentioned by Napier, is only a foot-path lead ing over this spur. At 151 miles the river is again crossed and the track lies over the flat end of another spur. Between 13 and 16 miles the going is very rough in places and the path very narrow, the foot of the hills coming right down to the water’s edge. At 16 miles the road runs up the river-bed through water for 200 yards. The greater volume of water appears to come down the Rudan branch. The Birinti branch is about 30 feet wide and a little over a foot deep. Palm trees lie mostly along the northern bank in a long straggling line. Another low flat spur is then crossed and at 17 miles the Rudan road branches off to the left, following the course of the Rudkhaneh-i-Rudan which joins the Minab river at this point. Here the river is again crossed and the road continues in the bed of the river to the end of the stage. Birinti is a village of 50 palm-leaf huts situated in a date-grove ; there is a little cultivation on both sides of the river.

Between U miles and 4 miles the going is good over level gravelly ground, extending some 2 miles to the S to the hills; several ndlds, however, have to be crossed, which would delay guns. At 4 miles the road again descends into the river-bed along which it runs to 7 miles. At / miles it ascends the left bank, which it follows to about miles where it crosses the river and runs over a low pass on to the Jacdun plain. Part cf the asctnt is difficult going. On the right of the road there is much cultivation, chiefly of barley and millet, which continues on the bank of an irrigation channel opposite to the fort. Jaghin is a village of about 50 palm-leaf huts and a mud fort in good repair. The village and fort are situated on the south side of the river (on the opposite side to the road). Stage is passable by wheels, with diversion here and there. Water.—From the river. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder. —Camel-grazing plentiful. Bhusa is obtainable.

The irrigation is by a cut from the river. At 13J miles . the hills which have formed the eastern and western boundaries of the plain close in on the river and the road drops into the river at this point; this descent into the river would require a little improvement to make it fit for wheels. At 14£ miles the road bifurcates, one branch crossing to the left bank of the river and passing over a spur by a pass known as the Gudar-i- Kandar Tu before debouching on the Manujan plain. The other branch, which is the shorter and better route, continues along the right bank of the river and follows it up until the first cultivation and date-groves of Manujan are reached. The stage is passable for motors, except fer 500 yards at the Gudar-i- KandarTu. Going steny but easy. Manujan is a fairly large123 5 Route No. VIII— con^. scattered village. The fort is in ruins. The halting-place used by the caravans is 3f miles from the fort. Manujan is said to possess SO horses, 30 buffaloes, 2,000—3,000 cattle; and 4,000 —5,000 sheep and goats.

General direction E. ~ The track crosses s 144 2 tributary of the Mittab river, 100 yards wide, with shingly bottom and banks. Then good going over hard gravel to 9f miles, crossing three small stony torrent-beds at miles 1, 6J, and 8|. At 9J miles the road drops into a shingly river-bed in which it passges between the ends of 2 spurs. At 10 miles there is a halting- place and a well, 800 yards to the south in theriver-bed, called Safid Kumbil. Thence good going until the road enters another river-bed, at 13J miles, at a point known as Kahur-i- Daraz, where there is a spring of good water which is liable to dry up. The road now gradually ascends the Baz Gar leutal and descends again into a halting-place called Kan-i- Shah at 16f miles. The gradients of the road are easy and could be made passable for wheels in a few hours. Kan-i- Shah is a camping-ground with a few pools of water in the river-bed, but no huts or supplies. At 18 miles the ascent of the Ginau kutal begins and at 19J miles the summit is reached, at an elevation of 1,645 feet. The road now gradually de scends to Ginau. The road over the pass is impassable for wheels in its present condition ; it would take a Pioneer batta lion at least a week to make it fit for guns. At about 25 J miles the road runs down a long steep descent into a broad dry water-course ; this would require 2 days’ work by a Pioneer battalion to make it fit for wheels. Ginau is simply a camping- ground, with no inhabitants. Water .—From a very small stream of running water. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder. —Camel-grazing plentiful, grass scarce.124 Route No. VIII — contd.

At 11| miles the cultivation of Kan-i-’AH commences, and the ruins of Kaleh-i-Qandaq lie 1 mile to the right. There are a few scattered huts, and a good many w r ells on from here to the end of the stage. At 13f miles there is a slight rise and then an easy descent to Kan- i-’Ali. Kan-i-’Ali consists of about 150 huts, with 500 inhabitants. The whole of this march is passable by the 3 arms. Two thousand sheep and goats and 200 cattle. Ac cording to Gibbon J of these numbers would be nearer the mark. See Route No. VII, stage 15. 11 CHAH-I-RiGMATl, 19£ m. General direction E.-N.-E.

The road now leads through a dense jungle of acacia, tamarisk, and her trees. At 6f miles, Ziarat Zargardi, a dilapidated mud shrine surrounded by a large graveyard, near which is a well of good water situated on the bank of a small dry stream, 20 feet wide. At 8 miles this stream is crossed. At 12f miles the road drops into a river-bed, 400 feet wide, which it follows for | mile. From here on to the end of the stage the road is over shingle, and, in places, loose sand, run ning beside a line of trees on the banks of a small irrigation cut. At 16| miles a stream-bed is crossed, 100 feet wide. At 17f miles,- Deh-i-Gau, a grove of date-palms, with a small Bal'uch camp, 900 yards to the right of the road.

At 10 miles, Panj Angusht, 1 mile to the right of the road ; a grove of date-palms, with a spring of good water. No huts or supplies. The road now leads over rolling ground crossing many ndlds. At 13J miles Darig-i-Tul, a pool of water liable to dry up, in a ndld-heA at the base of the Mil-i-Farhad. The road now runs round the south-east of the Mil-i-Farhad ; it is very rough, with 2 very steep descents of about 50 to 100 yards each. These would have to be improved to admit of the passage of guns, which would probably have to be man-handled down. It. crosses the Rudkhaneh-i-Paimish diagonally at IGJ miles.

Thence it leads up a small stream to the summit of the Gishu pass which is reached at miles, at an elevation or 3,160 feet. From 2f to miles the road winds in and out in a narrow rocky ravine or water-course with almost perpendicular sides of rock in places. In some spots blasting would be required to admit of the passage of guns. The last a-cent of some 500 yards is very steep ; guns would have to be hauled up this by means of blocks and tackle, direct haul age being insufficient. The descent on the other side, mostly along the bed of another stream, is very steep for about f mile. The going is then easier than on the S. side, but it is very stony. It would take a battalion of Pioneers a month to make this pass practicable for guns ; a great deal of blasting would be necessary. In case of a sudden storm this pass would be most dangeroiis to anyone caught inside it. There is a small pool of water at the stage and a heap of stones mark ing the spot where Hazrat’Abbas’All, one of the 12 Imams, is said to have halted. Note. —(According to Yol. Ill—1913 of the Karachi Extension Railway Survey the Glihu pass is easy.) Water. —The water-supply from the stream-beds running down on either side of the pass is unreliable ; water should, therefore, be carried from some small springs in the water course immediately below the pass.

The going is mostly 268J fair down the shingly bed of the Gishu river ; the boulders would have to be removed to make the road fit for guns. At 8 miles the river is crossed, and the track passes over a spur, which is very steep ; the road would have to be zig-zagged considerably to make it fit for guns. The descent on the far side is very rough and trying to the feet of animals. At 12 miles the road descends into the bed of the DarumpI river which is followed to 16£ miles. The road now crosses another low ridge to the N. of the valley ,128 Koute No. VIII— contd. and at 17J miles descends into the valley of the Kunarnaf river.

There is no 27 detailed description of this route, but as far as Kalugan the route would be quite practicable for traffic of any kind were it not for several very muddy and swampy streams which have to be crossed. There would be, no doubt, some difficulty in dragging guns or wagons across some of these as their- bottoms and banks are com posed of soft yielding mud. Kalugan is a miserable little group of huts in a small palm-grove. Several other palm- groves are dotted about to the S.Route No VIII— conoid.

The road is 51f almost exactly like that in the past stage, level and good, with the exception of 2 salt river crossings at about 13 miles. Some 400 yards beyond the second of these are some brackish wells along the banks of this river. Near Hajiabad the country becomes more sandy, and the flourishing village itself, with its extens ive date-groves, stands in the middle of a large tract of loose drifting sand. It is a more flourishing place than Kalugan, though it only consists of palm-leaf huts. Water .—Good water-supply from canals. Fodder.—Good camel-grazing. Supplies .—Supplies are procurable in small quantities. 3 MINAB .. 11 m. General direction E. The palm-groves and 62f cultivation extend almost without a break the whole way to Minab. The country Is perfectly level, the only obstacles to traffic of any kind con sisting of some narrow irrigation channels whic h intersect tthe road at a few points ; the bridges over these are suitable dor pack transport.

Sykes, 1903 ; Commercial Mission, 1905 ; Shakespear, Stewart, 1906; Dodson, 1913 ; Fowle, 1914 ; Murphy, 1916 ; Rich, 1916.130 Route No. IX— contd. Epitome .—This is a main winter route, and largely used by caravans, but it would not be passable for wheeled traffic.. Rich, 1916, reports that 3 or 4 years ago 2 carriages for the Governor of Kirman were taken by this route. In very dry weather difficulty would probably be experienced in connection with water-supply. The first 4 stages would be passable- for wheeled traffic, but there is not sufficient information to admit of any statement being made under this head concerning the latter stages of the route. It may, however, be taken that,, without a great amount of labour, it would not be passable for guns. Some of the rivers and water-courses that have to- be crossed in the earlier stages are liable to sudden floods, under which circumstances they are either dangerous or absolutely impassable. The flooding of the rivers cannot be foreseen, owing to the great distance separating cause and effect. Climate .—From December to the end of March the higher parts of the road are covered with deep snow and severe coldi is experienced. From April to September the first 5 stages are excessively hot and unhealthy, and troops marching up at that time of the year would suffer much, but directly the high plateau was reached at stage 14, Saqdir, they would march by day in at least moderate comfort, the average shade temperature during the hottest periods not exceeding 95° F. There is very little information concerning the rainfall of the country traversed by the route, but rain appears to fall more or less from the end of November to the beginning of April, being heavier in December and January. Physical obstacles. — (a) Between Khushku and Shamil, (stage 4) the road lies over very low ground and several water courses have to be crossed, which at ordinary times appear to- give a certain amount of trouble, and in wet weather would; probably be absolutely impassable. The whole of the low-lying country after leaving Bandar ’Abbas is a swamp during the winter. (a) (i) In stage 5 the defile commencing 10 miles on the Bandar ’Abbas side of Pariah—up to Rahdar—known as the- Dhami Tangx, is the most difficult portion of the whole route (Stewart). (b) In stage 6 the Guzar-i-Shuran has to be crossed, which is a very steep and difficult pass between the Shamil and Duzdx rivers.Route No. IX — contd. (c) Between Sabzavaran and Saqdir (stage 14) there are a ■couple of watersheds to be crossed which are rather difficult for transport. (d) In stage 15 the Deh Bakri pass, over the Jamal Bariz, is liable to be covered with snow in the winter months. Water .—Is to be obtained at all the halting-places. Fuel.-—Is usually to be found in the form of thorn-bushes. Fodder .—Grazing for all animals can be obtained at almost all stages from February to June and for camels during nearly ■every month of the year. Supplies .—The figures for supplies are based on information given by the Agent to the Treasurer-General in Kirman, and, therefore, probably give .some indication of the truth, though •they cannot be taken as being in any way absolutely correct. Unless otherwise stated the amount of supplies is what might be collected within a radius of about 4 miles of the various halting-places at 4 days’ notice. The supplies of wheat and barley depend naturally on the time of the year at which they are required. From Bandar Abbas to Murghak (stage 15) the harvest is generally gathered in by the end of May, but from Murghak not until about 5 weeks later. The largest supplies would, of course, be available at these seasons of the year. It may be remarked that all supplies especially those of live-stock, between Gulashgird [stage 8 alternative (6)] and Sarvistan (stage 16), are at present (1914) very scarce owing do a large Baluch raid which swept over this part in February, 1914, and that this scarcity will continue for some years to come. The estimate of supplies for this part of the route are what it might be expected to produce in normal years. .Supplies of wheat and barley given in Indian maunds.

The latter portion lies through culti vate d ground. The name of Shamil is given to a number of villages (50 to 100 houses each) lying within a radius of about 4 miles, which is mostly covered with palm-groves. The dis trict of Shamil is fairly rich as districts go in Persia, and would form a good advance depdt for the collection of supplies for troops moving north from Bandar Abbas.

The day’s march 73 is very fatiguing. After crossing a river of sweet water which flows through the village the road follows the bed of a water-course, and to 4 miles winds in and out, when it leads across a stony plain about 2 miles wide, lying at the foot of a range of barren hills. This plain is a great camping-ground for the llidts and appears to be a network of water-courses that carry off the water from the hills beyond. The pathway, which is in some places very narrow and only just wide enough for a mounted man, enters the hills by an opening which is known as the Nauargu pass, 1,734 feet high and is the bed of a water-course, filled with aRoute No. IK—contd. considerable amount of pure fresh water, with many deep pools. This track up the narrow boulder-strewn bed of the stream is very difficult for any kind of laden animals: in the W. part of it mules took 5 hours to do 6 miles. Up to 7 miles the track runs along this rocky bed till it ascends to a higher plateau from which a glimpse of the Sikh-i-Jandan can be caught to the N.-W. The constant ascents and descents, added to the stony nature of the path, make this a very trying march for horses. For Pariah .see Route No. X, stage 8. 6 RUDKHANEH-I- 23 m. General direction E.-N.

The road runs 96 over a stony plain to 2| m. when it enters the bed of a dry water-course along which it proceeds practically to the top of the Guzar-i-Shuran, (2,625’) The road about here for about 2 miles is simply a mass of boulders, but could be made, by blasting and clearing, a fairly good caravan track. From this place to the halting- ground at Rud khaneh-i-Duzdl the route lies over an undulating plain, intersected by many streams clothed with the usual low brushwood. At 10 miles a small hauz for the storage of rain water is passed. About 11 miles reach Rahdar, where there is a date-plantation, with good water from qandt. At 13 m. the Rudkhana-i-Gishkan is crossed. At 23 miles the camping- ground is reached on the N. side of the Duzdl river.

At miles, Mihrjan, an old ruined fort, is passed about J mile to the right of the road. The track now rises lightly on to a low plater u, from whence the zlarat of ’Abbas ’Ali is visible on a small greyish- white hill, about a mile to the left front. The hills in that direction fall back somewhat, and a water-course issues from them, comes past the zidrat, and sweeps away to the right rear. At 4A miles the track runs through the village of Hasanabad, a small village of some dozen huts, with a little corn land round it. All these villages passed appear to have a good supply of water. At 5J miles the route lies over a bare sandy plain, but with thick jungle close on the right. At 8| miles Karmiabad is passed with a few huts and a date-grove. A mass of low gravel hills are passed on the right of the road at 8| miles. At 10 miles, after skirting the slopes of these hills, a broad water course is crossed which comes in from the left, and cuts the mass of hills into two unequal portions. Half a mile down the water course to the right and on its southern bank is a small zidrat. At about 11 miles the track curves round the northern face of these hills. Just beyond to the north is a swampy water-course, sweeping round to the S.-E. A large irrigation channel is taken off from it, and runs close to the foot of the hills. The track goes round to the further side, in fact, until it is just under the zidrat just noted. Here there is a group of a dozen huts on the plain at the foot of the hill forming the village of Bagh-i-Babu. Grazing excellent along the route. Water .—Good for small camps.

E. of Bagh-i-Babu there is a water-course which make$ the ground very swampy in that direction. The track strikes off to the E. for miles before it gets into dry ground and a beaten track. It then turns northwards and passes on the left the village of Khatun- abad, about f mile to the N. of the hill. There is a good deal of cultivation round it, and some tamarisk jungle. The direction is now towards the right-hand side of another small hill visible ahead, which is reached at 4 miles 4 broad water-course with a small stream in it flows past the S. side, running from the hills on the left towards the centre of the va ley to the right.

Thence the track lies up the left bank for | mile, when it leaves the river-side and goes up the stony foot-hills of the range to the right. The direction is now northerly, with a slight ascent, over extremely rough ground much intersected by rocky nalds, and altogether disagreeable travelling. At 7 miles the ascent begins to grow somewhat steeper, and the hills on the right are only about J mile oif. They are rocky, with very steep slopes. The track leads tolerably straight towards the mouth of the gap by which the hills are entered ; it lies behind a small spur of reddish coloured rock, which runs down towards the plain, ending in 3 or 4 small rounded knolls. The road goes between 2 of these knolls, and reaches the mouth of the pass at 11 miles. Just before reaching it there is a burial-ground on the left, with some wild almond bushes. The track turns sharp to the right, up'the broad stony bed of a dry w'ater-course. This is not the actual head of the valley, which extends for some distance further to the N. before the point is reached where the Rudkhaneh-i-Shur issues from the hills and separates into its multitudinous channels; its water is sweet. Tins ravine is about 100 yards wide, and runs between red sandstone strata. The bottom is of coarse gravel, with a gentle slope. The direction of the track is first N.-N.-E. as far as § mile from the mouth, where there is a small spring in the skirt of the left-hand bank, called Chashmeh Duzdan, 14 miles, and here the direction changes a little more easterly. The Murghak is, or should be, the name given to the entire pass from its commencement between Chashmeh Duzdan and Saqdir, and its debouchment at, or near, Murghak on the N. side. In winter the pass may be blocked by snow, but in the end of Decem ber 1905 only a mile on the S. side was bad going.— {Stewart). A path about 4 or 5 miles shorter leads straight across the rough and stony desert plain to Chashmeh-i-Duzdan. In winter, however, the Rud-i-Shur is often impassable at the crossing by this route and caravans generally^ go via Dasht-i- Kuch in winter. At about 15 miles pass Ab-i-Garmu; the water is up a gully to the left. The track from here runs up the bed of the ravine, which gets rougher and rockier as it proceeds, also growing steeper and curving to the right; there138 Route No. IX — contd. is an increasing amount of scattered jungle, no longer tamarisk as on the Jiruft plain, but hill bush, e.g., archan. At 17 miles the ascent of the Gudar-i-Murghak commences, a steep, winding, loose, rocky ascent, at times only 5 feet wide, very difficult for laden animals; then over undulating ground • the descent to the Saqdir (Sakht-dar) stream is easier, the last part being by a zig-zag path.

The village and cultivation extend for about 3 miles. From Deh Bakri to Murghak the valley narrows and the track crosses and recrosses the stream, tire going being loose and stony. At Murghak the road to Bam and to Darzin strikes eff on the right bank of the river. There is low thick jungle for 15 miles either side of the Bakri pass.139 Route No. IX — contd. The road could easily be made practicable for wheels. Fowle (1914) considers this statement unduly optimistic. The Deh Bakri pass, though it offers no difficulties to pack animals, would need considerable repairs before being fit for wheels. Of the 3 passes on this portion of the road,(l) Guzar-i-Murghak is by far the steepiest, stoniest, and most trying to laden animals, the ascent from the S. being very heavy, (2) Guzar-i-Maskun is less difficult than No. 1, the ascent from the S. being much short er, and (3) Guzar-i-Deh Bakri is an easy rise of some 15 minutes from the S., then a series of ups and downs on the long saddle. Stewart considers that the name Murghak should be given to this series of passes. In this stage the village of Deh-Bakri would make for troops a better halting-place than Murghak as making better divi sion of the march from Saqdir to Sarvistan, giving 2 marches of* 18 and 19 miles, respectively, instead of 22 and 15.

At About 82 miles the track gets invloved in a regular network of small nalds coming down from the hills to the left, and to avoid these, as far as possible, the direction changes to almost due E., which direction is continued until 5 miles. At 6| miles the road descends into a large ravine, which forks just where the road strikes it, and the path turns to the left up the further branch. Within the next mile 6 similar ndlds are crossed, a 11 running down to the plain on the right. At 7f miles a shallow dry water-course is reached, fully j mile wide, beyond which is comparatively level ground. At 91- miles the track comes level with the left extremity of a range of hills, which seems to extend nearly across the valley, but with gaps at either end. From here the direction is nearly due N., and at 10^ miles another water-course is crossed with a low ridge beyond it, from the top of which a date-plantation is visible to the E. The water-course is very large, but shallow, and sweeps round from left rear to right. The track now runs towards the date-plantation, which is reached at 11£ miles; it .is only a small one, but has a nice stream flowing through it, with grass on the banks. Passing through the plantation and crossing an intervening ridge at 12 miles the track dips into a dry channel, and follows it down eastwards for a few hundred jards, and then turns by the left bank.

The track con- 267 J tinues down the left bank of the little stream, the descent being very slight. At about \ mile the site of the village of Deh BakrI is passed, surrounded by a considerable area of arable land on both banks of the stream. After about 4 miles the track descends into the bed of the stream at a point where it is con tracted between rocky spurs from the hills on both sides. The little rivulet has by this time become a good-sized stream flowing in a rocky and stony channel about 150 yards wide. The banks are pretty thickly overgrown with willow and tamarisk at this spot. At 5 miles the river-bed is quitted, and the trackRoute No. X — contd. turns up a branch ravine to the right in a south-easterly direc tion. The ascent up the ravine is steep, but the track wide and smooth, difficulty being experienced only when it is covered with snow in the winter time. The top is reached at 5| miles, and looking down on the ravine on the other side a very wide plain is visible beyond. The corresponding ravine on the other side of the ridge bears E. and the track runs down it, not very steeply. Three-quarters of a mile further on it runs up on to the left bank of the ravine and continues along a spur, which gradually sinks down to the lower foot-hills. The next miles are a steady gentle descent down a ridge between 2 of the ndlds, which everywhere intersect the slope from the hills. At 8 miles the track comes down into a water-course formed by the junction of these two ndlds. The track continues along the bed of this ndld for If miles, when it finally emerges on to the bare open plain, which is gravelly and stony, thickly overgrown with tufts of wormwood and other small plants, and has still a slight fall to the front. At 11 miles the direction becomes more easterly, and at 14 miles Bam is visible to the naked eye straight ahead. At 16J miles a small patch of clayey ground is reached, through which runs a dry water-course. At 17J miles another dry water-course is passed. These run out to the left front towards the main stream which flows through the valley, and which is reached at 19J miles. It flows from E. to W. through a very wide channel. The telegraph line from Kirman comes in here. The track goes for a short distance in the bed of the river, but soon ascends again on to the plain on the right bank, which it follows, going E. The river here has a perpendicular-shaped bank of conglomerate about 25 feet high. An extensive village, or group of villages, is visible ahead and, at 24| miles, the right-hand portion of this group of dwellings is reached. There is a zidrat here, with a small octagonal mindr, and the village takes its name from the patron saint, Khwaja Askar. There is a small and very dirty caravanserai.

Epitome. —This is the main caravan and postal route between Bandar ’Abbas and Kerman. As the road, however, lies at a high altitude it is liable to be closed by snow at any time between the middle of December and the middle of March. The route is almost entirely used by donkey caravans, although a few camels may travel over it in the spring and autumn. The route is fit only for pack transport, and it would require a large amount of labour to render it passable for wheeled artillery. Cavalry and infantry could move on a widely extended front for the first four stages. Stage 5 would undoubtedly have to be traversed by cavalry in single file. Broadly speak ing, the road for the first 4 stages is passable for field artillery and motor transport with a little trouble. From stage 5 to stage 9, inclusive, the road is absolutely impracticable for field artillery. From stage 9 to Kerman, it is practicable for field artillery, although at a few places some temporary difficulty might be experienced. Throughout the route there are numerous rivers and water courses to be forded, which in wet weather become dangerous, if not impassable. In the first few stages, and again in one or two later on (stages 9, 13, and 16), the road lies over alluvial clay soil which becomes boggy and slippery in wet weather, even if it does not turn into a regular swamp. The hills being bare rock, rain-water runs off straight away and the rivers resume their normal depth about 24 hours after the rain stops. Physical obstacles .—In stages 1 to 5, and also stages 8 and156 Koute No. XI — contd. 12, the road runs over alluvial soil which in wet weather become slippery, even if it does not become a regular swamp. Stage 2.—The Baghu river in wet weather is dangerous, if not impassable. There are some other streams in the first few stages that would constitute obstacles under similar conditions, but they are comparatively unimportant compared with the river mentioned. The rivers between Baghu and Pariab have sandy bottoms which turn into quick sands after rain, and in their case it takes some little time before they are safe for animals to cross. Stage 5.—The Tang-i-Zindan is extremely dangerous in wet weather. Sudden floods are liable to annihilate whole caravans. This is a difficult stage for even pack animals, owing to its extreme roughness and the impossibility of break ing ^;he stage, which in hot weather is particularly trying. It would require an immense amount of labour and blasting to effect any great improvement. Stage 8.—The hutal on the far side of the Tang-i-Gilak is difficult, rugged, and rocky. Some slight improvement might be effected by clearing some of the loose rocks off the track. Stage 9.—The Rudkhaneh-i-Gashk ,, 12.—The Rudkhaneh-i-Khara „ 12.—The Rud-i-Kiz Kuh „ 13.—The Lalehzar river „ 18.—The Rud-i-Chari Difficult to ford or impassable in wet &gt;■ weather, and at the time of the melting [ of the snows. Transport .—The greater part of the transport used on this route is furnished by donkeys, with a proportion of camels in the spring and autumn. The camels mentioned above (under grazing) are Afghan beasts capable of carrying quite double the load of the local animal, which can scarcely manage more than the regulation Indian mule load. No Afghan camels would, however, be available until the end of December or after the beginning of April. In the hot weather the local camels does fairly well on a diet of dates if he is not overworked, which can very easilv happen. Balfich and Bashakard camels are seldom seen west of Minab, the latter, however, do not appear to do well on the high and cold Persian plateau. All along the road large num-157 Route No. 'Xl—contd. bers of donkeys might be collected, and near Kerman itself a few rnnles, but prices are very high even at ordinary times Miscellaneous.—Yvom. Bandar ’Abbas to Daulatabad the post is carried on donkeys driven by men on foot; from Daulat- abad_ (where there is a Post Office) the post bags are carried Ghapar, viz., horses with changes at stages, and the horses ridden. Climate .—Rain may be expected in fairly heavy showers in the coast plain during December and January at intervals or five or six days, and lasting some six hours at a time ; light showers in November and February, and, exceptionally’ after the middle of March; no monsoon current is felt at Bandar Abbas. In the upper parts of the road, from the end of March to the beginning of November rain practically never falls from nnddle of November to middle of March rain may be ex pected. Snow may be expected on the higher parts of the road irom the middle of December to the middle of March. In the spring when the snow melts the rivers remain deep for some time. ^ Water. Fairly abundant en route and at the halting-places. Fuel. In the coast plain is everywhere scanty, consisting mainly of dry date-sticks and dead date-trunks. One day’s supply for a regiment would probably exhaust the whole avail able supply at any of the first four stages. At most of the halting-places further on fuel can be collected in the shape of thorn-bushes in greater or lesser quantities. Fodder. In the coast plain there is practically no grazing even for camels from May to October. During the winter months camel-grazing is abundant, and some idea may be gained from the fact that during this season at least 3,000 to 4,0W camels find_ their food within a radius of 40 to 50 miles of Bandar ’Abbas. During the summer and early autumn the local-bred camel is fed very largely on dates. On the high- iand, generally speaking, camel-grazing is found everywhere, although it is scarce in the winter months ; and while it would be possible to find a certain amount of forage for mules, horses would probably have to depend almost entirely on carried forage. The poisonous oleander is very common, and great care has to be exercised when animals are grazing to see that none of it is eaten. Supplies. In the lywer parts of the road dates would prove a useful source of food for native troops and followers and could 6 i.158 Route No. Xl—contd. be obtained in large quantities; wheat is scarce although barley is fairly plentiful. The supply of grain varies enormously according to the year’s rainfall. Even after harvest in an ordinary year very little of the grain is exported owing to its all being required for home consumption, whilst in dry years large quantities have to be imported from India. This shows that the supply is limited, whilst the country at the same time is very sparselv inhabited. J Supplies would be found in very small quantities at most of the villages, but if time were available this could be largely augmented from the surrounding districts. The inhabitants of the large villages possess large flocks of sheep and goats Alternative Stages.—{a) From Sar-i-Sikh (stage 5) to Chah-i- Ganda (stage 7) via Pur.

The ground here is a good deal broken up by ravines, and at miles the road descends by an easy gradient into another ndld. On reaching its bed, at about 7 miles, the road turns due north up the channel, or rather bears across it in a long slant. At a little over miles, the far bank is reached, which is about 20 feet high. The road rises on to the bank, and continues north over a sandy plain with a line of low sand hills, about 500 yards to the right. At miles, the track descends abruptly into the bed of a ravine, by a path which offers no difficulties to pack animals, but which would be im practicable for wheels. The rise out of the ndld on the far side is easy, leading out* on to a bare gravel plain, across which the road goes to Kaleh-i-Qazi, population about 250. The inhabitants own large flocks of camels and donkeys. This is a large village with cultivation and date groves. Duzu, 3J miles further on, would probably be a better halting- place for troops, as there is good running water, and the open plain would take a large camp. Water .-—Water from numerous wells ; almost sweet. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder.—Grazing is generally good, but Ducat says it is not so in tJie.autumn.

This canal is the most westerly of 3 canals starting f om near Sarju ; the middle branch runs to Sudarah a - d the Eastern to Takht, after heavy rain the grcund between the Goudu and Sardarah canals is flooded to a depth of 5 fe t, caravans being occasionally held up for 8 or 10 days. At 8 miles the village of Takht, population about 100, is seen a short distance off to the right of the road. At Takht a path goes through the centre -of the village by a stream-bed, which, though habitually used, would be impracticable in wet weather. At 9J miles, a ndld is crossed, and, at 9£ miles, a track leads off to the left to Ahmadj160 Route No. XI— contd. through an opening in the hills. The road runs through a cemetery and then the village of Chahistan, population about 200, on the left, and a date grove, on the right, at 11J miles. From here it lies through good arable land, well-wooded, producing good crops, and showing a considerable amount of grazing, to 14J miles. For the last mile and a half a shingly ridge along the skirts of the hills is traversed. At 15 miles good water for animals. At 16 miles, the village of Khushku,. population about S50, is reached. There is a prominent watch tower on a hill 85 feet high, S. of the village. Chahistan offers better facilities as a camping stage for troops than Khushku, being on open ground with abundant and good water from wells near at hand. The country to the S. of the road only is cultivated, good quantities of barley being grown. This is a cruelly hot place after the beginning of March, being under a bare hill which reflects all the heat of the sun. The first half of this march is through rather heavy going, sandy in places- the last half is over a stony plain, trying to horses. Water .—Good water abundant from canals running from the- Shamil hill spring. Fuel. —Abundant.

Lofty steep mountains slope down on either side to a broad shallow stream meandering along the tang, which has to be crossed several times. At 2f miles, on the hillside to the left, is a perennial spring of sweet water, known as the Ab-i- Shikar. In May 1916, there was no water in this spring. Up to this point the going is fairly good. Then a mile of big boulders. Near the end of Mian Tang, at Sang-i-Buland is a large open space giving sufficient camping ground for a brigade of all arms. Situated in rocky bed of ?id!d, would be dangerous in flood time. Water in ndld brackish but drinkable in Mav, salt later on in the year, good water from spring 100 yards up stream or left bank. Camel-grazing good. At 8£ miles, the stream is left and the track turns up a narrow deep gorge to the right, through which flows a small shallow stream. The gorge winds considerably, but the general direction is a little W. of N. This pass is rightly called Tang-i- Zindan, the prisoner’s pass. Sudden rain storms change the dry bed of the river into a rushing torrent which would destroy any caravan which happened to be in the pass. Such a mishap once befell a caravan of more than a 100 donkeys, all of which were killed. Major Rich, November 1916, gives the following descrip tion of the Tang-i-Zindan — ‘ . : “ At the entrance to the Tang-i-Zindan, the track narrows to 8 yards between high walls of crumbly sandstone of a slope162 Route No. XI — contd. of about 1 and 2, interspersed with loose gravel cut into by deep fissures. The road surface of small shingle is even and good. The mean fall of the river bed along the Tang-i-Zindan is easy, being about 3 degrees and the river bends are not sharp- After a mile the track opens out and the side walls fall away into low broken hills cut up by numerous ravines but the track itself remains good. At 1| miles the high hills close in again and the track nar rows to 30 yards with precipitous sides. The road surface is covered with loose boulders which would require clearing to one side. This continues to If miles, when the hills close in still more and the track narrows to 3| yards for a length of 2 yards, wide enough, however, for a lorry to pass. The track then opens Obstruction 1. b “‘. is ver y b ? d «°'&gt;S for 30 yards, being covered with huge boulders piled on each other in confusion so that for wheels to cross this portion a regular causeway would have to be made by filling in with stone the spaces between the boulders. The track then widens to 50 yards and the going is good over small Obstruction 2. shingle to 2f miles when it narrows to 2 yards for a length of 4 yards. A small amount of blasting would be required to get a lorry through this obstruction. The hills then fall away to each side and the track opens out but is covered up to miles 3f,with big boulders which would have to be levered to one side/ At mile 3f the track is obstructed by three outcrops of solid Obstruction 3. rock 4 feet high, lying across the tract in a line at 5 foot intervals. These could be crossed by wheels by filling in the intervals with stone and building up ramps each side of the rock. At mile 4, the hilte close in to 20 yards and the track becomes covered with huge boulders piled on each other in confusion for 400 yards. *A Obstruction 4. | ot work is required here as the boulders are too big to be removed and a way would have to be cleared by blasting.

The track then opens out to 30 yards but is rough and covered with small boulders. At 6 miles the higher hills fall back and the track is bounded by low foot hills with good going H over fine shingle. A place of. safety could be found here on high ground above flood level for a caravan if caught by a flood but, there is no drinking water. At 7J miles the foot hills end and the higher range closes in. The track remains 30 yards wide but becomes uneven and cut up by numerous dry channels. At 9| miles the tra^k narrows to 20 yards but is good going over fine shingle. At 10 miles the track opens out to 50 yards and at 10J miles the hills close in with almost precipitous walls of solid rock and the track narrows to 12 yards with a surface of solid rock for Obstruction e. a , len § th of 300 yards, in which are three narrow places, each 2 yards wide and 3 yards long, which would require heavy blasting. At 11 miles the actual Tang-i-Zindan is left. This ends the portion of road, in which there is a danger of caravans being over whelmed by floods during the winter season when rain is fre quent. The track then goes up a side ndld for a mile at an easy slope over loose gravel. It then leaves the ndld and winds Obstruction 7 U P a narrow s P ur f° r half a mile at a slope of 8 degrees to the summit of the Sar-i-Sikh at 12£ miles whence the track descends 3 miles to the camping ground at Ab-i-Kahur. This portion of half a mile up the spur would require regular road making to fit it even for dragging a motor car up to the summit as the track is only about 5 feet wide with steep slopes each side and to make it wide enough for a motor would require heavy cutting. The hills forming the sides of the Tang-i-Zindan are mostly lime-stone, subject to land slips with outcrops of hard rock at intervals. These slopes when not precipitous are very irregular and cut up by numerous dry torrent beds.” The summit of the Guzar-i-Sar-i-Sikh is reached at 18 miles.

Ascending out of the ndld at the foot of the Takht-i-Nadirl the track runs over a stony plateau and again dips into the main ndld which passes under the plateau on the right parallel to «• the road. A track also runs down this ndld, but several well- beaten paths lead over the plateau as described. The descent- into the main ndld is steep and rocky through a narrow gorge. The road now winds for about a quarter of a mile and then gain the bed of the Ahmadi stream, which is still saline to the taste. The route now lies along this broad water-way flanked by straight gravelly banks, some 60 feet high. At about 3 miles,, the Rud-i-Pur joins in. Following the main stream for another half mile, the road then branches up a narrow ndld to the right, with a good sandy bed. At the end of the ndld there is a steep but easy rise to a plateau which gradually narrows into a ndld ending in a low watershed. The road crosses this watershed and follows another ndld down to the river. After following tne river for two or three miles, the road passes by a plantation of date palms and ascends another plateau, crosses it, and strikes the river again. The bed is now fpllowed for half a mile, and then it is crossed about 4 a mile from Ahmadi. The road from the river to the village runs across a cultivated plain.

About a mile from the summit Guzar-i- Kafanu, dangerous in winter, 9,579 feet high (Schindler), there is a sunk caravanserai on the left of the road, the brick entrance and doors of which alone show above the ground. The descent is easy into a grassy valley from which the road rises again over a distinct guzdr, on which there is another caravanserai similar to the first. The valley on the western slope of the Kuh-i-Shah is well watered and inhabited in summer by many nomads. Thence it runs into a stony ndld which is followed for .some distance ; and then a somewhat deep ascent precedes a steep descent. The track follows a ndld through the hills down into the valley of Kuh-i-Askar.

The skirts of the Kuh-i-Lalehzar run E. and W., and the road goes nearly due N. Rounding the flat-topped hill the road runs between the low hills till the river is reached, 4 miles, at an easy ford ; two streams, the deeper of which was, in the autumn, about one foot deep, banks about 25 yards across. The further bank is followed to a point oppo site to the small village of Aru where a broad beaten track is reached. The broad track ascends gradually over good soft going, and then descends into a stony ndld. Here the route branches off E.-N.-E. ; at the turn there is an old ruined watch tower on the left and another straight in front. The track follows a stony ndld up an easy gradient to the top, Guzar-i- Zarchu, 12 miles, 8,950 feet (Schindler) and then descends a steep bit, about 200 yards after which the gradient becomes easy down a long stony ndld winding through the hills, and ending in a long ramp on to the Bardsir plain, mile 14 ; spring of good water. The blue dome of the Ziarat-i-Shah shows up very plain, and the village of Surkh Khan is easily seen about half a mile to the right of it.

There is good camel-grazing all over this valley. The pass is very easy and would permit of either cavalry or artillery galloping through. In winter there is often much snow on the pass in which case its passage is difficult. The descent on the N. is very gradual and easy. At the foot of the path to the E. is an old ruined fort, on a prominent hill above which is a watch tower, and further E. under a conical hill a good spring of water. From this the road winds down the dry sandy bed of a ndld through the hills, on the east a high range lies down between the road and lofty snow clad Kuh-i-Jupar. The caravanserai of Chari is reached at 19J miles. There is no village nor are there any houses with the exception of the caravanserai. Ample camping ground for troops.

General direction N. The road crosses a 11 wide open sandy plain to 1 mile, where the bed of a ndld is entered and descended. The banks gradually increase in height until at IJ'miles it joins a wide ravine with a sandy bottom and rocky sides about 30 feet high. The track now ascends out of the ravine, and runs along a fairly straight depression in a plateau showing a gentle sloping surface to the east, and perpendicular broken edges to the west. The track now descends into another ndld at 4J miles, which is crossed close to its junction with a larger ndld immediatelv on the right of the track. The ascent from the ndld is somewhat steeper than the descent. The going is over sheets of sandstone rock. At 5 miles, a rough plateau is reached, over which the track lies to about 8 miles. There are low rocky ridges about 500 yards away to the right, and on the left, the plateau ends in a precipitous, and broken edge, which sinks down into a large water-course on that side. The ground undulates a good deal, but throughout the changes of level, the surface is always the same sheet of solid sandstone rock. At miles the track des cends into another large water channel coming in from the right, T)y a steep and narrow path. This is crossed by a ford just below its junction with another nala coming in from the oppo site side. The track now ascends the latter to 9! miles. The bed is some 200 yards wide, full of huge stones, and bordered by *arps about 40 feet high.

At 7!- miles a low long stone db-ambdr lies to the west of the road after which the going improves. At 9f miles the track branches. Che road following the left branch crosses a small ridge at 10| miles, and almost immediately afterwards, leaving the plain, proceeds westerly, following the course of a gorge, over a rather steep and indifferent track. At 12 miles a small plain is reached, among hills, where there is a palm grove and a water tank. The water runs dry every summer. Close by is a spring strongly impregnated with sulphur. The village of Ginau lies about half a mile further on ; it consists of a few houses ; there are four or five mills turned by water. Water springs from two sources up gorge—one very sulphur ous, the other comparatively free, but both mix about 300 yards up the gorge at a mile. Water. —Foul from a tank.

Mile 6J the track enters a long plateau, undulating and firm. Mile 8 a stony ravine with steep banks 20' is crossed, 100 men, 8 hours, to make it passable for light carts. Track continues over plateau, rocky at first but gradually improves. Mile 11 track descends gradually over firm clay and sand to a lower plateau. Mile 11J—14 firm sandy going among sand hills. Mile 14 sandstone rocks are entered and track drops 40—50'. Only suitable for pack animals here. Track now swings N. and from here to 14f miles the going is good, at first over sandy clay and then over gravel. At 14| miles a river, containing fresh water, is crossed. The river lies about 40 feet below the level of the plain, and its left bank in some parts is a rocky scarp. The route now lies up a rocky ravine on to an open plain of sandy gravel. The river flow on the left, 100 yards distant, and of the right is the end of a rocky spur or ridge. Just before reaching the village of Sarzeh, at 16 miles, the river has again to be forded. The village consists of a few scattered huts. The degree sheet shows the route well but the places marked on the map are not villages. Dorai (two roads) is the place where a track goes off to the east. Medan and Khurijud are places where water has been found. Water .—Good and abundant from river. Fodder .—Grazing for camels good. In March 100 maunds (Tabriz!) good hay was obtained from hills 1 mile W. Supplies. — Nil. 6 acres of Kasil (wheat) obtained. 4 ZURAIU . 18 m. General direction for the first three-quar- 57 ters of the stage N. E., and for the last quarter N. W. Bad going on exit from camp and track undefined in ndld and along the right bank for one mile. Follow the right bank of the stream for 1 mile.. From here the track runs across the plain keeping a ridge con tinuously on the right. The plain, known as the Sahra-i- Dardam, is 4-5 miles wide, and is followed for 8 miles. At mile 4 a stony ndld is crossed, descent narrow and animals have to go in single file. At 2| miles a river-bed with a stony channel, 100 yards wide, is crossed. The road now runs over the stony plain to about 6J miles, where it bends to the left round the end ofRoute No. Xll—contd. ■a spur of a long rocky ridge. On the other side of the spur the .road drops into a river-bed which is continually crossed and re-crossed up to 11 miles. The track is very stony and rocky and animals have to go in single file, progress slow. Impassable for carts without a month’s work of 1 Company of Pioneers. At 12J miles a small palm grove is passed some few hundred yards off to the left. The open plain of Barak is on the right At 14£ miles the village of Gishan is passed 2-3 miles off to the right. In March 1917, the Shiraz Column halted at Gishan. They reported that the whole march to that place from Sarzeh was difficult and trying. Miles 7 to 12 being in a naU should be completed in the early morning. There was a gradual ascent of about 1,000 feet in the day’s march. Sufficient water at Gishan for a Brigade from the stream. Supplies, scarce. Graz ing unlimited for camels. On the right commences a great ridge of sloping strata which runs parallel to the track. The river runs all the way parallel on the right to 16J miles, where it is crossed. An ascent of 100 feet is now made to a stony plateau, 200 yards broad, and having a broad water-course on either hand. At 18 miles the hamlet of Zuratu is reached It lies immediately under the range of smooth hills which bounds the S.-W. side of the valley. Water .—Good and abundant from a spring at the base of the hill. Supplies .—Very scanty. 5 AB MAR CAMP . 16J m. General direction ~~ W. N. W. Proceed /d 2 up the valley over a stony upland and descend gradually over undulating ground* At 3 miles a nald is Crossed and an ascent made to the top of a. small kutal at 4 miles, At 4| miles a tributary flows into the water-course on the left. The track lies down the river-bed which is narrow, and the going bad. At 6 miles the river widens out, and the road continues across a more open stony plain. The palm groves of Guhra now come in sight. The Shiraz Column halted at Guhra in March 1917. They reported that the last 4 miles of the route were very stony and that, generally the track from Gishan was more difficult than appeared from the description of the route. Water at Guhra sufficient for a186 Route No. XII— contd. Division from an ab-ambar ; also a spring of sweet water near the village. Supplies in small quantities on notice being given. Grazing unlimited for camels. The direct road to Ab-Mar leaves Guhra on the west, and makes for the village of Kutawad. At 7-|- miles a river-bed is crossed, and an ascent made over a stony plain on the far side. At 9 miles is the village of Kutawad. From here the route lies up a gradually narrowing valley bounded on the east by conglomerate and mud cliffs. The going is stony. At 12 miles the hamlet of Marakun is passed on the S.-W. 300 yards off the road. Here the valley narrows, and at 12£ miles begins to widen again. The road now crosses from the” S. W. to the N. E. of a valley lying close under a hill, at 14f miles. Thence across the valley again over stony ground to Ab-Mar, lying on the N. E. side of the valley at 16J miles. Here are a few houses. It is better to go on another 4-J- miles further north, where there is a little water in a ndld; it shortens the next stage. Leaving Ab-Mar, direction N. E. the valley widens out into an open plain bounded on the N. E. by a lofty range. The road then swings round and assumes a northerly direction, a ridge of hills being close on the right. From here the route lies over a stony plateau for about a mile and then drops down into a ndld by the left bank. A few hundred yards further on, a trickle of sweet water emerges from shale in the bottom of the ndld.' There is a good camping-ground on the left bank above this water. It is not stated whether this water is peren nial. The time of year, at which the trickle was found as. stated, was in the beginning of April. Camping ground.—Good 4± miles N. of Ab-Mar. Water .—Good but limited. Supplies. —Scarce. ..

(gravel) 30 yards wide banks 30'—40' on W. and a high stony hill on E. The going is heavy and confined to ndld bed.Route No. XII—cow^, Mile 3J the track leaves ndId and proceeds N. E. over undulating ground for' another mile when it again enters a narrow ndld. The ground here is broken up by a succession of small ndld, and low hills. Mile 5 the ndld is left and the track crosses a watershed (4,100') and then descends E. to Kala-i-Kah, Mile 7J, the first 500 yards of descent being over sheets of rock. The camping ground is 1,000 2,000 yards S. W. of a well marked mauve colored hill of volcanic nature. This portion of the stage is very trying on animals, owing to its stony nature. The degree sheet shows route well. Water at Kala-i-Kah for drinking from holes dug in ndld bed. Sweet and sufficient for 1 Brigade. Water for animals 600 yards E. down ndld below camp, several pools of good water. Supplies, nil. Grazing for camels unlimited. Leaving Kala-i-Kah, after J mile in W. direction, track bends X. W. and enters the Tang-i-Zagh which is a narrow defile from 50 yards broad, about 4 miles long, and between cliffs 300'—1,200' above ndld bed. The track lies along the ndld bed over fine shingle and sand and a good pace can be main tained except for a few rocky places. The general direction is X. W. At about J mile from the northern exit of the defile the bed of the ndla is a series of rocky pools, which the track traverses for 80 yards and then ascends and goes along a level strip of conglomerate rock 10 yards wide, 20'—50' above the ndld bed. The rocks at this point are extremely hard, water worn and difficult for any but the camels of the country. Animals can only proceed in single file and at a very slow pace at this point. An animal falling here might block the track for a considerable time. It is advisable to send a wo. king party well ahead through the Tangi. The passage through the rocky pools here can be rendered easier for laden animals by filling in with stones. This place without improvement is difficult for ail pack animals. Government mules must be un-hitched and led singly. To make a permanent road through the Tangi it would have to be above flood level, and owing to the sheerness of the cliffs this would entail a large amount of blasting and gallery work. Xo piquetting operations are possible from within the Tangi itself. Parties to flank the march of a column through the Tangi must be sent out before entering it. This entails a 7188 Route No. XII — contd. steep climb of about 1,300' to N. W. 600' to E. side. On emerg ing from the Tangi the track swings N. W. down a nal% bed. At mile 15 Ab-i-Din is reached. There is a stream of good water in a qanat. The ascent from the nail is bad and over slab The track then goes N. W. over an open stony plain—fair for pack animals. Mile 19 a nullah is crossed and the track enters low mud hills (30' 80'), the going here is on firm clay and good and at mile 24 Sa’adatabad is reached on a flat stony plain. Water. Is good from a qanat from Ab-i-Din. Stream in qanat 6' deep 24' wide 1 mile per hour velocity. {March 17.) This appears to be the only supply. The well mentioned in the route book, does not, apparently, exist. Supplies .—Some goats, sheep available and barley. Grazing for camels unlimited. ■kt 0T e Sa’adatabad is locally pronounced Saatabad. Thorburn reports tiint in Sentember 1917 the Ab-i-Din Kanat had been broken and the water dis appeared in the river bed about 1 mile N. E. of the N. and of Tangi Zagh.— S’aadatabad had no water and was deserted. 7 GAKtM -10 m. General direction N. by W. The village of 1071 Gakum lies at the N. E. extremity of the alluvial plain, in the S. E. corner of which lies the village of Sa’adatabad. The route at first lies over a stony plain, gently ascending, and at 3J miles the remains of a former town is passed among jungle. It is known as Sar-i- Chahan and is now nothing but mud heaps. Two wells, water very muddy but sweet from one well, saltish in other. At 4 miles a ruined mud tower is passed 500 yards to the right of the road. The going is good. At 4J miles the jungle ceases, and the track continues good, over pat, for the rest of the stage. At mile 5 track crosses a salt stream, 9 to 15 feet wide. This is a slippery place and animals have difficulty in crossing. It is advisable to send a small party ahead to lay down grass and tamarisk ; cutting tools required. The direction is towards a volcanic mass lying at the base of the range bounding the N. E. side of the plain. The range is the Khh-i-Gakum. At 6| miles the volcanic mass is reached and passed to the right. At miles the road strikes across the plain for the corner of the Gakum date groves.

Wa for 1£ _ mdes over pat,’ going good. It then swings N. past a ruined caravanserai and ascends a gorge through a spur of the Kuh-i-Gakum. The going here is stony and rocky and the track gets narrower At 2-- miles it rises steeply (5°—7°) out of the nail bed on to a stony plateau. This piece of the road is bad and would require blast ing to improve it. It then descends by a narrow Zig-zag bend to a nlla and goes E. along left bank, passing through low hills. The crossing of this spur can be avoided by a detour througn Tarum. At mile the track crosses the stream to the right bank ; 600 yards further on it again recrosses to the left bank. The bed of the stream is marshy and a party should be sent ahea,d to improve this for pack animals by laying down reeds^ which are plentiful,—cutting tools required. After this dossing, the track bends N. along the left bank for J mile and at mile 6J bends N. W. The stream is very marshy, and although the ordinary camel track follows the bank and marsh for about 100 yards, with a large number of animals, they must be diverted along a rough and difficult track on the hill side above. 30 men can make this passable in 15 minutes. From this point the track goes for 2 miles through small hills and nalas and follows the course of the stream—firm shingles At mile 8 stream is crossed twice. There is a camping ground for at least 1 Brigade at M. SJ water good and sufficient from stream. Kuldan—a small grove of palm trees is J mile further on—the village has been destroyed. The 4' 1 M. Degree sheet gives a very false impression of the country from Pasad Nun—Kuldan. The country is a mass of small hills and ravines. Supplies nil —a little grass in nala f^^and a few fields of wheat Kasil in March. Camel grazing 1 mile from Kuldan a bluff of rocky hill runs out into the stream, forcing the track into a bad bit of marsh. A working 7 a190 Route No. XII — contd. party (30 men 2 hours, stone and fascine work) should be sent ahead. An alternate diversion is the upper track (50' above). This can be quickly made passable for camels in single file. After this point the track crosses by a stony crossing to the left bank and turns N. E. along the left bank to M. 13. The going is firm and good. AtM. 13 the stream is again crossed—crossing marshy and a small working party of 15 men, £ hour, required. From this going firm to Hajiabad. The country on each side of the track is very broken by small underfeatures (30'—150') and ravines up to Hajiabad. Hajiabad consists of a date palm grove with a fort surrounded by huts on the top of a hill. Extensive cultivation. In a good year 5,000 to 6,000 (Tabrizi) maunds of wheat and barley would be produced. Camping ground. N. of the village, across the ndld running S. from the Tang-i-Niza. Water. —From wells—plentiful, grazing, good for camels to the south. Note. —The Shiraz column broke this stage at Kuldan as, owing to the difficult nature of the track, their leading echelon only reached Hajiabad at 11 p.M. 9 KUKAN .28 m. General direction N. N. W. The route 151J lies direct towards the Tang-i-Niza, which is entered at about 2 miles. The going is stony, and mountains lie close on either hand. At 6 miles, a water-mill is passed, and at 7 miles the village of Niza. Water good and sufficient for 2 brigades; 2,000 Tabrizi maunds of wheat were available when the Shiraz Column halted here in March 1917 ; fuel abundant; camel grazing, good. At 8 miles there are cultivation, palms, and wells on both sides of the tang. At 10 miles the road leaves the left bank of the ndld and ascends over an open plain, crossing the river bed at 11 miles from left to right, and then over an open plain. At 13 miles the track again crosses the river, and keeps close under a ridge on the right hand. The road continues up this river-bed, on one bank or the other, and often in the actual river-bed. At 17 miles a rocky hill is passed immediately to the right. At 21J miles a larger rocky hill, rising about 1,000 feet above the river bed, is passed, also to the right.

Then the route lies up the bed of the stream. At 28 miles, the village of Kukan is reached, which lies about quarter of a mile off to the E. of the road over a small ridge which hides it. The road from Hajiabad to Saidabad (Stage 12) is reported fit for motors. ■The village cultivation lies to the E. in a valley. Water .—Good from spring, but limited. Supplies. —Limited. 10 CHAH GABRIS- 21 m. General direction N. ■ TAN. The road proceeds up 172} the valley over stony and undulating ground ; the valley here is about a mile wide. At 2} miles the road mounts a small rise, from which point the hills of Chah-i-Chagak come into view 9 miles ahead across a gently rising plain. On the left there is a tower on a hill-top ; the Chah-i-Chagak pass lies just under this tower to the E. At A miles about half a mile W. of the road, there is a small pool of stagnant water in a qandt. At 6 miles a ruined tower is passed to the E. of the road. The route lies over a slightly un dulating and gently rising plain, overgrown with scrub making in a northerly direction towards the mountains. At 10 miles the ascent increases. At 11} miles there is a well of sweet water under a tree 50 yards to the W. of the track, known as the Chah Kisur. Water good, and, when the well is full, sufficient for 1 battalion for 1 day. The ascent continues rather steeper, but never difficult, over a well-wooded mountain slope. At 12 miles the Gudar-i-Chah-i-Chagak is reached. There is a gradual descent over well-wooded and somewhat undulating country. At 13} miles the track enters a fairly level plain with a gradual descent. The well of Chah-i-Chagak lies to the E. of the road. Water good. When the Shiraz Column halted here in March 1917, the well was used for washing and drinking by 800 men .and v ent dry in 7 hours, refilled in 12 hours. This well and the one at Chah Kisur will suffice for 1 Brigade for 1 day with careful use. At 19} miles the point of the spur of a range lying on the N. N. W. is passed. At 21 miles Chah Gabristan is reached lying under the S. face of a limestone ridge.192 Route No. XII — contd. Water .—Good but limited, from a well. Fodder .—Grazing plentiful. Supplies—Nil. This stage is now fit for motors. 11 MALIKABAD . 23 m. General direction N. The track makes for 195| a spur 5 miles dis tant which cuts into the plain from a range on the W .; it is known as the Puzeh-i-Khun. Between this place and Chah Gabristan there are 7 wells. The one at Puzeh-i-Khun is well built with bricks. Depth to water level, 12 feet. Refills at once ; water good . The other wells referred to are reported to be of a similar nature. They are flush with the ground and difficult to see. At 3J miles there is a well not easily noticed among the scrub. At 5 miles the Puzeh-i-Khun is reached. Up to here the plain is covered with scrub, but beyond Puzeh-i- Khun it is pat without any vegetation. The direction is N. There is a range on the left which is gradually quitted. For the next 10 miles, there is bare level pat. At 15 miles the track enters scrub. At 17 miles a ruined fort is passed on the left of the road. At 21 miles the fortified village of Amirabad. At 23 miles Malikabad is reached, which is a large village with a strongly built fort lying at the southern edge of the village. Camping ground .—In gardens | mile S. of the fort.

In places the plain is cultivated and towards the end of the stage it is very stony. At 8f miles an db-ambdr is passed. The road throughout the stage leads almost directly ■on to the Kuh-i-Khan-i-Surkh which can be seen in the distance. At 16^ miles the village of Sa’adatabad is reached, which is fairly large (population, 3,000) and has a caravanserai. Water .—Good and abundant from stream and wells. Supplies. —Scarce. 14 KHAN-I-SURKH 27 m. General direction N. E. 7,800'. The track lies over a 254 plain in some parts stony, and as the mountains are approached the track becomes undulating. The route at first lies on the crest of one of the low wave-hke ridges thrown out from the mountain chain in front. At 7J miles the road descends into the dry bed of a water-course, where it becomes rather stony. The water-course is ascended; the ascent is easy and the road is good. At 11 miles a stream, with irrigation channels, is reached, where there is some cultivation. At 11 miles the road enters into the mountains, and a mud hovel known as the Bid-i-Khwah is reached. The stream is still ascended, being closely shut in by steep hills. In the bed are a good many trees. Then a more open country, although somewhat hilly, amongst the mountains is reached. The hills are gently sloping, and there is a good deal of cultivation, but there are no habitations of any kind. At 18 miles the road ascends, but the track is good. At 19| miles the solitary caravanserai of Sang-i-Tu is passed. At 20£ miles the Gudar-i-Surkh 8485’ is reached, the ascent being easy. The peak of the Kuh-i-Surkh is about 400 yards distant to194 Route No. XII — contd. the E. The route descends along gently sloping hills, following the bed of a dry water-course in northerly direction. From the bed of the water-course, the point of a spur on the right is rounded, and a large valley running N. E. and S.

At 9J miles there is water near the road. At 10 miles the valley opens, and later another valley opens out to left running up towards the X. W. and the W. At Ilf miles there is an irrigation channel of good water. At 13f miles the road runs between low hills ; there is some scrub and small thorny bushes. The road now' lies directly on the peak of the Kuh-i-Mashiz. This mountain is a long one with several peaks ; the village of Mashlz lies to the E. of it. The road continues down an open valley, bounded by low hills with scrubby thorns. At 18f miles a broad channel is crossed near a ruined fort, with a stream of good water in it, and a little cultivation. This might be made a halting point for troops. A few villages are passed on the right, and at 21 miles the ruins of Kaleh Muhammadabad is seen on the right. At 22f miles there is a descent and on the left of the road are the remains of a small square fort, while on the right is Gurnai, a small village. The going now 7 is more undulating.

At 2| miles the Ab-i-Lalehzar, a good stream of water, is crossed. At 4 miles the road enters low hills, and ascends easily out of the ■broad Bardsir valley to 6f miles, where a little pass leads into a small plain ; this is about a couple of miles wide, and is crossed in a north-easterly direction. The plain is bare. At 8|- miles the plain is quitted by another small pass, and then the road lies amongst low rocky hills still rising easily, to the first crest of the Gudar-i-Dukhtar, from which there is a nasty stony descent. The bottom, which is 300 feet below the crest, is succeeded by a somewhat steep climb to the second pass at the same altitude as the first. This is gained at 9| miles, and the track runs down a narrow and rocky defile to the caravanserai of Khan-i-Kuh, which is reached at 114 miles. Directly beyond the caravanserai the road to Baghin branches off to the left. The road leads down the defile, and at 13| miles, an immense plain is reached, stretching N. E. to Akbarabad and Baghin, the former of which is visible from here [11 miles distant.] At 174 miles a line of qanat wells is reached, stretching up and down the plain as far as can be seen : at 194 miles another line of qandts, and an abandoned fort a mile to the right of the road. The plain up to this is bare, from here it is clothed with thorns and tufts. At 22| miles the Rud-i-Chari is crossed flowing from the S. E. At 23 miles cultivation commences. The village of Baghin lies two miles to the left at the base of a mountain. The S. E. end of the mountain is close to the village. At 24 miles there is an irrigation stream of fresh water, and the road turns sharp round to the E. to the villages of Akbarabad and Khairabad. The villages of Akbarabad and Khairabad are wretched places. Water .—Good and abundant from qandts. Supplies. —Scarce. Some could be collected from the neigh bourhood. 17 KERMAN . 14J m.

On the left is a mountain about a mile distant: this is the end of the mountain above Baghin. The road skirts the eastern end of it. To the right the plain stretches a great dis tance to high mountains. At 5| miles cultivation begins and there is a good stream of clear water. Here the plain of Kerman begins to open up to the left at the back of the hill which the road has-been skirting. At about 9 miles, the main road from Yazd, via Bahramabad, joins in on the left. At 9-|- miles there is a well and a rest-house, from which point the first sight of the city of Kerman is obtained. From here the cultivation is continuous until the town is reached, which is entered at the xazdi gate close to the ark or palace of the Governor.

Epitome. —The Bansar is one of the easier passes through the Sianeh Kuh and with a few days’ labour could be made suitable for wheeled artillery. The passes, so far as known, are the following :— (1) the Grawag and Zurati defiles between the Sianeh Kuh and the Kuh-i-Sabz, and through the former (S. B. routes Nos. 75 to 81). (2) The Bazkaruch and Hetai passes, both difficult for laden camels (S. B. Route No. 80). (3) The Rag Pass N. of Kuhak. This is reported to be easy, but full information is not on record. (4) The Bansar Pass, the present route, the most direct from this part of the Mashkel valley to the N- and with the best water supply. (5) The Brinunan Pass. Routes III {d) and III (e). In the extension of this range to the N. W. commonly called the Siahan Kuh, there are several small passes leading N. E. and N. from Bizak. There is no definite information regarding these, but all are believed to be practicable only for very lightly laden camels. (6) The Badamo Pass between Gusht and Nahu, Route III tg).

The descent to the Shirandu. Kaur and that from the Bansar Kutal are at present impracticable for guns, but as the whole distance is short, a few days’ labour would suffice to make it passable. With these exceptions the march is easy. The Bansar Kutal cannot be turned in its immediate vicinity. Water. —Perennial. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder. —At 15 miles, grass.

This march is easy and practicable for all arms. Perennial water in the Kalagan till it is left, but none between miles If and 12J. The Jalk palm groves are some 5 miles in length and are well cultivated, the chief crops being jowari, wheat and rice. Them are 9 forts within four square miles, and a very mixed population possibly 4,000 in all, in a number of scattered villages and hamlets : besides Buzurgzadas, whose head, Mirmadad Khan, is the hakim of Jalk, there are Rekis (headman, Mir Lalla Khan, died in December 1917, at a great age), Sipais, who claim Afghan origin (headman Jalal Khan), Rais, and many Naqxbs. The Yarmuhammad Zais, and probably other Damanis own date trees, but only visit Jalk during the hdmin or date harvest. The position is important, standing on the trade route from part of Kharan and the eastern Sarhad to the S. through the passes of the Sianeh Kuh. Caravans annually bring wheat for Kharan to exchange for dates in the Mashkel valley and look further afield. There is no direct trade with the coast. Camping grounds .—Room for 50 men and 50 animals near Shishriz fort. A larger force would find unlimited good ground and good water one mile X. of the fort at the edge of the cultivation ; also at the northern end of the groves, at the head of a kariz, 3 miles beyond the fort.

At 5 miles the road 26 having hitherto des cended gently between parallel ranges, enters the Pahura ndkl (a tributary of the Jalk river) and ascends it; at mile 9 the road leaves the Pahura ndld and turns to the left, crossing the Pir Kahur Kutal and descending into the main Jalk river at miles 11 ; kutal easy, but would need some work to mate it passable for guns. From mile 11 the road ascends the Jalk river-bed (here called the Nahu ndld) to Aahu, 14 miles. Road good all the way, but would require considerable preparation to make it fit for wheels. The Baranzao, who now hold Dizak, own property in Nahu, and claim overlordship. Tne population are chiefly Rais and other Baluch ; something under 100 houses. They own a fair number of sheep, which are grazed with the flocks of the Gamshadzais, in the hills in summer and the valleys from Dizak to Gusht and Paskuh in the winter. There is a large date grove and considerable cultivation. ^TFcher.—At Nahu Fort plenty of excellent Kdriz water.212 Route No. 2— contd. Fuel. —Fairly abundant.

At 2J miles the road descends into the Sargaz ndld (called also the Pahura ?idld, a tributary of the Jalk river), and ascends its bed till mile 8. Here the road crosses a low clay kutal and descends into the Nubar ndld at mile 9 (this is a tributary of the Mashkil river). The road onwards ascends the valley of the ndld to the halting place. At mile 10, at a place called Patkur, sweet water is obtained 3 feet from the surface, and several wells exist. Here grass and grazing abundant and wood obtainable.

In stage 10 it enters the Mashkel valley which it follows to Grawag at the junction of the Mashkel and Rakhshan rivers. Stages 6, 7 and 8 are passable for field guns ; for the rest of the distance, although numerous deep and steep ndlds are crossed, there is nothing to prevent the construction, with the labour available in the country, or by Pioneers, of a track passable by field guns and even motor cars. The nates near Kuhak and Ispandak are the worst, but not much worse than those successfully overcome near Merui on the Nushki-Robat road. Picquetting unnecessary, except for a few miles after crossing the Rohtak in stage 8, and possibly one or two points in stage 12. Elsewhere flank ing parties sufficient and able to keep up with column. Camping ground. —Ample everywhere. Water. —Sufficient with care (October 1916) for 350 men, their animals and transport at stages 1 and 2 ; ample but inclined to be brackish at 3 and 4 ; abundant at 5 ; fair at 6 to 8 ; good thereafter. Fuel. —Procurable throughout; generally plentiful in stages 6 to 10. Fodder. —Grazing generally abundant, except at stages 6 and 7 where it is fair.

A very gentle descent 69 down the Rohtak valley which is 10 to 12 miles broad. The river, which at this point is known as the Rudgwar, lies towards the S. side of the valley. There are no well marked drainage channels on the N. slopes of the valley, which are accordingly liable to flooding. The road would therefore be difficult for camels after heavy ram, but the soil dries quickly. At 10 miles a small well, Dostan Chah, water said to be fairly good. After that the Shirwan karez is followed for 4 miles and 16 miles Shirw r an is reached. Small fort village containing 50 to 60 houses of Dehwars, and some 10 of other Baluchis. Camping ground. —Some 600-650 yards beyond the village on stony “ dan ” ground on the S. side of the Shirwan kdrez. Area unlimited. Water. —From the kdrez, a good supply, but slightly brackish.

Probably sheep and goats in winter.218 Route No. 3 — contd. 5 SIB .. 16J m. General direction S» E. The road crosses 85£ a level plain. At 2 miles the ruined buildings of Tul-i-Fatima. At about 4J miles cross the karez Kan-i-Karam Shah. Passing several hamlets comprising the “ township ” of Suran the road reaches Sib at 16 £ miles. Sib belongs to Mir Ghulam Rasul, Buzurgzada, a very intelligent old chief, whose ildqa extends from Dehak on the E. to Paskuh on the N. W. and Gusht on the N., and includes the country round Hiduch and Kant on the S. The fort on the N. of the village is a substantial building of mud. It can be approached within a few yards on three sides through the village : on the N. E. the ground is bare and devoid of cover for several miles to the hills, but by taking advantage of un dulations it would be possible to bring guns to a range of about 800 yards without coming under fire. Population about 400 houses; Dehwars (the best cultivators), Baluch of various sections, Sepahis (the same tribe as at Jalk), and Naqlbs.' There is one well-to-do shopkeeper, Dadrehman, a Kenakzai from Panjgur, who is also Mir Ghulam Rasul’s Vakil, and numerous smaller Sauddgars, usually cultivators who have saved a little money. There are other shops at Suran (see Route No. IV (1). Date groves, fully 4 miles long, with rich land among the trees ; several gardens with grapes, apricots, pomegranates, figs and other fruits. The dates are of many varieties, some excellent. Camping ground. —Unlimited on the N. E. side of the groves. The best is that mentioned above. IFafer.—-There are several karezes of which the best and sweetest is that mentioned above. There are also several springs, but they are reputed unwholesome. Fuel. Is brought in from some distance by arrangement with the people. Fodder. Grazing and grass, at a distance of a mile. Good supply all up the Rohtak and also near Apatan 6 miles to the N. N. W. Some bhusa and karbi procurable.

Passing for a 1441 few hundred yards down the E. side of the kalag, then across a stony plain ; at about 1 mile descend into Nahich Kaur and pass a small walled building, a village of 10 to 12 houses, and a kalag of the same name on left. Rising again cross a dreary stony plain to 3J miles and descend into the Bazm Kaur. At 4j miles a solitary hinar (ber) tree marks the boundary between Sib and Kuhak. More undulating country to 81 miles, Naijag, a few small pools of water and scattered trees. Looking back from a ridge at about lOJ mile Dehak can be seen against the sky line. At 121 miles the prosperous kalag of Murt. At 13J miles the small inhabited kalag of Darin Chah is passed on the right and at 131 miles Nahin on the left. At Isfandak there is a small fort in bad repair ; a small tillage, inhabitants nearly all Kunarbastis (JBaluch); a small date gro\ e. It is under Kuhak and has some strategical im portance, from its position at the mouth of one of the passes through the Sianeh Kuh to Jalk, and within reach of the passes by which Routes 111(c) and I1I(J) connect the Mashkel valley with the country to the South.

At I731 about J mile leave the river bed and follow its ‘left bank at a distance of about 1 mile from the river crossing numerous kaurs. At about 10 miles Naijag, with a small stream of good water and 4 date trees. About 1H miles incline to E. N. E. to about 16J miles, where the track bends more to N. to circle round the Kuhak village. The track, which /for the entire journey lies over stony and undulating country, but is easy on the whole, here becomes rougher and the nftlds steeper. Kuhak consists of several small clusters of huts round a date grove about a mile long but narrow ; a few more substantial houses near the fort on the W. side, which is fairly strong but commanded from the hills bounding the valley at short range. Kuhak belongs to a junior branch of the Naushirwam family, the head of which is the Sardar of Kharan. The present rulers are Mir Mehrab Khan and his brother Mir Qadir Bakhsh. Until the beginning of the present century, Kuhak was con- sidered to be part of Mekran, but the last Boundary Commis sion gave it to Persia. The Naushirwanis of Kuhak own pro perty in Makran, and all theii connections are with the east ; rather than with the W. The Kuhak ildqa extends from near Dehak on the W. to the Makran boundary about 44 miles E. of the village, and from the crest of the Sianeh Kuh to the N. to an undefined boundary with the Bampusht ildqa (under222 Route No. 3— contd. Dizak) near the Mirgindar hills to the S. The date groves of Kalagan, S. of Jalk, are also at present in the possession of Mir Mahrab Khan, who seized them after the murder of the former owner Mir Madat Khan, Naushirwani. His possession cannot however be regarded as secure. Except for the date groves and patches of cultivation on the N. side of the Mashkel and some fine grazing grounds S. of the river it contains little of value. It has however some stratagical importance as commanding the mouth of the Rag Pass, by which the telegraph line crosses the Sianeh Kuh, and which is reported to be the first easy pass west of the Mashkel gorge, and also the Gaz- bastan Tank (see Route 111(b)). Whoever holds Kuhak can pre vent raids from the Damani and Bampur countries into N. Makran. The population is mixed ; a very few families of Naushirwanis, a few claiming connection with the Buzurgzadas ; the bulk of the cultivators are Kunarbastis, and of the lower classes Naqibs ; altogether, probably, between 400 and 500. Camping ground ,—For a battalion at the upper end of the grove ; unlimited at the lower end, but the water supply not so good. Water .—At the upper end, from two good springs, one feeding the Nokiuh ; at lower end from a smaller spring which would have to be cleaned out in advance. F ml. —Plentiful. Fodder .—Grass and grazing, fair. Supplies.—A little milk and some eggs ; a small quantity of surplus dates after the harvest, but the village scarcely feeds itself and imports grain. 13 GRAWAG .. 11 m. General direction E.

About 3,600'. ~ Pass N. of Sib fort 201 and village and through isolated patches of date trees which extend for about 3| miles. After a short open space the groves of Dehan begin, and Dehan village is left on the right at 5 miles. A stony plain to nearly 7 miles where the track passes a hollow with a stream of salt water, and 200 yards further on Pirugaraf, a pool of evil smelling very salt water, surrounded by salt efflore- sence. There is a small zidrat here and the water is believed to have healing properties. About 8 miles cross the Jasdar Kaur, and at 9J miles reach Chaho, a small pool of water on the surface ; there is said to be more water higher up the kaur. Looking back from a ridge 10J miles Sib fort and groves can be seen in the distance and to the S. the kalag of Gwarnagan224 Route No. 3— contd. (stage 1 of main route). At 12£ miles the direct, but waterless, track to Dehak branches off to the right; the Dukop track is the better marked. About 13 miles cross the Shamshir Kaur and soon afterwards the Charpan Kaur, coming from the Charpan pass to Dizak (Route 4, alternative A) which lies on the left; after it the Sohrab Kaur. From here the track which has tended downwards begins to rise gently again; about 15J miles the low watershed between the Rohtak and Simish is crossed, and the track rounding the lower spurs of the Sunt-i-Puza turns slightly N. of E. Directly afterwards, the track from Dizak to Purchinan Daf (Route III) is crossed. Thereafter a series of low ridges, not troublesome are crossed and the double hill—Dukop—is reached. One hill is white and crumbly, the other of hard conglomerate, chiefly black with stones of very varied colours. Camping ground for more than a battalion. Water. —From a spring in the rock, plentiful and sweet. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder.—Grazing and grass plentiful. Supplies. — Nil. No inhabitants, but many parties of graziers visit the spring. Picquetting. —Necessary at places from about mile 16: elsewhere flank guards sufficient. 2 DEHAK .. 15 m. General direction a 3,780' little S. of E. Down 35^ the Dukop Kaur past a few pools of brackish water, over stony ground and in and out of this kaur and the Nar Kasi Kaur which it joins lower down. At about 4J miles rejoin the direct track from Sib to Dehak. About 6 miles leave the Nar Kasi Kaur by its left bank and cross stony plain. Cross three tracks leading from Dizak respectively to Sar-i-Jangan (Route III) Maindar and Murti. Reaching the right bank of the Simish, follow it down for J mile, then descend into the bed of the river, which is crossed about 7J miles : no water was flowing here (in October 1916) but there were pools above and below. The bed is sandy, with patches of mud. J mile further on cross a much used track by which the people of Dizak fetch fuel from the bed of the Mashkel. On over the Zard Kikian Dan. At 8J miles cross the Zard Kikian Kaur. 10 miles, pass the KabarakanBoute No. 3— contd. kalag lying 2£ miles to the right. About 11 miles the upper Chah Daran kalag is seen about 3 miles to the left, and about 11J miles pass the lower kalag of the same name with a good stream of water, 8-10 houses and some fruit trees : a little further on the kdrez of that name is crossed. At 12 miles the large kalag of Pirabad is seen H miles to right. At nearly 14 miles the small kalag of Kunardan ; just past it tracks from Dizak (Route 111(c)) and Pirabad (main route) come in from left and right. Piqicettvig. —Unnecessary. ALTERNATIVE STAGES (B). ISFANDAK (Stage 10) TO KUHAK (Stage 12). General remarks.—Thin is longer than the main track and marches more laborious for camels : it has no advantages unless it is desired to visit Kunarbast. Piquetting unnecessary with advance and flank guards. 1 KUNARBAST .. 10 m. General direction a 3,610'. little N. of E. Keep- 10 ing round the N. E. side of the grove, enter a stony plain, broken by numerous ndlds, with a tendency upwards. At 5 miles the large spring of Nilgindab; another spring at 5J miles. Several more deep ndlds are crossed and the track bends E. N. E. to the N. end of the Kunarbast grove, which is fairly large and surrounded by smad clusters of huts, some of pish, some of blankets and some of mud, about 60-70 in all. The population are mainly Kunarbastis, and seem to have colonised Isfandak and a good deal of Kuhak, though Kunarbast is now the smallest of these places. Camping ground .—Rather rough but enough for a battalion. Water .—From a good karez above the kalag. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder .—Grass fair ; grazing plentiful. Supplies. — Nih, perhaps a few eggs and a little milk.226 Route No. 3— concld. 2 KUHAK .. 22 m. General direction E, Pass through the N. 32 end of the grove and over a stony plain, descend into a small kaur. At 1J miles the camel track branches to the right and takes a lower line to avoid a number of steep places ; it is 1|—2 miles longer than the bridle path. The latter passes a number of neglected groups of date trees in deep kaurs with steep banks, to 5| miles, Dar Razen Kan kaur, 7 miles, Askan and Kalok kalags, 9 miles Gishag Kaur, with some water from a spring, Gishag and Dehwar kalags. After the last of these is passed, the camel track rejoins the bridle path. 10 miles Bunap kalag. 10J miles Sohtagan Mach, two clusters of date trees, and a good spring of water (leaches in pool below spring). About 12 miles Bahui kalag is seen one mile to left. More ups and downs over kaurs large and small, inclinings to E. N. E., to about 18 miles Zark-i-Khan Kaur, in which, at about 18j miles, is a small' pool of water, muddy but said to be sweet. Climbing the left bank of the kaur the track comes, 19 miles, to a disused kdres of the same name and turns a little S. of E. over a bare dan. From 20 miles on several tracks leading down towards the Mashkel are crossed, and at 21|- miles the Bandi Daf Kaur is entered and the track turns to the left up it. Like several other kaurs near here this kaur bifurcates one branch joining the Kuhak Kaur close to the grove, while the other pursues an independent course. From the bifurcation the track passes through the grove to camp. ROUTE No. 4. From ISPIKAN to DIZAK via the SHAHRI KAUR AND SIB. 149 miles. 12 Stages. Authorities. —Showers, Grant, Merriman, 1901 ; Tighe Orton, 1902 ; Makran Mission, 1916. Epitome. —As far as Sib this must be considered as a fair weather route With the rivers in flood, stage 1 and part otRoute No. k—contd. stage 4, in the bed of the Nihing, and the whole of stages 5 and 6 and probably also of stages 7 to 9 in the bed of the Shahri Kaur and its tributaries, would be impassable. After heavy rain stage 2 would be impracticable for several days. The crossing of the Mashkel in stage 10 would also be difficult if the river were in flood. The bed of the Shahri Kaur changes after each flood and The track is from time to time blocked by deep pools, round which a path has to be prepared at the expense of consider able delay. The route is hard on camels, but practicable for camel* transport and cavalry even in the hot weather. In many seasons scarcity of suitable grazing w r ould be an obstacle to the use of mule transport. As a route from Kech to Sib, that via Kalatak and Pur- chinan Daf (S. Bal. no. 86 and Routes III and IV(t)) is much to be preferred, being easier and shorter. Stages 1 to 6 of this route form part of the route from Kech to Irafshan, which is continued in Route IV(o). General direction N. For the first march the road follows the course of the Nihing river; the next three are through side valleys, a long diversion to avoid impassable rapids in the Nihing ; the last 2| miles of stage 4 are again in the bed of the Nihing ; stages 5 and 6 in the bed of its tributary the Shahri Kaur ; from 7 the path follows a tributary of the latter, the 'Bum Gwaz Kaur.' In stage 9 it enters the drainage system of the Mashkel river, which is crossed in stage 10. Stage 10 is prac ticable for wheels, and with a little preparation, for motor trans port. Stages 11 and 12 are good going throughout though the ascent of the pass in stage 11 and the descent into the Darag Rahi Kaur in stage 12 would present some difficulties to wheels. The road crosses an open stony plain for 6 miles then up stony ndlds to an easy pass, then over low ridges into the valley of the Surandar stream, and over the Lak Bulanden pass into the Darag Rahi valley, which leads into that of Dizak. Picquetting necessary throughout as far as Sib and some what difficult. Between Sib and Dizak it is desirable at Apatan, the ascent of the first pass and in the Darag Rahi valley; flank guards sufficient elsewhere.22S Route No. 4— contd.

De scend into bed of Kihing and cross to right bank. 31 miles, recross river. 4 miles, cross river again, and follow its course through a gorge to camp at a point where the Hamzai Kaur from the W. and the Shef-i-Chahar Daf Kaur from the N.-W. join the Nihing. The last three miles are in the bed of the river ; very rough at all times, they would be impassable for many days after a heavy flood. Driftwood lies in the gorge full}’ 40 feet above the ordinary level of the river.Route No. 4 — contd. Although this stage is very short, it is hard on camels, and unless the animals were in hard condition it would be unwise to attempt to press on even as far as Malik-i-Kalir. The Hamzai Kaur is the Official boundary between British Mekran and Persia. The boundary is continued to the N. E. by the Nihing itself. The old camping ground has been washed away by a flood and several small and scattered patches of fairly level ground have to be used, most of which are in Persian territory. A more compact camp on roughish ground could be made on the left bank of the Nihing a short distance above the junc tion of the streams. A cave in the left bank, a few hundred yards below the junction, gives pleasant shelter for a few men during the heat of the day. It is known as Mazar Hond. If trouble were apprehended four strong piquets would be needed. Water. —Abundant. {N.B—There are crocodiles in many of the pools.) Fuel .—Can be collected.

As far as 9 miles, where the stream issues from the ground, a good deal of running water (June 1916). 9| miles, the valley • widens and the path passes through jungle of tamarisk and other trees and reach grass. Steep ascent of l mile to summit of kotal and a short sharp descent, followed by an easy gradient for \ mile. Ilf miles another low kutal, a few yards steep. The path becomes more stony and at V2\ miles crosses a low ridge and then follows a stream to 14 miles, Malik-i-Kalir. Here 3 streams join and the track turns sharp to the N.-E. for a few hundred yards through the tangi of the Siah Kaur over rocks. Several more sharp turns till at 15J miles the bed of the stream becomes more sandy and the hills on either side lower. 17 miles, leave the kaur and wind among low hills. 18 miles, one track goes straight on to Jatani and the other inclines to the right to230 Rouxfi No. 4— contd.

The few huts which compose the village are a short distance down, most picturesquely situated among a series of fine “ Ghabrbands,'’'’ overhanging a deep valley. The people of Hung with their Motabir, Qadir Dad, are very friendly. Camping ground. —Unlimited. Water .—Abundant. A good pool for bathing. FveJ. —Plentiful. Fodder. —Camel-grazing—very good ; grass for horses— scanty. Supplies. —Small quantities of milk ; dates and jowari in the season ; sheep and goats in plenty; other supplies nil. There is a good but rather contracted camping ground at Malik-i-Kalir. Water from pools, sufficient for 500 men and 1,000 animals ; grazing and grass abundant; no other supplies. Note (6).—The direct road does not go into Hung but passes to the west of the Hung Gar through Jatani (apparently the place formerly known as Kirpasi a name not now in use) where there is a good camping ground with abundant grazing and grass. The supply of water from the Jatani Kaur (pools) is however insufficient for any but a small party.

No attempt should be made to pass through the gorge with laden camels at night unless the track has been ex amined in advance. It is almost choked with rocks and thick patches of grasses and would be impracticable in the dark if not cleared, which could however be done by 50 men in 2 hours. It would probably be convenient to camp at Lerawani Rahi, on the banks of the main kaur, where space is sufficient though the ground is stony.

General direction N.-W. _ (2,200'). This part of the route t 59 must be reconnoitred oefore the march is begun. Every flood in the river changes the position and nature of the difficulties, which are due chiefly to pools of water collecting at the numerous points where the stream bursts through walls of rock. It is practically im possible to get trustworthy information from the inhabitants even if any such are met. From camp the valley goes W. between walls of rock : the gorge is filled by deep pools which have to be turned by climbing the ridge to the north of the valley. The ascent is steep and hardly possible for heavily laden camels: it has been improved by the construction of regular zigzags but these may be destroyed by rain. From the highest point, almost directly above camp, the tract de scends and passes along a rocky plateau 30 feet above the stream. Above the upper pool the valley turns sharp to N.- N.-E. and the path descends to it (1 mile) on a wall built along a face of rock, the construction of which took four days (July233 Route No. 4— contd. 1916). The wall contained 2,500 cubic feet of stone, but it is not probable that it will be kept in repair. Cross the stream at a sharp turn (which might be a dangerous point) and mount on to a stony plateau on its right bank l^ miles. Along this for li miles and descend again into bed of stream above another large pool. At 3 miles the Jauran Kaur comes in from the west. Opposite it is a stretch of level ground, suitable for a camp—water, grazing, grass and fuel m plenty. Con tinuing up the bed of the Shahii Kaur about 5| miles another pool between high rocks one of which projects far into the pool. A little blasting and a good deal of filling up were necessary (1916) before camels could pass. 8 miles, Sohrab, a series of pools, one at least perennial.

Continue up bed of Shahrl Kaur, very rough and stony. This march is parti cularly hard in the hot weather on the camels’ feet because the stream has to be crossed repeatedly and when wet feet are placed on hot stones the pads tend to crack. At 4 miles the valley is shut in on both sides by a range of hills through which it 'bursts. This place might easily be obstructed. At 6 miles the pool of Bibi Hunar which is nearly divided into two by a similar range of hills. .The water was nine feet deep (July 1916) and a diversion had to be made (an hour’s work for 50 men) up a steep bank (50 feet) on the S. W. side, across a small plateau and down a nala into the river bed again. About 8 miles a rough ascent to the left into what appeared to be a high flood bed of the stream ; above this the valley- narrows considerably.

A mile further a hilal is reached front where an extensive view over the Sib, Magas and Dizak country is obtained. The hrfal lies on the watershed between the Shahrl Kaur and Mashkel rivers. The track next traverses a fairly open plateau with low hills here and there. There is a gentle and almost imperceptible descent to the open plain. Kant is a prosperous village nestling among date groves, between a low ridge through which the Kanti Kaur breaks on its way north to join the Mashkel, and a .small hill crowned by a fort rebuilt by Mir Ghulam Rasul of Sib to whom the Kant dis trict belongs. The fort is well loop-holed on all sides ; strong against rifle fire, but easily destroyed by guns. The village surrounds it, making dead ground.

The rest of the way is very rough crossing a series of hills. Murtan is on the Grawan Kaur, a tributary of the Bahu river. It is under Irafshan and has two palm groves, each about 500 yards long, and a small fort, on the south bank of the kaur, on a mound 75 fret high; en trance at the S. E. corner. The enclosure is of stone 40 yards square, and the walls of mud 5 foot high 1 feet thick, with a tower 12 feet in the S.-W. corner. The tower is loopholed but not the walls ; the latter are slightly broken down in places, but the position is strong against infantry. There is a well inside the enclosure. Inhabitants are reported to number about 100, in the cold weather, scattered in several small collection of huts, with as many more in the neighbouring _hills with their flocks. They are said to be of the Pongari and Askani tribes, and very poor. They weave camel hair and goat hair cloth and carpets, which they take, with their dates, to Gwadur, and exchange these for dried fish.

The fort of Irafshan, 40 yards square and 50 feet high with a wall inside, is not imposing in appearance : it is surrounded by mud huts and commanded by hills on all sides. Portions of it are (in 1916) falling into disrepair. It has belonged to the Baranzais for many years, and is now in the hands of Mir Ibrahim Khan, a close relative of Mir Bahram Khan of Bampur, a young man, with fanatical tendencies. The Irafshan ildqa is so completely encircled by hills that it is notorious as a refuge for badmashes from all round. A convenient camping ground lies a short distance below the village, between the groves and the hills bounding the valleys, but the water supply is exposed to pollution and flies and mosquitoes are troublesome.

The Magas fort is 145 yards by 75 yards ; the walls are of solid mud several feet thick; bastions at - the four corners: the upper battlements all loopholed tiers. On the N. is a moat; on the other side strongly built houses and small towers ; all loopholed ; the whole is surrounded by a high thick loopholed wall with good flank defences. Magas is the residence of Mir Shah Jahan, Kurd, the ruler of the Magas district, with the Persian title of Shuja-i-Nizam, and the head of the Kurds, of whom a branch is settled near Khwash and Sangun. He is an old gentleman of the most courtly Persian style, but has lost most of his power, and is overshadowed by the Baranzais and Buzurgzadas. There are very few Kurd families ; the majority of the population, about 250 houses in all, are Dehwars and various Baluch tribes, with the usual Naqibs. Several good date groves ; a large area of wheat cultivation, some barley, jowari and rice, beans and minor crops. A few small gardens with fruit trees ; the grapes are good. The village stands on a bare open plain, and the wind whistles down either side of the Kuh-i-Birg, the great and very steep mountain range which rises suddenly from the plain about five miles N. of Magas and stretches in a long line for 60 miles to the N.-W., without an easy pass in its whole length. Magas is therefore very cold in winter (minimum S'O 0 Farh. on 28th/29th November 1916), but much cooler than Sib in summer. About 300 donkeys can be collected in 3 or 4 days from the neighbourhood, but no camels. Camping grounds. —Unlimited. The best is S.-W. of the village, between the irrigated area and the river.

If the march is to be taken in 5 stages this would be a better halting place than the upper well, and the camp would be more easily protected. At 10| miles the upper Sur Chah well, which is also called Dambah Chah. It lies below two small hills which here contract the valley from E. and W. It is much used by graziers and a large area is nearly clear of vegetation. No inhabitants. Small piquets on five low hills on W., N., and E. sufficiently protect the camp.

Epitome.—This is the main route from Fehruj to the E. and N.-E. It is practicable, though on the watershed difficult, for wheeled artillery, and in 1902 the Persian Governor-General drove along it in a low phaeton carriage drawn by four ponies to meet Lieutenatit-Colonel Showers, in order to co-operate against outlaws on the Perso-Baluch border. The part of the road over the watershed in stage 4 gave him a lot of trouble, but could easily be put in order. From beyond Aptar in stage 1 to the watershed the track lies up, and generally in the bed of the Kunaro Kaur, with running water all the way from Kuh-i-Softeh ; as far as Aptar it crosses the Bampur plain, and beyond the watershed there is an easy descent into the Magas plain. Piquetting .—Would be required almost throughout the course of the Kunaro Kaur, and would frequently be slow, but ■seldom difficult.

Authorities. —Jennings, 1885 ; Grey, 1906 ; Hopkins 1912-13. Epitome .—This is the most direct route between Robat and Bampur, and is the one used by the few caravans that travel between these places. It is used both in summer and in winter. In its present condition it is only fit for pack trans port. From Chamgh the first half of the route is over fairly level ground, and is passable for wheels in its present state.. The next 22 miles are through hills the track following the beds of small hill torrents. In this section considerable labour would be required to make a road passable for wheels. The last five marches 86J miles are generally over fairly level ground, and very little labour would be necessary to render this portion a good road for wheels. The character of the soil is hard black gravel in the plains, and generally soft easily-worked shale in the hills. The water-courses usually have bottoms of firm coarse sand and clay. Stages 3 and 4 are fit for motors. Climate .—The climate in Sarhad is generally mild through out the year, and the route is passable for European troops at all seasons. The summer lasts from the beginning of June to the end of September. No excessive heat is experienced between these dates, and no rain falls. Night marching is unnecessary. From the end of October to the end of December the weather is delightful, but cold at night, and this is the most suitable time for the movement of troops. From January to April the weather is cold, and heavy rain usually falls. Snow storms are not uncommon, but the snow seldom lies for more than a few hours. From April to June the weather is mild and usually dry. This season is also suited for the move ment of troops. Transport .—Camels only are used for transport purposes on this route. About 200 of these could be collected at the occasional Baluch encampments passed en route. To the E. of the route, in the more fertile parts of Sarhad, however, large numbers are said to exist. Prices vary from 20 to 30 tumdns per head, according to age, size and sex. The camels are gene- 9 A254 Route No. 7— zontd. rally of light build and usually incapable of carrying a heavier load than from 240 to 320 lbs. They march on an average 15 miles per diem without halts. All the camels of these parts are capable of going up to two days without water, even in the hot weather. They are grazed only, no grain nor bhusa being given. Physical obstacles. —Between miles 86 and 108 the track leads through low hills, and considerable labour would be neces sary to render this section fit for wheels. No labour is obtain- ' able en route. Many small waterways are crossed, but these are never impassable for more than a few hours after rain. Miscellaneous.—TYie inhabitants all carry arms, all the trading men having modern rifles, and the others smooth-bore muzzle-loading rifles, pistols of local manufacture, and swords. The empty cases of ammunition are re-loaded locally with lead bullets. Alternative routes. —An alternative route exists via Jauri and Fahreh but this appears *to have no advantages over the present route. It is longer and dangerous to camels on account of the oleander, (Baluch Jaur), which abounds in the hills through which the route runs. Alternative stages. —The long march from Manzilaf to Dehak may be divided by making a halt at Harneh where however the water is limited in quantity. Water. —Water is abundant at stages 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 11. It is scarce to all the other stages. At stages 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 the water is brackish and has a strong purging effect on both men and animals during the hot months. During, and for a few months after, the rainy season, the water is said to be better in quality and more abundant. Fuel. —Abundant throughout, chiefly tamarisk, tagaz, and small bushes, with babul and kikvr in the low country near Bampur. Fodder. —Camel grazing is unlimited and excellent through out. Grass grows in abundance on all the plains and in most of the ndld beds, large supplies could be collected and stacked at the stages. Hopkins reports abundant grass S. of Shurab in April 1912, but practically none in Sarhad except a thin sprinkling on the plain of no grazing value ; whilst Robat is a barren desert255 n ? a kavia naTeiagelj these pan! i even in 4 ihm !)«! 08 theted 'uld be nett- )ur is obtais.

At 11 miles the road enters and follows the broad shingly bed of the Rudkhaneh-i-Jikuli, where the going is excellent. It .then avoids the stony ground near Manzilaf and proceeds along the centre of the valley. The stage throughout is practicable for all arms, and camp is reached at 15J miles.

At this point the valley is just about two miles broad. From Harneh there is an easy ascent through a gradually narrowing valley until at 14 miles the highest point (5,938 feet) is reached. At 18^ miles a large gravel yard, 800 yards to the left is passed, known as the Qabaristan-i-Gangu, the high tombstones of which form a good landmark. For the next mile the track leads over hard gravel, gradually descending. At l9| miles the bed of the Rudkhaneh-i-Galchah is entered. At 24 miles the wells of Galchah are parsed on the right of the track. If no water be found in the wells, about 15 minutes digging would probably be sufficient to find water. There is good grass, grazing and fuel. A quarter of a mile further on, a low spur is crossed, and at 29 miles a second spur is crossed. Half a mile further Dukdau spring is reached; water plentiful and fairly good ; grazing and grass abundant- The remainder of the track leads due S. over a gravelly plain overgrown with small bushes, camel thorn and occasional patches of grass.

At 1| miles the ruined fort of Kaleh- i-Bid is situated to the W. of the track. The latter continues across the plateau where there is both grass and perennial water. An unlimited supply of the former might be collected and stacked there. At 4£ miles is Chah Ahmad perennial running water in the stream, good grazing and grass; numerous livestock procurable. (Kirbas Kuh bears 119 degrees from Chah Ahmad and is 25 to 30 miles distant.) The track continues over a plain of hard gravel, reaching un dulating ground at 10 miles. At 121 miles is Shandak. Further on is a steep descent of 50 yards into the river bed. At 12^- miles the track leaves the river bed and follows an easy ascent up a ndld. Some 50 yards from the junction of the ndld with the river bed is Zaptak, a spring of brackish water. The Dar- gadin pass is reached at 14J miles. From here the track runs down a small ndld and enters another ndld running W. following this by an easy ascent for 2| miles till the pass known as the Gudr-i-Padagi is reached. The track thence continues down the Padagi ndld where the going is good and Padagi is reached at 19J miles. Water .—Brackish from small spring. Fuel. —Abundant. Fodder .—Good grazing.

Another J mile further on a small spring of water is passed known as the Tank-i-Paran, after which the track leads N.-W. up the bed of a narrow torrent, a tributary of the Padagi ndld, and crosses a hutal known as the Gudr-i-Mian Bazar. For the first 2| miles after leaving Padagi considerable widening of the track and levelling would be required for the passage of wheels. Five hundred men with pick and shovel could make it fit in one day. At 2| miles the road leaves the hills by a steep descent of 100258 Route No. 7 — contd. yards and enters the valley of the Mian Bazar. The first part of the valley is from two to four miles broad, narrowing further on to between 200 and 400 yards while for the last five miles it varies from half a mile to a mile. The track then leads due S. down the Mian Bazaar nala where the going is good over hard sand and shingle. During the last half mile there is a sharp descent of 150 feet. The track is here difficult for camels and a lot of spade work would be required to make it fit for wheels. Water.

Thence there .follow's an easy ascent over undulating ground until at 8J miles the highest point (5,217 feet) is reached. There is then an easy descent over a low spur to mile 10. The track is now close under the Siah-Kuh range which lies from a half to two miles to the E. The remainder of the road runs over level hard ground. A little pick and shovel work would be required at several points in the march. 100 men could make it passable for wheels in one day. Camping ground. —Should be chosen in the centre of the valley at a place where water could be brought down by develop ing a channel at Shurab from existing wells at the present halting place.

Further north the plain narrows and becomes a valley up which the road runs until at mile 16 the highest point is reached. Here the valley is 5 miles wide, and covered with tdgaz. From here the track works down through intricate hill country and passes the Bazman village lying under the first range of Bazman foot hills. The track then leaves the foot hills by a gap and enters a wide valley. This latter is reduced in width to J mile by low isolated lulls at mile 16J, but again widens out during the last stage of the route.

The going here is good over occasional shingle and sand. 1 he track then leaves the river bed and for the remainder of the journey continues over a rough open plain, which however is passable for wheels although stony. The march is passable for all arms throughout. Water. —There is no water at the halting place, it has to be brought from the Parag spring which is situated 2 miles to the E.

General direction S.-S.-E. For the 1931 first 7 miles the track leads over an open plain of hard gravel, after which it gradually ascends and leads over undulating ground until a ndld is entered. This is followed up for a mile, whence the road260 Route No. 7— contd. runs over rolling ground of hard gravel for f mile eventually working down a narrow and steep torrent bed for one mile until it reaches the Kaskin river. With the exception of the last mile the road is passable for all arms. Water .—Brackish water is obtained from pools in the river bed, which are generally much fouled by camels. Fuel .—In large quantities half a mile from the camping ground. Fodder .—Camel grazing and grass in large quantities half a mile from the camping ground. Supplies. — Nil. 11 BAMPUR .. 23J m. General direction S. The track first 221J follows the shingly bed of the Kaskin river, which it leaves at 2 miles by a steep ascent of 50 yards which would require ramping for wheels. At about 5J miles the broad dry bed of the Dabgazan river is crossed here, 1,000 yards wide with flush banks. The ground gradually descends over hard terrain sparsely grown with low bushes and occasional leikar, while the last 3J miles is over level ground and sand with leikar jungle.

Major Hopkins, R.E., 1912. Epitome.- This route with the exception of stage 3 is pass able for all arms. Ogilvie considers that stage 3 is impassable for guns, but King-W ood considers that a way could be found even for wheeled traffic. Hopkins reports that the route crosses intricate hills and ndlds, and is only suitable for small parties, who wish to get supplies at Bazman village. The route is usedKoute No. 8— contd. principally by local caravans coming from Khvash to Bam ; it is not the main caravan track between Bampur and Bam \yide Alternative Route (A)]. King-Wood thought this would be the best route for a telegraph line, and that it is better off in the way of supplies, water, grazing, climate, etc., and offers less difficulties than the other routes. Up to Chah Gaz (Stage 5) the road lies over rocky and stony ground, but, since the stones are not large, and the surface of the ground is fairly level, the construction of a cart road would not present any great difficulties. From here to Rigan the track lies over the plain on the borders of the desert, and the going is good. Climate .—Bampur is one of the most unhealthy places in Persia on account of its damp climate and sudden changes of temperature. In the section of the road between Bazman and Rigan the heat in summer is very great, and Ogilvie considers that any force of Europeans using the route at that season would be decimated. The climate in winter is good and snow .seldom falls. As a rule there is no snow between Rigan and Bam, but the climate in summer is hot and feverish. Physical obstacles .—The only obstacles are the stony places that have to be crossed in the first five stages, where the country is also cut up by small water channels. Stages for troops .—Some of the stages would be rather long for marching troops, but it would be found difficult to make intermediate halting places owing to the lack of water; how ever, in the rainy season, acting on local information obtained on the spot, it might be found possible. Water .—As far as Rigan water is obtainable from wells and the supply is, as a rule, sweet. Ogilvie traversed the route in June and reports that he found abundant water at all the halting places. Except at the halting places, however, water is not to be found, the country being an absolute desert, in habited only by nomads who own large flocks of sheep. From Rigan on water is abundant. Fuel .—Bushes for fuel are procurable at all the halting places. Fodder. —Camel-grazing is plentiful all along the route, and a certain amount of grass is to be found here and there. Supplies .—Supplies might be collected in very small quan tities at Bazman. Between the latter place and Rigan pr&amp;o262 Route No. 8— contd . tic ally nothing could be obtained with the exception, perhaps, of a few goats from the nomads who live along the borders of the desert. Alternative Routes. — {a) Bampur to Rigan, via Zahu. This is the direct route generally used by caravans. King-Wood says that it traverses a rougher country, and Ogilvie says that it is as difficult as the Bazman Route. (b) Bampur to Rigan via Giran Rig. Essentially a desert route. Seldom used. (c) An alternative route may be taken by leaving this route at Kahur (Stage 2), following Route 7 to Shurab, thence cross ing to Samsur (Stage 2, Route II (Z3). 20 miles, and following that route to Rigan. This alternative adds about 17 miles to the length of the route, but is, according to Hopkins, passable by all arms, and preferable for troops. No of stage and total distance.

The halting place is not on the track ; it is not, however, difficult to find as it lies in a very broad wdZd-bed. In the middle of the ndld is a single large acacia tree on the west of the road, while half a mile to the E. up the nald-bed lies a large clump of tamarisk bushes (which give the place its name, not Dabgiran, as printed in the maps). Camping ground .—Site for a camp 2 miles W. of the hills. Water .—Abundant and excellent. There are 6 wells in the ndld bed scattered over j mile. The water is said to be in exhaustible. Only one well is in use, and fit for drinking.. Others would require cleaning. Water is 10 feet below surface. A kdriz ought to be dug here easily, and should give good results.

Here Route 7 to the Talab valley bends slightly N.-E., and the well of Parag (stage 2 of that route) seems to be some 2 miles to the E. This route continues due N. Towards the end of the stage a very broad ndld, the Shandamulla, is crossed. This appears to be another name for the Talab river. It contains no water except after the rains. The track becomes stonier and rougher until the halting place is reached at 26 miles. The road is fit for artillery throughout. Water. —Abundant, but slightly brackish, from a large stream.

The track lies 47 among low hills and is in parts very stony and uneven. It is well-defined and lies generally some little distance from the left bank of the Kanur river. Bazman is a small village in a grove of date palms, inhabited by Kurds. The population consists of about 100 persons who live in matting huts. It is a most salubrious spot, cool in summer and warm in winter, and is situated in a hollow surrounded by low hills. The best place for a camping-ground is the extreme N. of the village in the date grove which contains the hot and cold springs. For a description of Bazman £ee Route II («), stage 5. 4 PANSAREH .. 14 m. General direction N.-N.-W. The first 61 eight miles of the stage are identical with Route II {u). At 8 miles, the track branches off to the N. and follows the bed of a sandy ndld which gradually swings round to the W. At 10 miles, again turning N., it leaves the n«?a(Rud-i-Zuhan), which higher up contains a little water, and from this point up to the halting264 Koute No. 8— contd. place winds in and out among a perfect labyrinth of hills, pre serving a generally northerly direction. It is quite impossible to describe the road among these hills with any accuracy, but the track, though quite impassable for anything but mountain guns, is well-defined and continually turns and twists ; now crossing a low kutcd and now descending into a deep ndld. There are three small patches of green near it, which give promise of water very near to the surface. Pansareh is a small strip of cultivation which is owned by the Sardar of Bazman. It contains a small grove of date palm, and is situated in a valley under the Kuh-i-Bazman, facing N.-E., which opens out on its easterly end on to the desert which divides the Siah Band and the Bazman Ranges. The best camping-ground is near the springs and is some what limited. Water. —Excellent from springs, but is full of leeches. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder. —Camel-grazing plentiful, grass scarce. Supplies. —Practically nil. 5 HANJlRA .. 28 m. General direction N. - W. Leaving 89 Pansareh the track emerges from the valley at 1 mile on to the desert which divides the Siah Band and Bazman Ranges ; the direction followed is N.-E. until the track is well between the two ranges, when it begins to swing round almost imperceptibly to the N., following a line parallel to the two ranges. The track is quite smooth, though the plain over which it passes is very stony. At about 10 miles it takes a nortn-westerly direction, and, always keeping the Bazman Mountain on the left, makes for the two hills, which form the northern extremity of the Bazman Range. At 24 miles the track enters a gap in these hills and goes up a sandy nala due W., which direction is maintained through the hills, until at 28 miles the Hanjira spring is reached. This lies in a rocky cleft under a bare hill facing N. The camping- ground is very limited and rocky near the springs. Water.'

After leav- 98 ing Hanjira the track goes N.-W. along the foot of the rocky hills in which Hanjira is situated, till at IJ miles, this small range is left be hind. The track up to this point is very rough and stony, but when this point is passed it becomes smooth and easy. It continues through the low foot hills which form the northern extremity of the Bazman Range to 5 miles, when turning W., the Bazman Range is finally quitted and the track strikes out into the open desert. Henceforth the ground is very undulating and covered with stones and a scanty growth of low shrubs. At 9 miles Chah Gaz is reached, a well in the open plain, about two miles N. of a low range of red sandstone hills. The camping-ground is unlimited. Water .—Fair and plentiful from a well. It is clean as it is constantly used by the Baluch nomads, who graze their flocks in the vicinity. Fuel. —Obtainable in small quantity. Fodder. —Camel-grazing can be obtained without great difficulty, but is not plentiful. Grass practically nil. Supplies. — Nil, as there are no permanent inhabitants ; a few sheep and goats might perhaps be purchased from the nomads. 17 RAMKAN .. 16 m. General direction W. The track leads in IH4 an absolutely straight line across the flat desert. At 1 mile the old well of Chah Gaz is passed, surrounded by tamarisks. The water in it has dried up. At 10 miles, the Kuh-i-Zahian, and at 12 miles the Kuh-i-Hamzahian, are passed. These are the two pro minent hills which lie side by side a short distance to the N. of the track. At 13 miles, the track passes between two low hills and makes for a range of hillocks which is crossed by a low Jcutal at 15J miles. Hence there is a gentle descent leading down to the well at Ramkan, which lies in the bed of a sandy nald. This place is much frequented by Baluch nomads who graze their flocks in the vicinity. The road throughout is smooth and free from stones. The camping-ground is limited.266 , Route No. 8— contd. Water. —Good and abundant from a well in the bed of the ndld. Fuel. —Plentiful.

At 4 miles, a perfectly flat treeless plain is entered, covered with small black stones. This continues to 14 miles ; from this point low shrubs again make their appearance, and at 17 miles, the broad, but very ill-defined bed of the Rud-i-Kunarnai is entered. At 19 miles the track enters very thi'ck tamarisk jungle. There are also a large number of kdhur trees dotted about in all direc tions, and indications of ancient kdrizes. At 20 miles, the Chah-i-Malik wells are passed. These contain a little brackish water, but are in a bad state of repair and would have to be dug out before any large quantity of water could be obtained from them. There is no water now at Chah-i-Malik, but about half a mile to the N. of the track is a good qandt, which, however, might be difficult to strike without a guide. From here onwards the track is very sandy and proceeds through a wilderness of small tamarisk shrubs, till at 24 miles, the smallRoute No. 8— contd . village of Dashtabad Mustafa, the first of the Narmashir villages, is reached. Here is a little cultivation irrigated by a kariz of excellent and abundant water. The camping-ground is unlimited, although the jungle would have to be cleared for a large camp.

The 1311 route lies in a valley some four miles wide, with a range of low hills to the left, three miles off, and disconnected hills on the right. This river-b , the Ramkan stream, seldom has water in it; the flood hmit^268 Route No. 8— contd. however, is 75 yards broad. A thick copse of tamarisk is passed at If miles close on the left. The road emerges from the Ramkan river-bed at miles on to a sandy plain, and at 4J miles there is small hill about a quarter of a mile on the left of the road. This plain, which continues to 7-J miles, is covered with good camel-grazing, but from 5 to 6-jf miles it is strewn with a kind of cindery stone of a red-black and grey colour. From the end of the plain to 9f miles the track leads over slightly undulating ground and across a plateau. Here another large plain is entered, which is also covered with good oamel-grazing. At Ilf miles, a small, conical, volcanic-looking hill is passed, 200 yards to the left of the track, and at 12f miles some tama risks, also to the left. At 15f miles the plain comes to an end and the track emerges on to undulating ground after traversing a wet and salty depression, which is only 90 to 100 yards wide, and which could be avoided by a slight detour. At 16f miles a low ridge is crossed and the track comes out to another plain. At 17J miles the Tal-i-Nukabad is passed, some 150 yards to the right of the track. At 17f miles, the halting place of Nukabad is reached. It lies some 8 miles N. of Gehgan. Water .—From a well of slightly brackish water, seven feet deep. Fuel. —Scarce. Fodder. —Camel-grazing fair.

About half a mile further there is a line of stones covering about an acre in rectangular shape, and known as the Mazar, is passed. At 2 miles, a small oblong flat topped hill is passed about 50 yards to the right of the road, and is known as the Tal-i-’AlI Badgir. At 2f miles a ndld is crossed in which there is a rich growth of reeds and grazing, and some springs of very brackish water. At 3f miles another nald is crossed. Thence the road descends a stony bare barren plain with a few undulations in places. At 9f miles many small channels have to be crossed as far as lOf miles. In this strip of about a mile, there is an abundant growth of tamarisk andRoute No. 8— contd. excellent grazing for camels. The track then lies over a gravelly plain to the halting place at Chah-i-Malik, at Ilf miles, where there are a few mimosa trees. The well is just beyond the eastern verge of the Narmashlr District. This place is reached at mile 20 of Stage 9 of the main route. ALTERNATIVE ROUTE (A). Fkom BAMPUR to RIGAN via ZAHU. 160 miles. 9 Stages. Authorities. —Jennings, 1883 ; Goldsmid ; 1906. Epitome .—This is the main caravan route between Bampur and Bam. It is shorter, more direct, and less stony than the route via Giran Rig. It would be passable for guns with some difficulty, but there are no supplies and water is liable at some of the stages to be scarce, and at all the stages except two is more or less brackish. From Bampur to a point eight miles north of Gazak (60 miles in all), the road is so smooth and free from stones that motor cars might almost be driven over it. Between Bampur and Kuch Gardan (stage 1) and a little beyond this place it lies through thick tagaz jungle. _It enters the hilly country to the west of the Kuh-i-Bazman, eight miles north of Gazak, and from this point until the beginning of the Dasht-i-Tagaz is reached (a distance of about 36 miles) it is simply abominable. The track here lies along the beds o* torrents full of boulders and is terribly cut up by ravines. There is a constant ascent and descent over stony Jdvtals. From the Dasht-i-Tagaz to Gehgan (32 miles) the road is flat but strewn with small jagged stones. From Gehgan to Rigan it is smooth and free from stones. Climate .—The winter (i.e., the months of January, February and March) is extremely cold. The heat in the summer is simply terrific. In December the temperature is about the same as that of the end of September in the Punjab. The nights, however, are inclined to be cold. Rain falls in the months of January, February and March, but the fall is scanty and uncertain. The remainder of the year no rain falls.270 Route No. 8— contd. Miscellaneous .—A guide is absolutely essential for travellers unacquainted with the route. There are numberless tracks- branching off in all directions. These are used by the nomads and as they are all exactly similar to the main track it would be very easy to lose one’s way. Water .—Abundant at all stages except 2 and 6 where it is scanty and uncertain. Fuel .—Obtainable in abundance everywhere except at Zahu and Gehgan, where nothing larger than dry twigs can be gathered. Fodder .-—There is abundant camel-grazing everywhere. Supplies .—There are no supplies on the road. The only permanently inhabited places are Kuch Gardan and Gazak. The road is, however, much frequented by nomads who own enormous flocks and herds.

For the first 3| miles, 17 the route lies through continuous cultivation, at a short distance from the right bank of the Bampur River. At 5 miles, the road to Geh branches off on the left. From this on, the track winds about consider ably through a dense jungle of kahur and tamarisk trees, over soft sandy going which is cut up by water channels. At miles is the ford over the river to Qasimabad on the southern bank, where there is a long strip of cultivation. The road now runs close to the river with high sandhills on the right. At 11 miles, the Gazaki Kaur is crossed, and at 13 miles is Khushab hamlet on the left, and on the other side of the river, the tiny village of Sardu. At 16 miles, the Sirta Kaur is crossed, and opposite to this point, on the other side of the river, is Tatri, a small hamlet. Kuch Gardan is reached at 17 miles ; here is a very large clearing in the jungle, and cultivation. Further north is a sand desert. The river here is some fifty to eighty yards wide, with a muddy, sandy bed, 100 to 150'yards wide with low shelving banks.Route No. 8 — contd.

At 13| miles the Dar-i-Ahu halting place is reached, where water and grass are abundant. At 14J miles there is another excellent halting place. Darreh Duzab is reached at 15J miles, which is also a good halting place. The going; throughout the stage, is abominable, over stones and boulders most of the way.

The road as- llOf cends up a valley, which requires clearing of stones as far as the first Jcutal of the Dar-i-Ahu, at 4J miles ; the second kutal is reached at 5 miles,, both are easy, but the road requires repairs after floods, and several ndlds would require brushwood to be laid across them in order to permit of the passage of guns. Thence there is a gradual ascent to a watershed at 7J miles, from which the road descends, sometimes following the bed of the Shandak ndld, and sometimes parallel to it over an open stony plain known as the Dasht-i-Tagaz. At 17 miles, the Chah-i-Qurban is passed, one and a half miles to the left, where perennial brackish water is obtainable. At 24 miles, the Shandak ndld is crossed, parallel to which the road has been running since crossing the Tcutal, and is descended to Zahu. Until the Dasht-i-Tagaz is reached the going is very stony. Water .—Immediately after summer a very scanty supply of sweet water from a number of rough wells, about 15 feet deep in the sand. In the early winter (i.e., in December), it is liable to dry up altogether, though this seldom happens. In any case, more can be obtained by a little digging, as the ground, 15 feet below the surface, is always damp. Fuel .—Nothing larger than twigs, fuel must be brought from the Dasht-i-Tagaz, a few miles back.274 Route No. 8— contd. Fodder. —Camel-grazing plentiful, grass very scarce.

E., up the bed 28 of the BIr River 100 yards wide between high sandstone cliffs, good going over sand and gravel. At m. 6 the track from Chaplnl enters down a steep gorge on the left bank of the river. Note. —Chaplnl is N.-W. of Kair (Route VII(a)) and 16 m. from it. The road leaves that Route at Kair and crosses a sandy plain and later leads through fields and jungle. It approaches within 3 m. of the sandstone hills to the N. -when Chapini is reached. After Chapini the general direction is still N.-W. The track leads over a level plain or cultivated fields of wheat or cotton for one mile till shm and sandstonk hills are reached. Proceed up a stony nala to 3 m. from Chapini where a track from Saran joins from the S.-S.-E. At 3£ m. the road bifurcates one path • loading over the Ghariba Kutal and the other over the Sotkag (Suptak ?). Both are steep and stony rising to a height of 600 feet above sea level with a steep descent to the BIr river on the W. The Ghariba is the shorter route but the sand stone is very soft and forms precipices 100—300 feet in height on each side of the road.Route No. 9— contd. The bed of the BIr river is covered with Icahur and tamarisk trees. In March there is plenty of running water, but at other times the amount is scanty. The direction of the road is now N. as far as m. 8J, then W. for a mile, after which N.-N.-E. to m. 11J. The going is good. At 12 m. a zldrat is reached. Camping ground. —The hills open out and there is camping ground for a brigade. Water .—Pools of good drinking water are available, or in summer shallow wells of brackish water in sandy river bed. Fuel. —There is a heavy Izahur jungle. 3 KtJANZ RIVER 10 m. General direction N. N.-W. Continuing 38 up the ndld bed, good going over gravel. At m. 14 the track ascends to a gravel plain, through which the river seems to cut like a trench. At 19J m. the Kuanz river is reached, at an elevation of 500'. This river, which, lower down, is known as the Bandini, is here 410 yards broad, and has a sandy bottom. It is about 3' deep. Water. —Rather brackish from pool in river-bed. This dries up in summer, when water can be obtained from brackish -and shallow wells in river-bed. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder.—Cood. grass, and grazing for camels. Supplies. — Nil. 4 ZANGlN (MUR- 10 m.

After passing 60 a small date-grove several shallow ndlds are crossed containing pools of brackish water. A gradual ascent is then made through shur hills, till .-at 51 m. an elevation of 600 feet is reached. To the N.-E.280 Koute No. 9— contd. lies a high range of sandstone mountains. The path ^ then descends to the Rapsch river at m. 7, the bed of which is here half a mile wide. The hamlet of Trati, consisting of 10 huts and few wheat-fields, is passed half a mile, further on, situated on the left bank of the river. The track follows the left bank of the Rapsch river, till at m. 9 it joins the river bed Situated on the right bank is another small hamlet with a few dates and cultivated fields. The width of the river is here 600 yards, but half a mile higher up low hills approach on both banks, and its width is reduced to 300 yards. The road continues up the bed of the river to Kurandab, which is situated half a mile above the junction of the Bint river with the Rapach, which is also joined by another large tributary from 'NT.-E. Kurandab consists of 6 Baluch huts and a date grove. Water .—Good and plentiful. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder. Grazing good for camels, and in March there is luxuriant clover. Supplies. —Some wheat and bean fields. 6 BINT • • 20 m. Track leaves the river by a small pass g0 through low hills on the right bank of the Rapch, here known as the Bint river. After winding through low hills for miles the river is again reached and the road crosses to the left bank over a mile of shingle and up on to and along a low plateau for another 2 miles flanked by low hills to the N.-E. At 6| miles the track again crosses to the right bank through miles of tamarisk jungle and shingle. At 8 miles leave the river bed and cross through a pass 0 between low hills for 2b miles and over another mile of shingle to the first palm groves of Bint on the left bank at 11J miles. From this point the road follows the left bank past scattered palm groves. At 14 miles the first hamlet is reached, with cultivation from irrigation channels. At 15 miles a mass of jagged peaks forming an isolated hill is reached and Sipurg comes into full view. The road continues along the river bed from which numerous irrigation channels take off the water to the fields, which are surrounded by fringes of palm trees.Route No. 9— contd. Sipurg, a conical hill of reddish-white rock, is four miles further on, and the date groves in which the town is situated lie immediately under this hill which encloses it on the N.-E., N., and N.-W. sides. See Route VII {d), stage 3. 7 DISK .. 7 m. General direction N.- The track follows the 87 shingly bed of the Kaur-i-Bint. At 3 m. the large village and date grove of Dehan is passed. At 7 m. Disk.

The ndld is here bounded by low shaly ridges, running down to it at right angles. At 2 miles Tasap is reached (good camping ground and water), A small party camping here would be liable to be raided by the neighbouring Lashaiis, a wdld tribe of nomad Baluchis. The road now leaves the ndld and crosses a stony plain to Sartab at m. Here the road again enters the ndld. At9| m. Giri, a huge blood red rock with a pool beneath it. No village or supplies,_ merely a halting place by pools, Avhich are apt to be contaminated by kafileks. From here to 17 m. the road runs through the Fanuch tangi, a gorge out of which at almost every point it would be possible for men or mules to climb. The first part of the gorge is good going over sand and gravel; the last three miles of the way are strewn with marble boulders, among which camels have to pick their way slowly. The last mile of the gorge is narrow, the river bed not being more than 50 to 60 feet Avide in places ; there is, however, a vertical cliff on one side only. At 18 m. Fanuch.

Aimini River rises in the plains after rain, and winds into the Fanuch Pass, thence finding its way to the sea, under a new name, at Galag in W. Makran. . . , . n Fanuch is' a comparatively large and important village consisting of several mud huts. The fort is in ruins and seem- ingly uninhabited. In 1894 there were about 100 houses and probably 500 inhabitants, most of whom were said to be slaves.

Thence over a bare stony plain dotted with low hills up to a gently sloping kutal about 600 yards wide. This form a watershed, to the S. of which all water flows towards the sea. At 84 m. a well-defined track branches off towards Ramishk and at 9 m. a direct track from Maskhutan comes in from the S.-W. From the top of the kutal to Jugaz the path is indistinct and not easy to find Running down the W. branch of the Jugaz ndld the track goes over a narrow saddle between low but steep hills, down a short steep descent to the head of a ndld at 11 m.

The track continues very good, passable tor any traffic, and only occasionally crossed by shallow water courses. At about 9f miles the road goes through a sort of wide defile. At 13f miles the road crosses a large river-bed with scarped banks 10 feet high containing a considerable stream with good water. At 15 miles it enters the cultivated land of Karun, and at 16| miles passes through the village, a prosperous looking place, with a small fort and several adobe-built houses. At about 17| miles the road again leaves^the cultivation and enters a rather thick jungle of tamarisk, Kunar, etc. It is a somewhat difficult matter to continue in the right direction as the track disappears in the juiigle, and the village of Taling being merely a group of palm matting huts concealed in the jungle, is invisible until one is close upon it.

Taling on a bearing ot 14o across a level plain covered with a thin jungle of tamarisk, her, etc., and cultivated in patches among the trees. There is no track to speak of, but the general direction is south-westerly towards the right hand side of a range of bold rocky hills, some 400 feet high. At about 3J miles skirt the lower slopes of this range, over rocky ground with considerably less jungle. Shortly afterwards the track enters the bed of a shallow water-course, and low hills begin to rise on the right some 50 or 60 feet high' At 4| miles the water course forks, branches coming from right and left. The track here leaves the water-course ascending a gentle rise towards a low col, which is crossed at 5 miles. Just beyond it, on the right, are some ruins, said to be those of a village named Garak. At 7 miles a very broad and extremely stony river-bed, containing a good stream of water flowing from left to right. The road crosses it and leads up a narrow branch on the further side, enclosed between steep 20 feet banks, which it ascends \\ ith but few deviations as far as the 9th mile, the track being rather rough and stony; fairly good for pack annuals, but decidedly not passable by wheels in its present condition At 9 miles the channel goes off to the left, and the track crosses 10 A286 Route No. 10 — contd . two or three low undulations and then strikes another stream, flowtau pretty much in the same direction as the one just qurtted The” aC rf this stream is more defined. Steep cliHs abou 2^0 feet h£h rise 1 mile to the left, while on the r.ght are abrupt Sy hUlfataut half that height, and only a few hundred yards distant The cliffs on the left converge towards the road, tmtt about 11 miles the valley is only some 100 yards wide. This pohit is about the head of the stream, and almost mune- diately afterwards the track rises over another low saddle or water-shed, and comes out on to a very broken stony, and barren plain. At 13| miles the track is extremely bad nation, roTky and broken-for two or three hundred yards. At 16i m. the road crosses the Mazavi River and continues on its left bank, over a clayey and stony plain covered with thin i angle The track is level and good, except at the river whic has to be crossed three times before reaching the camp on the riaht bank at about 17J miles. .. j S IFoisr—The water of the Masavl, though sweet and good, is thick and white in colour ; this fact may be attnbuted to*e amount of gypsum which it contams in solution. 1 he same remark applies to almost all the smaller streams crossed during this march. Fuel, —There is plenty of fuel to be found in the river-bed. Fodder .—Good camel-grazing on the plain; a sort of coarse reedy grass grows in the stream which horses would eat in de fault of better forage. Supplies. — Nil. n f'Am . • 17 m. General direction S.- 5 E. At starting the 1 bearing of the road is 165°. For the first 4J miles it lies over an undulating stony plain, traversed by numerous dry shallow water-courses running down into the Mazavi, which continues on the right, about half a mile distant. To the left, about the same distance off, rises a line of perpendicular rocky cliffs, some 300 feet high. Stony rugged hills about 200 feet high lay beyond the river on the right. At 4| miles the road finally crosses and leaves the Ma2avi, continuing its course up a dry ravine which joined it an the further side. It now approaches a mass of rocky hills, and the country grows more and more broken and difficult.Route No. 10— contd . At 6 miles a considerable kutal is crossed. The ascent is fairly good, but the descent extremely steep and impracticable, ■down a slope of loose sliding shale into the bed of a every rocky ndld, which is in fact the same channel entered on quitting the Mazavi, which has made a wide sweep to the left. The track now ascends this ravine, v^hose bed is extremely rough and rocky. It is enclosed by steep, almost precipitous banks on ■either hand, those to the right being about 60 to 80 feet high, and those to the left, 40 to 50 feet. The track continues in this ravine to the 7th mile, where it begins to ascend to a high kutal known as the Garish Banu. The ascent has an incline of about 10°. The path is fairy good for animals, but too narrow for wheeled traffic. At a little over 9 miles the track crosses another low water-shed, and then enters a small rocky stream, whose channel it descends. The banks on either hand are sloping and stony and 50 to 60 feet high. At lOf miles the width of this little valley is about 200 yards, and a conspi cuous hill, 300 feet high, stands about a mile to the left. Shortly afterwards the stream goes off to the right, and after crossing a small intervening plain, descends a rocky slope to the bed of another considerable river, the Davari. It here makes a sharp curve, flowing off to the right. Crossing it, at the top of a steep 8 feet bank on the other side is a small cultivated plain, partly enclosed by the bed of the river. Crossing this, ascend slightly, and come to a level gravel plain with a thin jungle. The Davari runs on the left hand in a broad stony bed, with scarped banks 10 to 15 feet high. This plain is known as the Sahra-i- Gurg. In front can be seen t\vo bold masses of rocky cliffy hills. The Davari issues from between them, and at a little over 16 miles the track enters the gorge through which it comes 70 to 100 yards wide. The track here takes to the river-bed, which for a few hundred yards is extremely bad travelling, filled up with big, rounded, slippery boulders and deep pools of water. It is a difficult place for laden camels. The gorge is only about a quarter of a mile long, and the track leads out beyond on to an open cultivated plain, on which, at 17 miles, is the small village of Gani; a group of the usual palm-leaf huts. It stands on the left bank of the Davari, which runs in a broad rocky bed about 100 yards to the north. W ater. —Obtainable.288 Route No. 10 — contd. across the small cultivated valley towards a low ndgc of rocky hUls which bounds it on the south, and crosses it by a very rough and stony path. The next two nnles are a constant succession of steep ascents and descend over an extreme y rough and impracticable country. At 2 miles it rises over a considerable kutal, the last hundred yards on either side having a gradient of about 15°, with a rocky and a difficult track. Three quarters of a mile to the right is a conspicuous peak, about 300 feet high (above the level of the pass), called Sar-i-Darish. Th e descent is quite as bad as, or worse than, the ascent, and at 2J miles the bottom is reached, in the bed of a large dry water-course. This is followed to the 3rd mile, when another ascent begins, with a slope of 10°, towards the second kutal of any importance, whose crest is reached at 3f miles. This is also on a lower spur of. the Sar i-Darlsh hill, which is now only about 600 yards distant to the right. In fact the track circles round this hill, first leading south and then almost south-west as far as 4| miles, where it strikes the bed of a large river called the Bashiraz. Here the road turns to the right down the stream ; but only far about of a mile. At that distance it turns up a branch joining in on the left. This is also a large channel containing a good stream of water. Both these streams have extremely rocky beds filled with huge boulders. The banks are extremely steep and broken. The track continues to ascend the bed of the stream, sometimes in the actual stream itself sometimes along the stony and shingly mar gin. At its mouth, the left bank is 100 feet high, and precipi tous, and the opposite one about 60 feet, with steep rocky slopes. The heights of both banks increase further on. At 6f miles the left bank merges into.a precipitous rocky range 600 or 700 feet high, and f mile distant. At 7f miles the track turns to the right out of the channel which makes a wide detour to the left. It then crosses a small broken plain, some 2 miles wide, from the high rocky range which is 1J miles distant to the right, to some low banks, 50 feet high, which bound the further side of the river, half a mile to the left. At 9 miles the stream is again re-entered for a short distance, and finally quitted at 9| miles. It here band-i-kal- ACHtX 16| m. General direction S.- E.

From this point the track crosses nearly two miles of extremely rough and broken country, winding among rocky dry ravines to the 11th mile where it enters and ascends another considerable water-course, with a strong stream flowing in it.* Its left bank is a perpendicular scarp, about 10 feet high at first, but increasing to 200 feet in the course of 2 miles. The other bank is composed of steep rocky slopes, about 80 feet high. At 13J miles both banks are of the same nature—steep slope, ■about 100 feet high, rocky, and almost bare of vegetation. At 151- miles the track finally quits this channel, which goes up to the left, while the former ascends the right bank of the stream towards a high Jcutal, which is reached at 151 miles. The ascent is steep, the slope near the top being nearly 15°. Immediately on the other side the track strikes into a narrow rocky little channel containing a small trickle of water, which it descends as far as 16 f miles, at which point there is a little platform of earth on the right bank (which was once cultivated), on which grow two or three palms. It is appa rently partly artificial, its edge towards the stream being sup ported by a wall of rough stone. There are no dwellings, but the name of the place is Band-i-Kalachu.

As one proceeds the channel grows more and more rocky, and the banks change from steep slopes of gravel and decomposed rock to perpendicular scarps of rock—at least on the right bank. At about 5| miles the track quits this river-bed, which turns off to the right, and enters the bed of another which here joins it on the left. Route No. ViII (d) appears to keep to the river-bed just left. The track is everywhere extremely rough and broken, utterly impracticable for anything on wheels, and trying even for camels and horses. At about 7|- miles the left Bank is a perpendicular scarp about 100 feet high. Thence forward there is generally a scrap on one or the other bank, * It is believed that this stream is the one left at miles. *290 Route No. 10— contd . according as the river curves. At 11 miles the track quits the- river-bed rises over a small saddle, the channel being to the left. It rejoins it about f mile further on, and does not quit it again until the cultivation of Jaghdan is reached. A small open space on the right bank of the stream has been taken advantage of to form one of the sort of platforms which are commonly seen on these rivers. The village of Jaghdan lies a little back among the low hills on the opposite bank. It is the usual, miserable collection of wretched palm-matting huts. fi B AND-I-KALANG 19 m. General direction L. ‘ by S. The track jQgs leaves Jaghdan on a bearing of 70°, and for nearly a mile crosses a fairly level and open plain on the right bank of the river. At about 1 mile the track crosses the river, which now goes up to the left, and ascends a dry branch on its left bank. The channel at the crossing is about 250 yards wide, and full of shingle and boulders. The valley now followed is some 200 yards in width steep hills, about 300 feet high, on the right, and about 60 feet high to the left. The valley continues to- widen up to nearly 4 miles, at which point it is over half a mile wide, between abrupt rocky hills, 400 feet high, on the left, and similar, but rather lower elevations, on the right. These are connected by a low ridge, forming a water-shed, which is crossed about the 4th mile, by an easy gradient. Bey ond this the track descends into another important drainage channel. This at first forms a narrow ravine, with precipitous banks, 60 to 80 feet high on either hand; while the hills, 400' feet high, above mentioned, still continue on the left, about 500 yards distant. At about 2 miles from the water sheds or 6 miles from Jaghdan, the ravine opens out,, and become, a small valley, 400 yards wide. The bed of the stream is stony, containing a little water, and tufts of reeds and grass. The track runs sometimes on one bank and sometimes on the other, and sometimes in the channel itself. It is fairly good except at some of the crossings. At 9| miles a track goes off to the left, to Sardasht .* A little • Galindo says :—“ I believe that would have been my best road as at a former baiting place I had been told that on reaching Sardasht —the head of the plain— I should find level ground extending to Bint. But I allowed my two guides to' persuade me to take the right hand track which they said was nearer.” This »eems doubtful. _ ^291 Mkquitjth) ! to the feii l u &gt;t it again smai opa ® advaBtat; 'e conmonk a little bad is the iai 5. lirectioa L The trad Jaghdan m ses a faith the rim which mi Is left bant de, and M r ed is so® on the right continues I s over half i high, on 4 on the right a water-sM adienl Ber taut drak th precipita the hills, t 1 ' he left, ate e opens oil wide, ft le water, &amp; tetimeson® dn the chan- crossings. l j jroadasstilo®' esd ot tie Route No. 10—con'd. short of 12 miles the track quits the river-bed, which goes off to the left, and rises over undulating ground on the right bank of the river, towards a rather high kutal, which is crossed at 12^ miles. The gradient is about 8° ; and the path fairly good. Half a mile to the right is a conspicuous hill, about 300 feet high. The descent from the kutal is similar to the ascent, but more stony. At 13-| miles the track enters another dry stony ravine, and follows it down for about f mile when it leaves it and strikes across a small plain on the right bank. Shortly afterwards another low water-shed is crossed, and at 16£ miles the bed of another large drainage channel is reached. This is a tributary of the Jagin river. At lf)J- miles the camping- ground of Band-i-Kalang is reached on the banks of the river ; but there are neither dwellings nor cultivation. The river-bed here is some 200 yards wide, with a bed filled with coarse shingle and boulders. The banks consist of shale and gravel with steep slopes, frequently forming perpendicular scarps where cut away by a concave curve of the river. At such points there is generally a deep pool. Here and there in the bed of the stream are small islands of more sandy soil, which are overgrown with Tamarisk. The palmetto grows plentifully everywhere. Water .—Obtainable from pools in river.

Leaving Band-i- 121f Kalang, the track continues to follow the Shah Bawag river, sometimes in the actual channel, sometimes on one or the other bank. Three miles distant to the right is a rocky and precipitous range, 500 feet high. At 4§ miles this range comes to a termination, its end being then about f mile to the right. Here a well- Beaten track, turns off in that direction to Jask. It evidently skirts the corner of the above-mentioned range. The river here is about 100 yards away to the left of the track, which crosses a bit of fairly level plain. The river-bed now becomes of a wider and more open character, the precipitous banks on either hand being frequently 200 or 300 yards apart. As the track proceeds, the river-bed continues to open out, and it292 Route No. 10— contd. sometimes quits the river-bed for 2 or 3 miles at a stretch, crossing a tolerably level plain. The track continues to traverse country of this description up to 12i miles, where it finally quits the bed of the Jagin river, which goes off to the right. It now strikes into and ascends a branch stream which joins the Jagin on the left bank. It is very much narrower than the Jamn and contains less water. At 13J miles the track passes through a small isolated date-grove, and just beyond it passes over a low but somewhat steep col, the river-bed being on the left. The banks here are less rocky, being sloping and rounded and composed of clay and gravel. At about 15 miles, however, the river-bed resumes its rocky character, and here, in the angle formed by the junction of another small stream coming from the left, is situated the miserable little hamlet of Parman. It consists of a few wretched palm-leaf hovels, in a small date plantation. 8 GVAFAR .. 30J m. General direction E. ; ’ by S. The' track 152J continues up the bed of the stream on whose right bank Parman is situated. The channel is very winding and tortuous, the track rough and rocky, and the banks steep and precipitous, formed of a black slaty rock. At about 8| miles the track reaches the head of the stream, and just beyond crosses a low kutai, with gradients of about 10°. It then enters another small channel, which, however, is only followed for about half a mile and then ascends a small branch stream the right. At the junction there is a small palm-grove. A more undulating tract of country is now entered. About half a mile to the right is a range of rocky hills, some 300 feet high. There is now rather a rapid rise in the general level of the ground, and at 6f miles the crest of another considerable water-shed is reached. The ascent is about 10°, and the descent 15°. Thence it leads down a narrow rocky ravine, with steeply sloping sides, till at 8 miles it strikes into the bed of another considerable drainage channel, coming in from the left. At about 9f miles this channel is quitted, the track rising steeply over the left bank of which the slope is nearly 20° ; and then crosses a bit of undulating plain for some 5 furlongs, till it again enters the river-bed. From the top of the last Jcntal the great hill known as Guh Kuh comes in sight; it is an abrupt, square-shaped mass of rockRoute No. l§—contd. apparently of great height. At 13 miles the river-bed goes away to the right, and the track, which is a good one with a fairly gentle rise turns up small shallow valley on the further side. At 15 miles the crest of a Icutal is reached, the last 500 yards having a slope of about 12°. The descent is nearly 20° down a hillside composed of sandy clay and gravel. This inchne only lasts for some 200 or 300 yards, after which the slope is quite gentle, and at 15f miles the bed of another important drainage channel is entered, which is followed down wards. At 21 miles a point is reached where the river passes through a sort of gate between precipitous rocks 60 to 80 feet high on either hand. There is a steady, rise in elevation, and at 24 miles the crest of the water shed is reached, which forms a considerable Icutal. The path on the hither side is fairly good, and the slope fairly gentle ; but on descending it immediately plunges into a very narrow and rocky ravine, shut in on either side by great perpendicular cliffs, over 100 feet high. The track goes down this ravine for about a mile. The track here leads down a narrow rocky little stream that runs past the plantation on the side opposite to that where it enters it. Here the track becomes very difficult. The bed of the stream is too narrow and rocky to be passable by camels, and every available inch of level ground on the banks is laid out in small fields, fenced by stone walls, 3 to 4 feet high. After going 200 or 300 yards, the patches of cultivation cease, and the track leads along the left bank of the stream, but it still continues very bad. This stream apparently comes down direct from the flanks of Guh Kuh. At 26|- miles the stream is crossed, and then a steep kutal on the right bank, the crest of which is reached at 27 miles. The descent is very steep, rocky, and bad for another mile, at which distance the track again enters the bed of the stream, which makes a very wide detour to the left. Here the channel is 20 to 30 yards broad, fairly level, and bottomed with fine gravel. At about the 29th mile the channel is again quitted, and the track runs over a bit of level clayey plain partially culti vated on the left bank. It is bounded to the left by low gravel slopes. At about 30J miles the river-bed makes a sharp curve to the left, and the track comes out on to a wide open plain. Here the stream which the track previously descended, flows into another very large one which comes from the north, and294 Route No. 10— contd. the two having united flow oft to the eastward. The plain the track now crosses, forms a sort of delta or corner at the j unction of the two streams. This is crossed diagonally towards the bank of the larger one. The village of Gvafar lies among the low gravel hills to the west of the plain, some 1| to 2 miles off. It is only a group of a few palmetto-leaf huts. 9 MlR SHAHDAD 7 m. General direction N.- E. The track runs 157J down the bed of the river, which is here about 500 yards in width, with a smooth sandy bed, except just in the centre, where there is coarse shingle. After half a mile a reef of rock is reached, which has to be avoided by going up a sort of goat track on the steep bank to the left, which^amels can barely scramble up. On top of the bank is a mass of jagged ridges of rock. The track lies along a narrow V-shaped crevice between two beds of upturned strata. The descent at the end of this crevice into the river bed is extremely difficult for laden camels. Up to If miles the track continues in the bed of the stream, which is extremely bad going on account of its rocky nature. At about If miles the bed of the Gabrig river is quitted, the track rising over a steep and rocky bank on the right. At 3f miles the track descends into and crosses the river bed which has been on the right. The banks are low, and the stream broad and shallow at the ford ; but the bottom consists of transverse ridges of slippery rock. The track continues up this stream for about a furlong on the left bank, and then recrosses it by a similar ford ; in fact it simply cuts off a rather sharp elbow which the stream here makes. The track now runs along the right bank of the steam for nearly f of a mile, over a level gravelly plain, the track here being fairly good. At 4J miles the river is again crossed, this time by a rather bad cross- ing, the whole bed of the stream which is some 200 yards wide, being filled up with large rounded boulders. The opposite bank is sandy, and well grown over with tamarisk for about f- mile, beyond which the track rises on to higher gravelly ground and crosses a low and unimportant saddle^ The track continues along this bank to the 7th mile, where is situated the little hamlet of Mir Shahdad. It is the usual poverty stricken group of huts, built of palmetto matting.Route No. 10— contd. 10 MEHA .. 18 m. General direction N.- E. The track conti- 175J nues on the left bank of the river. The plain is gravelly and stony, bearing a good deal of scattered jungle, all of a thorny character, and much intersected by transverse ndlds. At about I j miles the river is crossed, and at 2| miles the track rises on to a gravel plateau. The river is here about 600 yards distant to the right, while some 3 miles off to the left is a range of steep hills about 500 feet high. Far away in front is visible the Kuh-i-Meha a square cut bluff of very similar appearance and character to Guh Kilh. At 31 miles the track again descends into the river-bed, which is here about 80 feet below the level of the plateau, the latter forming a precipitous scarp. The channel is broad and consists of beds of sand and shingle intermingled. It is crossed diago nally, and the further side is reached at about 700 yards. The track now continues on this bank, occasionally dropping into the channel itself as far as 9| miles, where there is a little hamlet of huts on the river bank. The stream is crossed again near here. At 12 miles this river is finally quitted; it goes off to the right. The path leads up a narrow ravine towards a low saddle, the crest of which is passed at 1| miles, between two peaks about 100 feet above the level of the pass. Immediately on the other side the bed of another small stream is entered, which is ascended. It runs in a narrow hollow between rocky elevations about 80 to 100 feet high. At 14-| miles this river bed is quitted, and another small water-shed crossed. At a little short of 16 miles the junction of two small drainage channels is reached, which come from right and left front. Here the track strikes across an undulating plain between the two streams but keeping nearer to the one on the right. At 17§ miles the track descends into the bed of this channel, which is extremely broken and rocky, and runs between precipitous and inaccessible banks. A quarter of a mile further on these banks fall back and become rather more practicable. Here is situated the little village of Meha among some low hillocks on the right bank of the channel. A footpath leads some 200 to 300 yards over the left bank of the river to a little grassy hollow in which is situated a small spring. The great Kuh-i-Meha is situated about 1 to 1J miles to the S.-E. of this spot. It is an enormous mass of rock with precipitous slopes and a nearly flat top.296 Route No. 10— contd. 11 MURI KUH .. 24 m. General direction E.- *— S.-E. The track 199J ascends the ravine on whose bank Meha is situated. It is here very narrow, shut in between high walls of rock, 60 or 70 feet high. At a point, some 300 yards from Meha, the width of the passage is only 9 or 10 feet, but beyond that the rocky walls come to an end and the path opens out on to a broken and undulating plain. The water-course is off to the left. At 2f miles the bed of the water-course is again entered, and a gorge between high rocky banks passed through. At a little short of 4 miles the track leaves the water-course on the left and cuts off a large bend of the river, rejoining it some 300 yards further on. It then tra verses some undulating country, crossing some low saddles, but the main water-shed is not reached until the 5th mile. The descent from this is somewhat steep—about 15° gradient—but the path is fairly good. At 500 yards from the crest of the kutal it strikes into a drainage channel which is followed down. The bed is rocky and stonj% with steeply sloping banks of gravel about 100 to 105 feet high. The country now becomes extre mely broken, abounding in detached hills and peaks of varying heights, some rising to an elevation of 200 to 300 feet. The road keeps near the general direction of the water-course last entered, till the latter finally goes off to the right, at about 8f miles. A mile and a quarter beyond another low watershed is crossed, a ridge between two isolated peaks, 200 to 300 feet high, and about 300 yards apart. Beyond this is another well- defined channel, which is followed down, till at 15 miles it joins a stream of water flowing from the left. This is a large rocky channel, with a scarped bank, 50 feet high on its further side. The top of this bank (the left one) is gained by a steep path, which leads on to an open gravel plain, with a range of low rocky hills, half a mile to the left, whence the ground slopes gently down to river-bed, come 300 yards to the right. This plain is crossed towards a low saddle beyond. On passing this there is a gentle descent, leading at 17J miles to another great ravine, with an extremely rocky bed, between perpendicular scarps. R contains a great deal of coarse reedy grass. There is a difficult path down into the bed of this ndld. Descend ing this, some few hundred yards lower down, it runs into another large and important river-bed, with a channel, some297 direct® t Tire ^ us the rar. ry narrot.i 5^' At i p- passage is i !ome to an f tidulating 3 thebeiol; veen bighr miles the to a large bail m Itther; ae low safe 3 5th mile, 1 i° gradieat-:' jrestofthek' followed k ! banks of tri' 1 becomes er oeaks of ran; 1 300 feet, I: rater-course 1 right, at a:; sr low waters; 200 to If is another' 15 miles it j; is a large re its further i jy a steep ft Ageoflowre nd slopes ge- t.

The track leads for a short distance up the large river-bed, inclining to the right, towards an opening which is visible in the left bank of the channel. This is the mouth of a narrow ravine, which is now ascended. The bed is somewhat stony, but the road is fairly good ; the banks are a sort of clayey shale, with a very steep slope, and about 60 feet high, but diminishing as the head of the ndld is approached. The latter has a very tortuous course, but at a little over 19 miles the track emerges on a broad open gravel plain with a good sprinkling of small shrubs. The direction is towards two conspicuous peaks, about 100 feet high, between which the track passes at 20 £ miles, and then descends gently into the bed of another small drain which is followed down to 20f miles, at which point it runs suddenly through a little gorge, only about 6 feet wide, between 30 feet rocky scarps, and debouches into another and much larger water-course coming from E. to W., whose bed is ascended. It is broad and shallow, and the track chiefly on the gravel plain beside it; good going. At 22 miles a small hamlet of the usual matting huts is passed. The well is situated some 2 miles further on, over gently undulating country, at the foot of some low slopes, on the S.-W. side of a small open plain of clayey soil. The water is fairly good; the so-cafled well being nothing but a shallow hole in the ground, about 5 feet in diametei. Water .—From well. 19 Camp .. 211 m.

At 1 8 the crest of a low tcutal and watershed is reached. The g rad “f ife is about 7°, and the path is fairly good, though stony. The descent is easy down a similar dry ndld. A rocky range of hills, 300 feet high, runs on the left about J mile distant, and to the right is an isolated precipitous hill, some 200 to 250 feet high, and only about a furlong distant. At 2 miles the ravine grows narrower, and the path worse : the country here is very broken and composed chiefly of a black slaty rock, in tin brittle strata turned up on edge. About 2J miles the track strikes into the dry bed of a larger drainage channel, coming from oehind tne isolated hill to the right. This water-course is followed down.298 Route No. 10— contd. first on the right and then on the left bank, to about 5| miles, where another small Icutal on the right bank is crossed. The path thus far is fairly good, through a gently undulating country. Beyond the toital the bed of the ravine is again struck, and crossed diagonally. A furlong further on another dry channel is crossed going in the same direction. The path then goes up a gentle incline over a low col, and on the right front is then seen the very large river-bed of the Kaur-i-Tutan. To the left are low rocky hills, about 80 to 100 feet high, whence the ground falls with a rapid slope to the river bank, which is about 20 feet high. The course is up-stream and the path lies on the right bank of the river. The track is good over a firm level plain of gravel. At 8J miles another very wide branch channel, joining in from the north, is reached. It is a bad crossing, being full of large rounded boulders. Immediately beyond it are the palm groves of Tutan, which are entered and traversed for about 100 yards, then coming out on to a bit of open ^cultivated ground, beyond which, at 8f miles, is the village of Tutan. This is one of the most important villages of the district, although it consists of only the usual style of miserable huts, constructed of palm leaf matting. The river runs about 80 yards to the S. of the village. Imme diately beyond it is a line of abrupt rocky hills about 150 feet high. Irom here the track continues on the right bank of the river. About 3 miles off to the left is a rocky range of bills some 500 feet high. To the right, beyond the river, are similar elevations about 150 feet high. The course is now pretty steaddy eastward, with no important deviations, and lies up the broad valley drained by the Kaur-i-Tutan. The track is a t airly good one, the plain being nearly level, and the soil grave%, YfV s P rj ' n kling of wormwood and other low bushes. At about 121 miles the river-bed is crossed, the track from here as ar as 141 miles, lying on the left bank, where the river is again crossed. At 16f miles this drainage channel is left to the e t, the track striking into undulating country.

The track continues 246 to descend the river bed. At about half a mile from the camp it quits the river-bed which goes off to the left. It is here a channel, 400 yards wide very rocky, and with a considerable growth of tamarisk bushes, and with a good stream of water. It then rises with an easy slope over the right bank towards a low saddle, whose crest is (reached at 2 miles. Two hundred yards to the right is a gravelly hill, 150 feet high, while a similar one, half that height, separates the path from the river on the left. Here a descent is made from the ridge down a narrow ravine, which debouches, half a mile beyond, on a small stony plain about a quarter of a mile wide. The track crosses this towards a little ridge of rock on the further side, which it passes over by an easy slope, and then descends again into the river-bed. On entering the latter, which is here full of coarse shingle, the track becomes difficult to follow. The river bed is now crossed and the track emerges on the left bank, and traverses a small gravelly plain for about a quarter of a mile, and then crosses a dry ndld from left to right and apparently joining the river-bed just quitted. Beyond this it goes up a short steep rise on to a gravelly plateau, about 60 feet above the bed of the water-course. The ascent is bad the gradient being 18° or 20°. A range of rocky and broken hills, 400 feet high, lies about 2 miles to the left, while about a quarter of a mile to the right is another channel, also con verging to the large river-bed. At 3§ miles it descends from the plateau and crosses a branch of the channels on the right, and then continues up a gravelly and well-defined valley. About .500 yards to the left are low gravel slopes, 60 to 80 feet high.300 Route No. 10— concld . while two miles in rear of them are the rocky hills above de scribed. About a quarter of a mile to the right is a lower range of similar hills, and between the track and them runs the main drainage channel of the valley, a shallow and unimportant channel. Some distance ahead up the valley is visible a curiously shaped isolated pinnacle, which is passed abreast of at 61 miles, about 100 yards to the right of the track. It is a mass of black rock, rising solitarily out of the plain, about 150 feet high. At 8f miles the track enters another very large but shallow wator-course, with a stony bed full of tamarisk, coming from left to right. It is about a quarter of a mile wide. Beyond this is reached an open plain of coarse gravel and stone, with a fa'r sprinkling of her and acacia trees, and intersected by many small dry nalas. Here the track forks, the left branch being taken. At 10|- miles a small date grove is passed, with a little group of palm leaf huts close by. The place is called Islam Kand. The country beyond is more broken and undulating. The soil is still gravelly and stony, but broken up by numerous small rocky knolls and water-courses. At 12J miles the track enters and crosses diagonally a large channel running from left rear to right front. It is about 150 yards wide, with a shingle bottom. Beyond it the country is still undulating but the soil more clayey. There is a gentle rise towards a low kutal the crest of which is reached at 14f miles. From here Bint is plainly visible, a good- sized mud fort standing up conspicuously in the midst of the village. The descent from the kutal is easy, down a shallow ravine, which runs on to a wide open plain. To the right front is a grand solitary cone of rock, fully 600 feet high. At a little over 15 miles a shallow ill-defined drainage channel is reached, crossing the plain from left to right, and containing a feeble trickle of water, round which is a narrow belt of marshy reedy ground.

A frothy foam appears at the corners of the mouth, the jaws close convulsively and the animal expires. Natives declare that they can save animals by administering a strong decoction of dates immediately after the poison has been swallowed; but this remedy, however efficacious when given immediately, is no good when administered 2 or 3 hours after the poison has been consumed. The only method of safe guarding animals through this part is to muzzle them so that they cannot'eat the poison.

The road rises gradually up over on almost level plain to the point, where the Shlrin Rud issues from the foot-hills. The road lies on the left bank of the stream, which is about 5 feet wide and varying in depth from 3 to 6 inches. The plain is stony and is covered with a growth of adrii and shura and other camel-grazing plants. The usual camping-ground is at the exit of the river from the hills. Hero four roads meet, namely, those from Garmab, Kerman, Naiband, and Khabis. Fuel can be obtained in large quantities from the branches of dry tamarisk trees to be found lying in the bed of the stream, whence they have been brought by floods. 2 SANGAVA .. 24 m. General direction S.-S.- W. For the first 3| miles the road leads up the stream of the Shirin Rud. The going is rough and stony and the stream has to be forded repeatedly, the depth of the water increasing rapidly as one advances. At about 3J miles the road leaves the bed of the stream turning up to the right over the left bank. It then runs over undulatino' stony ground in a direction nearly parallel to the course o°f the river. The turn out of the river-bed is easy to miss and caravans sometimes continue up the bed of the stream. This is a roundabout route and the going is very bad through rocky gorges, the sides of which tower high above on either hand. At about 11 miles the^road opce more.descends into the bed of the stream, which at This point rum in a broad open stony valley. After ascending the stream for a short distance the water again follows up the bed of the -stream into a narrow gorge, in which there is a good deal of tamarisk. At about 13 miles the road leaves the stream turning to the right up a ndld which comes in on the left bank of the stream. There is a good track there for some live miles, ascending over rolling- ground, on which there is a scanty growth of camel-thorn. The route then enters some very rugged and stony hill*. TheRoute No. I(/)— concld. -track at about 20 miles leaves the main water-course by which the hills were entered, and turns off to the left up a smaller ndld which leads to the foot of the Guda-i-Lakkar Kuh. The ascent of this pass is most trying to camels on account of the steepness, but it is not stony. From the summit of the pass the load descends gradually to the bottom of the main valley pf the Shirin Bud, which is reached at 24 miles. The track thioughout the descent is, on the whole, good and not very stony, but it is very narrow in places, being worn out of the sides of very precipitous hills formed of a shaly soil. It would be very difficult to make this pass fit for the passage of wheels, and it is considered that much labour would be necessitated in the construction of zig-zags and in widening the track. At the halting-place the stream lies in a gorge about 100 yards wide, shut in on either side by precipitous hills, which rise to •a height of several hundred feet. There is a plentiful supply of tamarisk for fuel and camel-grazing on the banks of the stream. The stream itself is about 6 inches deep and about 20 yards in width. 3 SAR-I-APSH (5,600') .. 9|-m.

It then follows a very wide valley running S.-E. and N.-W. for 5J miles, after which it enters a main ndld with a stream. The road ascends the bed of this stream with high hills on either side until a small hamlet with cultivation is reached. It then makes a rapid ascent for a mile in a north easterly direction until'a kutal the Gudar-i-Khorasani is reached. This is by far the highest point on the route being 7,650 feet high. From the kutal the road descends steadily along a winding road north wards among lowish .hills reaching Haruz on the main stream.

The track is not defined, and there is an infinite choice of routes in the river-bed and on the ddmcn on each side. The motor road is here a few hundred yards to the right. At | mile two telephone lines diverge, one to Khwash via Ladis, the other to Saindak. At 2 miles the motor road crosses to the right bank. At about 15 miles the motor road recrosses. A convenient halting place (owing to the pre sence of tdgaz for camel-grazing and fuel) is at 17 miles, but there is a very large choice. 2 PADAGl HILLS 17 m. The road continues up the Dar-i-Giaban.- 34 The valley begins to close in. At about 3 miles, water is said to exist at Kalgazi or Khurgazi, 2 or 3 miles to the K-E. It is convenient to leave the river-bed and proceed over the daman, which is usually free from stones, as the river-bed winds a great deal. At 7 miles the surface is almost white, owing to the presence of pieces of quartz. A ndld 50 yards broad is met with at mile 10. The motor road is crossed at mile lOf. At 13 miles the main river-bed is met with, with steep banks 6 feet high. The motor road runs in the river-bed, and is here met with for the last time, as it now strikes N. for Kacha. Then follows bad going, owing to the large number of nalds with steep sides which cross the route at right angles. There is abundance of scrub here. Padagi hills are reached at mile 17 and form a convenient halting-place. They consist of an isolated range, parallel to the valley, above which they rise about 400'.

This is about 12 miles in diameter, and contains several kdrezes and cultivation. The going is very bad after rain, as the soil turns into heavy mud. The Jikuti river is a scarcely noticeable depression. The place marked ‘ spr ’ on the degree sheet forms an excellent camping ground.

At about 6 miles, the mouth of a shallow defile is reached, which looks somewhat like a corridor amongst the much inter sected hills. The road runs partly along the bottom of the defile, leaving it later and going over the adjacent heights. Further on the Guzar-i-Siah Kuhi ridge is reached which is higher than the Guzar-i-Shur, and lies about seven miles from Shurab. Beyond the ridge a rough wide barren plain rises^ towards the Kuh-i-Bid ridge, the descent from the Guzar-i-Siah Kuhi is shorter and much more gentle than the ascent. The stony soil of the plain now becomes clayey and sandy, with hills here and there and a certain quantity of water. There are a few strong springs of fresh water forming a general stream flowing into the channel of Rud-i-Mirjawa. Just before the various springs unite into one stream is a very thick tamansk thicket. From this valley, the Darreh-i-Biaban, the Ruh-i-Taftan mountain is easily visible, and also the high ridges extending E. and N. from it. The valley was devoidRoute No. H(&amp;)— contd. of inhabitants at the time of the visit, but in the winter it is said that about 15 Baluch tents are pitched in it. The direc tion of the road now continues due N.-W., running up the valley close to the spurs of the Kuh-i-Bid range which lies immediately on the right. The main range is wild and rugged and almost inaccessible, and there is a good deal of scrub and brushwood on the plain although there is no grazing. About three to four miles further on the road ascends a water-course, and at 14 miles Bug is reached—a small space situated high along the hills which are covered with a good deal of under growth. There is a small spring, but in the spring and the earlv part of the summer much more water is obtainable, it would no doubt be possible to get water all the year round from the hills if they were properly worked. 3 KHARGAR 12 m. The general direction at first is N.-N.-W. gg Immediately after leaving Bug the road enters a defile bounded on the right by the main Kuh-i-Bid ridge, and on the left by another ridge equally high. The bed of the valley for the whole of its width is occupied by a water-course covered with stones. The vegeta tion on the mountain sides is so scanty as to make them appear almost bare. At the end of the defile the ground becomes more open and at this point, about 3 miles, Kaleh-i-Bid is reached, situated amongst hills of granite. A spring of fresh water runs from close beside the broad fiat clay hills lying on the left ba k of the water-course, and fills a shallow pit giving from five to eighteen buckets of water at a time. _ The water runs over ^ edge of the pit in small streams and is immediately lost in the soil Alongside the spring is a granite hillock with the tomb of some saint built of partly coloured stone and ornamentol with various devices.

Epitome. —The route links up the Dizak and Tahlab valleys while avoiding the difficult defiles of the Morplsh and GilE hills, and by its extension to Sangun gives the most direct connection between the Gazu valley and the country under the Kuh-i-Taftan. Sitahro is stage 12 of Route III and Gazu is in stage 6 of Route III (Alternative, E) while Sangun is stage of Route II. As far as Gazu, it is very easy for camels in fair weather, but would be very slippery, perhaps impassable after heavy rain. The first part of stage 3 is difficult, but not im practicable even for fully loaded camels. Stages 1 and 2 could easily be made fit for wheels. Picketing. —Slow in parts of stage 3 ; unnecessary else where. Camping-grounds. —Unlimited at each stage. Water. —Good throughout. Fuel. —Plentiful. Fodder. —Grass good ; grazing very good.

A rise of 1,800 53 ' • feet. Start S.-W, across the Gazu kaur at a slant and at 1 mile turn W. and then N.-W. up a small kaur, with the very steep Gatti Kuh on the right. About 6 miles a bridle-path goes straight up a336 TW Route No. 11(e)— concld. steep hill, which the camel track, a mile longer, avoids by a &lt;letour to the left. They rejoin at about 8£ miles and there immediately follows a long winding ascent,very steep in parts, to the pass (4,740 feet) 9 miles. A long easy descent; about 11 miles the valley contracts, and the path is here and there -difficult for camels, overhanging the steep and narrow bed of a small kaur, to 12 miles when it enters the wide, sandy, and grass filled valley of the Hoshap Kaur, which comes from Sangun and breaks through the hills to join the Gazu Kaur, a little below Gazu fort. Cross the stream and turn up it to N.-W., passing the remains of a large village now entirely deserted. To avoid a large curve, cross low hills with a fine view of the sharp peak of the Piran Shorap Kuh on the left. Rejoin the kaur and rise steadily to the big tree of Sangun, 17$ miles a magnificient old cypress, as least 25 feet in girth 5 feet from the ground. The inhabitants call it Mir Umr and say it is their ' 'paighamhar'. It is decorated with dhols, rags and many curious odds and ends. On open ground near the tree there is, at the proper season, a large settlement of gidans ; and on all sides of it a considerable area of cultivation, chiefly 3-monthly barley. Above the tree is an orchard with many kinds of fruit trees, now in sad disrepair, and above that an old fort, belonging to Sardar Behruz Khan Mir Balozai. A most picturesque view down the valley. Betyond the fort the valley contracts fot a short distance and turns W. Through thick jungle, tamarisk, with many creepers, crossing the kaur twice, for some hundreds of yards.

From aneroid readings in October 1916 the height of the summit appeared to be 12,450 feet, instead of 13,034 feet as on the map. Up to May, snow lies down to 12,030 feet, and before the end of November 1916 it was down to about 10,000 feet. It is said that the path to the summit from the Sangun side is blocked by ice until June and is only practicable for expert mountaineers.

Some steep rocky places to climb, the use of the hands sometimes necessary.- At about 12,100 feet an easier slope, from which arises the final cone, a very steep slope 300 feet high of sulphurous ash, on which one slips back two feet for every three one climbs. At the summit there is no regular water, but at several places the ground is riddled with small holes from which sulphurous smoke rises, and the heat is considerable. There are other vents on the ashy slope between the summit and the big cliff mentioned above. The view from the summit is magnificient, when not spoiled by haze.

Epitome .—Route is passable for all arms as far as Shoru (Stage 4), for cavalry as far as Hyderabad (Stage 5), small bodies of cavalry could doubtless get through all the way, but not a daily passage of that arm, owing to shortness of water. The largest force that could move along this route daily may be taken as | battalion Infantry with camel transport. The route is impracticable for the regular passage of troops in hot weather, owing to shortage of water, heat, glare and drift sand. After rain the stretch between Mazarab and Shurgaz would be impassable in places. Water .—Sufficient at all stages as far as Hyderabad for 200 camels daily.

There is an abundant water-supply with many irrigation channels for watering the fertile ground around ; the cultivation is at present limited owing to fear of Damanis ; in Kosha itself which consists of many “ gidans,” there are some apricot groves with various other kinds of trees dotted about. A small mud and stone fort commands the valley and has been the means of enabling the Kurds under Nauroz Khan to hold their own against the Damani raiders. The site is well suited for cantonments as the spurs mentioned above gradually spread out as they descend into “ Ragzas ” and plains, all of which could be watered from the Rud-i-Kosha and their past fertility restored. Helio and lamp communication could be opened between Khwash and Kosha and a road made between the two fit for wheeled transport,, at a nominal cost. The climate of Kosha is said to be much more healthy than that of Khwash. Lying farther up the valley of the Rud-i-Kosha are Varaj and Timandan, distant from Kosha the former 3 and the latter 5 miles; both are very picturesque and fertile. 3 KtjH-I-TAFTlN .. 25 m.

At 1 mile it crosses the dry bed of the Rud-i-Dagulan and continues steadily in the same direction until the Kuh-i-Panj Angusht is reached. Here, at 4 miles, a little to the left of the track and under the high jagged peak of the hill, is a spring, called Murtaza ’All, with excellent water, which issues out of the rock near a ziarat and irrigates a small patch of cultivation. Near the spring are a few palm trees. The track now turning slightly towards the S. enters the low range of Panj Angusht, and at 51 miles a :small nald containing grass is passed. The track then follows a stony water-course through the hills. The general direction is now westerly. At 7 miles, the Kuh-i-Narband is passed on the S. of the track. Behind this hill is a small spring of water. At 8 miles, the Rud-i-Kamari is reached after a long easy descent. The water here is very salt and unfit to drink. At 9 miles, the hills are left behind, and the track emerges on to the Dasht-i- Rudinar, a vast smooth plain, nearly 20 miles broad, covered with low bushes. The track is straight and absolutely smooth running in a west-south-westerly direction. At 10 miles, Kalagar is passed to the N. of the track.

The track now follows the southern base of the hills across the plain which is covered with scrub jungle till, at 7^ miles, a small well, Chah-i-Shahi, with bad water, is reached. From 4| miles to 9 miles the track lies over what appears to be a dried-up swamp, which would probably become very difficult after heavy rain. At 10 miles, the track enters the hills at point forming the right angle between two ranges and crosses the Rud-i-Tankan Hehmuki, a dry ndld. The hills to the S. bear the same nanie. The track now lies in a narrow valley between bare rocky hills, and follows, the right bank of the ndld. At 14 miles the track turns slightly to the S. The valley here opens out to about one and a half miles and closes in again. The track follows it in a southerly direction and makes straight for the low Siah Band range of hills. At 19 miles, the bed of the Jauri ndld is reached, in which is an excellent stream of water, three feet wide and six inches deep, flowing two miles per hour in a deep ndld between high cliffs of conglo merate.

There is a slight but steady ascent between parallel ranges of hills. At 3 miles, the ndld bifurcates and the track keeping to the left, swings round W. At 4 miles, a low kutal is crossed, and a gradual descent begins down a narrow water course which, however, widens out considerably. The track is now W.-N.-W. and is somewhat rough and stony. The water course merges into a broad ndld similar to the one left behind and named the Rud-i-Sartalaf. In this ndld are hundreds of wild pistachio trees.

The Siah Band on fehe E. gradually recedes as the track veers towards the Pansareh range. At 7 miles, the track leaves the main Bampur path, and turning due S. enters a ndld which it follows to 8 miles, at which point it quits it and makes for the low hills to the S. At 10 miles, a narrow but deep ndld is crossed, and the track turning S.-W. becomes rougher, as it approaches the hills. At 12 miles, turning due W. it enters the hills, and at 13 miles, descends into a stony ndld in a valley between two bare hills. The going in this ndld is very rough to 14-| miles, when the track again turns at right angles due S. up a narrow and very rocky gorge. At 15 miles it emerges from the gorge and con tinues S. The track is here quite impassable for guns, and lies in a valley strewn with boulders between two high hills. At miles, the track leaves the valley and ascends the hills on the W. of the ndld, whence it drops down into the valley which contains the village of Bazman at 21 miles. From 14J miles to Bazman the track is so stony and difficult that it is quite impossible to ride with any comfort; baggage animals cannot use the short cut up the hill-side at 20| miles, but must continue down the valley and swing round into Bazman at the end of it.

Some two miles to the W. lies the Siah Band range, and to the E. the high and precipitous Gajnan Kuh, running roughly E. and W., and culminating in the Kuh- i-Tank. At mile 13 the track reaches the foot of the Kuh-i- Tank, a bare and inaccessible peak, and runs along its base till mile 4, when the Kuh-i-Tank bears away to the N., a narrow gorge separating it from the Hehmukki Kuh. At mile 5 a shallow ndld running E. through the above-mentioned gorge is crossed, and the road follows the foot of the Hehmukki Kuh till a watershed (elevation 5,200 feet) is reached at mile 7. The track now runs N.-N.-W. across a treeless and gently un dulating plain. The Hehmuki Kuh bears off to the N., and the Siah Band range to the W., and at mile 14J the plain has a width of some 7 miles, the general fall of the ground being towards the N.-E., where the Jaurl ndld breaks through the hills.

The direction now is more to E. of S.-E. over a sandy plain, but with plenty of fuel in parts. The track skirts the Durmaz Kuh, which at 6-2 miles bears 29° and is about 1J miles to our left. The heavy going through sand gives place to stony ground at 8-5 miles, whence Kuh Shaikh can be seen bearing 212°. The next 8 miles are extermely monotonous ; at 16 miles the Kuh-i-Guh begins on the left, and the track passes over undulating ground. Skirt ing the base of the Kuh-i-Guh the track at 18 miles runs almost due E., and a few yards further on a torrent-bed is crossed, draining south ; and rolling hills are entered. The track con tinues through hills till 23 miles, when it enters on a level plateau, the direction now being E. of N.-E. At 24 miles the the Kuh-i-Guh ends and the Harneh Kuh begins. At 25 miles the track runs down a torrent-bed with tamarisk bushes and at 26 miles it joins the main road from Sistan to Bampur. Up to this point the route lies practically across country, no track being visible.

This route generally lies across a plain intersected by ranges of low hills ; the latter are not difficult for camels except in the first stage. The kavir between Ab-i-Rais and Rigan would be impassable for any transport in wet weather. Up to within 5 miles of Ab-i-Rais the plain is stony. Transport. —1,000 donkeys and 500 camels obtainable at Rigan. Alternative stages. —(1) From Ab-i-Rais to Deh Yaghi Khan via Nukabad ; (2) from Ab-i-Rais to Rigan via Nukabad and Chah Malik.

To the S. lies the Khh-i-Tachab. The descent is easy, the valley sometimes narrowing and sometimes opening out. There is a little brackish water to be obtained at 12 miles, where there are beds of high grass and reeds. At 15 miles another main ndld is passed, which can also be used, joining the one followed near the Kuh-i-Tachab. The hills which have been very precipitous gradually open out, until, near camp, the road is running in a broad torrent-bed. The main Sistan-Bampur road— vide Route 7 is passed at 19- miles.

About 4 miles, a solitary tamarisk is passed which forms a good landmark, after which the go ing improves, while there is excellent camel-grazing throughout. To the N.-W. the desert stretches for hundreds of miles, while to the S. the Kaskin range just above Bampur is conspicuous. To- the E.-S.'E. the great Bazman range is very conspicuous. At 15J miles thick tamarisk is entered, and thence on there are several good sites for a camp.

This is a j' 1 ? very long march which is difficult to divide there being no water or grazing en route. ^ The track runs across kavir which must be impassable for camels in wet weather. This is some five miles in width and on its western edge on the southern side of the track is a tiny spring of salt water, known as the wild asses’ spring. At SJ miles the road crosses a low col, and at 9J miles a road branches off to Ladis in a west-south-westerly direction. It was reported that there is a spring two miles to the S. used to water flocks when grazing after rain. At 10 miles a shallow torrent-bed is crossed which might be dangerous in wet weather. Prom this point all vegetation ceases, the track crossing a waste of stony plains apparently of volcanic origin. At 12 miles there are some low hills, and at 14£ miles the track rises through a rocky gorge called the Dahan-i-Bulbulak, through the Kuh-i-Zahian after which there is a steady descent, a wide torrent being crossed at 19| miles. At 26J miles, the road suddenly enters a thick -amarisk jungle. At 28J miles there is a qandt of drinkable water, and at 29 J miles the village of Deh Yaghi Khan is reached ;388 Route No. II(2 2 )— contd. a small village with a fort and qandts of drinkable water.

Beyond it the country becomes bare and open over which the track gradu ally ascends. At 10 miles the track enters thick jungle and the village of Rahmatabad is passed at 12 miles, a small village with excellent water.

There is a solitary date palm here. A track goes up the Grawani Kaur to the Grawani kalag, just in the skirts of the main range. Going on up the Band-i-Pulang Kaur to the N.-E., pass some patches of white clay, and at 10 miles reach a string of deep pools. Keep up the Kaur, N. and again N.-E. through hills, called the Lasaki Band ; some work was necessary before the camels could pass. About 11J miles, cross the Lasaki Sham, and descend into the Chitkan Kaur, just below a short but difficult tangi. It took 40 men to make a way for the camels up a steep rock and through a pool full of sharp and slippery stones. Above the tangi, turn S.-_W. for 100 yards, and then N.-W. into a cleft through the Pud Band, between walls 20' to 50' high of red sandstone. At one place some rocks had to be ramped for the camels/near here is a huge cavern which could shelter several hundred men. At about 12J miles the track widens again but continues to wind through the hills, generally W.-N.-W. At 13 miles on to the low rounded hills on the left bank of the kaur : at 144 miles the track goes off to the right to Bath Buzurg Kalaq.

At the bottom is a tor call ed Badak which breaks through the hills to E. and joins the Ba i Buzurg Kaur. A path practicable for men only goesdown it. It is joined at the place called Maitimbar by the Tachap Kaur (galloping water). Just above the mouth of this tor, the track cilmbs an almost perpendicular wall of rock some 6 high ; it looks hopeless, but the camels contrived to scramble up it. Then into the bed of the Tachap Kaur, running through a very narrow gorge called Hashimi Jur, full of trees and grass, and with steep hills on either side. There is a lot of water and wherever possible soil has been collected m small bands and date palms planted. At the upper end is a steep ascent of 90 by zigzags, the last few yards very narrow among rocks. This is the PulgichorChitkaniKandah (4,730 ), 6 miles. The descent to the north is gentle. About 6* miles a footpath goes ofl to Bauruhl.

Over a shoulder into a kaur run ning E., which is left when it bends to the N., at 3 miles. Then over more low hills to Kashok 5 miles, a little valley, where the track meets that from Maindar to Dizak [see Route III (a)], In the N.-W. corner is a spring of good water. From Kashok a track leads directly over the hills to Bauruhi, but the better route joins the Dizak track and turns N., down the Ali Gungan Kaur for j mile to a solitary date palm, where the stream enters a small gorge. The Dizak track goes on over the hills W. of396 Route No. HI (6)— contd. the gorge. Turn E. over low hills to 51 miles, Nokband, a new band enclosing sdme 2 acres of cultivable land, followed by a series of older bands. After passing through more low hills at 7 miles cross the Maindari Kaur, no water on the surface but easily obtained by digging. At miles join the direct track between Hiduch and Murti. Over more low hills to 8| miles, the Bauruhi Kaur. Up its left bank to 9 miles Chandaran, an extensive camping-ground on level dan, 30 feet above the stream (height about 4,060') with a fair supply of water in the kaur. An unlimited supply could be obtained by digging shallow wells. The large village of Bauruhi, with a date grove 2 miles long, lies about a mile up stream. The pedple of Bauruhi were very friendly (September 1916) and brought dates, karbi, milk, etc. Leaving Chandaran, the track crosses the Bauruhi Kaur at 9| m les, and passes along a ridge above the village into a small kaur running E. At 11 miles a patch of cultivated lan&lt;i called Khairabad; at 11J miles cross the Hujdabad Kaur, running north to join the Shaitab. Then a steep drop of 40' into the Soraki Kaur also running N. Up its right bank and on E. to 12 miles a small patch of date palms on the Hakimi Kaur. The Hakimi kalag, hidden by hills is j mile to the south. On over low hills to 13| miles, a small spring in a nameless nala : the Murti fort now comes into view. At 13f miles pass Gaziok kalag, and cross a low shoulder into the Murti valley. A small masjid and part of Murti village are seen on the right. At 14J miles across the Murti Kaur, and climb some 30' to camp. The Murti village, with its fort, which is of no strength and com manded from hills at short range, and a long straggling series of date groves, lie about 1 mile up stream. Murti is the head quarters of Bampusht district, which is under Dizak. The Sardar is Fateh Muhammad Durazai. Probably because of a closer connection with Dizak the people here are more suspicious of strangers than those further west in Bampusht, but soon become friendly. No great love is lost between the Durazais and their upstart rulers the Baranzais. A track leads direct from Murti to Dizak. Cam'ping-ground. Level and unlimited in area.

The track to Dizak here branches off to the left, going straight up and across the Shuran Band. About 4 miles pass a large standing stone, with several smaller stones close to it on the left of the track. It is called Mogal, because a Mogal •army once camped near it. About 4|- miles enter the Bam- bhusar Kaur, which for some distance has been running nearly parallel to the Shaitab on the right. At 4f miles rise on to its right bank, about 150 yards above its junction with the Shaitab. At 5 miles cross the Shaitab, and for nearly 2 miles pass over a wide level dan to the E.

At | mile, a small kutal is passed and, at 1| miles the village of Naskand is seen about i- mile to the W. Sehmachan is then pissed and the track continues E. and, at 3 miles, crosses a steep kutal, which, though short, is rather trying for camels. Having crossed the kutal, the track traverses an undulating plateau and, gradually veering round to the W., descends into the Gwimak kaur at 4 nr'les. The track is good and well defined, and is invariably used now by travellers in preference to the river-bed. From mile 4, up river-bed, 400 yards wide and covered with jungle. On W. side about a mile off is a broken irregular range of hills, E. side low, easy hills close up to river-bed. Mile 6 river-bed narrows to about 100 yards, and hills close in on both sides. From now on, the road is a long, narrow river-bed, and434 Koute No. III(r)— contd. on both sides are masses of low, irregular, shaly hills, averaging 200 feet high. At mile 10 th3 river is not more than 50 yards wide. Here is the first pool of water. Further up the nald, at anile 11, there are large pools and a trickling stream, sufficient for a brigade. Place is called Jangja. Room to camp is the difficulty. Must bo chiefly in ndld bed. Some room for in fantry on ridges of low hills. Coarse grass abundant. Camel grazing scarce. At about 11 miles the track turns off at a right angle up a ravine on the E. bank and, after follow ing this up for a few’ yards, climbs up the hills in a northerly direction and, after traversing a plateau, finally descends again into the river-bed by a very steep path at 13 miles. About | mile after leaving the river-bed the track descends and ascends the steep sides of a large tributary, w r hich -contains water. This track, though invariably used by caravans at the present time, and very v 7 ell defined, is extremely difficult for camels owing to the continual steep ascents and descents. Ogilvie says that his camels took about 2| hours to traverse this distance of about 2 miles. Mile 13 a bad rocky place, but passable for camels. Mile 141 a very difficult place. Pool 50 yards long, apparently 6 feet deep. Track over broken, shaly rock immediately under per pendicular W. bank, and only passable for laden camels with great care. Working party would make track easy in half an hour. Beyond this point the river makes a short curve towards E. Going rocky. Round this curve, at mile 15, a tributary flows in from E. side, with small stream. Just beyond, at the next corner, is a patch of alluvial deposit 200 yards by 25 yards. Place called TurkI Bint.

Here the river bears away at a magnetic bearing of 75°, whilst the path con tinues at a magnetic bearing of 120° over flat ground on old river bed, till the small hamlet and date-grove of Apeshki is reached at 4 miles. The track then crosses a low kutal and, proceeding due S. down a small ndld, joins the main river again at mile 4| at a small date-grove. At this point the river is 100 yards wide. On the left bank are cliffs 60 feetRoute No. \{c)—contd. high and on the right a rocky slope 300 feet in height, against which the river strikes and bears away at a magnetic bearing of 125°. At 5} miles its junction takes place with the Geh river, a wide open valley bearing 25 degrees. Both rivers have a strong flow of water, and the united stream now' flows S. to Nok-i-Jahan, the track following its stony bed as far as mile 6, wdiere the river bears away to the S. and the track ascends a side ndla in a S. easterly direction amongst low and shaly hills. It is here traceable only with great difficultv as the going is stony. At 7 miles crossing a low kiital an easy descent is made into a tidlu, which at mile 9^ widens out to a barren plain, and at mile 10 crosses the main caravan road from Chahbar to Geh, a well-worn track. The country continues open and the track follows a nolo, 50 yards wide as far as mile 12J, when the ndla runs S. towards the Kuh-i-Puzak. At mile 13 ’ the track turning E. up a side ndla amongst low hills, crosses a low Iculal at mile 14. The whole country is absolutely barren except for pish in the larger ndlds. At mile 15 another ndld is crossed, which runs S. S. W. towards Puzak, and a clear view is obtained for some miles down the river Geh. The track now follow's the course of the MIrashur ndld (magnetic bearing 80) full of pish. At mile 15| a track, fit for camels, leads iST. E. to Shalmahal. The Mirashur ndld contains good water and tamarisk, but the hills are quite bare. At mile 17 a range of hills is seen to the S., some 500 feet in height, and the road lies over low Jcutals and up small ndlds among low hills, till, at mile 16, a pass of about 1,400 feet is crossed, whence a des cend is made to camp along a ndld containing pish, and pools of water. After passing through a narrow' ravine at 17 miles, camp is reached at mile 20, from which the bearing of Puzak peak is 175°. Camping ground. —On gravel plateau on the left bank of the ndld.

An ascent is then made to an open plateau, whence the track continues S. E. At mile 3f the Murgi kaur is crossed, 200 feet wide, containing tamarisk and shallow pools of water, but generally dry in summer. A low kiital is crossed at 4J miles and at miles o a track branches off to Pishmant and Chahbar, fit for camels. The road then runs E. over flat ground between low barren hills, crossing the Gazik Kaur, 100 feet -wide at mile 7, and the Mandust Kaur, 200 feet wide and full of pish and tamarisk, at mile 8, up which a camel track runs from Chahbar to Qasr- qand via Pishmant. Track now continues over low hills, and at mile 9 another pish ndld is crossed running S. into the main ndld, which runs E. and W. a mile off. Track now ascends a narrow twisting ndld in sand stone hills, and rises 300 feet in the next mile to the summit of a range of hills. These hills are covered with vegetation and grass, in marked contrast to the preceding barrenness. Near the summit a track leads down to a spring of water on the S. face of the hill. Descend 100 feet to a ndld between two high ranges (+500 feet), where there is a halting place with grazing, water, shade, and grass for horses, but not much room to camp the track now ascends this ndld due E., good going over gravel to the summit (mile 13) of the pass, height 1,390 feet above sea level. High hills of sand-stone rise up on each side to a height of 500 feet above the pass. At mile 14 are springs of water, and grass, and thence water is found all along the ndld in a thin trickle. At mile 16g valley opens out, and streams turn S. through the southern range of hills. The track follows a plateau on the right bank, and at mile 17 an extensive view opens out to the Puzak range, 5 miles S. The track runs over a gravel plain on right bank of the ndld, and at mile 18, crosses to left bank.

The going is good, over a gravel plain, covered with some jungle At 6| miles the road joins the river again at Surag Dap, a descent of 40 feet being made to the river-bed. There are large quantities of boulders and barshon grass, and the going is bad. At mile 84 an ascent is made to a low gravel plateau, between which and the high cliffs on the right bank of the river, the w'hole flood of the river seems to flow in a stream 200 yards broad by 20 feet deep. At mile 10 the road re-enters the river-bed, and the going is now better as there is more sand and less stones.

General direction N.- E. Follow Route V, stage 7, up the 2 stage /, up thi Kaju Kaur to the mouth of the Gwasha (Koshat) Kaur 3 miles. Turn up the kaur which does not alter in characte until about 7 miles, when the range of hills which shut in thi river, with high precipitous banks, is passed,and the channe becomes more open. The banks are very high varvim from 50 to 150 feet, forming steep slopes of grLvel an decomposed rock. The river-bed here contains runnim water, and a good deal of tamarisk scrub. At abom 10J miles, the water-course divides into two branches and the track ascends about 50 feet on to the smal level plateau between the two. The road continues on th« plateau for about five furlongs, and then descends again inti the river-bed, which is followed with continual crossings anc deviations on to both banks, as far as 15J‘miles. The whole way the channel is very stony, enclosed between steeply slonins banks, varying from 30 feet to 100 feet in height. At 15J miles, it becomes a narrow ravine, running sharply up to the crest of a water-shed, which is reached at about 16i miles The track which is now fairly level, on an undulating gravelly plateau, to about 17 miles, where it again descends Into the bed of a drainage channel and follows it down. At 18 1 miles this channel goes off to the right, and about a quarter of a mile beyond the road rises by a gentle slope on to a gravelly plateau,Route No. V(/)— contd. about 40 feet above the level of the ravine. This is crossed by two or three dry ndlds running from left to right. At 19£ miles, after another short ascent, the road leads on to the top of a small ridge, beyond which it enters another important water-course. The bed of this is ascended ; it is dry and very rough and stony, and enclosed between steeply sloping banks from 40 to 80 feet high. At 20| miles, it becomes so broken and intersected by transverse reefs of rock, as to be barely passable for camels. At 21£ miles, another rocky ravine, con taining water, comes in on the right. At 21f miles, there is a level patch of ground on the top of the left bank. One of the ndlds through which the track passes is the Kanigan Kaur, where this route is joined by a track branching off from Route V, stage 8 at Kanigan Daf. Further details are wanting.

The track con- 411 tinues along the gra velly plain on the left bank of the deep sunken ravine which was ascended in the previous stage. The latter shortly goes away to the left, and the road traverses a narrow shallow' valley, enclosed between rounded hillocks, 40 to 60 feet high. Further on the valley contracts, and at 2 miles becomes a narrow ravine, between precipitous banks, 80 to 100 feet in height. At 2J miles, it rises by a steep and rocky ascent on to a low Icutal. For the next mile and three quarters it crosses a con stant succession of low ridges with dry ndlds between, all run- nin 0, down from left to right. On the right, oOO yards distant, is a°mass of rocky hills, 200 feet in height. Some of the short ascents and descents are very steep and rocky, and altogether it is a fatiguing and bad section for the transport animals. At a little over 41 miles, the road strikes into th e&gt; bed of a water-channel coming from N. to S., and follows it up. ^ It is like all the ndlds in this country, stony, and shut m by high 16 A478 Route No. Y{f)~conld. banks of decomposing rocks. As the road proceeds the latter increase in height, till they are in many places cliffs of 80 to 100 feet in height. At 7£ miles, the road comes to the extreme head of this ravine, where the bed becomes so broken and blocked with reefs of rock, as to be very difficult travelling. At a little short of 8-| miles, the road comes out on to a ridee forming an important water-shed. It is just at the foot of a precipitous mass of rock, some 400 feet high, which towers up close on the right. Hence the track leads down the bed of a narrow tortuous rocky ravine, with high precipitous banks. At 10^ miles, after crossing a low col. it enters another ravine runmng in an opposite direction. The track only as cends the bed of the latter ravine for about 400 yards, it bein^ extremely bad and rocky, and then rises on to a small stonv plam on ,t 3 left bank. The ravine in the meantSfeakTI curve off to a distance of 200 yards to the left. At 12 miles it sweeps round again and is crossed by the path, which £ cends from the plain by an easy but very rocky slope. After crossing the stream the track leads over an undulating pla n sloping rather to the left, and intersected by small dry running in that direction. At a little less than H miles a short but rocky and difficult ascent is reached, which leads ,m to the top of a low col. Two other ridges are'erossed immSe ? afterwards, at intervals of a few hundred yards, and the frack enters and begins to ascend a good sized water-course i iout 18j miles the track crosses a broken undulating plain culti- vated here and there m isolated patches.

On the right it is bounded by isolated rocky peaks, ranging from 100 to 200 feet in height. To the left are gravel slopes, 30 to 60 feet high, behind which, about two or three miles off, is the Band- i-Ahuwan, rising to fully 800 feet. The track keeps mostly to the left bank, passing numerous gorbands en route, some of which are of great size. At about 11 miles, the slopes on the left develop into a precipitous ridge of rock, some 300 feet high, and coming close down to the edge of the water course. At 12J miles this terminates at the junction of the channel along which the road has been running with the Sarbaz river.

Thence rise continually in the same direction, up and down hills and valleys 50 feet deep, over soft sand covered with scrub to mile 12 (elevation 2,300 feet). Banks of drift sand are stretched at intervals among the hills. From the summit there is an extensive view towards the no£th.488 Route No. VI(d)— contd. To mile 15£ cros-i rollirg hills and valleys, 100 feet deep with banks of sand and some bushes (elevation 2,540 feet). The going now becomes more difficult, owing to sand, and camels make slow progress. At mile 17J cross a dry ndld, about 20 feet wide, flowing N.-W. winding among the hills (elevation 2,550 feet). At mile 23 cross the Surmich ndld; the dry shingly bed comes from the S. down an open stony glacis, dotted with «ome scrub, from Surmich.

Proceed over bare stony country to Ispakeh at mile 30 passing some hills on the S. side of the track. Ispakeh lies on the left bank of a broad stony ndld, 440 yards wide. There is a grove of date palms more than a mile long, and extensive cultivation.

Cross the ndld bed, 100 yards wide and cross a stony plateau with deep ndlds to Upper Surmich (elevation 3,562 feet) at mile 12J, where there is a large date grove and some wheat cultivation. Continue up a stony ndld with a daman on both sides, 2 miles wide to the foot of hills. Pass some deserted fields and a fev r huts. At mile 17 the head of the valley is reached, and the track ascends into a narrow gully between low shale hills. This ndld gradually narrows to a width of 20 yards at mile 18f (eleva tion 3,995 feet), where Aspagan spring is reached. There are a few date palms. Climb a sharp rise of 20 feet over rocks and proceed for quarter of a mile across a small basin. The ndld then turns sharply to the N. and becomes a rocky torrent, with steep steps of roek and twists of 180°, for a quarter of a mile, to mile 19£. There is nov an abrupt rise 110 feef in 200 yards to the summit of the Aspagan pass (4,256 feet). From the Aspagan spring to the summit of the Aspagan pass, it is quite impassable for wheels, and is difficult for camels. It would take a pioneer battalion, with explosives, a week to make this half mile fit for wheels. Descending from the pass, the going is easy on the S. eastern side, down a nald, which gradually widens to 50 yards, between quite low hills or open country, passable for infantry. At mile 26J leave the ndld and turn due S. to Champ, at first across a gravelly plateau and then through some hills crossing two deep ndlds, 50 yards wide, containing water flowing N. E.. Champ lies in a gravelly valley, surrounded by mountains. There is a sharp fall towards the X., and an extensive view in that direction of difficult mountainous country and the Palamgar Peak. The village consists of huts built of pish and lies on the E. side of a square serai or fort. The fort is in good repair and contains a three-storied building on the W. side. It is of no great military value. Rustam Khan, chief of Champ, etc., resides here. Oranges (bitter) are grown. Rustam Khan controls the road to Qasrqand and it is not advisable to leave Qasrqand for Champ without an escort of Rustam Khan s men. The district is wild and mountainous.

Avery little labour at these rough places would render it passable for wheeled artillery. The general direction is a little N. of W. and there is little devia tion. The first stage crosses the watershed between the Gongh and Sarha rivers, leaving the Shushen Kuh on the left; the second and third keep along the trough S. of the Fanuch and Lashar hills crossing numerous ndlds, which descend from the N. and flow either E. or W. until they can find a breach in the lower hills to the S. and resume their journey to the sea; and finally the Bint valley is entered close to the town. Picquetting. —^Unnecessary, except perhaps for a short distance before reaching the Sarha river in stage 1; elsewhere flank guards sufficient. Camping grovjnds. —Large. Water .—Good throughout.

Keep up it for a short distance and cross on to the right bank, but soon recross the river and keep up it to 4 miles. Cross once more to the right bank with the small grove of Qasrmum under the peak of Shushen on the left front and turn up the Kiken Kaur to the W. Going casv sometimes stony, often sandy. At 8 miles Sar-i-Sham the watershed, descend a small wala for a few hundred yards * into a biggish Kaur running W. and then S.-W. At nearlv 9 miles turn up a tributary to the W. and lOJ miles reach another watershed of no height and descend the Kaushk Kaur passins the small Kaushk kalag. Here the track is narrow and rather slippery. At fully 11 miles enter the bed of the Sarha river and turn up it for nearly a mile to camp on the right bank The place is also known as MulJal kalag or Kalagan A fringe of date palms lines both banks wherever there is a ledge The first of soil on which they can grow. From her*e a track easy for few miles and probably all the way, goes up the kaur to Hichan (Route VI, stage 7).

For the next J mile the ground is very broken, to the Sohran Kaur, running S. Route YII (e) branches off near here. Cross the kaur, ascend a little and descend to a wide valley a dan broken by various branches, running E. and then S., of the Dansara Kaur. The Hichan Band lies to the N. and the Kuh-i-Lab to the S. At 8 miles the dan is broken by low hills and the track descends into the Kaur-i-Kuh-i-Lab,'flowing E. Turn up it to 10| miles, a watershed (about 2,020 feet), which is the boundary between the ildqas of Geh and Bint. ’Hence the track is almost all down hill, but never noticeably steep. Down gently into the DarhinI Kaur, coming from X. and turning W. At 13J miles on to its left bank, near traces of old cultiva tion. At 14 miles the Kuh-i-Lab kalag lies 2 miles on the left Putap kalag J mile on the right. Xear here route Xo. 102 comes in from the S.-E. and branches off to the X.-W. about a mile further on. At 15 miles descend into the kaur, now called Puschahi, a wide bed, and soon after from PuschahiSunt traces of old cultivation and water evidently very near the surface. The hills here approach the kaur from the S. and deflect it to X.-W. The track leaves it, inclining S. of W. and passes more old cultivation. At 17 J miles cross the Sohrok Kaur flowing S., no permanent stream.

At nearly 3 miles cross back to lelt bank just above a waterfall of 40 feet (dry in January 1917) Nearly 4 miles cross again, where the kaur, now larger, bends to S. At 5 miles begin to ascend slightly; fully 51 niiles cross watershed and descend over rough ground into the Gokanaf Kaur. At 8 miles cross a large tributary running E to 11 miles an easy water shed (about 1,490 feet). The Murtan Kuh, black and conical, lies in front, and the Fanuch Band on the right. At 12 miles cross the Gwan Kaur runnin 0, S and over broken ground at the base of Murtan which lies on the right. At 13 miles enter valley of large Icaur flowing S.-E -to meet the Gwan Kaur and turn up it. The Si Purg (30 fold) mountain which commands Bint stands up in front like a white teacosy. At fully 14 miles the last watershed. The Bint valley now lies before the eyes, and the track branches, one to the right to Bint Fort and the other straight on the Sheh Han under Si Purg. In either case there is a gentle descent to the Bint river, the stony bed fully | mile wide, with one small flowing channel. To go to the fort, the river is crossed just above some rocks which rise from its bed, and the track then passes through cultivation and date groves to near the main village. The other track aims direct at the summit of Si Purg and crosses the river just above the little village of Sheh Han. Bint lies in a fertile plain of some 2 square miles on the right bank of the river—a gorge above, another below, the S. Purg in the S.-W. corner and barren dan on the left bank. There are large date groves and extensive cultivation. It is in the hands of a family of the Rais tribe, which Mir Islam Khan506 Route No. \ll{d)—concld. raised from obscurity. He was in Persian times a Sub-Contrac tor of reyenue under Sardar Said Khan, and in the latter’s old age and after his death achieved quasi-independence. He was the most civilised of all the rulers of Persian Baluchistan, and endeavoured to make improvements, opening kdrezes and planting numbers of young date palms. He was murdered in September 1917 by his brother Sahib Khan, and it is uncertain (January 1918) whether his son Yahya Khan or his brothers Sahib Khan and Nagdi Khan will prevail. Except Islam Khan,, who looked like a Sindhi zamindar, the family are unprepos sessing, with coarse twisted lips and bad eyes. The Bint fort is very large but not in good repair. It is in a good position, commanding the village, and itself only commanded at long range. Camping grounds .—Several large sites, all commanded by hills.

After crossing the Geh river, track 39 climbs on to a stony plain on its left bank meets Route No. VI and runs S.-E. until it meets the river again at a point, at mile 5, where a small ndld from the N. joins it; another track from Geh comes down this ndld, | mile up which and near left bank, is a conspicuous rounded pinnacle of black rock, 150 feet high. From here the track runs down the bed of the Geh river to camping ground of Puzak (see Route VI, alternative A) on left bank, at junction of Garjan and Geh rivers. Two miles further down the track leaves the river bed at the lower end of the gorge formed by the Puzak range of hills, and climbs up the left bank 30 feet on to a stony plateau (at this point it leaves the road to Ziarat) across which it runs on a well-marked track parallel to the Geh river. At mile 10, it drops into a small ndld just above its junction with the main stream and turns E. up its bed, emero-- ing on to an elevated stony plain at the head of the ndld at mile 11J. It continues E. for J mile, then drops into the head of another ndld running at first E. and then curving S. It follows this ndld to its junction with another and larger one from the E. at mile 12j.

Epitome. —This is a caravan route between Bampur and: Jiruft. In wet weather the road is extremely difficult and.Route No. almost impracticable, owing to its muddy nature. There are no supplies to be obtained, and in dry weather the water-supply could not be relied on, as many of the wells are fallen in or out of repair. The road throughout the entire distance lies over a desert soil of which in wet weather becomes a regular quagmire; and numerous watercourses have to be crossed which flow down from the hills into the Jaz Murian Hamun, but none of them appear to present any difficulty, except when full of water. Climate .—There is very little information concerning the climate that would be experienced on this route, but in the summer time the heat would probably be so great, and, owing to the proximity of the Jaz Murfan Hamun, so unhealthy, that it would not be found expedient to move troops along it. In the winter the climate appears to be good. Water .—The water is principally obtained from wells, but as these are in many cases fallen in they could not be relied on in a very dry season. In times of rain there is no difficulty concern, ing water as it would* be found in the numerous water-courses which have to be crossed. Fuel .—Is obtainable at most of the halting-places, and is very plentiful in the earlier stages. Fodder. —Camel-grazing appears to be ample all along the route. Supplies .—Supplies are so scarce along the route that it would not be possible to move even the smallest body of men along the route unless all supplies were carried, or collected, beforehand.

Ephitome .—The route is practicable for wheeled artillery, though in places the going would be very heavy, and the banks ol the rivers would have to be ramped. The country generally is a flat open plain and the going good. In^ places the ground is soft and much cut up, and near Girau and Jask telegraph office very sandy. Most of the way there is nothing to prevent troops moving on a broad ront, but the track should be followed by baggage animals, as the ground is firmer under the hills. The marshy country along the coast is said to contain quicksands. After rains the whole country would be impassable for 2 or 3 days. Water. Somewhat scarce in summer, might with care suffice or 1 battalion. It is said- to be plentiful in winter.

Thence to mile 9 a sandy plain with a few patches of wheat, and at mile 9 cross a lowdying mud flat or watercourse J mile wide, heavy going, lying along the foot of a ridge of sand and sand stone. Thence to mile 12 cross an undulating sandy country, with good camel-grazing, and a low ridge of sandstone J mile E. of the road. At mile 12J Kunar Isma’Il village with large date-groves and wheat-fields. Continue over sandy country in a S.-E. direction, passing 2 date-groves about 2 miles W. Jumahalleh is a village of 50 houses on a river, with large area of wheat along the river, but no dates. This should be the halting-place, , as the river is impassable in flood for 3 days and should, therefore, be crossed as soon as possible. The ford is just below a sand-bluff 50 feet high which, ends the low sand stone range above mentioned.

This hill, which is visible from Kunar Isma’Il on the N. and must be a conspicuous landmark from the sea, is a tower of sandstone and marl 80 to 100 feet high with a summit sloping towards the sea. Access to the summit, which is surrounded by a low stone wall and is apparently used as a citadel, appears to be obtained from the S.-W. corner by a steep ascent. The village lies on its S. side on a high sandhill on the sea coast and contains probably 100 people of a negroid type, who live in mud houses, and engage in fishing, and trade with Bashakard.

At 3 miles a road branches off E. across the plain to Baharkump in the Jagin valley. This road is reported to have a bad de scent into a ndld which renders it unsuitable for camels. For this reason the route via the Kwaik ndld is usually followed, though several miles longer.

After winding through this defile for another mile the Tang-i- Duhl, only 20 yards broad, under mud cliffs, is passed at 4 miles. This tang extends for about 100 yards. Running water loses itself in the tang, but owing to the surface salt is too bitter to drink. Sweet water can be obtained by digging down a few feet below the surface. The pass now gradually widens out, and, though the bed is still from 100 to 200 yards wide, the hills to the E. gradually fall to lower levels.

Epitome.—The route starts from Bandar Sirik 2 miles W. of Sirik. ^ At 10 miles the entrance to the Sarzeh tangl is reached. The tangi is in places nearly a mile wide and, as all the hills slope from the W. and are steeply scarped from the E., they afford excellent cover to a force marching from the sea. The tangi extends for about a mile and then enters the Sarzeh valley through a tangi between inaccessible hills about 400 yardsRoute No. VIII(/) — contd. wide.

After about a mile up the river-bed the road ascends to the Sarzeh Fort over a level plain commanded by a low ridge 2,000 yards distant on a spur of which stands the fort. Landing .—Owing to the extensive marches and sand-banks at the mouth of the Gaz river, Bandar Sirik is the only suitable spot to land ; though possibly at high spring-tides a steam- launch might be able to cross the bar to Sirik creek and tow the boats up a mile, thus saving 3 miles. Water .—Can be obtained from the wells at Bailal, Banni,. Sirik, Tumrahl, and Kardar, at latter place plentiful and good.

The ruined fort of Mahmundi, behind the first grove of palms, would give a good starting-point. The road skirts the Sirik palm-groves practically the whole way to Kardar. The western path should be followed as far as TumrahT, 6 miles, the groves of which are visible from Sirik. After Tumrahi the eastern track should be taken to Kardar, 8 miles. This point is suitable for a halt. Wood and water are plentiful, and fires would not be noticed in the Kardar groves. From Kardar the road turns E. to the tangi, the gap of which is clearly visible. The Gaz river lies about | mile to the S. The country is fairly wooded up to the river at the entrance to the tangi. At 10 miles some low hills are met, to the W. of the river, affording a good artillery position. S. of the road high ground commands the river-bed, but the hills are only accessible from the W. Immediately below the low hills above mentioned the Gaz river sweeps round a bend from the N. The hills on this side end in cliffs over the river.-579 Route No. VIII(/) — contd. The bed of the river is 50 yards broad, but has a high level bed of 25 yards on either side. There was running water in August, but it was too bitter to drink. The banks at the crossing-piace present no difficulty, but would have to be ramped for wheeled artillery. On ascending the eastern bank, the road passes under hills to the S., and a series of rocky knolls to the N., and then leads over an open plain. At lOf miles the road passes through a narrow gap in a rocky ridge some 50 feet high. Wheeled artillery might find some difficulty here though the gap is only 100 yards long. From here the road crosses a level plain, 2 miles wide, for 800 yards to the actual tangi, where it again descends into the river. The road between these 2 points may be described as the chord of an arc made by the river which flows under high inaccessible hills on the N. The actual tangi is about 100 yards wide at a point where the river cuts through inaccessible hills, ending in cliffs and 600 feet high. This point is commanded by a hill 500 yards tft the E. A feature of all the hills in the past is that, while they slope up from the W., they end in cliffs towards the E. The hill com manding the tangi appears, however, to have passages down it on the E. After another | mile, at 12 miles, the road leaves the river bed and ascends to a bare plain of pat. Between this point and the tangi the broken ground in the river-bed affords a certain amount of cover. The hills on the northern bank come down to the river-bed in cliffs. The road now turns to the S.-E. and is commanded by a shur ridge, 30 feet high, at about 1,200 yards, which is, in its turn, commanded by a rocky ridge, some 80 feet high, 500 yards further back, on a peak of which lies Sarzeh fort (in bad repair, 1910). Both .these small ridges are isolated and could easily be turned. The Afghan headquarters, 1909-10, were situated immediately under the second ridge. The Sarzeh cultivation lies immediately to the E. of these ridges. S.-W. towards Faig the ground is broken. Sarzeh .—The valley is some 7 miles from N. to S. and 5 miles from E. to W. The Gaz river roughly divides the valley in half from E. to W.

The Lard (gate or open place) of Ahmadi is a very wide pass, about three and a half miles long, bounded by precipitous cliffs rising to 300 feet. It forms one of the Hood courses for the water collected in the mountain-ringed plains above. The water finds its way into the Tang-i-Zindan by way of the Ahmadi river. Emerging from the Lard-i- Ahmadi into a saucer-like plain, it is seen that the main drain age from the watershed runs out almost due E. in the direc tion of the Kuh-i-Ahmadi, which towers into the sky on the right above the village.

After about miles it drops into the bed of ndld, banks having this time become some 30 or 40 feet high. From here road goes along the stony bed of ndld, hills gradually closing in on it, and passes to right of precipitious, flat-topped hill. Road, where possible, leaves the bed and ascends the banks. Guns, however, would have to stick to the bed. It would be a heavy bit of work for them in any case. After a tiresome march of 13 miles Abid or Ab-i-Bid is reached. The ascent is very consi derable all the way, amounting to 1,660 feet. Here there is a small serai. There is a large willow tree on the rising ground, and from all over this bit of ground near the tree water oozes out, making little running streams. On the whole, there is a very fair supply, more than ample for all caravans, and the water itself is good. The dasht is much more like the Afghan ones, having vegetation on it. Leave Kerman road at 17 miles; at 18| miles there are hills to left, distant about a mile. Continuing the descent, Haur is reached at 21 miles. It consists of eight houses inhabited by soldiers (all these vil lages were placed as guards against the Baluchis), and a large piece of cultivation sloping down to the stream, also an orchard. The vegetation is richer after Abid. Haxir is on the left bank of the stream which flows through Sar-i-Apsh. It had a con siderable volume (April), but to the E. there are no more vil lages, and the stream is lost in a kavir. 37 south-east. Road runs up valley, t-VRoute No. X.ll(k)—contd.
