A/C. I have to put before your (Janab) honour that I previously informed you about the complaint of Hamad bin Abdulla ash 3harqi (sahib) head of Fujairah against the ^awasim baqur and his party, for which they have no reason. Again another complaint has reached us, and he is (head of Fujairah) an independent bhaikhi with his party. it is requested from baqur to refrain from his opposition, for which he has no way. He (Shaikh of Fujairah) received threats from an-Nayib (agent) Abdul uatif. it is hoped tiiat your (oanab) honour will instruct him to refrain from and not to oppose him and you are the source of justice.British Residency and Consul ate-General 9 Bushire,14th Apri1 , 1902* i To His Highness Sejyed Feisal bin Turki Suloan of Muscat. V ** A/C. Our friend Major Cox t has showed me your Highness ’s letter to him y about the Sheikh of Fujtyrah’s complaint, and we have talked owjthe matter. I must inform Your Highness that in the year 1881 ,in the time of Colonel Ross this same Sheikh Homed bin Abdulla entered into a written agreement under which y he admitted his dependence on the Sheikh Salim bin Sul tan, Chi ef of Shargah,and this writing is on record in this Residency. The claim of Hamed bin Abdulla,that he is an independent Sheikh,cannot therefore be sustained,for there is no doubt about his position in relation to the Jowasmee. At the same time from informati on / whi ch I had previously received from the Chief of Debay and my Agent of Shargah,it seems/not probable that the Sheikh of Fujtyrah,may have some grounds of complaint against some ofof Sheikh Suqqur's Jowasmee subjects, and I am writing to Sheikh Suqqur in this matter and OLTn^informing him that it is his duty to protect the inhabitants of Fujtyrah from oppressi on and give redress when they complain to him, so that they will not have any need or excuse for appealing to fri ends from outside. If the Sheikh of Fujtyrah is still with your High ness,! trust you will explain to him the state of the case,and that he will not receive any encouragement from your Highness either pecuniary or otherwise,m maintain- ^ V * ing a quarrel with the Chief of Shargah,with whose friendship his interests chiefly lie. % I have to thank your Highness for your kind message through Major Cox.

As ordered in your letter No 116 dated 21st April 1902 1 informed the Chief of Shargah that you hoped he had before; him the purport of your letter dated 3rd February 1902,and that he would treat his subjects kindly and that you would not see his rights interfered with. But it seems to me that the offensive and defensive alliance made between the Chiefs of Shargah ana Abu Dhabi has the following object The Sheikh of Shargah makes over to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi his territorial riahts in Zamra and agrees to render assistance in the erection of buildings there. In return for this,the Chief of Shargah has asked for the assistance t of the Chief of Abu Dhabi in bringing the Headman of Fujeir*, under his authority without giving any handle to the Chief of Debai who claims to protect the Headman of Fujeira against the attacks of the Mazariyeh tribe who are subject- to Shargah - HflByMMMJ% Shargah. The Chiefs of Shargah and Abu Dhabi have come to an understanding about this . The Chief of Abu Dhabi has told the Sheikh of Behai that if the Headman of ^ujeira took refuge with him, the Headman may be sent to him,so that he may sena him to Shargah:that they ( the Chi eft of Shargah ana Abu Dhabi) would deal with the Headman as they liked:that if the Headman did not agree to the course,the Chief of Debai should hold himself aloof and not combine vnth him (the Heaaman). It appears to me that the Chief of Debai is not willing to make over the Headman of ^ujeira to the Chief of Abu Dhabi on this sort of condition,neither is he toil ling to hold himself aloof from the Headman after the ill-treatment he has received from the Cazariyeh while he was under his (the Chief of Debai's) protection. * A- No ■1 of 1902.

(2) The village and Fort of Fujaireh are about a mile and half from the coast. The of the village at the coast is tf ' flag Gharfah, and at the time of our arrival the Towasmee^was flying at Gh rfah and the Arab flag over Fujaireh Fort. The Shaikh of the Sharkiyeen- Hamad bin Abdulla- had returned from Muscat a few days before and on seeing the Redbreast approach had come down to Gharfah to meet me. I had a long conversation with him, informing him of what had passed between yourself and me on the subject of his attitude, and of the agreement of 1881 signed by himself, which was record in the Residency office. /V Shaikh Hamad replied that he remembered the document but would not admit that it applied to fujaireh itself, which he said was excepted from the agreement*. I insisted that the writing must be held to apply to himself and all villages control ed by him. (3) Questioned about the statement which he had made to me in Muscat as to the part taken by Seyyid Feisal in main taining the garrison of Fujaireh Fort, Shaikh Hamad at firstalleged that this had been the custom from the time that Seyyid Mahomed bin Turki brother of the Sultan, was INali at 3ohar,in his fathers time, but I was unable to obtain any definite figures from him, and eventually elicited the fact that Seyyid Feisal f s pecuniary assistance consisted of nothing more than a present of cash and sundries on the occasion of Hamad f s visit.?to Muscat* The 20 men who garrison Fujaireh Fort are from his own tribe, the Sharkiyeen. (4) Asked what specific causes of complaint he had against the chief of Shargah or his subjects, he stated (a) Last year some LIngah visitors to Fujaireh were looted between Fujaireh and Shargfih by^A^vamir and Beni K^t^a b^ ^ tribesmen, subject to 9 Sharga^ Ham id^ went to ^ r\ Shaikh Suggar to obtain redress, but was told he could obtain redress from them himself if he was so advised and would get no assistance from Shargah* He then applied to iSlebai and Muscat* The former promised to remontrate with the offenders himself* Shaikh Suggar heard this and there - upon incited some of the Muzariyeh to molest Fujaireh people and they shortly afterwards killed a Sharki &lt;xyy\ - and stole his camel and rifles * He again wrote to /-\ Debai and Muscat-* and both enjoined on him not to retaliate * Since then the Muzariyeh ha~'e killed ano ther Sharki and looted 3 camels * but he, Hamad, has done nothing in the way of retaliation* (lb) Shaikh Suggar has forcibly absorbed the E^iyfcleh section of the Sharkiyeen who used to pay ^akat at Fujetir^l^i and he has made them divert their goods to Kalbeh where he has a Vlali* (5) The foregoing was Shaikh Hamad 1 s story* In conclusion I assured him that you were giving attention to -his case and would insist on Shaikh Suggar treating him with consideration and justice, at the same time I impressed upon-him that his interests lay®,, lay in coming to a modus vivendi with Shargah and that he would only h&amp;rfli his own case, by raising his tribesmen A and attempting any retaliation. lU-(ytc&amp;d- He promised me that he^continue to be patient and^vould itqV take otnjr hostile measures, but he seemed ~ery nnwi 1 1 1 ng.

Bus hi re , October 1902. To, The Political Agent, M a s k a t . Sir, I am directed to forward for your informati on a precis of a report received from the Residency Agent at Shargah relative to recent actions of the Shahiyeen. 2. It appears that the Shahiyeen are in the wrong f as they were not entitled to erect towers in villages which are subordinate to Shargah.- S. The Resident has endeavoured to effect an amico.- -ble settlement between the Chieftain of Shargah and the Headman of Fujeira, but the latter is unwilling to listen to any reasonable proposals or to come under a guarantee of safe conduct to Shargah to have his case heard and his . grievances remedied* 4. As his attitude is evidently due to the expecta- -tion of support from other quarters in the event of Shaikh Suggar proceeding to coerce him and as it is understood the Shahiyeen are now generally regarded as subjects of the Sultan of Mas cat f the Resident will be obliged if you will moveIf move Mis Highness So send orders co them to vacate the * towers, and to refrain from interfering in matters which concern ‘Fu/jeira and Shargah. Pol i ti cal Res ident i n the * Persian Gulf*Precis of Peport from Sharaoh Agent. Zed-el-Helali, heed of the Shahiyeen, who are subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, resident at Baiya in Bohat Dabba, has erected two towers in Ghoneh village and one in Medha. Both of these villages are subordinate to Shargah'Ond it seems that the Shahiyeen headman's action is by way of support to Fujeira against any coercion by his suzerain of Shargah. In former times the Shahiyeen considered themr- -selves tributary to Abu Dhabbi and used to seek the pro- -tection of that Shaikh against Jowasmi oppression, so Shaikh Suggar complained to Shaikh Zaeed of Zed's action. The latter Shaikh informed the Shahiyeen that if they still considered themselves under his protection they must quit the towers or he would have nothing to do with them. Zed refused to relinquish the attitude he had taken up. Shaikh Suggar thereupon declared bis intention of march -ing to punish the Shahiyeen and called upon Shaikh Zaeed to join him in accordance with the treaty existing between them.To, Lt-Gol C.A.KEMBALL, I.S.C. POL: RE3DT: in the Persian Gulf; BU3HIRE. Dated Muscat 4th November 1902. I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.127 dated 20th October 1902 relative to the recent action acti-Qg of the 3hahiyocn of Baiya. 2. While I was away in H.M.3. ,? Amphitrito ,f during the hot weather, some of the 3hahiyeen or 3hihooh came to Muscat and I believe were the bearers of a letter from the 3haikh of Debai to the 3ultan their object being perhaps to get some recognition or support from him. His Highness assured me in this connection that he had not given them the slightest en couragement and had sent them empty away. Again, a few weeks ago as I gathered from a private letter from you from 3hiraz, that the Fujeirah 3haikh was still giving you trouble, I mentioned the fact in conversation with the 3ultan and he remarked ,f the man must be a fool to persist in his attitude, after being distinctly given to understand that it would not hold water ,f or words to that effect. 3. On receiving your letter under reply I again communi cated with him on the subject. He then begged that it would not be thought that he had had any dealings with them and assured me that since the position had been explained to him last yc^r he had held altogether aloof from the quarrel. He has now forwarded to me two letters - one addressed to 3haikhs 3uleiman bin Mahomed and 3uleiman bin Mubarak and all the Shaikhs of the Shihooh and a second to Shaikh Zed el Hilali;which I think it best to enclose in this letter as they will * probably reach their destination quicker by this means, ^ I trust that their purport will be found sufficient for the purpose.

In continuation of my telegram Bo. 104, dated the 22nd April 1925, I have the honou* to suljmit the foil- zoning report on the subject of the misdemeanours! of the Sharqi Shaikh, liossmd bln /bdullah, headman of Fujairah, and of the recent meaeures taken by me to get him punished* 2. In 1901 this Shaikh, \rto is nominally a feudatory of the Shaikh of Gharr&amp;h, refused to take orders from his suzerain and asserted his independence. The dasiml Shaikh was not strong enough to coerce Ills turbulent subject and the position has remaintid unaltered since then. Colonel (now Sir F.2. ) Co? once visited Mijalrah and warned Shaikh Hfunad to walk warily. his advice, until recent*! -ly he seems to have followed, and the l eelGency has hud no j occasion to complain of his conduct until recently. 3. Some months ago I received a complaint through the 'olitical Agent,Muscat, from a ^luch woman residing in the ult&amp;n v s dominions that heVdaughter had baen kidnapped, taken to Fujalrsii and sold to Shaikh Hamad. 1 he latter was consequently oallmion, through the Shaikh of ham^ah, to restore the girl. He gave two insolent replies, denying in the first that the girl was with him and adding that he recognised no superior but God; in the second he statedstated, after fr»ro#f» of the girl having been there had been, comoiunloated to him, that the girl had died* , I loft the matter oyer for dls^sal during x^y winter visit to the Irucial Coast. 4. In the comae of my recent tour in the n.I.U.s. 'Lawrence' 1 arranged to vie it i&gt;\ijairaiA. he Benior Laval Officer in H.U.3. 'Triad* was at Muscat, and H.M.S. 'Cyclamen' was at Kenjam. b. Un my arrival at Ghailoh (halba) Shaikh Calcl bin Hamad, the local representative of the Chief of Chargah, came on board the 'Lawrence” to see me, and i returned his visit ashore. He is the father-in-law of both .holid bin Ahr/iad, e&gt;-^ haikh of *harguh, and ajomA bin Abdullah of Pujairah. he proviaed donkeys for wy two Arab aeslet- -ants, the Fesidenoy Agent, thargaii, and -han Fahttour Haji Abdur Haz^aq to ride over to i^airah, about five miles distant, in order that fhaikh Hamad might be asked to visit me the following day when the 'Lawrence” anchored off Ghafralfah, hie coastal village, as 1 had some business to settle with him. 6. 1 asked Shaikh Laid if he knew anything about 'the Baluch girl: he replied 'It is said that she died.' From other sources 1 huvo reason to suspect that Shaikh Hamad sold her to Bedouin of the interior and that he found himself unable to get her buck. 7. i halkh Bald also told mo that Bhalkh Hamad was unlikely to 9bey my summons. i therefore asked the Senior H&amp;v&amp;l Officer by wire loos telegraph to Join me. 8. • huikh Hamad replied to say message the same night that he would not oomo on board the 'Lawrence' and that 1 must meet him asnore. 9. It is a rule wellknown to all the I haikhs of the ruclal Coast, and a custom which has been in force for very many yeare that, whenever the 'Lawrence' flying the Resident'sflu#;, onchoro off ». port, the loc&amp;l ; halkh mufjt at onoe oome off to the »hip. practice the i haikhe of the Trucial Coast generally alao pay the first visit to the Commander of a w^an-of-v^ar. 10. Next morning isrhen we had reached ( halraifah, the Chaikh sent me a message that if 1 sent him a letter of safe-conduct, he would come on board. ’/his I did, but he then changed his mind. 1 then sent my 3©cretary ashore to see him, and to promise to remain on shore while the Shaikh was visiting me. ’his w^.u also of no avail, and my Secretary reported that the Shaikh's attitude was so truculent and obstinate as to leave no hope of a change in his demeanour, though he expressed his willingness to pay a fine for the girl. 11. In my opinion to have given way at this stage of the proceedings to the haikh over the metier of the visit would have seriously undermined the Pesident's authority over all the inhabitants of the Arab Trucial Coast. &amp;o long as our interffits have not been directly affected, we have allowed the tharqiyin Shaikh to continue quietly in his attitude of insubordination, though he has in fact terrorised the people of Challah and }hor Fakkan, which i still are governed by a Vail (representative) and cousin of the Chief of : hargah. Now he had in effect claimed that the customs and regulations imposed by long usage on the Iruclal Chiefs and their subordinate officials do not apply to him. It was obvious^iiis Majesty*8 Government could not allow this claim to go unnoticed, as it would remove fvom the control of the Peeident a district containing 12. he 'Cyclamen' reached charalfah first and Cowanander Baker, after an interview with me, informed the Senior Naval Officer of my views.

The Shaikh of Kalha »id t e Fujaira emissary having said their say, departed from Sahar for their rival camps. The Sultan at this stage despaired of peace, hut •* his attitude v.as one of unconcern. No Unseat interest, he said, would he daiaaged h the euarrel takiag its normal course: he vas in no sense ambitious to arhit ate.

T; e Shaikh of Fujaira cordially invited us to visit Fujaira and he his guests. That same evening the Chaikh of Kalha arrived and pressed a similar invitation upon us to visit Falha. H.H. replied that so long as discord divided them he would decline their hospit lity.

The issues in the dispute were raainly two (I) the insistence “by Fujaira that Kalha has no ’’harau' i.e., is an isolated t.ovm withou-c rights to adjacent territory. (L) the Sanctuary readily afforded “by one .Shaikh to the enewies of the other Shaikh. What led up to the collision in Bawadhan was “briefly as folio s. \ raan of some standing “belonging to Kalha “becawe discontented with the treatment he received at the hands of the I alba -haikh. He thereupon “betook himself to Fujaira where he soon enjoyed the favour of the hhaikh of his new domicile. His subsequent “business visits to Kalha he mad occasions for vilifying the Kalha hhaikh. The latter suffered it for a time “but finally turned him out of Kalha and forbade him ever to return. This roused the ire of the Fujaira Shaikh under whose protection he vas mow living. .1 “bloodless vendetta ensued : each hhaikh “boycotted the followers of the otj er and forbade then fishin or diving in his waters. Meanwhile the hhaikh of la Kaltoa “built a M godown ,, in a garden on the road to Fujaira: and the Fujaira Shaikh Shaikh conceiving it to “be a veiled fort, s.i ote and destroyed.it, alleging at the sane time that Kalba had no right, in any case, to “build outside town limits. See {i j above. This was the signal for hostilities. Military defence works were taken in hand “by Kalba, and the forces of Fu.jaira caiae down and invested the gardens close “b w The u: ual arah warfare took place and b a kind of poetic justice one of the three casualties was the Falba deportee, 1 ho seems to have “been the “ I utaharrak”. ^ - H.J ’s enquiries persuaded him that the cause of the . “ *as per aps not - 0 e found in these incidehto. • incid nts iniaBdisitely leading up to the fight in , hut to deep ueated ill will.
