I received 9th May 1948. SECRET. Para 10 of Chancery letter of March 24th about Continental Shelf of Persian Gulf. In our reply to State Department we propose to accept suggestion that some public announcement by ourselves and U.S. Government on general lines will be needed. We have come to the conclusion however that if this public announcemeiit were made as envisaged by State Department before rulers on south-western shores of Persian Gulf had made any formal assertion of sovereignty an opportunity would be afforded to Persian Government to take forestalling action and to claim continental shelf of whole of Gulf. On reflection we therefore consider and propose to suggest to State Department that as soon as H.M.G. and U.S. Govt* have settled their policy the first public action by anyone should be a declaration of sovereignty in general terms by the rulers of the south-western shores of the Persian Gulf. This would mean that we and Americans would suggest this course to Saudi and Iraqi Governments and that we should arrange for Sheikhdoms under our protection and Muscat to make general assertion of sovereignty over area of continental shelf bet?/een median line and limit of their territorial waters. We would try to persuade Saudi and Iraq.1 Governments to synchronize their action with that of the Sheikhdoms. H.M.G. and U.^S. - / Govt.Govt, could immediately after make an announcement of their policy. 2. As far as action by Arab Sheikhdoms is concerned we think that this shot-id take the form of a formal proclamation or law by the rulers covered by a declaration by H.J.G. that the rulers' ptoclamation is made with the full assent and approval of H.M.G. We would supply you with the necessary formula. The declarations of sovereignty would be in very general terms and-fact that there are so many undefined land frontiers in the area would not matter at this stage. 3. This means that we have been obliged reluctantly not to accept the recommendation in para 4 of your despatch 448-S February 21st to Commonwealth Relations Office. Fact is that London offices of several of the Oil Companies are showing interest in continental shelf of Persian Gulf and wex are under considerable pressure to tell them on what lines we think continental shelf of Persian Gulf ought to be divided. There is thus likely to be ? competlon forvconcessions at a very early date and definition and public declaration of principles which HtM.G. and U.S. Govt, think should be adopted cannot be mpch longer deferred. And as stated in para 1 above we consider it would be dangerous to mafce a public announcement before sovereignty has been asserted by rulers of south western shores of Gulf. 4. We therefore hope that you will be able to agree to the course which we propose to suggest to State Department. 5. Xs we should like to send our reply to them as soon as possible we should be grateful for a very urgent telegraphic reply. - S/S for Foreign Affairs -p COPY —^ / Telegram Inter Indiv (CYPHER TELEGRAM - CTP - SECRET) Political Resldent f Bahrain, Foreign Office, London, From To No. 60 Dated the 12th May 1948, Secret, 2. Your telegram No, 68 dated May 8th. Chancery letter of March 24th on Continental Shelf of Persian Gulf has not been received 3. In view of what is stated in paragraph 3 I have nothing more to say except that it will not be easy to make Trucial Shaikhs understand whit is required of them and that in view of their number and the distances by which they are separated the process of explaining the matter to them and getting declarations issued will take some time. Some difficulty may be experienced with the Shaikh of Bahrain who will take the opportunity of venting fcx his grievances over Zubarah and the recent decision about the sea bed between Bahrain and Qatar, 4, In framing the proposed formula the ownership of islands will presumably be borne in mind for instance Hulul Island which lies off Qatar is recognised as belonging to Abu Dhabi while the Tamb Islands which lie nearer the Persian than the Arab shore are claimed by us for Ras al Khaimah, HAY/ 4 . S-S C R E T (C) COPY FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I, 24th Hay, 1948. (E 6276/276/91) SECRET . Dear Chancery, Will you please refer to your letter No. G 59/-/48 of the 24th March about the principles to be adopted for the territorial division of the waters of the Persian Gulf and the exploitation of off-shore oil. We are very glad to find that In general the State Departments thinking is on the same lines as our own. In giving you our further observat ions on the State Department's preliminary views, we think it would be convenient if we referred in each c a se to the para graphs as numbered in your letter. 2. Paragraph 3 of your letter presents no difficulties as the State Department agree with our view that existing concessions do not cover after acquired territory unless this is expressly provided for in the terms of the concession. 3. Your paragraph 4. Two things are Involved here, the assertion of sovereignty by the rulers over the sea-bed and sub-soil of the areas wfcich would fall to their shares, and the grant of rights to exploit the oil in the sub-soil. On the first point our view is that the rulers should annex the sea-bed when they annex the sub-soil. We do not see how they can very well do one without the other. A different sovereignty over the sufface from the sub-soil is hardly tenable. As regards the second point, the Amerlcanx view ± as we understand it is that the right to exploit the sub-soil does not include a right to make any use of the sea-bed above and that nothing the oil companies do in the sub-soil must prejudice the existence of the fisheries or pearling beds on the sea-bed above it; In principle, we agree and we think that navigation rights must be similarly protected. This point will present no difficulty in the case of new concessions or in the case of those companies whose concessions do not include the continental shelf territory. In the few cases where existing concessions will include the continental shelf after it has been annexed by the State concerned, it will, however, have to be made clear to the companies that whatever their theoretical rights they shall only exploit the sub-soil provided they reppect the sea bed above it and navigation rights in the sea. It will also probably be necessary to issue rules and regulations similar to those which we understand have been Issued by the States of Texas and LoulMana to control exploaatory methods in off-shore areas in the Gulf of Mexico and likewise something on the lines of the Trinidad Submarine Regulations for the protection of shipping, an extract from which we enclose. This is, however, a detail which can be settled at a later date.4, Your paragraph 5. We hope that the map sent with our letter No, E, 4457/276/91 of the 12th April will have been of assistance to the State Department in showing our conception of how the geographical dividfon of the sea-bed of the Persian Gulf by a median line between the North-Eastern and North-Western shore of the Gulf would look on a map. As regards the transversal division, we feel that the most practical way would be to extend d towards the median line the boundaries of the territorial waters between adjacent States except where this is clearly inequitable. We appreciate the necessity for some such arrangement as that suggested by the State Department to meet the difficulties of disputed land frontiers. We think, however, that it would be unwise to decide now upon a settled practice as regards sea areas corresponding to land areas in dispute, as much will obviously depend on the areas in which the oil companies show interest. In so far v as the sea areas off the Truclal Coast sheikhdoms are concerned, the problem will be largely one for us to settle and we have asked the Political Resident for an appreciation ofi the possibility of an early settlement of the disputed boundaries. As regards areas in dispute between Saudi Arabia and the Sheikhdoms under our protection, we agree with you that it would be better to have some sort of self-denying ordinance. In the case of the neutral zone between Kowelt and Saudi Arabia, we do not anticiapte any difficulty as it can presumably be arranged that just as Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Kowelt hold jointly the rights over the neutral zone on land, the rights over the corresponding area of the sea-bed could be shared jointly, 5, We are glad to see from paragraph 8 of your letter that tht State Department agree with us that sovereignty over those parts of the sea-bed where it is desired to grant concessions should be asserted by the States concerned. In the case of the Arab sheikhdoms, we think this should take the form of a formal proclamation or a law by the ruler covered by a declaration on the part of His Majesty’s Government that the ruler’s proclamation is made with the full assent and approval of His Majesty’s Government, We have in mind that the ruler's proclamation should be an assertion of sovereignty in general terms over the sea-bed between the median line and the limit of territorial waters. In some cases Islands be longing to one State lie nearer to the shore of another State and the proclamations would have to tkke this into account, 6, Your paragraph 7, There is a difference of opinion between us and the State Department over the approach to Persia, We have made it clear in the first paragraph of our telegram No* 4135 of the 15th April to you that in our view acceptance of the State Department’s suggestion in your paragraph 7 might result in the whole dlvlsSbn of the sea-bed on the Arab side of the Gulf being held up. We are convinced that it is essential because of the Persian claim to Bahrein that we should present the Persians with a fait accompli . Any other course would, we feel sure, lead to endless arguments and prevent us dealing with the problems which have already arisen due to the Interest shown by certain oil companies in exploiting off-shore oil Jun on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf, We hope that the State Department will be able to agree to our views in this matter, Tehrah telegram No, 342 of the 27th April supports this view./ 10 - 3 - t j 7. As regards the future procedure mentioned in you paragraph 9, the negotiations which certain oil companies have already started with the Saudi Arabian Government have, we feel, forced our hand over the Continental Shelf and the principles of our ^oint approach must clearly be settled as soon as possible. We think that any attempt to settle the disputed boundaries before we informed the rulers of the Arab States,and we and the United States Government Jointly or in concert infommed the Governments of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, would hold up proceedings indefinitely. / 8. On the further question of the action to be taken once Anglo-American policy has been defined, we are of the opinion that, if His Majesty*s Government and the United States Government were to make a public accouncement as suggested, be fore the rulers concerned had made a formal assertion of sovereignty, an opportunity Y/ould be afforded to the Persian Government to take forestalling action. To prevent this we feel that the first public action should be the declaration of sovereignty by the rulers. This would mean that we and the Americans would suggest this course to the Saudi Arabians and Iraqis and that we should arrange for the Sheikhdoms under our protection and Miixtsx Muscat to make a general assertion of sovereignty over the area of the continental shelf between the median line and the limit of their territorial waters. In the case of the 'rucial Sheikhs the process of explaining what is required of them and getting the required declarations Issued may take some little time. &lt;Ve are looking into this question further but are inclined to think that some delay on their account is probably inevitable since they would in any case have to be told what was proposed for them. His Majesty's Government and the United States Government could immediately after make an announcement of their policy in the matter. • We think it is unlikely that this procedure would favour some companies more than others. In their own interest the rulers will not grant additional concessions without giving full opportunity to all comers to make their bids. 9. The State Department have also asked whether His Majesty's Government have finally adopted or are likely to adopt the principle of the Continental Shelf for sea-bed areas in general. We cannot commit ourselves to a definite assurance that we should follow this principle In all cases which might aflse in future, which are infinitely varied. We have, however, followed this doctrine in the two cases that have a risen in the Bahamas and Majaica and are proposing to apply it in the Western Atlantic and the Persian Gulf. For your information, we should not be able to give a more definite acceptance of the principle without consulting the ^ Commonwealth Governments. We, of course, mean the principle as originally expressed in President Truman's proclamation which, when property applied, has the effect of excluding from any division at all the sea-bed where the sea is is so deep that so far as can be seen at present there is no practical teason for dividing it and not the extensions of this principle which have been put forward by various Latin-American States, extensions against which we have in most cases formally protested. (10• On the question of the association of Service advisers, we have kept in full consultation throughout with the Admiralty which, we consider, is the Department chiefly concerned and shall continue to do so. In fact, their hydrographer drew up the chart which we sent you. We presume that the State Department will have similarly consulted their Navy Department. 11. We should be grateful if you would discuss these comments informally with the State Department. We would like you to g telegraph the results of this discussion as if they are in general agreement with the approach suggested in our despatch of the 4th February as modified and explained in this letter, it will be necessary for us, in view of the^ever- increasing interest now being shewn in off-shore oil in the Persian Gulf to seek higher authority as speedily as possible for this line to be adopted as our official policy. They will no doubt wish k to do likewise. Once the British and American policies are settled we should hope that action on the lines of our paragraph 7 above would follow fairly speed ily unless some particular twist of the Palestine or Persian situations made it advisable to hold b&amp;clu 12.

Eastern Departments letter E.6276/276/91 of 24th May. Offshore oil in Persian Gulf. State Department were not ready to discuss the question until 16th June when meeting was held with Loy Henderson, petroleum and legal experts and State Department geographer. In following paragraphs references are to paragraphs in Eastern Departments letter. 2. Paragraph 2. State Department adhere to agreed view and consider that any dispute regarding the territory covered by concessions should be settled between the Government and the concessionaire concerned. 3. Paragraphs 3 and 6. State Departments views on the assertion of sovereignty differ from yours. They do not consider that a claim to oil in the subsoil necessarily means that the bottom of the sea must be within the sovereignty of the country concerned; nor do they consider that sovereignty should in fact be asserted over the sea-bed. On the analogy of air rights over national territory such a claim might lead to an assertion of sovereignty over the sea above the sea-bed, and hence to interfer ence with free navigation. State Department pointed out that in tfe the Truman declaration no claAms were asserted over the sea-bed of the continental shelf. Moreover the assertion of sovereignty over the sea-bed in the present case might, in their opinion, give rise to serious political complications concerning navigational rights if used as a precedent in other parts of the world. 4, In the Truman declaration, the word ”sovereignty” was intentionally avoided, and the word ”Jurisdiction” was used instead - although with much the same meaning in mind. The State Depart ment would therefore prefer that the'States concerned should assert their jurisdiction over the natural resources in the subsoil of the areas allotted to them. It was pointed out to the State Department that the maim object was to prevent exploitation of the subsoil resources of the Persian Gulf by undesirable countries but they thought that their proposal would suffice for this purpose. They recognised nevertheless that the question of jurisdiction over the x activities of persons drilling for oil outside territorial waters might be difficult. Once oil had been struck and production started the jurisdiction over these activities might, they thought, revert to the State granting the concession. This was however a legal point to which they had given little consideration. /6. The State •••■■ ■ ■ 2 5. The State Department agreed with Eastern Department’s comments on the second point discussed in paragraph 3 of their letter, 6. Paragraph 4, The State Department geographer produced a map which together with an explanatory memorandum, is being sent by bag. He emphasised that it was drawn with the object of giving the divisions of the area a strictly scientific basis and that although there would no doubt have to be divergencies for political reasons from the boundaries suggested, it would be advantageous, in dealing with the States concerned to start from some clearly logical principle. His map would, in our view, need considerable changes if it is to be acceptable to the States concerned. If his principled were adopted further information would be needed about the status of some islands, the sovereignty over which is undefined or disputed. 7. Paragraph 6. In spite of our strong representations to the contrary the State Department still adhere to the view that it would be wiser not to face the Persian Government with a mi accompli. This would, in their view, encourage anti-British and anti-American element in Persian and would engender in the Persian Government a lack of confidence in both our Governments even if they did not learn of our intentions in advance through a leakage*. 8. • The State Department suggest therefore that after consult ation with his British colleague, the United States Ambassador in Tehran might advise the State Department whether in his opinion it would be desirable to discuss the question privately with the Shah on a suitable occasion. He would explain the position, say that the British and United States Governments did not desire to stir up trouble in dealing with this urgent question, and ask the Shah suggestions as to how the matter might be settled without raising political difficulties. He would point out that an orderly and rapid solution was as in the interests of Persia as of any fcther country, since the Persians could hardly wish to see Soviet concern! drilling in the Gulf. Any agitation would only help the Soviet Government to stir up trouble and the latter would have no chance of doing this if the Persian Government were prepared to acquiesce in the proposed division. If the matter were raised It could be suggested to the Shah that the Persian Government could reserve their 'rights” to Bahrain whilst accepting the proposals themselves, If the Shah refused to agree in spite of these arguments, he would be told that the British and American Governments intended to go ahead anyway in view of the urgency of the problem. &gt; This compromise suggestion would, in the State Department's view, ensure vj that the proposals were not held up whilst at the same time giving the Persian Government no excuse for saying that they had not been consulted by two supposedly friendly governments in a matter in which they had a considerable interest. 9. A similar approach could also be made by His Majesty's representative, although in the State Department's opinion it might be preferable, in view of our own interest in Bahrain and Kuwait, to leave this to the United States Ambassador who would, of course, keep in close touch with His Majesty's Embassy. Henderson hoped tt that you would be prepared to give serious consideration to his suggestions. He emphasised the State Department's concern that we should not go behind the back of the Persian Government by saying that even if the United States Ambassador in Tehran agreed with the views so far expressed by His Majesty's Embassy there, the State Department might feel obliged to overrule him. 10. Paragraph 7. State Department agree. They think that the companies concerned might be asked to observe a self-denying ordinance in any disputed areas in which oil might exist. 11 11. Paragraph 8. This is largely covered by the State Department's comments on paragraphs 5 and 6. In their view the first public eifction should be the assertion of jurisdiction by the States concerned over the natural resources in the subsoil of the areas allotted to them.12. Paragraph 10. State Department have not yet talked to the United States service representatives but propose to do so now. We are keeping the British Joint Staff Mission informed. 13. We told the State Department of the position as regards the Anglo-American concern which is interested in the Saudi Arabian continen/tal shelf (see Burrow*s letter to Balfour E 5919/276/91 of the 18th May)• They have been asking the Superior Oil Company to go slow but have not yet been successful in restraining them and are consequently having difficulties with theArabian-American Oil Compai The State Department*s latest information from Jedda is that King Ibn Saud may may now be proposing to grant a concession very shortly to the Anglo American concern in spite of a recent undertaking by the deputy Minister of Finance that no concession would be granted outside territorial waters without the concurrence of the British and American Governments. We asked whether an approach by His Majesty*s Government to the King would be useful. They are holding consultations with Aramco officials who have Just returned from Saudi Arabia, and after this will have a clearer picture of develop ments in this area. 14. Henderson emphasised that the development mentioned in the preceding paragraph made it imperative that His Majesty’s Gover nment and the United States Government should reach a very rapid decision on these matters. He thought it might be desirable in the circumstances for an American official to proceed to London or a British official to Washington. He asked us to obtain your views on this and on the other points raised as urgently as possible.

Ref: GS9/-/48 SgPPEl 24th March, 1948. Dear Department, Please refer to Foreign Office despatch No.153 (E 1478/276/ 91) of the 4th February about the question of exploiting oil lying under the seabed of the Persian Gulf, but outside the territorial watees of the states bordering on the Gulf. 2. The State Department have spent some time considering the matter, but a meeting has just been held with members of its Near Eastern and Petroleum Divisions, at which our Petroleum Attache was also present. ft this *4ae the State Department officials concern ed expressed the view that in general the Foreign Office*s line of approach was very useful and sensible one, and they gave us their preliminary and informal observations under the following five headings: (a) The position of existing coneessions. (Paragraph 7 of the despatch). (b) Should seabed add subsoil rights be dealt with together, or should the latter be tackled in isolation ? (Paragraph 2 of the despatch)• (c) The question of the median line and the projection thereto of land frontiers and that of the probable Persian attitude. (Paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of the despatch). (d) The assertion of sovereignty. (Paragraph 4 of the despatch). (e) Fa*** Future procedure (paragraph 5 of the despatch). 3. Their views on (a) are that existing concessions do not cover after-acquired territory unless this ■ is expressly provided foijdn the concession. 4. On (b) they consider that there are two ways of dealing with the point. The first is to hold that only subsoil rights are now in question, ignoring for the present seabed (and fishing) rights, and to arrange for any assertion of sovereignty to relate to subsoil rights only. The second is to assert both subsoil and seabed rights, but to make any reservations which may be necessary for acquired seabed rights. They are inclined to prefer the first alternative as being simpler, with some clause indicating that sub soil rights should not be exercised to such detriment of seabed rights as might be caused, for example, feu* by drilling in pearl beds or by contamination of the waters on fishing banks by oil. If these problems were in fact to arise, arrangements might be made ad hoc? for compensation to be paid. 5. They think that the conception of the median line, with the extension of land frontiers to meet it. is a sound one. Where there are disputed land frontiers it might be possible to make a 'neutral” zone in the sea areas corresponding to the land areas in dispute, in which there could be joint rights or no rights at all. These areas could be allocated whpn a decision is reached on the land areas concerned. It occurs to us that, if this idea were adopted, it would be better to have no exploitation at all, rather than joint rights, since if oil were found in the sea areas, the conflict over the land frontiers would become even more acute. 6. Their tentative idea about the projection of a land frontier where the angle at which the frontier intersects the coastline is in doubt, Is that it might be drawjtfmt to the Median Line perpendic ular to the general trend of the coast at the point in question. But it was realised that this might, in practice, be difficult, and that no decision could be reached unless it could be seen how such aconception would look on the map. The State Department officials therefore asked us if you would be good enough to provide us with a map on which the situation as you see it would be sketched, Much on the lines of the map which was enclosed in your letter to us E 9787/716/91 of the 21st November last about the boundaries between Bahrain and Qatar. I* ^n the rersian aspect of the problem, their tentative ideas were rather different to yours. The Iran Section of the State Department suggested that, in spite of recent excitement over Bahrain, the question might not really be fundamental importance to Persia*. They were inclined to believe that more trouble might be caused by enabling the Persians to say that the states on the south-western ahore of the Gulf, backed by the United Kingdom and the United States, had '$wung a fast one on them”, than would be caused if all the states concerned, Including Persia, were approach ed at the same time. The Persian Government would certainly make some fuss, but the Iran Section felt that they might possibley accept the idea in the end, perhaps with a reservation that their acceptance must not be taken to prejudice their claims. The other states, if they accept the scheme need not agree with any Persian reservations. The State Department officials concerned expressed the view that the Persian Claim to Bahrain was very weak, but suggested that it was more likely to be remitted by the Persian Government to some international authority if the Persians felt that they had been M bounced”. If this view were accepted, the question of timing would be of less importance since'Persia would be informed at the same time as the other states. We pointed out the difficulties which you foresee - and the additional one that a Persian refusal, under their proposal, might prejudice the whole scheme. They emphasised that their views on this point were personal and were Intended simply for discussion. 8. On the question whether sovereignty over those parts of the seabed where it was desired to grant concessions should be asserted ^ by the states concerned, the State Department share the views exp ressed in para 4 of the Foreign Office despatch under reference, and they think therefore, that this should be done. ' 9. On future procedure, the State Department consider that when the principles and boundaries have been decided between our two governments, it would be desirable for the United Kingdom Government to approach the Arab states under their protection, and for the L.K. Government and the United States Government to approach the rest jointly, or in concert - i.e. they agree generally with the views expressed in the first three sentences of para 6 of the Foreign Office despatch under reference. They added that, from their point of view, it would be much better to wait until some solution of thePalestine problem appeared to be in sight, but hoped tnat this woulli be the ease by the time our two governments are hre ready to take action. 10. They raised two additional points. The first was that of secrecy, vjg-g-vtg the oil companies. Some interest in off-share concessions had been expressed by some United States oil companies which have, and by some which have not, concessions in the area. The a&amp;te Department felt that all oil companies shoud have an equal opportunity of bidding for concessions in hhe areas with which we are dealing, and hope that you will agree with this. If so, they suggest that, at the moment when our two governments approach the states concerned, a press release should be issued about what is proposed, ee so that everyone would start on an equal footing. If this were delayed beyond that moment, one or other of the governments concerned would certainly tell one or other of the oil companies, and if this were done by the Saudi-Arabian Government for example, the Arabian American oil Company would start whth an advantage. The second point on which they would be grateful for information is whether H.M.G. haver formally adopted, or are likely to adopt, as a result of these discussions, the principal of the Continental Shelf for the division of seabed areas in gnneral.- 3 - ) (7) I 11. We would be grateful for any further observations which you may have An the light of these preliminary State Department views, and we would also be grateful If you could prepare a map showing your own tentative Ideas, as It will obviously be somewhat difficult to make much progress on the geographical division of the seabed in so far as the projection of land frontiers is concern ed, unless we can see how it will look, Whatever principle is ntmi adopted, it will obviously be important that it should look eqAit- able on the map, as well as be equitable in principle. 12. One further point. You will see from paragraphs 3 and 5 of our telegram No.221 Saving of 13th November 1947 that it was n suggested that Service advisers migh t be associated with these talks in view of the possible repercussions (in international law or in practice) of the present proposals on issued other than those with which we are at present concerned. Would you kindly let us have your views on this too ? 13.

CONPIft- vT1 &amp;Q th uctooer, 1948. a Will you please refer to correspondence ending with my P.L. No. B/221 (86/62) - K/10Q (86/62) - M/bO (86/62) of the 8th July, about the contlmentai shelf. 2. Following the development of a technique whereby the oil deposits lying beneath the bed of the sea may be exploited, the Government of the United States in 1946 made a formal proclamation of jurisdiction over the natural resources of the continental shelf of the United States. While our views and those of the United States, have generally been easily reconciled in matters concerning limits of oil concessions on land, according to established international practice, the introduct ion of an entirely new element into the whole conception of territorial and maritime rights, has rendered essential a clearer definition of national jurisdiction with regard to the seabed in those parts of the world in which national interests, particularly those of the United Kingdom and United States, might tend to conflict. Such areas are the West Indies and the Persian Gulf. 3. It has therefore been decided by Governments of United Kingdom and United States that a definition in general terms of the jurisdiction over the continental shelf claimed by the various Persian Gulf states should be made at an early opportun ity in order to place on a regular and agreed basis any future sea-bed drilling which may be undertaken in the near future by Oil Companies operating in the Persian Gulf, and to prevent premature claims to the sea-bed off the shore of the Persian Gulf States by other powers. 4. It has been agreed by ourselves and the United States that in the near future, the Governments of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms and of the Sultanate of Muscat should be given copies of a draft declaration Jtka on the lines of that at Appendix 'A', with the request that they should study them but treat them as strictly confidential for a period of time not exceeding about three weeks in order to allow time for all rulers to be informed of the action which we are proposing to take, and in order to give the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, time to warn the Iraq and Persian Governments of the action which they have taken and the reason for it. After the expiry of this period? the termination of which will be notified to all rulers (during which time, the Iraq and Persian Governments will have been approached), the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms and Muscat will be at liberty to publish the prodlamation if they so desire. 6. The exact form of the declaration is not yet final, but it is expected to be similar to that attached. The final text will be sent to you when received from the Foreign Office, together with final instructions regarding date of / communication i Lt.Colonel A.G. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Kuwait.- 2 - n communication to the Shaikhs or the Sultan* 6* You will note that whilst the ‘‘Median Line 11 may be fairly easily determined, there has been no hard and fast definition of the boundaries between the individual states on the Western and Southern sides of the Persian Gulf; these, like the land frontier, remaining to be determined at a later date in many cases. 7 # in the case of Muscat, the present declaration takes into consideration only that part of Muscat territory which lies in the Persian Gulf, as opposed to the Gulf of uman, and does not prejudice the Sultan's right in the sea-bed of the Gulf of Oman or the Arabian Sea. The United States' State Department may possibly make a separate approach to the Sultan, in addition to that made by the Political Agent, ^ Muscat, by virtue of the long standing treaty relations of Muscat and the United States, or, alternatively may request us to inform the Sultan that our own approach is made in their name also. Instructions on this point are being sought from the Foreign Office. 8.

I realise that further delav may lead to a dif ficult situation with the Saudi Arabian Oovt., the oil companies and some Persian Gulf rulers. If it is neces sary to say anything further to the governments meanwhile it seems that our advice must be that while they can con tinue non-committal discussions with the oil companies it would be most undesirable for any individual govt, either to commit itself to the company or to claim to extend its \ Jurisdiction until the legal basis for such action has been more fully examined. 3* Oil companies could if necessary also be advised to restrict their activities to informal exploratory con tacts which are at present taking place and it could be that it is contrary to their own interests to press the government to make arbitrary proclamations or enter /commitments- 2 - mmm commitnients with regard to definite erees of the see-bed until it is known how eny such cleims or concessions would fit into the genersl picture which will in due course \ emerge. 1.

Preamble, paragraph 2, so far applicable, and paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft proclamation in your letter E14DG9/276/91 to Jeuda would stand. 2. I also suggest that if the Iraqis want to issue a proclamation we should try to get it issued as nearly simjiltaneous as possible with the Kuwait proclamation.

Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. 4th January, 1949. Please refer to paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 361 of the 24th December in which you say that you will welcome a further report from me on the desire of Trans World Air Lines to call at Kuwait on their scheduled service to Bombay. 2. The Shailch has confirmed that he has not committed himself to Trans World Air Lines. When he discussed the matter with me, he stressed the bad air communications with Kuwait, and in particular the lack of any air link with India, and he said he was very anxious that Trans World Air Lines should make Kuwait a port of call to overcome this deficiency. In fact he looked forward to seeing Kuwait an air-port of world importance. 3. At present, so far as I am aware, the only scheduled services which visit Kuwait, are the Iraqi Airways* daily service from Basra, which goes on to Bahrain once a week, and the British Overseas Airways Corporation*s Skymaster service. The latter is intended for oil company personnel, but there is usually accommodation available in it between Kuwait and Bahrain. I note that in Baghdad telegram No. 1197 of December 22nd, the opinion is expressed that foreign commercial operators should not be allowed to use Kuwait either on scheduled or charter flights approaching any degree of frequency, or regularity. I presume this is the opinion of the Civil Air Attache. I regret that I do not find myself in complete agreement with it. Naturally, I would prefer to see all Kuwait traffic reserved for British services, but unless the British Overseas Airways Corporation is in a position to supply Kuwait*s needs in this respect, I think it would be a mistake from every point of view to shut out foreign services. At present there is no air service catering for traffic between the Gulf States and India. It is true that a number of through services proceed direct from the Gulf to India, but there is rarely any accommodation, at any rate in the east-bound planes. Unless therefore, the British Overseas Airways Corporation are willing to cater for traffic between Kuwait and India, which is not likely to be very large, I am doubtful if we should object to Trans World Air Lines making Kuwait a port of call on their scheduled service to Bombay.

My telegram No. 5624. Off shore oil in the Persian Gulf. State Department have now discussed the whole problem with Mr. Wiley and we have had meeting with them and him at which Pyman was also present. 2. Mr. Wiley recognised that the activities of the oil companies made some early action essential but expressed the strong conviction that the political situation in Middle East particularly in Iran be our primary concern. He felt that it was important that the Sa'ed ?idea which was well disposed towards Britain and United States should not be weakened by any action of ours over the next few months (if it can last so long). It was also very important in his opinion that the Soviet Government should be given no shadow of an excuse for presenting to Iran and other countries seemingly plausible arguments to the effect that an initiative had been taken &gt; ' ' by the Western Powers which was designed to benefit their 'imperial interests'. Furthermore, Soviet Government had made it very clear to Iranian Government that it would not tolerate the presence of United States Missions in Iran or the Iranians failure to implement Soviet-Iran oil agreement. Mr. Wiely firmly believed that the Soviet Government have designs upon Iran which it would try to fulfil when the moment was ripe and that in view of the disputes in other parts of the world in which Soviet prestige was involved presure . upon the Iranian Government might be seriously increased by any public move within the Iran Gulf area such as the issue of the proclamations. He felt /He felt therefore that, whilst our objective should be the same and that we should go as far as we could to ensure orderly development In Iran Gulf, any action which we took eu* ought to be subject to over-riding necessity of not precipitating the danger referred to above. S. In concrete terms is as follows. No proclamations should be issued at all. Instead our two governments should go privately to the two States^where action is needed at once - namely Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - and inform these In confidence of the views which have already been agreed to between us and of the areas In which we suggest they might grant concessions. They would be asked to keep our advice to themselves. We pointed out that without the proclamations there would be no (gp./undec) (gp./undec) Jurisdiction by the States concerned over their respective offshore areas and that this r. jght cause difficulties in the future. State Department felt that the \ grant of concessions would be in the establishment of a certain right, and that it could be pointed out to the States concerned that, if they strayed beyond the areas suggested they might find other states counterclaiming against them and would then find it difficult to grant concessions at all. (There is of course the risk that the Saudi Arabian Government might wish to follow the precedents set up elsewhere and insifct on issuing a proclamation in which, despite our warnings they might try for bargaining purposes to claim more than the area to which we think them entitled). 4. At the same time, State Department continued, our both parties should also speak to the oil companies now concerned in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, equally privately and in the same sense, telling them that, if they wished to bid for concessions in the areas concerned our respective governments would have no objection. It would then be left to the companies to enter into negotiations with Saudi Arabia and Kuwai 5. The oil companies minimum requirement would of course be to have some assurance that, if they put large sums of money into a new concession in the hope that they would ultimately receive a return in the oil, there should be no doubt as to the legality and liberty of that concession. State Department considered that, as regards the states other than shaikhdoms (where H.lfi could go further) it would not be possible to say more to the companies than that our respective Governments had no objection to their seeking the concessions inquestion. But State Department felt that the knowledge that the companies had the backing of our respective governments in the matter should give them some degree of confidence. 6. Mr. Villey said that in his experience that oil companies often failed td realize the keenness of competition between them and must sometimes yield to the broader political considerations. They would certainly wi^h to obtain the new concessions in order to forestall ' / 7 rival firms, the terms of which would probably require an early start of operations. It would therefore be very necessary for our two S governments to guide the companies along the right frath so far as immediate necessity for exploitation of new oil supplies in offshore areas shouJsd be made clear to the oil companies that the political be well advised in their own interests to go cautiously. Furthermore, they might be told that if they gave the matter any publicity they could expect no further help from our two governments. \ 7. If this course of action were adopted nothing need be said to the Iranian Government nor need anything be said to Iraq or to the ' other shaikhdoms at the present time or indeed until the initiatives by the oil companies made it necessary to treat them in the same way as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 8. Although these suggestions would mean that we should in a sense • be returning to the idea of dealing with the situation ad hoc they would in the state Departments view have the advantage that the whole question would be treated discreetly and without any publicity that Iran need not be brought into it that the Bahrain difficulty need not £&lt;X-S vC be raised and that accusations by, and increased from, the Soviet Union could be avoided. Yet the necessary advice could be given at once to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait where the immediate need existed and to the oil companies concerned there and it could be given later to the other states and companies as the need might arise. State Department felt that if we maintained our objectives and agreed principles but altered our methods in this way our governments might be able to meet the essential needs of the moment for orderly development in the Persian Gulf without incurring political difficulties of which both yoi &gt; ' / : i possible, bearing in mind the apparent fact that the world economic as opposed to the narrowly commercial point of view there was no situation in the Middle East was extremely delicate and they wouldand they are actually aware. 9. State Department regret as do we to confront you at this late stage with yet another proposal but they would be grateful for your early views on their suggestions. Foreign Office please pass to Bahrain as mytel Wo.15.

It is not yet necessary to commu nicate to them the draft proclamation forwarded with my S.C. letter 40/27/48. An approach has already been made to the Shaikh of Kuwait and I enclose a copy of Foreign Office tele gram No.225 dealing with this subject to indicate the lines on which you should proceed. I consider that action should be taken at once vis-A-vis the Shaikh of Bahrain and as soon as possible vis-A-vis the Shaikhs of &lt;*atar and Abu Dhabi. The other Trucial Coast Shaikhs can be dealt with at greater leisure but it is important that the situation should be ex plained to them before they are approached by any oil company representative• 3.

I understand that State Department have informed the Superior Cil Company that they have no objection to the latter entering into negotiations about the sea bed oil with the Persian Gulf States. It seems likely that the State Department must have given this permission with the proviso that this was as far as they were concerned, since they were not in a position to authorise American Cil Companies to negotiate with rulers under our protection and open to our advice in this matter. However as the Superior and other American companies presumably now consider themselves authorised to pursue enquiries regarding concessions for the sea bed, I consider we would no longer be justified in prohibiting British companies from at least tdking with the Shaikhs about possible terms particularly Shaikhs in the areas where pressure exists i.e. Kuwait and Qatar. 3. You should therefore inform the Shaikhs accordingly making it clear that they should not commit themselves and that our advice about the timing of the proclamations will follow. Proclamations by the States other than Kuwait and Bahrain who may require to make proclamations early, may be spaced over a period, being made as and when seems necessary in consultation with us. You should in any case avoid giving the impression that the proposals referred to in the first paragraph above have been finalised.Telegram ?

Addressed to Washington telegram No* 11823 of November 2nd* Repeated for information to Jeduah, Bahrain, Baghdad, Tehran. Jeddah telegram No* 356* In circumstances as now reported by Jeauah, it seems clear that unless we are definitely to favour the interests of an American company at the expense of a British, we can no longer restrain Weightman from approaching the bhaikh of Kuwait. Subject, therefore, to the views of the Political Resident, we do not feel that we can refuse Weightman facilities to visit Kuwait though we do not propose that he should be given any special assistance and after he has arrived in Kuwait he will have to make his own approach presumably through the Shaikh*s Secretary* Before he goes, we would also propose that the Political Agent should tell the Shaikh that since we know the oil companies are most interested in gaining the concessions to exploit the oil believed to exist beneath the sea bed, we have been giving consideration to the means whereby the Rulers of the Gulf States could extehd their jurisdiction over the sea bed in order to open the way for development of any oil and hope very shortly to be able to inform him of our views. In tjie meantime, should he be approached by any oil company we hope that he will ensure that all conversations which may ensue will be entirely secret and noncommittal since premature disclosure may adversely affect his interests* We should be glad if you would explain the position as stated above and in Jeddah telegram No. 356 to the State Department.COPY J TELE ’'NS' Cypher.

These points were discussed with the State Department who have now informed us that they have secured approval for action referred to in para 2 of rry tel 768 and have sent sets of prin ciples to U.S. Ambassador Jedda for communication to the Saudi Arabian Government. The text of these principles is contained in my immediately following telegram which at the request of the State Department is not being repeated to Jedda since U.S. Ambassador there might not yet have received his own airmail copy and is in any case instructed to show it to H.V. Ambassaddr upon receipt. No text of a draft proclamation exists. It will probably be worked out on the spot by officials of the Arabian American Oil Company and it will in effect only clothe in legal language what is contained in the set of principles. The way is therefore now clear for H.M.G. to offer similar advice to the Saudi Arabian Government (or if you so wish to say nothing at all to them unless they should ask whether H.^.G. agree to the advice given by the United States Government). State Department fully understand tint you will probably to take some action quickly with Bahrain and Kuwait emu possible also with Qatar. They would prefer that this should be initiated after the Saudi Arabian &amp; proclamation has been issued and are anxious that no reference should in any case be made to the part played in the latter by the Uni ted States Government. The reason for this is that in order to make the origin of the whole affair (????????? 'as secret’', 'os private' ?? omitted) as possible, State Department wish the U.S. Government to be kept out of the matter so far as the2 &amp; outside world is concerned and to let It appear that S. Arabia is taking action on his own iniative. We asked the State Department to let us know as soon as they had any indication that a Saudi Arabian proclamation was imminent, they have as yet heard nothing about this but expect one may be issued quite soon. 5 State Department did question us about the line which you were f akir.g with British Oil Companies (your tel 2312 not repeated elsewhere) we therefore gave them the gist of the last sentence of Paragraph 2 and of paragraph 3 of your tel no 82 to Bahrain. They had no objection to this, having indeed themselves told such US oil companies as had enquired that they were free to enter into discussions concerning Off Shore concessions in the Persian Gulf, but should do so without pub licity. One po'nt to which the State Department attach great importance is that no opportunity should be given for criticism that certain oil companies had been favoured as against other oil companies. They are most anxious that the kin ' 5 of contro versy which arose after the first world war should be avoided.

It is desirable to give encouragement to any efforts which will bring about a greater utili/zation of the worlds natural resources. 2. Valuable resources may underlie parts of the Persian Gulf off the coasts of Saudi Arabia and it is becoming increasingly practicable tc utilize such submerged resources. 3 . It is necessary for the littoral state to exercise juris diction over these resources in order tc conserve and control utilization of such resources. 4 . The practice of other nations in contemplating the juris diction over the sub soil and sea bed areas contigueus to their coasts may take as precedent Saudi Arabia in abusing (assuming . ) that sub soil and sea bed of these areas of the Persian Gulf contiguous to (1 gp/undec ? its) Coasts appertaining to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and are subject to its jurisdiction and control. 5 . Whenever it might become necessary to define more precise ly the boundaries of such submerged areas they should be deter mined in accordance with equitable principles by Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in agreements with other states having jurisdic tion and control over adjoining submerged areas. 6 . The assertion of jurisdiction over submerged areas beyond the coastal area should not affect the free use of waters of- 2 - such areas, or air above such waters, or fishing and frac tional pearling rights in the Persian Gulf.

PD/8 Dear Nuttall, British Middle East Office, 10, sharia Tolumbat, CAIRO. ^ 4,&gt; ii *1 I have just received your letter of March 24th, putting me wise to the latest development in connection with Off-shore oil in the Persian Gulf, namely the opinion obtained by K.O.C* from Professor Lauterpacht. I must say that to my way of thinking his argument is quite persuasive, and I.P.C^ rapid reaction neither more nor less than what was to be expected. This certainly has been a tangled skein. I had just been / --4oing my best to unravel it, going back through the wad of telegrams that have accumulated on my file over the past six months. The one thread that seems to have run consistently through it is H.M.C^s preoccupation with the risk of adverse reaction on the paft of Persia, much less concern over this having seemingly been felt in Washington, notwithstanding the very strong views expressed by their Ambassador at Tehran. are No doubt because their responsibilities in the Persian Gulf , compared with H.M.C.'s negligible, the Americans seem to have taken a rather casual view of the whole affair, as instanced in the first place by their notion of dropping the whole idea of proclamations and leaving the actual granting of concessions to establish a sort of de facto jurisdiction; and in the second place by their leaving to a private interest (i*e. to ARAMCG whose reputation for responsibility is not I think particularly high) the delicate and all important task of formulating a proclamation for Saudi Arabia which may well become a test case. Washington's main concern is evidently to avoid publicity and (as if that were remotely possible) to have the v/hcle thing appear to neighbouring States and the outside world as a natural out-growth of the inter-play of private interests with the Saudi Arabian Government and one or two of its lesser neighbours. The plan now settled upon between Whitehall and Washington (if I understand it aright) whilst something of a compromise, appears none the less to provide as far as is humanly possible the safeguards which H.M.G. have been consistently seeking. Events now wait upon the Saudi proclamation. But what is going to happen if the Saudis, for one reason or another, procrastinate indefinitely? It would on the face of it, be consistent with H.M.G.'s josition that the Sheikh of Kuwait, and other protected Rulers immediately concerned, should nevertheless issue their proclamations. I am sending copies of this slight exercise to Tehran, Bagdad and Bahrein - for what it may be worth. To the first two I am also sending copies of your letter since you do not mention that Foreign Office have acquainted them, besides Bahrain, with Professor Lauterpacht's interesting opinion on the scope of landward concessions.

PRIORITY . CUNFIDLBTI,^ Your telegram No. 201. You may now inform Sheikhs that they will be free to grant conditional concessions or give letters of intention as from June 4th making clear the following points: 1) The ruler should not grant a conditional concession except in respect of an area which he is satisfied does not fall within an existing concession. 2) The conditional concession should be subject to any ri 0 hts which may be established under existing concessions in accordance with (mut) provided in those concessions i.e. accord ing to x arbitration failing settlement between ruler and concessionnaire company. 3) The concession should not contain provisions which may afford holders an opport unity of acting in a manner detrimental to the existing interests of companies holding con cessions for adjacent lands. 4) The general principles ? embodied in the draft proclamation already forwarded to you should not*be violated. 2 . There are similar instructions Cmutl arising out of the draft conditional concession prepared by 3HE. ;L which are of general interest andregarding which we should perhaps make the points clear both to the Sheikhs and Companies in general terms and without mentioningmentioning SHELL. SHELL have made following proposals amongst others : C/sJ / ^tr J ^ ' a) the final boundaries/of concession, area to be such as shall be &lt;mut) by you as having been established by agreement, between ruler and Government adjacent to territories or otherwise. b) the Company to pay the ruler within 28 days of certification proposed under (a) above an amount calculated on the basis of so many pounds Sterling per square mile of concession area. c) if any claimant establishes prior rights or proclamation is revoked in respect of v/hple concession area concession shall terminate without oo ling into effect and ruler shall pay back sums paid to him together with such ? other compensation as you may determine as being reasonable having regard to loss suffered by company. M d) if no proclamafi on has been issued, within stated number of months from date of concession sum of money paid to ruler in sign ing of concession shall oe repaid. 3. I shall be grateful for your immediate comments. ily provisional views on above points are as follows; a) in view of b) in para 2 ? ILIG might not wish to assume responsibility of certification which ' might be delayed indefinitely through prolonged disputes between neighbouring rulers. b) though payment on an a-~ea basis will make rulers (nut) over their claims and weaken our ability to negotiate for them, financial interest of companies in such a clause is understandable. After warning companies of difficulty which such a clause might place in way of settle;lent of boundaries and making it clear to them that they include it on their own responsibility we could hardly carry on our objections further. c) we night not wish to be drawn in to arbitrate over loss suffered by companies.d) this need not present any difficulty if there ? is no undue delay in oheikhs making proclamation. If all ^oes well it seems likely that a six months period mi Jit be agreed to. 4. The Ministry of Fuel and Power will now inform British Companies of decision in para 1 and of points referred to in (a) to (c) of paragraph 2 and my provisional views thereon. His Majesty’s ambassador at Mashingtom will be separately asked to inform the State Department in the same sense at the same time no sooner (mnt) are informed.

Yours ever, CHAHCI&amp;Y. British Consulate-General, BAHKACOPY (S 12676/700/91) The 1923 and 1932 definitions do not define the course of the frontier along the Khor Ah dull ah. The 1940 Note from His Majesty’s Ambassador to the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs, suggesting demarcation and defining more exactly the 1923 and 1932 definition, contains this description:- '(6) From the point defined in sub-paragraph (4) the Junction of the thalwegs of Khors Zubeir and „ Abdullah to the open sea the boundary shall follow the thalweg of the Khor Abdullah” The suggestion to divide the Khor Abdullah in this way seems a little hard on Iraq in view of the previous sub-paragraph (5) of the 1940 Note, which ensures that if the boundary strikes the Khor zubeir at a point above its Junction with the Khor Abdullah, it shall follow the low-water line on the ri^ht bank to a point opposite the Junction, ' thus leaving the whole of the Khor zubeir to Iraq' , This clause was presumabiy inserted to ensure that the Iraqis possessed a navigable channel ip to their port at Umm Qasr, which is partially taken away from them if they have to share the Khor Abdullah with Kuweit. In this connexion, His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad, reporting on the Iraqi rejection of the request for demarcation stated that it had been made known to him that 'the Ministry of Defence, when asked for their views on His Majesty’s Government’s proposals, had deprecated the demarcation of the frontier until what th^r called ’the question of the cession to Iraq of the Islands of Warhah and Bubain’ had been settled. 'Your Lordship will r^-all that the Iraqis at one time had the idea that these two islands might be given to them for nothing in order that they should have complete control over the approaches to the projected port at Umm Qasr.' un In view of this it seems/likely that Iraq will consent to a definition of the frontier running along the Thalweg of the Khor Abdullah (or Shetana) even if she accepts the remainder of the 1940 definition* (signed) F.C.

His Majesty’s Government presume that the Iraqi Government also will be interested in the resources of the sub-soil and sea-bed lying off the coast of Iraq, and that they may wish to issue a proclamation on similar lines* 5 * The Iraqi Government will observe that the proclamations to be issued by the Rulers of the Persian Gulf States under His Majesty’s Government’s protection will not mention any fixed boundaries to the areas within which jurisdiction is asserted over the sub-soil and sea bed, and will not therefore prejudice the interests of other Governments in adjacent areas.i whereas it is dasiz^able to give encoura^ojaent to any efforts which will bring ab nit greater utilization of the world* s natural resources: Whereas waluable resources may underlie parts of the Persirn Quit off the coasts cf and it is becoming increasingly practicable to utilize such a dbu erg ej re s&lt; o. zees; V^iereas it is desirable in the interests of protection conservation and orderly development that the exploitation of such resources should be properly controlled: whereas it is just that the sea-bed and sub soil extending to a reasonable distance from the coast should appertain to and be controlled by the littoral state to which it is adjacent: Whereas the right of a littoral state to exercise its control over the natural resources of the sea bed and sub-soil adjacent to its coasts has been established in international practice by the action of other States: Now therefore we the of in pursuance of all the powers enabling us in that behalf are pleased to proclaim and it is hereby proclaimed as follows: The of hereby declares that the sea-bed and sub-soil lying beneath the high seas of the Persian £3ulf contiguous to the territorial waters of and extending sea ward to boundaries to be determined more precisely as occasion arises on equitable principles by the of after consulting the neighbouring states appertain to the of » /and • • •and arc subject to its exclusive jurisdiction and control* Hothing in this p roc law at ion shall be dceaed to ai'fect sovereignty over the isltJids or the status of the scabbed and sub-soil beneath any territorial waters* nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to affect the character as high se&amp;a of the waters of the Persian Guxx above the saa-bed and outside the limits of territorial waters or the status of the air space above the water# cf the Persian Gulf outside territorial nmters or fishing and traditional pearling rights in such waters*(5/195/49) 12th July, 1949.

The correspondence mentions consultations with the United State's State Department, and the reasons for making joint Anglo-American plans to coordinate the extension of the territorial waters of various Arab Gulf states. Many of the letters discuss this as both a response to Iranian ambitions in the Gulf, and as a cautionary measure so as to avoid conflict between American and British oil interests in the region. Of note are several discussions on the choice of terminology to describe the marine territory in question, such as sovereignty versus jurisdiction.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Sea bed mining</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000116#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
