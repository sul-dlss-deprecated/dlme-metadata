With a view to facilitate commerce and for the purpose of regulating and securing the revenue which His Highness the Sultan now derives from the customs and other duties levied on foreienl merchandize and on inland produce, the following Regulations contained in Articles VII VTIT I X X, XI, and XII have been agreed upon. ' ' | ARTICLE VII. His Highness the Sultan shall be permitted to levy a duty of entry not exceeding 5 per cent, on the value of all goods and merchandize, of whatever description, imported by sea from foreiiri countries, and landed at any port in the islands or on the coast of the mainland of Africa within the dominions of His Highness. This duty shall be paid at that port in His Highness' dominion!, where the goods are first landed, and on payment thereof such goods shall thereafter be exempt; within the Zanzibar dominions, from all other customs duties or taxes levied by or on behalf of tin' Government of His Highness the Sultan, by whatever names these may be designated, and no higher import duty shall be claimed from British subjects than that which is paid by subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation. This duty once paid shall cover, from all other charges on the part of His Highness the Sultan goods of whatever description coming from foreign countries by sea, whether these are intendui for local consumption or for transmission elsewhere, in bulk or otherwise, and whether they remain in the state in which they are imported or have been manufactured. Spirits and spirituous liquors of all kinds imported into the dominions of His Highness the Sultan from abroad shall bo subject to an entry or import duty of 25 per cent, ad valomm, 'jJeer and wines containing less than 20 per cent, by volume of alcohol are not to be considered or classed as spirituous liquors within the meaning of this Article. These latter, therefore, remain subject to the common entry duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem. There shall, however, be exempted from payment of all duty the following, namely : 1. All goods and merchandize which, being destined for a foreign port, are transshipped from one vessel to another in any of the ports of His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, or which have been for this purpose provisionally landed and deposited in any of the Zanzibar custom -houses to await the arrival of a vessel in which to be reshipped abroad. But goods and merchandize so landed shall be exempted only provided that the consignee or his agent shall have, on the arrival of the ship, handed over the said goods to be kept under Customs seal, and declared them as landed for trans shipment, designating at the same time the foreign port of destination, and also provided that the said goods are actually shipped for the same foreign port as originally declared, within a period not exceeding six months after their first landing, and without having in the interval changed owners. 2. All goods and merchandize which, not being consigned to a port within the dominions of tlie Sultan, have been inadvertently landed, provided that such goods and merchandize are reshipped on board of the ssime vessel and therein are transported abroad. Should, however, such goodsl or merchandize here spoken of be opened or removed from the custody of the Customs authorities the full duty shall then be payable on the same. 3. Coals, naval provisions stores and fittings, the property of Her Majesty's Government, landed in the dominions of His Highness for the use of the ships of Her Majesty's navy. 4. All goods and merchandize transshipped or landed for the repair of damage caused by stress of weather or other disasters at sea, provided the cargo so discharged shall be reshipped and taken away on board of the same sessel, or if the latter shall have been condemned, or her departure delayed in any other. 5. Machines and implements for agricultural purposes, also all materials destined for the con struction and maintenance of roads, tramways, or railroads, and generally all means of conveyance, certified by the attestation of a British Consular officer resident in Zanzibar dominions to bo destined for emmtries inland and west of His Highness' dominions.ARTICLE VIII. His Highness the Sultan is further permitted to levy a special export duty, but only on the articles and to the amount hereafter stated, 'on such merchandize and native products coming from his own dominions, or from the interior of Africa, as are included in the annexed Tariff. This special duty to be levied by and on behalf of His Highness the Sultan shall be paid (if such has not been previously done) at all events previous to the shipment of these articles out of the dominions of His Highness the Sultan. No distinction shall be made whether the said goods and native produce have their origin within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, or come from districts of the African Continent beyond His Highness , frontiers. But if the special duty on goods and produce above referred to has once been paid, the latter, whether in a raw or manufactured state, shall not be again taxed with other duties or imposts, levied by or on behalf of the Government of His Highness the Sultan, but may thereafter be relauded free at any port in the dominions of His Highness, and be exported without further charge, always provided that they have not previously been landed and manufactured in a foreign country. The High Contracting Parties reserve to themselves the right to claim a revision of the annexed special Tariff, after successive terms of five years, to begin to reckon from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of the Treaty, in order to allow of such alteration, additions, or amendments being made as experience may have shown to be necessary or desirable. ARTICLE IX. lb is fully understood by the High Contracting Parties that the special duties referred to in Article VIII to be levied on behalf of His Highness the Sultan shall be in lieu of and as equivalent for :— 1. The monopoly rights, which until now His Highness has been authorized by former Treaties to exercise over ivory and copal coming from certain districts on the coast. The taxes until now charged on these articles as monopoly taxes shall therefore cease and be abolished. 2. The duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem, or in kind, now levied on goods, and produce of the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, and of the interior of Africa, at the first port of His High- ness' dominions where such goods happen to be landed, and also the additional taxes which His Highness has for some time levied on certain goods or produce under the denomination of native taxes are abolished and shall cease. It is understood that such other goods, merchandize, and produce brought by land from those districts of the African Continent to the west of the dominions of His Highness as are not included in the special Tariff now agreed upon, are not liable for duty of any description; they shall, on entering, leaving, and while within the dominions of His Highness, bo free from all duties, taxes, and customs of His Highness' Government. It is also agreed between the High Contracting Parties that British subjects arc not liable to be taxed by or on behalf of His Highness the Sultan, or his authorities, with any other duties, customs, or taxes than those before specified in Articles VII and VIII, whether for their persons, houses, lands, or goods. ARTICLE X. It is, however, agreed and understood by the High Contracting Parties that, in the event of an arrangement being entered into hereafter between His Highness and the Powers having Treaty relations with Zanzibar, and to which Great Britain shall be a consenting party, whereby vessels entering the port of Zanzibar shall be charged with shipping, tonnage, or harbour dues, such dues to be administered under the control of a special Board for the improvement of the harbour and construction and maintenance of lighthouses, &amp;c., nothing in the aforementioned provisions shall bo construed so as to exempt British vessels from payment of such shipping, harbour, or tonnage dues as may hereafter be agreed upon. ARTICLE XI. It shall be at the option of the British subject in each case to pay the percentage duties stipula ted in Articles VII and VIII either in cash, or, if the nature of the goods allow of it, in kind, by giving up an equivalent amount of the goods or produce. In the event of payment being made in cash, the value of the merchandize, goods, or produce on which duty is to be levied shall be fixed according to the ready-money market price ruling at the time when the duty is levied. In the case of foreign imports the value shall be fixed according to the market price at Zanzibar, and in that of native goods and produce by the market price at the place where the merchant shall choose to pay the duty. In the event of any dispute arising between a British subject and the Custom-house authorities regarding the value of such goods, this shall be determined by reference to two experts,, each3o party nominatmg one, and the value so ascertained shall be decisive. Should, however, these P not be able to a 8 rG6 J they shall choose an umpire, whose decision is to be considered final. ARTICLE XII. ir H ]!t n | lm ? S % t i h0 , n ,ltai1 of Zanzibar engages by the present Treaty to provide, and give orders o his ofhciaLs, that the movement of goods m transit shall not be obstructed or delayed in J vexations manner by unnecessary Customs formalities and regulations, and that every faeilitl . be ^ for transport by land and river, and that as far as is con«isSUth ^ carried P^ 810118 ot thls rreat ^ the Principles approved of by the Congo Conference shall be commer^ i h^ I ^iS rt]l i e 7 }m f oHllke * to 4 8GG that a custom-house answering all requirements o&gt; ^ommerce be erected at Zanzibar, with stores secure against fire, decay, or theft for the nrotor ion ot the goods placed therein.

(feigned) Signature in Arabic.1 No. 1076-B, Feom The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT or INDIA, To SlE, The POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Simla, the 28th May 1S88. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 283, dated the 6th of NoyemLer 1887, forwarding a draft of the revised treaty, which you recommeiid should he negotiated with His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. 2. In reply I am to state that the terms of your draft, which you ohser\e has been drawn up on the lines of the existing treaty with the Sultan of Zanzibar, seem to the Government of India to be generally suitable to the circumstances of Muscat. A few slight alterations have been made in Articles II and VI, and a new Article No. XX has been inserted in the terms of Article XXIV of the Zanzibar treaty. These changes will be readily seen on a com parison of the revised draft herewith returned with the one previously submitted by you, and they do not require explanation. 3. There are, however, two further points in which the proposed treaty still appears to be deficient; but, without better information of the circum stances of trade in Muscat territories, the Government of India are unable to do more than indicate the action necessary to meet these deficiencies. 4. In the first place, the import duty which the Saltan is to be allowed to charge under Article VI is not only an import duty, but operates as a transit duty on goods which are re-exported by land. It is not known whether transac tions of sufficient consequence are carried on in this way to necessitate a provision in the treaty for the exemption of such re-exports by land. Should such a necessity be found to exist, I am to request that a provision to meet it may be inserted in the revised draft. 5. Secondly, the treaty, as at present drafted, contains no provisions about export duties. XTnless these are specially provided for, the Sultan has it in his power, at any moment, to raise duties to a prohibitive point, or to stop trade summarily by an order prohibiting the export of any article or articles. The treaty should, therefore, contain a clause which will give the Sultan the right to impose an export duty not exceeding the sum now charged on any article now liable to duty, and depriving him of the power to add to the list or to increase the rate.2 6. In the final paragraph of your letter under reply; you remark tliat His Highness the Sultan has not yet been consulted regarding the treaty. His sanction should now be obtained to the revised draft, with the additions indicated in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this letter ; and the treaty, as then revised, should be returned to this office. It will be understood that you are not at present authorised to execute the Treaty, but merely to ascertain that the Sultan is prepared to accept it. I have the honour to be. Sir, Tour most obedient Servant, Secretary to the Government of India.P :■ ^ DR4ET. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Naviga tion between Her Majesty and His High ness the Sultan of Muscat. Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India, and His Highness the Seyyid Turki bin Saeed bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, being desirous to confirm and strengthen the friendly relations which now subsist between the two countries, and to pro mote and extend their commercial rela tions, have named as their plenipoten tiaries to conclude a treaty for this pur pose, that is to say : — Article 1.

Subjects of Her Britannic Majesty shall for the purposes of this trea- ty, in clude subjects of Native States in ~IndTaj^ Such subjects shall enjoy, im- oi mediately and unconditionally, through- s out the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat with respect to com merce, shipping, and the exercise of trade, as in every other respect, all the rights, privileges, immunities, advan tages, and protection of whatsover nature, which are, or hereafter may be, enjoyed by, or accorded to, the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation. They shall more specially not be liable to other or more onerous duties, imposts, restrictions or obligations, of whatever description, than those to which sub jects or citizens of the most favoured nation now are, or hereafter may be, subjected. Article III. The two high contracting parties ack nowledge reciprocally to each other the right of appointing Consuls to reside in each other's dominions wherever the interests of commerce may require the presence of such officers, and such Con suls shall at all times be placed in the country in which they reside on the footing of the Consuls of the most favoured nations. Each of the high( 2 ) contracting parties further agrees toper- -ZVo^e.—Article 3 of the existing treaty is retained mit bis own subjects to be appointed to tmi u ' retl E c K consular offices by the other contract ing party, provided always that the persons so appointed shall not begin to act without the previous approbation of the sovereign whose subjects they may be. The public functionaries of either Government, residing in the dominions of the other, shall enjoy the same pri vileges, immunities, and exemptions which are enjoyed within the same dominions by similar public function- aries of other countries. Article IV. There shall be perfect freedom of commerce and navigation between the high contracting parties; each shall allow the subjects of the other to enter all ports, creeks, and rivers, with their vessels and cargoes, also to travel, re side, pursue commerce and trade, whe ther wholesale or retail, in each other's dominions, and therein to hire, pur chase, and possess houses, warehouses, shops, stores, and lands. British sub jects shall everywhere be freely permit ted, whether personally or by agent, to bargain for, buy, barter, and sell all kinds of goods, articles of import or native production, whether intended for sale within the dominions of His High ness or for export, and to arrange with the owner or his agent regarding the price of^ all such goods and produce without interference of any sort on the pait of the authorities of EQs Highness. .

Article VI. His Highness the Sultan shall be permitted to levy a duty of entry not( 3 ) exceeding 5 per cent., on the value of all goods and merchandize of whatever description, imported by sea from foreign countries into His Highnesses dominions. This duty shall be paid at that port in His Higlmess's dominions where the goods are first landed, and on payment thereof such goods shall thereafter be exempt, within the -Sul tan's dominions, from all other customs duties or taxes levied by or on behalf of the Government of His Highness the Sultan, by whatever names these may be designated, and no higher im port duty shall be claimed from British subjects than that which is paid by subjects or citizens of the most favored nation. This duty once paid shall cover, from all other charges on the part of His Highness the Sultan, goods of whatever description coming from foreign coun tries by sea, whether these are intended for local consumption or for transmis sion elsewhere, in bulk or otherwise, and whether they remain in the state in which they are imported or have been manufactured. There shall, however, be exempted from payment of all duty the following, namely :— 1. All goods and merchandize which, being destined for a foreign port, are transhipped from one vessel to another in any of the ports of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, or which have been for this purpose provisionally landed and deposited in any of the Sultan's Custom-Houses to await the arrival of a vessel in which to be re- shipped abroad. But goods and merchan dize so landed shall be exempted only provided that the consignee or his agent shall have, on the arrival of the ship, handed over the said goods to be kept under customs seal, and declared them as landed for transhipment, designating at the same time the foreign port of designation, and also provided that the said goods are actually shipped for the same foreign port as originally declared, within a period not exceeding six months after their first landing, and without having in the interval changed owners, 2. All goods and merchandize which, not being consigned to a port within the dominions of the Sultan, hav^ been in advertently landed, provided that such goods are reshipped within a month of being so landed and are transported abroad.

Ross, C.S .I., Political Resident in the Persian GulE and Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Pars, • To The Secretary to the Government o£ India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1076-E., dated 28th May 1888, on the subject of a proposed Revised Commercial Treaty with the Muscat State. 2. The death of His Highness Seyyid Turki will probably render some post ponement of any steps in this direction necessary, but I now submit replies to the enquiries made in your letter above quoted. 3. As regards the point referred to in paragraph 4 of your letter, after consultation with Colonel Mockler I am of opinion that there is no necessity for any provision for exemption from duty of goods re-exported by land. 4. As regards your paragraph 5, I concur that a special article dealing with the question of export duty generally would be advisable, and I submit a draft article to be numbered VII, which it seems to me would meet existing and future requirements. Such concessions as have been made might best, I think, be continued by special subsidiary notifications, reserving the right of withdrawing such concessions if found necessary or advisable to do so under the favoured nation clause. 5. Colonel Mockler suggests that it might be desirable to give the Sultan of Muscat power to restrict importation of arms and ammunition into his terri tories, and also considers it probable that a clause similar to that in the Zanzibar Treaty providing for enhanced taxation of alcohol would be asked for by the Sultan. 6. As regards the arms, &amp;c., I think the matter might be left to be dealt with should occasion arise, but as to the alcohol question I would favour the suggestion to concede that point, subject always to the stipulation of the favoured nation clause. Draft Article VII. No article whatever shall be prohibited from being imported into or ex ported from the territories of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, and no export duties are to be levied on goods exported from those territories except with the consent of the Government of Her Britannic Majesty, such consent being subject to the conditions that may be laid down in the notifications intimating the same. No. 1654-E., dated Simla, the 15th Augiist 1888. From— Lieutenant W. H. Cornish , Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to reply to your letter No. 218 of the 12th July 1888, regard ing a Revised Commercial Treaty with the State of Muscat. 2. It is not probable that negotiations can be usefully entered into under the present condition of affairs in Muscat, but in order to enable you to act when a suitable opportunity occurs, I am to convey the following remarks : — 3. (a) Your draft Article VII dealing with the question of exports duty is approved. (&amp;) There will be no objection to the insertion of a clause similar to that in the Zanzibar Treaty providing for enhanced taxation of alcohol if the Sultan should desire it. (e) The Government of India agree with you that the question of imposing restrictions on the importation of arms and ammunition into Muscat territory may be left to be dealt with as occasion arises.

I am to inform you that the treaty has been forwarded to Her Ma jesty's Government for orders; but I am to point out that the usual formalities have not been observed in its execution. No authority had been conferred upon you as a Plenipotentiary of Her Majesty for the purpose of negotiating the treaty. The latest instructions issued to you by the Government of India were those contained in this office letter No. 1654 E., dated the 15th August 1888, which expressed concurrence in certain terms of the proposed treaty to enable you to ascertain whether the Sultan was prepared to accept the amended draft. 3. It is usual to engross treaties upon parchment, and it would have been convenient if you had submitted the accepted draft to the Government of India for the purpose of having the copies engrossed. An opportunity would then have been afforded to the Governor-General in Council to obtain for vou the » * necessary authority to conclude the negotiation. 4. I am also to observe that, in the last article of the signed copies of the treaty, there is an erasure which has not been initialled by the Sultan and yourself. I am to say that any alteration in an engrossment of a treaty should be initialled by the contracting parties before signature. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, X Off(j.

As regards the period of duration of the fresh treaty and the cancel lation of the Treaty of 1839, I am to request that the following articles may be embodied in the fresh treaty :— Article I. The Treaty concluded between the British Government and Sultan Seyyid Saeed bin Sultan of Maskat and Oman on the 31st of May 1839, is hereby cancelled and declared void, and the present Treaty when ratified shall be substituted for it. Article XXIII. After the lapse of twelve years from the date on which this Treaty shall come into force and on twelve months' notice given by either party, this Treaty shall be subject to revision by plenipotentiaries appointed on both sides for this purpose, who shall be empowered to decide on and adopt such amendments as experience shall prove to be desirable. 4.

In these circumstances, I concur with Lord Salisbury's view r that the treaty should not be ratified in its present form, and I request ac cordingly that your Excellency will give instruc tions for the conclusion by the Resident in the Persian Gulf of a fresh treaty containing the amendments suggested in the Foreign Office Letter of the 11th December. 4, With regard to the declaration which it was stated in my Despatch of the 7th November might be obtained from the Sultan of Muscat, to the intent that neither His Highness nor his heirs should cede any portion of his dominions to any other power, I am of opinion that an undertaking to this effect should not form part of the Com mercial Treaty, but should be agreed to in a separate form. I therefore request that instruc tions may be given to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the occasion of concluding the proposed fresh Commercial Treaty, to obtain from His Highness the required declaration similar to that contained in the Socotra Treaty of 1876. 30474. 1.2690.

I am directed by Viscount Cross to forward herewith, copy of a * No. loo, Exteruul. letter* from the Government of India, dated . 8th September 1890, with enclosures, from which it will be observed that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently executed a Commercial Treaty with the Sultan of Muscat. The Marquis of Salisbury will see that, by executing this treaty on behalf ot Her Majesty, Colonei Hoss exceeded his instructions, but that the Government of India consider that the absence of authority on the part of the Political Resident does not necessarily vitiate the execution of the treaty, which they accordingly recommend may be accepted and ratified. ^ Lord Cross will be glad to be favoured with the views of the Marquis of Salisbury in respect to the terms of the proposed treaty, and upon the question whether its execution should be considered to have been invalidated by the absence of sufficient authority on the part of the Political Resident. If it is not invalidated, His Lordship, as at present advised, is inclined to support the recommendation of the Government of India that it should be accepted and ratified in its present form. The return of the original treaty is requested. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) H. Walpole. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. Confidential. Foreign Office. Sir, 11th December 1890, With reference to your letters of the 9th and 30th October last, I am now directed by the Marquis of Salisbury to request you to lay before Viscount Cross the following observations respecting the Commercial Treaty between Great Britain and Muscat, which was signed on the 18th of April last. The following clerical errors are in the first place to be noted:— Article 4, third line,/or ' vessel' read 'vessels/' At the end of Article 6 insert the word ' manner.' In Articles 15 and 17, for ' British,' in the last line of each Article, read ' English.' In Article 21 the first Colony mentioned is the ' Dominion,' not 'Dominions' of Canada, and for 'the Cape 1 ' should be sub stituted ' the Cape of Good Hope.' 20474. A 2It appears th at the last paragraph of Article 12 might give rise to great difficulties as to fugitive slaves, and that it is probably iu excess ot the legal powers of this country, which extend only to the surrender of deserters from merchant vessels. The first two paragraphs of this woula however, be useful if the Sultan would agree to retain them without the last paragraph. I am therefore to suggest that an endeavour should be made to retain the first two paragraphs only of this Article, but that, if the Sultan will not consent to this, the whole of Article 12 should be taken out of the treaty» It is presumed that the treaty now under consideration is intended, when in operation, to replace the Convention of 31st May 1839, and Article ^ tliat tilis sIlould be distinctly stated in a separate' It is observed that the treaty contains no clause providing for its penod of auration. It is undesirable that commercial treaties of an indefinite duration should be concluded by this country, and it is there- lore suggested that an Article should be inserted to the effect that the treaty is to remain m force for twelve years from the date of the exchange of ratifications, and to be thereafter terminable at twelve months notice. Viscount Cross will perceive that, if the above suggestions are to be carried out it is at present impossible that Her Majesty's ratification of the treaty should be prepared; and Lord Salisbury inclines to the opinion that it will be best to instruct Colonel Eoss to conclude a fresh treaty containing the necessary amendments. In such a case it would be matter for consideration whether it would be best to propose that the declaration similar to that contained in the Socotra Treaty of 1876, respecting cession, &amp;c., should be inserted in the treaty itself, or should be made by means of a separate dclaration, the latter course being perhaps preferable if a time limit of twelve years is adopted for the Commercial Treaty, as a separate declaration could m that case take a permanent shape.

Lord Salisbury remarked that a precedent for such an undertaking is to be found in the case of * Vide Treaty of 23rd January 1876. Socotra,* and that he does not consider that such a course would be open to protest on the part of France, as being a violation of the Declaration of 1862. 3. Viewing this proposal as a step in the direction of the establishment of a British Pro tectorate over Muscat, I have informed Lord Salisbury that I concur in it, and I have to request that, when the ratification of the new Commercial Treaty entered into with the Sultan of Muscat is announced to your Government, the necessary measures may be taken for obtaining from the Euler of Muscat a declaration in the sense desired.

I should have addressed you before,but 4 that owing to frequent absences of late I have had no opportun ities of sounding local merchants or the Sultan. (g) The Treaty is generally complete and meets requirments but I attach a statement setting forth such minor a terations as occur to or have been suggested to me, together with the considerations which have prompted them. (5) Apart flrom these suggestions there are one or two matters which it seems worth while bringing to notice at this Juncture, and with regard to which yourself and Government will be better Judges as to whether it is expedient for them to be dealt with by treaty and if so in what terms. (I) The Sultan has a number of British subjects in his employ now-a-days e.g.in connection with the Customs administration. Tf4° f ~ I// tn it vk 11 ¥ ' n 1^. tr' If it goes without saying, as according to my inter- pretation it does, that such persons are in all matters subject to the jurisdiction of the British Consul Just the same as British subjects not in Ilis Highness*s employ, then there is no need to include any provision in that direction in the new Treaty^and I may add that the question has not been raised in any way during my term of service here, so that the insertion of any such provision now might seem to the present Sultan to be somewhat gratuitous. On the other hand if it is not a wel understood thing that we do not give reciprocity in this matter, and if from a legal point of view the absence of any special provision would enable the Su tan to claim reciprocity or to improperly protect any- British sjibject in his 1 eirip 1 oy against whom thif Consulate had any Civil or Criminal Claim, then it would be better to make the point clear by Treaty, ■ Referring to the Declaration of 1891, by which Seyyid Jeisa. 1 engaged for himself and his heirs and successors not to alienate any portion of his Territory except to the British Government, it will be observed in the correspondence preceding it that the late MarQuis of Sa3,isbury did not consider that such a course would be open to protest on the part of France as being a violation of the Declaration of 1362, It will be remembered however that at the time of the Bunder Jisseh incident the prench Consul did as a matter of fact impugn the validity of this eclaration and was apparently supported by his Govern- Sj ment, I am not aware what is the status of the said Declaration TVDec laration at; t/he present; time, as between the i^renoh Government and ourselves, but if they have had due notice of it and have not been able to establish any argument as to its invalidity, it might be considered desirable to include the declaration as an article in the New Commercial Treaty. (HI) Alienation of the Muscat Customs . It might also be possible to insert a dec aration analogous to the foregoing by which the Sultan would undertake not to lease ( or mortgage his Customs Revenue to any one but ourselves and not to employ in the direct or indirect administration thereof the subjects of any power save his own and those of the British Government. (IV) The question of the obligatory use of Manifests for vessels exporting goods from Muscat has been mooted before ( vide this office letter Nos.255 &amp; 29*J of 1337 to your address ) and proved to be ■i a failure^ but it would be a pity that we shoul d let the present occasion pass without devising some means by which our position in relation to the arms trade would be improved, if that is poss- -ible short of the abrogation of the French Treaty. iUrv*- 1 i H p V ■ f r . I suggest some such provision as the following; It K |5 4J- A ' shall be obligatory for All munitions of war ' in course of re-export by sea from Muscat or ' any Oman port at which Customs duties are or 'may in the future be collected by the Sultan or ' his Wal/is^to pass through the Customs House, ' and to be covered by a Pass setting forth in English and ArabictUll details as to the brands ' quantities and details of the arms shipped. ' The Sultan further agrees to cause to be kept M up regular records and statistics of warlike ' stores so exported, and undertakes to place■'of 'the Consular Officials of. Foreign powers accredit 'i&gt;ed to him M , I am doubt;fill whether the 1 ast condition would be fea sible but it does not seem that the French could resonably object to the rest. I took a recent opportunity of referring incidentally to the Treaty in course of conversation with the Sultan, and His Highness said there would be one or two alterations which he would like made when the time came for renewal., and when I when I asked in what direction, replied, ' Nothing particu- 'lar or of importance; only petty matters which we can discuss 'when the time comes'• I can only offer conjectures as to the nature .of the modifications he comtemplates asking for, by attributing them to items which have from time to time in my experience been the cause of difficulty. Two occur to 'me. /v Firstly ' Referring to Article 9 . The pption of paying in cash or in kind rests in our Treaty, with the British Subject, and the Sultan has from time to time com plained that traders on occasion stand on their right of option and insist on paying in kind upon goods which cannot be divided without much waste of time, anjft for which, if the Sultan accepts the payment in kind he has no ready means of disposal, or space for storage. The French Treaty of 1344-46 now in vogue leaves the option with the Customs Superin- . -v tendent and I think on the whole Articles 12 and 15 of that Treaty are of more practi cal expediency than Article 9 of ours, and that the adoption of similar terms might be 1 considered if the Sultan raises the point. SecondlySecondly Questions are from time to time being raised as as to whether certain godds are in the status of ' under transhipment'- One case you will remember was referred to Govern ment, ( vide correspondence ending with Foreign Department No,2562 E.A.of S4th. December 1900) and other cases have since arisen not quite an- -alogousjbut in the same connection. His Highness will probably ask for some modifi cation of the wording of the article in order (o eliminate any ambiguity which may appear to him to exist, (5) I have the honour to inquire incidently whether it would not be possible for the Sultan to move for the abrogation of the existing French Treaty and substitution of a new one. So far as appears in the version of it in Aitchison's ^Treaties no limit of time is put on it, but surely it is understood that in the nature of things such treaties become out of date, and it would seem to be a very reasonable thing for the Sultan to move for a revision of it on these grounds. (6) In conclusion I venture to express the opinion that the decision of the Hague Tribunal in the matter of the fla^ is likely to affect to some extent the attitude and and temper of the Sultan in referenceto any addition^which we may want to insert in the new Treaty in the interests of British subjects, so that it might be well to adjust the date of the opening of negociations in connection with the Treaty with due regard to the probable date of the finding of the Tribunal; that is to say it would be to our interests a to discuss a new Treaty Just after the verdict of the Tribunal if that had gone against the Sultan*and vice-versa.

With respect to the suggested insertion of a reference in the Treaty extending our protection to Goanese subjects of Portugal the Government of India consider it inadvisable to adopt the proposal, and are of opinion that there are no reasons of any political importance which call for a revision of the orders con tained in the letter from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, lo, 1468 E., dated the 14th July 1890. 3.

Should a British vessel be wrecked off the coast of His Highness's domi nions, the authorities of His Highness shall render all assistance in their power to the distressed vessel, in order to save the vessel, her cargo, and those on board; they shall also give aid and protection to persons saved, and shall assist them in reaching the nearest British Consulate; they shall further take every possible care that the goods so recovered are safely stored, and kept for the purpose of being handed over to the owner, captain, agent of the vessel or British Consul subject always to rights of salvage. His Highness's authorities shall further see that the British Consulate is at once informed of such disaster having occurred.4 Should a British vessel, wrecked on the coast of His Highness's dominions, be plundered, the authorities of His Highness shall, as soon as they come to knowr thereof, render prompt assistance and take measures to pursue and punish the robbers, and recover the stolen property. Likewise, should a vessel of His Highness, or of one of his subjects, enter a British port in distress or be wrecked off the coast of His Majesty's dominions, the like help and assistance shall be rendered by the British authorities. A rticle XII. Should sailors or others, belonging to a British ship of war or merchant vessel, desert and take refuge on shore or on board of any of His Highness's ships, the authorities of His Highness shall, upon request of a Consular official, or, in his absence, of the captain of the ship or his representative, take the necessary steps in order to have them arrested and delivered over to the Consular official or to the captain. In this, however, the Consular officer and the captain or his representative shall render every assistance. A rticle XIII. British subjects shall, as regards their person and property, enjoy within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan the rights of exterritoriality. The authorities of His Highness have no right to interfere in disputes with British subjects amongst themselves, or between them and members of other Christian nations; such questions, whether of a civil or criminal nature, shall be decided by the competent Consular authorities. The trial and also the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused within the dominions of His Highness, also the bearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims, or disputes in which they are the defendants, is expressly reserved to the British Consular authorities and Courts, and removed from the jurisdiction of His Highness. Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness or any non-Christian Power not represented by a Consul at Maskat, and a British subject, in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complairant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan, or some person specially delegated by him and approved by His Majesty's Consul for this purpose. The proceedings and final decision in such a case shall not, however, be considered legal, unless notice has been given and an opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his substitute to attend at the hearing and final deci sion. A rticle XIV. Subjects of his Highness the Sultan, or of any non-Christian Power, not represented by a Consul at Maskat, who are in the regular service of British subjects within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, shall enjoy the same privileges as British subjects themselves. Should they be charged with having committed a crime or serious offence against the Sultan's Government or subjects of His Highness not being in regular British employ, they shall, on sufficient evidence being shown to justify further proceedings be handed over by their British employers, or by order of the British Consul, to the authorities of His Highness for trial and punishment. A rticle XV. Should a British subject residing in the dominions of His Highness be adjudicated bankrupt, the British Consul shall take possession of, recover, and realise all available f roperty and assets of such bankrupt, to be dealt with and distributed according to the provisions of English Bankruptcy Law. A rticle XVI. Should a subject of His Highness the Sultan resist or evade payment of the just and rightful claims of a British subject, the authorities of HisEigbness shall afford to the British creditor every aid and facility in recovering the amount d le to him. In like manner the British Consul shall afford every aid and facility to subjects of His Highness, in recovering debts justly due to them from a British subject. In cases where defendants, subjects of either of the two High Contracting Parties, shall plead insolvency, a mixed committee, composed of not less than three and not more than five respectable merchants, to be agreed upon between His Highness and the British Consul, shall be appointed to verify and certify the bond fides of such insolvency before it is accepted as a fact by His Highness or the British Representative. A rticle XVII. Should a British subject die within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, or dying elsewhere leave property therein, movable or immovable, the British Consul shall be authorised to collect, realise, and take possession of the estate of the deceased, to be disposed of according to the provisions of English law. A rticle XYIIL The houses, dwellings, warehouses, and other premises of British suhjecte, or of persons actually in their regular service, within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, shall not be entered, or searched under any pretext, by the officials of His Highness without the consent of the occupier, unless with the cognisance and assistance of the British Consul or his substitute. A rticle XIX. It is hereby agreed between the two High Contracting Parties that, in the event of an agreement being hereafter arrived at between His Highness the Sultan and the various Powers with which His Highness shall be in treaty relations, including Great Britain, which must be a consenting party, whereby the residents of a district or town shall, without distinction of nationality, be made subject to the payment of local taxes for municipal and sanitary purposes, the same to be fixed and administered by, or under the control of, a special Board, nothing contained in this treaty shall be understood so as to exempt British residents from the payment of such taxes as may in like circumstances be payable by the subjects of His Highness. A rticle XX. Subjects of the two High Contracting Parties shall, within the dominions of each other, enjoy freedom of conscience and religious toleration, the free and public exercise of all forms of religion, and the right to build edifices for religious worship. A rticles XXI. The stipulations of the present treaty shall be applicable to all the Colonies and foreign possessions of His Majesty so far as the laws permit, excepting to those hereinafter named, that is to say, except to :— The Dominion of Canada. Newfoundland. The Cape of Good Hope, nsr ciijcii New South Wales. New Zea Victoria. Queensland. Tasmania. South Australia. Western Australia. and. Provided always that the stipulations of the present treaty shall be made applicable to any of the above-named Colonies or foreign possessions, on whose behalf notice to that effect shall have been given by His Majesty's Represent ative in Maskat to His Highness within two years from the date of exchange of the ratifications of the present treaty.6 A rticle XXII. The present treaty has been executed in quadruplicate, two copies bein^ written in English and two in Arabic. These are understood to be of similar import and signification ; in the event, however, of doubt hereafter arising as to the proper interpretation of the English or Arabic text of one or other of the treaty stipulations, the English text shall be considered decisive. The treaty shall come into operation within one month after the date when the ratifications may take place. A rticle XXIII. After the lapse of ten years from the date on which this treaty shall come into force, and on 12 months* notice given by either party, this treaty shall be subject to revision by Plenipotentiaries appointed on both sides for this purpose, who shall be empowered to decide on and adopt such amend ments as experience shall prove to be desirable. In witness whereof on behalf of His Majesty the King of the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the seas.

Grkt , I.A., Officiating Political Agent, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. I have the honour to forward a copy of Foreign Department letter No. 4i52-E.B., dated 1st February 1905, regarding jurisdiction at Maskat over the subjects of Christian Powers having no Consular representation in the Sultan's territory, and-to add the following remarks with reference thereto. 2. On page 11 of the draft Maskat case for the Hague Arbitration, of which you have received a copy under this office endorsement No. 7 of 28th January, it is stated, with myself as authority, that there have been up to the present very few French citizens in Maskat, and that at the time when the case for arbitration arose there was in Oman only one French citizen (Goguyer) outside the Consular Establishment and 'one citizen of a Christian State not having a Consul at Maskat who was treated as being under the French Consul.' The person referred to was the late Monsieur Bevidion, the Eussian Armenian, and representative of the Odessa firm of Kever Koff &amp; Co. 3. As far as I remember this individual, when he first came to open a branch in Maskat, brought credentials to the French Consulate and looked to that Consulate for protection in his business affairs. His title to protection by the French Consul, if he so desired, was not I think ever questioned by the Sultan ; and while I was in Maskat never came into prominent issue. When Bevidion was drowned last summer in Maskat harbour, I think I remember being informed that his effects were taken posses sion of and his estate wound up by the French Consul. In this the Sultan must, no doubt, have acquiesced. 4. I would turn now to the clause on page 24 of the draft Maskat case wherein it is stated, though in brackets as if its inclusion was doubtful, that the Sultan of Maskat has always been prepared to accept French jurisdic tion as attaching to subjects of a Christian Power not having a Consul at Maskat, who have registered themselves at the French Consulate there.' The words 'has always been' seems little sweeping from the fact that cases in point have been so extremely rare. In my own experience 1 can only remember one other instance besides the case of Bevidion, of a foreign subject taking advantage of the good offices or protection of the French Consulate, namely, that of Count (or Major) Leontieff and a companion who paid a visit to Maskat about three years ago, and, if I remember right, approached the Sultan always through the French Consul. 5. With regard to the concluding paragraph of the Foreign Department letter under reference, I have no knowledge of the Sultan ever having actively indicated his preparedness in the direction suggested.I take it, however, that unless h e had special reasons for objecting and resisting in a particular case, he Would tacitly accept witliout question the protection or, at all events, the good offices of any of the Foreign Consuls at Maskat in favour of the subject of a Christian power not Consularly represented. 6. The foregoing observations have been set down from memory, and can only be checked from the Maskat records. I have the honour to request that you will do this, and that after adding any further information which you may be in possession of, you will submit the result, together with your own views, direct to Government, sending a copy to me. As you will probably be absent for some time after this letter reaohea Maskat, I am sending a copy of it to the Poreign Department as an ad interim reply to their reference. U. It C.

Lord Lansdowne is asking the Secretary of State for the ColoniesColonies and the Board of Trade respectively whether they have any observations to offer on the subject* Meanwhile I am to request that the Treaty may not be signed without the previous authority of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It is desirable that in future no steps should be taken by Political Agents holding Consular appointment for the revision of the treaty arrangements betwwen H»M.

The stipulations of the present treaty shall not be appli cable to any of Colonies or possessions, beyond the seas unless notice to that effect shall have been given on behalf of any such Colony or possession, by His Britannic Majesty's Representative at Muscat to the within one year from the date of the exchange of the ratifications of the present Treaty. It is understood that, under the provisions of this Article, H.M* Govt* can, in the same manner, give notice of adhesion on behalf of any British Protectorate or sphere of influence, or on behalf of the Island of Cyprus in virtue of the Convention of the 4th June 1878, betweeen Great Britain and Turkey.

I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the , .iJ-y receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo (No. 123) with its enclosures, relative to the revision of the Commercial Treaty between this country and Maskat, and asking for observations of the Board thereon. In reply, I am to state that, in addition to the points to which the attention of the India Office has been called in Sir E. Gorst's letter of the 11th ultimo, the Board con sider that some modifications are required in respect of the following articles:- Article IV. The Board note that there is no provision in this article with regard to coasting trade, and they are of opinion that it is highly desirable, if possible, to keep open the coasting trade of the Kaskat region and at the same time to reserve freedom of action as regards British coasting ■ trade. They would therefore suggest subject to Lord Lansdowne's approval, that the following words should be added at the end of the first clause of this article, namely:- 'The coasting trade of Maskat and Cman shall remain open to British vessels'. Article VI. Clauses 1 and 2. The Board are also of opinion23^ that some alterations should be made in the wording of the first two clauses of this article, so as to remove any possible ambiguity as to the duties leviable on British goods. They would suggest that these clauses should be modified so as to read as follows 'His Highness the Sultan shall be permitted to levy a duty of entry, not exceeding 5 per cent, on the value of all goods and merchandise of whatever description, imported by sea from foreign countries into His Highness's dominions. This duty shall be paid at that port in His Highness*s dominions where the goods are first landed; and, on payment thereof, such goods shall thereafter be exempt within the Sultan's dominions, from all other duties or taxes, levied by, or on behalf of, the Government of His Highness the Sultan, by whatever names these may be designated; and no higher import duties shall be levied on goods of British origin or claimed from British subjects than those which are levied on goods of other origin or paid by subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation. The Customs duty, once paid, shall cover from all other charges on the part of His Highness the Sultan, good of whatever description coming from any part of His Majs st dominions or the property of British subjects, whether the are intended for local consumption or for transmission elsewherei- / elsewhere in bulk or otherwise, and whether they remain in the state in which they are imported or have been manufactured' I have, etc., Sd/- H.
