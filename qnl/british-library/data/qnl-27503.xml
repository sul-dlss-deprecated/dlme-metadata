Dear Mr. Donaldson, Harrison probably told you that I visited him on the 16th December to speak about the Iraq Kuwait boundary at Umm Qasr. For convenience I attach a copy of anote which I recorded after that interview. I hope it is reasonably correct but, if not, the fault is entirely mine. . J r I write now to mention that the possibility of ohe Basrah Petroleum Company wishing, at some later and appropriate stage, to use Umm Qasr still exists, and is perhaps a probability although clearly it depends upon the location of Oil Fields in * that area, if any. There seems, however, to be a case in favour of settling frontier questions as soon as may be and preferably in advance of any special urgency such as would be presented by the construction of our loading port. One feels that a Frontier Commission immediately before the initiation of major work on the spot affected, would give rise to suspicions on both sides, however unjustifiable. It would therefore be very satisfactory if some early move in the direction of a boundary settlement could be taken. Do you think this at all likely? J Yours sincerely. J f v-T E.P. Donaldson Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, WHITEHALL. S.W.l. ENC: *—Hr-9,9^ (3b ' J r^V v^- 1 l) In 1941, the Iraq Grovernment eimbarked on a cimpaign of propaganda in the press and on the radio against 1 Kuwait, aikd it was thought at one time that she had designs of annexation of the Shaikhdom preceded by the familiar axis methods of propaganda and peaceful penetra tion. There followed the Rashid rebellion and some time in 1941 Paiforce announced their intention of developing Umm Qasr near the Khor Abdulla (and situated on the Iraq Kuwait frontier which has not yet been demarcated on the ground) as a port. The proposal immediately aroused the Shaikh Kuwait ’ s suspicions as he thought (and probably with some reason) that the suggestion emanated from the Basrah Port Directorate. Shaikh Ahmad (of Kuwait) claimed that the site of the port selected by Paiforce was within his territory and that his permission to the use of the approaches via Khor Abdulla was, in any case, necessary. It was eventually agreed that the Army should utilise Umm Qasr on condition that the installations should be removed at the end of the war in order to obviate a claim by Iraq or Kuwait to ownership, and this was accordingly done to the extent that the light railway from Zubair (?) was taken up, the water pipe line remaining in situ and the jetty being abandoned to the depredations of the local scavengers who proceeded to dismantle it and sell the timber in Persia and in Kuwait. Umm Qasr is within Iraq territory according to Sir Percy Cox’s letter to the P.A. Kuwait (Aitchison Vol.XI page 266) and Article 7 of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of the 29th July 1913, but its limits on the ground are undefined and open to dispute. 2) Accompanied by Mr. Bird, I called on Mr. Harrison, Commonwealth Relations Office, this morning to make certain enquiries regarding Umm Qasr near the Khor Abdulla. Mr. Harrison confirmed that the selection of Umm Qasr by the Army during the late war had led to claims from the Shaikh of Kuwait (supported to some extent by the India OfficeAuthorities) regarding his ownership of that area or part of it. Mr. Harrison agreed that Sir Percy Cox’ letter of the 19th April 1923 (Aitchison Vol.XI, page 266) read with Article 7 of the ioiglo-Turkish Agreement of the 29th July 1913, which defined the boundary as passing 'immediately to the south of Umm Qasr', did not enable the exact position of the boundary to be settled, and he suggested that operations in that area before a final demarcation of the boundary would be certain to raise complications and were, therefore, inadvisable. Mr. Harrison gave me to understand that a Kuwait-Iraq boundary settlement was under contemplation but could give me no idea as to when it would commence as the 1.0. and u.ri.O* had somewhat conflicting views on the question which would obviously have to be reconciled before a settlement was suggested. He agreed that from the commencement to the conclusion and ratification of the work of a boundary commission, it was more than probable tnat a period of at least two years would elapse. I understood Mr. Harrison to agree that the use of the Khor Abdulla and approaches to Umm Qasr would require the permission of the Shaikh of Kuwait in so far as his rights in the waters were concerned. 16th Dec.1947.V V SXTERNAL Department.

This case has prove d a difficult one in that it has been impossible to reach agreement with the Foreign Office on a fair interpretation of ^ the definition of the Kaw*it-Iraq frontier accepted by b#*h parties ^ A ' in 1923 and re-affirmed by them in 1932. The position as it stood in 1942 was summarised in Mr. Lumby's note of the 18th June, 1942 (flag A). At that time it was considered that, as no agreement could be reached with the Foreign Office on an exact interpretation of the frontier, the matter should be allowed to ' u ' (f until after the war. The Foreign Office raised the matter again in their letter of the 7th August, 1947, in which they enquired whether we and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf agreed that an attempt should be made to reach agreement with the Iraqi Government on the basis of the 1940 formula. They adhered strongly to the view that, if agreement with the Government of Iraq was to be achieved without resort to arbitration, it would be useless to approach them with any formula less favourable to them than that communicated to them in 1940. It has been our view that this 1940 formula has been shown by subsequent research in the Gulf to be unfair to KowCit and we therefore asked the Political Resident in our letter of the 18th September to consider whether in view of the circumstances he considered that there would be any objection on his part to arbitration. It was pointed out that while arbitration would have the disadvantage in that it might be attended by a certain amount of publicity of an undesirable kind, it would have the advantage of enabling us to put forward the further evidence in favour of the Sheikh of Kuwait which has emerged since 1940. Both the Acting Political Resident and the Political Agent Kuwait agreedthat arbitration appeared to be the only course, but Sir Rupert Hay in his letter of the 26th November expressed the view that we should first try to make up our own minds on the way in which we understood the definition of the frontier, and that having done this we should make a further approach to the Iraqi Government. ^h e Foreign Office will shortly assume responsibility for the conduct or e«r‘relations with Kuwait. They wish to avoid arbitration, and it would therefore seem that the decision on a fair interpretation of the definition of this disputed frontier will rest with them. It is to be hoped that, when they become responsible for protecting the Sheikh’s interests in such matters, they will be disposed to take more fully into consideration the arguments which had been advanced on the Kowait side. It is suggested therefore that the time has now cone to place this matter in the hands of the foreign Office and I submit a draft accordingly. The need for the early demarcation of his frontier is emphasised by the possibility of Unan Qaer being selected by the I*P. C. as an oil terminal for their Tankers. Longrigg of the X,P.C. .informed us today that should oil be found in the Basra region, his company would have to chose between the Shatt al Arab and Uram Q&amp;er for establishing a port for their tankers and that to avoid congestion and the need for constant dredging, the latter might well be preferred. * 9 &gt;n .ew IVW4V/0 ERAPT LSTTSR Ssq«, Eastern Department, foreign Office, &lt; London, S.W. 1. li r JAN '• X 1 spare) to the Political Resident in the perarian Gulf* t TVJ* Would you please refer to correspondence about the ^oweit-Iraq frontier reabirjg with Galloway* s '^Tetter Tfo*;!?^-^ of ^th^pt &lt;5b^ 2 * I now enclose a' lett er' !To* 2021-S' oF Che • i v&gt; 26th November from Hay; in which 'He gives his views on the suggestion made in Harrison’s letter .to, &gt; 5 Saj 2 ITo* 3xt*l699/if7 of the 18th September that the dispute be referred to arbitration* - u 3.

I have heard from Tandy that he agrees with Galloway* s views. 3. My own view is that we should not at present lightly surrender any territory in the vicinity of Umm Qasr even though only a few square miles of desert are concerned. If any port is constructed at Umm Qasr - I have no information whether the Iraqi Government are still keen on this project - it will certainly assist matters if * fa wait has some say in the proceedings as will have to be the case if it is necessary for some of the port build ings to be constructed in her territory. Further the oil potent ialities of 'chis region are not known and this is an additional reason for not surrendering any territory though I should not attach very great importance to it if there were no prospect of Umm Qasr*s ever being developed as a port. 4. I do not knov/ whether it is in my province to express any opinion about tactics in this case but I would suggest that arbitration should only be resorted to if no other course appears possible. I presume that in any case the Iraqi Government will be asked in the first place whether they are willing to take up the question of demarcation now, and that before even this is done the Shaikh of Kuwait will be consulted. I would suggest that if the Iraqi Government reply in the affirmative we should present them with a reasonably-large scale map showing them the line we claim on behalf of Kuwait under the definition of the frontier as re affirmed by the Prime Minister for Iraq in his letter No.2944, dated the 21st July 1932, to the^High Commissioner for Iraq vide Annexure No.VIII to Wakefield*^j^ote a copy of which was forwarded c with my letter feul81-S of 20th December, 1941. Whether this j definitiorrshouTd^be interpreted as proposed by vVakefield in his note or by me in my letter No.0-78 dated the 10th Marob^ 0 r in some other manner will first have to be decided. If the Iraqi G Government then propose the 1940 or some other line we can presumablv argue with them and should I think in any case consult the Shaikh of Kuwait before proposing arbitration. E.P.

I have not yet received Tandy’s views, which I called for, but I am recording mine briefly as it was I who not only obtained the Shaikh of Kuwait’s agreement t© the draft of the 1940 formula, but in 1941 reconnoitred the area by land and air and (without any records to work on) reported to the General Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq, on the position of Umm Qasr in relation to the frontier. Hay will doubtless report further on receipt of Tandy’s views. 3. I agree that if we wished to negotiate we could not approach the Iraq Government with any formula less favourable than that put to them in 1940. To do so, however, would be to ~ admit the Iraqi claim to the port site of Umm Qasr. My own opinion is that while Umm Qasr and the site as projected in 1941 should be regarded as being in Iraq the 1940 formula gave to Iraq in this sector more than should have been conceded. I am therefore against negotiation, and agree that arbitration is the only course. As you mention, this would also enable us to adduce the further evidence in Kuwait’s favour which has emerged since 1940 (in Wakefield’s report, forwarded under Hay’s demi- official letter No.lSl-S, dated the 20th December, 1941). The possibility of the Iraqis making claims more extensive than their succession rights as defined in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 (e.g. to the low tide lefel of the right bank •f the Khor Abdulla, giving them full control of the waterway, or even to the islands of Bubiyan and Warbah themsftlves) and producing strong evidence in favour of such claims, will have to be faced. * 4. The procedure suggested in the last paragraph of your letter appears to be the most satisfactory. We should have to obtain in advance the Shaikh's undertaking te abide by the award. * F.A.K.

As far as the frontier of Koweit andyArabia is concrmed, the definitions of the 1913 Agreenent were abandoned as early as 1922. If^as both Mr. Vfakefield and Col. Hay suggested^ our attitude should be based on historical research into what the position oltthe ground was intended to be in 1913 and again in 1923, we should perhaps bear in mind the advisability of discovering the international force of the 1913 Agreement and we should also consider that the 1923 Agreement was affirmed by the High Commissioner of a British Mandate in agreement with the Sheikh of a British Protected State. I fancy that at that time Sir Percy Cox^ writ ran equally in Iraq and Koweit. I imagine that the 1932 formula which was agreed on Iraq*s entry to the League of Nations may be the first that has any international force, although it was itself something in the nature of a domestic arrangement within the British Commonwealth. ^ TU Ur fct **#«-•* 1# oWjt i/w ft- (WbtA/fc.1 &amp; uw tw, ■C £&amp;Ur* «3fc-«A lfc.Lt. 1H JLw. o-« •)»*•+. ^Lt. ^ol.

Youf \ \ * will remember that both the India Office and the Government of India agreed with the Foreign Office in the territorial interpretation of the 19A0 formula, which the Iraq Governmait declined to consider on purely specious grounds.

Wakefield and Hay we came to the conclusion that the rvni terms of the 1940 formula mam far too generous to Iraq. The matter rested with the provisional decision that during the period of the war the administration of Urn Qasr should be pureljy military. It is now generally agreed here that it would be most unwise to let the question of frontier denanfcation drift on indefinitely. If the 1940 formula is adopted, presumably the SheikLof Koweit will lose the site of the port at Um Qasr. ^his may possibly be outweighed by the oIW advantages he will obtain in regard to suchythings as the prevention of frontier infringements and the division of oil rights. If the Iraqis receive Um Qasr and comjej^t it into a working port I imagine that it would have a fair chance of replacing Koweit as a port of entry for croods in transit^ I am not very clear what the present position is with regard to Um Qasr and whether it could be readily w*U*CX so converted, and I should be gfia^£ul to learn what is the actual position thereto.fr ^he momeawk S u&gt;om|JL ^ OWiu. d Yours sincerely. w£&gt;Clearly the next step is to consult Colonel Calloway. It may well be true what the Foreign Office say, that it is no use putting to the Iraqi Covernment anything less favourable than the formula. Tais, nov/ever, will apparently mean that the Sheikh of Koweit will lose the site of the port of Unm Qa^fe. From, the practical point of view the question may turn largely on whether tae general advantages/in regard to such things as .prevention of frontier infringements and division of oil rights will outweigh this loss of Umm QajJrffc* The military port taere was abandoned apparently because in the experience of the military it turned out to be useless as a site for a port, but on the other handyis the -mibassador pointed out in iiis letter of 12fth January^it is the only place in which Iraq could have a port free from the danger of silting up and the ccmplications inherent in an international waterway- such as the Shatt-al-Arab. On the other hand I remember it having been, stated somewhere that the development of Urnm Qs^Ht as fiwpSrt would probably be disastrous for Koweit since it would replace K owe it as a port for the entry of goods in transit (presumably to Saudi Arabia and Iraq). Could you please put up a d.o. letter to Colonel Calloway and show it to Mr. Hallows.n r-l Kuvyait - Iraqi Frontier The recent history of this case has been briefly as follows. In 1940 we agreed with the Foreign Office and the Government of India that an approach should be made to the Iraqi Government (j?*Z.6Q35 of 1940) based on the 1932 formula, which was in itself a repetition of the 1923 formula^ which * Sir Percy Cox agreed with the Sheikh of Kuwait. These various agreements are detailed in the Annexure to Mr* ftakelield s Report at Flag A. Accordingly, the Iraqi Government were asked to agree to a demarcation of the frontier, which they declined to do on specious grounds* 2. In 1941 the question was raised again in connection with the construction of a military port at bin Qasr. After much correspondence it was agreed to waive the demarcation for the time being and to administer the port on a purely military g basis. By 1942, however, a certain amount of fresh evidence had been discovered, largely by Mr* Wakefield and Col* Hay, which led us to believe that the terras of the 1940 formula had been far too generous to Iraq. The correspondence with the Foreign Office ended in a deadlock, the India Office point of view being summarised in the letter at Ext.23959/42 of the 16th June, 1942, to Baxter. Our contention was that as the 1940 formula and the earlier statements, i.e. 1938, 1932 and 1923, were all interpretations of Article 7 of the Anglo - Turkish Convention of 1913, which was in itself ambiguous, we were at perfect liberty to produce a new formula if we considered it to be the most accurate one obtainable. Hflfir The Foreign Office disagreed with us on the grounds that had already made definite proposals to the Iraqi Government in 1940 and could not in consequence offer as a basis for negotiation any new interpretation which might prove less favourable to Iraq. 3* The most convenient summary is to be found on the sketchmap at Flag B, which shows ,roughly y the different frontiers which Kuwait would receive under the various formulae. The/■■■■■■■Ml * 4, The question was raised again last year, when it became apparent that additional palm groves were being laid out to the south of Safwan; and as for many years 'the most southerly palm in Safwan had been taken as an agreed boundary mark*, it became more Important than ever to ensure that the ftontier was not pushed further and further south at the expense of Kuwait. 5. In the view of the Political Resident, nothing is to be gained by delaying a demarcation of the frontier• Indeed, the following factors make it desirable to obtain as speedy a demarcation as possible (a) Iraqiincursions into Kuwait territory still continue• ,(b) The Tin Qasr port project appears to be dormant for the moment and so unlikely to complicate demarcation operations. (c) It will be far harder to obtain a just settlement for Kuwait after an amendment of the present Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. (d) Oil has not yet been discovered near the frontier, and it is desirable to have a demarcatfejli. frontier before any oil operations are likely to start. 6. I feel that as the Sheikh of Kuwait will rely, as he did in 1932, entirely on the good offices of H.M.G. to ensure that Kuwait does not suffer from the demarcation of the frontier, it should be put to the Foreign Office that as the Iraqi Government did not even consider the 1940 formula, there is no reason whatever why a proposal more favourable to Kuwait should not now be put forward. ^o.*** 1 ' *1.EXPRESS LETTER PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, Department.

In 1939 the then Political Resident was of &lt; the opinion tnat a demarcation of the frontier would render less likely Iraqi incursions Into Kuwait for which his Majesty's Government had been able to obtain no satisfaction, vide Residency tel egramJfo.80 dated the 29th January, 193 9 and Residency express letter rA \n rs. - a fto*C/94 dated~the 22nd F ebruar?/ 1939. Since then the ^ incursions have continued and we have been no more successful in obtaining satisfaction for the Shaikh; and this in spite of the fact that there have been British advisers attached to the Iraqi Police who have done their utmost to prevent such incidents, and in spite of the presence in Iraq since 1941 of British forces and a pro-British Government. In my view nothing has occurred since 1939 to make a demarcation of the frontier any less desirable. 3. Should there oe in the future, as a result of the revision of the present treaty with Iraq or for any other reason, no British advisers, or advisers of some other nationality, in Iraq, I anticipate that the situation would become much graver. I understood from Colonel Sargon of the Iraq Police on his visit here two years ago that, as his police were incapable of reading or understanding a map, there was little prospect of their respecting the frontier until it was demarcated. 4. Both the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Kuwait Oil Company are fully occupied in developing promising oil fields at some distance from the frontier, but it is probable that when proved fields are fully in production intensive exploration at new levels will be begun and the companies may then take an active interest in the frontier area. Demarcation would seem likely to proceed more smoothly now when the area is not considered vitally important from an oil point of view a than at some later date when this position may have changed. 5. The limm Qasr Port project appears to be dormant for the present and therefore unlikely to complicate or embitter the demarcation operations. 6 . The frontier where it follows the Batin is marked by an unmistakeable natural feature and it would seem that demarcation here is not urgently required, provided that Iraq agrees that it follows the thalweg and '■ u : M f&lt; Mw-yl. ■■■ t (X( 4-4 Sl| 'ii® •~ 2 — r x r fe '0 and Instructs her/ officials accordingly, Sinilj the froxiLjLei‘ Oiice ic i*eacues t/ie xuior Abuullaii does not seem to require demarcation. The section where incidents have occurred in the past and arc most likely to recur in the future is the comparatively short one between the Batin and the Khor Abdullah, the demarcation of which would uot, I suggest, present any considerable physical difficulties, or involve much expense. 7. It is clear that the accurate definition of tiie frontier will present questions on which Iraq and Kuwait are unlikely to agree - notably the problem of how far south of Safwan n just South” is. This question, however, seems tc have been considerably narrowed by the admissions contained in the Iraqi note of the 25th June 1940, forwarded to you with Baghdad Embassy despatch &gt; 0 u o.360/10/40 ciateti the S7th June 19 4C and the other questions arc unli.keiy to more acirte now than they were in 1939. 8 . The Shaikh 1 s attitude will probably be just as it was described in Colonel Dickson 1 s letter No. 80 dated the 7th June 1232 and it is probable that he will endeavour to take a minor part In the demarcation and to take anelter behind his Majesty’s Government from the slings and arrows of the Iraqi Nationalist Press. 9. Iraqi objections to demarcation in the past appear to have arisen from the hope that they might at some future date annex part or all of Kuweit should British influence in the kiadle East and Britisn support for the Shaikh of Kuwait decrease as a result of developments elsewhere. It appears that Iraq may demand revision of her treaty with Great Britain with the object of -efibereasing her influence in Iraq, and, should this happen, I regard it as of prime importance that we should make our consent to suen revision conditional upon a satisfactory demarcation of the Kuwait-Iraq frontier. 10. The only objection that I can see to demarcation is that it might arouse or accentuate ill-feeling between the parties. In my opinion this objection should not be allowed to prevail unless his Majesty*s Government are certain that British influence in Iraq ano^friendliest relations between Iraq and Kuwait, and Iraq and his Majesty’s Government will remain indefinitely.

If it is really to the advantage of the Shaikh of Kowait not to raise the question of his frontier with Iraq I entirely agree that we should take no action which might prejudice his position and incidentally give us all a great deal of trouble. I am not however quite happy about the matter. The Political Resident’in-the Persian Gulf stated in his express letter ho 476-S of April 2lst last to the India Office that he reared the frontier might be moving southwards if any significance is to be given to the phrase 'most southerly palm in Safwan'. It is true that the India Office in paragraph 5 of their letter number XT2359/42 of June 16th 1942 (your registry ho E.36.39/134/ 93) reject it entirely, but it is a phrase known io me Iraqis and might be claimed as the only possH&gt;le alterna tive to agreement on the site of the notice board. In this case it is surely to the Shaikh's advantage to get the frontier delimited at that point as soon as possible. Then there is the question of the port at Umm Qasr which continues to have attraction for the Iraqis. If they could be persuaded that it is utterly useless as a site for a port - as it is, according to the experience of the British army - then delimitation there would not matter. But we cannot forget that it is the only place where Iraq could have a port free from the perpetual danger of silting up, and from the complications inherent in an international waterway, and they may not be easily persuaded. Finally there is the perennial trouble about violations of the frontier by police of both sides in search of smugglers. Delimitation would help to put a stop to continual bickering about this, which is, incidentally, one of the four main 'questions' between Kowait and Iraq in the opinion of the Political Agent. In short it seems to us that inaction may possibly favour Iraq more than Kowait — that is, on the information available to us here. Before we abandon the matter sine die I should be grateful therefore if you would consider once more consulting the India Office and the Political Resident. I note what you say about oil, but this is nevertheless to my mind another most important reason for delimiting the frontier. Oil Companies are far from infallible, as we Know to our cost in connection !. ,V. Baxter, Esq., C.M.G., M.C. , Foreign Office, London S.W.1 /withwith Bahrein, and if oil were found there would, in the absence of a fixed frontier, at once be very serious trouble between Iraq and Kowait. In general, I must also confess to the view that it is thoroughly bad policy to leave frontiers undelimited in the faint hope that no one will ever raise the question. Frontier problems are always raised sooner or later and, if we wait until the question is a burning one, a settle ment is ten times more difficult, if not impossible. If we do it now we could probably fix the thing quietly and without fuss. Surely you do not wish to wait until tempers are so high that a settlement by agreement is impossible and the whole dispute has to go to U.K.O.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 9th December, 1946.

We have looked again into this question, which, as you say, is complicated and contentious. It is uni ortunately not merely a question of demarcating a frontier which has been clearly defined and accepted by both parties: it is the actual interpretation of the definition of the frontier which is in dispute. There is, however, at leas a reasonable hope that the problem will not be further complicate^ by the discovery of oil deposits in the vicinity.

The frontier in the neighbourhood has never been delimited and nobody quite knows where it runs. The Iraqi authorities have produced a port regulation, and one of the questions for consideration is what steps will have to be taken to safet uax'd the rights of the bheikh of Koweit in this connexion. But we shouio also like to discuss at our meeting the far more important question of the port’s future. We shall therefore be glad to know whether the Admiralty have any views on the subject. It seems to us arguable that, as a deep sea port on the Gulf, it may be so valuable to us that we may have to make special arrangements after the war to retain the use of it for our own purposes. As you know, we cannot count on using the Persian ports in the Gulf as post-war bases. The question really is whether there is a case for making it plain to both parties in the dispute, i.e. Iraq and Koweit, that, while we are fully disposed to assist m securing a delimitation of the frontier, and while we are quite ready to hold the port on lease from one or both of them, we do nevertheless propose to hold it. Perhaps, when you communicate the admiralty's views, you would state whether you wish to attend the proposed meeting. I am sending copies of this letter to Admiral Bellaire, of the Military gub-Committee, to Haviland at the war Office and to Peel at the India Office. fours sincerely, (Sgd) C.w. Baxter. Colonel R.V.

L A With reference to your letter to Goss of the 16th May, 3036/46, explaining the significance of the phrase ’’The most southerly palm in Saf-wan” we have enquired fron the Chief Geologist of the Anglo-Iranian, who also controls the Anglo-Iranian’s activities in Kuwait, whether the question of the exact alignment of the boundary between Iraq and Kuwait is likely to be affected by the discovery of oil. He has told us that so far the geophysical results do not indicate any attractive geological structures close to the boundary. It seems likely therefore that the exact position of the boundary will not be comjDlica^ed by the discovery of oil, though this cannot be hfiefie Tor all time.

Political Agency, Kuwait* December 19, 1938. My dear Sir Trenchard, Will you please refer to letter No.307/15/38 of 24th November 1938, from His Majesty*s Antoassador, Bagdad. The fact that the new map shows the place, ifwrongly spelt, as in Iraq makes our contention more difficult to support, but I myself have little doubt that the Qaqaiyat water-point is in fact in Kuwait territory, and that whenever demarcation is carried out, it will be found to fall within Kuwait territory. 2. The mistake has probably risen through the water hole having given its name to a tract of the same name. It is quite likely that part of the tract is in Iraq. The water point, a mere couple of holes, not of importance as a v/atering place, is in the southern part of it, being approximately East South of that very striking feature JEBEL SANAM, which is presumably correctly fixed on the map. The Arabic name, QAQIYA, can it appears mean a ”Clash of arms, or a gnashing of teeth”, but to Bedouins may, I gather, also connote an area of qoft or sand dunes, repelling to travellers. It is presumably because of the difficult “going” in the dunes that the car patrol of the SAFWAN Police has, I hear, quite often taken a southerly course round the dunes, and past the water hole, thus going into Kuwait territory, instead of taking a slightly longer route further North. The Hon*ble Sir Trenchard Powle, k.c.i.e.,c.b.e.. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.Local Arabs convinced me that they do this, and pointed out to me their well marked wheel-track, going from SAFWAN towards UMM QASR, and passing the hole. It seems to me therefore that it might he pointed out to the Iraqis that, as far as can he told v/ithout special survey, the Qaqaiyat tract is partly astride the frontier, hut that the water hole of the same name is south of it; and that, pending demarcation, the Kuwait Police will at this place avoid penetrating the Sand dunes North of the water hole, and the Iraq Police should avoid the Qaqaiya water point; an arrangement which would of course he entirely without prejudice to eventual decision, after a detailed survey for demarcation, hut which should at least prevent any H clash or arms” in the meanwhile.

The black lines on the tracing are copied from the Admiralty charts drawn from the latest surveys received, and the red lines have been traced from the map. The river mouth is, of course, subject to constant change. The Admiralty also wish to support the suggestion that the issue of the maps should be delayed a few months, so that the new frontier (if one is agreed) off Abadan may be shown. We also agree J.C. Walton, Esq.., C.B. , M.w. , India Office, S.W.l.

BRITISH EMBASSY, BAGDAD. 3rd May, 1937. My dear George, Although I have not myself taken up the matter with the Iraqi Government, Edmonds has, I find, been going ahead on his own regarding the demarcation of the Koweit-Iraq frontier. He thinks, and I agree, that it would be tidier to have the frontier demarcated and certainly, when enquiries have to be made about frontier incidents, it would be a great help to have the line marked on the ground. The enclosed copy of a note, which he has put up to his Minister, shows the lines he is working on, which I think are generally sound, and you will see that his suggested interpretation of the established frontier follows closely the proposals contained in your despatch No. 43 (E 7061/127/91) of January 22nd, 1936. I expect that with the hot weather coming on there is likely to be some delay before any practical work can be undertaken, but the Iraqi Government may raise with me in principle fairly soon the general question of demarcating the frontier. When they do so, I shall send you a despatch but, in the meanwhile, any ideas which you may have will be welcome. I am sending a copy of this letter to Powle. Yours ever (Initialled) A.C.K. G. W. RENDEL, ESQ., C.M.G.Note No. 480 H.S. (through D.G.I.) Further to my note No. 154 of 9th February, 1937. 1* The following are the minor points of interpretation on which I suggest the Shaikh of Kuwait should be invited to agree: a) In the Batin the frontier line follows the thalweg, i.e. the line of deepest depression. b) The ’’point just south of the latitude of Safwan” shall be a point due west of a point situated one mile south of the palms of Safwan. c) From the Batin to the neighbourhood of Safwan the frontier is a straight line running due east to the above-mentioned point one mile due south of the palms of Safwan. d) The junction of the Khor Zubair and the Khor Abdullah means the junction of the thalwegs of these two waterways. e) The frontier from the above-mentioned point south of Safwan to the above-mentioned junction of the thalwegs is a straight line joining these two points. f) From the above-mentioned junction of thalwegs to the open sea the boundary follows the thalweg of the Khor Abdullah. (Note: The above proposals in fact confirm the existing practical interpretation. There is on the Zubair-Kuwait road about one mile south of Safwan a board marking the point where the road crosses the frontier). 2 . We should also invite the Sheikh of Kuwait to agree that the demarcation shall be carried out on the same lines/i 6 lines as those suggested for the demarcation of the Saudiya frontier, i.e* a) Completion of the network of triangulation along the frontier zone, where the triangulation is defective. b) Formation of a joint commission to erect pillars, which shall be intervisible, the whole length of the boundary. (These pillars shall be similar to those erected on the Syrian boundary and proposed for the Saudi boundary viz H section iron bars driven into the ground with a pile driver). 3. I have already, in a note concerning the demarcation of the Saudi boundary explained the technical processes involved, and there is no need to repeat those explanations here. I cannot propose a time-table for the work at present. This depends on whether my proposals for the Saudi demarcation go forward, in which case the available Iraqi technicians will be fully occupied, and on whether in this case the British authorities, on behalf of Kuwait, can assist by undertaking the necessary preliminary triangulation. But there is no need to enter into this question until agreement in principle has been reached on paras 1 and 2 above. Intld.

We have no observations to make as regards the Koweit frontiers, but a few points have occurred to us as being worth consideration in connexion with the Perso-Iraq.i frontier. These are as follows:- (i) If the map is to be published, or re-published (I am not clear whether it has yet been on sale to the public), we think that the opportunity might be taken to substitute 'Iran” for ,, Persia ,, in the title and explanatory notes, provided that this can be done without inconvenience. (ii) As you are aware, the frontier between Iraq, and Iran is likely to be modified by a treaty which may be concluded (but not necessarily ratified and brought into force) before more than two or three months have passed. IV M.J. Glauson, Esq,.It has occurred to us that the Government of India might consider it at least worth while to wait two or three months to see if it is concluded, in which case it would be worth while waiting a little longer till it took effect and incorporating the alterations in the frontier in the revised sheets. (iii) In any case, the frontier as shown in the existing proofs fails to take account of the great changes at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab which have occurred in the last few years. Various surveys of the topography of the river and its mouth have been made from time to time by Colonel Ward, and full particulars regarding recent changes can be obtained from the Admiralty. (iv) Finally, (in the absence of a new treaty which can be followed), the Irano-Iraqi frontier, whether the map is changed or not as regards the mouth of the Shatt, should be shown as following closely the left bank until the open sea is reached (which it does not quite do at present , the frontier line on the contrary veering out into tne centre of the stream at the mouth). 3. The Government of India might care to consider whether it would not be worth undertaking a fartherm i * revision of the proofs in the light of the above observations. There certainly seems something to be said for bringing the map completely up to date v/hile they are about it. 4. I return to you herewith, as requested, the proof copies of sheets No. l/tt 10, 10 B and 10 C.Please reply to :— Officer in charge. XiEGGRAPjnCAL SECTION, GENERAL STAFF, 3^ Ref.

I have examined Major Papworth’s original field sheet of this area. Arq (v/hich, according to Major Papworth is more correctly spelt Arg) actually falls on one of Papworth’s traverses fairly close (about 10 kilometres distant) to one of his control points. We feel, therefore, that there is no doubt that the oosition as shown on our 1/500,000 sheet Basra—Kuwait is correct. Incidentally, the letter from the Government of India makes the statement that Arq is shown as Arga. on our map. Actually if you will look at the map again you will find that it is shown as Arg, approximately 5 miles south-west of another well which is shown as Arga. Yours sincerely, aJ'^ M.J.

It will be seen that Sheet 1/M 10 has been corrected as suggested by Captain de Gaury in his express letter No.C-332, dated the 13th November 1936. The Surveyor General of India does not however consider that Arq (Arak) should be shown south of the Neutral Zone boundary. He has pointed out that in the War Office map * Basra-Kuwait 1 * on the scale of 1/500,000, which has just been published, Arq (shown as Arga) lies considerably ... fSEbo- 901. OEM. | 15 MAR 133?.

He has accordingly suggested that the proper course would be to move it slightly north to agree with the War Office map. The Govemment of India agree with the Surveyor General and if His Majesty^ Government approve of his suggestion Sheet 1/M 10 will be corrected accordingly. « 2. I am to request that the Govemment of India may be informed whether the Surveyor General may now be authorised to proceed with the publication of these sheets.

According to the Convention (page 21 of publication quoted above) the line should run through 'Ain al Abd. 2* In addition I would add the following comments:- (a) There is no second light house at Kuwait, only the one at Has al Ardh. The more northerly one marked should be deleted* (b) Khor al M&amp;kt&amp;i MAKTA'A should be spelt Khor al MAQTA* (See Neutral Zone South-East comer), like the Island of the same name which is correctly spelt. (c) All sea-faring man inform me that in MAQTA' area there are three Khors. two having Debouchment North of Has Khafji Khor al AMI ) Known together as al KHIEftN Khor MAPATTAH ) and • • •and one known simply as al MAQTA', being the largest and deepest, and having its debouchment into the sea 'Near' and North of Has MISHA*AB. In other words the al MAQTA* probably is South of the Southern frontier of the Neutral Zone and not North of it. If the map remains as marked at present and in certain circumstances, it seems to me that there might easily be confusion and dispute. It would therefore be best to delete the name 'Khor al MAKTAA - from the Sheet altogether, it being at present both wrongly placed and wrongly spelt. Sd.

The interpretation of the frontier proposed in Foreign Office despatch to Bagdad of 22nd January No. 43 (enclosed in India Office d.o. letter to Dickson of 24th January P.Z. 249/36, copy of which was sent to you by air mail of 25th January) seems to be generally acceptable, •jinles.s Fowle has_any_iiiQre - to say. We therefore suggest that the Survey of India might now proceed to prepare their map showing the frontier line which has been agreed upon and marking 'Hulaiba' (both in uprights and in italics) on the Iraqi side of the boundary. You will notice that both Clerk-Kerr and the Foreign Office (see enclosed copy of letter) attach importance to this point. We think it would be as well for the Survey of India to forward a proof of their map to us before printing it, so that we can fcjM. iux be sure that no discrepancies arise A between it and the War Office map.

You will see that the Ambassador attaches considerable importance to having the word ’’Hulaiba” clearly marked on the Iraqi side of the frontier, both in the case of the waterhole and in that of the hill. If you see no objection to this perhaps you will call the attention of the Government of India to this point in order that they may do as the Ambassador suggests when they come to print theii* nev/ map. 3.

The Iraqi Government, of course, know that the oil of Kuwait is now being exploited and have heard rumours that oil-bearing formations have been discovered close to the frontier.

Apart from the subject matter of your letter, and on a small point, I note that it is addressed direct to Dickson, with a copy to me. As you know, having regard to the special circumstances prevailing in the Gulf, and in order to save time, I agreed to copies of communications from the India Office, and some other Authorities outside the Gulf, being sent direct to Political Agents (vide correspondence ending f with Laithwaite f s demi-official letter N o.P.Z.100 1/35 of the 15th February 1935) instead of through me, which of course would be the ordinary procedure. I note that in your letter you ask Dickson to put up his observations through me, so no harm has been done, but a case recently occurred (vide demi-official letter No.317 of the 11th February 1936 to Caroe, copy sent to C3a uson under my Printed Letter No.318 of the 11th February 1936) when de Gaury put up a proposition for a cypher clerk direct to the India Office instead of to me, and in order to avoid confusion I think it would be more in order if all communications were addressed to me, with copies to the Political Agents. 3, With regard to the matter dealt with in your letter. De Gaury has now taken over from Dickson, and will have to reply. I am writing him to consult Dickson on the matter. I / J.C.Walton Esquire, CB.,MC., The India Office, -—-— \ London. REGo.

That is to say if one tnkur&gt; thetaka the centre line of the 3at in t o be the frontier, the sold 'wella which lie in the Batin depression itself will be found to be just Inside Iraq. 4. &lt;ihan writing my despatch Ko.C-262 of 27th august 19o5 f I confess freely that I had this map before me, which from close jersonal knowledge of the Batin valley, I knew to be far more accurate then the old Basra Million sheet, whi&lt;fc we have aH hitherto worked on. You will further observe that Major i cpworth himself in his map (which I gave you and which you have in the Bushire Office) has placed Hulaiba about one mile inside Iraq. As a matter of fact X am of opinion that Major rapworth has here gone slightly wrong with his frontier line and should have drawn it (the frontier line) from oaf wan in a due westerly straight line until it struck the centre line of the Batin, after which it should have followed the centre line of the Batin, as he has correctly made it do as far as „i ^uja in the south. In spite of this personal view of mine, however, Hul&amp;iba would still fall just inside Iraq territory by a hundred yards or more. 7. In view of my above remarks X think that r .M # 8 ambassador will perhaps appreciate that my suggestion as regards fixing the centre line of th Batin as the frontier was not made lightly, and certainly with no intention to gain something for Kuwait at the expense of Iraq. I kno* the Batin district well, perhaps better than any living person today and the frontier line as proposed by me was one which I considered not only the fairest, but one least likely to cause future argument a' heart burning. The advantage of such line would, I think, be at once admitted by H.U* a .uabaseador himself if he were himself to see it on the ground, especially as throughout its entire length there ia today a deep ano clearly defined motor car track made by the B.A./. in ,which aa near as possible forms an artificial demarcation line.

The question has been carefully considered'by the various departments concerned and the results of the discussion have been embodied in the Foreign Office Despatch to Bagdad, a copy of which is enclosed, along with a jhMmap, showing the relevant parts of the country. 3 The interpretation of the frontier which it is now proposed to adopt involves two slight modifications of the line drawn on the map enclosed. / a Firstly, between Hubila and its intersection with a line running due eastweydc aid westwapdo, the frontier will be drawn slightly to the northwards of the line shown on the map. Secondly, from the point 1 mile |south of Safwan the frontier will be drawn in a straight line to the ti*ibo fv.-junction of the Khor Zubair, the Khor iShetana and the Khor As Sabiya,j.a muasmu instead of the alignment shown on the map. The proposed line seems to agree with the local opinion as stated in your letter under reference.

In the absence of any Indication that tho ncoition of this signboard is disputed locally, His Majesty‘ft Government regard tho point at which the frantici should leave the Batin (Mufra&amp;h) as lying a similar distance south of the latitude of Safwan, and they consider that the frontier should thence proceed duo eastwards.

Careful examination of tha results of the recent survey do not suggest to Hie Majesty’s lovernment that any material nolnt oan fc© involved. T.

(E 7061/127/91) V$ dear Saimny, Will you please refer to correspondence ending with Major Papworth’s letter to me of the 2nd Decemher (of which I sent you a copy on the 4th Decemher under our No.E 7061/127/91) on the subject of the Koweit-Iraq frontier? 2. iifter our meeting at the War Office on the 22nd November, Heap produced some admirable sketch maps of the frontier, based on the latest survey. Two copies i are enclosed. I have since had some further discussion with Heap (delayed first by his leave, then by mine) about the marking of the frontier from Safwan South- eastwards to the Persian Gulf. The definition of this sector is regrettably vague since 'the junction of the •Khor Zubair and the Khor Abdullah' is not at all easy to determine The Viscount Hoodm* determine. The line which appears on the enclosed sketch maps is unsatisfactory as it does not rest on any principle of interpretation hut was, I understand, simply adapted from older maps. 3. At the same time the vagueness of the definition does not seem to have caused any difficulties locally. You will remember that paragraph 7 of Dickson^ letter No.G/262 of the 27th August makes no comment on the point. 4. Nevertheless we have to draw a reasonable line on our official maps. Bearing in mind the fact that the line must in any case continue round the north of Warba Island, it seemed to Heap and me that, subject to the views of the India Office, His Majesty’s Government snould recommend that ^the junction of the Khor Zubair and the 'Khor Abdullah 1 * be interpreted for cartographical purposes as meaning the tri—junction of the Khor Zubair, the Khor Shetana and the Khor as-Sabiya. The frontier would thus be shown as a straight line joining this point to a point■ ■ t 13$ m point 'about a mile” South of Safwan. 5* As arranged at the meeting on the 22nd November I now enclose the draft of a despatch to Bagdad, the main lines of which need no explanation. Koweit must of course be consulted and we would suggest that the India Office might send Dickson a copy of the despatch when it has gone off, with a copy of the sketch map, and ask for his observations. Then, when the British authorities concerned are in agreement, it will clearly be desirable to give the Iraqis a chance to concur. We do not feel that either party is likely to make difficulties if His Majesty’s Government give a firm lead. 6. Will you let me know fairly soon whether the India Office agree with the terms of the draft? 7. I am sending a copy of this letter to Heap.Registry NoB 7601/127/91 /'S ■w y F. 0., January ,193$. nt. Draft. Sir A. Clark Kerr* Bagdad* No Sir, With reference to correspondence ending with your despatch No. 578 (377/9/35) of the JK)th October, regarding the alignment of the frontier between Iraq, and Koweit, I have to i nform Your Excellency that the matter has now been considered by the interested departments of His Majesty’s Government with spacial inference to the results of the survey recently c arried out on that frontier by personnel of His Majesty’s Forces. A copy of a sketch map showing the relevant parts of the uncompleted :/500 f 000 map based on that survey is enclosed for your information. 2. As you are aware the definition of the Aoweit-Iraq. frontier reads as follows:- 'From the intersection of the Wadi al M AudJa with the Batin and thence northwards ’’along the Batin to a point Just south of the ’’latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passir 'southtt. V 1 ft south of Safwan veils 9 Jebel Cazm and Um w Qaar, leaving them to Iran and so on to the | M function of the Khor Zabetr with the Khor M Abdullah”• As you pointed out in paragraph 7 of your despatch under reference, the frontier as defined above was intended to be identical with the frontier defined in the Angla-Turkish Convention of the 29th July# 1913, and shown as green line on the map attached thereto* 3# This green line, which you suggest should be most carefully reproduced on all official maps on which the frontier between Kowelt and Iraq, appears, is represented as following the centre of the Batin* Hie Majesty’s Government are of opinion that in the absence of any other indication in the text, this is the proper construction to be placed upon the words ”along the Batin”• The Batin, however, is now known to follow a winding and not, as shown dn the 1913 sketch-map, a virtually/* . S' 1*7 virtually rectilinear couree. Hie Majesty's Government do not therefore regard it as practicable to adopt more than the principle exemplified toy the w green line** of 1913* For analogous reasons they regard as erroneous the frontier shown on the 1923 sketch-map referred to in paragraph 4 of your despatch, since al though the course of the Batin is there shown as irindlng, the frontier is shown as straight. 4. His Majesty's Government have closely examined the question raised in paragraphs &amp; and 5 of your despatch,namely the effect on . \ the political attribution of Hulaitoa of drawing the frontier-line down the centre of the Batin. Although this water-hole is not mentioned in any of the instruments defining the frontier or on the map attached to the Anglo-Turklsh Convention of 1915» it WDuld indeed appear from the sketch-map of 1923 that it was intended to Leave Hulaitoa in Iraq, as before. it/It is understood fro® Major Papworth, E.S* # who conducted the recent survey, that the name 'Hulalba* in upright characters on the enclosed sketch-map refers to the small hill which is marked in the bed of the Batm about one mile to the East of meridian 47° 16* Easts and that the water-hole Itself (to whieh the name * n italic letters refers) is situated very slightly to the east of the above-mentioned hill. In the light of this information His Majesty's Government are satisfied that the frontier if drawn down the centre of the Batin, as in the broken line on the enclosed sketch-map, would not leave Hulaiba in Koweit. 5. Careful eonsideration has also been given to the question of the interpretation to be placed on the words *northwarde.««.••••*• ••••••to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan wells, Jebel Sanau*•••••*' etc* You are no doubt aware that the Batin, as6 ./ &gt; • A m vhS' 1 b shown on the enclosed sketch-map, is continued to the north-east of Hulaiha by a prolongation or delta, called Mufrash. His • .Jfc, , , i A ^ '' J Majesty's Government are of opinion that the words quoted above must be taken to mean that ' A . • %** ' • «. . . i j % - ^ * . . j ' ’ &lt; ' the frontier-line should continue down the centre of Mufrash (not, as on the enclosed sketch-map 9 down the eastern side) until it reaches the prescribed point “just south of the latitude M of Safwan”. The Political Agent, Koweit, has stated that there is a signboard marking the frontier at a point one mile south of Safwan* In the absence of any indication that the position of this signboard is disputed locally. His Majesty's Government regard the point at which the frontier should leave the Batin (Mufrash) as lying a similar distance south of the latitude of Safwan, and they consider that the frontier should thence proceed due eastwards. They note moreover, that according to Colonel Dickson, this is the interpretation locally accepted*t 6 « From Safwan to the Persian Gulf, His Majesty*a Government see no reaeon to dissent from the frontier line which the Political Agent at Koweit has Indicated as being locally accepted 9 namely 9 a straight line from a point one mile south of Safwan to the junction of the Khor Zubair and the Khor Abdullah, although there is room for doubt as to the exact way in which this line should appear on a map* The line representing this sector of the frontier on the enclosed aketoh-map has been based on older maps and Is not, in the view of His Majesty*s Government, the best line which can be deduced from the definition* In their view this line should be drawn straight from a point a mile south of Safwan to the tri-function of the Khor Zubalr, the Khor She tana and the Khor as-Sabiya,since this point represents as nearly as possible the junction of the Khor Zubair and the Khor Abdullah* Careful examination of the results of the recent survey do not suggest to His Majesty’s Government that any/any material point can be involved. 7. In general 9 ae you will observe 9 this drawing of the northern sector of the Koweit Iraq frontier has the general support of the mpps attached to the 1913 uiglo-Turkish Con vention and to the print of the 1923 exchange of letters referred to in paragraph 4 of your despatch. The curve by which this vector has hitherto been represented on the ^International' Asia map on a scale of LAtOOOrOOO issued by the War Office does not appear to rest on any formal agreement and sannot even be regarded as an illustration of Local practice 9 still less 9 of course 9 as an nuthoritative interpretation, of any existing :.nstruaient. 3. I shall be glad if 9 subject to your views and to those o. the Political Agent at A ioweit (to whom a copy of this despatch is being sent by the Secretary of State for India), you will, at an early date, approach the Iraqi Government in whatever manner you think best and/and endeavour to obtain their concurrence in the marking, on future maps, of the frontier as indicated in the preceding paragraphs.INDIA OFFICEOn His Majesty’s Service?

My references to this boundary are in ny heavy baggage in storage, so what I write below is from memory. I shall be in town either on the 4th or 5th, and will go to the War Office to see my original field sheets to confirm this reply, and I wil; then ’phone you to see if it is convenient to arrange a meeting. Koweit-Iraq 3oundary I believe no mention is made of Hulnibu in any of the various definition • In the original treaty with the Turks, Koweit territory was defined as a semi-circle (! mox*e properly aa part of a circle) with Koweit town aa centre. I think the boundary as marked on the 1/a map was a debased form of this circle; hence the curve aa the boundary left the Batin. The definition as quoted by you says ’Eastwards’ and not ’due East’. We more or less copied the boundaxy aa shown on the l/m map. ’Mufrash* is arabic for ’ spreading-out’ and is, as you say, a sort of delta to the Batin. I see no difficulty in placing the boundary as you suggest, continuing it down the centre of the Batin and Mu fresh until it reaches a point just douth of the latitude of Safvvan and then turning due East. The v:ign-post referred to by Colonel Dickson is just about 1 mile i outh of Safwan. duiaibn . # . A. Malcolm, Esq., The Foreign Office, Whitehall S. .1Hulalba My impreoeion is that the depression where rain-water collects is some quarter of a raile Ye t of the centre line of the Batin. Consequently, if the boundary is defined as above, the water pool would remain in ’Iraq. During the two years I was working in this part, I do not remember tribes using this place and I think it is only used by caravans going along the B* tin between ubair and Saudia. I will confirm thio from the field aheets. I will ’phone you, either the 4th or 5th and if it is inconvenient to meet, I will write again. Incidentally, ere there any other queries with the other boundaries? Yours sincerely, (Signed) K. M. Papworth..—Delineation of the Koweit-Iraq Frontier* The Government of India in their letter at P-Z.4532/35* suggesWthat the 'boundaries between Koweit and Iraq and between Koweit and Nejd should in future be shown on Survey of India maps. No objection was seen to this proposal here, and we accordingly replied (P. Z.6426/35) that the boundaries might be shown on' un demarcated frontiers, and that a note should be added stating that the boundaries had been defined, so as to remove any erroneous impression that the boundaries were merely approximate. A divergence of opinion has now arisen as to the exact alignment of the Koweit-Iraq frontier. Colonel Dickson, in his letter at P.Z.$586/35* made various suggestions as to how the frontier should be drawn, but his suggestions have now been questioned by Sir Archibald Clark Kerr (see Baghdad despatch immediately below). The facts of the case are as follows: The frontier between Koweit and Iraq was defined by Sir Percy Cox in his memorandum of 19th April 1923 (see P.1775/23) as follows:- u From the intersection of the V/adi-el-Audja with the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan Wells, Jabal Sanan, and Um Qasr, leaving them to Iraq and so on to the junction of the Khor Zobier with the Khor Abdulla”. Sir Percy Cox otesosis: stated in his memorandum that this definition was intended to be identical with the frontier/&amp; 2 . frontier indicated toy the Green Line of the unratified AngloConvention of 1913 (Article VII of Part V). The 1923 Convention was re-affirmed word for word in 1932 The description of the frontier is thus clear enough, tout its alignment on the various maps available in the Office is toy no means uniform. / The 1923 map attached to Sir Percy Cox’s memorandum must clearly toe discarded, as the westerly boundary does not follow the Batin, and runs northward to a point at which it appears to toe actually north of the latitude of Safwan. Tfeo map 'qf -tlie Intiinn General OtaffT -a-ttaohed W the Military Report of the Persian (lulf does not appear to toe reliable, as it draw§, two separate lines for the 1914 tooundary^nrd^he present boundary rupp o &gt;■». -rmiXy r which is o^ftgiLy wpeng. The map attached to the 1913 Convention interprets the definition of the frontier correctly, tout it is on such a small scale, and contains so few geographical features that it is not much use as a basis of discussion. The new map of the country adjacent to the Koweit-Iraq frontier, which will shortly toe published toy the geographical section of the General Staff on a scale of 1:500,000, should toe very useful, tout at the moment the War Office are proposing to mark the frontier along the lines suggested toy Colonel Dickson. It will toe desirable to prevent them doing this, and to examine the results of their survey before any boundary is decided upon. It is unfortunate that this doubt as to the correct frontier has arisen, as the present arrangements seem to have worked perfectly satisfactorily. However, as the/I f • j-H 1 /f3 3. the Koweit-Nejd frontier is in future to he marked upon Survey of India maps, I suppose the Koweit-Iraq frontier must also he marked. I have discussed the qiestion with Malcolm and we have decided that representatives of the Foreign Office and India Office shall go over to the Y/ar Office to-morrow afternoon and discuss the question with Captain Heap. It will then prohahly he necessary to instruct the Government of India to hold up matters for the time being. -Za• ' mt (877/9/35) 30th i Ctober, 1935, &amp;lr v With raforenea to your dospatoa Ko. 6d3 (&gt;: &amp;62a/ 127/91) of uotoh^r 9th # I jrMTfo th% honour to offer the following oboervtttioruft on the praposaltt put forward in tho doopateh fro» tho ^olitioal .gent, Kuwait, JSo* 0-262 of .iUguat 27th» to the Political ..,.&lt;*oident In the x'oralan Gulf 9 rogardirig tnc frontier between Kuwait and Ira**.

Your Excellency will note that the description of the frontier line as given by the Iraq Prime Minister follows exactly the words used by his Excellency Sir Percy Cox, in his memorandum of the 19th April, 1923, to the Political Agent, Koweit, when laying down the line which the boundary between the two States followed. As your Excellency is doubtless aware, the words of Sir Percy Cox in describing this line were as follows :— “From the intersection of the Wadi-al-Aujah with the Batin, and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan Wells, Jebel Sanam and Um Qasr, leaving them to Iraq, and so on to the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Kohr Abdullah.

In view of the above, I would ask your Excellency to be so good as to let me have the necessary official letter, confirming that you agree and accept the frontier line between Iraq and Koweit, as laid down by Sir Percy Cox in his aforesaid letter to the Political Agent, Koweit, and as now described by his Excellency Nuri Pasha-as-Said, Prime Minister of Iraq, in his secret letter dated the 21st July, 1932, to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq. v Usual ending.)

I enclose a copy of a note by the 'fr IAaaj (jul HU. STD C ( ^ Asst. Librarian ^na of Dickson’s reply. The Asst. Librarian informs me that Dickson's suggestion that tne word 'daf' is more probably a mistake for the word ’’jar* is unlikely to be correct, and that it is most improbable that a local or colloquial worn such as M jal' would be used in tne Arabic version of the treaty document, which is written in tne classical language. On the other hand, it appears that tne nsst. Librarian’s own suggestion that the error may be tne employment of 'dal' for » II til*' is, for the reasons given by Dickson, equally untenable.The Library. 6.10.1934. Mr. Laithwaite I am afraid that the M Handbook of Arabia” to which I referred in my last note does not help us here, as far as the point quoted in that note. The description goes on: (Dhula* el-Mi‘aijil.) It is uninhabited, but yields most of the grass and firewood sold in the town of Koweit... The ”Handbook of Arabia' was compiled in 1920 though, before the Nejd-Koweit agreement. Certainly at that time the whole of Shaqq was considered the territory of Koweit. There is no doubt at all that the treaty describes El Shaqq (in its Arabic version) expressly as a dal* and if this word is correct, it is a most unfor tunate description, as the word is generally conceded to signify a 1 low mountain-ridge ? . There is another curious meaning assigned to the word by some lexicogr aphers, *a line which is made on the ground, after which another ]ine is made, and then fhe t space between t these two is sown f : I have mentioned this interpretation because of the reference to 'grass and firewood contai ned in the passage from the 'Handbook of Arabia quoted above. But I have no confidence that the word can be given this signification here. Dickson is absolutely right in his contention, as his excellent sketch-map shows: and my purpose in proposing to read tiV for glal‘ was purely in order to support his thesis. ‘'I still believe that the word til 6 is a good description of the geographical feature called El Shaqq:3.

I can well imagine the delight which international lawyers would have in tackling the pro blem, and to them I am afraid I must leave it. I am sorry that I cannot suggest anything else. (Um-— r*11 The Library, India Office. 5.10.1934. MKj Laifrhia}.fr&amp; In continuation of my note of this, morning on the question raised by Lt.-Ccl. Jornioiffi?! of Koweit, I have just come across the following passage in: A Handbook of Arabia, Volume I. (Compiled by the Geographical Section of the Naval Intelligence Division, Naval Staff, Admiralty), p. 292: (Sultanate of Koweit)...The districts of the interior are the following... Shaqq . a shallow valley, perhaps 80 miles long from N. to S., and on the average about 10 miles broad between Umm Janeib on the E. and Dibdibah on the W. It ends on the N. about 20 miles NW. of Jahrah, and is bounded on the S. by Dhula 6 el-Mi‘aijil... The word Dhul‘ here is the same as &lt;Jal 6 ( ) which occurs in the Arabic version of the treaty: it there fore seems possible that this is the solution of the difficulty. I wonder if I might have another look at the correspondence and the copy of the Arabic, so that I may see how this information affects the issue f.Ill (VU) The Library, India Office. 5.10.1934. Mr. Laithwaite. ^ I have read Lt.-Col. Dickson's interesting letter, and would like to make the following observations on it: 1. The Arabic version of the treatv-document is written in the Classical language, oy some per is wn oueil Hi one Uiciosieeu. uv o'-zms/ son, presumably an Arab, who knows the language well: sufficiently well, that is, to observe the very strict rule - any departure from which^would be anathema to an educated and self-respecting Arab - that in writing Classical Arabic on no account must colloquialisms or local dialect-forms be used. (There has oeen a long wrangle over tnis issue among the Egyptians of the present day, more advanced thinkers being inclined^to laxity over the matter, much to the bitter recrimination of the conservative tradition represented by the Azhar: as the Arabian Peninsula is the home or Arab conservatism, it would be unthinkable that such an advanced idea should have carried any weight there). With all due deference to Lt.-Col. Dickson, therefore, I think we may dispose of any suggestion that a local or colloquial word, such as 'jal*' which he suggests, is at all relevant. 2. Lt.-Col. Dickson is quite mistaken in identi fying the word 'til 6 ” ( - which I suggested - with 'tel' ( Ji-)! The words are entirely different, and have no etymological connection of any kind. The latter word ( i** ) does indeed mean a ’'hillock', as also does the word 'thalaat' ( ^') which he quotes in para. 3 of his letter. But I do not think we are anxious in this case to find a word meaning 'hillock'. 3. Lt.-Col. Dickson's misapprehension arises from his confusing the word 'til 6 ' which I suggested with 'tel', as I have pointed out above. It was quite2 . /21 diD clearly stated in my note to you, and in your letter to him, that the word 'til‘” t ^ ) means *a depressed piece of ground having in it a hill from which it is P oss ik3- e uo see all round*: for this meaning of the word, which is of course purely classical, I can give references to Lane*s Araoic-English Dictionary, and to the Lisah al-‘Arab and the Taj al-‘Arus, which are the two largest and most esteemed native dictionaries. Now it seems to me that that meaning fits in very closely with the description of El Shaqq as given by Lt.-Col. Dickson, and illustrated in his map. The ’depressed piece of ground* is there all right - that is El Shaqq itself; and the *hill from which it is possible to see all round* is also there - he speaks in para. 7 of 'the X&amp;A series of low ridges lying 4 to 5 miles to the East of it'. 4. Philby is a man of wide and deserved reputation for his knowledge of modern Arabia: but of his know ledge of Classical Arabic I am not in a position to speak. He might be able to throw some light on the matter, however. J&lt;\ know how these military gentlemen ( have a profound contempt for the 'armchair-scholar' !' 5. The suggestion in para. 8 of Lt.-Col. Dickson’s letter may be xihe true solution: I should think it would be fairly easy to ascertain. If so. then there the matter ends: if not, then I still stand by my suggested emendation.P.Z. 6156/34. D.O. 37, QUEEN' 3 GATE GARDENS, 357. 7. October 1st 1934. Ity dear Laithwaite, 7/111 you kinaly refer to your note to me of 27th September 1934, re&amp;araing the question oi the error in the description in the Kuwait Neutral Zone Convention of 1922, of the Western Boundary of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. 2. With all aue deference to the assistant Librarian, I ao not tnink that tne Arabic word 'aaT ” is a mistake for Hil' ” , which he describes as meaning 0 * ,l a depressed piece of ground having in it a hill from which it is possible to see all rouna 1 '. It is much more likely, in my view, to be a mistake for the commonly used Bedouin word u jal n , which is used extensively in Nejd, Hassa, and Kuwait for a long low ridge, (for example, Jal al Liyah, Jal al Zor, which are to be found north of the Bay of Kuwait ana on the road to Basra from Jahara). 3. Hie word 'til” or 'tel' undoubtedly means a small hill, usually of conical shape, in Arabic, but although it is extensively usea in Palestine, Syria and Iraq is certainly not usea in Kuwait or Nejd, as far as I know. There the commonly accepted worn to denote such a feature as a small hillock, cone shaped, is 'thalaat' or 'thalaiyat' its diminutive, (exainpl s Ihalaat al Dhaba, Xhalaiat as Sur, botn well known hills 3.W. of Kuwait and west of the Neutral Zone respectively). The Bedouin also use the term '’Idairat' for a small peak rising out of a ridge (example 1 laairat al Hussin, laairat al Harndth), but I do not think we need bother our heads about this latter. 4/2 IV 4. One thing is pretty certain, in Bedouin nrahia a whole host of terms are used for natural features such as dry water courses, hills, depressions, flat open spaces without vegetation, pehbly ground, rocky ground, etc., etc., which are either not found in dictionaries, or have been so mutilated as not to be recognizable with their counterpart in the dictionary. I\ man like philby who is an Arabic scholar could probably say how and from what classical Arabic wora these Beaouin expressions have been arrived at, but I am afraid my' knowledge does not go as far. b. To return to our subject. As the arable text says that the 7/e stern Boundary of trie Neutral Zone is ,l a low mountainous ridge called shaq (al Siiaqq)', there clearly is an error somewhere, for as I explained personally to you, the shaq is a wide shallow depression anything from 2 to 5 miles across according to location, with not a vesti&amp;e of a hill or rise in its bed, through out its whole length - indeed it is so shallow throughout most of its length that in many parts of it the untrained eye cannot detect where tne western side begins and ends. 6. It is true that a series of low ridges and isolated hillocks run down the Eastern side of tne shaq as far as the Neutral Zone is concerned (as per sketch oelow) out as these lie generally speaking anything from 4 to 5 miles away, ana as they bear other names such as ,l Jeoel Fuwaris', 'hrhaiya'', etc., etc., one cannot claim that they have anything to do with the 'shaq' depression proper. 7/- 3 - (m) 7 • One thing is quite clear to us in Kuwait, from the sheikh downwards - the centre line of the shaq' 1 is understood to he the Western boundary of the Kuwait Neutral Zone, ana I believe Bin Saua ana his people recognise this also, ana the only reason why I originally drew the Political Resident's attention to the curious mistake in the text of trie Kuwait Boundary Convention of 1922 was that, as it stood, it offered an opportunity to Bin Saud of possibly some day attempting to encroach on the Neutral Zone from the west by laying claim to the strip of country lying between the Eastern edge of the Shaq and the series of low ridges lying 4 to 5 miles to the East of it* Such a claim would appeal greatly to the Nejdi mind. 8* I personally think the mistake originally was due to tne fact that Englishmen or an Englishman (probably Colonel Lore) drafted the original Boundary Convention in English, without having any personal knowledge of the ground, ana guided by tne million sheet map of Arabia only, ana it was then translated into Arabic for the approval ana signature of the negotiators of the Convention. It would be quite easy for a person not knowing the ground ana looking at the map to think that the Shaq was a low hill. In fact I na^e known more than three Englishmen who nave made the same mistake when reading the map. The latter is by no means as clear as it ought to be. 9. apologising for this lengthy note, Yours sincerely, H.R*P.

Iviy dear Dickson, You will remember raising some time ago the question of the error in tne description in the Koweit Boundary Convention of 1922 of tne western oounaary of the Koweit Neutral zone as 'a low mountainous ridge called shaQ. (El Shaqq)'. We have since obtained the original Arabic text of the Convention and have had it examined by the Assistant Librarian here. He states that as it stands tne Arab worn used (da!) can only mean '‘a low mountainous range', and that this is an unlikely description is shown by the fact that the proper name given to it (El Shaqq) literally means '•gap” or 'trench'.

In actual fact what is described as ' a low mountair ridge^, can by no stretch of the imagination be considered a ridge or rise in the ground at all, seeing that it is a.widje o-htt Vi™, depression or vallez , varying in width from 1 mile te 6 miles, according to its position. 5, The depression in question, if the 1-1,000,000 Lhe&lt; Map, referred to In the Convention is examined, is obviously not a ridge or raise of hills, and I can only think that the mistake arose owing to the fact that Colonel More, D.S.O., the then Political Agent, Kuwait who was present at the Ojai Conference of December 1922 and signed the agreement on beha of the Shaikh of Kuwait on 2nd December (the Shaikh signed a ^Z - 2 - later date in Kuwait) was unfamiliar with the geography of the Neutral Zone and the 'Shaq' depression. 6. I personally have, on at least twenty occasions, travelled over the whole length of the 7t bhaq ’ valley, and am also entirely familiar with the Kuwait Neutral &lt;L.one, and that portion of Saudi/Arabia territory lying imriediately to the &gt;*est and vouth of same. I therefore speak with authority, when I say that the feature is a depression and not a ridge. 7. As understood by the Shaikh of Kuwait, and I be live by Bin 3aud also, the Western boundary of the Neutral ^one, follows an imaginary line drara down the centre of the Shaq depression, this inspite of anything said in the con vention. 8. It may further interest His Majesty's G-oveminent to know that Captain Papworth, H.E., in making his recent and very accurate survey of Kuwait and the Neutral one, placed the centre line of this Shaq depression at its lower end some 3 miles further to the $est than is indicated on the million sheet. 9. Inam submitting this report, I would aiggest that tbe geographical error referred to be corrected in all 1929 and 1933 copies of 'Aitohison's Collection of Treaties, Engagements and Sanads” without delay I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant .d.

Your -iXcellenoy will remember that, in view of ’Iraq’s impending application for admission to the league of Nations, we have recently been in correspondence on the subject of the more precise definition of the existing frontier between ’Iraq and Trans-Jordan. I have also consulted the Secretary of State regarding the need for similarly reaffirming the existing frontier between ’Iraq and Kuwait and 1 am now advised that it is desirable that this should be done# Having regard however to the special relatione of the Shaikh of Kuwait with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, it is not appropriate that the procedure adopted to define more precisely the existing frontier between ’Iraq and Trane-Jordan should be followed in the case of Kuwait. It is therefore suggested that Your excellency should, on behalf of the ’Iraqi Government, write me a letter proposing, in the terms of the drift which I enclose, a reaffirmation of the existing frontier between ’Iraq find Kuwait# X will then endeavour to obtain through the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Shaikh of Kuwait’s acceptance of Your Excellency’s proposals. A*as it may be necessary to produce this correspondence before some league Committee In September I would oak Your Excellency to gire urgent consideration to this matter and to let me have your reply as soon as possible. I should perhaps mention that the frontier line. described in the enclosed draft of the letter which I suggest Your Excellency should write to me is that which was laid down by Sir JPeroy Cox in correspondence with the Phaiich in April, 19E3, and which has subsequently been accepted as the de facto frontier between the two countries.

A further communication wis promised on the question of Iraq-Kuwait frontier in sixth paragraph of my telegram of 29th of April No. 109 regarding Iraq Trans-Jordan frontier. The Iraq-Kuwait frontier is laid io»n in correspondence terminating with the Memorandum Nd. 5405 of 19th April, 1923, addressed by Sir Percy Cox to Political Agent, Kuwait, and is as follows; ’’From the intersection of the Wadi-El-Audja with the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the Latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan Wells, Jabal Sanaa and Um Qasr, leaving them to Iraq and so on to the junction of the Khor Zobeir with the Khor Abdullah« The islands of War bah, Buhiyan, Maskan (or Mashjan), Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-El-Maradin appertain to Kuwait n 0 It is considered desirable that this frontier should be reaffirmed in a formal manner by instruments which are suitable for production if necessary at Ge;}eva when Iraq applies for admission to League of Nations. The procedure adopted in case of Trans-Jordan however is not regarded as appropriate in the case of Kuwait as direct correspondence between Iraq Government and Shaikh of Kuwait might create undesirable precedent for independent action on the part of the Shaikh in foreign affairs. Procedure which follows is theref)re recommended: (1) Letter to High Commissioner for Iraq fro a Iraq Government proposing a reaffirmatiQp of nxisilng-frontier between Iraq and Kuwait as quoted *71) quoted above* (2) letter to Resident,, Persian Gulf from HigR Commissioner, Iraq transmitting Iraq Govemnent ! s proposal. (3) Resident will then forward proposal to Shaikh through Political Agent at Kuwait with intimation that it has His Majesty T s Government’s approval* (4) Shaikh’s acceptance would similarly be sent to Iraq Government through Political Agent Resident Persian Gulf and High Commissioner^ Iraq. There would not seem to be any objection to the publication * xl* „ desired ot this correspondence/t.fter Iraq’s admission to the league; indeed publication would have the advantage of making clear the special relationship between His Majesty’s Government and Kuwait. It may, however, be necessary tc produce the correspondence before some League Committee ir September. I suggest that the Iraq Government be approached, if you see no objection to the procedure described above, in order that the necessary correspondence may be initiated at the earliest possible moment.

Addressed to Baghdad No Repeated to Bushire No. In paragraph 6 of my telegram of £3th of April No. 109 regarding Iraq Trans-Jordan frontier a further communication was promised on the question of Iraq-Kuwait frontier. This frontier is laid down in corres pondence ending with Sir Percy Cox’s Memorandum of 19th April, 19£3 No.5405 to Political gent, Kuwait and is as follows* 'From the intersection of the Wadi-Kl-Audja with the Batin thence northwards along the Batin to a oint just south of the latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Dafwan Wells, Jabal Sanam Dm Qasr, leaving them to Iraq and so on to the junction of the Khor Zobeir withwith the Khor Abdullah The islands of Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan (or Mashjan), Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, ^aru and Umm-31-iaradin appertain to Kuwait'. It is considered desirable for this frontier to be reaffirmed in a formal manner by instruments suitable for production if necessary at Genera when Iraq applies for admission to League. The procebure adopted in case of Trans-Jordan however is not regarded as appropriate for Kuwait since direct correspondence between Iraq Government and Shaikh of Kuwait might create undesirable precedent for independent action in foreign affairs on the part of the Shaikh. following procedure is therefore recommended: (1) Letter from Iraq Government to High Commissioner for Iraq proposingproposing a reaffirmation of existing frontier between Iraq and Kuwait as quoted above* (2) Letter from High Commissioner, Iraq to Resident, leraian Gulf forwarding proposal* (3) Resident will then send proposal to Shaikh through Political Agent at Kuwait with intimation that it has approval of His Majesty’s Government. ( 4 } Shaikh’s acceptance would similarly be transmitted to Iraq Government through Political Agent Resident Persian Gulf and High Coimaissioner, Iraq. There would appear to be no objection to the publication of this correspondence if necessary; indeed publication would have the advantage of making clear the special relationship(55^ relationship between His Majesty’s Gorernment and Kuwait.

Tlie Colonial Office are anxious, in view of tlie possibility of questions at Geneva in the autumn when Iraq is to enter the League, to regularize the Iraq- Koweit irontier. There is no question about the actual frontiers, but only about the procedure required* 2. The frontier was laid down in the Anglo- Turkish Agreement of 1913, which was never ratiiiea, and in 1923 the Sheikh was inionned that His Majesty^ Government recognised this same frontier* (P.1775 &amp; 2306/ 23). Last year in response to an outside enquiry, Mr. Eayner prepared a definition of the Koweit boundaries (P.5650/31) and it is this definition which the Colonial office are now using; we may therefore be ” - -—^ satisfied on this score. (Flagged in bound volume). u A (attached) :J5a 3000 5 31 3. An Exchange of Uotes between Iraq and Koweit seems a suitable way of regularizing the position, but the question arises whether the Sheikh of Koweit, whose territory is under British protection but not a protectorate, ought to correspond direct with Iraq. The Sheikh sometimes corresponds direct with Ibn Saud (e.g. P*Z* 241o/32) and sometimes His Majesty^ Government acts for him (e.g. P.Z.61l/32 # .which led to a hint ircm Euad Hamza that it was incorrect for His Majesty's Gar ernment % to make representations on behalf of Koweit, P.Z.1354). On the whole it would seem unobjectionable for the Sheikh to correspond direct with Iraq, since, as the Colonial Office say, the previous approval of His Majesty's Government will avoid the constitution of a dangerous precedent for independent action on his part. 4. The further point, however, suggests itself whether the letters between the Sheikh and the Political Agent Uxxder the procedure aiggested by the Colonial Office/Office in paragraph 5 ought not in any case to be published and not only M in cases oi necessity”* It might be argued that we ought to make it quite clear to the States concerned that we are responsible for the foreign relations of howeit and the incident vis-a-vis the Hejazis might be adduced in support of this argument* On the other hand, it has consistently been the policy of this office not to interest the .League of Nations in our position in the Gulf, and it may be thought unwise tj) 0++-4’ Ttr^+ fcc ^WvLLWJuJr draw attention to our relations with Koweit which are not 0 - ^ A based on a formal Treaty, but rest on our letter to the Sheiich of 1914 recognising his independence under British protection and our not very clearly defined undertaking L, in 1899^ to ”siq&gt;port him and accord him our good offices”. fc 0 r ^ J | ^ si* (that term being interpreted at the discretion of His Ufcu&gt; lioajesty 1 s Government)* Neither of these doouiiiCTtrj have been published and they will not appear in the new This being so, the publication at Geneva of the letters exchanged between the Sheikh and the Political Agent wouid in effect be the firspublic announcement oi our position in Koweit and the publicity attracted in this way would lie most undesirable. It would be far better to let t&amp;m. &lt;JC LuCsMt-ta' for the first time shyly in the narrative of Aitchison, and it is submitted that this argument outweighs the importance of making clear to the neighbouring States our real position in Koweit* The Hejazis and Iraqis are well aware oi this already and the former are unlikely •to take much notice oi events at Genevaj the Persians have not in recent years taken much interest in Koweit* In any case tne Colonial Office proposal visualizes, X unders tand,/ , GuMm.2f/ Draft Paper, POLITICAL P.Z. 2828/32.

The Koweit frontiers were laid down in the Anglo- Turkish Agreement of the 29th of July, 1913. This Agreement was never ratified, but in 1923 the Shaikh of Koweit was informed that His Majesty*s Government recognised the frontier claimed by him between Koweit and Iraq. This frontier is indicated by a green line THE UNDEB S! INDI.on the map which formed annex 5 to the Agreement of 1913, and is also shown in green on Map II annexed to the Historical Summary of Events for the period 1907-1928 (P.0.13), which was prepared in 1928 for the Persian Gulf ou'Q-Cornmittee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. JfoT convenience ol reference the definition of the frontier claimed hy the Shaikh and recognised by His Majesty 1 s Government is set out in a note attached to this letter. * In this connection, reference is invited to your letter No.P.2306 of the 20th of June, 1923, and the connected correspondence, and to your letter to the Foreisri Office No.P.2.5650/31 of the 26th of October, 1931. 3. It is important that when applying for membership of the League of Nations, the Iraq Government should be in a position to show that Iraq possesses well- defined frontiers with all bordering states. While it may be argued that this requirement is fulfilled in the case of Koweit, it is thought advisable that the frontier should now be defined in a formal manner by instruments which would be suitable for production if necessary at Geneva.4. After consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regarding the question of Iraq f s frontiers in general, Sir Philip Qunliffe- Lister considers that the best course would he for the existing frontier between Iraq and Koweit to be re affirmed in an Exchange of Notes between the Iraqi Grovemment and the Shaikh of Koweit v/hich in the case of Koweit should have the approval of His Majesty 1 s G-overnment. It is, of course, realised that the approval of His Majesty 1 s G-overnment in this case has no relevance in so far as the League of Nations is concerned, since Koweit does not come within the purview of that body. Nevertheless, Sir Samuel Hoare will doubtless agree that since the foreign relations of Koweit are under the control of His Majesty 1 s _ G-overnment it is important to avoid what might constitute a precedent for independent action on the part of the Shaikh in the foreign affairs of his country. 5. It is, therefore, suggested that the settlement should take the form of an Exchange of Notes as follows (a) a note from the Iraqi Prime Minister to the ShaikhShaikh of Koweit putting forward the proposal for a re affirmation of the existing frontier on behalf of the Iraq G-ove rnment; &lt; (b) a letter from the Shaikh to the Political igent at iCo\reit reporting the proposal and asking for the approval of His Majesty T s Government; (c) a letter from the Political Agent to the Shaikh in reply to (b) conveying the approval of His Majesty’s Government; &lt; (d) a note from the Shaikh to the Iraqi Prime Minister taking note of and accepting the proposal in (a). (Letters (b) and (c) would not be for publication except in cases of necessity). It is proposed to follow a similar procedure, mutatis mutandis , in the case of the Iraq-Trans-Jordan frontier. 6 . As it is very desirable that this question, together with the other outstanding questions affecting Iraq’s frontiers should be settled before the September session of the Assembly of the League of Nations, Sir Philip Gunliffe-Lister would be glad to be informed as early as possible whether Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in the procedure suggested in the preceding paragraphs. If so, steps will immediately be taken to convey the necessary hotnecessary instructions to the High Commissioner for Iraq and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It is not anticipated that any difficulty will be experienced in obtaining the Iraqi Government’s consent to the proposed arrangement. 7* Copies of this letter with the enclosure are being sent to the Foreign Office, War Office and the Air Ministry.

IN view of the question that has arisen as to the position of foreigners in Koweit, it may be of interest to give a brief account of the relations of His Majesty’s Govern ment with that territory. 2 . Although from about the middle of last century friendly intercourse had been maintained with the representative of the British Power in the Persian Gulf, nothing of consequence occurred until early in 1897, when Sheikh Mubarak, alarmed by the arrival of a Turkish sanitary official and other developments, requested an interview with the British Resident, and, representing that he was much concerned by recent incidents, strongly urged that Great Britain should undertake to prevent the absorption of Koweit by Turkey ; if this were done, he was prepared to assist, with all the force at his command, in maintaining law and order in his part of the Gulf. At that time no definite arrangement was made, though at the end of the year (1897) a threatened attack on Koweit by the sheikhs of El Katr was prevented by the de-patch of a British gunboat, and Sheikh Mubarak renewed his request for British protection. 3. Various forward moves w^ere made by the Turkish authorities, and, in view of the developments which took place, an agreement was concluded on the 23rd January, 1899, by His Majesty’s Government with the sheikh, binding him, his heirs and successors not to code, sell, lease, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any portion of his territory to foreigners without the previous a&gt;sent of the British Government, or to receive the agent of any foreign Power at Koweit. His Majesty’s Government, on their part, assured the sheikh of their good offices. The relations of the sheikh with the Ottoman Government remained in a more or less unsatisfactory condition until September 1901, when a temporary settlement was reached by the latter undertaking to His Majesty’s Government that they would not send troops to Koweit and that they would maintain the status quo there on condition that His Majesty’s Government would not occupy the place or establish a British protectorate; and the Marquess of Lansdowne gave an assurance to the Turkish Ambassador to that effect. 4. The sheikh’s promise of 1899 as to non-alienaticn of territory was confirmed in a secret agreement of the 15th October, 1907, respecting the lease of the Bunder Shiveikh lands; and these two agreements continued until July 1913 to form the basis of British relations with Koweit. 5. The British and Ottoman Governments, having felt for some years that it was desirable formally to regularise the situation at Koweit, arrived at the agreement contained in articles 1-10 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913,' :i: ' by the terms of which the territory of Koweit was recognised as an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman flag was to be flown by the sheikh, but he was to have the right to insert a distinctive emblem in the corner ; be was to continue to be a Turkish kaimakam ; and his successors were to be appointed to a similar position by the Ottoman Government. The boundaries of the sheikh’s immediate terr itory and bis wider tribal jurisdiction were delimited ; the Ottoman Government recognised the existing agreements between the sheikh and Hij^ Majesty’s Government, and His Majesty’s Government undertook, on their part, not to alter the nature of British relations with the Government of Koweit, or to establish a protectorate there, so long as the status quo as defined in the convention underwent no change. 6 . On the 8 th August, 1914, Sheikh Mubarak was informed officially by the officiating Resident in the Persian Gulf that a state of war existed between Great Britain and Germany, and on the 21 st August he made a declaration of loyalty to His Majesty’s Government on behalf of himself and his tribes, placed “his efforts, his men and his ships ” at Great Britain’s disposal and expressed a desire to eject the Turkish garrisons from the islands at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, which he claimed to be lawfully his. He repeated this declaration in a letter of the same date to the officiating * ft^f 1 S28 [81G0] * This convention was never ratified.2 Resident in the Persian Gulf, which was formally acknowledged by the latter on the 25th August, 1914. 7. In view of the increasing likelihood that Turkey would intervene in the war on Germany’s side, it became clear that His Majesty’s Government’s previous undertakings to the Sheikh of Koweit would have to be renewed, and contingently extended, against the event of a state of war arising between Great Britain and Turkey. Accordingly a letter containing the following assurances was despatched to the sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914, by the acting Resident in the Gulf: — “ In return for the valuable co-operation which we expect from you, I am authorised by the Government, in the event of success—and, insha Allah, we shall succeed—to assure you again that Basra will never again be subject to Turkish authority. “ I am further to give your Excellency personally the following special assurances :— “( 1 .) The date gardens which you now possess between Fao and Gurnak shall remain in the full possession of you and your heirs and for ever be immune from taxation. “( 2 .) You are guaranteed by the great British Government against all consequences of your attack against Safwan, Umm Kasr and Bubiyan. “ (3.) Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” 8 . On the 28th February, 1917, upon the death of Sheikh Mubarak-bin-Subah, these undertakings were renewed in the “ Khar ta ” to his smi, and after the latter had also died and had been succeeded by his brother, Sheikh Salim-bin-Mubarak, the Government of India forwarded to Sir P. Cox, for presentation to the new ruler, a Kharita” from the Viceroy renewing to him likewise the undertakings given to his father. 9. Sheikh Salim, during the first half of 191 8 , made considerable difficulties for His Majesty’s Government over the question of the control of the blockade in Koweit territories and ports, and in that connection the following message was conveyed to him through the Resident at Koweit on the 5th July, 1918 :— “ Government have deeply regretted the events of the last two years at Koweit, but they welcome your declarariun* as affording an opportunity for re-establishment of our traditional friendship. In order that there may be no misunderstanding in the future, they desire to explain their policy towards your Excellency. On the one hand, should you show to Government same friendship and assistance which they have experienced for many years in their dealings with the rulers of Koweit, they will continue to you the assurances given to your illustrious father, the late Sheikh Mubarak, especially that ‘ the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,’t and will extend to you the friendship and protection and assistance which they gave to him ; and, finally, they hope that you will raise the name of your house and of Koweit to the .high position which it held in the past in eyes of British Government and of peoples of Arabia. “ On the other hand, it is the plain duty of ruler of a State which is on terms of friendship with Government to prevent all acts, either by his own subjects or by other persons in his territory, which may be contrary to interests of Government; and since they know that, if you wish to do so, you have the power to control your subjects and others in your territory, Government will be compelled to hold your Excellency personally responsible should any such act unfortunately be committed in future. They hope your Excellency will fully realise your responsibility as the ruler of Koweit towards Government under whose protection and friendship Koweit has so greatly prospered in the past, and will understand that prosperity depends entirely on preservation of true friendship, both in word and deed, with Government.” 10 . I he Political Resident in the Persian Gulf having apparently suggested, in November 1918, the declaration of British protectorates over Bahrein, Koweit, &amp;c., the * * Aocejiti' g the measures of control desired by the British authorities. | from article y of secret agreement of the 15th October, iyo7, referred to in paragraph 4,3 ■ v A iceroy considered that such declaration would ( 1 ) excite the suspicions of the neighbouring peoples, who would regard it as a prelude to annexation, and ( 2 ) provoke jealousy of other Powers, and involve us in heavy obligations, both military and financial. The Viceroy suggested that the better policy would be at an inter-Allied conference to put our cards frankly on the table, explaining our special interests and prescriptive position in the Persian Gulf, and the measures into which we have been driven by the special protection of those interests, and to express the hope that those interests and position might be fully recognised without need for further definition. -y- 11 . In December 1919 the Civil Commissioner at Bagdadfraised again the question / of the making of a jurisdictional Order in Council for Koweit (which question, as will be seen on reference to my memorandum' in E 7915/6681/91/1921, was considered in 1911 and then left over until a settlement should have been arrived at with Turkey in regard to the Arab littoral), but the India Officej'considered that although the order was ^ /o 4 desirable in itself, and there would be an advantage in issuing it at an early date, that * moment, when the question of the machinery for the administration of the mandate for Mesopotamia was unsettled, and the effect of the mandate upon the relations of His Majesty’s Government with contiguous countries was still uncertain, did not appear &gt; 31 */ opportune for its issue, a view that was endorsed by this Office.l J: 12 . On the 9th July, 1921, the Colonial Office, who had become responsible for policy on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, communicated an enquiry from the High Commissioner, Bagdad, as to the status of Koweit as a result of the war, and asking whether it could not be placed on a similar basis to that of Bahrein, and whether an Order in Council could not be issued now that Turkey had lost suzerainty over fTo* fatty-/ it. | Ihe Colonial Office were told in reply that, from the legal point of view and on the supposition that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, the status of that territory would seem to be governed by article 132 of f-fo £ ~Ob the Treaty of Peace.ff In practice, provided some prior agreement were reached with Ztr/y/^4 the Sultan of Koweit, it would appear unlikely that any foreign Power would challenge p ^ *■ the issue of an Order in Council on the lines of “ The Bahrein Order in Council, 1913,” ' although the extension of British jurisdiction, as in that order, to foreigners might involve the prior concurrence of some foreign Powers. It was further suggested to the Colonial Office that the High Commissioner, Bagdad, might be instructed to open negotiations with the Sultan with a view to ascertaining the measure of British super vision which the latter was prepared to accept, but that the actual issue of any Order in Council consolidating any agreement that might be reached with the Sultan should be postponed until the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey.

Mr. W ard]aw-Milne, — To ask the Secretary of State f or the Colonies, whether tliere is ' any treaty between the British Government and the Sultan of Koweit; and whether any subsidies are paid to that ruler. Mr. WARDLAW-MILNE asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether there is any treaty between the British Government and the Sultan of Koweit; and whether any subsidies are paid to that ruler ? Sir A. CHAMBERLAIN: The Sheikh of Koweit is in treaty relations with His Majesty r s Government, and is recog nised as an independent ruler under British protection. The answer to the second part of the question is in the negative. MINUTE OR SUCGECTED HI1PI/K.assurances were renewed to the present Sheikh on his accession: we have held in the past that ’support and good offices' are conditional on good behaviour. 3. It is probable that hr. 'Yardlaw line’s question is inspired by the recent ^Ikhwan raids inside Toweit territory in She course of one of which an jnerican missionary was killed, and to repel which the I.A.F., etc., were brought in. It may be well therefore to explain briefly in the reply the extent of our commitments without entering too deeply into the Quid P£o quo - exclusion of foreign representatives, etc. It is perhaps unnecessary to refer to the Igreements with the Sheikh in (c) (d) and (f) / of the Precis. 4.

Meade’s accompanying e ^' ) r ’’/y similarly communicated; but the Turkish Government was told m oir E. Grey s covering note that “His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion The attitude adopted at the time by His Majesty’s Government towards this undertaking is illustrated by the following extract from India Office letter dated the oOth October 1911 to the Foreign Office:—“The term ‘ good offices ’ . . . is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by Bis Majesty’s Government in 1901-2, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression will moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises.” (c) Agreement of the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 24th May 1900, to prohibit the importation of arms into, and their exportation from, Koweit. (d) Postal Agreement, dated 28th February 1904, giving His Majesty’s Government the sole right to erect a post office at Koweit. (c) Secret Agreement, dated 15th October 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore. -In the fifth article of the two documents constituting the agreement the Sheikh reaffirmed his pledge not to cede, sell, Ac., any Koweit territory to any foreign Government or foreign subject without His Majesty s Government’s permission. In the ninth, the British Government promised that “the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to . . . the Sheikh of Koweit and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mubarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs Ac., and Iris arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mubarak-as-Subah, ruler of Kow r eit, and bis heirs after him . . .’ . ^°te. The lease, or rather the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site, was terminated in 1922. Jt does not appear, however, that the agreement was abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges, so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments, presumably remain binding. 3138 75 10.28 P. 4525/11. &amp; rA* JieuuiH * P. 1446/11- ^** v * - '* w **'*'CvC^f 'St A■MHB naam 0ww&lt;\u^ l(j* .

He gave a similar undertaking as regards oil in 1913. (g) Letter dated 3rd November 1914 from the Political Resident to the Sheikh, in which the Sheikh was given, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, certain assurances of which the third was that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” (h) The undertakings given to Sheikh Mubarak were renewed in 1917 to his son Jabir, and again, on his accession, to the latter’s successor, his brother Salim. To Salim, who proved troublesome, Government in 1918 gave a warning that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour. (See Memorandum on Koweit on page 0, para. 20.) (i) In a Kharita delivered on 19th July 1921 the Viceroy renewed to the present Sheikh, Ahmad al Jabir, nephew of Salim, the assurances given to the latter. BAHREIN. Aitchison, Voi. xn, (a) In 1820 the Ruler of Bahrein subscribed to the general treaty with p ‘ 172 ‘ the Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf, which prescribed abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea, from slave traffic, and from inter-tribal war, and peace with the British Government. (The adherence of Bahrein to this treaty gave the British Government a formal right to intervene, as it did in 1863, between Bahrein, Abu Dhabi and Katr, and again in 1867-9.) (b) In 1817 the Sheikh of Bahrein subscribed to an engagement for the Do., p. 178 . abolition of slave trade in his ports and for the submission of Bahreini Do., P . iss. vessels to search by British cruisers for slaves, and to seizure if guilty, and in 1856 signed a further engagement for the better suppression of the slave trade. Do., p. 159 . (c) On the 31st May 1361 Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa signed on behalf of himself and his heirs and successors a “ perpetual treaty of peace and friendship with the British Government.” In Article 2 he agreed to abstain from maritime aggression, war, piracy and slavery by sea “ so long as I receive the support of the British Govern ment in the maintenance of the security of my own possessions against similar aggressions directed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of this Gulf.” In Article 3 he undertook to refer to the arbitration of the Political Resident cases of aggression by sea on Bahrein or Bahreinis and to refrain from retaliation without the Political Resident’s assent. “And the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury ... by sea upon Bahrein or . . . its dependencies.” Do., p. 162 . (d) On 22nd December 1880 Sheikh Isa signed an agreement binding himself and his successors not to enter into negotiations with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the British Government, and to prevent the establishment of diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots, other than British, without the consent of the British Government. “This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of minor importance.” Do., p iss. t c ) Cn the 13th March 1892 Sheikh Isa signed a further agreement the first two articles of which reaffirmed his undertaking to abstain from relations with foreign Governments; in the third article he undertook “ on no account to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory save to the British Government.” p - 711 / 98 - (/) In 1898 the Sheikh of Bahrein signed an agreement to prohibit the traffic in arms in Bahrein territory. ..3 (g) In 1911 the Sheikh agreed not to allow any foreign Power to open a Post Office in Bahrein, and not to grant a pearl fishing or sponge fishing ^ concession to foreigners. In 1914 he agreed not to search for oil himself or give others permission to do so without consulting the Political Agent and receiving the approval of the Government of India. ‘ EL-KATR. (a) In 1868. as a result of hostilities initiated in Katr by the Sheikh of Bahrein in co-operation with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and continued by a retaliatory attack on Bahrein by Katr, Sheikh Mahomed bin Thani executed an agreement to abstain from hostilities and to accept the arbitration of the Resident, particularly hi disputes as to the tribute payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein, to whom the Sheikhs of Katr were then in some degree subordinated. (b) Shortly after, the Turks established themselves in Katr; and though the British authorities did not hesitate to have direct dealings with the Sheikhs of Katr, no written agreement was made with them. (c) In the course of the negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1913 it was agreed that the southern and eastern limit of “ le Sandjuk Ottoman de Nedjd” should be a “ une ligne partant du fond extreme du golfe faisant face it Pile de Zahnounie (i.e. the Ba.y of Salwa to the west of El Katr) qui ira directement an sud jusqu’au Ruba’-al-Khafi et separera le Nedjd de la presqu’-ile de PEl-Katr.'’ Further, it was agreed that “ le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britaunique—ne permettra pas au cheikh de Bahrein de s’immiscer dans les affaires interieures d’el-Katr, de porter atteinte a Pautonomie de ce pays on de Pannexer.” (d) The separation of El Katr from Nejd and its independence of Bahrein having been thus established (though not thereby given effect), the way was open for the conclusion of a Treaty signed on 3rd November 1916 after the Turks had finally been expelled from El-Katr in the course of the war. In this treaty the Sheikh takes note of, undertakes the obligations Articles I and n. resulting from, and is promised the advantages accruing from the various ■engagements concluded by the Trucial Chiefs for the suppression of slave trade and piracy and the preservation of the maritime peace. In Article III he undertakes to prohibit arms trade in Katr and to observe the arms traffic rules of the British Government. In Articles IV and V he undertakes to have no relations with the Agent of any other Power without the consent of the British Government, or to -cede land by lease, sale or gift or to grant monopolies, concessions or cable landing rights. In Articles VII, VIII and IX he undertakes to protect British residents and, if required, receive a British representative, and establish a British post and telegraph office. In return the British Government undertakes in Articles X and XI to protect the Sheikh, his subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, and to grant their good offices should he or his subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar ; it being understood that this obligation only applies in the event of such aggression by land or by sea being unprovoked by the Sheikh or his subjects. Note. —From para. 10 of the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on p. || it will be seen that on the question being raised by the Sheikh in 1922 of the assistance which he might expect from Government in the event of an attack by Ibn Sand, he was informed that His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance. TRUCIAL COAST (Ras-ul-Khaima, Abu Dhabi, Dabai, Shargah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain). (a) In 1820 these chiefs signed the general treaty (see Bahrein (a)) prescribing perpetual abstention from plunder and piracy b 3 T land and sea. and from irregular (i.e. unproclaimed) war; registration of dhows; peace with the British Government; abstention from the carrying off or transport of slaves; free entry of their ships into British ports; “and if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it.” :i: ' * “ Them ” in the context appears to mean the ships of the signatory Chiefs ; bnt it may mean the Chiefs.4 (b) In 1828, 1839 and 1847 agreements were entered into by these Chiefs- for the suppression ol‘ slave trade, and for the search and, if necessary, seizure by British warships of any of their vessels suspected of engaging in this trade. (o) In 1843 a Maritime 'Truce for ten years was signed by these Chiefs “ being fully impressed with a sense of the evil consequences arising from /C' our subjects and dependents being prevented from carrying on the pearl fishery without interruption on the banks, owing to the various feuds existing among ourselves.” This Truce cancelled the right of the .Chiefs, implied in the general 'Treaty of 1820, to wage regular war on each other. Under the Truce they agreed to refer disputes and cases of aggression to the decision of the Political Resident. In 1853 the Truce was renewed in perpetuity. (d) In 1892 exclusive agreements were signed by all the Trucial Chiefs, on behalf of themselves, their heirs and successors, that they will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; that without the consent of the British Government they will not consent to the residence in their territories of the agent of any other Government; and that they will on no account cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, any part of their territories, save to the British Government. (e) In 1902 the Chiefs undertook to prohibit the importation of arms into, and their exportation from their territories. (/) In 1911 the Sheikhs undertook not to give pearling or sponge fishing concessions, save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government. (g) In 1922 similar undertakings were given regarding oil. Aitchison, Vol. XII, p. 207. Do., pp. 220, 221. Do., p. 226. Do., p. 227. Do., p. 229. Do., p. 230. Do., p. 232. OMAN (MUSCAT). (i) Treaties and Agreements with Great Britain. (a) Treaty relations date from 1798, when an agreement was made bv the Imam with the East India Company to exclude the French and Dutch from his territories “whilst warfare shall continue between the English Companv and them.” (5) In 1822 a Treaty for Suppression of the Slave Trade was signed, providing inter alia for action by the Imam’s officers in Muscat territorvg and for seizure, outside certain limits, by the British of any vessels carrying 'slaves to Christian countries. (c) In 1839 a Commercial Treaty was concluded on a reciprocal most favoured-nation basis, providing for the purchase, sale or hire of lands by British subjects in Muscat territory, appointment of Consuls, protection of Muscat subjects in British employ, extraterritoriality for British subjects unrestricted trade, limitation of import duties to 5 per cent, and freedom from export duties. (d) In 1839 and 1845 further enactments reinforced the right of British vessels to detain and search and if necessary confiscate Muscat ships suspected of carrying slaves, outside certain limits. P (e) In 1862 an Anglo-French Declaration was signed under which the French Government and Her Majesty’s Government engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. ' ‘ (/) In 1864 the Sultan agreed to permit the construction of, and to protect one or more telegraph lines in his own territories or in those leased by him from Persia. But no sovereign right was to be conferred on the British Government over any such territory. This was followed in 1865 by a similar convention in respect of His Highness’ territories in Arabia and Mekran (g) In 1873 a further Treaty for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was concluded.. This extended the powers of seizure possessed by British vessels to include seizure of Muscat vessels trading between Muscat ports* the Sultan undertook to shut all slave markets in his dominions and to protect liberated slaves. u (fi) In 1891 a new Treaty of Commerce, Friendship and Navigation wa&lt;= concluded, which cancelled the Treaty of 1839, but was framed on simihn lines. Coals, provisions, &amp;e., for Her Majesty’s ships were to be exemot from duty (Art 6) No export duties were to be levied without the consent of Her Majesty s Government. This treaty, like that of 1839 provided n capitulatory regime for British subjects. ^ 30 (i) In 1891 an agreement was also signed by the Sultan, pledging him Aitchieon, Voi. xn, never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give in occupation any of his p - 24 °- dominions or dependencies, save to the British Government. (j) 189;) a guarantee was given to the Sultan that, whatever the differences between the Sheikhs of Oman and the Sultan, Government would not allow the former to attack the two towns of Muscat and Mattrah. The Sultan issued a notification m these terms, i he warning was renewed in 1913. ^ p. 2749 / 13 . (/i) In 1898 a proclamation was issued giving British and Persian vessels Aitchison, Voi. xn, the right to search British, Persian or Muscat vessels in Muscat waters, and 1&gt; - 241 ' Muscat vessels in British or Persian waters, for arms and ammunition. (l) In 1902 the Sultan undertook to grant His Majesty's Government the Do., p. 242 . first option on mining rights in the Sur coalfields. (m) In 1903 the Sultan issued a notification authorising the searching by Mem0 - i5 &gt; p- 172 - British and Italian ships, both on the high seas and in Muscat waters, of Muscat vessels suspected of carrying arms to certain prohibited African areas. 00 In 1923 the Sultan undertook not to give any oil concession without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. (ii) Treaties with other Powers. (а) In 1833 the Sultan concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with no., p. clx. the United States of America providing for perpetual peace, unrestricted trading (except that muskets and ammunition might not be sold to private persons in Zanzibar), limitation of import duties to 5 per cent., reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to trading charges, and appointment of consuls. (б) In 1844 a Treaty of Commerce was concluded with France in terms almost identical with the British Treaty of 1839. (c) In 1877 a short I reaty with Holland provided reciprocal most-favoured- uo., p. clxxx. nation treatment for the nationals of each country, both generally and in respect of import duty and the regulations regarding export and transit. SUMMARY. 1. I he following are common to the engagements of all the above Arab States to the British Government:— The undertaking not to cede, sell, mortgage, &amp;c., any of their territory except to the British Government, or to give* any oil concession without permission. 1 he undertaking to prohibit the traffic of arms in their territories, and (except in the case of Koweit) the undertaking to suppress slave trade. 2. The following is common to all, except Muscat The undertaking to have no negotiations with, or receive the repre sentative of, any Bower other than the British Government, except with the consent of the British Government, and the undertaking not to give any pearling or sponge fishing concession without permission. 3. Ihe following is common to all except Koweit, and it is implied in the case of Koweit: — The undertaking to maintain peace in perpetuity with the British Government. 4. To all, except Muscat, the British Government promises protection from aggression by sea, either explicitly or, as to the Trucial Chiefs, by implication. 5. To El-Katr the British Government promises also “ good offices ” in the case of aggression by land. 6. Bo Koweit the British Government undertakes unqualified “ protection.” Communication of Treaties. 1. To the Turkish Government in 1911. All the treaties prior to 1911 regarding Koweit, El Katr, and the Trucial Chiefs mentioned in this Memorandum, with the addition of one or two 3138 Bminor agreements not mentioned, but without the Bunder Shweikh Secret Agreement (Koweit (d)), were communicated to the Porte in connection with the general negotiations for the Anglo-Turkish Agreement. (See also Note on Koweit (6)). 2. To Ibn Saud in 1927. Article 6 of the Treaty of Jeddah (1927) runs as follows: — “ His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Koweit and Bahrein, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.” Jeddah Desp. 133 , The Foreign Office have accordingly communicated to Ibn Saud copies of Dec. 4 1927,P.73/28. ^ treat j es gj ven to Turkey ill 191K together with the El Katr treaty of 1910, and a complete set of the Muscat treaties with Mis Majesty’s Government as published in Aitchison. He has also been informed of the “good offices” accorded to Koweit, and of the provisions of Article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement. 3. To the Persian Government. f.o. tei. 186 , Sept. 4 In September 1928 His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Teheran, was 1928 - instructed to communicate to the Persian Government the text of the exclusive agreements of 1892 with the Trucial Chiefs.

Viceroy’s tel. 1175 S., 1. Sheikh Ahmad-al Jabir, C.I.E. (January 1922&gt;, born 1885, has ruled Koweit since March 1921, when his succession to his uncle, Sheikh Salim (born 1864, succeeded 1917, died 23rd February 1921), who had ruled since the death of Sheikh Jabir Ibn Mabarak in 1917, was recognised by His Majesty’s Government, subject, it would appear, to agreement to impose and enforce through his territory such further restrictions on the arms c.o. to h.c., Iraq. April 2 traffic as might be considered desirable. On the invitation of His Majesty’s 1921 &gt; p - 175 ^/ 21 - Government, the Sheikh visited the United Kingdom in October 1919, as the representative of his uncle, with the son of Ibn Sand, and was received by the King. His Excellency is entitled to a permanent salute of seven guns, the number having been reduced from 12 (personal) on his accession. 2. The principality is an independent Arab State, under British protection, but not a British protectorate. 0 Its ruler is precluded by his engagements, of which an abstract is printed in the Precis of Treaties 0ct - 81920 ’ p - 7455 - appended to this Memorandum, from receiving foreign representatives, and from ceding, leasing, mortgaging, or giving for occupation, or any other purpose, any portion of its territory to any foreigner or foreign Power without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government; he is bound to suppress slave traffic and to prohibit traffic in arms within his territories ; and he has agreed not to give a concession for oil, or for pearl fishing, without the approval of Ilis Majesty’s Government. 3. The internal administration is conducted by the Sheikh, assisted in theory by an elected Council of Advisers (two from the Subah or reigning tTei. from h.c inu, to family, four from the inhabitants, elected for one year), acceptance of c.o., March 4 1921 , which was made for the first time a condition of recognition by the people Ja. 1376 / 21 ' of Koweit on the accession of the present Sheikh.f The Council, though 1927 /p! 2 (p e 2417 /^ 8 ); duly elected, has, however, never met.if 4. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are represented by the Political Agent (at present Major J. C. More, D.S.O.), an appointment created in 1904, maintained since that date save for a brief Lor. ii, 1039 - 40 . interval in 1905, and borne on the cadre of the Indian Political Department. The Political Agent is directly subordinate to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He does not hold His Majesty’s Commission as a Consul or exercise Consular functions. Under the Koweit Order in Council of 1925 (see paras. 24-27 below), he is the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises his powers subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the limits of his jurisdiction are the territories and territorial waters of Koweit, and he exercises jurisdiction inter alios over British subjects and protected persons, and over the subjects and protected persons (not being subjects or protected persons of Muslim Governments) of Foreign States in respect of whom the Foreign States concerned may agree to the exercise of such jurisdiction. 5. The effect of the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee of 1921 was to leave control of the internal administration and affairs of Koweit to the Government of India (to whom, and not to His Majesty’s Government, the Political Resident in the Gulf was instructed in 1924 to c/. p. 1886/24 and 540 A/ 23 . look for orders regarding them), subject to the general control of His Majesty’s Government, and to the prior concurrence of the Colonial Office in matters of political significance. Questions of policy, especially questions M .s. Committee Report affecting relations with Ibn Sand, fell to be dealt with by the Colonial Office. P ara - 12 - The question of the channels through which the instructions of His Majesty’s Government are to issue on matters affecting the Principality is dealt with in para. 5 of the Note on Political Control in the Persian Gulf on page 6. Expenditure on Koweit is divided between Ilis Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. In the latest year for which figures are p. 3108 / 28 . available (1926-7) it amounted to Rs. 45,683, plus payments in respect of pension contribution amounting to Rs. 9,423, a total of Rs. 55,106. 2979c 75 10.28Secret Uesp. from India, IRS.

The history of Koiveit up to 1907 is given in the foreign Oihce Memorandum of 1908. At the time when that memorandum was composed and until the beginning of the War, Koweit was of vital interest to ( rrea^r*^ Britain in connection with the Baghdad Railway, and during the periou 1908-14 His Majesty’s Government, in their relations with the bheikh, had primarily in view the consolidation of their position and influence in Koweit in the face of the efforts of Germany to establish herself at the head of the Gulf. 8. The vexed question of the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit over the islands of Bubiyan and Warba, dealt with in the foreign Office Memorandum, was carefully investigated by the local authorities and the Government of India in 1907-9. The conclusions which emerged were that enquiry had gone far to establish the claims of the Sheikh to the ownership of Bubiyan, but that no satisfactory evidence had been produced as to his claims to Warba ; and in the circumstances His Majesty’s Government decided that it was inadvisable to raise any question of the rights of the Sheikh to either island. (Both islands were recognised as falling within the dominions of the Sheikh of Koweit by the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of -9th July 1913.) 9. Between 1909 and 1911 the attitude of the Turkish authorities in the Basra Vilayet, who placed difficulties in the way of the registration of property acquired in their jurisdiction by the Sheikh unless His Kxcellency would consent to describe himself as a Turkish subject—an attitude which inevitably raised the wider question of the status ol Koweit, gave rise to considerable correspondence, in the course of which His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to make clear the views on that matter of His Majesty’s Government, Circumstances, however, intervened to make an immediate demarche by Sir G. Lowther from time to time unnecessary or undesirable, and the question merged in the general Anglo-Turkish negotiations initiated in 1911. 10. The Sheikh undertook in 1911 not to grant a pearl fishing concession to foreigners save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government, and gave a similar undertaking as regards oil in 1913. Subsequent developments as regards oil concessions are dealt with in para. ^9 below. With the assistance of a loan of £1^,500 from the Government of India, arrangements were made in 1914 for the installation by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, on behalf of the Sheikh, of a water distilling plant, which was not, however, brought into operation until 1919.' :;: ' 11. The question of Koweit played an important part in the Anglo- Turkish negotiations of 1911-14. An agreement was reached, and a Convention, to give elfect to it, signed on 29th July 4913. Under this agreement, in the terms of which the concurrence of the Sheikh had been secured, the territory of Koweit was recognised as an autonomous caza of the Ottoman Empire; the Ottoman flag was to be flown by the Sheikh, but he was to have the right to insert a distinctive emblem in the comer; he was to continue to be a Turkish Kaimakam, and his successors were to be appointed to a similar position by the Ottoman Government; the full administrative autonomy of the Sheikh was recognised within the territories of Koweit proper, the limits of which were defined by the red circle on Map No. II appended to this Memorandum ; within a surrounding area (included within a green line on the map) which was occupied by tribes recognised as dependent on him, he was, as in the past, to continue to levy tribute and to perform the administrative duties of Turkish Kaimakam; in both regions Turkey undertook to abstain entirely from any interference, though the right to appoint a Commissioner at Koweit “to protect the interests and subjects of other parts of the Empire ” was secured toiler; existing agreements between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government, including the Secret Agreement of 1899, were recognised by the Ottoman Government, and His Majesty’s Government engaged that so long as no change was made in the status quo as now defined, they would not alter theX 9 O nature of British relations with the Government of Koweit or establish a Protectorate there. A subsidiary article (9) secured to the Sheikh the enjoyment of his private property in the Basra Vilayet. 12. The outbreak of war in August 1914 prevented the final ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement the substance of which is summarised ' above, and the entry of Turkey into the War in November 1914 against the Allies produced a completely new situation. The Sheikh, who had been informed officially on 8th August 1914 of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany, on 21st August made a declaration of loyalty to His Majesty’s Government on behalf of himself and his tribes,* placed “his efforts, his men, and his ships ” at the disposal of Great Britain, and expressed a desire to eject the Turkish garrison from the islands at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, which he claimed to be lawfully his. In return for his co-operation against the Turks the Sheikh, in a letter from the Political Resident in the Gulf, dated 3rd November 1914,| was given the following assurances, of which the third is the most important:— (1) The date gardens which you now possess between Fao and Gurnah shall remain in the full possession of you and your heirs and be immune from taxation. (2) You are guaranteed by the Great British Government against all consequences of your attack against Safwan, Umm Kasr and Bubiyan. (3) Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. 13. In February 1915 sanction was given to the transfer to Koweit of the Admiralty coaling depot at BushireJ a step originally recommended by the Government of India in 1910, and approved in 1912 by the Foreign Office, Admiralty and India Office, the taking of which had however hitherto been postponed in view of the possibility that it might prejudicially react on the Anglo-Turkisli negotiations. But on the recommendations of the Naval authorities it was agreed in 1916 that the proposal should be dropped until the conclusion of the War. It was decided in 1920 that the transfer should not take place. 14. It had been agreed in 1913 that an Indian Post Office should be established at Koweit on the ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention ; and an office w r as in fact opened under the orders of the Government of India at the beginning of 1915. 15. Sheikh Mubarak (K.O.I.E. 1911, K.C.S.I. 1914\ who had ruled Koweit since his assassination of his brother in 1896, and who had consistently co-operated actively with His Majesty’s Government, died on 28th November 1915, and wans succeeded by his eldest son, Sheikh Jabir, wffio w r as informed in March 1916 by the Viceroy that “ so long as you act up to existing arrangements with the British Government you may expect the same support as Avas enjoyed by your father.” 16. In the earlier part of 1915 Koweit had been brought in intimate contact with the affairs of Ibn Sand on the revolt of the Ajman tribe against the latter. The Ajman were finally routed in September, and forced to take refuge in Kow r eit territory, in which they remained until the death of Mubarak, immediately on which Ibn Sand pressed his successor, Sheikh Jabir, to expel the Ajman Sheikhs, a demand to which Jabir, reluctant to eject the Ajman lest they should be driven into the enemy camp, but unable to hold out against Ibn Sand’s pressure without creating an open breach, finally yielded in February 1916. 17. Relations between Ibn Sand and Koweit had for some years before the death of Mubarak been growing cooler. Ibn Sand had latterly resented what he regarded as the equivocal attitude of the Sheikh during the negotiations between the Ottoman Government and himself in the spring of 1914; the asylum given to the Ajman was a further grievance,§ and the incidence of the transit dues levied from time immemorial in Koweit, formed the subject of a complaint by the ruler of Nejd in 1916.

Darbar held at Koweit on 20th November 1910, and attended by Ibn Sand, the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Sheikh Jabir of Koweit and Sir Percy Cox, for the purpose of investing the Sheikh of Koweit with the C.S.I., the three chiefs swore together to work with His Majesty’s Government for the achievement of a common end.^j IS. On the death on 5th February 1917, of Sheikh Jabir “in whose/-\. weak hands ’’ to quote the Political Agent, 0 Government in Koweit “ had almost collapsed,” His Majesty’s Government approved the recognition as successor of his brother Sheikh Salim, to whom an assurance similar to that granted to his predecessor and quoted above was conveyed by the Viceroy in March 1917. The new Sheikh was a man of very different calibre from Sheikh Jabir. Narrow in outlook, bigoted in religious matters, tactless in his personal relations, his marked individuality and strength of purpose none the less made it possible for the Political Agent to report in the spring of 1918 that he had “ established himself in a brief space of time very securely in the Sheikhdom.” But the qualities which helped him to assert himself locally shortly set him at odds with both His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. 19. Difficulty arose with the latter over the Ajman tribe, whom Salim allowed in October 1917 to return to Koweit, and over the respective rights of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh to levy tribute on the Awazim tribe, and formed the subject of vigorous complaint by Ibn Saud at the end of 1917. In July 1918, Mr. Philby represented that Ajman activities based on Koweit territory were causing widespread resentment in Nejd and leading to remonstrance from Ibn Saud as to the inadequacy of our support. Measures to meet this grievance—the location of a mobile column in Koweit territory, the stationing of a British post at Safwan Wells, the occupation of Koweit itself—were under exami nation when, in September 1918, Lord Allenby’s victories in Palestine made the removal of the blockade possible and temporarily eased the situation, and no action was taken beyond warning the leading Sheiks that if raids continued their subsidies would cease. 20. Difficulty with His Majesty’s Government arose over the strict main tenance in Koweit territories and ports of the blockade imposed in (?) 1915|| with a view to preventing the leakage of supplies to the enemy, whether in Mesopotamia or in the isolated Turkish garrisons at Medina and elsewhere in the Arabian peninsula —a blockade, not unnaturally unpopular with Koweit merchants, the strictness of which was relaxed by Salim. The Sheikh subsequently adopted an attitude so obstructive in the matter that, after prolonged consideration, it was found necessary to warn him through the Political Resident, on 5th July 1918, that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts “contrary to the interests of (His Majesty’s) Government” “ unfortunately be committed in future,” he would be held personally responsible.! The hint was not wasted ; the Sheikh for the remainder of the war maintained a less unsatisfactory attitude towards His Majesty’s Government,! and his co-operation in the matter of the blockade was recognised at the end of 1918 by the grant of the O.S.L and of a lump sum of 3 lakhs of rupees, and by the cancellation of the claim of the Government of India in respect of the loan of £12,500 made in connection with the Koweit water supply in 1914§ (see para. 10 above). 21. On the conclusion of the war His Excellency despatched his nephew, the present Sheikh, to offer his congratulations to the King on its successful outcome, and there has been no friction of importance since then with His Majesty’s Government. (2).—1919-28. 22. The termination of the war necessitated a decision as to the status of Koweit, which His Majesty s Government had promised m November 1914 to recognise as an independent principality under British protection. The declaration of a British protectorate over the State, as over Bahrein* &amp;c., which was mooted by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, met with no support from the Government of India, who took exception to it II tt has not been possible to ascertain the precise date.I 5 as likely to rouse suspicion in the neighbouring Arab peoples, to provoke the jealousy of other Powers, and to involve His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in heavy obligations, both military and financial. Their view was accepted by the Secretary of State for India; the proposal was dropped and matters continued to rest on the declaration y^yof 1914 quoted in para. 12 above. On the general question of status being specifically raised in connection with the preparation of a Koweit Order in Council, the Foreign Office in July 1921 expressed the view that, from the legal standpoint and on the understanding that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, “the status of this territory would appear to be governed by Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres.” It was subsequently agreed that a final decision on the question of status must await the signature of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, and, the Treaty of Lausanne having been signed in the autumn of 1923, steps were taken to introduce an Order in Council providing for British jurisdiction within the territory of the Sheikh. r lhat territory, as stated in para. 2 above, may now be regarded as an independent Arab State under British protection, but not a British protectorate. Letter from F.O. to I.O.. July 25 1921, P. 3495. 23. The questions of most importance which have arisen in Koweit since the conclusion of the War are the following:— A. Internal:— (1) Koweit Order in Council providing for British jurisdiction within the Principality. (2) Termination of the lease of Bunder Shweikh. B. External:— (1) Relations with Ibn Sand — (а) Koweit-Nejd-Iraq boundary question ; (б) Koweit-Nejd Customs question ; (c) The Akhwan menace. (2) Relations with Iraq — (a) Exemption from taxation of date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikh of Koweit; (b) Position of Koweit vis-a-vis Iraq. (3) Relations with Persia. Internal Questions, 1919-28. {a) The Koweit Order in Council. 24. The question of extending the scope of the “ Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907,” had been under consideration before the War, but no decision had been reached upon it, the difficulty in respect of Koweit having principally been the undesirability of taking action before a settlement should have been arrived at with Turkey in regard to the Arab Littoral. In December 1919 the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad again . L(Stter trom t , c . G . o{ raised' ::: ' the question of passing a jurisdictional Order in Council ior Koweit. i., Dec. 22 , 1919 , i\ 697 / 20 . The India Office expressed the opinion, however,! that, although the Order 1 1 . 0 . letter to f.o.. Junes was desirable in itself and though there would be advantage in issuing it at 1920 ’ ’ 2/33 2a an early date, it was desirable to postpone action until a decision had been taken on the machinery for the administration of the Mesopotamian Mandate and the effect of the Mandate upon the relations of His Majesty’s Government with contiguous countries. This view was accepted by the Foreign Officef + f.o. to 1 . 0 ., . 1 .me 14 and the matter was allowed to rest for a year. 1920 ' p - 4660/29 - 25. The question was again raised in the summer of 1921 by the High Commissioner in Iraq, who recommended (a view in which the Government •of India concurred)^ that the promulgation of an Order in Council need not rreUfrom^ viceroy ^ be further delayed now that Turkey was recognised as having lost suzerainty ] 92 i &gt; p. 1173/21 ■over the Principality. The matter was referred to the Colonial Office who, under the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee, had become responsible for policy on the Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf. On reference to the Foreign Office they were informed that, from the legal point of view and on the supposition that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, the status of that territory would seem to be governed by Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres under whichO, 0. to P.O., July 9 1921, P. 3078/21.

Turkey renounced in favour of the principal Allied Powers all rights and title over territories outside Europe not otherwise disposed of by the Treaty ; that, in practice, provided some prior agreement were reached with the Sheikh of Koweit, it would appear unlikely that any Foreign Powers would challenge the issue of an Order in Council on the lines of the Bahrein Order in Council of 191d (although the extension of British jurisdiction, as in that/'-&gt; order, to foreigners might involve the prior concurrence of some Foreign Powers), but that, while the High Commissioner in Iraq might be authorised to open negotiations with the Sheikh with a view to ascertaining the measure of British supervision which His Excellency was prepared to accept, the actual issue of an Order in Council consolidating any agreement that m ight be reached with the Sheikh should be postponed until the coming inlo force of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey. 26. No further action was taken until the Treaty of Lausanne had been signed and, owing to the necessity for departmental examination of the provisions of the Order, the approval of His Majesty to an Order in Council was not finally obtained until 17th March 1925. Under the Order in question jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons, the subjects and protected persons of non-Moslem foreign Governments, and Koweit subjects or the subjects of other Moslem Governments registered in the Office of the Political Agent as being regularly employed by British subjects or subjects of non-Moslem foreign Governments, was vested in the Political Agent subject to the general control of, and a right of appeal to, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It may be noted* that, no foreign Power having consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over its nationals in Koweit by His Majesty, the Political Agent was instructed, at the request of the Foreign Office, that, in the event of a national of a non- Moslem Power committing some crime or misdemeanour necessitating proceedings against him, or of such a person becoming involved in civil proceedings, the matter should at once be brought to the notice of Ilis Majesty’s Government who, on learning that such a case had arisen, would take steps to ascertain from the Government of the person concerned whether they desired that the case should be dealt with under the Koweit Order in Council. The Order in Council came into force in the 1st October 1925,1* but the concurrence of the Sheikh in the delegation of jurisdiction over the classes of person in question was not finally obtained until November 1925.if Since that date various Rules of Court and King’s Regulations have been issued under the Koweit Order in Council, but no point of importance has arisen in connection with its operation. 27 28 * * * 27. It may be recorded that, a clearer understanding as to responsibility, as between the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government, for the internal administration of Koweit having been reached by that stage, the preparation and issue of the Order in Council of 1925 were, by agreement with the Colonial Office, left to be dealt with by the India Office in conjunction with the Foreign Office. (b) The Bunder Shweikh Lease. 28. The question of terminating the lease of Bunder Shweikh, the earlier history of which is given in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, and the engagements entered into in connection with which by His Majestv’s Government are shown in the Precis of Treaties appended to the present Memorandum, came up for consideration on the conclusion of the W ar. After considerable correspondence during 1919-20, the Government of India recommended in April 1920 that the lease should be terminated as the Sheikh had maintained a consistently obstructive attitude towards His Majestv’s Government. Uncertainty as to the status of Koweit, under the Peace Treaty, and consideration of the political effect on the Sheikh of withdrawal of the subsidy which the rent of Bunder Shweikh in fact constituted, of the possibility of bringing pressure to bear on His Excellency in other ways, and of the question of retaining the site at a reduced rent, &amp;c., prevented a decision before the death of Sheikh Salim in February 1921. His Majesty’s Government subsequently decided in consultation with the Government of India to terminate the lease of the Bunder Shweikh lands, while agreeing,-a§ they had no present use tor the wireless buildings erected on those lands, J&gt;esp-from r.c ;) Iraq, to to the use of the buildings in question by the Sheikh of Koweit as a 2 L ’ quarantine station for the town. The High Commissioner for Iraq reported in August 1922 that this decision had been communicated to and accepted by the Sheikh. There have been no further echoes of this question since /*\ that date.. It should be noted, however, that while the lease has been terminated, the Agreement does not appear to have been abrogated, and that the reciprocal pledges exchanged on its conclusion in 1907 presumably, therefore, remain binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. Oil in Koweit. 29. In concluding the review of the more important post-war internal developments in Koweit, reference may conveniently be made to the question of oil. The Sheikh bad agreed in 1913 fsee para. 10 above) not to grant an oil concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. Here, as in Bahrein, the question of obtaining a concession w'as revived by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1921, and His Majesty’s Government, vdio were anxious to facilitate the establishment by the Company of control over the oil resources of the north Arabian coast, agreed to the institution of negotiations, which w^ere conducted through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Lengthy negotiations have, however, so far proved unfruitful. (The general question of oil in the Gulf is dealt with in the Board of Trade Memorandum on page External Questions, 1919-28. (1) Relations with Ibn Saud. (a) Koweit-Nejd-Iraq Boundary Question. 30. Owing to the non-ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, the boundaries of Koweit had, as explained above, been left in suspense on the outbreak of the War. Clause 6 of the Treaty concluded with Ibn Saud on the 20th December 1915, provided that the limits of Koweit territory should thereafter be determined. The question remained in a fluid state until the end of the War. 31. In January 1919, on Sheikh Salim proposing to build a fort at Major More’s Memo. Dauhat Balbul, just north of Jabal Manifa, Ibn Saud took exception, claiming P- 2417 ' 28 - that the site in question lay wdthin his territory. No overt act followed, but * relations on this subject became increasingly strained, customs difficulties— the Sheikh having placed an embargo on exports to Ibn Sand’s ports* — * Letter from ibn Saud to further aggravating the situation. Matters culminated in the surprise and p h 6924 / 2 o m, Jane21 1920 ’ defeat by Akhwan under Faisal-aJ-Dawish of the Koweit tribesmen, under Sheikh Dhaij, w r ho had been sent by Sheikh Salim to contest Akhwan occupancy of Jariyah, at Hamdeh, near Jariyah, on the 18th April 1920, from p. 6317 / 20 . which point the friction between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud became acute. The situation v'as briefly,*]' that the Sheikh claimed on his southern t Cp. tel. from c.c., frontier the boundaries represented by the green line in the map attached to 10003, S 1020 / n L ’ draft Anglo-Turkish Convention, which represented the area administered by p - 628 i/ 2 o. his father, Sheikh Mubarak, over the vffiole of which, however, by August 1920 he had no longer effective control. Ibn Saud, on the other hand, •claimed the southern portion of the area in question by virtue of the fact that the tribes ordinarily resident therein had since 1914 or thereabouts, been under his direct control, and not under that of Sheikh Salim or his predecessor, Sheikh Jabir. 32 * * 32. During the summer of 1920, His Majesty’s Government, with a view to determining the dispute, on which they had been approached by both partiesj, authorised Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner in Iraq, to discuss the matter with Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. Ibn Saud formally claimed§ the whole country up to the walls of Koweit, “as in the time of Colonel Belly,” and maintained that he had no cognisance of the boundaries of Koweit agreed between us and the Turks in 1913, and that such an agreement could not in any case be operative against him, especially ns he had himself recovered the El Hasa province from Turkey before the ^ Tel. from P.A., Koweit, to H.C., Iraq, 76 C\, Aug. 15 1920 (K.), P. 6924/20; tel. from C.C., Baglidad, Aug. 19 1920, to S. of S. for I., See.

Sheikh Salim, on the other hand, claimed to take advantage of the frontier agreed upon between Turkey and His Majesty’s Government, as embodied in the draft Anglo-Turkish Convention. Sir P. Cox, having heard both sides and formed his own conclusions, recommended that a meeting should be arranged during the winter of 1920 between the principals with a view to settlement. At this stage Sheikh Salim (who, like Ibn Sand, had given an undertaking in writing to refrain from aggression pending the settlement of the issues by the mediation of llis Majesty’s Government), having failed to demobilise a considerable force which he had gathered together at Jahra, at the head of Koweit Bay, was attacked by the Akhwan and an inconclusive if bloody fight ensued (October 1920). j| Tel. from H.C., Iraq, to S. of S. for I., 13944, Nov. 16 1920 : tel. from H.C., Iraq, to S. of S. for I., Dec. 14 1920.

Thanks to the good offices of the High Commissioner, it proved possible to avoid further hostilities, and negotiations continued until the early part of 1921. In December 1920 Jbn Sand, who in November) had been invited to visit Basra with a view to reaching a settlement under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government, expressed his willing ness to accept the ex parte decision of the High Commissioner, but stated that he was unable to go to Basra owing partly to ill-health, and partly to internal political difficulties. In January 1921, no settlement having yet been reached, the Sheikh of Mohammerah offered to send his son Sheikh Chasib, accompanied by Sheikh Ahmed el Jabir, nephew and heir presumptive of the Sheikh of Koweit, to Nejd^j to endeavour to arrange a truce between Ibn Sand and Sheikh Salim. His offer was accepted and the mission left for Bahrein en route for Nejd in February, reaching Ibn Sand’s camp to the north of Riyadh on the 2nd March. On the 4th March the news of the death of Sheikh Salim arrived, whereupon Ibn Saud stated that there was no longer any quarrel to settle or any need for a frontier between his territories and those of the Sheikh of Koweit‘ :;: '—an arrangement with which Sheikh Ahmed (whose succession was recognised by His Majesty’s Government, who renewed to him the assurances given to Sheikh Salimf), was reported at the time to be quite satisfied. (Jbn Saud had already been informedj before the death of Sheikh Salim, that His Majesty’s Government recognised the territory within the inner boundary (the red circle) shown on the map attached to the Anglo-Turkish Agreement as definitely appertaining to Koweit and not open to dispute). 34. No further developments took place until November 1922, when at P 115 / 23 . the Conference held at Ojair from 27th November to 3rd December between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Saud (the Political Agent, Koweit, also being present) the Koweit-Nejd frontier came up for consideration. It was recognised at once that the power of the Sheikh of Koweit in the desert was much less than it had been at the time of the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913, and a settlement was finally reached under which the frontier as between Nejd and Koweit starts from the junction of the Wadi al Aujah with the Batin on the west; running thence (leaving Riqai to Nejd; in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of latitude with the red semicircle on the map attached to the draft Anglo-Turkish agreement, and reproduced in Map II appended to this Memorandum ; thence following the red semicircle to the sea south of Ras al Qulaiah. The southern boundary of the recognised territory of Koweit was defined as above. It was simultaneously agreed that the tract of country bounded on the- north by the above line, on the west by the Shaqq, on the east by the sea, and on the south by a straight line running eastward from the Shaqq in the west through Ain al Abd to the sea north of Ras al Mishab, should be Koweit Diary for Dec. 1-8 recognised as common to the two States of Nejd and Koweit, who were to 1922, para, 195, p. 463/23. enjoy equal rights in it until such time as afresh agreement should be arrived at between them regarding it through the good offices of His Majesty’s Government. This frontier, which had been negotiated on behalf p. «u 5 / 23 . ^ ie Sheikh (Major More, the Political Agent at Koweit, representing his interests), was accepted by His Excellency on the 26th January 1923. ~ 35 * * 35. In April 1923 the Sheikh was informed that His Majesty’s Government Letter from h.c., Iraq, to recognised the frontier claimed by him as between Koweit and Iraq and the p.‘n: 5 ,S. eit ’ Apri1191923 ’ attribution to Koweit of the Islands of Warba, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakah,9 Auhal), Kubbar, Qaru, and ITnim-ei-Maradin—in other words, tlie frontier indicated by the green line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913. The frontiers of Koweit are accordingly as shown on Map II attacned to the present Memorandum. Since 1923 no difficulty has arisen in regard to them. ^(b) Customs dispute between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. • &gt;6. The difficulty is not a new one ; it dates from before the war. With the acquisition of El Hasa by Ibn Saud in 1913, Nejd acquired a sea front, but the sea front in question contained no port of any real value, and the efforts made from time to time by Ibn Saud, with the assistance at intervals of His Majesty’s Government, to secure that steamship lines such as the British Indian Steam Navigation Company should call at Ojair or at Qatif, or to develop Ojair, Qatif or Jubail, have proved abortive. In these circumstances a friendly understanding with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit on the question of customs and transit dues is of great and evident importance to the Ruler of Nejd. Agreement with Bahrein, on the basis of a transit duty of 2 per cent., was reached in 1920, after long discussion and much ill-feeling, with the assistance of the Government of India. Agreement with Koweit, which in 1923 levied a 4 per cent, duty on imports and a further 4 per cent, transit duty, has not yet been reached ; and since 1920 Ibn Saud has in consequence maintained an embargo on trade with Koweit with the result that the prosperity of the Principality, as indeed of Qasim and flail in Nejd, has been seriously affected. 37. The position is briefly that Ibn Saud, on the ground that it is impossible to collect import duty on the desert frontier between Kuwait and Nejd, is anxious for the establishment either of a Nejdi Custom House in Koweit town, or of an arrangement under which export duty only should be collected on his behalf at Koweit, a fixed sum being paid to Nejd instead of import duty. A third proposal,' :i: ‘ made in 1923 by the Sheikh’s cousin Abdullah-as-Salim, was that the embargo should be raised on terms which would have involved the payment to Ibn Saud, through an Agent and Collector stationed in Koweit (Abdullah-as-Salim himself), of the whole of the customs dues on goods exported from Koweit by land other than those destined for the Sheikh’s own subjects or for Iraq.f 38. Ihe objection of the Sheikh of Koweit to an agreement on the lines referred to above would appear to be due as much to the fear of allowing Ibn Saud to establish a stranglehold over Koweit as to anxiety to secure an arrangement which shall not be economically unsatisfactory from his own point of view. An arrangement which would enable Ibn Saud to collect his own dues in Koweit would, as the Government of India pointed out in December 1923, appear prirnd facie to contravene both Ibn Sand’s engagements to His Majesty’s Government, and those into which His Majesty’s Government have themselves entered with Koweit; while the extension in Koweit of the influence of the King of the Hejaz and Nejd would in any event be objectionable—the engagements to Koweit of His Majesty’s Government apart—on general political grounds. 39 * 39. I here has been no development of importance in recent }’ears, though the position cannot be satisfactory from the point of view of either Koweit or Nejd. A settlement which would be fair to both parties and unobjectionable from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government could best be reached on the lines suggested in July 1923 by the then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, which were accepted at the time by the Colonial Office and the India Office. Colonel Knox’s recommendation was that steps should be taken to obtain the agreement of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, firstly to the appointment of a Customs expert, preferably from India, to advise on the reform of the Koweit Customs, and on the shares of the Customs revenue to be apportioned to Nejd and Koweit respectively, and, secondly, to the appointment for five years of an official to serve under the control of the Political Agent and carry out the recommendations made by the Adviser. But in February 1924 the Political Resident reported that, proposals on these lines having been put to the interested parties, “ neither Ibn Saud nor 2979c B P.1276/24. P. 2999/23. * Cp.

Koweit was stated by the Political Agent, Koweit, to be thinking of paying I bn Sand a visit, the real object of which would be to induce him to remove the trade prohibitions, and though in hebruary 1928 the Political Resident reported that the effect of the embargo was to create stagnation in Koweit trade, the commercial^ prosperity of Koweit depending on Nejd, there has been no development in the matter since that date. (c) The Akhwan Menace. 40. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925,J but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the Principality.§ At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty’s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on 27th January 1928,]| and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again successfully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two da\ 7 s. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty’s Govern ment under existing engagements for the “ protection of Koweit ” (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument^), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive, cp. para. 47 below), was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained, on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed that His Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the ui.dei '■landing that they would be used only for defence, and would not cioss the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn duimg the late spnng. for financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars.** 41. Consequent on the breakdown of the negotiations with Ibn Sand in the summei of 192S. and the possible danger of a revival of Akhwan activity on the Iraq-Nejd border, the question of granting discretion to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, to carry out reconnaissances by air or car over Koweit territory was raised by the Air Ministry. 41 41. 1 he “ very obvious and grave political objection ” to air recon naissance over Koweit was emphasised by Sir Gilbert Clayton. After considerable discussion between the Departments concerned, the Air Officer Commanding was finally authorised to carry out occasional reconnaissances both by air and car. at his discretion, on the understanding that the concurrence of the Sheikh should be obtained, through the Political Resident; that reconnaissance should be carried out as Infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible; that the Sheikh should be given “no grounds for supposing that the Royal Air Force have assumed responsibihfy for the defence of Koweit or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect”; that save in case of real emergency reconnaissance should not be carried out within 25 miles of the Nejd-Koweit frontier nor in the immediate vicinity of the Nejd-Iraq11 frontier in the neighbourhood of the neutral zone ; and that the authority given should operate only for the period of the present emergency. The question of the establishment of an advance air base in the event of a raid was reserved for further consideration if and when the need arose. (2) Relations with Iraq. (1) Question of exemption from taxation of date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikh of Koweit. 4d. As will be seen from para. 12 above, one of the guarantees given on 3rd November 1914 to the Sheikh of Koweit was that his “ date gardens on the lurkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab should remain in full possession of you and your heirs and immune from taxation.” 44. At the time when the Financial Agreement, arising out of Article 15 of the Anglo-lraq Treaty of 10th October 1922, was under the consideration of 11is Majesty s Government, it was proposed that a provision to safeguard the right of the Sheikh under the guarantee referred to above should be inserted. Ihis proposal was subsequently abandoned, and the High Commissioner was instructed in November 1923 to treat this obligation separately under Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty. Owing to an oversight, the point was omitted when the exchange of Notes defining the obligations of Iraq and His Majesty’s Government under Article 10 of the Treaty took place; and on the matter coming to notice some other method of safeguarding the rights of the Sheikh under the guarantee in question hod to be devised. The Iraq Government, on being approached, expressed the opinion that the immunity in question could not properly be continued in the circumstances without the authority of a special law, and that, if special legislation were introduced, it would be rejected by the Iraq Parliament. They stated that they were, in the circumstances, unwilling to take the responsibility of introducing such legislation, and desired that the matter should be referred to His Majesty’s Government. 45. The foreign Office, Colonial Office and India Office agreed that there was no ground on which His Majesty’s Government could justify the discontinuance of the immunity from taxation hitherto accorded to the Sheikh of Koweit, as to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. After considerable discussion it was, however, decided that it was undesirable to give prominence to the question by the insertion in the revised f inancial Agreement of a provision to cover it if any other method of safeguarding the position be found ; and that this might be regarded as having been attained if the Iraq Government accepted the reference in the Memorandum accompanying Article 3 of the revised Treaty between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq (which provided for the recognition by the Iraq Government of British international obligations in respect of Iraq) to the immunity from taxation of the date gardens of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah as one of the international obligations in question. No objection having been raised to the inclusion of the undertaking in question bv the Iraq delegates, His Majesty’s Government in January 1928 placed on record their assumption that the Iraq Government v r ere now prepared to recognise those undertakings as pait of the international obligations which His Britannic Majesty had undertaken to see carried out in respect of Iraq, and to recognise that they had inherited the duty of ensuring that those undertakings were fully discharged. The High Commissioner was instructed to inform the Iraq Government accordingly, and to endeavour to induce them to agree to continue to afford to the two Sheikhs in question immunity from taxation in respect of their date gardens in Iraq. His Majesty’s Government added that, should the Iraq Government, while prepared to honour those under takings, feel doubtful of their ability to persuade the Iraq Parliament to pass the necessary legislation, it would be for consideration whether King Feisal should not be requested to pass an Ordinance in accordance with Article 26 (3) of the Iraq Constitution to give effect to them, His Majesty’s Government, taking the view that their fulfilment might be regarded as a treaty obligation on the part of Iraq which the Government of that country might be called upon to fulfil under Article 4 of the Treaty of 10th October 2979c P See P. 4637/27.

No information is available as to any subsequent developments. (2) Position of Koweit vis-d-vis Iraq. - 4b. Under the engagement of 1914 between His Majesty’s Government and tiie Sheikh of Koweit, the Principality of Koweit is recognised as an independent Principality and as entitled to the protection of His Majesty’s Government, by whom, as stated in para. 35 above, the present Koweit-lraq boundary was recognised in 1923. Formally, therefore, there is no question of its absorption by Iraq. The Political Resident in the Persian Gull has, however, recently drawn attention (as the result of an incident in which an Iraq officer was alleged lo have despatched an Iraq police inspector to Koweit to arrest and bring back an offender from there) to the danger of Koweit and Iraq becoming, in the minds of the native community, unified under British protection. Sir Lionel Haworth remarked'^’ that it must be an essential part of our policy that Koweit should be kept apart from Iraq—it is inevitable that it shoidd be the tendency of Iraq gradually to assimilate Koweit even if there is no conscious knowledge of the Jact among the officials of the Iraq Government. Such tendencies result, not from direct action, but from psychological factors, from the dependence of the Sheikh of Koweit upon Iraq for assistance, from the appointment of Iraq officers to Koweit during the raids, and from the common interests of people, alike in race and religion, depending upon the same market centres and in constant daily communication. It is, indeed, perhaps the natural development that Koweit should draw close to Iraq while we are there, but we do not desire her to get so close that, with the development of time, she would be left there when we leave in spite of our wishes . . . It is for us to see . . . that such help as Koweit may require may be obtained from assistance from our Navy and the training of her people—and it would be, better that such training should be given from India and not from Iraq. Koweit should be trained to look to His Majesty’s Government and India alone and not to a country under our Mandate.” 47. I he Political Resident had earlier in I92«S urged the undesirability from the point of view alike of the immediate situation and of our future policy of linking Iraq and Koweit in the mind of Ibn Sand by establishing an air base against Akhwan raiders in Koweit territory. He reiterated his objections in connection with the proposals dealt with in paras. 40 and 41 abo\ e. On both occasions the Government of India expressed their general agreement in the view taken by him. (3) Relations with Persia. 48. No question affecting the relations between Koweit and Persia appears to have arisen in the period now under consideration, and it would be unnecessary to refer to the relationship between the two countries were it not for the information which has recently been received that a Persian instruction has been issued to the local Persian officials in the Gulf that the Persian Government can recognise no Arab rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and that all persons belonging to and arriving from Koweit (as from Muscat, Bahrein and the Trueial Sheikhdoms) are to be considered Persian subjects, and Persian passports to be issued to them. 49. It is impossible at the present stage to estimate the importance to be attached to the information quoted above. It may, however, be placed on record that no evidence has been traced of effective exercise'in the past of Persian authority in Koweit. The two incidents on which a Persian claim might possibly be based are—first, that Koweit was regarded in 1775 as a dependency of Basra, and that a claim might therefore be put forward in view of the fact that Persia had occupied that town from 1775 to 1779, even though Persian authority does not appear in the same period to have extended to Koweit. The second and more important incident is that of 1899. InOctober of that year it was ascertained that the Sheikh of Koweit had undoubtedly applied through the Sheikh of Mohammerah to be taken under Persian protection. Mr. Lorimer suggests that this move, which the Sheikh, it is stated, took no pains to conceal, was perhaps contrived by His Excellency merely with a view to testing the degree of interest taken in Koweit by His ^Majesty s Government. I he Sheikh’s advances were, however, in any case rejected by the Shah. C.—Summary. 50. In conclusion, it may be remarked that, while the present Sheikh is far from an outstanding personality, internal conditions in Koweit at the present time show a marked improvement on the position on the death of Sheikh Salim in 1921. In August 1920f local feeling was reported to be running high against Sheikh Salim, owing to the loss of trade resulting from his quarrel with Ibn Saud, to his general incapacity as a ruler and to his total lack of tact, and it would appear that a coup d'etat was more than a possibilityJ had not the Sheikh died at a critical period of the Koweit-Nejd boundary negotiations on 23rd February 1921. Under the present Sheikh, while the customs dispute with Nejd remains an open sore and the activity of the Akhwan a standing menace, matters may on the whole, be said quite definitely to have improved. The boundary question has been settled and on a basis not unsatisfactory from the point of view of Koweit; the question of British jurisdiction within the Principality has equally been regularised; internal conditions are not such as to call for serious animadversion and, while the Sheikh, as stated above, is not an outstanding personality, he is not only well disposed towards His Majesty’s Government but, from the point of view of internal administration, may be regarded as a not inefficient ruler when judged by Arab standards. 51. On a broad view, the importance of Koweit is less great from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government than that of Bahrein or of Muscat; but its absorption, or the establishment in it of a dominating influence, by Ibn Sand, could not but react injuriously on the position of His Majesty’s Government alike in Iraq and in Bahrein and along the Trucial Coast. Hitherto it has been possible to maintain British influence without substantial interference in the internal affairs of the Principality ; the recent activities of the Akhwan have led to formal appeals by the Sheikh to the guarantees of protection which he holds from His Majesty’s Government, and it is to be hoped that the standing threat to his independence constituted by his powerful neighbour in Nejd and the effective assistance given him against the Akhwan during the present year may help to continue to keep him generally amenable to British influence. The desirability, at the same time, of securing that the Sheikh shall not escape absorption by Ibn Saud only to end by absorption in an Iraq, no longer under British mandate, and the increased importance which his Principality, situated at the head of the Gulf, will assume as British control decreases in Iraq, cannot be overlooked in considering the general policy to be adopted in the Principality by His Majesty’s Government. D.—Points referred to Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 52. The points in connection with Koweit which have been specifically mentioned in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub- Committee are :— (a) Whether the maintenance of the independence of Koweit (as of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs) which is constantly threatened by Ibn Saud, is necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured ? (P.G. 3 viii, P.G. 0 (2) c. i.) (5) The position as between Iraq and Koweit—desirability of keeping Koweit clear from absorption in Iraq, or from coming under Iraq influence. (P.G. 0, 2 (5) (3).) (c) Extent to which His Majesty’s Government should increase or decrease the interest taken and the control exercised by them in Koweit. (P.G.

In this connection the Government of India have expressed the view that the maintenance of the independence of Koweit (as of Muscat, Bahrein, and the Trucial Chiefs) is necessary in British interests ; that the veiled protectorate at present exercised over them by His Majesty’s Government ^ suffices against European encroachments; that so long as we do not alienate j- Arab opinion by attempting undue westernisation it suffices also against' encroachments by Wahabi State, and that if need be, it can be more explicitly asserted.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a telegram addressed to me by tne Political Agent at Kuwait on the suuject of an Iraq officer naving despatched an Iraq Police Inspector to Kuwait to arrest a man there and return with him. Ine particular incident h^.a no importance, as such; it is the action of a subordinate? officer and will be righted by a deni-official letter to the officer in charge. But psychologically it h&amp;e great importance. It shows the tendency, which I foresaw, of Kuwait and Iraq becoming, in the minds of the native caKKU&amp;ity, unifiea under Britieh protection. Xt has been common talk in the bazaars of Basrah in the past thet Kuwait must join up either with Ibn Baud, with Iraq or Great Britain* It must be an essential part, of our policy that Kuwait should be kept apart from Irsq - it is inevitable that it should be the tendency of Iraq gradually to assimilate Kuwait even if there is no conscious knowledge of the fact among the officials of the Iraq Government. Such tendencies result not from direct action but from psychological factors, from the dependence of the Shaikh of Kuwait upon Iraq for assistance, from the appointment of Iraq officers to Kuwait during the raids and from the common interests of peoples alike in race and religion, dependent upon the same market centres and in constant daily communication. It is indeed perhaps the naturalnatural development that Kuwait should draw close to Iraq while we are there , hut we do not desire her to get so close that with the development of time she will be left there when we leave in spite of our wishes . Hence the last paragraph in my telegram No. 7 , dated 11th February, 1928, to your address (repeated to the Government of India under No. 137). It is for us to see that where avoidable the psychological factors do not arise, and that where they are natural that they are checked; that such help as Kuwait may require may be obtained by assistance from our Navy and the training of her people - and it would be better that such training should be given from India and not from Iraq. Kuwait should be trained to look to His Majesty’s Government and India alone not to a country under our mandate.

I liare caused enquiries to be made of the ’iraq Govemnont irr^o the oiroumstfiuncee of the police Inspector*3 visit and I am informed that the Inspector was granted three days leave to proceed to Kuwait in order to collect a prirata debt owed to his father. AB he did nut know the debtor by sight he took with him a friend to whom the debtor was known to assist him to identify the latter. This accounts for the endorsement on the pass granted by the Assistant passport Officer permitting him to 'proceed to Kuwait and return with one man only', which appears to hare been misinterpreted by the political Agent, Kuwait, and by yourself. The Inspector did not travel on duty or in uniform and there was no question of arresting the debtor. The Inspector obeyed the instructions of the Political Agent to return to ’Iraq and was put to the expense of hiring a special, car to take him to H&amp;srah. 3. It would, therefore, appear that there has been a misunderstanding and that the circumstances were not suchsuoh as you were led to suppose. 4. It is true, however, that an irregularity of a comparatively minor nature occurred in that the police Inspector was not in posaeasicn ci a proper passport. I am informed that it has been the practice to grant ttovranment officials wishing to proceed to Kuwait on fcnort visits temporary passes instead of regular passports. Although no objection appears to have been raised hitnerto by the Kuwait authorities, instructions have nos been issued that tnis practice must cease. 5.

Letter from Tiib Hon’ble the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, No. 21—S., dated / *''** * * * § *v he 13th Deckaber 1927. I have the honour to forward for the inform ation of the Government of India a copy of a n te on the Principality of Kuwait at the end of the year 1927, which I had instructed Major J. C. More, D S. O., the Political Agent, to draw upT The details o ,; the tribes make clear the situation with Ibn Sa ; ud on the ; Iraq frontier. The principality of Kuwait is an independent Arab state under a virtual British Protection. It has a distinctive flag of its own : red, with the word “Kuwait'' in Arabic characters in white across it. Boundaries :—The question of the status and territory of the Shaikh of Kuwait was the sub ject of negotiations between His Majesty's Government and the Sublime Porte in 1913,* as a result of which the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913,t was signed—but never rati fied. Be this agreement the autonomy of the Shaikh of Kuwait was recognised in an a”ea, the boundary of which formed a semi-circle with the t wn of Kuwait as centre and the Khaur az-Zubair on its radius to the north and Qurain to the south, together with the Islands of Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan Failakah, ’ Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru, Maqta’ and Umm al-Maradim, and their adjacent islets. It was further recog nised that the Shaikh of Kuwait was the Tribal over-lord, and entitled to levy tribute, within a larger area, the boundary of which started from the south side of the Khaur az-Zubair at its junction with the Khaur ' Abdullah and passed just to the south of Umm Qusr, Safwan and Jabal Sanam and on to the Batin ; it then turned south-west and followed the Batin to Hafar al-Batin; it then turned south-east, and included the wells of Safah, QPrah, Habah and Wabrah, and the village of Antab and joined the sea at Jabal Manifah. This Anglo-Turkish Agreement, however, as stated above was never r.iiified. During the rule of Shaikh Salim, the ques tion of the boundary between his territory and that of Ibn Sa’ud became very scute, and resulted in the surprise and defeat of the Kuwait tribes men at Hamdh near Jaryah.J or Chryah as it should really be pronounced, in April 1920, and the battle of Jahrah in Oct ber of the same year. The question first arose in January 1919, when Shaikh Salim wanted to build a fort at Dauhat Balbul, just north of Jabal Manifah, to which Ibn Sa’ud objected, and clumed that it was within his territory. Nothing happened until April 1920, when Ibn Shuqair started to build the Ikhwan village of Jaryah, but from then ■onwards the relations between Shaikh Salim and * Secret External, December 1913, Nos. 1—245. + Ibid. ^Enclosure to Serial No. 2 in File 387—X of 1923. Ibn Sa’ud went from bad to worse. During the summer o 1920, both parties applied for British arbitration, and both were asked to state exactly what territory they claimed. Ibn Sa’ud* replied that he claimed the whole country up to the walls of Kuw r ait; and Shaikh Salim claimed a frontier similar to the enter line of the Anglo- Turkish Agreement. Ti.e High Commissioner for Iraq then invited Ibn Sa’ud to Basrah with a view to settling the dispute, but Ibn Sa’ud replied that he was ucatle to come at the time, lu January 1921, the Shaikh of Mubammarah offered to send his son Shaikh Cl adb, accom panied by Shaikh Ahmad al-Jab : r ]of Kuwait, to Najd, to try and arrange a truce between Ibn Sa ud and Shaikh Salim. His ofLr was accept ed, and the mission left for Bahrain en route for Najd in February, and reached Ibn Sa’ud’s camp to the north of Riyadh &lt; n the 2nd Marih. Two days later the news of Shaikh Salim’s death reached them, and Ibn Sa’udf at once said that there was no longer any quarrel to settle, or any need for a boundary between his territory and that of Kuwait. Ibn Sa’ud hadj already been told that His Majesty’s Government recognised the territory within the inner boundary of the Ang'o-Turkish Agreement as definitely belonging to Kuwait. Nothing more happened regarding the frontier until November 1922,§ when at a Conference held at ’ Uqair between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Sa’ud, at which the Political Agent was also present, the question of a frontier bet ween Kuwait and Najd came up for discussion. It was recognised atfonce that the power of Ibn Subah (to give the shaikh of Kuwait his desert title) was much less in the desert than it had been when the Anglo-Turkish Agreement was drawn up, and an agreement was eventually arrived at by w T hich the frontier starts from the junction of the Wadi al-’Aujah with the Batin on the west. From this point, leaving Riqa’i to Najd, it runs in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of latitude with the red semi-circle on the map attached to the draft Anglo-Turkish Agreement, j| and then follows the red semi-circle to the sea. The above forms the southern boundary of the recognized ter rite y of Kuwait, but the tract . f country bounded on the north by the above line, on the west by the Shaqq, on the east by the sea, and on the south by a straight line running eastwards from the Shaqq in the west, through ’Ain al- ’Abd, to the sea north of Ras al-Mish’ah, is recognized as common to the two states of Najd and Kuwait, in which both enjoy eqcal rights. In April 1923^ the Shaikh of Kuwait, was informed that His Majesty’s Government recognized the other frontiers claimed by him. The frontiers of Kuwait are accordingly as shown on the attac hed map. * Serial No. 2 in File No. 387-X—23. f Ibid, Enclosure 2 to Serial No, 16.

It is unnecessary to consider its early history. Suffice it to say that in May 1896 Shaikh Muba rak became Ruler of Kuwait on the assassination of his brother. It was he who raised Kuwait from a place of little importance to a flourishing princi pality. Under his strong rule it became a most attractive place to live in to the Arab mind, and the population of the town nearly doubled itself. It wmuld be difficult to speak too highly in praise of his devotion to the British Government. Shaikh Mubarak died* * * § in November 1915, and was} suc ceeded by his eldest son, Shaikh Jabir, a debonair and pleasant man, whose mildness and affability made him a popular Ruler. Shaikh Salim, another son of Shaikh Mubarak's, succeeded on his brother s deatht in February 1917. He was a very different type of man from his easy-going brother, being a stern Muhammadan and a very obstinate man. He had spent nearly all his life in the desert before he came to the throne, and hated all modern inventions. He was almost entirely to blame for bis quarrel with Ibn Sa ud and all the sorrow that it brought to Kuwait, and in short he did nearly as much harm to the State, as his father had done good. He diedj suddenly on the 23rd February 1921 to the undisguised joy of nearly all his subjects. It hal always been the custom for Shaikhs of Kuwait to rule personally and autocratically, and to avoid all delegation of authority. In the town it was their usage to give audience for an hour or two each morning in the market-place, and decide cases by direct judgement. On the death of Shaikh Salim, however, the townspeople, tired of the unncessary war with Ibn Sa'ud which he had led them into against their will, determined that in future they would have some say in the affairs of the State, and informed the members of the Subah family that they would only §accept as their Ruler one who would accept a council of advisers. Shaikh Ahmad,^ eldest son of the late Shaikh Jabir, was chosen as Ruler, and on his return from Najd an Agreement was drawn up between him and the people of Kuw r ait to the effect that all criminal cases would be decided in accordance with the Shar 1 or Religious Law; that in case of appeal, the written sta'ements of both parties and the Qadhi’s judgement would be submitted to the ’Ulama, whose decision would be final; that if both parties in a dispute agreed beforehand for a third party to arbitrate between them, his deci sion should hold; that the Ruler would seek advice in all masters—external as well as internal —which affected the town ; and that if any one had any suggestion to make for the benefit of the town or people, he would lay it before the Ruler, who would consult his people, and adopt it if they so advised. A council of twelve members was duly elected—six from the eastern half of the * S. E., July 1916, Nog. 1 38, Serial Nog. 1 and 6. t S. E., August 1917, Nos. 44-62, Pro. Nog. 46-47. + S.

M7. town, and six from the western—under the presi dency of one of the leading merchants, H^mad bin '’Abdullah as-Saqar. Since the early days of its election, however, this Council has never met, and in practice Shaikh Ahmad rules in much the same manner as his predecessors. He is a mild and pleasant man of much the same type as his father. His bluff, jovial manners make him an eminently suitable person ter his position in so far as the ceremonial part of his duties are c ncerned. Unfortunately, however, he has no strength of character, and is a lamentably weak Ruler. He is a right-minded man, and would normally like to do the light thing, but is easily swayed by his advisers — who are not always of the most desirable type. Like many weak men, he can at times be very obstinate. Although greatly desiring popularity, he is not very popular amongst his subjects, amongst whom he has the reputation of being mean. He is a strict Muslim, and is zealous in the enforcement of the prohibition against strong liquor, and also in the suppression of prostitution. He himself is a non- smoker. He is unquestionably well disposed towards the British, and is very fond of entertain ing in British style. He has a suite of rooms furnished like a European house, and is fond of cinematog aphs, cameras, cars, and other modern inventions. He frequently drives his own car. Shaikh Hamad al-Mularak, the Shaikh's uncle, officiates for him whenever he leaves Kuwait.. He is nine yeirs younger than his nephew, being thirty three years of age. His mother belonged to the Ajman trib ■. He is a quiet, shy man, with no great intelligence, and no strength of character. Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim was born in 1895. He is by far the strongest in character and most intelligent member of the Subah family. He is a well read man and can converse on many more subjects than the average man of his class. He is his cousin's only really dangerous rival. He is certainly an ambitious man, and there is little doubt that he had strong h &gt;pes of succeeding his father on his death in 1921, notwithstanding the fact that he is Shaikh Ahmad's junior by ten years. When Shaikh Ahmad was chosen as Ruler, Shaikh AbdulLh as-Salim started te w assist' him, and soon got a good deal of power into his own hands, which Ahmad with his easv going nature allowed him to do. He soon started issuing orders not as the Ruler's deputy, but in his own name, and it looked very much as if he were going to become the virtual ruler of Kuwait, and Shaikh Ahmad to remain a mere figurehead if that. After about two months, however, he overstepped the mark, by trying to introduce a sort of “ civil list', with fixed salaries for all the members of the Subah family, including Shaikh Ahmad. According to the scale which he drafted he himself was to get almost as much as Shaikh Ahmad, and far more than any of the others. This produced a very stormy scene between Abdullah and the rest of the family, at which Shaikh Jabir as-Subah, Mubarak's brother, who has since died, did some very plain speaking, and Shaikh Abdullah went into retirement, and did not appear in public again for some time.3 * Shaikh Abdill'h as-Salim next came into pro minence in May 1923. Ibn Sa^ud had sent* one Saiyid Hamzah al-Ghauth to Kuwait to represent him at a Conference at which ii was hoped to come t) an understanding regarding the vexed question of the Njad Customs with a view to the re-opening of trade between Najd and Kuwait. The negotiations proved entirely abortive and Saiy d Hamzah left Kuwait for Riyadh on the 19th May. He was accompanied, however, by Shaikh Abdullih as-Salim as representative of Shaikh Ahmad, who had written to Ibn Sa ; ud that he saw no hope of c'tiling to an agreement on the terms proposed by Saiyid Hamzah, so he Lad decided to let him return, and send a deput i- tion of his own, headed by Lis cousin. Shaikh Abdullah returned to Kuwait on 27th June, aM it became known that he had come to a private understanding with Ibn Sa’ud, by which the latter was to recognize him as bis agent in Kuwait, with whom alone he would correspond, and was to allow trade between Najd and Kuwait to be re-opened in return for the whole of the customs dues on exports from Kmvait by land (other than those for Kuwait subjects or for ’Iraq), which Shaikh Abdullah was to collect and remit to him. Shaikh Abdullah at first urged Shaikh Ahmad to settle the matter himself without consulting his people at all, but he refused to do this, and several meetings were held. Shaikh Abdullah nearly succeeded in persuading the people to take up his plan, and urge Shaikh Ahmad to agree to it, but some stood out firmly against it. shaikh Ahmad, after vacillating for several days, finally wrote to Ibn Sa ud rejecting his terms. Since then Shaikh Abdullah as-Salini has kept quiet, and spends most of his time at his house at Sha’b, outside the town. The only other members of the Subah worth noting are Shaikh Salman al-Hamud, who is rather a distinguished looking man of fortv-six. There is nothing in him, however, and he drinks. II is father was a younger brother of Shaik Mubarak. Shaikh ’Ali al-Khalifah, a grandson of Sh dkh Abdullah who was Ruler from 1866 to 1892, is a fat, cheery man of forty-four, who wears ringlets like a Bedouin and lives largely in the desert. He is the chief commander of the Kuwait forces in war, and the recognized expert on all things military. He is noted for his enormous appetite. Outside the Subah family, the people who have the most influence over the Shaik are :— Khan Bahadur Mullah Salih, his chief secre tary, who is a foxy, intrigueing little man, with plenty of brains. Khan Sahib Abdul Latif, bis Director of Cus toms. A very pleasant man of undoubted ability, but not fastidiously scrupulous. Abdul Aziz as-Salim, his agent in Basrah, where he normally lives. This man is a born intriguer, and it is common knowledge in Kuwait that he used to work—if he does not still do so— in Shaikh Abdullah’s interests against Shaikh Ahmad. ♦Enclc. 1 tr Serial No. 1 in file No. 438(ii)—X. of 1923. The above three individuals are actually in the Shaikh’s employ. The foil nving are influential notables:— Saiyid Hamid Bey an-Naqtb, a son of the late Naqib of Basrah and brother of the famous 8aiyid Talib Pasha. He lives p&gt;rtly in Basrah and partly in Kuwait, and owns property in both places. Unlike his brother he does not go in for politics, and, despite his high birth, he does not dispise business. To him belongs the credit of m iking the motor road from Kuwait to Zubair, and of farming the Kuwait-Iraq Motor Trans port Comp my. He is also the Ford agent in Kuwait. He is a well educated man, with charming manners and I an sure that what influence he has is for good. Hilal al-Mutairi is the leading pearl merchant of Kuwdt. Born and brought up in the desert with his tribe, he was fortunate at pearl diving when a young man, settled in the town, and is now by f ir the richest man in the place. He is still a Kedouin at heart : he has a very fine house, but I do not believe there is a chair in it—his reception rooms being furnished with rich carpets, cushions and camel-saddles alone. At the time of the recent “ revival ” when the Mutair became Ikhwan, he wavered for some time as to whether to join the movement himself or not, and got so far as to discard his head-rope and bind his kerchhf with a turban instead (the outward emblem of the Ikhwan). He soon made up his mind, however, and went back to the head-rope. Still, he is very strict, and strongly disapproves of smoking, etc. He has never lost touch with his tribe, and no Mutair i ever &lt; omes to Kuwait with out go ng to his house. He is consequently very well informed regarding the desert. He is an elderly man and his views are somewhat old fashioned, but on the whole his influence is for good. Shamlan al-Ali is the second largest pearl merchant in Kuwait, and is closely associated with Hilal al-Mutain. Like him he has great influence. He took a very strong line in opposing Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim’s Customs scheme in June 1923+—in fact, but for him it is probable that Shaikh Abdullah would have got his way, and Shaikh Ahmad been forced to agree to Ibn Sa’ud’s terms. Hamad bin Abdullah as-Saqar owns the biggest bort-building establishment in Kuwait, and has also interests in Iraq—in fact for the last year or two he has spent much more of his time there than in Kuwait. He had a very bitter hatred against the late Shaikh Salim on account of the needless wars he had inflicted upon Kuwait, and 1 think it is quite probable that he would have brought about a revolution before long if Shaikh Salim had not died w T hen he did—he had already sounded the Political Agent as to the possibility petitioning Government to depose him. It was Ham id as-Saqar who championed the proposal that the people w r ould not tolerate another absolute Ruler; and he was president of the Council which was elected at the beginnig of Shaikh Ahmadis rule—but which never functioned fSub-enclo. to Enclo. to Serial No. 7 in file No. 438(ii)— X. of 1923.4 Hamad al-Khalid is a dour, butkindly, old man of old-fashioned views. During the War he started to lead the Pro-Turk party—until Shaikh Mubarak made it clear that there was to be no Pro-Turk Party in Kuwait. There is now nothing anti-British about him. Shaikh Yusuf bin ’Isa is a schoolma-ter and intriguer who is mixed up with every underhand plot in Kuwait. There are of course many others who are in a position to influence the Shaikh but the above are the most important. Two other men, not Kuwait subjects, whose characters are wonh considering am 'Abdullah an-Nafisi and Shaikh Hafidh W ah bah. ’Abdullah an-Nafisi is Ibn Sa'ud’s Agent in Kuwait. He is a pleasant and tactful man, who is liked by everyone in the place. Though Agent to the Wahhabi King, he is one of the heaviest smokers I have seen. Shaikh [or Mull a) Hafidh W ahbah is an Egyptian who has been in Ibn Sa'ud's service for the last few years. He has the reputation of being rabidly anti-British, and is said to have been deported from 'Iraq during the War—though I do not remember his case myself—and was deported from Bahrain in 19*22.* Personally I think that his reputation is largely, if not entirely, unearned; and that he was really much more anti-Daly than anti-British—he certainly did dislike Major Daly, and probably said so in Bahrain. I was naturally very suspicious of him when he came here, and watched him carefully, but have never heard of him saying or doing anything in the slightest degree anti-British. He is a 'well educated man but does not give the impression of being in any way brilliant. Ibn Sa'ud is not w’ell off for educated men, and, with the exception of Dr. 'Abdullah Effendi Damluji, I think Shaikh Hafidh is about the best I have met. The Town of Kuwait now measures about three miles along the shore, having extended consider ably in recent years towards the east. Its greatest depth, about one mile, is near the centie of the town, where the long suburb called Murqab has grown out from it towards the south-east. The streets are irregular and winding, and the town is not laid out on any general plan. Most of the houses have only a ground floor, but appear higher, owing to a parapet-wall enclosing the roof. There are over forty mosques, of which nine are Friday congregational mosques. None of them have any architectural merit. In the year 1920 the existing Town Wall was built by the late Shaikh Salim. It is a little over four miles in length, and has three gates. In addition to the gates, which are protected by towers, there is a tow’er about every two hundered yards throughout the length of the w r all. The Inhabitants are for the most part Arabs of the'Utub,'Awazim, Rashaidah, Bani Khalid, Dawasir, 'Ajman, 'Anizah and Dhafir tribes, besides Arabs from Hasa, etc. There are also a large number of Persians (mostly engaged in menial pursuits) and many negroes. The Jewish community numbers about 160 souls, and the Christians only a few families. Indians have * F. No. 480-X—23. never 'made good’ in Kuwait, and are much despised. There are only three or four in the tow r n. The Population is believed to be somewhere in tie neighbour of 50,000. Education .—There are a great number of^ N schools of a sort in Kuwait. The Arabs conduct N at lea-t fifty two ; the Persians have eleven, and the Jews and Christians one each, making a total of at least sixty five. Of the Arab schools twenty seven are for boys and twenty five for girls. These schools are not under any control by the local Government. Most of the boys’ schools and all the girls' schools teach nothing but the reading of the Quran ; and up to the end of 1911 no higher form of education was available in the town. At present The American Mission School gives by far the best education in Kuwait, particularly as reeards English, but it only has twenty boys— which is about all it can accommodate. Ihe hlubarakiyah School was established in J 912, about the same time as the Mission School A sum of Rs. 85,000 was collected by public subscription, of which Ks. 40,000 w^as used tc build a school, with many large class-rooms and verandahs round a courtyard, and the balance kept as an endowment fund. It has a Board of Trustees in charge of its affairs. Its income is derived from the endow'ment and the fees for pupils, who pay Rs. 2 a month each. There is a headmaster and six assistant masters *rd about 220 boys, who are graded in classes. The curri culum includes the Quran, Traditions, canon law T , ethics, Arabic reading, composition and grammar, arithmetic, geography, history and English. It is thus far advanced from the usual mulla school, but even so it does not pretend to give more than a primary educat.on. The Ahmadiyah School was founded in the autumn of 1921 under the auspices of the Muslim Benevolent Association, wi h the ass stance of the present Ruler, after whom it was named. It has its own Board of Trustees. Its income is derived from the fees of siudente-, supplemented by annual contributions from benevolent residents, and it is therefore not on a very secure basis It has seven masters and 165 boys, and is carriculum is jhe same as that of the Mubatakiyah School, but it is planned to make it into a secondary school when—or if—they can get qualified masters at the salaries which they can afford to poy. The Orphanage School for orphans and other poor boys is supported entirely by one family of wealthy pe^l merchants. It has six masters and about 130 boys, and teaches the usual Quranic branches, with history and arithmetic in addition. There are eight other schools for Arab boys which teach a little arithmetic, in addition to the reading of the Quran. Persian Schools which teach writing and arithmetic, in addition to the reading of the Quran, are three in number ; while there are eight others which teach the last subject onlv. Agriculture .—In Kuwait and its environs is practically nil. There are no date plantations of any value, hardly any fields and not many kitchen gardens. The villages to the south-east of5 Kuwait, supply a limited but hioreatdng quantity of vegetables and melons. The chief agricultural Centre in the principality is Jahrah, where wheat, barley and lucern are grown, as veil as vegetables, a'd where there are some 2 500 date palms, agriculture of J hrah might be considerably r creased if m re money were sunk in it. The next most important agricultural centre is the inland of Failakah, where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches, also vegetables, and particularly carrots, which are of quite exceptionally fine qu'di y The Sea Fisheries. —Oi Kuwait are its only truly local p oduee ; thes-e are a valuable asset, besides fioat-ami-u eight nets and lines, traps ma le of ree i hurdles are also used the Hsh enter them at the flowing tide and are left behind at the ebb. The majority of the fish caught is con sumed locally hut a sm 11 ) roportion is dried and exported to Fasrah and elsewhere. The fisher men of Kuwait are mostly Arabs of the ‘ Awazim tribe, but there are also other Arabs and a few Persians. The boats used are practically all the excepti'iis being jalibauts. A few of the prirnative hu* airiyah*, or boats made of date branch’s are still used. Pearl Fishing is the most important trade •T Kuwait. The town possesses over seven hundred pearl boats, but many of these have not been at sea fer years, as owing to the increased demand for 1 hour elsewhere, it is impossible to find crews for them. The average number of boats from Kuwait which now visit the banks is not more than about 330, and this year it was ve'y much smaller. The Kuwait Pearling Fleet consists of tw&lt;» p irts : the small boats which fish off the Neutral Zone, Sudah and Huzum ; while the large boats go farther afield. The 1927 season Wos better than has been for three or four y ar, and the pearl market, which las been bad for some time is also better. Trade .—Kuwait owes its mercantile importance to its p’ avling and carrying fleets, and to its trade with India, and with ’Iraq and Persia — especially a lucrative smuggling trade. Also in normal years with the Interior of Arabia, par ticularly Qosim, for which it is the natural port. Since the beginning of 1922, however, this trade has been closed by Ibn Su’ud, who has prohibited his subj cts from trading with Kuwait at all. His reison for this action is that he says he is unable he collect his Customs dues on goods im- portel from Kuwait in the dese t, and that he wants to establish a Najd Customs House in Kuwait Town, an arrangement which the Shaikh of Kuwait has naturally never seen his way to accept. Other suggestions have been made to get over the difficulty : for example that import duty into Najd should be abolished, and that the Shaikh of Kuwait should levy export duty instead and pay Ibn Sa’ud a fixed sum, but up to the present it has not been possible to come to any agreement. This stoppage of trade between Najd and Kuwait is a most serious matter for Kuwait—as also for Qasim and Hail—and the prosperity of the town has been declining ever since. The people of Kuwait are nearly all of Najd origin, and net a few of the Kuwait merchants had partners in Buraidah and Unaizah, and even n &gt;w the affairs of Najd interest them much more than those of ’Iraq. Ibn Sa’ucl .—The great Wahhabi Ruler Faisal bin Turki as-Sa’ud who died in 1865 left his throne to his eldest son, ’Abdullah. The latter’s brother Sa’ud, however, rebelled against him and occupied Riyadh. ’Abdullah fled to Hail, and invoked the assistance of Ibn Rashid, who was then the most powerful man in Arabia. Sa’ud was defeated and killed, but ’Adullah soon realized that he had gained little, as Ibn Rashid annexed the Wahhabi country, and ’Abdullah was kept a prisoner in Hail until he died. Meanwhile the remnants of the Sa’ud, who would not submit to a foreign yoke had gone into exile, some to the Hijaz, and others, including Faisal’s fourth son ’Abdur Rahman, to Kuwait! Encouraged and helped by Shaik Mubarak, another bitier enemy of Ibn Rashid, Abdur Rahman underfook the task of freeing his land from the foreigner. An attempt in 1900, failed, but in the spring of l9iil ’Abdul Aziz bin ’Abdur Rahman al-Fsisal as-Sa’ud, the present “ Ibn Sa’ud ”, acting for his father, left Kuwait with a picked follow ing of tw&lt;&gt; hundred m&lt; n. When he armed near Riyadh, he halted his party and went on at dusk with fifietn men alone They m de their way unnoticed to the house of Ibn Rashid’s governor, into which they forced an entry and placed evt ry-one in it under arrest in ore room. They learned that the governor, as always had gone to the fort to pass the night for greater security. They accordingly waited in the house till he r* turned in the moring sur rounded by this badyguard. As the cortege approached the dcor, the sixteen rushed out sword in hand, and, after a brief struggle ’Abdul ’Aziz bund himself master of Riyadh. The following years were spent in recovering pro vince after province from the dominion of the foreigner. In the spring of 1913’Abdul ’Aziz, in whose favour his father had abdicated, swooped upon Hasa and turned the Turks out of the province lock, stock and barrel. Such was the state of affairs at the outbreak of the War—which affected Arabia bss then most parts of the world. When Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait renounced fealty to the Turk he really changed nothing. When Ibn Rashid marched against Ibn Sa’ud at the close of 191-t, although nominally he did so on behalf of the Turks, it was really only another hand in the old match betw r een the rival principalities of Riyadh and Hail. The rival forces met at Majma’ah, 120 miles north-west or Riyadh, and fought an indecisive battle, in which Captain Shakespeare who was with Ibn Sa’ud was killed. It was not till the beginning of November 19^1, however, that the long struggle w^as finallv brought to a close by the final surrender of Hail to Ibn Sa’ud. This brought not only the Jabal Shammar, but Jauf and all the surrounding country to the borders of Syna, under his sway. Ibn Sa’ud’s next campaign against the Hijaz started in the summer of 1924, the result of a quarrel which had long been simmering By the end of 1925 he had captured the Hijaz and expelled the Hashimite dynasty. Thus in twenty- five years did this extraordinary man raise himself from an exile in Kuwait to be King of the Hijaz and of Najd and its Dependencies. Ibn Sa’ud is now a man of about fifty years of age. He is at least 6 feet 3 in. in height, and of very dign fied and handsome appearance. He possesses an extraordinary charm ofThe 1 Ajman, usually pronounced'Aiman—the singular of which is 'Ajmi (Aimi)—are one of the most important tribes of Eastern Arabia. Pheir proper summer range is the Gulf lowlands from Taff to 'Uqair {'Ujair) enveloping the Hasa oasis on the norrh and east. Inland their count' ary stretches back over the Summan, and in winter as fir as Sudair, On the littoral they have sometimes straggled into Qatar, and fre- quentlv to, and beyond, Kuwait town. Some fettled ’Ajman, detached fr un the tribe, have for many years be n found in Kuwait town, and in the coastal villages to the south of it. The tribe is a strong one, although their claim to be able ro turn out over 10,000 fighting men, including 2,000 horsemen, is probably exaggerated ; yet there is little doubt that they number over 30,000 souls. In politics they have always been a shift ing ard inconstant factor. During the Ottoman occupa’ion of Has t and Qatif they were constant ly recalcitrant. Tiny welcomed Ibn Sa ud when he invaded Hasa in 1913, hut, once he was establhhed, liked him and his taxes no better than the Turks. In 1915 he organized a cam paign against them but was defeated in an abortive night attack, and his own brother, Sa’d, w'as ki led. Later on, with the assistance of a Kuwait force under Shaikh Salim, he hemmed them in near the Qat f coast. After being besieged for some time the ’Ajman surrendered to Shaikh Salim, who sent them to Kuwait, where Shaikh Mubarak accepted them, aginst Ibn Sa’ud’s wishes, who wished to further avenge his brother’s death. Soon after this Shaikh Mubarak died, and Shaikh Jabir, in order to placate Ibn Sa’ud, ejected the’Ajman from Kuwait territory. After making oveitures first to ’Ujaimi as-Sadun and then to Ibn Rashid, thev obtained permission from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly at Safwan. On the occasion of Ibn Sa’ud’s visit to Kuwait and Basrah in November 1916 a truce was arranged between him and the ’Ajman. In the middle of 1917 however Ibn Sa’ud induced the Awazim to leave Kuwait ter: it ry and settle in Najd. Shaikh Salim, who was then Ruler, retali ated by seducing the ’Ajman, who moved en maSxe into Kuwait territore Eventually after much eorresp ndence, Ibn Sa’ud agreed to restore the Awazim if Shaikh Salim would turn out the ’Ajman and cut off his relations with the Shammar. The Awazim were returned, but the ’Ajman remained in Kuwait territ ry. By the beginning of 1-H8 the question had become such a burning one that it was decided to take the tribe under British protection, and they were settled to the north of Zubair. Here they were guilty of so much raid ing that Ibn Sa’ud way eventually told that, so far as the British were concerned, there was no objection to his taking action against them. About a year later the ’Ajman again acknowledged their allegiance to Ibn Sa’ud and returned to Najd. Since then they have become Ikhwan. The paramount chieftainship of the ’Ajman is in the Hithlain family of the Naji’ah sub-section of the Mai’dh section of the tribe, the present holder being Dhaidan al-Hithlain. His head quarters is at Sarar (165 miles south of Kuwait). The chief sections of the tribe are the Arjah under Saikh Maui bin’ Jum’ah ; the Dha’in, under Shaikh Fahad bin Sa’d ; the Hadi, under Shaikh Nahar al-Mutalaqqim (recently in ’Iraq) ; the Hajraf, the Hajjan, the Hamad bin Rashid and the Hithlain, all under Nahar al-Mufalaqqim; the Khuwaitir; the Mahfudh, under Mabkhut al- Muqrad ; the Maidh, the Miflih, the Misra, the Rushaid and the Sulaifi, under Dhaidan al- Hithla n himself; the Shamir under Sultan bin Hithalain; the Shawawilah, under Fahad bin Hithlain ; the Sifran, under Mansur bin Shaft al-Munaikh; the Sulaiman, under Muhammad bin Must mi; and the Suraih. The Aivazim (singular Azimi) are a Bedonin tribe of the country to the south of Kuw r ait. About 250 non-nomadic families of the tribe are settled in Kuwait town, where one of the quarters is called after them; others possess the village of Dimnah to the west of Ras al-Ardh ; and a few more live on Maskhan island, or Mascban as it is always called. The tribe has no connection with another tribe of Awazim or Hawazim found in Central Arabia, especially near Jauf. These Awazim, who claim to be of Harb origin, appa rently first made their appearance in the neigh bourhood of Kuwait during the early part of the 19th Century. They are divided into two main sections, the Kuah and the Ghiyadh, of which the former takes precedence. Their paramount shaikh is Habib bin Jami of the Hadalin sub section of the Kuah. The tribe numbers about 4.009 souls. They are pastoral nomads, fishermen and pearl divers. They are large breeders of camels, sheep and goats, also a fair number of donkeys, but few horses. In Kuwait town the fishing trade is mostly in their hands. The Awazim are recognised as an inferior tribe and intermarry only amongst themselves and with the Rasbaidah. For many years the Awazim were the loyal subjects of Kuwait, and from a military point of view formed the backbone of Ibn Subahs state. During the rule of Sha : kh Salim the ques tion of their tribute was one of the chief causes of his quarrel with Dm Sa’ud. The nomads of the tribe have now become Ikhwan, and have natu rally oriented themselves towards Ibn Sa’ud. The Rashaid h (singular Rashidi) are an inferior tribe of Kuwait and the territory to the south of it. They number about 4,000 souls and are said to be of Hutaim extraction ; those in Kuwait town, who are largely of th^ Hirshan section, are not unfrequeotly called Hutaim—a term which is also applied to the Saluba, those despised tinker outcasts who are found all over Arabia. A few years ago the majority of the nomadic Rasbaidah became Ikhwan. The chief shaikhs of the tribe at present are Mutlaq al- Musailim (whom I last heard of in Laq) and Asi al-Musadim (who is with the Ikhwan). There are seventeen sections to the tribe, but no useful purpose is served by enumerating them. The Dhafir is an Iraq tribe of Bedouins whose winter habitation is the country to the south of the railway line between Zubair and Nasiriyah. In the summer they are mostly on the Umm al-Afur island, opposite Samawah. They have for some time been flirting wdth Ikhwanism. The Muntafik .—Or “Muntafiq” as the name is officially spelt in English in ’Laq, though I have never heard it pronounced that way, or spelt that way in Arabic—are a very large ‘ Iraq tribe, of which a portion are still Bedouin. We are only concerned with them here in that, amongst other places, they are found in the western deserton the right bank of the Euphrates—chiefly between Nasiriyah and Samawah. The Shammar.—Vfho used to be of such vital importance in the politics of Central and Eastern Arabia, have more or less f;&gt;ded out of the picture. Formerly the Southern Shammar were not only a powerful nomad tribe, but also masters of the oasis of Jabal Shammar. Their pai-amount Shaikh, Ibn Rashid, was not only chief of his own tribe, but was also ruler of a settled princi pality, of which Hail was the capital. Since the fall of Hail in 1921, however, they have fallen from their high estate, and have largely joined the Northern section of the tribe. Recent events in the Desert .—In 1923 a tendency began to be noticeable amongst Najd tribes to take refuge in Hr&amp;q fr&lt; m the exactions of Ibn Sa’ud. These even included some families from the most rabidly Ikhwan tribes like the Mutair—notably the Div6Mn, a sect of the Aul&amp;d Wasil sub-section Buraik section of that tribe. These refugees soon started raiding into Najd, at the direct instigation of King Faisal according to the popular belief in Najd, and made the state of the country more disturbed than it had been for years. The Kuwait Conference between Najd and Hrtiq and Trans-Jordania was watched with intense interest to see whether 'Iraq would agree to Ibn Sa’ud^s demand that such refugees tribes should be compelled to return. Big raids into, and from, Najd continued to take place in rapid succession until May 1925 when, under orders from the Hr&amp;q Government, these seceders from the Ikhwan tribes of Najd, who had taken refuge in Traq and had disturbed the peace of the frontier for so long, started to move tow r ards the Northern Jazirah. By the end of Jun&lt;; 1925 the country was free from them, and an immediate improvement in the state of the countiy followed. A long spell of quiet and more or less immunity from raids followed—doubtless due in part to the fact that the Ikhwan tribes were otherwise engaged, the Hijaz campa gn being then in progress. S~on after the fall of Jiddah at the end of 1925 many of the Ikhwan leaders returned to Najd. Some were bitterly disappointed th it the Hijaz campaign had n&lt; t offered better facilities for amassing plunder. Notable amongst these was Faisal ad-D^wish. No sooner Lad he arrived at Artawi)ah than he summoned his followers to prepare for a big raid against 'Iraq. Before he had time to set out, however, be received definite orders from Ibn Sa'ud forbidding him to proceed, and reluctantly disbanded his men. In April he visittd Sultan bin Humaid, paramount shaikh of the 'Utaibah, at Ghat ghat. From there an invitation was sent to Dhridan al-Hithlain of the ’Ajman, 'who joined them shortly afterwards. They then apparently took an oath binding them selves together for mutu *1 support in the event of Ibn Sa'ud washing to take punitive action against any of them. There continued to be much talk about the strained relations between Ibn Sa'ud and the leaders of the Ikhwan, par ticularly the three mentioned above, who were much dissatisfied with Ibn Sa’ud's idea of organiz ing a civilized government in the Hijaz, and his prohibiting them from raiding across the frontier. They argued that if as they maintained, the people of 'Iraq, Kuwait, etc., were not true Muslims, they ought to be allowed to fii:ht against them j if, on the other hand, Ibn Sa ud prohibited this, saying that they were not enemies, he had no right to prevent them from trading with them—as he did in the case of Kuwait. In the summer of 1927 a plot to murder Itu Sa'u l's son, Sa'ud, in Riyadh, and bis cousin Ibn Jiluwi at Hasa, at the same time, was dis covered and frustrated only just in time. In the early part of 1927, on the Persian Government refusing permission for the Imperial Airways to establish a service to India along the south coast of Persia, the suggesti'n was made that the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf might be followed instead, and Ibn Sa'ud was approached with a view to obtaining his permission for the route over his territory to be used. As was to be expected, the very idea of such a thing was anathema to the Ikhwan, and Ibn Sa'ud on the very strong advice of Ibn Jiluwi said that he could not agree. Next came the building of a Police Post at Baswah * or Busaiyah, as we usua'ly call it. The Ikhwan apparently connect it in their minds with the Air Route scheme, and think that it is destined to become an enormous petrol dump—hence their determination to destroy it. The Air Route scheme and Busai yah Post between them certainly seem to be the immediate causes, or, perhaps it would be better to say, the immediate excuses, of Faisal ad- Dawish and his Mutair getting out of hand, and going raiding in detiance of Ibn Sa'ud s orders. The real reason is that they, like all Bed mins, are parasites wh) do not earn their living in the world, and must be paid, or raid. The actual attack on Busaiyah Post, the raid on the Kuwait 'Uraibdar, or local Bedouin, et:. are too recent to require re apitul ting. At present the situation seems to be that Faisal ad-Dawish, as stated above, is acting in open defiance of Tbn Sa'ud. The 'Ajman and other tribes are quiet at present, but are rot a very reliable weapon in Ibn Sa'ud's hands. Ibn Sa'ud is c rtainly in a very awkward position ; he is obviously having very strong pressure brought to bear on him, hs it is hard to think that a man of his acumen can really think all that he has been writing in his recent letters of protest. It remains to be seen whether he will be able to bring Da wish to heel and re-establish his authority, or not. Personally I think he will do so through the Ulama, whom he has summoned to Riyadh. He has a very persuasive tongue, and they have great influence with the tribes, if he can make them see reason. Meanwhile, as far as Kuwait is concerned, the people are still in a state of nervous tension. The town wall has been repaired, and is manned every night. The village of Jahrah is also strongly held with a force of over three hundred men, including a body of specially engaged mercenaries, but not counting the Bedouin camped in the vicinity. Many alarmist rumours are current, and accurate news is at a discount. * File No. 475-N. 890 F&amp;PD.SKETCH MAP of KUWAIT andpf''** Minute Paper. 3►^2. Register No. P. 1341 SECRET.

There is 3 however, one point of interest on which he does not touch very fully, vis., the extent of protection which His Majesty’s Government is committed to give to the Sheikh in the event of^foreigi aggression. The wording of British commitments to the Sheikh are uniformly vague. The various phrases are:- POUT! AL GOMM.TVPiy 1 Q99 . The Sheikh was assured of the “good offices” of the British Government, subject to observance of the agreement (not to receive representatives of or grant concessions to other Pov/ers) then made. T hen the existence of this SEEN Previous Papers : 2069 d 2000 6.27 assuranceassurance was communicated to the Turks in 1911, Sir T. Grey added:- 'His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves tne right to interpret that term at their discretion’. See Sir A.

Section (9) refers:- ” (I) sun duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise that the to mi of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh 'obarak-us-Suba and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Tobarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs, etc., and all his arrangements at the present day snail remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak and to his heirs after him ' Although this reads like a sweeping guarantee of protection, it was apparently introduced only at the t last minute on the request of the Sheikh, in order to preclude the British Government, in the event of the ■ lease being taken up, from levying customs in the Sheikh’s territory. It might, however, be taken in the sense:- 'His Majesty's Government undertake to protect Koweit and its boundaries from aggression (by land or sea)', and it is apparently in this sense that the India Office took it at the time, this point is not mentioned in Sir A. Hirtzel’s note of 27th October, 1911. But even granted that protection is implied in Section (9), it apparently extends only to the neighbourhood of the town and its sea front - though presumably it must include aggression either by land or sea. ^4 (r. /\ . ^ 4 ^ fryv-t^Aj.

There appears to be no definite commitment to defend the whole of the Sheikh's territory: but the undertaking (if such it is) to protect the tom and its boundaries being at the time given unconditionally would probably be held to be still in force. As regards the hinterland, the question turns on the extent of obligation involved in the phrase 'an independent orincipality -under British Protection', and how iar tne recogniuion in 1923 of the frontiers ot Koweit (see end of page 1 of Resident's note) commits His Majesty's Government. /* ^Jr / ttl** * Am CmH&amp;K (£\}j\lAr tklM A* cltytK 4- , HA vtuT ^ #jC / (Tty** *** , 5.27/ V kT &lt; CONFIDENTIAL. f V ■ jetter from the Hon^ble the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, No. 21—S., dated the 13th December 1927. I have the honour to forward for the inform ation of the Government of India a copy of a n te on the Principality of Kuwait at the end of the year 1927, which I had instructed Major J. C. More, D S. O., the Political Agent, to draw up. The details o 1- the tribes make clear the situation with Ibn Sa ; ud on the ’’Iraq frontier. The principality of Kuwait is an independent Arab state under a virtual British Protection. It has a distinctive flag' of its own : red, with the word “Kuivait'’'’ in Ar.ibie ch-tracters in white across it. Boundaries :—The question of the status and territory of the Shaikh of Kuwait was the sub ject of negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Sublime Porte in 1913,* as a result of which the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913,+ was signed—but never rati fied. Bv this agreement the autonomy of the Shaikh of Kuwait was recognised in an a’-ea, the boundary of which formed a semi-circle with the t wn of Kuwait as centre and the Khaur az-Zubair on its radius to the north and Qurain to the' south, together with the Islauds of Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan Failakah, ’ Auhah, Kubhar, Qaru, Maqta’ and Umm al-Maradim, and their adjacent islets. It was further recog nised that the Shaikh of Kuwait was the Tribal over-bird, and entitled to levy tribute, within a larger area, the boundary of which started from the south side of the Khaur az-Zubair at its junction with the Khaur ’ Abdullah and passed just to the south of Umm Qusr, Safwan and Jabal Sanam and on to the Batin ; it then turned south-west and followed the Batin to Hafar al-Batin; it then turned south-east, and included the wells of Safah, Qa’rah, Habah and Wabrah, and the village of Anta’, and joined the sea at Jabal Manilah. This Anglo-Turkish Agreement, however, as stated above was never ratified. During the rule &lt; f Shaikh Salim, the ques tion of the boundary between his territory and that of Ibn Sa’ud became very acute, and resulted in the surprise and defeat of the Kuwait tribes men at Hamdh near Jary ah,} or GDryah as it should really be pronounced, in April 1920, and the battle of Jahrah in Oct ber of the same year. The question first arose in January 1919, when Shaikh Salim wanted to build a fort at Dauhat Balbul, just north of Jabal Manifah, to which Ibn Sa’ud objected, and claimed that it was within his territory. Nothing happened until April 1920, when Ibn Shuqair started to build the Ikhwau village of Jaryah, but from then onwards the relations between Shaikh Salim and * Secret External, December 1913, Nos. 1—245. + Ibid. ^Enclosure to Serial No. 2 in File S87—X of 1923. Ibn Sa’ud went from bad to worse. During the summer o 1920, both parties applied for British arbitration, and both were asked to state exactly w r hat territory they claimed. Ibn Sa’ud* replied that he claimed the w'hole country up to the walls of Kuwait; and Shaikh Salim claimed a frontier similar to the cuter line of the Anglo- Turkish Agreement. Tie High Commissioner for Iraq then invited Ibn Sa’ud to Basrah with a view to settling the dispute, but Ibn Sahid replied that he wms unatde to come at the time. In January 1921, rhe Shaikh of Muhamirarah offered to send his son Shaikh Cl asib, accom panied by Shaikh Ahmad al-Jab r 'of Kuxvait, to Najd, to try and arrange a truce between Ibn Sa ud and Shaikh Salim. His offer was accept ed, and the mission left for Bahrain en route for Najd in February, and reached Ibn Sa’ud’s camp to the north oi Riyadh on the 2nd March. Two days later the news of Shaikh Salim’s death reached them, and Ibn Sa’udf at once said that there was no longer any quarrel to settle, or any need for a boundary between his territory and that of Kuwait. Ibn Sa’ud hadj already been told that His Majesty’s Government recognised the territorv within the inner boundary of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement as definitely belonging to Kuwait. Nothing more happened regarding the frontier until November 1922,§ w T hen at a Conference held at ’ Uqair between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Sa’ud, at xvhich the Political Agent was also present, the question of a frontier bet ween Kuwait and Najd came up for discussion. It was recognised atonce that the power of Ibn Subah (to give the Shaikh of Kuwait his desert title) was much less in the desert than it had been when the Anglo-Turkish Agreement was drawm up, and an agreement was eventually arrived at by which the frontier starts from the junction of the Wadi al-’Aujah with the Batin on the west. From this point, leaving Riqa’i to Najd, it runs in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of latitude with the red semi-circle on the map attached to the draft Anglo-Turkish Agreement, || and then follows the ^red semi-circle to the sea. The above forms the southern boundary of the recognized tenito y of Kuwait, but the tract « f country bounded on the north by the above line, on the west by the Shaqq, on the east by the sea, and on the south by a straight line running eastwards from the Shaqq in the west, through ’Ain al- ’Abd, to the sea north of Ras al-Mish’ab, is recognized as common to the two states of Najd and Kuwait, in which both enjoy eq ial rights. In April 1923^1 the Shaikh of Kuwait, was informed that His Majesty’s Government recognized the other frontiers claimed by him. The frontiers of Kuxvait are accordingly as shown on the attached map. * Serial No. 2 in File No. 387-X—23. + Ibid, Enclosure 2 to Serial No. 16. £ Ibid, Enclosure 1 tc Serial No. 16. § Ibid, Serial No. 20 and Enclosure to Serial No, 21.

ENCLOSURE IN ■NDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S l Letter Dated Receiv; No. 17 m 19 15 M. r-o2 Adminidration .—Kuwait was founded about tbe beginning of the eighteenth century by some settlers of the ’ Utub, a sect of the ’Anizah, over whom the Sul ah family enjoyed predominance. It is unnecessary to consider its early history. Suffice it to say that in May 1896 Shaikh Muba rak became Ruler of Kuwait on the assassination of his brother. It was he who raised Kuwait from a place of little importance to a flourishing princi pality. Under his strong rule it became a most attractive place to live in to the Arab mind, and the population of the town nearly doubled itself. It would be difficult to speak too highly in praise of his devotion to the British Government. Shaikh Mubarak died* * * § in November 1915, and was| suc ceeded by his eldest son, Shaikh Jabir, a debonair and pleasant man, whose mildness and affability made him a popular Ruler. Shaikh Salim, another son of Shaikh Mubarak’s, succeeded on his brother's deathf in February 1917. He was a very different type of man from his easy-going brother, being a stern Muhammadan and a very obstinate man. He had spent nearly all his life in the desei’t before he came to the throne, and hated all modern inventions. He was almost entirely to blame for his quarrel with Ibn^ Sa ud and all the sorrow that it brought to Kuwait, and in short he did nearly as much harm to the State, as his father had done good. He diedit suddenly on the 2Srd February 1921 to toe undisguised joy of nearly all his subjects. It hal always been the custom for Shaikhs of Kuwait to rule personally and autocratically, and to avoid all delegation of authority. In the town it w r as their usage to give audience for an hour or two each morning in the market-pluce, and decide cases by direct judgement. On the death of Shaikh Salim, however, the townspeople, tired of the unnceesarv war with Ibn Sa ud which he had led them into against their will, determined that in future they would have some say in tee affairs of the State, and informed the members of the Subah family that they would only ^accept as their Ruler one w'ho would accept a council of advisers. Shaikh Ahni'ul,\\ eon of the late Shaikh Jabir. was chosen as Ruler, and on his return from Najd an Agreement was drawn up between him and the people of Kuwait to the effect that all criminal cases would be decided in accordance with the Shar’ or Religious Law; that in case of appeal the written sta-ements of both parties and the Qadhi’s judgement would be submitted to the ’Ulama, whose decision would be final; that if both parties in a dispute agreed beforehand for a third party to arbitrate between them, hi&gt; deci sion should hold; that the Ruler would seek advice in all maiters — external as well as internal which affected the town ; and that if any one had any suggestion to make for the benefit of the town or people, he would lay it before the Ruler, who would consult his people, and adopt it if they so advised. A council of twelve members was duly eHcted—six from the eastern half of the * S. E., July 1910, Nos. 1 38, Serial Nos. 1 and 6# T S. E., August 1817, Nos. 44-62, Pro. Nos. 46-47. £ S.

Nc. i&gt;17, town, and six from the western—under the presi dency of one of the leading merchants, H .mad bin ’Abdullah as-Saqar. Since the early days of its election, however, tlds Council has nevei met, and in practice Shaikh Ahmad rules in much the same manner as his predecessors. He is a mild and pleasant man of much the same type as his father. His bluff, jovial manneis make him an eminently suitable person ior his position in so far as the ceremonial part of his duties are concerned. Unfortunately, however, he has no strength of character, and is a lamentably weak Ruler. He is a right-minded man, and wouM normally like to do the light thing, but is easily swayed by his advisers - who are not always of the most desirable type. Like many weak men, he can at times be very obstinate. Although greatly desiring popularity, he is not very opular amongst his subjects, amongst whom he as the reputation of being mean. He is a strict Muslim, and is zealous in the enforcement of the prohibition against strong liquor, and also in the suppression of prostitution. He himself is a non- smoker. He is unquestionably well disposed towards the British, and is very fond of entertain ing in British style. He has a suite of rooms furnished like a Eur&lt; pean bouse, and is fond of cinematog aphs, cameras, ears, and other modern inventions. He frequently drives his own car. Shaikh Hamad al-Mubarak, the Shaikh’s uncle, officiates for him whenever he leaves Kuwait. He is nine ye &gt;rs younger than his nephew, being- thirty three years of age. His mother belonged to the Ajman trib . He is a quiet, shy man, with no great intelligence, and no strength of character. Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim was born in 1895. He is by far the strongest in character and most intelligent member of the Subah family. He is a well read man and can converse on many more subjects than the average man of his class. He is his cousin’s only really dangerous rival. He is certainly an ambitious man, and there is little doul t that he had strong h &gt;pes of succeeding his father on his death in 1921, notwithstanding the fact that he is Shaikh Ahmad’s junior by ten years. When Shaikh Ahmad was chosen as Ruler, Shaikh Abdullth as-Salim started to “ assist” him, and soon got a good deal of power into his own hands, which Ahmad wdth his easy going nature allowed him to do. He soon started issuing orders not as the Ruler’s deputy, but in his own name, and it looked very much as if he were going to become the virtual ruler of Kuwait, and Shaikh Ahmad to remain a mere figurehead—• if that. After about two months, however, he overstepped the mark, by trying to introduce a sort of “ civil list ”, with fixed salaries for all the members of the Subah family, including Shaikh Ahmad. According to the scale which he drafted he himself was to get almost as much as Shaikh Ahmad, and far more than any of the others. This produced a very stormy scene between Abdullah and the rest of the family, at which Shaikh Jabir as-Subah, Mubarak’s brother, who has since died, did some very plain speakings and Shaikh Abdullah went into retirement, and did not appear in public again for some time..3 .Shaikh AbcLUih as-Salim nexl came into pro minence in May 1923. Ibn Sa^ud bad sent* one Saiyid hainzab al-Ghauth to Kuwait to represent him at a Conference at which it. was hoped to come to an understanding 1 regarding the vexed question of the Njad Customs with a view to the re-opening of trade between Najd and Kuwait. 1 he negotiations proved entirely abortive and Saiy d Hamzah Mt Kuwait for Riyadh on the 19th May. He was accompanied, however, by Sha'kh Abdull.h as-Salim as representative of Shaikh Ahmad, who had written to Ibn Sahid thaf he saw no hope of coming to an agn ement on the terms proposed by Saiyid Hamzah, so he had decided to let him return, and send a deput i- tion of his own, headed by his cousin. Shaikh Abdullah returned to Kuwait on 27th June, a d it became known that he had come to a private understanding with Ibn Sa'ud, by which the latter was to recognize him as his agent in Kuwait, with whom alone he would correspond, and was to allow trade between Nojd and Kuwait to be re-opened in return for the whole of the customs dues on exports from Kuwait by land (other than those for Kuwait subjects or for Hraq), which Shaikh Abdullah was to collect and remit to him. Shaikh Abdullah at first urged Shaikh Ahmad to settle the mitter himself without consulting Ir.s people at all, but he refused tq do this, and several meetings were held. Shaikh Abdullah nearly succeeded in persuading the people to take up his plan, and urge Shaikh Ahmad to agree to it, but some stood out firmly against it. Shaikh Ahmad, after vacillating for several days, finally wrote to Ibn Sa ud rejecting his terms. Since then Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim has kept quiet, and spends most of his time at his house at Sha’b, outside the town. The only other members of the Subah worth noting are Shaikh Salman al-Hamud, who is rather a distinguished looking man of fortv-six. There is nothing in him, however, and he drinks. H is father was a younger brother of Shaik Mubarak. Shaikh ’Ali al-Khalifah, a grandson of Sh .ikh Abdullah who was Ruler from 1866 to 1892, is a fat, cheery man of forty-four, who wears ringlets like a Bedouin and lives largely in the desert. He is the chief commander of the Kuwait forces in war, and the recognized expert on all things military. He is noted for his enormous appetite. Outside the Subah family, the people who have the most influence over the Shaik are :— Khan Bahadur Mullah Salih, his chief secre tary, who is a foxy, intrigueing little man, with plenty of brains. Khan Sahib Abdul Latif, his Director of Cus toms. A very pleasant man of undoubted ability, but not fastidiously scrupulous. Abdul Aziz aK-Salim, his agent in Basrah, where he normally lives. This man is a born intriguer, and it is common knowledge in Kuwait that he used to work—if he does not still do so— in Shaikh Abdullah’s interests against Shaikh Ahmad. •Enclc. 1 tc Serial No. 1 in file No. 438(ii)—X. of 1923. The above three individuals are actually in the Shaikh’s employ. The following are influential notables :— Saiyii Hamid Bey av-Kaqib, a son of the late Naqib of Basrah and brother of the famous Saiyid Talib Pasha. He lives p *rtly in Basrah and partly in Kuwait, and owns property in both plac‘s. Unlike his brother he does not go in for politics, and, despite his high birth, he does not dispise business. To him belongs the credit of m king the motor road from Kuwait to Zubair, and of farming the Knwait-Iraq Motor Trans port Comp uiy. He is also the Ford agent in Kuwait. He is a well educated man, with charming manner =, and I an sure that what influence he has is for good. Bfilal al-Mutairi is the leading pearl merchant of Kuw it. Born and brought up in the desert with his tribe, he was fortunate at pearl diving when a young man, settled in the town, and is nnw by f ir the richest man in the place. He is still a Bedouin at heart : he has a very fine house, but 1 do not believe there is a chair in it—his reception rooms being furnished with rich carpets, cushions and camel-saddles alone. At the time of the recent “ revival ” when the Mutair became Ikhwan, he wavered for some time as to whether to join the movement himself or not, and got so far as to discard his head-rope and bind his kerchief with a turban instead (the outward emblem of the Iklman). He soon made up his mind, however, and went hick to the head-rope. Still, he is very strict, and strongly disapproves of smoking, etc. He has never lost touch with his tribe, and no Mutaiii ever tomes to Kuwait with out go ng to his house. He is consequently very well informed regarding the desert. He is an elderly man and his views are somewhat old fashioned, hut on the whole his influence is for good. Shamlan al-Ali is the second largest pearl merchant in Kuwait, and is closely associated with Hilal al-Mutain. Like him he has great influence. He took a very strong line in opposing Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim’s Customs scheme in June 1923f—in fact, but for him it is probable that Shaikh Abdullah would have got his way, and Shaikh Ahmad been forced to agree to Ibn Sa’ud’s terms. Hamad bin Abdullah as-Saqar owns the biggest bo rt-building establishment in Kuwait, and has also interests in Iraq—in fact for the last year or two he has spent much more of his time there than in Kuwait. He had a very bitter hatred against the late Shaikh Salim on account of the needless wars he had inflicted upon Kuwait, and I think it is quite probable that he would have brought about a revolution before long if Shaikh Salim had not died when he did—he had already sounded the Political Agent as to the possibility petitioning Government to depose him. It was Ham id as-Saqar who championed the proposal that the people would not tolerate another absolute Ruler ; and he was president of the Council which was elected at the beginnig of Shaikh Ahmad's rule—hut which never functioned fSub-enclo. to Erclo. to Serial No. 7 in file No. 438(ii;— X. of 1923.4 Hamad al-Khalid is a dour, butkindly, old man of old-fashioned views. During the War he started to lead the Pro-Turk party—until Shaikh Mubarak made it clear that there was to be no Pro-Turk Party in Kuwait. There is now nothing anti-British about him. Shaikh Yusuf bin ’Isa is a schoolma-ter and intriguer who is mixed up with every underhand plot in Kuwait. There are of course many others who are in a position lo influence the Shaikh but the above are the most important. Twm other men, not Kuwait subjects, whose characters are worth considering are 'Abdullah an-Nafisi and Shaikh Hafidh Wahbah. 3 Abdullah an-Nafsi is Ibn Sa'ud's Agent in Kuwait. He is a pleasant and tactful man, who is liked by everyone in the place. Though Agent to the Wahhabi King, he is one of the heaviest smokers I have seen. Shaikh [or Mulla) Hafidh Wahbah is an Egyptian who has been in Ibn Sa’ud's service for the last few years. He has the reputation of being rabidly anti-British, and is said to have been deported from 'Iraq during the War—though I do not remember his case myself—and was deported from Bahrain in 1922.* Personally I think that his reputation is largely, if not entirely, unearned; and that he was really much more anti-Daly than anti-British—he certainly did dislike Major Daly, and probably said so in Bahrain. I was naturally very suspicious of him when he came here, and watched him carefully, but have never heard of him saying or doing anything in the slightest degree anti-British. He is a well educated man but does not give the impression of being in any way brilliant. Ibn Sa'ud is not well off for educated men, and, with the exception of Dr. 'Abdullah Effendi Damluji, I think Shaikh Hafidh is about the best I have met. The Town of Kuwait now measures about three miles along the shore, having extended consider ably in recent years towards the east. Its greatest depth, about one mile, is near the centre of the town, where the long suburb called Murqab has grown out from it towards the south-east. The streets are irregular and winding, and the town is not laid out on any general plan. Most of the houses have only a ground floor, but appear higher, owing to a parapet-wall enclosing the roof. There are over forty mosques, of which nine are Friday congregational mosques. None of them have any architectural merit. In the year 1920 the existing Town Wall was built by the late Shaikh Salim. It is a little over four miles in length, and has three gates. In addition to the gates, which are protected by towers, there is a tower about every two hundered yards throughout the length of the wall. The Inhabitants are for the most part Arabs of the 'Utub, 'Awazim, Rashaidah, Bani Khalid, Dawasir, 'Ajman, 'Anizah and Dhafir tribes, besides Arabs from Hasa, etc. There are also a large number of Persians (mostly engaged in menial pursuits) and many negroes. The Jewish community numbers about 160 souls, and the Christians only a few families. Indians have * F. No. 480-X—23, never 'made good’ in Kuwait, and are much despised. There are only three or four in the town. The Population is believed to be somewhere in the neighbour of 50,000. Education. —There are a great number of schools of a sort in Kuwait. The Arabs conduct at leart fifty two ; the Persians have eleven, and the Jews and Christians one each, making a total of at least sixty five. Of the Aiab schoo* twenty seven are for boys and twenty five for girls. These schools are not under any control by the local Government. Most of the boys' schools and all the girls’ schools teach nothing but the reading of the Quran ; and up to the end of 1911 no higher form of education was available in the town. At present The American Mission School gives by far the best education in Kuwait, particularly as regards English, but it only has twenty boys— which is about all it can accommodate. Ihe Mubarakiyah School was established in 1912, about the same time as the Mission School A sum of Rs. 85,000 was collected by public subscription, of which Rs. 40,000 was used tc build a school, with many large class-rooms and verandahs r.»und a courtyard, and the balance kept as an endowment fund. It has a Board of Trustees in charge of its affairs. Its income is derived from the endowment and the fees for pupils, who pay Rs. 2 a month each. There is a headmaster and six assistant masters and about 220 boys, who are graded in classes. The curri culum includes the Quran, Traditions, canon law, ethics, Arabic reading, composition and grammar, arithmetic, geography, history and English. It is thus far advanced from the usual mulla school, but even so it does not pretend to give more than a primary education. The Ahmadiyah School was founded in the autumn of 1921 under the auspices of the Muslim Benevolent Association, wbh the ass stance ot the present Ruler, after whom it was named. It has its own Board of Trustees. Its income is derived from the fees of siudente-, supplemented by annual contributions from benevolent residents and it is therefore not on a very secure basis It has seven masters and 165 boys, and is carriculum is the same as that of the Mubarakiyab School, but it is planned to make it into a secondary school when—or if—they can get qualified masters at the salaries which they can afford to pay. The Orphanage School for orphans and other poor boys is supported entirely by one family of wealthy pearl merchants. It has six masters and about 130 boys, and teaches the usual Quranic branches, wdth history and arithmetic in addition. There are eight other schools for Arab boys which teach a little arithmetic, in addition to the reading of the Quran. Persian Schools which teach writing and arithmetic, in addition to the reading of the Quran, are three in number; while there are eight others which teach the last subject only. Agnculture. —In Kuwait and its environs is practically nil. There are no date plantations of any value, hardly any fields and not many kitchen gardens. The villages to the south-east of5 Kuwait, supply a limited but incvea-ing quantity of vegetables and melons. The chief agricultural centre in the principality is Jahrah, where wheat, barley and lucern are grown, as veil as vegetables, U'&gt;d where there are some 2 500 date palms. 'The agriculture of J hrah might be considerably increased if m re money were sunk in it. The next most important agricultural centre is the inland of Failakah, where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches, also vegetables, and particularly carrots, w’hich are of quite exceptionally fine qudi y The Sea Fisherit'.*. - Of Kuwait are its only truly local poduce; the&gt;e are a valuable asset, besides float-anil-v\ eight nets and lines, traps made of ree i hurdle-; are also used the tish enter them at the flowing tide and are left behind at the ebb. The majority of the fish caught is con sumed locally hut a sm 11 j roportion is dried and expox'ted to Pasrah and e'sewhem. The fisher men of Kuwait are mostly Arabs of the ‘ Awazim tribe, but there are also other Arabs and a few Persians. The boats used are practically all Shu' a is, the except!'ns being jalibauts. A few of the primative hu'&gt; airiyah*, or boats made of date branch's are still used. Pearl Fishing is the most important trade ‘f Kuwait. The town possesses over seven hundred pearl boats, but many of these have not been at sea for years, as owing to the increased demand for 1 hour elsewhere, it is impossible to find crews for them. The average number of boats from Kuwait which now visit the banks is not more than about 330, and this year it was veiy much smaller. The Kuwait Pearling Fleet consists of tw&lt;&gt; p.rts : the ^mall boats which fish off the Neutral Zone, Sudah and Huzum ; while the large boats go farther afield. The 1927 season w ns better than has been for three or four y ar, and the pearl market, which las been bad for some time is also better. Trade .—Kuwait owes its mercantile imporiance to its p‘ aiding and carrying fleets, and to its trade with India, and with Traq and Persia — especially a lucrative smuggling trade. Also in normal &gt;ears with the Interior of Arabia, par ticularly Qisim, for which it is the natural port. Since the beginningof 1922, however, this trade has been closed by Ibn Sa'ud, who has piohibited his subj cts from trading with Kuwait at all. His re ison for this action is that he says he is unable he collect his Customs dues on goods im- porte 1 from Kuwait in the dese t, and that he wants to establish a Najd Customs House in Kuwait Town, an arrangement which the Shaikh of Kuwait has naturally never seen his way to accept. Other suggestions have been made to get over the difficulty : for example that import duty into Najd should be abolished, and that the Si aikh of Kuwait should levy export duty instead and pay Ibn Sa ; ud a fixed sum, but up to th** present it has not been possible to come to any agreement. This stoppage of trade between Najd and Kuwait is a most serious matter for Kuwait—as also for Qasim and Hail—and the prosperity of the town has been declining ever since. The people of Kuwait are nearly all of Najd origin, andm-ta few of the Kuwait merchants had partners in Buraidah and Unaizah, and even n nv the affairs of Najd interest them much more than those of 'Iraq. Ibn Sa’ud.—-lL\ie great Wahhabi Ruler Faisal bin Turki as-Sa'ud who died in 1865 left his throne to his eldest son, 'Abdullah. The latter’s brother Sa'ud, however, rebelled against him and occupied Riyadh. 'Abdullah fled to Hail, and invoked the assistance of Ibn Rasbid, who was then the most powerful man in Arabia. Sa'ud was defeated and killed, but 'Adullah soon realized that he had gained little, as Ibn Rashid annexed the Wahhabi countrv, and 'Abdullah was kept a prisoner in Hail until he died. Meanwhile the remnants of the Sa'ud, who would not submit to a foreign yoke had gone into exile, some to ihe Hijaz, and others, including Faisi.l’s fourth son 'Abdur Rahman, to Kuwait. Encouraged and helped by Shaik Mubarak, another hitter enemy of Ibn Rashid, Abdur Rahman undertook the task of freeing his land from the foreigner. An attempt in 1900, failed, but in the spring of l9ul 'Abdul Aziz bin ’Abdur Rahman al-Fnisal as-Sa'ud, the present &lt;f Ibn Sa’ud ', acting for bis father, left Kuwait with a picked follow ing of two hundred m* n. When he armed near Riyadh, he halted his party and went on at dusk with ttfiem men alone They m de their way unnoticed to the bouse of Ibn Rashid’s governor, into which they forced an entry and placed eviry-one in it under arrest in one room. They learned that the governor, as alwavs had gone to the fort to pass the night for greater security. They accordingly waited in the house till he r&gt; turned in the moring sur rounded by this badvguard. As the cortege approached the dcor, the sixteen rushed out sword in hand, and, after a brief struggle 'Abdul 'Aziz found himsr If master of Riyadh. The following years wire spent in recovering pro vince after province from the dominion of the foreigner. In the spring of 1913'Abdul ’Aziz, in whose favour his father had abdicated, swooped upon Haf-a and turned the Turks out of the province lock, stock and barrel. Such was the state of affairs at the outbreak of the War—which affected Arabia Kss then most parts of the world. When Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait renounced fealty to the Turk he really changed nothing. When Ibn Rashid marched against Ibn Sa’ud at the close of 1914-, although nominally he did so on behalf of the Turks, it was really only another hand in the old match between the rival principalities of Riyadh and Hail. The rival forces met at Majma’ah, 120 miles north-west or Riyadh, and fought an indecisive battle, in which Captain Shakespeare who was with Ibn Sa'ud was killed. It was not till the beginning of November I9'2l, however, that the long struggle was finallv bvoug'ht to a close by the final surrender of Hail to Ibn Sa’ud. This brought not only the Jabal Shammar, but Jauf and all the surrounding country to the borders of Syna, under his sway. Ibn Sa'ud’s next campaign against the Hijaz started in the summer of lvu24, the result of a quarrel which had long been simm ring By the end of 1925 he had captured the Hijaz' and expelled the Hasbimite dynasty. Thus in twenty- five years did this extraordinary man raise himself from an exile in Kuwait to be King of the Hijaz and of Najd and its Dependencies. Ibn Sa'ud is now a man of about fifty years of age. He is at least 6 feet 3 in. in height, and of very dign fied and handsome appearance. He possesses an extraordinary charm of6 manner such as I h ive rarely seen in any man of any race. Abdullah bin Jiluwi, Ibn Sa’ucPs cousin, is certainly the second most important man of the Sa ud family. He was one of the faithful lotml who ajcompanied Ibn Sa^ud on the desperate venture which restored the throne of Riyadh to his family, and has ever since erjoyed and merited his unbounded confidence. He was app'infed Governor of Qa.-i n on the reconquest of that province from Ibn R shid, and in 1914 was order ed to Hasa to create order out of tlie confusion left by the Turks, which he soo r » did. In fa&lt; t before long he had made himself indisp nsilde there but for which fact, he would much prefer to lead a quiet life at home, as he is said to be absolutely un imbit ous. Several years older than Ibn S;i/ud, he is said to be a man of medium height and medium build, somewhat morose in appearance. He has eumed an extraordinary reputation for justice. or f Brethren \ is the name assumed by the fanatical W ahhabi converts after the recent revival. It is not quite certain when this ^ re vival ’ first started, but the term “ Ikhwan ” first came into general use about the beginning of the W ar. It was then that Ibn Sa’ud decided to turn his attention to it as a me ms of strengthening and consolidating his power. The story goes that Ibn Jiluwi warned him against it and said ' they would certainly make a useful weapon, but I fear that they may be like an automatic pistol which certainly fires fast, but with which there is a danger that when you put it in your belt it may go off and wound you v . To this Ibn Sahid is said to have replied : “ Don’t be frightened of that, when I’ve done with my pistol, I’ll unload it and throw the cartridges on the ground ”. He did realise however that it was vital to get the members of the new cult under control. In 1918 he issued his fam. us order that ad Bedouins of Najd must join the mov- ment. This led to much fighting, but by 1918 he had forced all except the ’ Ajman to do so, and to recognize him as their Imam. In order to keep these tribes under his control, he induced his religious leaders to issue a faticah that the Ikhwan should build themselves villages and till the soil, this be ; ng incumbent on them from a religious point of view. The order seems to have been responded to with enthusiasm in most cases. The progress of the movement was m st cleverly managed, and Ibn Sa’ud showed great genius in working out the scheme without estranging the people. He him self selected the site for &lt;ach Ikhw r an village. With a tribe which was no^ of itself keen to join the movement his method seems to have been to send for the Shaikh and tell him in blunt terms that his tribe had no religion. He would then order the Shaikh to attend a course of instruction at a school of Religion. At the same time half a dozen selected instructors, attended by some genuine fanatic like Fnisal ad-Dawish, would be sent off to the tribe. These would hold daily classes, and it rarely took them long to rouse the dormant fanaticism inherent in simple and savage people. These teachers insisted on all converts wearing a white turban over the kerchief in place of the head-rope (Ibn Sa’ud has since decreed that this is not necessary, and he himself always wears the head-rope'. The strictest puritanism is the key-note of their religion, and the use of tobacco is regarded by them as deadly a sin as the drink ing of alcohol. They themstdves a e all Brethren, but like all new converts to any religion they are very intolerant. They will n-t even salute, or return the salute of, anyone outside the'r own sect, or even allow that he is a Muslim. I re- member Sh ikh Salim having one flogged f r swaggering up to a shop-keeper in Kuwait and saying as he pointed to some of his wares” ‘ Ala cham, ya chdfir ? How much is it, infidel ?). Of the tribes most closely associated with Kuwait the most important are :— The Mutmr, a large tribe said to be of Hijaz origin, and closely akin to the Harb and the ’Utaibah. Un il they became Ikhwan the Mutair w^re one of the most typical Bedouin tribes of Central Arabia, with a range from near Kuwait town in the north, westward to the Batin, to Qasim and the northern part of Hasa in the south. Since theirconversion ” however, the major ty of them have settled, notably at Artawiyah(250 miles south,, south-west of Kuwait, and 150 miles north, north west of Riyadh), which is one of the most famous Ikhwan villages in Arabia, and the seat of the most powerful Shaikh of the tribe, the fanatical Faisal ad-Dawish. Another of their villages is Jaryah (125 miles south of Kuwait) the seat of Ibn Shuqair, the building of which in 1920 was one of the causes of the quarrel between Ibn Sa’ud and Shaikh Sabm. The original sections of the Mutair are only tw r o, the ’ilwah and the Buraih. But to these have been added in recent times, probably by a fission from the Buraih, a third section, the Bani ’Abdallah. During the struggle for supremacy at the beginning of the century the Bani ’Abdallah sided with Ibn Rashid while the major ity of the tribe w&lt; re partisans of Ibn Sa’ud. After the defeat of Ibn Rashid they rejoin'd the main body of the Mutair, but the reci heiliation was only temporary, and they have separated themselves again, and left the tribe for the country betw r eeu Najd and Mecca. The ’Hwali consist of two sub-sections, the Muwahah, which is Faisal a l-Dawish’s own sub section, and of which the other chief Shaikhs are Jufran al-Fuqm, Haif al-Fuqm and Ihn Ghunaiman ; and the Jiblan, of which the chief sh ikhs are Faisal bin Shiblan and Saihud bin Land. The Burnil are composed of three main sub sections, the Aulad Ali, the Aulad Wasil and the Birzan, all of which are under the leadership of Ibn Musaivis of the Aulad Wasil. To the Birzan he ong the notorious family of Abu Shuwairibat, the members of which emsed so much trouble to the peace of the frontier a few' years ago. The Mutair have suffered heavily in the recent wars, particularly at the battle of Jahnh in October 1920, and in the fighting outside Hail in September 1921, and it is probable that the total strength ot the tribe does not now exceed 9,000' souls. Faisal ad-Dawish’s authority as paramount Shaikh of the Mutair has been much consolidated by the change of religion. The tube, as is also the case with other Ikhwan tribes, is not now well armed.The ’Ajni'in, usually pronounced 'Aiman—the Singular of which is 'Ajmi (Aimi)—are one of the most important tribes of Eastern Arabia. Their proper summer range is the Gulf lowlands from laff to ^Lqair ( Ujair) enveloping the Hasa oasis on the north and east. Inland their count- ary stretches back ov^r the Summan, and in winter as f&gt;r as Sudair. On the littoral they have sometimes straggled into Qatar, and fre quently to, and beyond, Kuwait town. Some fettled 'Ajman, detached fr &gt;m the tribe, have for many years be n found in Kuwait town, and in the coastal villages to the south of it. The tribe is a strong one, although their claim to be able to turn out over 10,000 fighting men, including 2,000 horsemen, is probably exaggerated ; yet there is little doubt that they number over 80,000 souls. In polities they have always been a shift ing ard inconstant factor. During the Ottoman occupation of Hast and Qdif they were constant ly recalcitrant. Th^y welcomed I bn Sa ud when he invaded Hasa in 1918, hut, once he was established, liked him and his taxes no better than the Turks. In 1915 he organized a cam paign against them but was defeated in an abortive night attack, and his own brother, SaM, was killed. Later on, with the assistance of a Kuwait force under Shaikh Salim, he hemmed them in near the Qat f coast. After being besieged for some time the ’Ajman surrendered to Shaikh Salim, who sent them to Kuwait, where Shaikh Alubarak accepted them, aginst Ibn Sadd's wishes, who wished to further avenge his brother’s death. Soon after this Shaikh Mubarak died, and Shaikh Jabir, in order to placate Ibn Sa’ud, ejected tbe' , Ajman from Kuwait territory. After making overtures first to ’Ujaimi as-Sadun and then to Ibn Rashid, thev obtained permission from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly at Safwan. On the occasion of Ibn Sa’ucTs visit to Kuwait and Basrah in November 1916 a truce was arranged between him and the ’Ajman. In the middle of 1917 however Ibn Sa’ud induced the Awazim to leave Kuwait ter it ry and settle in Najd. Shaikh Salim, who was then Ruler, retali ated by seducing the ’Ajman, who moved en mas*e into Kuwait territory Eventually after much corresp ndence, Ibn Sa’ud agreed to restore the Awazim if Shaikh Salim would turn out the ’Ajman and cut off his relations with the Shammar. The Awazim were returned, but the 'Ajman remained in Kuwait territ ry. By the beginning of TUS the question had become such a burning one that it was decided to take the tribe under British protection, and they were settled to the north of Zubair. Here they were guilty of so much raid ing that Ibn Sa’ud way eventually told that, so far as the British were concerned, there was no objection to his taking action against them. About a year later the Ajman again acknowledged their allegiance to Ibn Sa’ud and returned to Najd. Since then they have become Ikhwan. The paramount chieftainship of the ’Ajman is in the Hithlain family of the Naji’ah sub-section of the Mai’dh section of the tribe, the present holder being Dhaidan al-Hithlain. His head quarters is at Sarar (165 miles south of Kuwait). The chLf sections of the tribe are the Arjah under Saikh Mani bin’ Jum'ah ; the Dha’in, under Shaikh Fahad bin Sa’d ; the Hadi, under Shaikh Nahar al-Mutalaqqim (recently in ’Iraq) ; the Hajraf, the Hajjan, the Hamad bin Rashid and the Hithlain, all under Nahar al-Mufalaqqim; the Khuwaitir; the Mahfudh, under Mabkhut al- Muqrad ; the Maidh, the Miflih, the Misra, the Rushaid and the Sulaifi, under Dhaidan al- Hithla n himself; the Shamir under Sultan bin Hithalain; the Shawawilah, under Fahad bin Hithlain ; the S if ran, under Mansur bin Shafi al-Munaikh; the Sulaiman, under Muhammad bin Muse mi; and the Suraib. The Awazim (singular Azimi) are a Bedouin tribe of the country to the south of Kuwait. About 250 non-nomadic families of the tribe are settled in Kuwait town, where one of the quarters is called after them; others possess the village of Dimnah to the west of Ras al-Ardh ; and a few more live on Maskhan island, or Mascban as it is always called. The tribe has no connection with another tribe of Awazim or Hawazira found in Central Arabia, especially near Jauf. These Awazim, who claim to be of Harb origin, appa rently first made their appearance in the ne : gh- bouvhood of Kuwait daring the early part of the 19th Century. They are divided into two main sections, the Kuah and the Ghiyadh, of which the former takes precedence. Their paramount shaikh is Habib bin Jami of the Hadalin sub section of the Kuah. The tribe numbers about T OO! 1 souls. They are pastoral nomads, fishermen and pearl divers. They are large breeders of camels, sheep and goats, also a fair number of donkeys, but few horses. In Kuwait town the fishing trade is mostly in their hands. The Awazim are recognised as an inferior tribe and intermarry only amongst themselves and with the Rashaidah. For many years the Awazim were the loyal subjects of Kuwait, and from a military point of view formed the backbone of Ibn Subahs state. During the rule of Sha kh Salim the ques tion of their tribute was one of the chief causes of his quarrel with Dm Sa’ud. The nomads of the tribe have now become Ikhwan, and have natu rally oriented themselves towards Ibn Sa’ud. The Rath a id h (singular Rashidi) are an inferior tribe of Kuwait and the territory to the south of it. They number about 4,000 souls and are said to be of Hutaim extraction; those in Kuw r ait town, who are largely of tlm Hirshan section, are not unfrequeutly called Hutaim — a term which is also applied to the Saluba, those despised tinker outcasts who are found all over Arabia. A few years ago the majority of the nomadic Rashaidah became Ikbwan. The chief shaikhs of the tribe at present are Mutlaq al- Musailim (whom I last heard of in. Laq) and Asi al-Musadim (who is with the Ikhwan). There are seventeen sections to the tribe, but no useful purpose is served by enumerating them. The Dhafir is an Iraq tribe of Bedouins whose winter habitation is the country to the south of the railway line between Zubair and Nasiriyah. In the summer they are mostly on the Umm al-Afur island, opposite Samawah. They have for some time been flirting with Ibhwanism. The Muntafik .— Or “ Muntafiq ” as the name is officially spelt in English in ’Iiaq, though I have never heirJ it pronounced that xvay, or spelt that way in Arabic—are a very large ‘ Iraq tribe, of which a portion are still Bedouin. We are only concerned with them here in that, amongst other places, they are found in the ’western deserton the right bank of the Euphrates—chiefly between Nasiriyah and Sam&amp;wah. The Shammar .—Who used to be of such vital importance in the politics of Central and Eastern Arabia, have more or less f‘ded out of the picture. Formerly the Southern Shammar were not only a powerful nomad tribe, but also masters of the oasis of Jabal Shammar. Their paramount Shaikh, Ibn Rashid, was not only chief of his own tribe, but wa' also ruler of a settled princi pality, of which Hail was the capital. Since the fall of Hail in 1921, however, they have fallen from their high estate, and have largely joined the Northern section of the tribe. Recent events in the Desert .—In 19£3 a tendency began to be noticeable amongst Najd tribes to take refuge in Hrdq fr&gt; m the exactions of Ibn Sa’ud. These even included some families from the most rabidly Ikhwan tribes like the Mutair—notably the Divahin, a sect of the Aulad Wasil sub-section Buraik section of that tribe. These refugees soon started raiding into Najd, at the direct instigation of King Faisal according to the popular belief in Najd, and made the state of the country more disturbed than it had been for years. The Kuwait Conference between Najd and Hr&amp;q and Trans-Jordania was watched with intense interest to see whether •'Iraq would agree to Ibn Sa’ud ; s demand that such refugees tribes should be compelled to return. Big raids into, and from, Najd continued to take place in rapid succession until May 19£5 when, under orders from the Hr&amp;q Government, these seceders from the Ikhwan tribes of Najd, who had taken refuge in Hraq and had disturbed the peace of the frontier for so long, started to move towards the Northern Jazirah. By the end of Jun^ 1925 the country was free from them, and an immediate improvement in the state of the countiy followed. A long spell of quiet and more or less immunity from raids followed—doubtless due in part to the fact that the Ikhwan tribes were otherwise engaged, the Hijaz campa gn being then in progress. S~on after the fall of Jidilah at the end of 1925 many of the Ikhwan leaders returned to Najd. Some were bitterly disappointed th .t the Hijaz campaign had m t offered better facilities for amassing plunder. Notable amongst these was Faisal ad-Diwish. No sooner Lad he arrived at Artawijah than he summoned his followers to prepare Bra big raid against 'Iraq. Before he had time to set out, however, be received definite orders from Ibn Sa'ud forbidding him to proceed, and reluctantly disbanded his men. In April he visited Sultan bin Humaid, paramount shaikh of the 'Utaibah, at Ghatghat. From there an invitation was sent to Dhaidan al-Hithlain of ihe 'Ajman, who joined them shortly afterwards. They then apparently took an oath binding them selves together for mutu •! support in the event of Ibn Sa'ud -wishing to take punitive action against any of them. There continued to be much talk about the strained relations between Ibn Sa'ud and the leaders of the Ikhwan, par ticularly the three mentioned above, who were much dissatisfied with Ibn Sa'ud's idea of organiz ing a civilized government in the Hijaz, and his prohibiting them from raiding across the frontier. They argued that if as they maintained, the people of Hraq, Kuwait, etc., were not true Muslims, they ought to be allowed to fiMi against them; if, on the other hand, Ibn Sa nd prohibited this, saying that they were not enemies, he had no right to prevent them from trading In the summer of 1927 a plot to murder Ibn Sa'uFs son, Sa'ud, in Riyadh, and his cousin Ibn Jiluwi at Hasa, at the same time, was dis covered and frustrated only just in time. In the early part of 1927, on the Persian Government refusing ptrmission for the Imperial Airways to establish a service to India along the south coast of Persia, the suggestion was made that the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf might be followed instead, and Ibn Sa'ud was approached with a view to obtaining his permission for the route over his territory to be used. As was to be expected, the very idea of such a thing was anathema to the Ikhwan, and Ibn Sa ud on the very strong advice of Ibn Jiluwi said that he could not agree. Next came the building of a Police Post at Baswah * or Busaiyah, as we usua'ly call it. The Ikhwan apparently connect it in their minds with the Air Route scheme, and think that it is destined to become an enormous petrol dump—hence their determination to destroy it. The Air Route scheme and Busai yah Post between them certaii.ly seem to be the immediate causes, or, perhaps it would be better to say, the immediate excuses, of Faisal ad- Dawish and his Mutair getting out of hand, and going raiding in defiance of Ibn Sa'ud s orders. The real reason is that they, like all Bed'uins, are parasites who do not earn their living in the world, and must be paid, or raid. The actual attack on Busaiyah Post, the raid on the Kuwait 'Uraibdar, or local Bedouin, eta are too recent to require re apitul ting. At present the situation seems to be that Faisal ad-Dawish, as stated above, is acting in open defiance of Ibn Sa'ud. The 'Ajman and other tiibes aie quiet at present, but are not a very reliable weapon in Ibn Sa'ud's hands. Ibn Sa'ud is c rtainly in a very awkward position ; ho is obviously having very strong pressure brought to bear on him, as it is hard to think that a man of his acumen can really think all that he has been writing in his recent letters of protest. It remains to be seen whether In 3 will be able to bring Dawdsh to heel at.d re-establish his authority, or nut. Personally I think he will do so through the Ulama, whom he has summoned to Riyadh. He has a very persuasive tongue, and they have great influence with the tribes, if he can make them see reason. Meanwhile, as far as Kuwait is concerned, the people are still in a state of nervous tension. The town wall has been repaired, and is manned every night. The village of Jahrah is also strongly held with a force of over three hundred men, including a body of specially engaged mercenaries, but not counting the Bedouin camped in the vicinity. Many alarmist rumours are current, and accurate new T s is at a discount. * File No. 475-N. 890 F&amp;PD.w 1l/ In any further commumcatiou on this subject, please quote No. and address- not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretarj of State/’ Foreign Otiice, London, S.W. 1. v rf-t- ^ i I - v~ 368 ? 1924 H THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his and, by direction of the Secretary of State, compliments to f . transmits herewith cop^ of the under-mentioned paner. 0 i (H—■ •&gt; Ho. 971.

Tl&amp;zt-ztC • „ o^.-rstsury Cl StatsMinute The Colonial Office have made a complete volte face on the subject of the conduct of relations with Ibn Saud. Up to the present they have been pressing for the direct conduct of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud through the Political Agent, Bahrein, the Resident at Eushire being eliminated from the chain of authority. Although fully aware of the administrative inconveniences likely to be caused by the proposed arrangement this Department has supported the Colonial Office* view because it seemed desirable not to allow questions of administrative convenience to block an arrangement whereby, without any sacrifice of principle cm *our part, a concession that appeals with peculiar force to the Oriental mind could be made. The Colonial Office appeared convinced that the concession was indubitably necessary to appease Ibn Baud’s amour propre. They have now withdrawn from this position, and as they are the department responsible for the conduct of relations with Ibn Saud, it is not for this department to adhere to a position they have abandoned. In a recent letter’(P.413 below) the Resident at Bushire adduces arguments against the Colonial Office’s original proposal. His arguments are susceptible of reply, Ho. 1 in particular, ignoring the historical change in Ibn Baud’s position, but no useful purpose would be served now by criticising them* The Colonial Office proposals now put forward refer to^koweit as well as to Nejd and are strictly in accordance with the recommendations of the Mastert on-Smith Committee. They may be accepted without • « reference to India. A caveat regarding the financial effect of the proposals has been included in the draft letter.

In view of the considerations advanced by the Government of India and by Sir P.

No.C.0./37 nr 4 — My Lord Luke, I have the honour to report that during my reoent tour in the Persian Gulf I visited Kuwait t and discussed various matters with the Shaikh and the Political Agent - among others the question of his future relations with us and the medium through which tl^qy could most conveniently he conducted, having regard to the .transfer of government in ’Iraq from the British Administration to a national Government. Shaikh Ahmad the present Ruler is an amiable and tractable person who finds difficulty in expressing any definite views on any important subject, but the conclusion we came to in discussion was that on the whole it would be rather for the interests of Kuwait in the future that her relations should be conducted with the Bushi re Residency than with the High Commissioner in Baghdad: the factbeing that l Kuwait affairs in general connect rather with the Gulf Porte and Bombay than with ’Iraq andjthe Resident will consequently have more inducement to maintain close touch with Kuwait and solicitude for her interests than the High Commissioner at Baghdad. In view of the trend of opinion above explained, I informed Colonel Trevor and Sir A.T. Wilson, whom I saw later that subject to the intimation of ary different view on the part of His Majesty’s Government, I did not propose to deal with the question of the Anglo Persian Oil Company’s negotiations for an Oil Concession in Kuwait territory and thought they had better be handled by Colonel Trevor as Resident.
