The soldier (intruder) was taken over by the Military on the 31st August 1937. 2. As a result of the scuffle with the soldier intruder Murad ML i-our He ad-watchman and No or Mohamed a Watchman have been unfit for duty for over a week the former suffered from bruised ribs and the latter from an attack of Asthama (He had suffered from this disorder several years ago). 3o The Commanding Officer of the Regiment sentenced tue soldier (Caxar) oo 100 lashe s per day on three days. This sentence was duly carried out in front of the Regimenu on parade. The latrine has been demolished and the Commanding Officer has shewn good will by his prompt action. 4. The Trade Assistant was present in the lines of the Regiment at tnat time as a witness that the punishment had been duly inflicted. The Commanding Officer specially requested that tnis fact should not be reported to any Iranian Department. I recommend that this request should be granted. 2° H® expressed a desire that this case should not be reported to higher authority as the \fer Ministry at Tehran may visit its high displeasure on him.

Sir, I have the honour to report a somewhat disturbsing incident. On the night of 30th-31st August about - 1.30 the handle of my bed room doer. The door was bolted (Marked C in the sketch attached). I th^i heard atealthy sounds in the little office the window of which leading into the bed room was wide open, (Marked D in Sketch). I then saw that some things placed in the open window were being removed in order that the intruder could enter the bed room silently without upsetting these things. A lamp turned low was burning dimly near my bed and placed so as to cast a little light towards this open window (D). ^ similar^light was burning near my wife’s bed. f intruders so I challenged and heard the sound of - one Loan moving towards the sitting room. I fired my revolver ( which for some months I have made a habit of keeping in rny bed) at the shadow in the window where I thought I saw the head of a second man. There was no one there. I slipped out of bed, unbolted my bed room door (C on sketch) and the door on to the garden verandah and ran out to intercept the intruder who I found crouching behind the door of the closed veran dah (G). He was an Iranian soldier and as he appeared to be night- 2 . From the sounds I judged that there might be two unarmedunarmed I did not wish to have to shoot him. I warned him to keen back but as I blocked his way of escape he came near er me and as I sate had a revolver in one hand and a torch in the other I was obliged to kick him in the stomach. 3. I shouted for the night watchman who arrived and we marched the soldier to the front of the house in order to secure him in the guard room. The Head-watchman then arrived. As the soldier was beginning to recover from my kick and appeared to be about to attempt an escape I or dered the watchmen to tie him up. He resisted violently and was secured with great difficulty. He shouted that as he was a soldier we dared not lay hands on him and during the struggle he yelled 'Nizami* ^Nizami' hoping that other sol diers (possibly waiting accomplices) would come and rescue him. It was necessary to hit him hard to silence him and to gag him with his puttee as I did not wish to be involved in a brawl with a rescue party of soldiery.I then sent for the Trade Assistaat and the Rebate Officer and sent them to the town to inform the Civil Police, the Military Police, G-overnor and the Officer Commanding Troops. A Police Officer, a detective and the officer in charge Military Police arrived about 4 A.M. and interrogated the prisoner who gave the name of Safar son of Ibrahim Dildar of Turbat, Regiment No. 4 Company No. 3. The prisoner had explained to me that he was a recruit, did not know his way about and was taking a short cut through the Consulate to the town to buy ciga rettes. To the detective, however, he explained that he was passing along in front of the Consulate when he was suddenly set upon and tied up for no reason. 4. The detective, however, found the footprints of the prisoner leading from the barracks to the Vice Consu late verandah. It appears that he had scaled the wall on the Military side which was easy as a latrine had been built against......against it (I have requested the Officer Commanding Troops to have it removed as the wall was built and is maintained by this Vice Consulate). 5. No weapon was found on the person of the intruder nor have I been able to find any weapon abandoned by him when he fled. He held in his hands, however, his Givehs or country shoes with heavy iron heels which he might have hoped to use as a weapon. 6. The disturbing point about this incident is that the intruder’s objective was my bed room. Two lights were burn ing low in it so that from the verandah window (A on sketch) he could easily have surveyed the interior of our bed room. He entered the sitting room by prising open the wire netted window and the way to the dining room, pantry, store room and kitchen was then open to him so he could have stolen many desirable things there and escaped with ease. He, however, was evidently not content with such easy booty as the small clock in the sitting room, the carpets large and small, the curtains a large silver vase etc; The dining room with its cutlery etc. was also open to him but he evidently was not interested in such things. He did not attempt to enter the dressing room (F in the Sketch). He wished to enter the bed room only. He tried my bed room door (C) and finding that bolted went round to the side window in the little office (8 in tks sketch) and cleared away several tilings which obstructed his entry into the bed robm. If the object of his visit was theft it seems strange that he should not have taken anythin from trie sitting room (except a very small tin box of no value which was afterwards found in his pocket). 7. As I have not found any lethal weapon the theory of attempted murder is not clear but as he was a powerfully built man perhaps his heavy iron heeled shoies ( a popular IranianIranian weapon) would suffice against a sleeping man. The foreigner in t.ds country lias been so denounced by the Iranian G-overnment even in their training manuals that, to a private soldier the foreigner must appear as a veritable public enemy No. 1 and his killing no murder. 8. The intruder’s barracks were those most distant from the Vice Consulate and to reach the Vice Consulate he would have to come several hundred yards through the lines of his Regiment. This fact reflects very unfavourably on the line discipline, guarding and policing within the Regiment. 9. I am of the opinion that this man must have in tended to murder me by some method or other either for some reward offered to him or in the hope of finding money under my bed. The Police are powerless in a kss case where a soldier is the offender so I recommend that our Legation be requested to demand a proper inquiry.

Consul-General, Meshed, dated 22nd August, which is now submitted, gives rather a disquieting picture of the insecurity on the roads in East Persia at the present time. Colonel Daly may be unduly alarmist; but the Hart case, to which the file refers, shows that travellers may be exposed to considerable danger in this part of the world. It appears from H.M.Minister’s telegram No.172 that the Persian Government are alive to the importance of the matter and are taking some steps to attempt to deal with it.

The postal lorry was subjected to rifle fire about one month ago and there have been other cases. On the 15th August a party of seven bandits held up all traffic on the road from about 9am. till sunset, in allt one touring oari two motor uuseSf six lorries# and oazael and donkey caravans were held up and the passengers looted. One Iranian was killed and two wounded. Among the passengers robbed of all effects, including clothing, was Ur katrailer, a British Indian subject - member of a Missionary Society - with Headquarters at aahidan. Throughout the whole day no assistance was forthcoming. A solitary Hoad Guard, on foot, came upon the scene, and although he might have assumed that a -hold up* was taking place and could have reconnoitred from a distance and have brought help, he walked into the trap with his rifle slung on his shoulder, and was disarmed and robbed.

In the said paragraph it says; 'for which I as now Instructed to preaa.And also at the end of the said paragraph it saysi 'His Majesty's Government arc nevertheless prepared to agree that the payment of this sum to Mr. Hart ahall be regarded as finally closing the matter. I trust, therefore, that Your Excellency will see your way to effect a speedy solution by agreeing to this proposal...' The reason for the non-acceptance by my Govern ment of the above statements is that, as mentioned in the note No. 516 of Xhordad 8th, 1314 (May 30th, 1936) and confirmed in the course of the verbal negotiations each time, the assistance /whichwhloh was formerly extended to Mr. and Kre. Hart by the Imperial Government and which is being extended now waa only and only with a view to helping them without being under any obligation to do so and with the understanding that this should not be taken as a precedent for the future. Your Excellency will, no doubt, admit that similar incidents are taking place every day in the most organised (safest) countries in the world and that no Government can assume any responsibility for the losses incurred by their subjects or the subjects of foreign countries through action of third persons.

Mr. Hart, Vice-Consul at Meshed, and his party were attacked by brigands on November 18th last year (P.Z.7179/34). In the course of the attack Mrs. Hart was shot in the arm, a good k deal of property was stolen, the chauffeur was wounded; a cleaner subsequently died of his wounds. The Persian local authorities were scandalously dilatory and inefficient (P. Z.200/35), but the Persian Government behaved quite well and spontaneously offered compensation for loss of property. They subsequently paid £300 for loss of property and medical, etc., expenses. (P.Z.^^/35). Meanwhile His Majesty's Government claimed compensation also for the injuries/ 3330 1000 12.34injuries and shock suffered by Mrs. Hart, viz. £500, but the Persians refused to pay this - apparently to avoid creating a precedent. (P.Z.^^/35). It was then decided to concentrate on obtaining a lump sum to cover actual medical expenses caused by Mrs. Hart 1 s injury (P. Z.4792/35).

As will be seen from tho certificate Siren by Doctor Hoffman, a copy of which I hare the honour to enclose, it is evident that unless an operation is performed on Mrs. Kart in the near future, the results of the injury will almost oertainly be permanent. ?he necessary operation can only be performed by a specialist nerve-surgeon, and must be followed by a prolonged course of electrical treatment if the new wasted muscles are to recover. Being unfamiliar with conditions in England Doctor Hoffman is un&amp;blt to state the probable cost involved. An exact estimate of the total eventual cost is of course impos sible at this stage, but both Colonil pyper, Indian Medical service,(His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Zabul),and the Medical Adviser to this legation are a^eed that it will oertainly be in the neighbourhood of ££5o (two hundred and fifty pounds) and may well be considerably mere. 3. as this operation and treatment i tf e only prospect of a cure Mr.Vrn. Hart are forced to proceed to Kiigl&amp;ad in October next for the purpose* 4* Relying on the undertaking of the Iranian Government to refund the losses and expenses entailed by this unfortunate affair. His Majesty*s Government therefore now propose that the e stlnated cost of this operation and treatment, namely £B50 (two hundred and fifty pounds), be paid by the Iranian Government in final settlement of their liability* I would point out to Tour ^xoaxlenoy that this sum covers only the future medical expenses to be incur red by Mrs* Hart in England* Expenses in respect of the prolonged treatment received by that lady from J&gt;ootor offtoan have not been mentL oned since the latter is under contract to treat all patients from Kis Majesty* s conailate General at Meshed. Further the cost of r* iind Mrs. Kart*s journey to London which might legitimately have formed part of the claims, is not being included as the Government of India have agreed to pay their travelling expenses. jt will tiiere^ore be seen that no payment is being olaimea in r« a?M t of two ooneider- bla iteas 0 f expenditure, for which compensation might properly haw, been ox £&gt;ectedexpected in tiocopdanee with the under taking which Your xoellenoy was sc good as to give the Xlth ec ember last (Azar 20th t 131^). 6* A» Your Kxcellenoy will therefore see, this final ptqraent of £250 (two liuiidred and fifty pounds), for which 1 as now instructed to iress, represents only a portion of the expenses entailed upon Mr* and Mrs* Hart sines the date of nay meaorandua of February bth (Bahean 16th 1313) as a direct result of the incident. His Majesty*s OoTernment are neverthe less prepared to agree that the paywsnt of this sum to Mr. Hart shall be regarded as finally closing the natter* X trust therefore that four isxoellency will see your way to affect a speedy solution by agreeing to this proposal* I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to your i xcellenoy the assur ance of ay hipest consideration* (Signed) H.MjiCnatoliba 11-Hugessen.^No._ 2/8 British Legation, E.4353 Tehran, June 29 th f 19 35 l 10 .ll'L 1935 ; His Majesty's Representative presents his compliments to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith, copies of the documents mentioned in the subjoined Schedule, on the subject of question of compensation for Mrs.Hart on account of wound received when attacked by bandits in November 1934. Reference:- Tehran telegram; no. 217 and 218 of to-day. Despatch from H.M.Consul-General for Khorasan Lo. 92 of June 20th,1935 (with first enclosure only). A copy has been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 123).Copy. Confidential. Bo. 92. _ (3/10-B-2) Hi a Britannic Majesty's Consulate- General for KHorasan and Sistan. Meshed, 20th June 1935. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your Ho. 45 of June 3rd. The situation is as follows Mrs. Hart was treated for several months hy the Mission Doctor. As however the Doctor is under contract to treat patients from the Consulate and receives a monthly fee from Government for the same, no specific charge was made to Mr. Hart. Under the circumstances no claim was made. Had this arrangement not been in force, a large sum would undoubtedly have been claimed for medical expenses. Doctor Hoffman has given the enclosed certificate. He is unable to estimate costs in iSngland as he has no experience of charges, etcetera in London. Colonel Pyper, Indian Medical Service, has in the meantime examined Mrs.Hart and has stated (a) That no general practitioner can deal with the case t and that a nerve surgeon in London must be consulted. He f thinks it almost certain that an operation, which can only be carried out by a nerve surgeon-specialist, will be necessary. (b) If the operation should be successful, prolonged electrical treatment will then be necessary to revive the muscles of the hand which have to a great extent atrophied. (c) Should an^ operation not be successful, Mrs.Hart will suffer permanently practical loss of use of the right hand, which she cannot use at present. Colonel Pyper states that he considers that the medical expenses to be incurred in London will not amount to less H.M.Minister than etc., etc., eto., Tehran.than £225 and may he more* 2* As much more delay would result in the muscles atrophying to an extent from which they could not recover, Mr* Hart is compelled to take leave in October next to take Mrs.Hart to London for treatment. Mr* Hart is entitled to a Government passage for himself and Mrs.Hart, otherwise the expense of the journey would also have been a justifiable claim. In any case he did not desire to take leave this year, but for this unfortunate occurrence, and will be put to a good deal of expense at a time which is r i/V* most convenient for him* r 3. To sum up; the Iranian Government have escaped any claim (a) for several months medical treatment locally* (b) for the expenses of Mrs. Hart's journey to England for specialist treatment, and the claim of £225 for such treatment may quite likely not entirely cover expenses, and will certain ly not fully re-imburse Mr.Hart for expenses he will have to incur by going on leave at a time when he was financially not prepared to do so. 4. Mr. Hart’s receipts for the monies forwarded with your despatch Ho. 46 of June 7th, are enclosed herewith.

If I mention £500 Claim in asking for the £250 now proposed Persian Government will reply that instead of suggesting final settlement I am claiming half as much again.

I feel very strongly that the only chance of securing further payment is, as proposed in last paragraph of my telegram 205, by asking for sum down to cover expenses without suggesting possibility of indefinite and incalculable future demandsv Addressed to Foreign Office No* 225, repeated to ugessen (Tehran), th July, 1955o Ly, 1955.

I would, however, point out that the sterling cheque represents an overpayment of ten pounds, but that the currency cheque ia correct since the total of I ials eleven thousand, eight hundred and aeventy eight was latex* reduced by hiala one thousand four hundred owing to the action of the authorities st Meshed in moving the driver of turn car from the American to the shrine hospital and thus saving the sum in question in medical expenses.

I he.d there fore caused s list to be prepared giring full details, in addition His Majesty's Gorerument and the Gorernment of India felt strongly that Mrs. Kart, who was still suffering partial disability and aight even be affileted permanently as a result of her wound, was entitled to some compensation for her injury and in respeot of this I had been 1 m* trueted to inelude the additional sum of fire hundred pounds.

The Foreign Office agreed that compensation was properly payable to Mrs. Hart if she sustained permanent injury to her arm, and suggested £500 as a fair amount for this compensation.

Mr. Knatchbidl-Hugessen to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 17.) IJN amplification of my telegram No. 162 of the 20th November, and subse quent correspondence, I have the honour to transmit, herewith, a copy of a detailed report addressed by Major Hamber, secretary to His Majesty’s consulate- general at Meshed, to His Majesty’s consul-general on the subject of the hold-up of which Mr. and Mrs. Hart were victims. I also enclose a copy of a private letter from Major Hamber which gives some further details. 2. Since Major Hamber’s report was written it has been discovered that the wounded cleaner, who has subsequently died, claimed British nationality. He had contrived to exist in East Persia for two years without papers of any kind, but he gave the names of various relatives at Nushki and his claims are now being investigated by Colonel Daly. 3. There is no doubt that the local authorities were scandalously dilatory, and I am, therefore, addressing to the Persian Government the note of which ] enclose a copy. I have made no mention in this of a claim for compensation. Conditions in Persia have changed considerably since Lord Curzon’s despatch No. 378 of the 22nd August, 1923, was written and I do not feel able, without prior instructions from you, to base my attitude on paragraph 5 of that despatch. Furthermore, the provisions of chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions seem to preclude my entering a claim, though the last sentence of the first paragraph of Part II, paragraph 4, leaves a loophole. 4. There is. of course, some faint hope that the Persian Government may offer an ex gratia payment, and it is interesting that the Governor-General of Meshed should already have enquired the extent of Mr. Hart’s losses, but I am unable to feel too confident about this. 5. I have received no written expression of regret from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, nor anything beyond what was reported in Mr. Mallet’s telegram No. 164, and I have no doubt that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would gladly see the matter dropped. The note which I am now addressing to him may produce some result, but I shall be glad to learn whether I should press for compensation should his Excellency's reply prove (as is to be expected) to contain no suggestion of an ex gratia payment. 6. I shall be grateful if I may receive instructions on this point by telegraph. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s consul-general for Khorasan, at Zabul (No. 89), and to His Majesty’s vice-consul at Meshed (unnumbered). I HAVE the honour to submit the following report on the subject of an attack by brigands on Mr. and Mrs. Hart of this consulate and of the action taken after the event. Paragraphs 1-14 are taken from Mr. Hart personally. [290 r 1] B bir, Tehran, December 1, 1934. I have, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN. Enclosure 1. in No. 1. Secret.) Major Hamber to Lieutenant-Colonel Daly (Zabul). Meshed, November 21, 1934.On the 18th November, the following members of the consulate staff left for Zabul :— 1. Mr. Fazal Haq, clerk, with three servants in a lorry, about 9 a.m. Mr. and Mrs. Hart, with their small son aged 6, and two servants, in a hired car together with the owner, a chauffeur and a shagird, all Persians, “ A -.^- Followed shortly after Mr. Zia-ud-Din Ahmad (Indian attache) with his tami in another hired car. . 2. Mr. Hart’s car passed the lorry en route, and at about 2 p.m. reached a point about 12 miles short of Turbat-i-Haidari, 3 miles south of the amnieh post of Robat-i-Khami. This section of the road passes through a mountain system, being overlooked on all sides. . 3. As the car approached a bend in the road fire was opened upon it Irom close range from the hills on both sides of the road. One of the bullets struck a front tyre and brought the car to a standstill. Some men shouted to them to get out, and while they w T ere doing so fired on them again (about three shots). Mrs. Hart was hit in the right arm. the shagird, who was on the running board, was hit twice and the chauffeur once. One of Mr. Harts servants was also grazed. 4. Three men appeared wdth rifles and one boy about 17 years old with a stick—the party was made to put. up its hands and hand over its money. They were then made to take off all their clothes to their shirts and drawers. Mrs. Hart s coat only was removed. They were searched and all their possessions taken. The luggage was removed from the car and emptied on the road and everything of value taken. Mr. Hart was forced to open the box of cyphers which, owing to its weight, was thought by the brigands to contain money. On seeing it was only books they paid no further attention to it. The search continued for about half an hour, during which time another youth arrived and joined the party. The brigands stated that they were Baluchis and that there were twenty of them and that they were going to kill the men of the party and take Mrs. Hart off with them. The search party was covered by a man sitting about 50 yards away on a hillock with a rifle. During the search Mr. Hart was struck with the butt of a rifle and his servant and the others with a large stone to try and get more money out of them. The car was searched and the seats removed. 5. At this point the old man on the hill, who appeared to be directing operations, shouted out that a lorry was coming from Turbat. Making the Harts lie hidden behind the car under the charge of one armed man, the remainder went towards the lorry, which they held up and looted. They all came back again after this and started knocking everyone about and packed up the loot in blankets which they dumped near the old man. Three more lorries arrived and were looted in turn without any firing. The tactics of the brigands were extremely good, lorries being turned off the road into a small nala in the hills, where they could not be seen by any others approaching. After looting the passengers of each lorry, the search party returned on each occasion to the car to collect more stuff. 6. After the last lorry had been looted, one of the party who had formerly said that he was going to kill the men and abduct Mrs. Hart ordered her to go off into the hills, saying : “ I am going to take this woman for myself ”; she refused, and he caught hold of her hands; her gloves came off, and he saw her rings and watch, which he took. This man then asked when the post lorry was coming, for which he said they were waiting. 7. At this point other motors could be heard approaching from both directions, and the search party divided to meet them, leaving one man with the Harts. The lorry from the direction of Meshed contained Mr. Fazal Haq, referred to in paragraph 1, who, seeing that there were armed men in the hills, turned back in time to get away. On reaching the amnieh post at Robat-i-Khami, they found it was deserted—they therefore went on to Asadabad, 16 miles further towards Meshed. 8. From the direction of Meshed fire was opened from a long range, which passed over the party. The brigands became alarmed and cleared off into the hills, returning fire as they went. 9. A small Ford car appeared round the corner and stopped. The driver finally was persuaded to go through to warn the amnieh. The lorries followed,3 and Mr. Hart succeeded in putting his wife and son on one of them. Mr. Hart remained with the car to change the wheel, collect the cyphers and anything which had not been taken, and bring in wounded men who were lying in the road. 10 . While they were doing this, one gendarme of the amnieh and half a dozen villagers appeared. The gendarme stated that he had been warned by a .villager of the firing, and had himself fired eleven shots at the brigands. There seems no doubt that the brigands were uncertain of the number of amnieh who were firing at them, and had he not appeared on the scene things would have taken a still worse turn, since one Baluch seemed determined to take off Mrs. Hart. 11. Eventually Mr. Hart and his servants succeeded in bringing in the car with the wounded to the amnieh post of Robat-i-Khami. It was then dark, about 6 p.m., and there was not enough petrol to reach any garage. The gendarme returned with a few clothes he had collected from 'the hillside, which had apparently been left by the brigands when they retreated. He was accompanied by some villagers and another gendarme, who had turned up in the meantime. 12. The gendarme, Nasrulla, No. 609, acted well, and, in Mr. Hart’s opinion, his services should be brought to the notice of the authorities concerned. 13. No action to pursue the brigands was taken by the amnieh at any time, even on the following morning. 14. Mrs. Hart, who throughout displayed the greatest courage and self- control, arrived in Meshed about midnight with her small son. II .—Action taken on receipt of this Information in Meshed. When Mrs. Hart and her son arrived and described what had happened I took the following steps :— 1 . I called Dr. Agapiefi, being near at hand, and went with him to call for military assistance (Dr. Agapieff is the doctor to the troops and lives near the consulate). He called up the Chief of Staff, since it seemed probable that it would take some time to get hold of the Amir Lashkar, Sartip Iraj Khan, at night. He then went and attended to Mrs. Hart’s wound. 2 . I asked the Chief of Staff to give me four armed men as quickly as possible, two rifles, for myself and my chauffeur, and to arrange to send on a lorry with more troops and a dresser^ since there were known to be wounded. It should be taken into account that the only information then available was to the effect that {a) Mr. Hart had been left out on the road by the car, where the hold-up had taken place, 70 miles from Meshed, stripped of nearly all his clothes, with the Government cyphers; {b) that firing was still going on when Mrs. Hart left; {c) that there was no indication of the strength of the gang or of what was likely to happen. 3 . After endless delay, the Chief of Staff called upon the chief of the amnieh to give me some men; in the meanwhile, the Amir Lashkar turned up and promised to send a lorry along as soon as possible after me. I eventually got the men, four armed gendarmes, and two rifles, in time to leave Meshed at 3-30 a.m., i.e., three and a quarter hours after the Chief of Staff had been warned. Though it would have been the simplest thing in the world to have detailed four men from the amnieh headquarters, or, as far as that goes, from the garrison a delay of not more than half an hour should have been incurred—it seemed impossible for the Chief of Staff to act on his own initiative. 4 In my car were taken clothing, food, and a few medical requirements. 5 En route I questioned all tea houses and garages for news, and obtained various accounts from the lorries who had got away. The road was littered with deserted lorries. No one seemed to know where Mr. Hart was. I found Mr. Zia-ud-Din Ahmad at Asadabad, some miles short of Robat-i-Khami, where he had spent the night on account of his car breaking down, and had fortunately missed the hold-up. . _ . i/* • • v^i 6 I reached the amnieh post, Robat-i-Khami, befoie sumise, in a little over two hours from Meshed, i.e., in considerably less time than it took me to get hold of the four amnieh gendarmes. 1 found Mr. Hart and his party there with the wounded men. The last mentioned were both shot through the arms, one twice and the other once. The American Hospital now reports that they will both lose their arms, and perhaps one will not survive. Mrs. Hart’s wound appears to be not very serious. [290 r—1] B 27. After waiting for the military lorry and the dresser to arrive till noon, we decided to bring the wounded in ourselves. In my opinion, had the Amir Lashkar or the Rais-i-Amnieh taken steps to commandeer one or two lorries and sent them off with an armed detachment under an officer without delay, they could have arrived at the scene of the hold-up before dawn and stood an excellent chance of capturing the brigands, who, loaded with loot, could hardly^ have gone far by night in that broken country. 8. En route to Meshed, about 30 miles from Robat-i-Khami, we met the Rais-i-Amnieh and four men, at about 2 p.m., which was the sum total of assistance I received from the authorities. I he lorry with troops and dresser were never sent, though the Governor informed me that the Amii Lashkai had told him that he either had done so or intended to do so. 9. None of the amnieh showed any desire to reconnoitre the scene oi the hold-up at any time, or trace the raiding party. Four amnieh at Asadabad, 16 miles from Robat-i-Khami, though warned at about 8 p.m. of the incident, refused to leave their post, though there were plenty of lorries and cai s which could have taken them to the scene of the incident in half an hour. 10. The telegraph office closes down at night, so there was no means of warning the military detachment or amnieh of Turbat-i-Haidari, 12 miles from the scene of the raid, a state of affairs which hardly assists in dealing with an emergency. There was no telegraph or telephone communication between the a mined reac j ie(i ^gghed at 4 p.m., and took the wounded to the American Hospital. . , , . ^ , 12. The Governor sent for me about 6 p.m.. and expressed his regret, and stated that such raids were more or less “ act of God,” and that he did not think anyone was to blame, and that all steps had been taken to aiiest the gang. I have, &amp;c. L. W. HAMBER, Major, Secretary to Consul-General, Meshed. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Major Hamber to Lieutenant-Colonel Daly (Zabul). (No. 280. Secret.) Meshed, November 22, 1934. JUST a private line in amplification of the report I have sent in. I took upon myself the compilation of this report since I was the only person i n a position to know the full facts of the case other than Hart, who did not know the official side as regards the action, or rather inaction, on the part of the Persian authorities. It was a bad show altogether and the Harts are naturally pretty badly shaken, and in my opinion all came out of it very luckily. Mrs. Hart and Kieth were extremely brave and kept their heads all the time in face of very critical circumstances. I doubt whether Mrs. Hart will now decide to go down to Seistan, since it is obvious the road is none too secure and she does not wish to risk Kieth’s life again. Her wound may possibly deprive her of the use of two fingers, though this is not yet certain. She is naturally suffering from shock. Hart caught a bad cold as a result of passing a considerable time in his underclothes on the hillside at night, and is also pretty badly shaken. He is, however, pulling round. From the report, which is entirely unexaggerated, you will be able to gather that apart from any action I forced the authorities to take, they did precisely nothing. The Harts lost property which probably amounts to 1,000 tomans at least. (Mrs. Hart’s engagement ring alone cost £40, and I am sure you, and the Legation, will do what you can to try to get compensation for them from the Persian Government, since the raid and the subsequent get-away of the gang brought out clearly the lack of efficiency and inaction of the authorities in the matter of raid protection.)Summarising these shortcomings from a military point of view, they were as follows :— 1. The amnieh arrangements on this mountainous and exposed section of road are quite inadequate to afford any protection, in that— (а) At the post of Robat-i-Khami there are only two men, and as far as can be ascertained certainly one, and possibly both, were absent from their post at the time the incident took place. This can be proved, since the gendarme, Nasrulla, who fired on the bandits came from the direction of the village of Khami, more than a mile from the post, where it appears he had been warned of the firing by a villager. (б) When Fazal Haq’s lorry turned back on seeing armed men on the hills, they found the amnieh post deserted and consequently went on to Asadabad. (c) The absence of any telephone or telegraphic communication between these posts on the road renders the possibility of co-operation entirely impossible (even supposing they had the courage to leave their posts, which seems doubtful in view of the refusal to act on the part of the four men at Asadabad). (d) Two amnieh soldiers travelling on lorries, apparently not on duty, took the precaution of removing the badges from their hats when they heard a hold-up had taken place, so that they might not be called upon to act. 2. The closing down by night of the telegraph office at Meshed hardly calls for comment. It is self-evident that this gives any incident (including an invasion of the country) a twelve-hour untroubled start, and as long as the Persians are prepared to accept this state of affairs there is nothing to be said. 3. The inaction of the military authorities, or amnieh, in Meshed has already been fully commented on in the report. Energetic action would have undoubtedly enabled the pursuing detachment to have found themselves at daybreak within five or six miles of the gang, who, loaded with loot, could hardly have made much progress during the night, and, probably making an accurate estimate of the inaction of the authorities, may even have camped till dawn quite close to the scene of the raid. 4. The failure of the Amir Lashkar to carry out his promise to send a lorry with soldiers and a dresser frankly surprised me, not that I anticipated much assistance in any case. I have sent a copy of this report to Tehran by special courier, since even to-day (the 22nd) the Amir Lashkar, when asked about the security of the road (with reference to the departure of Mr. Zia-ud-Din), replied that it would be advisable to wait for the latest information on the subject from Turbat. In my opinion, unless the Persian authorities act with energy in capturing or frightening off this band, the exact strength of which is not known, further raids may be expected in this sector at any time, since they definitely did well out of it and were not seriously worried. A list of the articles taken, together with their estimated value, will be forwarded as soon as possible. I am, &amp;c. L. W. HAMPER. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Mr. Kuatchbull-Hugessen to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. le Ministre, Tehran, December 1, 1934. AS your Excellency is already aware, the car in which Mr. Hart, a member of the staff of His Majesty’s consulate-general at Meshed, together with Mrs. Hart, their child and servants, were travelling from Meshed to Birjand, was fired on and held up by bandits on the 18th November (27th Aban), near Turbat- i Haidari. Mrs. Hart, the chauffeur, and the cleaner were wounded, and the6 cleaner, who is believed to be a British subject, has since died. Moreover, Mr. and Mrs. Hart were robbed of personal effects, the exact value of which has not yet been ascertained, but is probably well in excess of £100 (one hundred pounds). 2. In view of the serious nature of this affair, I feel compelled to bring to your Excellency’s notice the details of the incident, given in the enclosed memorandum. 3. The particulars in the enclosed memorandum have been given to your Excellency in some detail in order to indicate that, according to the information in my possession, the local authorities have been gravely dilatory and deficient in their duties. For your Excellency’s convenience I will summarise the chief points:— (1) In spite of the utmost insistence on his part, Major Hamber was unable to obtain four men and six rifles from the Chief of Staff until three and a quarter hours had elapsed. (2) Iraj Khan, the Amir Lashkar, personally promised Major Hamber that a lorry, with twenty soldiers and a dresser to give first-aid to the wounded men, would be sent after him without delay. This lorry had not reached Robat-i- Kiiami (two hours distant by motor) by noon on the next day, and, as it was not passed by Major Hamber on his return journey to Meshed, it cannot, therefore, have left Meshed before 4 p.m. on the day after the hold-up, some fourteen hours after Major Hamber had applied to Iraj Khan for help. I would also draw your Excellency’s attention to the following points :— (3) The amnieh post at Robat-i-Khami was visited at the time of the hold up by another clerk of His Majesty’s consulate-general, who found it empty. Had men been on duty there, they should have been able to attack the brigands promptly. (4) The amnieh post at Asadabad, 16 miles from the site of the hold-up, which, as I understand, contains four men, was warned at 8 p.m. on the 18th November by Mrs. Hart of what had occurred. Mrs. Hart begged them to go to the rescue of her husband, who had been left on the road with the two wounded men. I am informed that, though there were numbers of cars which could have taken them to Robat-i-Khami, they refused to leave—stating that they would start “next morning.’’ 4. It is clear to me from the foregoing that the local authorities displayed regrettable dilatoriness in dealing with this serious affair. Had immediate steps been taken, and, in particular, had Iraj Khan fulfilled his promise to send out a lorry with twenty armed men, it is probable that the bandits, who could not have moved very far in such broken country by night, would have been captured and their booty recovered. As it is, ten days have now passed, and no news has yet reached me of the capture of the brigands or the return of the stolen property. 5. I rely on your Excellency to apprise me as soon as possible, for the information of my Government (to whom I have reported the occurrence), what steps are being taken for the apprehension of the murderers and the return of the stolen property. In addition, I have the honour to request that a full enquiry be made into the facts of the case and should be grateful if I might be informed what action has been taken. 6. I am, at the same time, happy to draw your attention to the conduct of Nasrullah Khan, No. 609, who, as I have already mentioned, was responsible for driving off the brigands by long-range fire. This man was the only member of the Persian armed forces who rendered active assistance on his own responsibility. His conduct was in striking contrast with that of the other officials involved, and there is no doubt that his action in opening fire when he did saved Mr. and Mrs. Hart from further indignities, if not from death. I shall be grateful if an expression of thanks can be conveyed to him on behalf of myself and of Mr. and Mrs. Hart. % 7. Mrs. Hart, who is recovering from her wound, will be unable to travel for some weeks. In these circumstances it will not be possible for Mr. Hart to proceed to Zabul, where he is urgently required by His Majesty's consul-general, and it is accordingly proposed that Captain Rose, at present His Majesty’s vice- consul at Meshed, shall go to Zabul instead. I understand that raiding is taking place at frequent intervals on the road between Meshed and Zabul, and I have7 therefore the honour to request that an escort may be provided to convoy Captain Rose on his journey. I shall be glad if telegraphic orders in this sense can be sent without delay to Meshed, and if I may be informed when they have been despatched. I avail, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Memorandum. THE party were attacked within 3 miles of the amnieh post at Robat-i- Khami, in which, however, no gendarmes were present at the time. Besides the fact, already stated, that Mrs. Hart, the chauffeur and cleaner were wounded by rifle fire, the party were stripped of most of their clothes and all their valuables, including Mrs. Hart’s rings, were taken from them; moreover, the brigands maltreated them in their endeavours to extract more from them. Had it not been for the arrival of some lorries, which diverted the attention of the brigands, it appears more than probable that Mrs. Hart would have been abducted, one of the thieves having more than once asserted his intention of carrying her off. The brigands finally left in some haste when long-range fire was opened on them by an amnieh man, who had heard of the hold-up from local villagers. 2. The news was first brought to His Majesty’s consulate-general by Mrs. Hart, who with her son returned on a lorry to Meshed at about midnight. Mr. Hart was meanwhile left with the two wounded men at the site of the hold-up. On learning from Mrs. Hart what had taken place, Major Hamber, secretary to His Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed, immediately took steps to warn the military authorities. He woke the Chief of Staff and asked him for four soldiers with two extra rifles for himself and his chauffeur in order to proceed at once to the scene of the occurrence. The Chief of Staff, after con siderable delay, called on the head of the amnieh to provide the men, but it was not until three and a quarter hours after the Chief of Staff had first been warned that these men were forthcoming. The Amir Lashkar, who had meanwhile appeared, promised to send out a lorry with twenty men and a dresser as soon as possible. 3. Major Hamber, with his chauffeur and the four soldiers, then drove in his own car to Robat-i-Khami, which he reached at about 5-30 a.m. There he found Mr. Hart and the two wounded men. He waited for over six hours for the lorry which Iraj Khan had personally promised to send. The lorry never came, so after waiting in vain till noon, Major Hamber drove Mr. Hart and the wounded men back to Meshed. At about 2 p.m. on the afternoon after the affair, when he was half-way to Meshed, he met the Reis-i-Amnieh and four men. This was the total assistance rendered by the local authorities.

I agree that in view of attitude taken up by Minister for Foreign ...ffairs it will be preferable not to press claim ( against Persian Government as of right, at any rate at this stage. On the other hand report enclosed in your despatch No.528 (of December 1st) makes it clear that case was very bad one and that Amir Iashkar at -^eshed showed gross negligence in not immediately taking action against brigands and to rescue survivors. Moreover, it seems clear that the material losses incurred by Mr. and Mrs. Hart must have been very considerable and it is d esirabie to make quite sure that figure of £220 given in your telegram No.209 (of December 24th) is not an under estimate. There must clearly be no question of scaling down the value of the articles lost or damaged, and if one ring aloiB was worth £40 the balance of £180 seems very low for the loss of practically all personal effects, clothing, other jewellery, cash, etc. I entirely agree that compensation is also properly payable to Mrs. Hart if, as seems probable, she sustains permanent injury to her right arm, and i consider that fair amount for this would be £500. I agree, however that compensation for shock is much more difficult to assess, and that it will be better to concentrate on compensation for material losses or physical2 . physical injury. Compensation for death of assistant chauffeur, at any rate to extent of hospital and burial expenses, would also be most desirable, but in view of doubt as to his nationality and. of his apparent evasion of Persian regulations, it may be difficult to press for this. while therefore I see no objection to your expressing appreciation of His Majesty’s Government for the statement made by the Persian minister for Foreign affairs as reported in your telegram No.194 (of December 17th) I should prefer to reserve right to press claim against Persian Government if they show any inclination to pay inadequate compensation or to defer payment unduly. If, however, you can obtain really adequate I compensation without undue delay by friendly agreement, I am prepared not to pursue claim as of right, though it is desirable that nothing should be said to exonerate Persian Government, since this might conceivably create embarrassing precedent in connexion with other brigandage claims which it may eventually become necessary to pursue.

ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER NO. -II -3 UAN 1935 FROM SECRETARY, POliiwAL AuD SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE With reference to Foreign Office printed letter No.E.7564/7020/34 of 21st December 1934 on the subject of the recent assault on the Vice-Consul at I Meshed and his party, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward herewith copies of two telegrams from the Government of India in which they suggest that compensation should be 'claimed from the Persian Government not only for the material loss but also for the injuries and shock suffered by the victims of the incident. Sir Samuel Hoare has not yet been informed of the full details of the affair, particularly as regards the reported negligence of the Persian authorities, and he recognises that the Persian Government have already adopted a helpful and sympathetic attitude^ towards the case. He notes in particular from Tehran telegram No.194 of 17th December that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has spontaneously stated that in the event of Mrs.Hart’s possessions not being recovered the Persian Government will make payment in canpensation. On the other hand it appears that Mrs.Hart’s wound may result in permanent disability in the use of her arm and that one of the 3164 5000 10.34 men who lost their lives in the attack may/may have been a British subject. In view of this the Secretary of State would suggest that, if Sir John Simon sees no objection, His Majesty^s Minister, Tehran, might be instructed/ after expressing the appreciation of H.M.G. for the statement made by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs as reported in his telegram No.194 of 17th December, to suggest to His Excellency that compensation should be paid to Mrs.Hart for her injuries and to enter a caveat that compensation may also be claimed in respect of the dead man if the latter should prove to have been in fact a British subject. In this connection Sir Samuel Hoare recognises that it may not be possible to ask for compensation if enquiries should show that the man in question was a person both of Persian and of British nationality.

Later advices from Meshed show that Mrs Hart's wound may result in permanent disability in the use of the arm owing to the damaged merve, and we are strongly of opinion that compensation for shook and wound should be paid by the Persian Government in addition to compensation for loss of property. 2.

Tae assault on Mr. Morton has now two aspects: (l) criminal, (2) civil. Under the latter, Mr. Morton claims for damages. I do not suppose that he has the slightest chance of getting any thing in the way of damages from the Persian Government , and I propose, subject to your approval, to inform him of this. 1 propose adding that if he wishes to pursue his claim the only course he can take is to file a civil suit in the Persian court against his assailant , which I think he can do under the Persian Law, but that, first, it is not much use his doing this until his assailants have been convicted of criminal assault M (which they have not yet been), and egen if he won his case, his assailants are men of no substance. 2. The criminal side of the case, is, of course, important since the conviction of Mr. Morton’s assailants and tneir punishment would have a good effect and tend to prevent other assaults on British subjects. In this connection please see correspondence ending with my letter to you,No.61/1251 dated the 13th June 1933. ( I hear that MrS, Prickfe ’s assailant has been released on the ground tnat there was insufficient evidence against him )• His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas, reports that no action has been taken by the locallocal authorities against Mr. Morton’s assailants and they have been let out on bail, one of them being actually employed by the Police Department. 3. As you will have seen from the final sentence of my telegram Ko.63 of the 8th June 1933, and paragraph 3 of Colonel Loch’s despatch No.103/1907 of the 4th September 1933, the Governor of Bushire has been approached but with little success. 4.

Norton of the Imperial and International Communications Company Ltd, at Hen 0 am on the night ol the 5 th June . 2. H.N. Ship under my command arrived at Henjam p.m on Tuesday from Basidu. On arrival hr. Harding (in Charge of Imperial and Irfernational Communications Co f s branch at Henjam) came on board to see me. 3. He stated that at 2115 a. T. on the previous night (5th June) Nr. Morton (Mr. Harding’s ’Second in Command’) was returning to his quarters and was set upon from behind by 3 natives, one of whom struck him on the forehead with a stick. 4. Although the weapon has not been found the evidence points to the fact that it was Hocmey Stick. 5. After the attack, the three assailants fled and Nr. Norton, who was (±uite close to his quarters, was able to continue his way home. Nr. Harding, who lives in the same building happened to be standing outside and saw Jr. Morton approaching. 7. The latter had his hat on and only complained that his nose was bleeding. It was not until Mr.Harding had got Mr. Morton to his room that the full extent of his injuries was apparent. 8. Nr. Harding realising the seriousness of the case, at once sent for the Telegraph Doctor, the NAZMIDH, and the Persian 'suUarantine Medical Officer.18 ./ 9. It was I'ound that Kr. l r orton had an incised wound about 2 inches long extending obliquely across the centre of his forehead, down to the bone* 10. i:r. Harding stated that the 1U£M3H aljbnce realised the seriousness or the case ana toe* all available steps forthwith. He inobilised all his police and rounded up eleven suspects that night. 11. He also olferea to place an arrued guard on the Telegraph official’s house at once. 12. The next rcornigg (6th June) seven of the prisoners were reieasea, as their aiibis were consiaered satisfac to ry. 13. T r r. Hording asked me whether our doctor could go ashore and give a second opinion on Kr. l-ortorf s condition. 14. The request was naturally acceded to at once and Surgeon Lt. Goiiiniander 1'aione went ashore a na examined the patient. The resulting Medical opinion was given in my signal to you of 6th June. 15 • Morton * s condition was such, that on Thursday 8th June, it was decided that the best thing to do would be to send him to Karachi to hospital. He was accordingly sent ofi in S.S.
