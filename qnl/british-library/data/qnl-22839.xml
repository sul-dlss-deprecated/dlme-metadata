I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting you in Bahrein but I should very much like to do so during my next visit there. T do hope you will excuse the liberty of writing to you like this but T feel that I must. During my stay in this part of the world I have taken the keenest interest in the politics concerning this area, considering them as I do of vital importance to the British Empire. T have also taken it upon myself to learn all I am able about the visits of people to this area. No one has any idea that I do this and it so happens that through -he American Consulate, the Aramco Government Relations department, as v/ell as a number of the local Arab authorities ~T find myself the possessor of a number of facts that I consider it my duty as an Englishman to pass on to you. Mr. Jean de fuhusky and a Mr. pixton (the former Polish and the latter English) have been viewed with considerable suspicion. These two men arrived from Jeddah and apparently have permission to make a documentary film on the life of Ting Ibn saud. It is said that this per mission was given by the Arabian Finance Minister. No one has any knowledge of these men and it is noted with concern that their interests and photography have little or no bearing on the work they are supposed to be performing. Their main interests are in the harbour and oil installations in this area. Another gentleman of which little is known, is a person who calls himself William Frary. He is or was a German Count and now apparently hails from Boston U.3.A. It is said that he is E.E. &amp; M.C. for Poland, Greece and Saudi Arabia to the United States. The first two men are proceeding to Kuwait and will shortly return to this part of the country when I hope to have an opportunity to meet them. I hope you will receive this information in the spirit it is given and if I may call on you at some future date perhaps I may be told if I can be of any assistance. I would be pleased to learn that the mistrust shown to the above gentlemen is completely unfounded. Could you please write or ask if I might call on you through Mr. Ueikle, Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd. Bahrein ? I am an employee of Gray Mackenzie and I an: sure that Mr. Meikle will be only too pleased to furnish you with any information regarding myself. I am, Sir, yours sincerely. Sd./- C.S. FREKBURY. The political Agent, Bahrein.u f . S^CR^T ^ aaSUT, GULF REalDERCY EAHiUIR the 24th January, 1948 1W ^ Henderson, the American Consul at Dhahran, has told me that information has been received that three men have been trained in a Russian military intelligence school in Bulgaria for work at Dhahran and that they have been instructed to obtain information about railways, ports etc. Two of the .en are Palestinian Arabs and the third a Bulgar. Henderson asked that a look out should be kept for these men at Bahrain in case they travelled to Dhahran by route. Please take any action you think necessary. 2. Henderson considers it possible however that the men may have already arrived in Dhahran as the Soviet newspapers have recently been publishing articles about relations between ARAMCO and their labour which display considerable local knowledge.

Liyii (G We write to. thank you for your communication No. 2072-3 of December 1st enclosing a co^y of a letter from Mr. Freebury of Has Tanura. Of the three persons mentioned in his letter, two are known ,to us, namely Mr. Jean de Kuharsky and Mr. Pixton. They arrived in Jedda towards the end of September for the purpose of discussing a proposal to make a film of the life of King I bn Saud. Mr. de Kuharsky had any letters of introduction, including two from Mr. Arthur Greenwood, and we believe that his entry into the country was arranged by the Saudi Arabian Minister in London. Mr. Pixton was Mr. de Kuharski's assistant. They had -a draft script prepared for subudssion to the King, and there seems to be no doubt that their intentions were serious, though very little is known about them in London. eventually their proposal was not accepted, and we heard that they had left for Lgypt some time in November. - We have'never heard of Mr. william Frary.
