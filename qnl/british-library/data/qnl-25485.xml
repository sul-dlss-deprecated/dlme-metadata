Petevsbuvgh, July 22, IQIL HEAD of Persian Department in Ministry of Foreign Affairs told me yesterday that he was anxiously awaiting our reply to note enclosed in my despatch No. 194, as Russian Government consider request for option should he presented at once. Bagdad Railway was making rapid progress, and it was therefore most important that construction of northern section of Trans-Persian Railway should he commenced without delay. _ . I said that we had not yet received final reply of Russian group with regard to alignment and other matters which M. Zveguintsef had promised me. His Majesty s Government were prohahly waiting for its receipt before replying to above-mentioned note. . M. Klemm said that Russian group were in negotiation with two other groups on these questions, but that agreement was not likely to be reached for some time to come. He therefore trusted that His Majesty’s Government would agree to request for option being presented at once, leaving above-mentioned points to be settled within a year of its being granted. (End of R.) According to this Russian proposal, alignment will run direct from Tehran to Yezd, with branch line to Ispahan, while question of alignment in south will be left open. In conversation yesterday French President of the Council spoke to me m favour of such an arrangement, and I trust that His Majesty s Government will see their way to accepting it. It is, I think, important that we should arrive at an agree ment about railway at the same time as about other questions at piesent under discussion. z: [2192 y—i\ r O'-v i ; Zc’Z I , ' '* &lt; ;*».&lt; /{This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] [Bj PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA.

In reply 1 am to state that, in the circumstances disclosed m the correspondence forwarded with your letter, the Board concur in Sir E.

Sazonof in September 1912 and to the statement contained in paragraph 11 of the note com municated to the Russian Government m Apul last. . In view however, of the fact that up to the present neither the Russian Government nor the Societe d’Etudes nor the British group appear to have shown any great disposition to meet the essential requirements of His Majesty’s Government as set out in their memorandum of April last, and especially in view of the hostile criticism of that memorandum contained in Sir W. Garstm’s letter of the Sth May and reaffirmed in his letter of the 3rd July, the Board feel that it would be very dangerous for His Majesty’s Government to join m any application for an option except upon the most stringent conditions that the option is not to extend beyond a year, unless within that time a settlement of all outstanding questions has been If this condition can be effectively secured, it appears to the Board the draft application which was forwarded in the letter from the British group of the Societe d’Etudes under date of the 3 rd July is worded m sufficiently general terms to enable His Majesty’s Government to deal satisfactorily with the various points raised in the memorandum to the Russian Government of April last. . ^ , On the point as to mineral rights which is referred to in your letter the Board cannot but think that a demand for exclusive rights in a strip 45 miles wide ' J “ , e “' h ■ side of the projected railway would be excessive; it will be borne m mind that the Bagdad Railway Company are only guaranteed a strip of 20 kilom. on each side of their line The Board agree, however, with the suggestion m your letter that the whole question of mineral rights in the region adjoining the railway should be reserved for further consideration, and that the option to be applied tor should be without mention of anything in the nature of a concession of mineral rights. On the point as to a retrocession to a special company of any concession to the Societe for the construction of a port, I am to say that the Board “e no harm thTs matter being arranged between the Societe and the Foreign Office, provided !hat “be expressfy stipulated that the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the anolication for the railway concession proceeding is given on the distinct undei standing that the conditions they have previously laid down in this regard are accepted an Will ^ a t d he er pHnt 0 of the Russian Foreign Minister’s note to Sir G.

IN reply to your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the Trans-Persian Railway, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request that you will inform the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that they appreciate the desire of the Russian Government to apply immediately for an option, and also the reasons which must weigh with His Majesty’s Government against giving cause to the Russian Government to proceed independently with railway development in Northern Persia. 2 At the same time, it was distinctly understood that the outstanding questions between the Societe d’Etudes on the one hand, and the Kerman Mining Syndicate and the Persian Railway Syndicate on the other, were to be settled prior to the option being applied for. So far the Societe d’Ptudes have done nothing (so far as my Lords know) to facilitate the arrangement of these questions, and they are still outstanding. If therefore the option be now obtained, the Societe d’Etudes will be in a position to force the hands of these two syndicates in a manner favourable to itself, unless a very definite undertaking is given that a settlement will be reached shortly on an equitable basis.

Before dealing with the precise reference made, it may he pointed ont that any discnssion on this subject seems to be now of a somewhat academic nature, seeing that the British and Russian Governments have agreed to a joint application to the Persian Government for an option for this railway on the understanding that when . it reaches the Russian frontier of the neutral sphere, a Ru^so-British I echmcal T Commission” shall be appointed to examine the two routes (viz that via feinraz, and that via Kerman), and report to their respective Governments beioie an} decision 13 taken as to the continuation of theGine through the neutral sphere. Since Russian commercial and strategical aims are clearly directed on an alignment via Kerman—and it is improbable that engineering difficulties on that alignment will be greater than on the alternative Shiraz route it would appear^ self evident that the Russians, with a free hand as far as \ezd 111 their own spheie, will so align and construct the railway within that sphere as to leave no room for discussion as to the route to be followed southwards. _ 3. The main points referred to the Imperial General Staff by the India Office may be summarised as :— Firstly, the effect on the defence of India of an alignment of the Trans-Persian Railway via Kerman; and _ . Secondly, whether any, and if so what, increase to the army in India is rendered necessary by such an alignment. 4. The question of a railwray from the Russian frontier via Tehran aligned via, Kerman may be treated from two main standpoints, viz. :— (a.) That of a railway passing through Kerman ; and (b.) That of a railway ending at Kerman. 5. As regards such a railway passing through Kerman, whether to link up with the Indian railway system at Nushki or Karachi, the^Chief of the Imperial General Staff is in complete agreement with the opinion against such a proposal expressed by the Chief of the General Staff in India. He is also opposed for strategical reasons to any proposal to permit such a railway direct access to the sea at a port east of the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas. 0. Regarding a railway reaching, but not passing east of Kerman or southwards to the sea east of the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff holds that the position is different, and that no cogent military objection can be urged to the construction of such a line, subject to certain essential provisos. He is led to this conclusion by a consideration of the following factors :— Kerman is some 350 miles from the Helmund, in Sistan, and some GOO miles from Nushki. Granting a possible rate of Russian railway construction of 1 mile per day—a liberal estimate and one making every alkrwance for Russian potentialities—a Russian prolongation of the railway beyond Kerman would take approximately one year to reach the Hehnund, in Sistan, or one and two-third years to reach Nushki. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff is convinced that no war at the present day between two leading European Powers—whether the primary theatre of operations is on the north-west frontier of India or elsewhere—can be localised. Modem economic conditions and political considerations forbid such a possibility, and, in his opinion, render it certain that the pressure on India would be relieved, and a decision be reached in Europe within a year of the outbreak of war. He holds therefore that Russia could not develop strength against India from an independent railhead pushed forward on the outbreak of war with Kerman in time to be of use to her in a general advance upon India. But this opinion, based on the existing situation, is subject to the following essential provisos :— (a.) That for strategical reasons it be recognised and acted on as a cardinal point of British policy that any extension by the Russians of the railway eastwards from Kerman, or southwards to the sea east of the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas, without express British concurrence, be treated as a casus belli; and ( 6 .) I hat beiore the railway from Tehran reaches Kerman, a British controlled railway shall have reached Kerman already from a port, similarly controlled, in the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas, and thus form the sole through continuation from Kerman to the sea. This has been urged for commercial reasons, is necessary from considerations of British prestige, and is advisable for strategical reasons.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff therefore thinks that should diplomacy fail to gain Russian acceptance of the more westerly alignment from Tehran via Yezd and Saidabad to the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas, which from the strategical point of view is regarded as the one least objectionable, the Kerman alignment may be /agreed to in so far as military considerations are concerned, subject to the express conditions referred to above. 7. Regarding the question of whether any, and if so what, increase to the army in India would be rendered necessary by the construction of a railway from the Russian frontier via Tehran to or beyond Kerman, the essential principle to - be observed appears to be that the army in India should be strong enough to delay any hostile advance sufficiently long to enable the diplomatic, economic, and military resources of the Empire to be brought to bear in order to relieve the pressure on India and decide the issue elsewhere. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thinks that no addition to the present field army of nine divisions and eight cavalry brigades in India would be required so long as the conditions referred to in the preceding paragraph are observed, and provided these divisions and cavalry brigades'are fully organised, their training and equipment in all respects maintained at a high standard of excellence, and the state of peace preparation in India such as to ensure rapid mobilisation, concentration, and the ready execution of the necessary plans of campaign. 8 . But should any extensions of the Tehran-Kerman Railway east of a north and south line through Kerman be forced upon us, he is of opinion that pro tanto an increase in the strength of the army in India (as defined above) would be necessary^ For such extensions would, by providing Russia with a third or (if the Alexandrof Gai-Oharjui project matures, and a-line be constructed southwards through Khoiasan) possibly a fourth—independent line of railway approach to the Indian frontier, tent ei the defence of that frontier a matter of such difficulty as to tax the military resources of the Empire to the utmost, owing to the enormous superiority of numbers which Russia would then be in a position to keep in the field. , . rr In this connection it must be borne in mind that even two years would not su ice to produce an increase of any military value, i.e,, one of all arms with British and Indian troops in due proportion. Consequently any augmentation decided on would have to be made from three to five years in advance of such extension&amp;.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 30,252, of the 13th instant, on the subject of the Trans-Persian Railway. 2. The Marquess of Crewe agrees that, in view of the insistence of the Russian Government, and of the terms of the memorandum enclosed in Sir E. Grey’s Despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador, St. Petersburg, dated 4th October 1912, it is difficult for His Majesty’s Government not to agree to an immediate application, in general terms, for an option for a railway across Persia. But he doubts whether that course should be taken until an agreement has been arrived at between the Societe and the two British Syndicates regarding the claim to mining rights which has been put forward by the former since the date of the memorandum above referred to. Lord Crewe is afraid that British consent to an immediate application would destroy the one lever wdiich Ilis Majesty s Government possess to secure the recognition of British interests, and that when it is destroyed the Russian Government and the Societe will be in no hurry to enter upon further negotiations with the Syndicates. If there were any reason to suppose that the Persian Railways Syndicate were not in a position to take up at once any concession that it may obtain, Lord Crewe would advise that His Majesty’s Government should with draw their support from it in favour of the Societe. But his Lordship believes that this Syndicate as well as the Persian Mining Syndicate is a bond fide undertaking with a considerable stake in the country and a real interest in its commercial development, and in that respect also more entitled to the-support of His Majesty’s Government than the British group of the Societe. 3. While, however, his Lordship is not pre pared to advise that concessions should be made to the Societe on this point, it may perhaps be possible to meet them in some other ways, and he is of opinion that it is a matter of urgent necessity to find some means of moving them from the non possumus attitude taken up in Sir Y\ . Garstin s letter of 3 rd May and re-affirmed in his letter of 3rd July. Otherwise, if and when the option is obtained, time which is of vital importance to British interests will be lost in settling all the other outstanding questions. He would therefore urge that discussions should at once he opened with the British group with that object in view. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.o 4. So far as can be j ndged from the iangnag of the former communication the difficult} by the British group (apart from the question o mining rights) is two-fold : _ . . , (i ) The limitation of the scope of the original proposals. This, it is thought, will prevent the project from appealing to the imagination ol the investing public, negative the hope of 0 btamm o financial guarantees from the associated Go\e ments, and diminish its commercial possibi.ities. The British group evidently regard it m its piesen shape as one for which they would not care to attempt to raise capital. . , • (ii ) The unattractiveness of the project is enhanced by the alignment laid down by His Majesty’s Government, which is not the nio» suitable even for local development. 5. These points must be taken togethei. If the scheme is to find support, as British inteiests urgently require that it should, it must be made attractive on purely commercial grounc =&gt;. And if a Government guarantee in any shape or form is out of the question, His Majesty s Government must, as far as possible, withdraw conditions which deprive the line of a reasonable prospect of paying without a guarantee. Irom this point of view the alignment is of vital importance. The alignment last proposed by His Majesty’s Government was recommended by the interdepartmental conference for reasons^ which were good., but wore not ubsolutoly conclusive, cind were not mainly commercial. From the com mercial point of view Lord Crewe believes that the correct alignment is via Kerman-Bam-Regan- Bunder Abbas, and he understands that Sir W. Johns regards this route as greatly preferable for engineering reasons also, since construction will be' easier and very much quicker. In view, therefore, of the change of ^military opinion regarding the importance of Kerman itself, His Lordship does not think that exception need be taken to that alignment for strategical reasons, provided always that the condition that there shall be no extension to the coast east of Bunder Abbas be maintained, and he believes that this alteration would add greatly to the commercial attractiveness of the scheme. If _ it be adopted, the question of gauge will require further consideration. It is understood that Sir W. Johns is of opinion that the adoption of the Russian gauge to the coast will be a heavy burden to the scheme, since it will be both expensive and unnecessary for the local development of the country. Further, it has always been stipulated by the Government of India that the break of gauge should be made at the point where the line enters the British sphere, which would be Kerman. 6 . Sir W. Johns has now retired from active service and is in this country. Lord Crewe would&lt;§} suggest that Sir E. Grey should, as soon as con venient, consult him upon all technical aspects of the southern section of the railway, and then should invite the British group to confer and to state dehnitely whether they are prepared to proceed with the scheme upon such conditions as it may then he possible to put before them ; and it would, in his Lordship’s opinion, be advisable to allow them to discuss these conditions with Sir W. Johns. If they decline to proceed, it will then be urgently necessary to endeavour to find another group, such as the Persian Railways Syndicate, to take their place. 7. As regards the question of alignment referred to at the end of the Russian Government’s note, Lord Crewe would not object to the main line running through Yezd on the condition that the branch to Ispahan is constructed simultaneously, and not subsequently as proposed by the Russian Government. 8 .

With reference to my letter of the 9th ultimo, I have the honour to inform you that the “Memorandum for communication to the Russian Government” which accompanied your letter of the 8th April, 1914, has been duly brought to the notice of the Societe internationale d’Etudes. A meeting was held in Paris on the 2nd May, at which careful consideration was given to the general principles, as well as to the points of detail, set forth in the Foreign Office memorandum in so far as they affect the interests of the Societe d’Etudes. The comments wdiich the Societe as a whole considers appropriate will find expression in a memorandum which is in course of preparation and will shortly be presented to the Foreign Office. In the meantime, the British group think that they ought to lose no time in laying before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs a, statement of their views on those aspects of the subject which specifically affect their own group. Your covering letter of the 8th ultimo now under reply draws attention to the necessity of an agreement between the Societe d’fitudes, on the one hand, and two syndicates, constituting the Greenway group, on the other. In the memorandum it is explained that the form of agreement which His Majesty s Government have in view, and without which they are not prepared to give support to the Societe d’fitudes, would involve amalgamation of the two syndicates (yH., the Kerman Mining Syndicate and the Persian Railways Syndicate) with the Societe. An outline of the terms under which His Majesty’s Government and the Greenway group would favour the said amalgamation is added. These terms, if accepted, would result in the following position:— The Societe w r ould obtain official support for their application to the Persian authorities for a railway concession across Persia, to wdiich would attach rights to the minerals (exclusive, so far as Southern Persia is concerned, of oil and mines aheady located) in a zone on each side of the projected line. As consideration for such support, the Societe would— (a) Commit itself, in principle, to the construction, at its owm cost, of a railway on the alignment now indicated (subject to Russian approval) by the British Government. ... , .c (b.) Agree to co-operate in procuring the Russian Government s support lor me ratification of the Kerman mining concession. _ , (c.) Guarantee, in the event of the railway being built, adequate facilities for tne carriage of the Kerman Mining Syndicate’s products. . (d.) Agree, in the event of mining rights within the proposed railway-belt being obtained by the Societe, to administer those rights by means of a sub-company m which the Kerman Syndicate would be given participation. _ . . (e.) Agree, in the event of a port concession being obtained, to administer it by means of a sub-company in which other British enterprises would be given participation^ ^ the British group t0 fuse their interests, if terms acceptable to both parties can be arranged, wdth those of the Persian Railways Syndicate. The British group having been thus reorganised, the Societe d’Etudes as a whole would be required (in accordance with previous correspondence) to divide itseil into two constituents—a northern-company, in which the British interest would be per cent and a southern company, in which the British interest would be 60 per cent - At soon as construction imd been started by tbe northern company, the southern [2133 i—l] r2 company would come under liability to defray the cost of *^'0 ^ 0 ^^'™^ section f and as soon as the northern line reaped Tehran,^toesoutn ^ within aXe^ertimel^fwo^eVp'ocure the northern company to stop further will be borne in mind that the studying the feasibility ol a railway connec 1 . a commerc ial point of view, scheme which although perhaps lacking m e viewed as a contribution to became one which was obviously entitled ^ Great Powers who political considerations, J to add that it was felt category of those whose aims are en ^ reqnirements might lessen the at the same time that, m proportion as Governmentai reqmreme 8 commercial attractions of the project “ ^ ^T^n^terUXd rtha^na^raM from Governmental sources w ' t ^g^yg*^^&gt;™ 1 ®^an^ial^adidsers° indled!'have lost no opportunity of making it clear that a railway so dependent on Government regulation could not hope, on its own merits, to obtain from British investors the funds necessary for its construction and deVel TCe n facts being premised, the Societe deludes now find themselves for the first time in a position to survey the full scope of the undertaking m which they are asked t0 he 6 important question of alignment, seeing that it is still dependent on the Russian Government’s approval, may be set aside for the moment. ^ ] , remark that the selection of a route has been imposed by circumstances beyond the Societe’s control. The other conditions prescribed seem to the British group to be ot a nature to place difficulties in the way of the Socffite, where privileges and concessions might not unreasonably have been looked for. The Societe s business, as the British group see it, is to concentrate its attention on a trans-Persian line of railway ; f e 7 have no ambition for amalgamation with syndicates or groups whose amis they do not profess to understand, with whose operations they do not seek to interfere, and about whose vested interests in Persian territory they had no specific knowledge when they were first invited to study the question of a trans-Persian line. . . , Knowing the complexity of the questions involved, the British group have been willing to wait until a trace and conditions satisfactory to their Government could be elaborated by the expert officials to whom the task was entrusted. The ^ ra ^ e n0 ^ r indicated, in the choosing of which they have had no voice, and which departs radically from the principle under which the original scheme was conceived, turns out to be hampered by conditions which, if complied with, would transform the bociete s position from that of a concessionary into that of a conceding party, leaving as they do on the shoulders of the Societe, and resting with special weight on the shoulders ot the British group, the whole burden of financing and developing what has all the appearance of being (at any rate in its earlier years) an unprofitable railway. _ The British group are animated by a sincere desire to meet the situation m a helpful spirit; but they see no prospect of being able to acquiesce in the programme which is indicated in the “Memorandum for communication to the Russian Government,” and they feel that they would not be justified in committing themselves, even in principle, to the serious liabilities which underlie the present proposals. They have therefore authorised me, as already stated, to place the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in possession of the views which I have endeavoured to outline above, and to express their regret that they have not been able to read those parts of the memorandum with which they are directly concerned as furnishing a practical basis for their co-operation.

Sir W. Garstin to Foreign Ojjice.—{Received Jidy 4.) 8, Bishoysgate, London, July 3, 1914. # SINCE 1 bad the honour of addressing vou on the 8th May in regard to the affairs of the Societe internationale d’Etudes du Chemin de Fer transpersan, a meeting of this body has been held in Paris. At this meeting it was urged by our French and Ttussian associates that, in justice to the interests of the societe as a whole, the question of applying to the Persian Government for an option for a Trans-Persian railway might fairly be dissociated from the arrangements and adjustments which the Foreign Office memorandum of the 8th April stipulates as conditions precedent to the grant of Foreign Office support. The Societe d’Etudes propose, therefore, on their part, to refrain from further comment upon the aforesaid document at the present juncture ; but with a view to avoiding further delay in their operations, and in order to enable them to obtain the option for a Trans-Persian line of railway which they desire and which appears to be acceptable in principle to the Governments interested, they venture to suggest that the stipulation in regard to the retrocession of a port concession to a special company would more opportunely be included in an undertaking to be entered into between the societe and the Foreign Office than in the text of the actual letter of the societe to the Persian Government. Should this be admitted, it is hoped that in the text now enclosed the Foreign Office will consider the slight modification at the end of the last paragraph as covering the requirements of paragraph 8 of their memorandum to the Russian Government (8th April, 1914). While, therefore, the British group of the Societe d’Etudes in no way depart from the views which I had the honour of laying before you on the 8th May, they are willing, in deference to the wishes of their French and Russian associates, to join them in suggesting that attention should be concentrated in the first instance upon the option pure and simple. This would mean that the option would receive immediate official support at Tehran, and that all outstanding questions of arrangements as between the British and Russian Governments and other parties interested would be left for ulterior adjustment within the period of the year subsequent to the option being actually obtained.

Having studied this document, and having exchanged views with the other groups of the Societe, the president of the Russian group has now addressed a communication to me, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, from which it will be seen that tne Societe d’Etudes insists on the removal of the restrictive condition contamed^ m paragraph 15 of the memorandum, and on the necessity of immediately entering into communication with the Government of the Shah relative to the grant of an option for all lines and concessions for the construction of a railway in the north. On their part, the Imperial Government regard the wish expressed by tne Societe as fully grounded, and share the opinion that all the questions^ tone e m the memorandum of the London Cabinet can be considered and decided m one sense or another within the period (one year) proposed by the British Government. In view of this, I respectfully request your Excellency to inform your Government that the Imperial Government consider further delay in the question ot seeking an option for the Trans-Persian Railway in general terms and concessions lor t e construction of its northern section within the limits of ^ the Russian zone as inadmissible, and express an earnest desire that the Societe d 11 ® s s . a r! e * + -°p authorised to take the necessary step in Tehran supported by the Russian, British, aild While not Entering at present into a detailed discussion of the above-mentioned memorandum, I consider it necessary to draw your attrition to .

St. Petersburgh, May 23 (June 5), 1914 vtl( ef' THE Societe internationale d’fitudes du Chemin de Fer transpersan had the honour to receive from the British Government a memorandum forwarded to the Russian Government of the question of the Trans-Persian Railway. With reference to the questions raised by this memorandum the Russian group have a series of comments to make, which it will have the honour of submitting to the favourable consideration of your Excellency m the immediate future. Now 7 , as president of the committee of the Russian group, I am addressing the following request to you In accordance with paragraph 11 of the memorandum, the r British Government agree to an immediate support of the request of the Societe d jiludes lespecting the grant to it by the Persian Government of an option for the construction of the railway without a previous settlement in one or another sense of the questions raised in the memorandum, which must be decided within a year from the grant of such optipn. Fully welcoming such decision of the British Government, the Societe d’Etudes, nevertheless, is not permitted to present a request for an option because, by paragraph 15 of the same memorandum, an agreement must be apparently reached between the Societe d’Etudes and the English companies, Kerman Mining Syndicate and the Persian Railways Syndicate, the interests of wdiich are affected in Southern Persia. In view of this, the Societe d’Etudes requested the British group to approach the British Government and to clear up this contradiction between paragraphs 11 and 15 of the memorandum, and it is asking that, in accordance with paragraph 11 of the memorandum, the British Government shall agree to an immediate support of the request for the grant ,of an option on the condition that questions of an agreement between the Societe d’Etudes and the above-named British companies shall be cleared np within a year of the option being granted. Informing you as above, the Societe d’Etudes most respectfully begs your Excellency not to refuse to support its appeal with the British Government, so that it may obtain the desired option without loss of time and may proceed with the construction of at least the northern section of the railway.PARLIAMENTARY NOTICE Session uiiU- c: r '7 W i SV Date. 4 ' T.

Colonel YATE asked the Secretary &lt;6f State for Foreign Affairs whether, .eorsidering that the main object 'of the proposed Trans-Persian railway is Oral Answers. 848 to secure through overland communi cation between Europe and India, the option which His Majesty’s Govern ment are considering for a line of railways in Persia, connecting with the Russian railways in the north and ending m Persian territory at or near the sea in the south, will provide for this line being commenced simultaneously at both ends ; and whether the construction from the south end northwards will be carried out on an Indian gauge and the construction from the north end southwards on a Russian gauge, so that when the question of linking up with Indian railways comes up for consideration there will be no diffi culty in providing that Indian goods shall have the same facilities of entry into Persia from the south without break of gauge that Russian goods will have in the north, and thus of securing equality of treatment for the commerce of both countries l The SECRETARY of STATE for FOR EIGN AFFAIRS (Sir Edward Grey): It is our desire that construction should begin simultaneously at both ends, but we cannot prevent railways from being begun in the sphere of Russian interest or stipulate that none should be begun there before British capital is prepared to make railways from the south. As regards break of gauge the question was con sidered with the Indian Government and for strategic reasons is was held that there should be a break of gauge when this railway entered the sphere of British interest, but for commercial reasons we have not stipulated that there should necessarily be a break of gauge in any railway connecting the north of Persia with the coast; so that Indian goods landed at a port could be carried into any part of Persia without break of gauge. Colonel YATE: May I ask the right hon. Gentleman if commercial interests have equal consideration with strategic interests in this matter l Sir E. GREY : Both interests must have consideration. I should say that where strategic interests are vital they must have precedence of commercial interests, but the object of my answer has been to point out that strategic interests begin to have predominance when the railway enters the British sphere, and until it enters the British sphere it would be against commercial interests to insist upon a break of gauge.

GREY : It is in just the same state as I explained the other day. What is under consideration now is whether the option shall be applied for w^hich will enable surveys to be made for the making of the railway, but the question of whether the railway could be begun has not been settled. The other condi tions will be agreed to subsequent to the option. Colonel YATE: Is it finally settled, then, that goods coming up from India by the railway are not to have entry into neutral spheres of Persia without breaking gauge? Sir E. GREY: No. I said that if they enter at a port outside, on the edge of the sphere of British interest, they- would be able to come into Persia from south to north without break of gauge. Colonel YATE: But those entering by the railway would not be able to Sir E. GREY: The hon. and gallant Gen tleman is raising very hypothetical ques tions. If the railway was subsequently continued to make a junction with the Indian railway, as at present laid down, the condition of the Indian Government is that there should be a break of gauge when it enters the British sphere.

GREY: The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. In reply to the second part, I would refer the hon. and gallant Member to the answers given to him on the 25th May and the 11th instant. All that is under con- , sideration at present is an application for l an option for a railway across Persia. It 0—&amp;-(?-*- O^T-&gt; &gt; i Cm -f y £4-3 /■ A-oA &gt;1 S' /SAsOt*- teL North into Persia without railway access also being provided from the South coast into Persia. This can only be done effec tively by some through communication from the North of Persia to the coast of Persia. It is undesirable that this should be arranged without our participation; it is also undesirable that we should partici pate without conditions as to alignment, gauge, control, and other matters. Colonel YATE : Is it not of equal importance that goods should run into Persia from India as that they should run into the North of Persia from Russia, and therefore is it not desirable that the railway should run through the centre and to the South coast 1 ? Sir E. GREY: Yes, Sir; but the hon. Member’s supplementary question relates to the Trans-Persian railway, which will be linked up with the Indian railways. I have already stated that the question of linking up the Trans-Persian railway with the Indian railways is a separate question and a separate subject upon which state ments will have to be made before it is finally decided upon. I have answered this question on the assumption that it refers only to a Trans-Persian railway beginning and ending in Persian territory. Colonel YATE : Will the hon. Gentle- . man consider the second alternative in connection with the first alternative 1 ? My question was as to a through railway connected right up with India. Sir E. GREY : As I have said, the link ing up is a separate question which must be dealt with at a separate stage. At present we are considering the question of applying for an option for a line of railways which shall end in Persian territory. Colonel YATE : With regard to the second part of the question, it may be too late to raise it after the first has been decided. \Ye want to get right through to the South. Sir E. GREY: That contingency will be borne in mind. It is a very serious matter which requires further considera tion before we are actually committed. Sir J. D. REES: Does the scheme pro vide for going down to the Persian Gulf at or near Bunder Abbas'? Sir E.

With reference to my letter of the 9th nltimo, I have the honour to inform you that the “Memorandum for communication to the Russian Government whicn accompanied your letter of the 8th April, 1914, has been duly brought to the notice of the Societe internationale d’Etudes. A meeting was held in Paris on the 2nd May, at which careful consideration was mven to the general principles, as well as to the points of detail, set for i m _ e Foreign Office memorandum in so far as they affect the interests of the Societe d£t The'comments which the Societe as a whole considers appropriate wiU find expression in a memorandum which is in course of preparation and will shortly be presented to the Foreign Office.

' It will be borne in mind that the Societe d’Etudes was formed for the object f' studying the feasibility of a railway connection between Europe and British India—a scheme which, although perhaps lacking in attraction from a commercial point of view, became one which was obviously entitled to respect when viewed as a contribution to the world’s economy and as a means of co-operation between two Great Powers who were said to be prepared to assure to the Societe their official recognition and support. The Societe had good ground for believing that tbe project was looked upon with approval by the Powers immediately concerned, but it was always understood that the co-operation of the British and Indian Governments, limited as it was known to be by political considerations, would be of a nature to remove the enterprise from the category of those whose aims are entirely utilitarian. It is fair to add that it was felt at the same time that, in proportion as Governmental requirements might lessen the commercial attractions of the project, in such proportion would it be proper and necessary, when the time came, to put forward the claims to which the enterprise might reasonably seem entitled for that financial aid from Governmental sources without which it might not be able to mature. The Societe’s financial advisers, indeed, have lost no opportunity of making it clear that a railway so dependent on Government regulation could not hope, on its own merits, to obtain from British investors the funds necessary for its construction and development. These facts being premised, the Societe d’&amp;udes now find themselves for the first time in a position to survey the full scope of the undertaking in which they are asked to engage. The important question of alignment, seeing that it is still dependent on the Russian Government’s approval, may be set aside for the moment. It will suffice to remark that the selection of a route has been imposed by circumstances beyond the Societe’s control. The other conditions prescribed seem to the British group to be of a nature to place difficulties in the way of the Societe, where privileges and concessions might not unreasonabty have been looked for. The Societe’s business, as the British group see it, is to concentrate its attention on a trans-Persian line of railway ; they have no ambition for amalgamation with syndicates or groups whose aims they do not profess to understand, with whose operations they do not seek to interfere, and about whose vested interests in Persian territory they had no specific knowledge when they were first invited to study the question of a trans-Persian line. Knowing the complexity of the questions involved, the British group have been willing to wait until a trace and conditions satisfactory to their Government could be elaborated by the expert officials to whom the task was entrusted. The trace now indicated, in the choosing of which they have had no voice, and which departs radically from the principle under which the original scheme was conceived, turns out to be hampered by conditions which, if complied with, would transform the Societe’s position from that of a concessionary into that of a conceding party, leaving as they do on the shoulders of the Societe, and resting with special weight on the shoulders of the British group, the whole burden of financing and developing what has all the appearance of being (at any rate in its earlier years) an unprofitable railway. The British group are animated by a sincere desire to meet the situation in a helpful spirit; but they see no prospect of being able to acquiesce in the programme which is indicated in the “ Memorandum for communication to the Russian Government, and they feel that they would not be justified in committing themselves, even in principle, to the serious liabilities which underlie the present proposals. They have therefore authorised me, as already stated, to place the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in possession of the views which I have endeavoured to outline above, and to express their regret that they have not been able to read those parts of the memorandum with which they are directly concerned as furnishing a practical basis for their co-operation.

M Sazonof replied that the proposals now put forward by His Majesty s Govern ment would require to be carefully examined before a reply could be returned to them. He would, however, point out that our attitude with regard to the railway had greatly changed since his visit to England in the autumn of 1912, when he had discussed the question with you and Lord Crewe. We were now bent on converting the original scheme of a direct transit railway into one for the construction of a number of commercial lines, and he would tell me at once that he could never consent to the atoment passing through Ispahan. Such an alignment would inevitably entail the Enking up of the Trans-Persian Railway with the Bagdad Railway, and the latte^and not thf Russian railways, would then secure the direct ^ anslt * rad f ] Vlt L t the neural readily admitting that we had no such aim in view, he contended that ttie natuiai ronseauence of our proposal would be the linking up of the two railways. I assured M Sazonof that there was not the slightest danger of this, a,nd repea e , What iZd already told him more than once, that the natural obstacles in the way of such a linking-up railway were almost insuperable ; and that, moreover, i e ^mans couMconstrimt a' railway' to Ispahan, they con d -^'^Xded^rom alktg was also the Potsdam Agreement, under which &amp;“cellenc? however, maintained for railway concessions in the Russian sphere. k a J’qq l-mrl hpen nroved in that, however difficult the country, the construction ^ ■ the case of the Jungfrau, was merely a question o ^ . f im ds and getting Agreement, Germany would elude P ro ' sl0 “ ^ ^/XrshrwXd /se as a the railway built either by Persia or by ° ^ veto itg construction by man of straw.

There were, he said, several points to which he would have to takpg exception in the written reply which he would send me ; but he added that some wJ§ must be found out of the difficulty. Though still adhering to the views which he had expressed with regard to Ispahan, he no longer met my representations with an unqualified no?i possumus, and he even went so far as to say that Russia might perhaps have to earmark a concession for a railway from Ispahan westwards, so as to prevent such a concession falling into German hands.

As regards the question of consulting t.ae Committee of Imperial Defence, I am to point out that to do so k PR 1S14 £ , would The Under Secretary of State, India Office.( 15991 / 14 ) would, for practical purposes, do little more than recon stitute the original interdepartmental conference, since the Committee of Imperial Defence, apart from the secre tariat , does not constitute a Government Department that car be consulted on current questions^, and can only express an opinion after a meeting has been called at which the various Departments interested are represented. In this case, such a. meeting would naturally be largely composed ol the distinguished officials who have already taken part in the conference at the Foreign Office, and would be mainly influenced by their views as subsequently endorsed oy the Ministers at the head of their respective Departments.

Sir E.

These papers have been submitted to the most serious consideration of His Majesty’s Government, and I am now directed by Sir E. Grey to transmit to you herewith a copy of the memorandum which has been sent to the Russian Government in reply. It is hoped that a study of this paper will enable the Sociefce d’Etudes both to have a clear understanding of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, and also to appreciate the necessity for an agreement between the Societe on the one hand and the Kerman Mining Syndicate and Persian Railways Syndicate on the other. ^ ^ I°am to add that, given concurrence in the wishes ol His Majesty s Government as now set forth and agreement between the Societe and the two syndicates. His Maiesty’s Government concur in the terms of the request for the option enclosed m Lord Errington’s letter referred to above, provided that the last paragraph is modified so as to accord with the considerations brought out in § 8 ol the accompanying memorandum, and that it is further understood that all rights acquired or claimed by the Societe in virtue of the option lapse, if within a year of its presentation to the Persian Government no agreement has been reached between the Brits^h and Russian Governments on the points raised in that communication. {Signed) Eyre A.

[474—3]7. The practical point which seems to call for decision next to the determination of the route is the manner of construction. Taking into consideration the par ticular political circumstances of* the Trans-Persian Railway and the fact that Russian trade penetrates from the north and British trade from the south, the fair and obvious arrangement would be that construction should start simultaneously from both ends and continue, so far as possible, both as regards actual work and provision of funds, pari passu, until the junction. His Majesty’s Government understand, however, that the surveys for the northern part of the line are nearly, if not quite, complete, whereas they possess only a rough preliminary survey of the southern part, and they recognise that they cannot equitably penalise the Societe d’Etudes by insisting that work on the northern section should await the completion of the surveys in the south. If there fore the principle of simultaneous construction from the northern and southern ends be admitted they would be prepared to agree that construction in the north should begin as soon as the survey starts from the south, provided that the northern line shall in no case proceed beyond Tehran until construction has been actually begun on the southern line, its progress northwards assured as regards funds, and the rate of progress sufficiently calculable as to allow of assigning an approximate date for the junction of the two lines. 8. If and when alignment and manner of construction have been agreed upon, it is necessary to settle the question of access to the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Govern ment have noted with great satisfaction that the Russian Government recognise the special interests of Great Britain in this matter by proposing that the management of ports in the south should be exclusively in the hands of the British group of tiie Societe d’Etudes. His Majesty’s Government, for their part, beg the Russian Government to believe that they are fully determined to secure for the Societe, so far as it lies with them, every facility for free outlet to the sea, but they must, at the same time, preserve their other interests in the Gulf, which might be unduly limited or hampered were the control of the ports in the hands of even the British group of the Societe, since the sole concern of that body is the welfare of the railway. His Majesty’s Government would propose that the Soeiete’s application for a port should be made under the express condition of its retrocession to a special company to be formed to work and develop the port, whereon the interests of the Societe and of the important British enterprises in that part of Persia shall hnd adequate representation. 9. These seem to be the three primary questions on which agreement must be reached before the Trans-Persian Railway can come into being. There remain two subsidiary points of a practical order which it is desirable to have settled, and on both of these His Majesty’s Government are happy to be able to meet the wishes of the Russian Government. 10. The first is the question of parity of tariff-rates. If the proposal for simultaneous construction from north and south be adopted, and if the principle of parity of rates be accepted by the Russian Government, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to agree that a detailed settlement on this point may be deferred until there is an immediate prospect of the northern and southern sections being united. 11. The second point is the method of presenting to the Persian Government the formal request lor the option for construction of the railway. Here, too, His Majesty’s Government are ready to agree that the request shall be put forward without delay by the Societd, and subsequently supported by the representatives of Russia, France, and Great Britain at lehran separately, provided that it is recognised that, if within a year from the presentation of the option no settlement on the points raised in this memoran dum is reached, any claims of the Societe d’Etudes to railway construction south of Yezd, in virtue of that option, shall lapse. His Majesty’s Government have, in fact, so informed the Societe, and have expressed their concurrence in the text of the request as drafted by the Societe, subject to a modification of the final paragraph dealing with the control of ports and access to the sea, as explained in paragraph 8 above. 12. It would also seem desirable to take formal note of the fact that the British and Russian Governments agree to representatives of the British and Russian groups of the Societe being attached to the surveys in the north and south respectively. The oiler now made by His Majesty’s Government to accept a definite alignment renders it unnecessary to consider further the question of official representatives of the Russian and British Governments composing, or forming part of, the Survey Commission in the south. 13.

The Russian Government will have noticed that the route in the south which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to accept lies mainly in the neutral zone, and that, therefore, were the principle ol equal rights in the neutral zone laid down in the Russian memorandum of the 1st (14th) May, 1913, to be maintained, British control would be limited to an extent of the line so small as to be in practice completely negligible. Such a position is obviously impossible and entirely beyond the original intention of the Trans-Persian Railway scheme. From the outset His Majesty’s Government have insisted, as a sine qua non, on having a deciding voice in the southern, while leaving to Russia control in the northern, sphere. The natural division would be Russian control from Astara to Yezd, and British control from Yezd to Bunder Abbas. This division should, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, be observed by considering the railway-belt (i.e., the line itself and any mineral zone that may be attached to it) from Yezd to Bunder Abbas as forming part of the British sphere. An alternative method would be to extend the present British sphere from Bunder Abbas westward to include Lino^ah on tbe Persian Gulf, in which case the boundary would run from Ras Bistana (lat. L!6° 30' N., long. 54° 38/ E.) to Mahdiabad and from thence east to its intersection with the line defining the limits of the present British zone. If this alternative be adopted, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to agree to the section of the railway from Yezd to Mahdiabad being regarded as forming part ot the northern section, but they consider that it is essential to them to safeguar aeir interests in Southern Persia by one of these two courses. # 15. If, as His Majesty’s Government earnestly hope, the Russian Government were to find themselves able to accept the various suggestions advanced above, it might seem unnecessary to carry this memorandum any further. But the first result of agreernen would be that the Societe d’Etudes would at once present its request for the option to the Persian Government, and before it can do so there is a practical difficulty which must be discussed and surmounted. . ^ 16. As the Russian Government are aware, H,s Majesty s Government have from the outset made it clear that their support has been pledged to acquired and claimed by the Kerman Mining Syndmate and its alhed S .gPgp.

In conclusion, His’Majesty’s Government trust that the Russian Governmen will realise and appreciate the spirit which has inspired this memorandum. It seeks neither to avoid nor to gloss over those points where political considerations render it impossible for both Governments to see eye to eye ; it is founded on the belief that agreement, if it can he reached, can only be loyal and lasting if those points of dinerence have been clearly realised as factors that must be allowed for, and as constituting the fixed limits within which a working solution is to be found ; hut it represents a sincere and earnest attempt of His Majesty’s Government to go to the utmost limit °t concessions consistent with their view of the essential conditions^ of their political interests, in the hope that the Russian Government, animated by a similar desire, may, by concessions on their side, secure the definite realisation of the Trans-Persian Railway.

Memorandum for communication to the Russian Government. HIS Maiesty’s Government have taken into their most careful consideration the memorandum of the Russian Government of the 12th (25th) February last, respecting the Trans-Persian Railway, and, in reply, submit the following observations 1. The views expressed by the Russian Government as to the prejudice caused to the Societe d’Etudes by the delay in initiating the enterprise are shared by is Majesty’s Government, whose present communication represents a ^ cer ? at ^ ? to reconcile by a substantial modification of their original proposals, the dner^ence of op nhn Ufch have manifested themselves during the drscussmns of the queat-n and thus enable practical effect to be given to the des.re of both Governments to continue in the Trans-Persian Railway, that co-operation which should increasingly mark tlmir relations in Persia. For this reason it is necessary to go beyond ~i:t Kca-tefraT* -??• * “ ca.'ySf general principle of the route of the railway between Astara and /“^but From Astara (o Ispahan ^ ^ that , from Ispahan onwards H s 7 - G° ei nment ^ Bunder Abbas, nor their interests require that the line should ru better route b 0 th politi- SVS dX^er/desire to Snme^t by Ispahan, Ye Z d, and Saidabad, with a branch to Kerman.

[474—3]7. The practical point which seems to call for decision next to the determination of the route is the manner of construction. Taking into consideration the par ticular political circumstances of the Trans-Persian Railway and the fact that Russian trade penetrates from the north and British trade from the south, the fair and obvious arrano-ement would be that construction should start simultaneously from both ends and continue, so far as possible, both as regards actual work and provision of funds pari passu, until the junction. His Majesty’s Government understand, however that the surveys for the northern part of the line are nearly, if not quite, complete, whereas they possess only a rough preliminary survey of the southern part, and they recognise that they cannot equitably penalise the Societe d’Etudes by insisting that work on the northern section should await the completion of the surveys in the south. R there fore the principle of simultaneous construction from the northern and southern ends be admitted they would be prepared to agree that construction in the north should begin as soon as the survey starts from the south, provided that the northern line shall in no case proceed beyond Tehran until construction has been actually begun on the southern line, its progress northwards assured as regards funds, and the rate of progress sufficiently calculable as to allow of assigning an approximate date tor the junction of the two lines. - . . . 8. If and when alignment and manner of construction have been agreed upon, it is necessary to settle the question of access to the Persian Gulf. His Majesty s G-overn- ment have noted with great satisfaction that the Russian Government recognise t e special interests of Great Britain in this matter by proposing that the management of ports in the south should be exclusively in the hands of the British group of toe bocffite d’Etudes. His Majesty’s Government, for their part, beg the Russian Government to believe that they are fully determined to secure for the Societe, so far as it lies with them, every facility for free outlet to the sea, but they must, at the same time, preserve their other interests in the Gulf, which mignt be unduly limiter or ampere were the control of the ports in the hands of even the British group of tne bociete, since the sole concern of that body is the welfare of the railway. His Majesty s Government would propose that the Societes application for a port should be made under the express condition of its retrocession to a special company to be formed to work and develop the port, whereon the interests of the Societe and of the important British enterprises in that part of Persia shall find adequate representation. 9. These seem to be the three primary questions on which agreement must be reached before the Trans-Persian Railway can come into being. There remain two subsidiary points of a practical order which it is desirable to have settled, and on pot of these *His Majesty’s Government are happy to be able to meet the wishes of the Russian Government. ... 10. The first is the question of parity of tariff-rates. If the proposal for simultaneous construction from north and south be adopted, and^ if the principle ot parity of rates be accepted by the Russian Government, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to agree that a detailed settlement on this point may be deferred until there is an immediate prospect of the northern and southern sections being united. _ . , 11. The second point is the method of presenting to the Persian' Government the formal request for the option for-construction of the railway. Here, too, His Majesty’s Government are ready to agree that the request shall be put forward without delay by the Societe, and subsequently supported by the representatives of Russia, France, and Great Britain at Tehran separately, provided that it is recognised that, if within a year from the presentation of the option no settlement on the points raised in this memorain dum is reached, any claims of the Societe d’Etudes to railway construction south of Yezd, in virtue of that option, shall lapse. His Majesty’s Government have, in fact, so informed the Societe, and have expressed their concurrence in the text of the request as drafted by the Societe, subject to a modification of the final paragraph dealing with the control of ports and access to the sea, as explained in paragraph 8 above. 12. It would also seem desirable to take formal note of the fact that the British and Russian Governments agree to representatives of the British and Russian groups of the Society being attached to the surveys in the north and south respectively. The offer now made by His Majesty’s Government to accept a definite alignment renders it unnecessary to consider further the question of official representatives of the Russian and British Governments composing, or forming part of, the Survey Commission in the south. _ . i T 1 13. There still remains one important point which must be settled before the irans-Persian Hallway project can assume a definite form, namely, the question of Hussian and British control in the respective sections of the line. 14. The Bussian Government will have noticed that the route in the south which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to accept lies mainly in the neutral zone, and that, therefore, were the principle of equal rights in the neutral zone laid down in the Bussian memorandum of the 1st (14th) May, 1913, to be maintained, British control would be limited to an extent of the line so small as to be in practice completely negligible. Such a position is obviously impossible and entirely beyond the original intention of the Trans-Persian Bailway scheme. From the outset IBs Majesty s Government have insisted, as a sine qua non, on having a deciding voice in the southern, while leaving to Bussia control in the northern, sphere. The natural division would be Bussian control from Astara to Yezd, and British control from Yezd to Bunder Abbas. This division should, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, be observed by considering tbe railway-belt (i.e., the line itself and any mineral zone that may e attached to it) from Yezd to Bunder Abbas as forming part of the British sphere. An alternative method would be to extend the present British sphere from Bunder Abbas westward to include Lingah on the Persian Gulf, in which case the boundary would run from Bas Bistana (lat. 1!6 0 30' N., long. 54° 38' E.) to Mahdiabad and from thence east to its intersection with the line defining the limits of the present British zone., 11 this alternative be adopted, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to agree to me section of the railway from Yezd to Mahdiabad being regarded as forming part of the northern section, but they consider that it is essential to them to safeguard t interests in Southern Persia by one of these two courses. . p + 15.

(It is of course understood that any mineral rights acquired by the Societd d’fitudes or the Kerman Mining Syndicate are exclusive of oil, the rights to which have already been disposed of by the Persian Government throughout the whole of Southern and Central Persia.) 21. His Majesty’s Government consider that it is also desirable to remind the Russian Government that there have been other railway projects discussed in connection with the Trans-Persian line. They think, therefore, that the opportunity should be taken in this paper, which aims at being a final and complete statement of the position of His Majesty’s Government on the whole subject, to clear up these points as well. 22. The Russian Government are acquainted with the support accorded by His Majesty’s Government to the Persian Railways Syndicate, not only for the Bunder Abbas-Kerman line, dealt with above, but also for lines from Mohammerah to Khoremabad, from Bushire to Shiraz, and from Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz. The Russian Government have in turn expressed the strongest objections to the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz-Ahwaz line, which in their view can only be regarded as designed for a continuation of the Bagdad Railway, and have further, while not raising objections to the other lines, claimed the right to construct, or to share predominantly in the construction of, railways from Ispahan to Shiraz, Ispahan to Ahwaz, Ispahan to Khoremabad, Yezd to Shiraz, and Yezd to Kerman. 23. The last line will now, if the present suggestions are carried out, be merged in the Trans-Persian Railway, but as regards the others, His Majesty’s Government consider that there is scope for both the Russian and British schemes, and they see no insuperable obstacles to, but rather obvious advantages in, those schemes working in co-operation. In their opinion, the first and most important amalgamation would be for the Russian Government to continue the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line to Burujird, Hamadan, and Tehran. 24. As regards the Bagdad Railway, His Majesty’s Government are anxious to dispel in the completest manner possible the supposition entertained by the Russian Government that British railway projects in Persia aim at linking up the Bagdad Railway with India. No such suggestion has ever been under their consideration. 25. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government trust that the Russian Government will realise and appreciate the spirit which has inspired this memorandum. It seeks neither to avoid nor to gloss over those points where political considerations render it impossible for both Governments to see eye to eye ; it is founded on the belief that agreement, if it can be reached, can only be loyal and lasting if those points of difference have been clearly realised as factors that must be allowed for, and as constituting the fixed limits within which a working solution is to be found ; but it represents a sincere and earnest attempt of His Majesty’s Government to go to the utmost limit of concessions consistent with their view of the essential conditions of their political interests, in the hope that the Russian Government, animated by a similar desire, may, by concessions on their side, secure the definite realisation of the Trans-Persian Railway. o[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government] CONFIDENTIAL. m A 'V MEMORANDUM RESPECTING TRANS- PERSIAN RAILWAY. 5 3 of draft Memo randum. CL M. RAFFALOVITCH, the moving spirit of the Russian group of the Societe d Etudes, has been in London this week in order to discuss with Mr. Greenway the possibilities of an arrangement covering the interests of the latter s syndicates and those of the Societe. It is unnecessary to say more on this point than that the ground was sufficiently cleared to allow the hope that a satisfactory settlement was feasible, but advantage was taken of M. Raffalo- vitch’s presence in London to ascertain his view of the reply which His Majesty’s Government are about to make to the Russian Government on the whole question of the Trans-Persian Railway. There are four points in that reply on which he suggested important modifications, as he feared that without something of the sort the Russian Government would consider it useless to endeavour to make further efforts to overcome our, in their opinion, non-possumus attitude, and would devote themselves to developing their own railway interests in Northern Persia, leaving the Trans- Persian scheme to die of inanition. M. Raffalovitch speaks with knowledge and authority, and, even allowing for his natural inclination to make the best bargain he can, it is well worth while to consider how far his views on the four points in question can be met. They are as follows :—- 1 That we should avoid any definite statement that Bunder Abbas is, and is to remain for ever, the terminus of the Trans-Persian Railway. M. Raffalovitch realises that it will be so m practice, at least under the present policy of His Majesty’s Government, or until changes in the general political situation lead to the adoption of other views ; but he urges, as a matter of tactics, that the Societe should still be left with thb possibility of eventually prolonging the line; He suggests that the wofding of the memorandum /might be to the effect that His Majesty’s Govern-2 ment cannot agree to the Trans-Persian Railway reaching the sea at any point east of Bunder Abbas, and they therefore propose that the southern section of the line should now stait fro m that place (or the port on the Clarence Straits) northwards, and that any future prolonga tion eastwards shall remain a matter for their consideration and consent. Provided that a formula can be found which gives us the practical result we require and yet leaves to the Societe a vista, faint though it be, of subsequent extension, the adoption of M. Raffalovitch’s suggestion may help our memorandum to find acceptance. 2. That His Majesty’s Government should give § 21 of , . , moral) dum. a definite assurance that there should be no con nection between the Bagdad Railway and any British lines to the east of it. The declaration suggested in the paragraph noted in the margin would seem to give all the assurance necessary or desirable, though no doubt the Russian Government would like to see us contract ourselves for ever out of any connection with the Bagdad system. 3. That the Societe d’fitudes should be § 17 of draft Me- authorised to put forward their request for an option at once, without waiting for Russian agreement to the alignment now proposed by His Majesty’s Government. M. Ralfalovitch pointed out that His Majesty’s Government have already, in October 1912, agreed to the Societe securing the option, and have at the same time formally stated that there is no objection to the Russian Government con structing a line to Tehran. If His Majesty’s Government now go back on that and insist that the request for the option must depend on Russian concurrence in the proposed Yezd- Bahramabad - Saidabad-Ahmadi - Bunder Abbas alignment, the result, apart from the unfortunate impression made on the Russian Government, will be that the Russian group of the Societe will themselves tell the Russian Government that they cannot, in Russian interests, any longer defend a policy of waiting for another year or two years until a settlement is reached on this point, and they propose therefore to dissolve the Societe and devote themselves to railway construction in Northern Persia. There is force in what M. Raffalovitch says, for the prospect of immediate Russian railway morandum./ f X &lt;ot draft Memo nuiduin. construction in the north, joined to steady Russian- opposition to any British railway construction in the neutral zone, is unpleasant. There is, how ever, another side to he considered also. If the option is applied for (and granted) forthwith, while the southern alignment is still the subject of discussion and settlement, the Societe will go ahead with that part of the line which is agreed upon, namely, the northern section. Meanwhile, the negotiations about the south drag on and on, railway development there is held up by the prior rights of the Societe, the railway in the north steadily advances, and British trade is killed. This may be hypothetical, but it is a contingency that should be borne in mind, and, therefore, while recognising the advantage of agreeing to an immediate application for the option, such assent should be accompanied by some proviso that, if no agreement on the various points raised in our memorandum is reached within a year, His Majesty’s Government recover full liberty of action in the south. 4. That the Societe d’fitudes should he autho rised to ask for the terminal port on the Gulf, under the express condition of retroceding it to the special Company to be formed, as suggested in § 8 of the draft memorandum to the Russian Government. If this will please the Societe and thereby facilitate an agreement, there do not appear to be any serious objections to making our proposal m that form. . A copy of the draft memorandum, showing the cfianges in the wording which would follow from adopting M. Raffalovitch’s suggestions, is annexed to this paper. Foreign Office, April 3, 1914s &gt; w-[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] CONFIDENTIAL. TRANS-PERSIAN RAILWAY. 1. AN Interdepartmental Conference was held at the Foreign Office on the 19th instant to consider the reply that should be returned to the Russian Memorandum of the 25th February last. The representatives of the various Government Departments present were :— Admiral Sir S B. Jackson l A a m iralty. Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade J Major-General H. H. Wilson ... War Office. Sir H. Llewellyn Smith ... 1 Board of Trade. Mr. P. Ashley • J The conclusions reached by the Conference-are now submitted for the consideration of His Majestys Govern ment, together with a short explanation of the present position of the Trans-Persian Railway question, in order that the obligations entailed by the adoption ot the reply suggested may be Lilly appreciated. 2. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the military objections of the Government of India, which have been accepted by His Majesty’s Government, to any line terminating east of Bunder Abbas. It is enough to say that they are insuperable, and that the whole scheme must be abandoned if the Russian Government will not oive up their proposal of a line from Astara Reset uw.r.__V avA —ITpirman to Chahbar, and will not agree to Sir A. Nicolson {Chairman) . Sir Eyre Crowe Mr.~G. R. Clerk Sir A. Hirtzel India Office.2 I it to be a practicable route, though undeniably costly. In making this offer to the Russian Government, stress should be laid on our concession in abandoning the Ispahan-Shiraz route and on the fact that the present line goes a very long way to meet Russian wishes. It is not therefore unreasonable to ask that Russia on her side should show equal readiness to His Majesty’s Government. 5. It should be noted that there are incidental advantages in deciding upon a definite alignment ; the expense of alternative surveys is saved, and actual construction can be begun much sooner—in this case, a very important consideration. 6. The Russian attitude is now clearly defined. With or without the Trans-Persian Railway, the Russian Government intend to build railways in their zone, and this means that British trade will be driven out at Persia unless railways are simultaneously started from the south. Not only, therefore, can we not afford to let the Trans-Persian scheme die of inanition, but we must secure that the British end shall be constructed as nearly as possible pari passu with the Russian. Unfortunately the Russian plans are already complete and they could start building to-morrow, while we have nothing beyond Mr. Johns’ rough survey already mentioned. The reply accordingly should stipulate that the principle of simul taneous construction from the two ends of the line should be admitted, which could find practical effect by an agreement that construction shall not begin in the north until the survey starts from the south, and shall in no case proceed beyond Tehran until construction has begun upon the southern line and its progress northwards is assured. 7. The Russian Government hold that, as regards management and control of the railway in the neutral zone, there should be an equal voice for Russian, French, and British interests. Apart from the fact that in this case we should be in a perpetual minority, the line as now proposed runs for by far the greater part through the Russian and neutral zones, and we must therefore clearly insist on our own claim that in the southern section we shall have the deciding voice. The reply should therefore put forward the not un reasonable suggestion that from Yezd southwards the railway zone (assuming it to have the mineral belt for which the Societe d’Etudes have always pressed) shall be considered as forming part of the British sphere, or, alternatively, that the British sphere shall be extended westward to include Lingah on the Persian Gulf, and that the boundary shall run from Ras Bistana (latitude 26° 30' north, longitude 54° 38' east) to Mahdiabad, and from thence east to its intersection with the line defining the limits of the present British zone. The section of the line between Mahdiabad and Yezd—about 50 miles as the crow flies—could be in that case left, as a special concession, under the Russian section. 8. Connected with this question of control is that of break of gauge. The obvious point for this is either at Yezd (if British control runs to that point) or at Mahdiabad. It appears, however, that with the align ment now proposed a break of gauge is no longer considered a strategical necessity, thus giving His Majesty’s Government a further opportunity of meeting Russian wishes.s 9. The latest Russian proposal for the construction and management of ports on the Persian Gulf is that it should be exclusively in the hands of the British group of the Societe d’Etudes. The general view of the Inter departmental Conference is that the terminal and any other ports should be controlled by a separate British company to be formed ad hoc, and the two suggestions do not seem to be wholly incompatible. A British com pany, wherein our various interests in Southern Persia (oil, mining, and shipping) and those of the Societe d’Etudes were all adequately represented, should not be impossible to form, and should provide all necessary .guarantees for harmonious co-operation with the Trans- Persian Railway. 10. The Conference agree that the present Russian proposal for the Societe d’Etudes to put forward direct to the Persian Government their petition for an option for construction of the railway, the petition to be sub sequently supported at Tehran by the representatives ot Russia, Great Britain, and France separately, could be accepted. 11. It is also agreed, subject to the acceptance by Russia of the principle of simultaneous construction from the two ends of the line, that the Russian view as^ to ■deciding on parity of tariff-rate could be met by saying that the question should not be raised until there was an immediate prospect of the northern and southern sections being actually united. 12. To sum up, the conclusions arrived at by the Conference concede to Russia :— (i.) The definite abandonment by His Majesty’s Government of the .Tehran — Ispahan — Shn az — Bunder Abbas route. (ii.) The choice by Plis Majesty’s Government of one specific line, thus saving time and expense lost m surveying alternative routes. (iii.) One gauge throughout from Astara to Bunder -A-bbci s (iv.) The postponement of the question of tariff rates until the railway is completed. ^ jp necessary, extension of Russian control to Mahdiabad, 50 miles beyond the Russian sphere. On the other hand, the Russian Government are asked to give way so far as to agree to . (i.) The Tehran - Yezd - Bahramabad (Kerman) - Kinder Abbas alignment, which, from Kerman onwards, hey have hitherto refused to accept. _ (ii.) Bunder Abbas as the terminal port, to which Key are strongly opposed. ^ r (iii.) The principle of simultaneous construction from ;he north and south. . , . , (iv ) Division of the line, for purposes of control, mto -,wo sections, Russian and British, involving British lontrol over a belt through the neutral sphere, or a lefinite extension of the British sphere. . (v ) A wider British control of the terminal port , v • -A. i~4-^ Kxr latest Russian oroposal. 13 The Conference is of opinion that the suggestions as thev now stand represent the utmost limit of what His Majesty’s Government can safely concede, and those concessions must be dependent upon complete acceptance of the counter conditions now formulated.14. To bring about an agreement on these lines will not be easy, but if that were all there would at least be a prospect of success. But, unfortunately, there are various complications which affect principally the British part of the railway, and the difficulties of the situation cannot be fairly grasped without a clear understanding of what those complications are. (i.) The advantages of deciding upon one definite alignment have already been noted, but it so happens that the particular route chosen will be very costly to make, and the Societe d’Etudes, who will be called upon to construct and pay for it, may not unnaturally say that it is not the line they would have selected, and they think it only fair that His Majesty’s Government, who have left them no alternative, should help them to bear the extra expense entailed. Such an attitude on the part of the Societe would be logical, and unless His Majesty’s Government are prepared to pay or to agree to another route the whole undertaking may collapse, and Russia be left free to build her railways in the north and drive British trade out of Persia for good. (ii.) The above possibility leads to the consideration of the general financial question. The Trans-Persian Railway is. not likely to attract the ordinary investor without some guarantee. Such a guarantee cannot be found by the Persian Government without the support of Great Britain and Russia. The latter may be expected to be ready enough, and His Majesty’s Government should consider in advance what their attitude will be in such a case. (iii.) The Yezd-Bahramabad-Bunder Abbas align ment enters the area of the Kerman Mining Syndicate s claim at Mahdiabad, and goes through the centre of it to within about 3.5 miles of Bunder Abbas, where the limit of the claim is reached. Now the Kerman Mining Syndicate and their allied group, the Persian Railways Syndicate, have, as the Russian Government have been consistently informed, the pledged support of His Majesty’s Government in their claims, which include all mining rights except for oil in the area known as the Kerman Mining Concessions and the right to build a railway from Bunder Abbas to Kerman. The Societe d’Etudes have from the outset held that the Trans-Persian Railway should receive mineral rights over a belt of land on each side of the line, and there is. thus a double negotiation to be carried out between the Societe d’Etudes and the Green way group (the two syndicates just mentioned)—one for mining rights and one for settlement of claims to railway construction. Certain preliminary steps to this end have already been taken, and the Greenway group have shown them selves disposed to be conciliatory, but their position, supported as it has been by the assurances of His Majesty’s Government, is a strong one, and the question arises whether it is possible to return any definite reply to the Russian Government until a settlement between Mr. Green way and the Societe d’Etudes has been reached, or whether the reply should not take the form of a communication to the Soci^t4 d’Etudes, setting forth the conditions of His Majesty’s Government, and leaving their final assent dependent on agreement between the Societe and Mr. Greenway. (iv.) His Majesty’s Government have kept the5 Russian Government aware of their support of the Persian Railways Syndicate not onlyfor the Bunder Abbas- Kerman line, but also for lines from Mohammerah to Khoremabad, from Busbire via Aliabad, to a point to be determined subsequently (this Aliabad east - south - east of Bushire, near Jahrum, must not be confused with the Aliabad shown on the map north of Shiraz), and from Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz. Russia has replied by expressing the strongest objections to the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz-Ahwaz line, which could in her view only be regarded as designed for a continuation of the Bagdad Railway, and, while not objecting to the other lines, has claimed the right to construct railways from Ispahan to Shiraz, Ispahan to Ahwaz, Ispahan to Khorem abad, Yezd to Shiraz, and Yezd to Kerman. The last line will now be merged in the Trans-Persian Railway, but the question arises whether His Majesty s Government are now to recognise, explicitly or tacilly, the Russian veto on the Bunder Abbas-Ahwaz line, and to accept the Russian claim to construct the other lines specified. This may seem to be travelling outside the scope of the Trans-Persian Railway discussion, but these questions have been linked to the negotiations throughout and it would be dangerous to leave them now on one side still undetermined. The occasion should also be used to dispel, or try to dispel, the Russian “ idee fixe that British railway projects in Persia aim at linking up the Bagdad Railway with India. „ x ,, The best and most suitable method to effect these two obiects would seem to be to refer, in the reply o the Russian Government, to these projected railways outside the Trans-Persian Railway : to say that Mis Maiesty’s Government consider that there is scope for both Russian and British schemes, and that there are no insuperable obstacles to, but rather obvious advantages in such schemes working m co-operation, and that t e first and most important amalgamation y ould be ’ 11 the Russian Government would continue the Mo ham merah-Khoremabad line to Burujird, Hamadan, and Tehran. It is for future consideration whether, in the event of Russia raising serious objection to the railway lines in Southern Persia contemplated by the Persian Railways Syndicate on the ground that such lines mig &gt; connect 7 with the Bagdad Railway system His Majesty s Government might not give some formal assurance to the Russian Government that such connection is not mtended a^ from anj , deman a by the Societe d’&amp;udes or the British section thereof for financial guarantees it may be expected with some confidence that the LueL for the option of the Trans-Persian Railway will meet with the'reply from the Peman Gove— that their assent depends upon the grant of an adequate loan. It is not necessary at this moment 0 g difficult subject, but the contingency must be borne mind for Bnssi, will, in all probability, press strongly for according the loan, while, Persia being h loan can be made without control which will ra^etehe whole question of the future policy oi His Maj v . Government in Persia. 404 [404] Gmmrnemm e [9143] Annex 1. Draft of Despatch from Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (No. Sir, (No. .) Sir, Foreign Office ,, 19J4.

I am, &amp;c. Annex 3. Draft Memorandum for communication to the Russian Government. HIS Majesty’s Government have taken into their most careful consideration the memorandum of the Russian Government of the 12th (25th) February last, respecting the Trans-Persian Railway', and, in reply, submit the following observations :— 1. The views expressed by the Russian Government as to the prejudice caused to the Societe d’Etudes by the delay in initiating the enterprise are shared by His Majesty’s Government, whose present communication represents a sincere attempt to reconcile, by a substantial modification of their original proposals, the divergences of opinion which have manifested themselves during the discussions of the question, and thus enable practical effect to be given to the desire of both Governments to continue, in the Trans-Persian Railway, that co-operation which should increasingly mark their relations in Persia. For this reason it is necessary to go beyond the specific points dealt with in the Russian memorandum of the 12th (25th) February, in order that the ground may, if the views now set forth are accepted, be cleared for an immediate beginning of active work on the enterprise. 2. It is obvious that the first point which calls for definite settlement is the general principle of the route of the railway between Astara and the Persian Gulf. From Astara to Ispahan there is practical agreement as to the line to be followed, but from Ispahan onwards His Majesty’s Government have hitherto maintained that their interests require that the line should run via Shiraz to Bunder Abbas, nor can they conceal their sincere conviction that this is the better route, both politically and commercially. They do, however, desire to afford a practical proof of their friendly relations with the Russian Government, and they are therefore prepared to give way on this point and to ag-ree to an alignment by Ispahan, Yezd, and Saidabad, with a branch to Kerman. 3. On the other hand, His Majesty s Government must firmly adhere to the principle laid down by them from the beginning, that the Persian terminus of the line mnst net be east ef Bunder Abbas Trans-Persian Raihvay must reach the Gulf at Bunder Abbas or to the8 west of that town. They do not share the practical j objections noted by the Russian Government, m their memorandum of the 1st (14th) May, 1913, to the choice of that jiartiettla? town Thindev Abbas itself as a toninnal | port, but they hope that surveys which are now being carried out in the neighbourhood will dispose of this point by proving that a suitable site, free from those objections, exists a few miles to the west. 4. There are thus, between Ispahan and the Persian Gulf, two definite limitations which must be respected, it the Trans-Persian Railway is to take living shape : one, that it cannot go by Shiraz, and the other, that it must reach the Persian Gulf at Bunder Abbas or west of that port. His Majesty’s Government accordingly now pro pose the following definite alignment : Ispahan—Yezd— Anar—Bahramabad (with a short branch line of / 0 miles to Kerman)-Saida bad-Ahmadi-Bunder Abbts, or the port on Clarence Straits, which the surveys already alluded to may show to be more suitable, with the reservation that the question of continuing the line east from Bunder Abbas shall form the subject of future consideration by His Majesty Government and shall m no case be undertaken without their express ^ consent. Such a route corresponds with Russian views in full as far as Herman, and His Majesty’s Government feel that they may fairly ask that the British standpoint as to connection between Kerman and the Gulf should be accepted. _ . 5. The Russian Government will notice that by their present proposal His Majesty’s Government abandon their previous condition that they will not commit them selves to any definite alignment in the south until alternative routes have been surveyed and their respective military and political advantages or dis advantages taken into consideration. They have been induced to take this course mainly by the representations of the Russian Government as to the undesirability, on the score both of expense, and of time, of insisting on surveys of different routes. 6. His Majesty’s Government are also prepared, if the alignment now proposed is accepted, to agree to there being one gauge throughout from Astara to Bunder Abbas. 7. The practical point which seems to call for decision next to the determination of the route is the manner of construction. Taking into consideration the parti cular political circumstances of the Trans-Persian Railway and the fact that Russian trade penetrates from the north and British trade from the south, the fair and obvious arrangement would be that construction should start simultaneously from both ends and continue, so far as possible, both as regards actual work and provision of funds, pari passu, until the junction. His Majesty’s Government understand, however, that the surveys for the northern part of the line are nearly, if not quite, complete, whereas they possess only a rough preliminary survey of the southern part, and they recognise that they cannot equitably penalise the Societe d’Etudes by insisting that work on the northern section should await the completion of the surveys in the south. If therefore the principle of simultaneous construction from the northern and southern ends be admitted they would be prepared to agree that construction in the north should begin as scoifas the survey starts from the south, provided that9 the northern line shall in no case proceed beyond Tehran ’until construction has been actually begun on the southern line, its progress northwards assured as regards funds, and the rate of progress sufficiently calculable as to allow of assigning an approximate date for the junction of the two lines. 8. If and when alignment and manner of construction have been agreed upon, it is necessary to settle the question of access to the Persian Gulf His Majesty’s Government have noted with great satisfaction that the Russian Government recognise the special interests of Great Britain in this matter by proposing that the management of ports in the south should be exclusively in the hands of the British group of the Society d’Etudes, this Majesty’s Government, for their part, beg the Russian Government to believe that they are fully determined to secure for the Societe, so far as it lies with them, every facility for free outlet to the sea, but they must, at the same time, preserve their other interests in the Gulf, which might be unduly limited or hampered were the control of the ports in the hands of even the British group of the Societe, since the sole concern of that body is the welfare of the railway. His Majesty’s Government would propose that the Societe s application for a port should be made under the express condition of its retrocession to a special company sheaM to be formed to work and develop the terminal port of the railway, whereon the interests of the Societe and of the im- jportant British enterprises in that part of Persia sheald \ 4 hall find adequate representation. 9. These seem to be the three primary questions on which agreement must be reached before the Trans- Persian Bail way can come into being. Ihere remain two subsidiary points of a practical order which it is desirable to have settled, and on both of these His Majesty s Government are happy to be able to meet the wishes of the Russian Government. 10. The first is the question of parity of tariff-rates. If the proposal lor simultaneous construction from north and south be adopted, and if the principle of parity of rates be accepted by the Russian Government, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to agree that a detailed settlement on this point may be deferred until there is an immediate prospect of the northern and southern sections being united. 11. The second point is the method of presenting to the Persian Government the formal request lor the option for construction of the railway. Here, too, His Majesty’s Government are ready to agree that the 1 request shall be put forward without delay by the Societe, and subsequently supported by the representa tives of Russia, France, and Great Britain at lehran separately, provided that it is recognised that, if wit in a year from the presentation of the option no settlement on the points raised in this memorandum is reached, any claims of the Societe d'Etudes to railway construction south of Yezd, in virtue of that option, shall lapse. Mis Majesty’s Government have, in fact, so informed the Societe, and have expressed their concurrence m the text of the request as drafted by the Society, subject to 1 e emi&amp;bieHr modification of the final paragraph dealing wit 1 the control of ports and access to the sea, eieee matter will separate Hegetiatienj as explained m paia- «raph 8 above. [404] I)12. It would also seem desirable to take formal note of the fact that the British and Russian Governments agree to representatives of the British and Russian groups of the Societe being attached to the surveys in the north and south respectively. The offer now made hv His Majesty’s Government to accept a definite align ment renders it unnecessary to consider further the question of official representatives of the Russian and British Governments composing, or forming part of, the Survey Oommission in the south. 13. There still remains one important point which must be settled before the Trans-Persian Railway project can assume a definite form, namely, the question of Russian and British control in the respective sections of the line. 14. The Russian Government will have noticed that the route in the south which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to accept lies mainly in the neutral zone, and that, therefore, were the principle of equal rights in the neutral zone laid down in the Russian memo randum of the 1st (14th) May. 1913, to be maintained, British control would be limited to an extent of the line so small as to be in practice completely negligible. Such a position is obviously impossible and entirely beyond the original intention of the Trans- Persian Railway scheme. From the outset His Majesty’s Government have insisted, as a sine qua non, on having a deciding voice in the southern, while leaving to Russia control in the northern, sphere. The natural division would be Russian control from Astara to Yezd, and British control from Yezd to Bunder Abbas. This division should, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, be observed by considering the railway-belt (i.e., the line itself and any mineral zone that may be attached to it) from Yezd to Bunder Abbas as forming part of the British sphere. An alternative method would be to extend the present British sphere from Bunder Abbas westward to include Lingah on the Persian Gulf, in which case the boundary would run from Ras Bistana flat. 26° SO 7 N., long. 54° 38' E.) to Mahdiabad and from thence east to its intersection with the line defining the limits of the present British zone. If this alternative be adopted, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to agree to the section of the railway from Yezd to Mahdiabad being regarded as forming part of the northern section, but they consider that it is essential to them to safeguard their interests in Southern Persia by one of these two courses. 15. If, as His Majesty’s Government earnestly hope, the Russian Government were to find themselves able to accept the various suggestions advanced above, it might seem unnecessary to carry this memorandum any further. But the first result of agreement would be that the Societe d’Etudes would at once present its request for the option to the Persian Government, and before it can do so there is a practical difficulty which must be discussed and surmounted. 16. As the Russian Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government have from the outset made it clear that their support has been pledged to the legitimate interests acquired and claimed by the Kerman Mining Syndicate and its allied group, the Persian Railways Syndicate, and have throughout insisted that the fusion11 of those interests with the Societe d’Etudes,or co-operation between the two groups, is an essential preliminary to the construction of the southern section of the Trans-Persian Railway. The alignment now proposed for that railway runs, from Mahdiabad to within about 35 miles of Bunder Abbas, through the centre of the area claimed for the Kerman Mining Concession, and will further clash with the Persian Railway Syndicate’s option for a line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman. On the other hand, the Society d’Ptudes hold that the Trans-Pei's!an Railway should receive mineral rights over a belt of land on each side of the line. There is thus a double negotiation to be carried out, one for mining rights and one for settlement of claims to railway construction. 17 Certain preliminary steps to this end have already been taken, and the Green way group (the two Syndicates above mentioned) have shown themselves prepared to be conciliatory, and His Majesty’s Government trust that a discussion between the group and the delegate whom, as they understand, the Societe propose to send to London for the purpose may lead to a satisfactory settlement. nst-il tk&amp;fe result has beeu aekieveh -His Majesty e Hevernffletit eeasMer that it is useless te preseat the request fer the eptieu. 18. A copy of this memorandum is being com municated direct to the Societe, in order to facilitate an early opening of negotiations between the Societe and the Greenway group, and it may be useful briefly to outline now the main points upon which the latter ask to receive satisfactory assurances. They are as follows :— 19. Taking as a basis the suggestion of the Russian Government, in their memorandum of the 13 th (26th) February last, that the belt of land necessary to the Trans-Persian Railway should be measured off for it on both sides of the route, along its whole length, on the condition that the Society binds itself to grant the Kerman Mining Syndicate a certain share in the working of any mineral wealth which may subsequently be found in the belt, the Syndicate would make their acceptance dependent on : — (i.) Protection for the interests of the Persian Railways Syndicate, or their fusion, on reasonable terms, with those of the Trans-Persian Railway. _ (ii.) That the particular mining deposits which the Mining Syndicate have always had m view should be excepted from joint working, even if found to exist within the railway belt. These deposits are few m number, and His Majesty’s Government are prepaied to ask the Syndicate to indicate to them beforehand Their situation' and area, so as to safeguard tbe Hiterests of the Socidte from any increase of the Syndicates demands when the route is actually determined. (iii) Assurance of adequate facilities for conveying the Syndicate’s mineral products, &amp;c on the railway and for their despatch from the port of shipment. (iv ) Russian support for, or at least cessation of opposition to, the immediate grant of the Kerman Mining Concession by the Persian Government. •20 (It is of course understood that any mineral ricrhts acquired by the Socidte d’Etudes or the Kerman Mining Syndicate are exclusive of oil, the rights to wine iV 12 liave already been disposed of by the Persian Government throughout the whole of Southern and Central Persia.) 21. His Majesty’s Government consider that it is also desirable to remind the Pussian Government that there have been other railway projects discussed in connection with the Trans-Persian line. They think, therefore, that the opportunity should be taken in this paper, which aims at being a final and complete statement of the position of His Majesty’s Government on the whole subject, to clear up these points as well. 22. The Pussian Government are acquainted with the support accorded by His Majesty’s Government to the Persian Pailw T ays Syndicate, not only for the Bunder Abbas-Kerman line, dealt with above, but also for line&amp; from Mohammerah to Khoremabad, from Bushire to Shiraz, and from Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz. The Pussian Government have in turn expressed the strongest objections to the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz-Ahwaz line, which in their view can only be regarded as designed for a continuation of the Bagdad Pailway, and have further, while not raising objections to the other lines, claimed the right to construct, or to share pre dominantly in the construction of, railways from Ispahan to Shiraz, Ispahan to Ahwaz, Ispahan to Khoremabad, Yezd to Shiraz, and Tezd to Kerman. 23. The last line will now, if the present suggestions are carried out, be merged in the Trans-Persian Pailway, but as regards the others, His Majesty’s Government consider that there is scope for both the Pussian and British schemes, and they see no insuperable obstacles to, but rather obvious advantages in, those schemes working in co-operation. In their opinion, the first and most important amalgamation would be for the Pussian Government to continue the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line to Burujird, Hamadan, and Tehran. 24. As regards the Bagdad Railway, His Majesty’s Government are anxious to dispel in the completes! manner possible the supposition entertained by the Russian Government that British railway projects in Persia aim at linking up the Bagdad Railway with India. No such suggestion has ever been under their con sideration. 25. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government trust that the Pussian Government will realise and appreciate the spirit which has inspired this memorandum. It seeks neither to avoid nor to gloss over those points where political considerations render it impossible for both Governments to see eye to eye ; it is founded on the belief that agreement, if it can be reached, can only be loyal and lasting if those points of difference have been clearly realised as factors that must be allowed for, and as constituting the fixed limits within which a working solution is to be found ; but it represents a sincere and earnest attempt of His Majesty’s Government to go to the utmost limit of concessions consistent with their view of the essential conditions of their political interests, in the hope that the Pussian Government, animated by a similar desire, may, by concessions on their side, secure the definite realisation of the Trans- Persian Railway.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100032671578.0x000002_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/416/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100032671578.0x000002</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/416/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 4045/1913 'Pt 2 Trans-Persian Railway'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1914/1916</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-05-04T14:05:42</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (76 folios)</extent><extent>Papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.
