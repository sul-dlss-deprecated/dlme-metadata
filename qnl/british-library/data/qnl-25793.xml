Letters written from Germans ' including: Austrians, Czechs and Poles) continue to give accounts showing the two different points of view of internal conditions (ref. para. 1 of Summary Do. 1 dated 10 November) in Germany. It is noticeable that of late most of the letters -n praise of the Hitler regime and containing all sorts of accusations against Germany’s enemies were written by women, young and old. It may be that their menfolk are mobilised, or otherwise too occupied to have time for private correspondence. Letters relating the miserable condition of the country were almost entirely - during the period under review - from men - Jews, Czechs and the like. One woman from Berlin writes, on 18 October advising her compatriot (female) in Cairo, “to rest calmly with confidence in Germany”. Another, an Armenian by birth, but married to a German, says, “Do not believe the lies which are tcld over the whole world regarding Germany. People have confidence in their Fuehrer, who knows what he is doing and why he is doing it. Little by little the people of the world are coming to understand it and the Fuehrer’s speeches will have their effect'. Still another writes enthusias tically in support of Hitler and condemns the British in the strong est of terms. She says that a male acquaintance (Kleinberger) 'had to present himself at once, though he is not yet at the front'. This woman has at any rate the courage of her convictions for she states that she is going through a course in order to fit herself for war-work. Two women, one from Munich and one from Gorlitz, make the most vehement attacks on the Poles. One says, 'the Poles have been torturing Germans in Poland, piercing their eyes with pins and cutting off their hands. The population (polish) is so bestial'. The other refers to, 'the miserable and perverted Poles, their Government fled in the moment of danger'. 2 . Y/riting from a town in Foravia, on 11 October a certain Kosova states, 'All the shops are closed. There is nothing to buy, not even with ration cards. Six dekagrams of butter per person per week and 20 dekagrams of sugar. There are no shoes or stockings in fact there is absolutely nothing. I still have a few potatoes. I am not able to kill our own pig, because it is forbidden to kill for less than five persons in the house. Our censorship as well as yours opens letters'. A woman evidently on a visit to Sweden, writes, 'I hope you feel sorry for me in our terrible state of war. I am at present in Sweden for fourteen days but must go back to Germany soon, and to the front as 2 Red Gross Sister. Every night I cry with horror, so grey is the outlook. We live worse than beasts. No one has control of their nerves any longer, and one sees a spy in every fellow creature. Please do not discuss war with me - I /amam really not responsible for such stupidity. I have a premoni tion that I will not live through all this.” jc W jgh doctor.- writing from abroad to c German doctor in Switzerland eta toe, : Tho main Thing 2 c •0 nope- that later we will live in happiness in our common fatherland (Germany). We are making plans already'. a letter 'npperdix *** ) from a German-Swiss oculist in Switzerland to his daughter in A] ex^/idria gives an interesting analysis of Germany r s position as seen Irom over the border. 3. P r 0 n a tr a n d 'v , \ c ' 11 F a letter ^Appendix ’E■' ) from s German subject living in Canton (China) - the letter is signed 'Andreas n on3y, but the envelope bears the name of the firm, 'Kunst Albers, Canton' - to a lady in WiIhelmshaven, urges the lady and her (?) husband 'co trav el out to China vi a J' eme 1 , I&lt;atv ia , Rusens and Manchuku 0 , ^wliere they will be met, 'by one of my officers' at Haibin.^ From Harbin the narty is recommended to proceed to Canton via Dairen and thence by boat to Canton. Trie writer goes on to say, 'I am just as much at w-r here as you axe in Germany. I fight here for German- Japanese friendship. At can certainly nou oe a ma^cer cl indif ference to us whether Japan is our friend or helps our enemies. 1. It appears that 'Andreas' gave up his appointment with the Chinese in order to be able to assist the Japanese. IL' may be that lie was on the German Military Mission with the Chinese Government, &lt;*nd is now serving as an instructor with the Japanese Army, hence the expression, 'one of my officers'. 4 . Merchant ShMgggrg. Reference para. 1A of Summary Ho. 1 a letter from the Lloyd Triestino Company’s iff ice at Mas sawn gives a full list of the German merchant ships lying in Italian Mast African ports on 30th October. They are:-- At Massuwa. Coburg, Oder, Crsfeld. Oliva, Bertram Hickmers. Warte.ni els, Frauenf els , Li e chtenf els , Lisbenfels At Assab. Ge ra. At Kismayu . Uckermark, Tannenfels, Ascari, Kionga. A telegram, dated 10 Fovember from the firm of Gellatly Hankey and Co. of I-iiartoum to the Salvage Association in London states that the Captain of the S.3. Liebenfels, lying at Faseuw^ refuses to discharge any of the ship’s cargo as he says the ship s voyage is not ended. Only on instructions from his owners, the / Hansa Line in Bremen, will he transfer cargo. nlso the port authorities at Massawa refuse to allow any transhipment of such cargoes unless the port of shipment, the port of destination and the consignees are all neutral. 5. Germans In terned a cro ad . The International Committee of the Red Cross at Geneva, writing to their representative in Fgypt, Georges Vaucher, on 21 October, say that the German Government attaches particular importance to ascertaining the whereabouts of the father of Reichs- Mnister Hess who is believed to be interned in Egypt. Actually M. Hess, senior, left Egypt shortly before Egypt broke off relations with Germany. Therefore, if he is not back in Germany, under the protection of his son, it may be Surmised that he is not such a keen and enthusiastic Nazi as his offspring. /COHDITIONoCONDITIONS IN NTUTRAL COUNTHITS. 6 .

He relates 'around Trieste there is a large minority population, almost a million people who under Italian ’protection’ have neither schools nor even the right to live. Strangely enough they are pro-Hitlerites, at least they are anti-Easeists and anti-Mussolini to the mari ow of their bones. Your Uncle Micek has recently returned from Trieste. He is very pessimistic about the war and thinks it will last for three years. He says that in these days it is difficult to dis tinguish between friends and foes. They say that in Germany it is forbidden to weep for those who have fallen in the war, or even to wear mourning.' 8 .

Germany is making increased, efforts to obtain cotton supplies from Egypt. Various channels of communication are utilised, one of the principal being through the firm of Francesco Parisi in Trieste and Genoa, which firm is known to be rorwarding goods to and from Germany 0 Other business concerns in Roumania, Bulgaria, Switzerland and Hungary keep up a continuous postal and telegraphic correspondence with various cotton exporters in rgyp and the'Sudan. The Societe Hongro-Egyptienne pour la Commerce, in Budapest, and their representatives in Egypt, Polnauer &amp; c oy»? are particularly under suspicion. It is noteworthy that M. Por- nauor is Consul-General for Hungary in Alexandria and therefore may bo considered to have certain facilities for avoiding censor ship control. A significant fact is that an increasing number of _ ^ enquiries about cotton transactions are coming from Talinn. Iw is probable that since Esthonia has been obliged to give way to u.o,b 0 H. pressure Germany may bo seeking to develop that route as a means of furnishing herself with some of hop necessary importo. Referring to cotton, one of the members of the Pinto cotton firm in Alexandria, writing from Lausanne on 19th October to his brother in Egypt, says, ’’Italy will do everything possible to remain out of tho conflict and thinks of doing business -not only with France, but on a large scale 0 A grave fact, which is not known, is that England has stopped four steamers (tv/o Italian; at Gibraltar because they were carrying cotton.

Oil The Italian snipping firm ’'Adriatica 1 ' wri ting from their heo&lt;d office at Trieste, on 17-oh October to their Alexandria agency, complain that their instructions for rescueling the 'Murco Polo , and others of their ships, are not carried out. They insist that these ships must be re-fueled with the maximum quantity of fuel oi 3 . whenever they call c*'t Alexandria. ihis is obviously one of the many ways by which Italy hopes to maintain her oil stocks in Italy. 17 . Tiad i ng with the Lnemy . Telegraphing from Budapest in November the firm Cable Works Ltd c inquire whether Worms dc Co- of Port Said can transport rubber to Bratislava via Yugoslavian or Italian harbours. This savours very much of trading with the enemy and the ca»~le w^s accordingly suppressed. a forwarding agent in Germany writes, on 21st October, giving details of various consignments lying at Trieste and awaiting shipment to Egypt, also of other consignments awaiting despatch^ from Germany. All goods mentioned are for the firm of Sadnsoui in Egypt and are to be forwarded through Paris! of Trieste. The forwarding agent maintains that he is in complete ignorance us to. whether German goods may enter Egypt or not.

EVASIONS OF CLE 10KSHIP , 18. Particular attention is being paid at ports in Egypt to the evasion of censorship by passengers and crews of ships in port, also to other channels by which written information may be conveyed out of the country other than by post. It was found, at the end of October, that a package sent by Simon Artz in Port Said to a cus tomer in Aden contained a film testing apparatus in which was a piece of film as a 'sample' to test the machine. This sample piece of film shows ships either in convoy or at anchor «t what appears to oe Gibraltar. HOSTILE ^BaB aGEETS . P 9 # Writing from an address in Switzerland on 26 October, 19 39, the notorious pro-German Druse agitator, Shekib Arslan sends a letter to Magdi Bassil, secretary to the Rector of the ^Agypti-n University in Cairo. In his letter (Appendix n D ) Shekib .nisl^n j-ffex-e negotiations about armies being withdrawn from frontiers. These 'negotiations' may have had something to do with recent re ports in the press that Egypt and Italy had cone to c^n agreement to reduce their respective forces in the vicinity of the Egyptian- Libyan frontier. Shekib nrslan mentions two other 'matters' which he is’’working on'- as the original letter was released oy the cen^r it will be interesting to see what Massif, if his reply can be intercepted, has to say about them. It is obvious from another passage in ^rslan’s letter that Massif is hoping to be engaged ’’for important work' on the s.me kind of activities as those that /Shekib(2 Shekilo Arslan engages in. It will also be noted that the strict censorship carried out in Egypt seems to cause dismay in some quaiteis. Other letters from Germany and neutral countries repeat edly complain about the strict censorship to which mails are sub jected :\:n Egypt* ^ Marhar (appendix r, E r ) f el Sh.awi, a native of Iraq, writes a long letter ‘on: jp-dr'na to Younis Baharj, ths notorious Iraqi who broadcasts in .Arabic fro:: Berlin. The letter includes ful- minations against the British and against Kuri Said Pasha, Prime Minister of Iraq, who us described as ’’the servant of the English'. It also discusses r.rab co-operation with Germany against British interests in the Middle East and India, It is believed that when Mtzhar el Shawi arrived in Medina the Governor of that city was instructed not to allow him (liazhar) to use the diplomatic bag for his correspondence. He was to send his letters through the ordin ary mai 1 . another .Arab, writing under the name of Dr, Mahmud Saleh, ar. and described as a journalist with an address at P.O,Box 244, Hamburg, issued a pamphlet from Germany, which contains a virulent attack on Britain ana appeals to the Egyptians to, .get rid of their enemies, the British. n number of these pamphlets was sent to Sheikh -Abdulla al Mczru al Najdi in the Hedjaz, the package being marked 'In transit via Italy'. Ho doubt many copies of this propaganda pamphlet - which, while blaming the British for all the troubles of the Egyptians,points out that, 'Germany his never occupied Egypt, nor any Arab country' - will come to light in Egypt and other nejghbouring countries. The pamphlet bears the title, BEgypf in the Political World', MISCELLANEOUS . 20, The following ir. an extract from a letter from Nairobi to a British soldier in Egypt :~ 'Things are not so good down here, local chaps come to our place and they get more than twice as much pay as we do and yet cur chaps have to teach nine out of ten of these people what to 'do. Other forces also - the chaps get called up and they get the rank of sergeant straight away while we poor sods have to carry on.

Most of tnese letters are sent by air mail and arrive sometime before the ship. At present most of the offending letters come from India. M.E.I.C. 18.11.39APPENDIX Language: From: To: ^Oated: French.

GREECE. Public Opinion. Fully 75 '»of Greek public opinion as revealed by ^nis mail is pro-Ally and hostile to Germany. Borne antifascist feelm * is shown, particularly against dussolim personally. .nere i less anxiety as to the immediate future and the Iwlo Cu .ek agrlement gives rise to the hone that Greece will be able to remain neutral. The belief is frequently expressed,^thc-t^the^r^ country ^ill have little to xear, h,o lo n 0 c. sud-oort of the British Government. Economic. There is a general rise in the cost of living and compiaints of extreme poverty in villages. There are^now three meatless d y rer week in Greece. Dice and sugar are dnficult to ootain, h latter is rationed and in some of the islands is unobtainable. Business is generally reported as bad and commerce heavily hit by the war. This is accentuated by the insistance oi k^ek bankfon thl opening of credit in Greece for all ^oasewortea n nc i the necessity for obtaining export licences, ^rly reported that the export of tobacco to Germany had ceased but the letters dated 13th October reported conclusion of other agreement with Germany under the clearing system. are ° ' evidences of cooperation with German trade interests. ihe number of letters to and from Germany transmitted through accomodation addresses in Greece shows a marked increase, a number ox ee ^ firms are offering to supply goods of German manufacture. ihcre have been enquiries for largo quantities 01 eoMTiodities, e.g.. 10 000 sacks of coffee, 2,000 tons 01 beans, 1,500 tons 01 sugar and 90 000 tors of rice. Such large quantities seem m excess ox Greek requirements and it is noted that much of this merchandise ?s required for shipment to Salonika, whereas goods destined for Greece are normally shipped to the Piraeus.

The demohilisation of certain classes has been announced hut no date has yet been fixed. Sh r ITZS:lLMD. Pub lie Op i,nip n. ^ Much anxiety is revealed in this mail. There is a general fear of Germany but some writers say that neither side can be trusted to respect Swiss neutrality in an emergency. Italy is not viewed in a very friendly light. There is marked hostility to Nazism, so much so that some German Swiss now prefer to call themselves Suisses Allomanicjues, instead cf Suisses Allemancis as formerly. Many letters say that Hitler’s word is utterly un trustworthy and there arc scathing references to him in nearly « . . • &lt; i i _ j. j. t x ^ ^ -P 4-*U all private lette: Some Swiss fear that the fate of their country may be that of Poland, but they express determination to defend their country against all attack and the majority of of writers express confidence in the final victory oi the f-llies. Economic. There are complaints of diminution in trade owing to shortage of staff through mobilization, shortage of raw materials and rise of the Swiss exchange. T his has led to an increase of unemployment Flour, sugar, butter are rationed and retail prices are estimated to have risen from 13 - SOy. White bread is difficult to obtain and black is generally eaten. Benzine is strictly rationed and almost unobtainable lor private use. Mil itary.. Swiss forces are concentrated on the frontiers at war strength* BELGIUM, Public Opinion. Public opinion in Belgium appears generally favourable to^ the Allies. Writers hope that Belgium will be able to keep out of the war but there is little confidence in this. v ery fev/ comments as to the merits of the Allied cause but much anti-Naz feeling. There is general support for the policy of the King, and a neutrality benevolent to the Allies is generally hoped fo Hitler’s speech in the Reichstag is described as full of mis representations and arrogance. One letter reports that Belgium is infested with spies and several people express fear that the war may last five years. i Economic. There are complaints of shortage of raw materials with resultant delay in delivery. Production is restricted by mobilization. Belgian firms refuse to accept payment in confirmed sterling and most demand irrevocable credit in Belgian francs. All credit in the export trade is stopped. Several Belgian firms . attempt to find markets for German goods either openly or disguise#, as Belgian manufactures^ The Government has prohibited the exporo ' 'vn * “fn . .J _ x - ~ .. x /ofof cotton, jute or rutTber.

Much Arrival of many Polish refugees stimulated Hopes that Turkey will remain neutral but general Confidence in her ability to defend herself. Some apprehension as to Russian designs on Constantinople. C-reat confi dene ■ anti-Gerraan feeling, ant i -German feel mg. A letter from Smyrna states that the town has become a fortress. In the event of hostilities the whole civil population would be evacuated to the Interior. Only Italian and Roumanian ships are now serving Turkish'ports, resulting in stagnation of export trade. Most of the correspondence from Turkey comes from Christian and Jewish writers. HOLLAE D. Dutch commerce suffering as the Dutch export trade handled many goods of German manufacture. Practically no expressions of opinion in the earlier dated mail, but later letters evince considerable anxiety as to future developments in Holland, and some consider the position of the country as precarious. Hxport of t x&gt; butter is prohibited. superphosphate, paper, cheese and cocoa ROUHAHIA . Reports of military preparations on the Russiar.-Roumanian frontier. Some anxiety as to a possible Russian invasion and at the influx of thousands of Polish refugees. No opinions as to either Allies or Germany, interest being local only. ALBANIA. Albanians continue to resent Italian occupation and the export of food stuffs to Italy. Mention of large concentrations of Italian troops at Pogradec (this is a town on Lake Ohrida which separates part of Yugoslavia from Albania.) It is my opinion that as all the countries reported upon have no Censorship in operation (other than the Rxchnnce Control Censor ship in Greece) opinion expressed in letters is likely to be a bette index than the press. Correspondents let themselves go, whereas in most countries today the press is either controlled or guided into defined channels, or chary of expressing downright opinions as is the habit of the average letter-writer.

The Arabic Speaker, G- Broadca&amp;tlng Station, P «C«,Bo- ! -03, Berlin, Bated: 2nd Kama/dan 1B53 (15th October 195©) e rman W o I. My dear and intimate brother Younis Bey. I salute you warmly and ask for your news although every day we hear eagerly your melodious and enthusiastic voice. We are glad and proud of the service you are rendering to your fellow countrymen, the Arab-speaking peoples. You have nothing to be proud of in that, as it is really your uu^y and the duty of every true Arab like yourself. Anyhow, I congratulate you, and I do again congratulate you, on your airival in Germany, and on its magniiicent success - at the head of whose Government is the leader whom God preserves (The FUHKER Herr Hitler). - The really honest and sincere man who has given to mankind the loftiest example in trutnfulness, manhood, ability, etc. May God the Almighty give him all success as he is the lever of the Arabs. I ask God to lead him to the right path and make him embrace the religion of Islam and fill his heart with true faith, for the sake of the most excellent of mankind (meaning Mohammed the Prophet). This is not impossible to God - so that the name of Islam and the Arabs may stand high. But this is only by the way. I am now at Medi na-el-Menawara, performing the rites of prayer near the Tomb of the Apostle (prayers and salutations of God may be upon him) and give to the poor and needy of what God has given me . I am the guest of H.M. the Imam and August Sovereign, that genuine Arab, Abdel nziz A1 Seoud, the inheritor of wisdom and ancient royalty, the preserver of the habits of the Arabs. May God the Almighty support him by His victory. I ask God to enlarge his teiritory, and make his word the /highest .highest ever dll the iir&amp;'bic-speaking nations, and may the unity their word he in his mind, as he is worthy of this. I have no doubt my friend agrees with me. that the whole Arabic world is in the greatest need of this. I have with me 12 men of my tribe, to serve me. I also have 3 drivers, for I have a lorry to carry my effects, as well as two cars - all belonging to me. I left the land of my fathers and forefathers all of a sudden for obligatory and sudden reasons connected with the activity of floury Said, servant of the English. Kis actions are despotic towards me and my relations - inhabitants of the desert. He is capricious and enforces the laws just as he likes. This is treachery, no doubt. Even in the old times of the Turks no such despotic treatment took place against any person. Long live Democracy*. You know that Ogeil the Yawer (n.D.C.) is a servant of the English, and that he came to the fore and won prominence in the days of the English who have aims to realise through him. May God frustrate their hopes everywhere and in call they aim at. Noury meant to strike at me in violation of his own conscience, just to please the English and Ogeil, their servant. By coming into office this session, he struck many on this account, including Aly El-fTasser and his brother Semir (?) whom he con demned to 5 years (?). By the mercy of God he could not get at me, and however sly and deceitful the methods he uses, all are in vain, for, dg you know, my prestige is not like the others*. We left Iraq in the afternoon of the 27th (?) 1939 from Youssofiya with full armament and reached the Seoudi frontiers. When we saw the good habits still observed in these places, we became joyful and forgot the fatigue of the journey, and almost forgot the deeds of Noury, servant of the English, as says ray brother Younis when he broadcasts Barbarous deeds. I have a man with me, one of the sons of the true and zealous patriot, /Sheikh ..Shejkh Slwani ^l-Shallal, head of the Soomhi (?) tribe, to whom history bears evidence that he was the first rebel against the English in the blessed rebellion. Tne bheikh sent him with me out of pity and brotherly care. Ke is my fellow-worker in all my activities, and all of us are guests of the Wekil of the Emir of Medina by the order of Kis Majesty. In fact we have been received with all welcome, honour and extreme respect. This is all becoming to that great house, and not to be wondered at. I may say that 5 or 6 of the most distinguished of my ancestors had friendly relations and tribal allowances with the ancestors of H.M. the Imam and King Abdel Aziz Al Seoud, to which the history of the two families bears witness. Two of ray forefathers were captured by the Turks and crucified in Mardine and their graves are still to be found - as a result of their helping the Seoudis. You know that the Shawiya tribe were of grejt influence at that time, and helped Secudi in an important affair which I cannot now describe in detail owing to lack of space. Slanderers intrigued against them and two of them were executed. On the other hand, Al Seoud did many more favours to the Shawiya tribe. The Shammar tribe invaded Al- Goweiha, the centre of our tribes called El Abeed, of whom El-Shawiya was one . There came to Al-Seoud one of the Shawiya as I do now, with the difference that I am on motor cars and he was on camels with his servants. When he arrived they gave him thousands of Mardoufs (a mardouf means a person (?) on a camel) and supplied them with gifts. They all went to Iraq and drove the Sharnmir away from Al-Goweiha (or Al-Howeiga), the dwelling place of our tribes El Abeed. They are still living in it under the protection of Seoudi and it is situated in Lewa Karkouk. Now, Ogeil el Yawer desires to lay his hands on the Howeiga, as he and Noury are servants of the English and by a hint from their masters they meant to crush me. M*y God /crush *.crush them all, 1 'or no real oppcser and adventurer besides me is found. We used to be two oppcsers; they killed one whom you know, the late Sheikh Omass el Ola, head of the Abeed tribe. There was killed on the same day, as a revenge# the uncle of Ogeil el Yawer, Feisal the joyful. They were not able to get at me despite their efforts and the approval of Noury. I had to leave the land of my fathers, to which I have moie right than any other owing to the great services rendered to it uy my forefathers who sacrificed everything in serving it as history bears witness. Ify own services rendered tc it in paiticulai and to all the -arabs and Islam in general are- known to my brother Younis and aie recognised by the public. I have been three sessions h&gt;.P. and did not spend a single Dinar of my salary but offered it all to the Aircraft Society and to schools and benevolent societies, and for the help cf Palestine. Not only this, but I paid hundreds of Dinars from my own money. I can say that no MoP. in the world has ever offered his salary during three sessions with much from his own pocket as I did. Such deeds deserve praise, reward, appreciation and mentioning with pride, not the con trary. Put this is only in the eyes of men who are true and sincere patriots. It is a shame that such services should be the cause of ray leaving the land of my forefathers. I left it, my brother Younis, for two reasons: first, I did not like to be the cause of spreading fire in the country, and secondly, I could not bear to be humiliated by Noury. I therefore preferred tc take refuge with the Imam and Ping Abdel Aziz Al Seoud, for he is a true Ping and a true ^rab, and appreciates families rightly especially in view of the relations and ties I referred to above. Ify brother Younis knows well that I am not in need of money or a post, ox anything of the kind, neither do I need to make my name and family famous. What I do needis simply to maintodii prestige and honour and to serve the .Arabs in particular and Islam in general. However great ana proud a person may be, he is not ashamed of being obe dient to a Head or hi.ng rhc is worthy such as the Imam -ubdel riZiz Seoud. He, as y ou kncAV, beloi.gs to an honourable family, and wisdom and royalty is inherited by him. Owing to his honourable behaviour, it is the duty of every patriot to help this dear King by every possible means - to put one’s hand in his and g o ahead tr us ting in God . I am definitely determined on this and may God give us success, !£/ letter is rather long because I wish to let you know the situation. I inform you thwct I have instructed my regent at Baghdad, who has full powers to act for me, to go to the house of Aly HI Kaeser and his brother Semir(?) secretly, without the knowledge of any person even their relatives, your uncles, amd pay them whatever they want of money, food,etc. So you need not bother in any way about this. Also please let me know what you want and I am prepared to do whatever you require from Medina. By brother Ycunis, I know your zeal and enthusiasm about your country and people, and here is the opportunity for serving them. The Apostle (prayers and peace of God may be upon him) ordered us to seize opportunities which fly past like clouds. Ho such opportunity ever arises in tens of centuries. Owing to the present political situation in Hurcpe and the inclination of. the great Geiraan Government to help the Arabs, you should speak the matter over with the men of that Government and make with them a useful arrangement. I have at my disposal my tribe which number twenty thousand men, all of whom are obedient to me and their leaders have sworn the oath of allegiance to me . I have also many impor tant friends, heads of tribes in all parts of Iraq who followvfly opinion. And you knov/ that I am adventurous and powerful (power be to God alone). So, after obtaining their approval, write to me in detail at Medina, letting me know what way I should follow, for they are more experienced and more acquainted with the methods of defeating the English (word illegible, perhaps meaning display or show up the English). The object of cur step is a true service to the Arabs and Islam and, particularly, Iraq. You know better than anybody else that our brothers the Iraqis are zealous and brave people, whether the masses lawyers oi Ulemas, except a cursed group, including a few who are office-worshipers and servants of the English. These lead a luxurious life with their wives, while the majority of the people labour and toil and pay taxes into the Treasury to enable the others to spend lavishly with no service to their country. They care for nothing except to secure their future. They have become owners of great buildings, splendid motor curs, accounts with the Banks, and titles. Most of them are outsiders: Turks and what not. Now is the. opportune time, and you should not allow the opportunity to escape. I am prepared to spend all I possess, money and property, in the service oi the Arabs, Islam and Iraq. Let me be like Abu Bakr el Saddik (though far from being like him) who spent all his money to strengthen the religion of Islam and sacrificed everything retaining nothing except one mantle, though even the tethers of his horses used to be of gold and his wealth incalculable. And you know well that I have no aim except piestige and honour and true service, God is my witness. You may ask to interview the Fiihrer personally and come to an understanding with him about this matter. You know better than I do what is the best thing to be done, but you must do all you can and by all means possible. In view of the invasion of Poland by Germany, the pact with Bussia, the peace between Russia and Japan, etc. /the ..the trend will be towards India, ctnd the road to it will ^necessarily be through Iran, Iraq and Afghan. Public opinion in India is eagerly expecting this, r-s to the Imam, King Abdel Azjz A.l-Secud, I hat e not yet seen him, nor have I talked to any cl his Princes or to any human being at all about this matter, There is only mediation on the part of the Imam in my case, and you must be sure that I shall not make a single movement until I receive a detailed letter from you about the whole matter and everything else; and I am patiently waiting for your answer. Fy dear Ycunis, If my letter reaches you in Ramadan, you may try to change the time of your broadcasting as it coincide with the evening prayers and the Moslems are eager to hear you and are torn between the two alternatives. It usually takes place at 1.50 hrs. (Arabic). There is at Medina a man, an intimate friend of mine and an obliging person, named Sayed Aly El-Sayed Amran Kubcubi, a well known merchant, born in Medina. He asked me repeatedly to convey his greetings to you. Yours sincere brother, Sgd. Mazhar SI-Shawi. Dated the 2nd of Ramadan 15th October 1939. P*S. You have broadcasted my (our) subscription to Palestine lately as being 40 Dinars while it was in fact 50 Dinars Mazhar.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002c3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/320</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002c3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/320</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 7715/39 'Middle East Intelligence Centre: Anglo Egyptian Censorship; information summaries'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-01-30T22:33:18</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (17 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 19; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This summary, compiled by the Middle East Intelligence Centre, uses information received through Anglo-Egyptian censorship to provide a picture of various subjects relating to Nazi Germany including:Germany.
