Important. 857. Addressed political Resident, repeated Bahrein, copy to India Toy mail. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. have let me Rnow informally that they understand that statements are Being made in Bahrein to the effect that the Sheikh considers that the recent message from H.M.G. (my express letter of 25th April, P.Z.2067) means that H.M.G. are instructing him to give a concession for the whole of the Unallotted Area to the Bahrein Petroleum Company and that hut for this he might still consider a different course. 2. If suggestions are in fact Being made that H.M.G. have given instructions to the Sheikh they are of course Based on mis apprehensions which it would seem desirable to remove. At this end I am informing P.C.3. of the facts, namely, that Sheikh, after long negotiations with the two Companies and careful consideration of all the aspects came to the conclusion that the interests of Bahrein would Be Best served By accepting the offer of the 3.P.C. for the whole area (including the Hawar Islands). His Highness addressed a considered letter to the Political Agent in this sense, informing H.i .G. accordingly, while adding that Before making a final decision he wished to avail himself of the offer of advice which at the commencement of the negotiations trey had said that they would Be prepared to offer on their conclusion. H.M.G. on receiving this communication decided that there w r as no reason to advise the Sheikh in any contrary to his own views arrived at after such careful consideration of his interests. They accordingly informed His Highness that, on certain conditions in regard to detail, they were prepared to approve his proposal to give the whole of his concession/2 . concession to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. It is evident from the above that no pressure has been brought to bear on the Sheikh, and I presume that His highness himself is not under any misapprehension, as to attitude of ’i.... •. which, as frequently explained has been that he should be left free to decide the question in accordance with his view of Bahrein interests.P.Z.2997/39 Cypher telegram from Secretary of State uo political Resident in Persian Gulf ? repeated to Political Apent, Bahrein, dated 12th Kay, 1939, number of words 151 + 151.

Following is the situation 6th May subsequent to Ashraf meeting with Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah (brother of Ruler of Bahrain). Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah states that Sh* lirh of Bahrain has told Family that he considers recent verbal message to him from British Government to mean that British Government are instructing him to give all unallotted areas to Bahrain Petroleum Company. Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah states that he has pointed out toBahrain Petroleum Company and Family that thie la contrary to original message that Shaikh of Bahrain was free to dispose of areas as he pleased and is pressing Shaikh of Bahrain to ask Political Agent Bahrain for the new message in writing. Consider Bel grave has convinced Shaikh of Bahrain that it is in his best interests to close with Bahrain Petroleum Company Y s offer and attitude of Political Agent indicates to Shaikh of Bahrain that it is not necessary for him to take into account the factor that .n)r-t3 T-iur«rr—i iiiw 11 i' ' 111 ■ *. British Government might privately wish him to giv# preference to a British Company. —— - -— &gt;. Remains therefor# for Belgrave and Shaikh of Bahrain to overcome possible opposition by other members of Ruling Family. There are some indications that the first brother Shaikh Mohammed is already working for Belgrave. It would seem that the only factor remaining in P.C.L. *s favour is the many personal assurances by the Shaikh of Bahrain and members of Family. As regards these little reliance can be placed on Shaikh of Bahrain if the proposal to give Bahrain Petroleum Company the whole area were submitted to India Office with his full knowledge and approval. Politioal Agent Bahrain unofficially puts forward the theory that Shaikh of Bahrain in making such a promise was taking the line of least resistance in the hope of avoiding unpleasantness as far as possible.

Packer previously sunming up of situation seems oorreot with following additions. From Bel grave gathered that Bahrain Petroleum Company’s and P.C.L.’s offers were put to India Office with Shaikh of Bahrain’s views which in effect appear to have been armaments supporting proposal to give Bahrain Petroleum Company all unallotted areas. Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah states that Ruling Family understood that Bahrain Petroleum Company’s and P.C.L.’s offers were forwarded for India Office view only and neither his views nor proposal were discussed or approved by them for despatch with the offer were seem reasonable assumption that view and proposal if any were Bel grave »e possibly with the knowledge of the Shaikh of Bahrain who did not realise degree of finality which would be attached to them in London. C.D. Bel grave states that Political Agent Bahrain informed him verbally that India Office concurred with the view put to them on the disposal of the unallotted area and eventually agreed that Political Agent Bahrain had conveyed to him and the Shaikh of Bahrain directly and verbally that India Office had no objection Shaikh of Bahrain’s proposal to give the whole to Bahrain Petroleum Company. Ruling Family sews prepared to dispute assumption that Shaikh of Bahrain and themselves jointly ever proposed to give the concession to Bahrain Petroleum Company and as a first step are demanding to see India Office oomniinioatioa in writing. C.D. Bel grave is very obviously determined to bring Shaikh of Bahrain and the Family round to his view privately admitted his aim was to ensure Bahrain Island’s future revenues and undo mistake of allowing free import of Arabian oil acknowledged that his difficulty was that Shaikh of Bahrain and Family oould be tempted by ready money.6 ■3 0 C.D. B®!grave’s plan seems to be to overcome opposition by members of Ruling Family by giving them to understand that British Government for some reason wish Bahrain Petroleum Company to take the whole this plan is helped by the strikingly impartial and indifferent attitude displayed by their representative and the form of message emanating from him. Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah for P.C.L. hopes to demonstrate that firstly Ruling Family never agreed to any suoh proposal and secondly they are not now prepared to give concession to Bahrain Petroleum Company unless it is made clear to them that it is British Government’s wish. Belgrave takes view that Ruling Family do not attach mueh importance to their promise to Holmes which should not be taken seriously Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah on the other hand refers to these promises as proof of the sincerity of the Family in their intentions towards P.C.L. Belgrave says next stage to which Ruling Family agree is to get India Office message to Shaikh of Bahrain in writing probably pressed for by Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah this cannot be obtained before 11th of this month. Ruling Family and Belgrade will then meet and discuss after which P.C.L. may expect comnunioation from Shaikh of Bahrain. Belgrave states that no decision would be made by Shaikh of Bahrain and himself alone without discussion with and concurrence of Ruling Family, Situation described above fits in with all sources of information received independently British and Arab.

Cne copy of a summary of the meeting with His Highness the 'haikh on the 5th April. 2. The Agreement ^nd the memorandum were presented to His Highness in 'nglish and Arabic at this meeting on the 5th April. 3. His Highness had oreviously agreed to examine the Agreement and at this meeting he promised to discuss the Company*s offer for the Shoal Area with the Company after a reply had been received from the British lovernmant on the Kawar Concession. 4* The Adviser to the Bahrain Government was present at the meeting and he confirmed that Major Holmes was correct in this interpretation of His Highness* 3 promise.remorandum for presentation to His Highness the taler at a meeting on 5th April 1939 with the object of making clear to His Highness the unusual conditions th^t are attached to submerged areas in conducting geological examinations, oros- pecting and developing. ;nd to point out that methods that are routine on land have to be modified when operating on submerged areas. Also to assure His Highness that the Com pany is desirous of developing the ”3hoal Area” with the least possible delay. atsssssasaissrsEsssssisss:—sssasi-sjrssssssssxssssm Your Highness t After Greetings. 1. I have the honour to bring it to your Highness’s notice that during previous meetings v our Highness was good enough to assure me that when the question of the Hawar Islands was settled you would be prepared to consider an off or by my Company for the submerged lands which I propose to refer to as the 'Shoal Area'. 2. A map showing the boundaries of the 'Shoal Area' for which I am applying to Your Highness is attached to the 'Shoal 'Area' draft agreement presented herewith. Vour highness will note that the area is marked on the map in red and is the same as proposed for Petroleum Conces sions Limited in Your Highness’s sug estlons for partition in JUne 1938, less the Hawar Islands Group and its waters. 3. Your Highness will appreciate that prospecting and developing an area - entirely submerged under varying depths of the sea - presents an entirely different problem to that of developing an area on dry solid land. The amount of pre paratory work required to e xplore and develop a submerged area and to provide against storms and rough seas, is botd costly and extensive. The greater part of the preliminary work on the sub merged lands is in addition to that necessary on dry lands end as a consequence the work takes longer to carry out. 4. Your Highness may be interested to hear that each drilling site entails the erection of a heavy platform upon which/-- 2 - whlch to mount the derrick and the drilling machinery. The platform has to be placed - at least 15 feet above the high tide mark - and be supported on some 50 re-inf creed concrete piles, each 40 feet long. The piles have to be driven into the bottom of the sea to a depth of 25 feet. Your Highness will see that much extra work is involved under the conditions described above, therefore a longer time Is necessary to achieve results. Initial and annual payments prior to production, should reasonably be smaller to compen sate for the increased cost of development. 5. Terms submi tted for consideration (a) Payments The payments consi :ered reasonable in the circumstances are shown in appendix H A* to this memorandum. They are less than those offered for Hawar for the reasons explained in preceding paragraphs. (b) Commercial nroduction Your Highness will no'te that in spite of the increased difficulties of production from submerged lands, commercial production has been left at 700 tons (the same as in the Hawar Agreement) with a view to troubling Your Highness with re-discussions as little as possible. (c) Prilling ob ligations Owing to the abnormal conditions which are encountered on submerged lands, particularly in the initial and trial and error’ f period, the Company has allowed 5 years (instead of 4 in the Hawar terns) that is an extra year to cope with the first 4000 feet. Your Harness will doubtless agree that this is reasonable. Apart frorn this extra year drilling obligations are the same as those of the Hawar Agreement which we believe were acceptable to 'our tighnesa. (d) rticle No. 23 in the draft Your Highness^ attention is drawn to Article No.23 in the draft Agreement, the reasons for possible transfer or/-7 / 3- ,rv or arrialgemation may be explained briefly as follows ?~ Your Highness’s v/iah and the Company's aim is to reach commercial production and locate profitable oil fields in the earliest possible time* It may become clear at some stage in the development of the two areas that this result can - In the long run - oest be achieved by concentrating more on one area than on the other for a time* The extent of this concentration and its value in expediting oil production on the desired seal* «®o only be judged as examination and experiment give rise to the more general problems of the best way of exploiting the potential 611-fields* I think Your Highness however will understand that a situation can very easily arise in which it would be to the advantage of all concerned If the Savelopment of the two areas were controlled as one unit. If this were acted upon it would mean that the Companies' personnel, supplies 9 oroperty, services and facilities of whatsoever nature could be freely placed at each Company's disposal, under their own arrange ments* ihio would be convenient for working the defined areas as a whole, whilst maintaining the separate entity of each of the Companies* The object is aa Your Highness will see to hasten the day oil royaltiea commence* 6* Although the Hawar Islands if proved, provide a pro mising field, its area is vary small and its oil deposits may be quite limited and exheusted in a few years* Hawar ulus Shoal ‘rea' however offers a much better chance of developing an oil-field capable of yielding oil over a long period and thereby supplying a ate ;dy revenue for the State of Bahrain. The combined areas also constitute^ a field large enough to justify very apacial attention by my Com^ny even if curtailment or delay on other territories is involved.. * • -4- 7. The Surfjige ll^hta Area The 'Surface sights'* Area as described in the draft Agreement for the 'Shoal Area' (Article No. 1) is a prime necessity as a base from which the activities of the Company can be directed. It would be vary d ifficult • if not Impossible - to develop the oil resources of the 'Shoal Area' without such 'Surface Bights'. I feel sure that Your Highness will appreciate the necessity of the Company being granted such use of the 'Surface Bights' Area which is shown on the attached mapj outlined and scored crosswise in red as described cbove. 8. Should there be any point which Your Highness reoulres further lnformatlon y I am always at Your Highness* s complete disposal. I have the honour to be f Your Highness's most obedient servant.

I find it difficult to believe that His Highness is deliberately repudiating all the promises and assurances he repeatedly made at our meetings during the last four months, and there must be some explanation which I feel may be a misunderstanding as to the mean ing and extent of the designation of the waters as the 'Shoal Area'. Actually there is nothing »new« being put to him as the fact that we were at liberty to pr sent an offer for the 'Waters' at some future date - dependent upon settlement of the Hawar Concession - has been accepted by His Highness throughout the Hawar negotiations. In any case and whatever the cause of His Highnesses appar ent 'change of front' X feel and I tnink you will agree that it is only r asonabie that as the promises and assurances were made to me personally, I should be given an epportunity of an interview with His Highness. My Company will expect me to make every effort lo reach a clear understanding of His Highness’s intentions as regards the waters by direct contact with His Highness. In thes^ circumstances I am addressing a letter to His Highness asking for an interview as soon as convenient, md I trust you will bee your way to facilitate this should His Highness consult you. Before leaving &amp;is u ighness, if he permits, I propose to leave with him a copy of the draft Agreement for the 'Shoal A re a' (W 8 ters) ana an explanatory memorandum both of which His Highness can examine at his pleasur . I think you will agree that the application for the inter view and the presentation of the draft if His Highness wishes to accept it, are both in order and in accordance with my original instructions from my Company which were presumably known and approved by the India Office ? In this connection also I should like to recall to your notice that at my meeting with the Hon’ble the Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf at Basrah at which you were present it was made clear that I should be at full liberty to make contacts with His Highness as I considered necessary to explain my Company’s offers.

Ye received the offer and gave it our consideration then we forwarded it to the British Government with our opinion about the offer and asked for some advice about the matter.

After a fortnight’s delay he came to me and said that he wished to place before His Highness an offer for whet he cslla the 'waters'. He argued that during the previous negotiations His Highness had told him more than cnce that he would have en opportunity to iaake ©n offer for the waters after the offer for the Hawar Islands had been submitted and considered. In point of fact it is argu able that this is true, but certainly everyone here thought that after Holmes had put in his final offer for Hawar he had finished. However I considered it wee impossible, without stirring up a great deal of trouble, to refuse to ascertain His Highness’ wishes, which I accordingly did via Balgrave. ■ 3. His Highness end Shaikhs Mohammel, Abdullah and Jalman were unanimous that they wished to receive no further offers, and His Highness informed me, both through Relgrave and afterwards personally, t at he does not now wish to consider any new offer from Major Holmes, or from any other psrty, for* the whole or for a part of the Unallotted Area.

The outcome has been as I expected, though I should emphasise that I offered no advice whatsoever to His Highness myself. Tours sincerely, Sd/~ H. Weightman.

The/&gt; The resumed negotiations terminated early in February* As a result of them the Sheikh is very averse to any division of the area and has signified his decision to give a concession over the whole of the Unallotted Area» including the territorial waters and the Hawar Islands# to the Bahrein Petroleum Company* The matter has been considered here in consultation with the other Government Departments concerned and we feel bound to accept the Sheikh 1 s conclusions# which he has arrived at after very careful consideration of his interests in the matter* We accordingly now propose to authorise the Political Resident to com:Tunicate to the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government’s approval of his proposal# subject# of course# as regards the Hawar Islands# to the question of sovereignty over the Islands being eventually decided in the Sheikh’s favour* I should like to assure you that all the relevant factors in the case# including the interests of your Company# have been given all possible consideration in reaching a decision in this matter* I should add that as we have not yet informed the Sheikh/m 7^ Sheikh of the decision of His Majesty*s Government» I must ask you to keep this information to yourself for the time ‘being# but in view of our earlier discussion on the subject I felt that it was only right to Inform you in advance of the final upshot of these negotiations* (Sd) S.F.

The Sheikh wishes to give the Hawar Islands as well as the rest to Bahrein Petroleum Company, who may have been rather intransigent in insisting on Hawar (with the tacit threat in the background of reducing production from their existing concession^. But even if they have been unreasonable, we can hardly reargue the matter with them here. It seems desirable to accept the Sheikh's view and not to postpone a decision further, even if Lord Cadman makes further representations. A.s a matter of courtesy, however, we might wait a few days for his reaction to the letter before sending the draft to the Political Resident.(6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp;E.W.Ltd.

As regards the question of sovereignty over the Hawar Group, the Sheikh of Qatar was told that he must put in his rejoinder to the Bahrein counter claim by the end of March, otherwise it would be considered 'time-barred M . It should therefore be possible to get a decision on this question before very long.A* \ ■M.01463/39. 1 r&gt;A/?*7 i U O •/ Military Branch, Admiralty, S.W.1. ^31st March, 1939. 1939 Immediate and Confidentlal* Dear Peel, In reply to your letter No. P.Z.1111/39 dated March 1st, I am now able to give you the views of the Admiralty on the Sheikh of Bahrein’s proposal to grant the concession for the whole of the Unallotted Area, including the Hawar Islands, to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. 2. Our first observation is that the financial terms offered by the Company are in substance not so generous as they may appear to be on the surface. As we understand it, the minimum annual royalty which they are offering to guarantee for the next fifteen years is only about half that already derived from present production in Bahrein, so that provided the existing oil field produces for the next fifteen years at little more than half its present rate, the Company would be able to make up its guarantee without difficulty on the existing field. As no additional payment is offered other than the initial 400,000 rupees for the new fields, the net effect is that, leaving aside the remote possibility of the failure of their present field (when they might in any case be unable to meet their obligations) they pay nothing, beyond a small sum down, for the rights over the Unallotted Area, including the Hawar Islands. 3. We recognise that in any event the Sheikh is unlikely to be much influenced by a simple comparison of/ R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C' India Office, S. W. 1. POL* D ES**. - 1APR1939 INDIA OFFICE\\ Ji, - 2 - Unallotted Area or portions thereof, since he appears to have always in mind the, probably exaggerated, fear that the Bahrein Petroleum Company, in the event of a rebuff, would deliberately cut down their production of oil in Bahrein to the existing minimum royalty figure and supply the balance of refinery requirements from Arabian production- Nevertheless, if you agree with the foregoing analysis of the American Company’s offer, you may consider it desirable, in the Sheikh’s own interest, to make quite certain, through the Resident, that he fully appreciates the position* 4. If, however, it is clear that the Sheikh has made up his mind with his eyes open, the Admiralty agree that he should be allowed to grant the concession for the whole area, including the Hawar Islands, to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. 5. We feel, however, that every endeavour should be made to secure the following conditions:- (a) That, as you suggest in your letter, a caveat should be inserted in the agreement between the Sheikh and the Company in respect to the Sovereignty of the Hawar Islands. (b) That the Company shall enter into a pre-emption agreement to the effect that in the event of a state of national emergency or war (of which H.M. Government shall be the sole judge) H.M. Government shall have the right of pre-emption of all the oil produced or refined by the Company within the Sheikhdom of Bahrein. (c) That the Company should undertake to give a guarantee to H.M. Government to refine, in time of war, a stipulated minimum quantity of crude oil to whatever specification the Admiralty should consider the most suitable for their purposes at the time. 6. We assume that the undertaking of the Company in the agreement as summarised in paragraph 3 1(c) of Weightman*/ p ' t ■ till - 3 - 2067 j Weightman^ express letter No. C/9] c 10 ^ 0 ^. the? 12th February, would he for the refining of tEe stipulated minimuin quantity of Bahrein oil at Bahrein .

I enclose herewith a copy of Political Agent, Bahrain’s Express letter No.c/91-10/U of the 12th February 1939, with enclosures, in which he has dealt fully and clearly with this somewhat complicated matter. 3. Briefly the situation (see paragraph 3 of Weightman's letter) is that the Bahrain Petroleum Company have refused to make an offer .for less territory than the entire Unallotted Area, including Hawar. For this they are prepared to make Payments of two kinds (a) a lump sum down and (b) payments to be made annually from their present oil field in the Leased Area. Taking (a) and (b) together, their terms are considerably more advantageous to the Bahrain Government than those offered by Petroleum Concessions Limited since although under (a) the /latter’s l •fiCi.

In his paragraph 10 Weightraan suns up the effect which would result if His Majesty’s Government were to insist on the Bahrain Government refusing to include Hawar in the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s concession. I agree generally with these views and it seems to me definitely that the only course open to His Majesty’s Government is to permit the Shaikh to include Hawar in the Bahrain Petroleum Company's concession. 6© I am inclined to agree with the first sentence of Weightman’s paragraph 12, see also paragraph 6 of my Express letter No.544-S^J&gt;f 3rd November 1938, and Paragraph 2 of my telegram No o 20 of 9th January. It is possible that if the Shaikh some months ago, before the present negotiations had commenced, had been informed that he could not give Hawar to the Bahrain Petroleum Company which decision he would have J t 0rc ^ *w , then conv ^ yed t0 the latter might then have accepted the t ^ ^ ' position and negotiated accordingly. It is possible, however. that the Company would not have adopted this attitude and in f'ct •) WvC-rJ any case we must take the situation as we find it at present. i 7. I am not in favour ofthe alternative suggested by Weightman towards the end of his paragraph 12, as I think that it would be difficult to give adequate reasons to the Shaikh / ord9 ^ 3 -3- or the Bahrain Petroleum Company why, having obtained Hawar in their concesaion, th^r should not work it. 8.

II. The Bahrain Petroleum Ciwpftny have refused point blank to ;r*akc an offer for Isas than tne entire Unallotted Ar««# III. Petrolcxis Concessions Lissitad have soosklttsd offers for the whole and for the vvarious parts of the Unallottftd rea. Of theae it la only necessary to detail the offer for the iiswftr Islande, and ^the territorial waters of these Islands', as follows i- (a) Hs* 4 lakhs on signature: (b) Hft. 2 lakh« annuftlly for 4 years; (c) He. 6 ; lakhs miniaufls royalty on discovery of oil in eosKoerdiftl quontitiee. ( ^.B . 'Coinsercial uantity 4 is 700 tons daily, equivalent to on annual royalty of appro ximately ift* 9 lakhs). 4* His Highness the shaikh ami his advisers, though genuinely anxious to fell in with the suggestion that Hseer should go to retroleum Concessions LJU^ited, have neverUieless boon/-'3* baeft co&amp;pdlled u&gt; consider ho* tbla waId affect Vaair financial security* They 36® U»«t unlesa Bahrain haa tha incradlbla good fortune to possess two or .nor# distinct oil fields below the staall surface of its possessions (one of which oust be located at Hswar) the net effect of granting a concession to Petroleum Cone ©salons Limited for the 'dm&amp;r Islands is an invitation to bankruptcy* 'hey see and compare the .raarantead effect of the two offers during the ne*t 15 years* w ieh t after excluding the initial lisyment on signature (the sane in both cases) is as follows (1) 'etrsasm. A guarantee of HS* 2 lakhs for three years f after which the CcsRpany are entitled under article 111 of the draft Lease to abandon the concession on six months 1 notice* and would pre sumably do so in the absence of oil indications* Total effective y guarantee its* 6 lakhs* (it) :,*!tra3.3y A guarantee of either (a) fts# 2S5 lakhs, vide 1(c)(1) above, or (b) lakhs under 1(b) (b) only becoacs effective in the unlikely event of production from the present Bahrain field failing to provide for (a)* Prom these figures iaust be deducted the existing guarantee j ffilnimum royalty of Hs* 1 lakhs per tonum or s total of ''s* lakhs for 15 years* The total guarantee is, therefore, at least Hs* 165 lakhs and almost certainly Hs* 262 lakhs. .^* l ff * 1 take no account here also of the larger offers dependent on the discovery of oil in the Unallotted Area* The fantastic difference between the Auarantaud effect in the two cases is due to the simple fact that the Bahrain Petro leum Company possess an oil field already in production, whereas Petroleum/*Conc««*ioa» Liaitad sr« offarlag for on uaaxplorod aroa* 5* It may be acknowledged that the ^oce-otence of Petroleum Conoeealone Llxited* a offer for Havar urould probably not result in the Bahrein Ocvevnm^Kt forfeiting (for imfrievllete purposes) the whole of the auiES guaranteed by the -ahraln Petroleum Cosh pany* e offer; for the Aiaerloan Coiapany are unlikely to reduce production to the existing minimum royalty figure, even though under the teres of their concession they possess the undeniable right to do so. It would not t however, be surprising if they cut back to, say, an annual production of one million barrels, representing roughly Be. 5 lakhs in royalty, as soon as Arabian production is sufficient to supply the balance of Refinery requirements. The latter prospect is no longer remote. 6. Squally it is undeniable that Bahrain will ultimately receive its full royalties on its total oil deposits. But, if Baud! Arabia is as prolific as is expected. It nay be very many years before the ; mar lean Company Is compelled, by the raere necessity of maintaining adequate supplies of ‘''rude r il to the Refinery, to resume Bahrein production on approximately the present scale. An essential factor to bear in mind, it seems to me, in relation to the two considerations stated cbove, is that an Immediate drop in Bahrain production below the point where resultant royalties enable the state to purchase investments, represents oarmonont loss, i.c* in interest. That point is reached, at a rough calculation (which assumes that •is Highness would In no eircu&amp;^t&amp;nees take s»re than one-third of the royaltioa for hi© personal snare) at He. 10 lakhs* 7. ^roa the financial point of view therefore the grant of Rawer to Petroleum Concessions Limited asay be nothing less than disastrous. &lt; ne cannot but sdislre the restraint of His Highness/-&amp;&gt;f i&amp;q -yhstika* 9 l«vur and marvel at th* magnificent loyalty wdicH animatea it. UeverUialeaa I van tore to suggest that It would oa in the last degree impolitic to take advantage of Hie Bighneae 1 personal willingneaa thoa to sacrifice the interests of Bahrain. d. the prcliiainary advice which has been offered in respect of Rawer ie presumably due to the following considerations t~ (a) It is obviously desirable to support the candidature of © Company possessing ccnsidereMe rltiah representa tion both in capital and in personnel* (b) There ©re obvious disadvantages In an American Oil Company operating a concession granted by the Thalkh of Bahrain in an area so closely adjacent to atar, and particularly inasmuch as that area is under formal dispute at the moment between Bahrain and Qatar Cevan though there can be little genuine doubt thrt sovereignty rests with Bahrain). (c) There are also disadvantages in an American Company operating in close proximity to Petroleum Concession# Limited 1 s selected field of enterprise in star* (4) la the past the American Company hae displayed little interest in Hawar aiv3 f as noted in paragraph 3 of your repress letter Ho. c/337 dated tue l&amp;tfc June 1938 1 its own representative In london at one time suggested that Haver should bo granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited* 9. It would seem that an adequate rejoinder exists to each of the above considerations* that is to say t- (a) Ve may do Petroleum Concessions Limited better service if we do not focus the American Company 1 s thoughts on the possibility of damaging the former*s prospects &lt; k (Uv ^Uv' I in the Qmm hintarlaiid ft think the poseibilitlea are c*Lc 4 mU. 1 sufficiently obvious to need no further specification)* (b) fhen once His Majesty 1 a Oovernment award Tlawar to Bahrain, the ihaikh of ©tar is no longer concerned. If by any chance he were to attempt to contest the award by' force he could presumably be Miasuaded* without undue difficulty. (c) greater disadvantage Is involved here than if Petroleum Concessions Limited had obtained © division of the Bahrain LnalloUed Araa — a possibility which has given Ria Majesty 1 # lovern^ent no cause for mis giving. Keferring also to points (b) and (c), it is to be remembered that If Petroleum Concessions Limited obtain the Hawar concession end aubaecuently discover oil/-oil thoro* vho only poo^lblo lino of oxport will bo across tho otop thuo involving a nm oel of dlfficultloa* (d) Any company i« protmobly ontitlod to roviso its outlook bofor® o final locidlon la taken. 10* However tm&lt;sh weight the ergu&amp;anta aet out in the isxsedietely preceding paragraph may carry one way or the other, the eeeence of the existing aituati n is that the Bahrain -Petroleuta 9 offer is made dependent on their obtaining the entire nnellotted Area. This being the caae, and since the detail* of the present aagotiations must inevitably become public property, it la scarcely too ausch to say that the grant of a concession for Hewer to Petro- I leuia Concessions Limited under the advice of Hie ?!a.jesty* e Govern* mtmt will be as disastrous to the prestige &amp;nd position of Hie Majesty 1 s Covemment in -ahrain and in this part of the Gulf general ly as to the Lhaikh end his a :hn inis tret Ion. The prospects of the distant future (that is to say the fact that ultimately Bahrain will receive its full royalties on its oil deposits) carry, no weight in these parts, and it requires little imagination therefore to realise the devastating effect of the almost inevitable cosraent, if lie Hajesty** Government insist on Hewer going to Petroleum Concessions Limited, ■**- n the .British have served their own interests at the cost of 1 million pounds to the Shaikh of Bahrein*. The effect of hostile propaganda, overt end covert, which might be based on such s statement is incalculable* il* In submitting the foregoing remark* I have taken no account of (a) the possibility of oil being found in the Unallotted area, or (b) the offer which the Bahrain Government might obtain from Petroleum Concessions Limited for the whole of the Unallotted Area, if, on Petroleum Concessions Limited*a obtaining dowor, the American Company persisted in their refusal to bid for the balance* I have deliberately excluded (a) since it can et the best be no more than a remote possibility, unjustified by any visible features /«f&amp;tature* such as in Bahrain J«b«l y Va* Dornt.im dom* or the Jetfel Dukhan in atar. -^or cari it he forgotten that the Bahrain retrcleu^i Comi&gt;any aeXected their present concoaeion- al area a« the ttoet promieing part of Bahrain* Certainty that poaaihilit^ could not be taken into aerioua account in assess- ing the values of the present situation* As for (h) one can only ostlaAte on the br*aia of DeV rolaust Conoeeaicna lltited's off ex* for the ''Leased Area iahrala 193 w * Here there la — and can be — ao greater guarantee than the comparatively sdnor sums payable during the period of exploration. 12» As short a tiase age as June last year, it would f I believe| have been possible for the Bahrain lovernnent to make on excellent bargain with the H«?hrain Petroleum Company Limited for the Unallotted Area sinus Dswor, and to grant Kaear to Petroleum Concessions Limited* the progress of this case haa been attended by such radical alteration of circumstineas U*at th^t poasibilitc, r no longer exists* fo bo frank, etroloum Concessions Limited have been gravely ill-advised in the pro- . aecution of their cause; end for the reasons which I h&amp;ve stated above it is no longer possible, without incurring the grovest risk to the prosperity of Bahrain $* 2 d, in direct con sequence, to the future good relations between Lie Majesty's 'DoverJiment and the Bahrain Bhaikhs, to exert pressure to obtain Baw&amp;r for them. I suggest there re?aoina only' one alternative to the approval of the grant of an unrestricted concession t© the Bahrain ’’etrolems Company Limit©'! on the terras which they now offert end th*t Is, while allowing the Bahrain Petroleum Company to obtain a concession for the whole Lii&amp;Xlotted /reo, to insist that no operation® ahall be conducted in Sawar until such time as His Highness the Shaikh, acting on the aLvice cf Hla Majoaty* a 'Davermaent, ^ay/-*»s«» may proaounc# uno^Jaationabla* I do mot specifically u^gc the latter »ui»:cation but It nmy parbapa cos end itself to Flo ttajeaty* ® Oovcmmant for a variety of rooaons* ^ut in that event T t&gt;eg to atreas the need for Hi# Majesty* a Oovernment to lend their aid to Bahrein by explaining aa fully as they siay think fit their objections to the ~ *hr*in Fetrcleuis Coeipany operating at once in Hawar t and by using their influence to ensure* in discussion with the Company*a representatives in London* that there is no reduction in the minimum figures now offered either for royalty or for the 3»hrstin share of the refinery 'throughput'. 13. It is distasteful to b e compelltd to reco^ end the withdrawal of the support hitherto afforded to a partially British Company in its attempts to obtain is footing in Bahrain.

Your Highness v;ill realize from the terms I am offering this morning that it is to my Company’s debt interest tnat commercial production be reached at the earliest possible date, so that tne large annual payments can be met from oil production in the form of toyalties. Until GOi&amp;aerdial production my Company will get no return from their large outlay in annual rental payments* To meet tne large sum of 6^* lahhs commencing at the 5th year, it is essential that every effort be made in the first four years to produce oil, and it is to the Company 1 s advantage t!iat production be comaenced even before this. To ensure early proauction as far as possible, I can assure four Highness that geological and drilling programmes will be prepared to obviate any delay, and work will be pressed forward with maximum seal and energy. A separate subsidiary Bahrain Company will be formed to develop the oil resources of the Hawar area at an early data to a point where steady oil production can be maintained, and its operations, plans and progress can be investigated at any time by lour highness. it is hardly necessary to bring to four highness’s notice tne immense advantages in the future of n&amp;ving two separate revenue producing Companies within your borders.

Abdullah and Sulman, Ihe adviser, Bahrain Government, Major JJrank Holmes, iir* 13 . v. Packer, Mr. K. P. Hurayan, i^dviser's Secretary. Major Holmes began by saying that there was a personal matter which he wished to make clear; he stated that he was representing a company, ana had never posed as representing the British Government; all that he said was on behalf of his company. His Highness replied that he realised this. Major Holmes then explained that his company was an independent company and if His Highness gra- 010 usly granted the concession, a new company would be formed, a branch of the Iraq Petroleum Company, but a separate company. He said that [ his company had a message from the India Office to i/he effect that the India Office were impartial ■ in the matter. His Highness expressed his thanks to the India Uiiice, to Major Holmes and the company. Majpr Holmes referred to a conversation with shaikhs Mohomed, abdullah and Julman and the adviser when he was invited to make an offer for the Hawar group of islands. He said he had so far done nothing in the matter because he wanted more particulars about the situation. He refer- rea to His Highness’s talk with Mr. Bklyros (in June 1938) ana said that after referring to records he gathered that His Highness was pre pared to give Hawar to his company. His Highness interrupted and said that now fresh ! negotiations had started. Major Holmes said he merely wished to remind His Highness about Hawar and the waters and that His Highness had been prepared to give them to his company. He explained that the combination of Hawar and the waters was of greater value than either separately. h His Highness stated that he did not wish to include f( the waters with Hawar. Major Holmes stated that he wished to make a sugges tion and asked if His Highness had fixed on the idea of not combining the two. — 2 —His Highness said he wished to know what Major Holmes would offer for the Hawar group of islands and if he did not make an agreement with the Bahrain Petroleum Company he would then let Major Holmes offer for waters. ^iajor Holmes said he had come to make an offer for the combined area. He said a base at Bahrain was necessary, the area marked on the map (near Budeya). He- offered 5 lakhs instead of 4 lakhs in tne initial payment, commercial quantity to be 1400 tons as before. Bhaikh abdullah asked Major Holmes to make an offer for the Hawar islands only. Major Holmes said he would value them at 50/50 and would offer 3 lakhs (initial payment). The ^uiviser enouired what would be the other obligations ana terms in the offer for Hawar islands only. Major Holmes said the drilling obligations, number of feet per annum, would be as before stated. The adviser suggested that Major Holmes might like to consider the matter and give his reply later. His Highness asked what would be the payment for Hawar islands and what conditions. Major Holmes said that the initial payment would be not less than three lakhs. It was arranged that Major Holmes should reply j within a week. Major Holmes asked if he would be allowed to offer for the waters again. Shaikh Mohomed said that this would be consi dered when the reply about Hawar was received. Major Holmes enquired His Highness’s intention about the waters and was told that His Highness would inform him if he intended giving waters. Shaikh Mohomed and Shaikh Abdullah said that if the waters were to be discussed Major Holmes would be informed. Major Holmes enquired whether this offer was to be the final offer or if he could revise it later.Shaikh Mohomad said the last and final offer would be what Major Holmes should write about terms and conditions but he could rest assured that whatever the Ruler did would be the best and nothing would be done without his being informed. iidviser, Bahrain Government. Major Frank Holmes.Copy of demi-official letter from Major Frank Holmes c/o Messrs* Petroleum Concessions Limited, Bahrain, dated January 25, 1939, addressed to the Adviser, Bahrain Government* Dear Belgrave, iiany thanks for your resume of the meeting with His Highness on the 19th January received today. I left you a copy of our resume made for our records at your office this morning. There are two points in your version to which I should like to draw your attention - the first is a minor one hut the second is important. (1) On page 1 para 6 . You say ’’His Highness interrupted and said that now fresh negotiations had started': this conveys that H.H. was disclaiming anything he had previously conveyed to Mr. Skliros. Our recollection at this stage was that H.H. said that 'you (Major Holmes) are now here for the purpose' (of negotiating) or words to this effect. (2) On page 2 para 1. The wording implies that the 'Bahrain Petroleum Company are to be given first refusal of the waters'. Neither Mr. Packer nor Mr. Ashraf (nor yourself we believe, heard so definite a statement and in fact your own resume vide pubsequent paras 11 , 12 , 13 and 14 of page) makes it abundantly clear that it was His Highness’s intention that Major Holmes should be per mitted to 'discuss' the waters. I am returning 8 copies of your resume. Yours sincerely, Sd/- '^rank Holmes.© 1 Not© on a riveting held at Safchir on Thursday 26th January at which wore presents- His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad Shaikhs Mohoiaed, Abdullah and Sulman, Adviser, Bahrain Government, Major Frank Holmes, Mr. K. V. Packer, Mr* Ashraf, Major Holmes*a Secretary, Adviser’s Secretary. (Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa was detained and did not arrive until towards the end of the meeting) 1. Major Holmes began by saying that he had ins tructions from his company to say that the company wished to offer for the waters, if the othor company could make an offer his company could also offer and ay. 2 . Hia Highness asked Major Holmes to first talk about nmmm and said it was his wish to discuss - Hawar but if he wished to discuss other things later h© would let Major Holmes offer. 3. Major Holmes explained that he was quoting his company’s wishes and it was his duty to do this. Regarding Hawar, it might be necessary to have 5 Ind “to refine irom outside Tor which the company were willing to pay, the oil would probably be from the Trueial coast. 4. 5. 6 . * His Highness said that he wuld consider this matter later, he then referred to the Qatar oil concession. Hia Highness discussed the question of free petrol for his cars and explained that the Bahrain Petroleum Company had at one time given him free petrol but now all petrol was charged for and he had to pay for repairs to his cars. He admitted that there was nothing about this in the concession. K© understood that the Ruler of Qatar was given free petrol. Major Holmes said that the Ruler of Qatar received Ka 10 , 000 /- per annum for petrol or petrol of that value. Major Holmes compared the area of Qatar and Hawar, the latter only 30 sq. miles and the sur* rounding waters not included and mentioned danger from fire to a refinery at Euwar if oil produced on adjacent area. I His Highness agreed to include the surrounding waters, a rough map was produced and discussed and His Highness said that 3 miles of water j around Hawar on the west and all the waters between the islands would be Included. His Highness explained that he had to consider the possibility of the .Bahrain Petroleum Company reducing Bahrain output, at present the royalty waswas 40 laJchs p*?r annum and he wished to guard against any reduotion in revenue. The granting of another concession in Bahrain might cause the Bahrain Petroleum Company to increase import of Arabian oil. He did not want this to happen. Major holmes again spoke about about the waters (not only the waters around Eawar) and said he hoped His Highness would not decide rapidly as his company would pay a good price for this. His Highness reminded Major Holmes that he granted the concession to the Bahrain Petro leum Company only after Major Holmes 1 a company had been unwilling to take up the concession, because their geologists said there was no oil. He assured Major Holmes that he would not decide about waters before letting him know. Major Holmes suggested that His Highness should state what he wanted for Bawar, pay ment and terms, but the suggestion was not acted upon. The Shaikhs again explained that they wished to avoid any loss of revenue which might result from the Bahrain Petroleum Company reducing output. The minimum royalty in the present concession (Be 150,000/-) was mentioned. Major Holmes referred to this as a threat by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and implied that he knew what he would have done to counteract it. He said it was a simple thing and something could be done by the Advisor, Shaikh Mahomed said that Bis Highness was not asking Major Holmes*s opinion because it was a matter in which Major Holmes could do nothing. It was a serious matter. His Highness mentioned the terms of the Qatar concession and said perhaps he would consider similar terms for Hawar. Shaikh Mohomed said though Hawar was smaller than Qatar oil prospects were bettor in Eawar. Major Holmes said that he did hot know the Q^tar terms, but Qatar area was large, he suggested similar terms to those in his company’s previous offer which was for waters as well as Eawar, only initial payment to be three lakhs. The definition of commercial quantity of oil was discussed and also the annual payment^of minimum royalty. Eventually Major Holmes raised the initial payment to four lakhs.Shaikh Sulman pointed out that the moat impor tant matter waa the amount of annual payment#. 18. Shaikh Mohomed said commercial quantity should be 500 tana, there followed a discussion about the possibility of a refinery being built at Hawar in which Major IJolmea said it would be impracticable to build a refinery for less than 1000 tons a day. 3 \ 19, Eis Bighness said that the Bahrain Petroleum Company offered a minimum royalty of 12 § lakhs and Petroleum Concessions Limited need not build a refinery until oil was found. ihe area of the oil producing land in Bahrain was compared to the area of Hawar. The oomzaeroial quantity was again discussed and eventually His Highness agreed to leave it at 700 tons per day. SB, f His Highness then |f a payment of 61 1 [ of 15 years $ woe said that he would agree to r annum for a period IF*oil was found or not, for the Hawar islands and three miles of waters around them. He said this was half the sum oifor^d by the Bali rain Petroleum Company. 21. Major Holmes said that he would have to submit ti o matter to London, he had authority to treat for all the waters and he required two months in which to deal with the matter and* explain it to his board. 22 . The Shaikhs said that Major Holmes could tele graph, the Bahrain Petroleum Company always telegraphed. There was a discussion about the time in which Major Holmes should give a reply. He agreed to telegraph at once and eventually ' Highness said that he would consult the Political Agent about giving Major Holmes one month in which to repay. 23. 24. Major Holmes returned to the question of the waters and pointed out that if a larger area was obtained larger payments would be made. His Highness enquired what tax Petroleum Con cessions Limited would pay on oil Imported to Ilawar if a refinery was made there. ~ There vrai a discussion about refineries elsewhere. Majoi Holmes said he thought it was generally half the royalty* Rationality of labourers was also mentioned, Major Holmes said this point was covered by the draft loase. 25 Before leaving Major Holmes said that it was possible that he could arrange matters by tele- oth ff* riBe bo would hare to to London j * 8 ,* 180 h ® wished to mako an offer for the Whole area. 26. said that he should make an offer first for Hawar. %tAsUJUu4kr(AMj^&gt;, — ■ ADVISER TO THE GOVERNMENT.mar -AS*- sf i r A GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

Davies but the other company had usade a new offer which his Highness was regarding more favourably. He pointed out that there were two matters which His Highness regarded as being of the greatest importance. One matter was that certain areas of land should be excluded from the agreement as in some oases they were used by His Highness for hunting purposes. The other matter was the old question of ensuring that increased import of oil should not reduce the output of Bahrain oil. These two matters were the subject of discussion lasting about four hours. Hventually a formula was arrived at regarding the exclusion areas, that the island of ^, 0 J 8 r-al-^asan ,, &gt; the remainder of Manamah island and Muh&amp;rraq should not be drilled in without permission from His Highness which would not be withheld if the company showed reasonable proof of indications of oil, such per mission to be given without additional payments or obligations. - p, Vo I'. Regarding refining of iirabian oil a formula was discussed to the effect that the figures given, i.e., half the total output of &amp; 0 t 0 u 0 barrels daily should be the lowest figures and the company would do its best to keep the output at a higher amount. Certain other matters were mentioned such as a clause stating that in case of war all places inside the concession area could be usee freely for military defence measures. A revision in the wording of the section regard ing employment of Bahrain subjects was mentioned also a clause referring to right of passage of ships or boats in waters included in the concession.

C&amp;^yt&lt;L Adviser, Bahrain Government.copy Awali, January 12, 1939 C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Ssq., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain Bahrain. cs Dear Sir: Following consideration by my Company of the letter of January 3rd, 1939, signed by Shaikh Mohoraed bin Isa, Shaikh Abdulla bijp Isa, Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad, and yourself, and as a result of further discussions between us, my Company is prepared to amend the offer made in my letter of December 28, 1938, to read as follows, and requests that you advise His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain accordingly. My Company is prepared to pay His Highness the sum of cs. 4,00,000 upon the granting of a concession covering all territory, including territorial seas and the lands submerged under those seas, now under the dominion of His Highness or later acquired by him or his successors within the period covered by my Company^ present Mining Lease, other than that already held by my Company under its present Mining Lease. It is my Company* s intention that its present Mining Lease will be extended to cover the Unallotted Area to which the present offer pertains, such extension to include the following obligations applying specifically to the Un allotted Area: My Company will pursue, with diligence and without unnecessary delay, geological work in the Unallotted Area including structure drilling and geophysical work if neces sary. My Company will drill test wells for oil wherever geological evidence warrants, commencing operations on the first test well not later than 2^ years after the date such Concession is granted, if a favorable area has been found. If oil is discovered, my Company will continue drilling further wells until oil in commercial quantities (daily average of 500 tons produced in accordance with good oilfieldpractice) has been obtained or until the area is no longer deemed favorable# Upon discovery of oil in commercial quan tities my Company will continue drilling within the productive area until the requirements of good oilfield practice have been met, this obligation^ however being subject to suspension during such time as wells then drilled are capable of a total daily average of at least 1,000 tons of oil, produced in accordance with good oilfield practice# In addition to the above obligations applying specifi cally to the Unallotted Area, my Company will also agree to increase its drilling obligation under the present Mining Lease. During the period of one year following the date such Concession is granted, my Company will maintain at least 4 strings of tools in continuous operation within the area co vered by the present Lease. The royalty provisions of Article VII of the present Mining Lease will continue over the larger area and ray Com pany will undertake that the amount received by His Highness in respect of royalties shall not be less than Hs. 12,50,000 per year for a period of 15 years from the date such Conces sion is granted, nor less than Rs. 17,00,000 per year for the same period if oil in commercial quantities is found outside the area &lt;%iready held by my Company iknder its present Mining Lease, providing the wells drilled are capable of pro ducing the equivalent amount of oil in accordance with good oilfield practice and subject to Article IV of the present Mining Lease amended as follows: ,f The Sheik# undertakes to give all the protection in his power to the Company and to their staff and laborers in any part of his territory from thefts, highway robbery, assault, &amp;c. Similarly the Sheikh undertakes to protect all the property of the Company and of their employees which may be exposed to wilful damage or to possible loss by theft.-3- T&lt; If the Company's work is delayed by such events as ' re nien^ioned in oiiis Article or by force majeure either cfcn Bahrein or elsewhere then the period shall be added to the period for which this lease is granted and the annual minimum royalty provided for in this Agreement shall not be payable in respect of such delay. ''Force majeure as used in this Agreement includes the Act of God, vis major^ war, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, fide, storm tidal wave, flood, lightning, explo sion, fire, earthquake, malice or negligence or default of any third party and any other happening (whether solely due to the forces of nature or not) which the Company could not reasonably have foreseen or if they had foreseen, could not reasonably have prevented, averted or controlled . 11 Following the 15 year period, my Company will undertake that the amount received by His Highness in respect of royalties shall not be less than Hs. 3,00,000 per year if oil in commercial quantities has been discovered in the 'Unallotted Area' and Hs. 1,50,000 per year if such oil has not been found, both of these figures being subject to the delay clauses above and the larger being subject to the 'ability to produce' clause as well. Wy Company will also undertake that, for the same 15 year period, not less than one-half the oil processed in the Bahrain refinery up to a total refinery throughput of 20,000 barrels daily, and if oil in commercial quantities is found outside the area laready eld by my Company under it_s present Mining Lease that not less than one-half the oil processed in the Bahrain refinery up to a total refinery throughput of 25,000 barrels daily, shall be oil produced in the territory of Bahrain, provid ing the wells drilled are capable of producing that much oil in accordance with good oilfield practice, and subject to the present# Article XV amended as above.~4- The above mentioned figures are minimum figures and my Company,while it can make no fu*ther guarantee, is pleased to assure His Highness that, in the event this Concession is granted, it has every expectation of being able to maintain the production of ■ ahrain oil at least at a figure approximat ing the present production so long as the wells drilled are 5 capable of producing that much oil in accordance with good oilfield practice. My Company is also prepared to agree that, although they will be included in the area covered by the Concession, my Company will not drill on Umm Nassan Island, nor within the municipal boundaries of Manama and Muharrak, nor in the vicinity of hunting lodges now established on Manama Island, without first obtaining the permission of His Highness. There will of course be no further payment or considerstion in return for these permissions, when granted. In this amended affer, my Company has met all the wishes of His Highness up to the limit of its ability to do so with out jeopardising the economic interests of the Company. It has made an offer for the Unallotted Area in its entirety which guarantees a continuation of income to Bahrain from its oil resources far beyond what it thinks any other Company can possibly make. In addition to these guarantees, my Company has stated what its expectations are as regards the amount of oil it will be in a position to produce from Bahrain if a Concession covering the remainder of His Highness* domain is grafted to it. The strength of such intentions on the part of my Company is well indicated by its past performance in His Highness* territory, wherein it has unfailingly far exceeded its stated obligations. I should like to point out also that the probability of those intentions being fulfilled is further strengthened by the fact that my Company* s markets are rapidly expanding.I believe that His Highness, who has the welfare of Bahrain and his people so much at heart, cannot help but favor this offer over any other which can be made.

Mr. Packer remciahors Mr. Ashraf using the phrase 'friendship does not follow isoney'.

Mr, Davies said that he was sure that his company’s offer must be more advantageous to Bahrain than that of the rival company; he reminded his Highness of the work (hat his com pany had done in Bahrain which far exceeded its agreed obligations and which should entitle the company to preferential treatment: he pointed out that if the area was divided his company’s security would suffer and it would be thought the aosk^iny htxd done someth in* whisk Meelte was displeasing to the Huler of BaErain and he enquired why His Highness suddenly contemplated ( excluding Hwwaur after negotiations had proceeded 1 for sc long for the whole area. He finally j stated that his company mre not interested in a part of the area out were only interested in the whole and ho informed His Highness on behulf of the company that the offer which had been nade would have to be withdrawn in its entirety if the area was to be divided. v/ His Highness agreed that the offer for the whole area was not unfavourable and said that he was not trying to obtain more money. He did not propose divluing the area but irely excluded Hawar which he considered giving to the other company in order that all parties might be satis- ?i 2 ?Si aa $ 0: Tder to prevent complications and diifieulties in the future which ai./,ht arise owing to the proximity of Hawar to the Petroleum woncession Limited 1 * concession. He agreed that the Bahrain Petroleum Company had brougnt great benolita to -bhr^ia and that they had exceeded all their obligations, he pointed out that ikwmr was u very small island and very far away and its loss to the company would not cause them any material loss. He mentioned that Petroleum uonoessions plaited was a British company but if the Bahrain retroleusi company hud obtained the ^attar concession there would have been no difficulty about their having iinwar.

Davies said in his offer he had met every wish of His Highness. ills company would always respect their obligations.

If &amp; rival company was admitted his company would have to protect its interests. Mr. Davies pointed out that his company had sound economic reasons for running as much Arabian oil as possible, reasons which were s@T aside when the company framed the offer indicating what it was willing to pay and trie guarantees it was willing to give for the pri vilege of continuing to v*ork with the secure feeling of the past. His Highness said that he thought he ought to rive Samar to the other company and it was a long way from Bahrain. 7. Mr. Davies continued that it was met a ma tter of his' company’s offer was generous lor the sole purpose of obtaining the entire area and continuing the harmonious and undisturbed relations between the comDany and the Auler. Be asked what right had the other company to expect even a small part of His Highnesses territory after the 3uhrain Petroleum company b&amp;d done so much for Bahrain.

Further, my Company is prepared to undertake that the amount received by His Highness in respect of royalties shall not be less than Ig 8,50, COO per year for this same period, suoject to the same conditions as above. The remaining terms and provisions contained in my letter of December 28, 1938, remain as stated therein except for the last paragraph on page 2. That paragraph should now read as follows: 'In addition to the above obligations applying specifically to the Unallotted Area, my Company will also agree to increase its drilling obli ation under the/-- 2 - €h&gt; m the present Mining Lease. During the period of one year following the date the lease including the Unallotted Area is signed, my Company will maintain at lease 4 strings of tools in continuous operation within the area covered by the present Lease. M It has bean decided to drill a deeo test on the Dammam Structure in Arabia and it would be uneconomic and unnecessary to drill deep tests simultaneously on two structures as similar and as close together as these are. Decision as to a deep test at Bahrain will be made upon completion of the Dammam deep test. Yours faithfully, Sd/~ F. A. Davies. .Representative THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LTD. *****. I* # v^ 1S?

Belgraye, Adriser to the Bahrain Government, Manama, Bahrain. Dear Sir: Further in connection with ay Company*s written offer contained in the letter addressed to you dated December 28, 1938, will you kindly advise His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrain as follows: To indicate to His Highness that my Company is ready and anxious to do all within its power to guarantee that there shall be no decline in the prosperity of Bahrain, and with the hope that such action will speed up negotiations and bring them to a prompt conclusion giving my Company the Concession agreement it is asking for; I have today increased the minimum royalty provision under the heading '•Third Alternative 1 * in my former letter to Rs.12,50,000 per year for the first half of the 15 year period, under the same conditions as given in that letter. The other terms remain as set out in that letter. In response to the request made by Sheikh Mohammed, I am pleased to repeat the assurance which has already been given to His Highness. Will you be so kind as to assure His Highness that, as in the past, my Company will continue in the future to give all possible consideration to Bahrain and its welfare. My Company hopes that at no time during the period mentioned will it be necessary to out Bahrein*s production back to the055) number of tone represented by this minimum royalty figure. In order that there may be no misunderstanding between us, however, I wish to point out that the deoision as to the actual quantity of oil to be produced — whether it will be more than this figure and if so, how much more — must rest solely with the Company. In this connection the Company will of course have to talce into account such factors as market demand, available sources of supply, developments or events unforeseen now, and the like. It is because of the uncertainty of these factors that my Company has been willing to set such a high figure -- more than eight times the present minimum. This amount of income should ensure to His Highness that Bahrain's prosperity will continue even if it should prove necessary or advisable to produce at the minimum rate stipulated, I trust this letter will give His Highness the assurance he wishes and that we can have his deoision soon. Tours faithfully, Representative THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITEDii.o. 1978/9- Bahrain, January 4, 19B9 Dear Major holme a 9 This is to confirm my statement to you yesterday morning regarding your company^ offer for the addi tional area, 1 informed you that I ms instructed by His Highness to tell you that your offer ms very much lower than that of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and to enquire from you whether you wished to recon sider and increase the offer, 1 mentioned that the Bahrain Government regarded the minimum royalty as a matter of the greatest impor tance and I also said that the six years option period was considered extremely long, I told you ttet the Bahrain Government was considering the area as a whole, You explained that the six years period might be reduced. The mattor of imported oil from Saoudi - *rabia was mentioned and there was some conversation about territorial waters, I understood from you that you were of the opinion that your company would wish to withdraw from competi tion partly because the Bahrain Government might include the question of imported oil as a factor in its negotia tions with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. I informed you that I was not at liberty to dis close the particulars of the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s offer for the concession without further reference to his highness. Yours sincerely,COPY. CONFIDENTIAL. Dear ( With reference to your letter No. 1978/9-A3feO dated January 4th. 1939. 1. There seems to have been some misunderstanding regarding what we both desired to convey at our meeting on the 3 rd. January. 2 . I was under the impression that you told me in the early part of our talk that H.H. had, to all practical pur poses already decided to give the whole of the unallotted areas and waters to the Bahrain Petroleum Co., as a result of several meetings between you and the Ruler and a Bahrain Petroleum Go’s representative which culminated in a high offer with which in your opinion ray Company would not wish to compete. I gathered that this offer either consisted partly of, or included, a guaranteed minimum annual payment which was designed to reassure the Ruler that his revenues would not suffer as a result of the importation of oil free of tax from Arabia. 3. You stated later however that H.H. delegated you\ to inquire from me whether P.C.L. wished to reconsider and inorrase their offe . You gave the impression that the Ruler and yourself felt, if not assumed, in view of BAPCO’s attractive offer, that my Company would not be prepared to offer anything acceptable to H.H. I stated that this assumption should not be made. I have cabled my Company the position as herein stated, and asked for instructions, but so far I have not received a rep ly. I will communicate with you again after hearing from London, 4. I endeavoured to explain to you, that my Company would find it very difficult to amend their offer if they had to make provision in it for possible compensation for loss of revenue as a result of decreased production by BA.PCO and, in these exceptional, if not unique circumstances, it seemed reasonable and equitable that I should be informed of the minimi annual royalty which was to be guaranteed and particulars of BaPCO ' s offer bearing on this new factor in Concession negotia tions. I note that you will refer to H.H. for permission to disclose this information. 5. as regards your para (4) it was never my inten tion to convey that my Company would wish to withdraw. In this connection see ray para (4) above. 6 . It would seemthat the misunderstandings revealed could best be cleared up at another meeting in the near future and I trust the conclusions of your letter have not been oommu nicated so far to any other parties. Yours sincerely, (Signed) Frank Holmes. t ' — p. 298 1939 P) Da tied 5th. January 1939.u.s.s. Bahrein Unallotted Area. Please see the submission flagged on P.Z.203/39 and also the telegram at P.Z.204, which was authorised for issue hut was withdrawn on receipt of the later telegram from the Political Agent, Bahrein, of the 11th January. This telegram says that the Shaikh has now written and asked specifically for an assurance that H.M.G.’s goodwill will not he forfeited if he grants a concession.to the Bahrein Petroleum Company over the whole of the Unallotted Area. This fear has been inspired in his mind by the P.C.L. negotiator, Major Holmes, who appears to be behaving in a very unfortunate manner. Mr. Walton had previously been averse to doing more than remind the Shaikh of the sentence in our telegram of the 15th December, P.Z.8255, which said that H.M.Gr. did not wish to influence the Shaikh^ attitude in his negotiations with either companyjunless he definitely approached the Political authorities with1 * (tg) ^ 2 a request for something definite. As he has now done so, we must clearly try to allay his apprehensions and I would suggest that the simplest way will now be to combine both telegrams in one and to tell the Shaikh that, whatever conclusions he arrives at as a result of the negotiations, this will not affect the goodwill of H.M.G. I submit a draft accordingly. The Foreign Office have already concurred and I expect to receive the concurrence of the Petroleum Department and the Admiralty shortly.(6610) Wt.25956/236 10,000 9/38 A.&amp;E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 I f !

January, 1939. Dear Peel, With reference to your letter of the 11th January (P.Z.203/39) on the subject of the Bahrein Unallotted Area, I agree generally with the terms of your proposed telegram to Fowle. Mr. Fraser, the Deputy Chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and a Director of the Iraq Petroleum Company was here a day or two ago and I had a few words with him about Bahrein. I mentioned in confidence that Fowle was not happy about the way Holmes was handling the discussions Fraser T s reply was what I expected it would be that Holmes was the only man available who could carry out this job of work. The Company had done what they could by sending Skliros to Bahrein, but he could not stay for detailed discussions. Fraser evidently feels that Fowle has rather got up against Holmes and can see no good in him. Fraser then went on to say that R. T. Peel, Esq., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1. fetenr, | rFICE- 2 - W? r Petroleum Concessions Limited had not said their last word on Bahrein and he intimated that they were prohahly going to make a fight of it still. We may therefore find that the Company will he prepared to improve their terms and much as I dislike this method of an auction, I think it would he unfortunate in the circumstances if the Skeikh were to get the impression that we should not he pleased to see Petroleum Concessions Limited get what they are seeking. As long as Petroleum Concessions Limited are in earnest I feel we n2|*kt to do what we can to see that they get a fair show. I should therefore like to suggest a small addition to the draft telegram, viz. the insertion of the words 'at least' after the word 'appropriate' in line 6 from the bottom of page 1. If we do not do this there seems to he a danger that the Skeikh may assume that we are not really interested in the rest of the territory. The Standard of California are very active in this part of the world and I am to-day sending G-ihson a letter on Gwadur which seems to indicate that the Sultan of Muscat is not giving correct information to the Political Agent of his discussions with the Burmah Oil Company and Indian Oil Concessions Limited, and that he is actually using betterterms offered ty the former to push up the latter, while at the same time telling the Political Agent that the Burmah offer is not as good as that of Indian Oil Concessions.

Subsequently we received Bahrein express letter of 16 October ITo.D.

The other Departments concurred in this pnoposal^ j^We accordingly- explained to Lord Cadman the complete change in the Sheikh f s attitude since last May when he was prepared to make « a division substantially corresponding to the wishes of Lord Cadma^s Company, and that this was due to his fear that if/2 if another Company was admitted to Bahrein, the Bahrein Petroleum Com any would slow down production. 7e informed Lord Cadman that we felt that it would he necessary to decide the matter in accordance with the Sheikh 1 s wishes and /Sn that it would not he possible meruTy to bring pressure to hear on him.

We made it clear however that if negotiations are resumed the Bahrein Petroleum Company roust also be allowed to resume them, and that they must not be unduly protracted as- H.M.G. themselves would be averse to any considerable postponement of a decision. I take this opportunity of enclosing copies/3 copies of the letters which were sent to the other Departments on 5 November after receipt of Bahrein express letter of 16 October. A copy of your express letter of 3 November has also been sent to the other Departments.

Lord Cadrnan has 'been informed of the change v/hich has taken place in the Sheikh’s attitude since May in case his Company might v;iah to make any representations to the Secretary of State before a final decision is arrived at. Lord Cadman has asked: that his company should he allowed to send a representative to Bahrein to approach the Sheikh with a view to negotiations. H.M.G. have no objection and we have informed Lord Cadman that his representative may approach the Sheikh. ITame of representative who may be expected to arrive in Bahrein shortly, will be telegraphed as soon as company informs us. Lord Cadman has been informed of the improbability of the Sheikh changing his mind and fully understands that we are not prepared to put any pressure on H.H. and also that we would be averse to any considerable postponement of a decision so that if ne otiations take place they must not be unduly protracted. He also understand that if Sheikh resumes negotiations with P.C.L., Bahrein P-troleum Company must also be allowed to resume them. Political/v 2 Political Agent should observe a neutral attitude. If Sheikh asks for advice, vhen approached by P.C.L's representative, Political Agent should say that E.I.l.G. do not wish to influence his attitude, but that since P.C.L* have asked for an opportunity of restating their case before a final decision is taken, we would not think it unreasonable if H.H. gave their representative a hearing while giving a similar opportunity to the Bahrein Petroleum Company, and that meanwhile we have informed P.C.L. that their representative may approach H.H.25th April : Sad Llax: 9 th Mav: 7th l.'av: 22nd May: 23th ^av: SasLJuna; 3rd June: 8 th June: Lord Cadman was told that the Sheikh had probably already decided to divide the area, so that there was no need for F.ajor Holmes. Lord C. hoped that H.M.G. would see their way to influencing the Sheikh to accept P.C.L.'s proposals for a division. Sir T. Fowle telegraphed that he understood unofficially that the Sheikh intended a division largely coinciding with P.C.L .*3 wishes. In reply to an enquiry from Lord G. he was informed of the above. The Sheikh wrote to the Political Agent making this proposal. Mr. Thornberg intimated that if P.C.L. were admitted, the B.P.G. might concentrate on their ilawsr concession to the detriment of Bahrein production. Political Agent telegraphed that Sheikh wished to negotiate with B.P.C. for the whole area, minus Hawar. Secretary of State telegraphed that Sheikh should be advised to put his original proposals to both Companies in order to elicit their views and offers in writing. Lord C. informed that B.P.C. had strongly objected to division of the area, and were prepared to make a large offer for the whole of it. Letter from the Sheikh to both Companies ££th.

The Sheikh sent no letters to the Companies pending consideration by H.M.G. This took place during the summer, with the ass i stance of Mr. Belgrave, who was on leave, and it was decided to advise the Sheikh to postpone a decision sine die . Meanwhile the Sheikh went to India. Conversation with Mr. Lewisohn, who was warned that the Company must not be under any misapprehension that the Sheikh had decided to divide the area in the manner desired by P.C.L.; the question of the unallotted area was under discussion between the Sheikh and II.M.G., pending the results of which there was no question of negotiations being reopened. Express letter (received 26th October) from the Political Agent that the Sheikh rejected the proposal to postpone a decision and that he wished to give the whole area to B.P.C. (except, possibly, Hawar; but he no longer wished to offer Hawar to P.C.L.).

Dear Gibson, In reply to Peel’s letter to Jones, NO.PZ7288/38 of the 5th November, I write to say that we should have no objection to your listening to any representations which Lord Cadman may wish to make, before coming to a decision as regards the disposal of the Bahrein unallotted area. Unless, however, in the course of his talks with the India Office he is able to throw a new light on 1 the situation, we feel that the balance of advantage would lie in letting the Bahrein Petroleum Company have the whole of the area, less possibly the Hawar Islands. This ii rum i i j conclusion is-based mainly on the fact that from the Admiralty point of view the predominant consideration is that the oil should be available and of the right quality. */hile the oil won at Bahrein possesses certain defects, it could at a pinch be used by H.M. Ships if other supplies failed, and in the light of the activity shown up to the present by the American Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited, it seems to us probable that the former would be more vigorous in developing the unallotted area than the latter. We should accordingly have no objection to the Sheik of Bahrein being allowed at once to follow what appears to be his present inclination, namely, to give a concession for the whole of the unallotted area, minus the Hawar Islands, to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. We should, however, very much like to make the grant dependent upon the Company subscribing to a preemption clause and J*! 5 * Gibson, Esq., INDIA OFFICE, S.W.l. CL.CU and -fcke satisfactory refinery agreement for the whole area formed by the new and the existing concessions. It would also be desirable to reserve the right of Petroleum Concessions Limited to erect a refinery at Bahrein. We recognise that if the unallotted area is thus given to the American Company there may be unfortunate reactions on those of the Trucial Sheiks who have not yet come to terms with the Petroleum Concessions Limited, but for the reasons indicated above we consider it more important to reach an early settlement at Bahrein where oil is known to exist, rather than at Ras-al-Khaimah and Abu Dhabi^where there may be no oil.

I am writing to let you know that we see no objection to the proposal that this development should be explained in the first place confidentially to Petroleum Concessions Limited in order to give the Company, if they so desire, an opportunity of making representations. As to the basis to be aimed at for the sub-division of the Unallotted Area, I am inclined to agree with the views expressed in the second page of your letter. But as you suggest, these questions can be further considered after we know the reactions of Petroleum Concessions Limited to the news that further postponement is. ui\likely to be secured. RECD.

Reference Political Agent Bahrain’s Express Letter No.D.T. 86 , dated the 16th October 1938, with enclosure. 2. The Political Agent Bahrain’s letter would seem to reinforce the arguments for the opinion I gave in paragraph 6 of my Express Letter No.g/337, dated the 19th June 1938* His Majesty’s Government’s proposal that the Shaikh should postpone his decision sine die is obviously most unacceptable to him, and if this suggestion is turned into a decision he will certainly feel that his interests and those of his State have been sacrificed, which opinion will, I think, be shared by all hie subjects. In this connection His Highness’s arguments in paragraph 3 of his Memorandum beginning H The revenue from Oil is of vital importance to Bahrain” are of much weight. Further / {Signature) REfSfl. POL.

( Uesignatvm)4 ./ Further the knowledge that His Majesty’s Government had prevented the Bahrain State from increasing its income considerably would naturally have a deplorable effect not only locally but in the neighbouring Arab countries, where it would of course become public property and the subject of much adverse comment* 3* Similarly I do not imagine that the Bahrain Petroleum Company would accept, with any equanimity, a sine die decision owing to the uncertainty in which they would be placed. In this connection please see enclosure to India Office letter Ho. P*Z« 3234 / 38 , dated the 14th May 1938, to me, recording a conversation which Ballantyne had with Gibson. In this record the following sentence occurs j 'Whether the area should be given wholly to one Company or the other or divided between them was a matter for the shaikh to decide and His Majesty’s Government’s attitude thereto was neutral and unbiassed.” It seems t o me quite probable that if His Majesty’s Government block the Bahrain Petroleum Company at Bahrain the Company may consider their agreement with His Majesty’s Government not to enter the Trucial Coast (vide Mr.Ballantyne’s letter dated the 19th March 1937 - India Office Ho.P.Z.1871/37) at an end, and may enter that area. This of course would be most undesirable. Against this particular argument is the fact that once Petroleum Concessions Limited have obtained the remaining concessions on the Trucial Coast they will not be able to operate there. The fact remains however that at present Petroleum Concessions Limited have obtained only two out of a possible seven.&lt;5- 4 0 it will be seen that the Shaikh now does not even wish to give Hawar to Petroleum Concessions Limited. I am not of opinion that we should accept this. In this connection see paragraph 3 of my Express Letter quoted above. Hawar geo graphically is outside the Bahrain area and adjoining ^atar, where Petroleum Concessions Limited already have a concession and in fairness therefore it should go to them. In connection with the ownership of Hawar please see correspondence ending with your Express Letter Ho*P.Z.4962/38, dated the 21st July 1938. I am enquiring from the Political Agent Bahrain whether ary reply has been received from the Shaikh of Qatar. 5. Should His Majesty^s Government accept the recommenda tion made in my immediately succeeding paragraph, I think that opportunity might be taken of insisting on the insertion in the concession for the Unallotted Area a pre-emption clause in favour of His Majesty’s Government to cover not only the product from the Unallotted Area but also from the present concessional area. 6 . In conclusion personally I am definitely of opinion that His Majesty’s Government should inform the Shaikh that with reference to the final paragraph of his Memorandum they agree to his proposal provided Hawar is allotted to Petroleum Concessions Limited but not otherwise.

Ay ©aha was rather impressed by his arguments and went to Shaikh Hamad to repeat them all.

P. C. on 7th November 1938. Mr. Thornburg came to see me, with a letter of introduction from Mr. Belgrave^ to talk about the Bahrein Unallotted Area. He explained that he was in this country for a few days before going on to America and was anxious that the viev/s of his Company on this question should be presented to the India Office by someone with first-hand knowledge of conditions on the spot. I gathered that Mr. Thornburg will not be returning to Bahrein, He was aware that there had been an idea of a further suspension of negotiations, but the Sheikh had told him that he had now made up his own mind in favour of B.P.C. for the whole area and that his views had been passed on to the India Office. I, of course, made no comment on this beyond saying that it was the case that the matter was now under discussion between the Sheikh and H.M.G., but Mr. Thornburg’s exact knowledge of the course of events shows how impossible it is to keep things secret in these oil negotiations. The Sheikh having come to this conclusion, Mr. Thornburg found it difficult to see what possible reason there could be of a political nature to induce H.M.G. to override him. He was aware that there was criticism in some quarters of the fact that his Company was an American one, but if it came to that his rivals, though nominally British, were in fact composed of a number of foreign elements; and in any case his Company had shown in Bahrein that they were always anxious to co-operate to the fullest extent with the British authorities, and if it came to a crisis the British Government must know perfectly well that the Company would be prepared to give them anything they asked for. He said that his Company were well able to meet their rivals in/in the field of commercial competition, but they were apprehensive of the political influence which they knew Lord Cadman was able to exercise in this country. His Company felt very strongly that the introduction of a second oil company into Bahrein would be attended with the most unfortunate consequences. Bahrein is a small place and there is no room in it for two competing interests. His Company were now well established there with a self- contained colony of their own, and their relations both with the Political Authorities and with the Sheikh and his family and Mr. Belgrave were excellent. Bahrein is at present the one loyal Sheikhdom in the Gulf, and, with the guidance of its Adviser, has benefited to the full from its oil revenues. But the Sheikh is a sick man and might die at any moment, and when that happens there are likely to be difficulties; especially as even in Bahrein there have recently been signs of the emergence of ideas on the lines of the ,, popular ,, movement which has come to the fore in Koweit and Debai. It is, therefore, of the greatest importance, both to the Company and to H.M.G., that nothing should be done to disturb the present harmonious working of the State, and he feared that the only result of introducing P.C.L. into what B.P.C. naturally felt was their own ground would be serious friction. His Company would not want friction but they suspect their rivals of wishing to oust them from their position, and, knov/ing Major Holmes and Mr. Skliros as he did, he was afraid that they would not be scrupulous in their methods. Nor would the friction be confined to the personnel of the two Companies only; what would happen would be that P.C.L. would get at one of the members of the Sheikhly family, probably by means of bribes, and/3. g . i'- and would foment a party hostile to B.P.C. The influence of this v/ould spread from the Sheikhly family downwards. It is because of their fear of friction of this kind that B.P.C., who do not attach much importance to the oil prospects in the Unallotted Area, are so anxious to keep out another Company from this field. They had no complaint against being excluded altogether from an area, as for instance the Trucial Coast, but what they did object to was having another Company thrust upon them in an area in which they already had a concession. They feel that if they have benefited from their concession so has Bahrein, and they have been there long enough to feel more than a purely commercial interest in the future of the State. Mr. Thornburg hoped that at any rate t here would not be much further delay over the settlement of this question since it made it very difficult for his Company to work out their future programme, both for Bahrein and for Hasa, until they knew what the position was going to be in the Unallotted Area. On the v/hole I was favourably impressed by Mr, Thornburg, who we had been rather inclined to regard as the villain of the piece, and I think that there is considerable force in v/hat he says as to the small size of Bahrein and the impossibility of two Cornpanies working in that area at the same time. I promised to pass on what he had told me and to let him know if he could do any good by an interview with anyone else in this Office. I do not think it is necessary to trouble anyone else to see him but he will be here until Friday if he is wanted.d 3 &amp; FILE COPY 2 NOV ft fX3 GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. . C 0, XM j R A .JJ Department.

Please see ry note of 23rd July at fla^ A, the letter sent to the Political Resident, at flag B, the Bahrein express letter now received, and Mr. Peel’s attached note. Before coming- t~ a final decision we now have to break the news of the Sheikh’s attitude to P.C.L. and give them an opportunity of making, any representations. The object of the draft letter to the other Depts., which is submitted / is to obtain their concurrence in this step. r 'he complete change in the Sheikh^ attitude, which occurred suddenly at the end of May, puts us in a rather v\ difficult position with P.C.L. On 7th Fay, 1938, the Sheikh wrote to the Political Agent proposing a division of the area in a sense which largely coincided with ., the main islands to the Americans and the outlying reefs and the mtVJdrv group to P.C.L.). On 25th April Sir T. Fowle had informed Lord Cadman that this was likely to be the Sheikh’s decision. At the end of Fay, however, as the result of an informal approach by the Americans, the Sheikh wished to give the reefs as well as the main islands to them. Be now adheres to thi s/w HA **/^ this (and also wishes to give them the Q&amp;rnnro group). We can consider the best manner of informing P.C.L. of the developments. As it is a long story, the best course might perhaps be to write in the first instance privately to Lord Cadman and leave it to him, if he wishes, to ask for an interview. 3, fr- A u A a ft c 2fZ 7 m Draft Paper.

Will you please refer to the express letter dated l6th October from the Political Agent, Bahrein, on the subject of the Bahrein Unallotted Area. A copy of the letter was sent to the Admiralty Foreign Office, under cover of Petroleum Dept. India Office letter of the 29th October, No.P.Z.7288/38. 2. Our suggestion for a postponement of the negotiations was based to some extent on Belgrave’s opinion that it would be welcome to the Sheikh and that His Highness and his family were satisfied with their present income from the oil royalties. It is clear now either that Belgrave was misinformed or, perhaps more probably, that the views of the Sheikh and his brother have changed since Belgrave went on leave. The Sheikh has indeed come down on the side of the Bahrein Petroleum Company more heavily even than we had any reason to expect and does not now wish to give any part of the area to Petroleum Concessions Limited. 3* Our provisional view in the light of Weightrna^s report is that the suggestion for a postponement of the negotiations must now be abandoned v|/ and /2 and that in all the circumstances it would be difficult to advise the Sheikh in a sense contrary to his desire to give the area,or the bulk of it, to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. We are inclined to think, however, though these are questions which can be considered later, that the Sheikh should be advised not to give any working rights to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in the Hawar Islands in view of their contiguity to Qatar in which Petroleum Concessions Limited hold the concession, and further that he should be persuaded, if possible, to give Petroleum Concessions Limited for that reason an opportunity to obtain a concession over these Islands (assuming, of course, that Bahrein sovereignty over them is recognised by H.M.G.) and possibly also over the northern reef of Pasht Dibal. 4* Before however any orders are sent to the Gulf we would propose, in viev; of our past contacts with Petroleum Concessions Limited in this matter, to inform that Company in confidence of the Sheikh’s attitude, which has changed so materially since May (when he contemplated a division of the area more or less in accordance with their wishes) and to give them an opportunity of making any representations to the Secretary of State. You will recollect (para.2 of our express letter to Bushire, P.Z. 5882/38, dated 1st September) that we proposed to follow this/Draft Paper. 7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38 3. Department. this course in the event of the Sheikh agreeing to a postponement, and it seems even more desirable in view of the attitude which the Sheikh has actually adopted, to give Lord Cadman an opportunity to put forward any representations which he may have to offer on the matter. This is the immediate point on which I would wish to consult you. Will you kindly let me know as soon as you can whether you concur in the proposal that the situation should he explained to Lord Cadman in the first place. I am writing similarly to Eyres and Starling^ Jones and Starling. Jones and Eyres. 5* We propose to write to you later in regard to the question of the agreements with H.M.G. which we ought to obtain from the Bahrein Petroleum Company as a condition of sanctioning the additional concession (assuming that this Company is to get the bulk of the Unallotted Area). In this connection the question will arise whether we could not reasonably require the Bahrein Petroleum Company to enter into a pre-emption agreement with ns covering the whole area of their concessions in Bahrein (both the existing one and any/h any additional one) as a condition of H.M.G.’s approval of any new concession which they may now obtain from the Sheikh. There is also the question whether we might seek an agreement that the hulk of the oil from the whole area should he refined in Bahrein. Yours sincerely, (3*cQ R.

On the 12th October I communicated to His Highness the aikh of Bahrain the preliminary views of His Majesty's Govern ment, as set out in paragraph 3 of the ixprees letter under refe rence. His Highness requested an interval of two or three days in which to consider his reply, hut it was evident that he was not favourably impressed. He interpolated a vehement negative at the reference to hie presumable satisfaction with his present royalties and the comparative unimportance of a further concession from the pecuniary point of view; the mention of the possible dis appointment of Petroleum Concessions Limited was greeted with some impatience; and the suggestion that it might be of advantage to himself as well as to His Majesty's Government to wait and observe developments in Hasa clearly failed to Impress him. I was left with no doubt that His Highness personally was strongly opposed to a postponement • 3 — 3 /- REGn. PQ*-- 26 OCT1938 LPT. S/44.

I undertook to forward this memorandum and repeated that there must be no communication to either Company until the final advice of His kajesty 1 s Government is conveyed to the Shaikh* His Highness assured me that he had no intention of holding any communication with the Companies meanwhile* 5* I think I should attempt some explanation of the new attitude adopted by His Highness and his brothers* At first sight/-3- sight one would assume that they had been subjected to pressure by the American Company, but on reviewing the past few months I do not believe this to be the true explanation. The 'active agentfl rt on behalf of the Bahrain Petroleum Company have throughout been Mr. Thornburg and Hussain Yatim - the latter behind Ute scenes. The former only returned to Bahrain a few days ago and, apart from a formal call, has not yet seen His Highness and his brothers. Hussain Yatim has been in Europe and he also has only just returned. I need not unduly lengthen this letter by giving my further reasons for the belief, which is shared by Mr. Belgrave, that American influence is not the cause. 6. On the other hand I have for some time doubted if the belief in His Highness’ entire contentment with his (and the State’s) present income was altogether warranted. It would be unjust to speak of avarice or greed in connection with Shaikh Hamad, but he spends his money freely - and enjoys it. It may be illustrative to note that his sole comment on the last royalty cheque for over 18 lakhs of rupees was that he trusted the next one would be better. Finally, the Administration is faced by the dual necessity for creating a large Reserve ^und and financing simultaneously various major schemes as soon as they possibly can. Both these are admirable objectives, but they serve to sharpen both the desire for increased revenues and the fear of retarded development of the American Company’s existing Concession. 7. ihere is another point of much importance to which attention should be drawn. The pearl industry is moribund, and, so far as I can judge, the Gulf Arabs have now come to the/-the dismal conclusion that it is unlikely ever to recover. It is to this that I ascribe much of the unrest which has manifested itself lately, and the leaders of the A1 Khali- fah family have, I believe, come to much the same conclu sion. This renders it all the more important to them to consider how best they can increase their revenue from oil, or at the very least how to ensure most effectively that that revenue cannot fall below a certain figure. They believe, not without reason, that the latter object certainly, and probably the former, can be secured by settling with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. There have already been suggestions 0 f a minimum royalty of Hs. 5 lakhs and of a fixed ratio between Bahrain and Kasa oil passing through the Refinery* while as for the possible development of the TTnallotted Area they have only to ask themselves which Company is In the better position to set about the task the more rapidly. 8. Thus the whole basis of the belief that His Highness would welcome postponement has disintegrated. And while he would undoubtedly seek to avoid causing offence to His Majesty’s Government, he is confident they will see the matter as he does - as a matter mainly affecting the pros perity and contentment of Bahrain - and will not advise him against his own interests. As for his attitude towards the Companies, the memoranda now forwarded nuts his feel ings bluntly, and I suspect that he and his brothers no longer suffer from the delusion that Petroleum Concessions Limited is a purely British Company. 9. I mi^ht perhaps add the following information. The London and New York offices of the American Company have apparently had wind of the postponement proposal and viewV. A m&gt; 3 al * it with considerable disfavour. A postponement sine die necessarily leaves them in a state of suspense) and) since it is inevitable that some member of the A1 Khalifah will sooner or later disclose to them the gist of che present memorandum, it may be expected that they will use every endeavour to ^aid' its acceptance by His Kajesty*s Govern ment. 10. I am submitting other comments to the Political Resident. Sd/- H. ?eightman. Political Agent, Bahrain. Attested Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain,Meaorandusi of His Highness's views regarding negotiations for an oils concession over the Hahr&amp;in un-allp area / ^ Ob &gt;tted » I His Highness is grateful to the British Government for assisting him with advice regarding the additional area* He is confident that the British ^overzuaent would not wish him to do anything which might be detri mental to the future interest of Bahrain and especially to the revenue of the State. His Highness considers that the Bahrain Petroleum Company have reasonable cause to fear interference if t another oil company were granted a concession in Bahrain territory. His Highness believes that such interference might have the effect of reducing development by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. His Highness's territory is small. The existing oil concession includes most of the country and His Highness is doubtful whether there is room in Bahrain for two large rival oil companies to work without friction. The revenue from oil is of vital importance to Bahrain. The pearl industry 9 previously the source of Bahrain's prosperity, is suffering from acute depression from which it is unlikely to recover. The present revenuerevenue is perhaps sufficient for the present admi nistration of the country but it is not sufficient for important developments which. His Highness eon- templates* Oil is not a lasting product* There is no guarantee that the supply will last more than 15 or £0 years* In this tine it is of the utmost | importance to build up a Reserve i?und which will provide an assured income for the country when oil begins to diminish* His Highness cannot agree that he is satisfied with the present income from Royalties nor does he think it enough for the above reasons* His Highness has no wish to cause disappointment to either of the oil companies but he regards them both as commercial concerns who are competing for the same object and he thinks it is inevitable that one of them will be disappointed* His Highness does not . feel that he should sacrifice anything which is to the interest of his country in order to prevent a com mercial firm from suffering disappointment at not obtaining something which it never owned* His Highness does not see any mwadvantage to be gained for Bahrain by the further postponement ofof negotiations* Be would like to settle the Batter finally as soon as possible* A thing which has affected his opinion in this natter is the urgent need which has lately become apparent, of revising certain clauses and making certain alterations in the exist ing agreement with the Bahrain Petroleum Company, to safeguard the interests of Bahrain in the future, including increasing the minimum royalty which is now It lakhs* Bis Highness wishes to raise this amount* govern the proportion of imported oil and Bahrain oil which is refined in Bahrain and various other matters, the details of which have not been fully discussed* Mis Highness thinks that it would be possible now to improve various conditions in the agreement which could not be altered afterwards* His Highness considers that the remaining area might be discussed as a whole and not divided into two portions as was previously suggested*Minute Paper.

T sew Fr. Lewisohn this evening and discussed with him the terms of the reply to be sent to Mr. Skliros (see Mr. Gibson’s note below ; . We agreed that the reply should be on the following lines, namely, that the matter was under consideration and that there was no question of reopening negotiations at the present time, nor was it possible to indicate any date for resumption. The India Office would see no objection to Major Holmes going to Bahrein J£* the Company-jHad think it desirable to have him there in orde^ to watch tho »1 jotmontj ii . but in view of Mr. Thornberg’s departure they saw no immediate urgency. T then drew attention to the present position of the negotiations and told Mr. Lewisohn that we felt a little doubt as to whether the Company might not be under some misapprehension as to the position. I recalled a conversation which we had had with Mr.Longrigg in June of this year and the subsequent talk on the when telephone with Lord Cadman/we had explained that B.P.C. had made representations recently against the division of the area and had shown themselves much more anxious than they v/ere last yea^ to obtain the whole of the unallotted area and were consequently prepared to make a much larger offer for it. We had felt that it was only fair to P.C.L. to acquaint them at once v/ith this new development in accordance with our undertaking to Lord Cadman. The next development was the letter sent by the Sheikh to the two Companies on the 8th June in which he had invited their viev/s on a possible geographical division of the area. These viev/s together with the 7173 Wt 8900/111 10,000 4.38 views/jmmmm views of the Sheikh had been forwarded hy the authorities to this country for the consideration of H-. M. G. The Companies f representatives and Mr. Selgrave had then all left Bahrein on leave and subsequently the Sheikh himself owing to ill-health had also had to leave Bahrein for the time being. He had now however returned and the present position was that certain matters in connection with the unallotted area were now under discussion between the Sheikh and Government and pending the results of that discussion there was no question for the moment of negotiations being reopened. What we v/anted to be sure about was that the Company had not read more into the Sheikh’s letter than it said and were not under the impression that he had made in his letter a definite offe to divide up the area in the manner suggested. We had explained the position to Mr. Longrigg at the end of June, but we v/ished to make quite su^e that it was understood by the Company. Mr. Lewisohn said that he quite understood the position and that though Mr. Skliros may have wished to think that the letter did suggest a definite intention to divide the area in the manner suggested, he was quite clear that he did in fact realise that there was no definite commitment., cO FILE CCR£ to P olitical Be'partr gnt j S 3S Copies Circulated. 7097 1 3990.

J p OiBSON K. L. Baggallay, Esq. , Foreign Office, S.W. 1 .■'IP. Z.6994/1938. (E 5262/201/34) Dear Gibson, I FOREIGN OFFICE, 11th Octobe S.VM. r, 1938. I enclose herein a record of a discussion which I had last month with Mylles, Lees and Browne, of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, arising from their wish to have some advice about the best way of defining the Company’s concession area in fersia, wnich, as you l:now, has to be done before the 31st December, 1938. You will see that we were concerned with three points, namely : (1) Whether His Majesty’s Government would raise any objection to the maritime boundary of the concession area being drawn, in places, outside the three mile territorial limit, (2) Hoy/ to dray/ the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt-el-^rab, and 2 . tha 11 (3) What is the position as regards the High Seas. Since the meeting I have been able to confirm t what I said about the High Seas, as recorded in paragraph oi the enclosure, v/as correct, and that the generally recognised viev/ of international lav/ with regard to the bed 01 the Open sea and the subsoil beneath it is that the sea bed and the subsoil is res nullius , but that it is capable of acquisition by effective occupation in the same manner as any unoccupied territory above the level of the sea. 3* During the meeting, however, it escaped my mind that questions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) above were dealt with in recent correspondence between the India Office and ourselves about the concession to be granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited in the ’’Bahrein Unallotted Area”. In that case, too, the question arose how to define the maritime boundary of the concession,/ Gibson Esq.5./ 2. concession, and our point of view was explained in a minute by Beckett enclosed in Brenan's letter to you Bo. E 2288/413/91 of the 25th April, 1938. In this minute Beckett pointed out that as far as the maritime regions of the concession were concerned, the obvious intention was that the Company should have the right to extract oil from the l and under t he se a, and that although the Sheikh of Bahrein had at present no right to land under the sea outside the three mile limit, it is recognised that the bed of the sea and the land under it is capable of acquisition beyond that limit. For this reason Beckett recommended that it v/ould be better to substitute for one word ^waters’* in the craft concession the words ,f submerged land', the efiect of which would be to give the Company the right to the land below the sea immediately within the three mile limit and also outside the three mile limit as soon as t hey had appropriated it . hOv. r I tin me this suggestion of Beckett points to tne means we are looking for of evading the difficulty about territorial waters which presents itself, or seemed to do so, in the case of the Anglo—Iranian Oil Company's concession in Persia. Since ny discussions with the Company's representatives I have looked up the Bersian law about territorial waters. Copies of this law were sent to you under cover of Foreign 01xice letter No. T 8364/41 48/380 of the 3rd Auguso 1934 and u x '~ Lr *tuer copy is enclosed herein for convenience of reference. You vvill see from Article I that although the Persians claim the right of control to a distance of twelve miles from the eoaso, they lay specific claim to the bed of the sea only as far as six miles Possibly, however, they 'would maintain that 'national interests' entitle them to control of mineral deposits up to the full twelve mile limit.3. 5 . Ve would suggest, therefore, that the Company should place the limits of their concession, wherever they wish to do so, up to a distance of twelve miles from the Persian coast, making it clear that the areas included beyond the coast are areas of sea bed . This would prevent the possibility of the Persian Government, at some future date, claiming the right - which, awing to the diversity of views about territorial waters, it would be difficult to dispute - to grant to another concern portions of the sea bed inside the twelve mile limit in which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company might be interested. Prom the Persian point of view the entire area within the limits drawn by the Company would then be Persian territory. Prom the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, however, the area as delimited would consist of Persian territory only up to the three mile limit, and as regards the parts of the sea bed outside that limit which the Company 'would have included in their concession area, the Company would not really have a right to them - as being under the High Seas - until they had taken steps to appropriate them. As we are presumably not in the least anxious that these areas should be appropriated by anybody else, both the Persians and ourselves would be perfectly happy. 6 . You will also be aware that in July 1936 our Legation at Caracas were instructed to initiate discussions with the Venezuelan Government with a view to the Governments of Trinidad and Venezuela taking simultaneous and parallel action to divide up as national territory between them the sea bed of the Gulf of Paria or such parts of it as might be of use for oil boring. 7* As regards question (2) namely the best way of drawing the boundary of the Company’s area at the mouth of the Bhatt-el-Ax^ab (referred to in paragraph 9 of the enclosed record), it has since occurred to me that the Company should4. draw their boundary here in such a way as to keep clear of the line dividing Persian from Iraqi territorial waters, as His Majesty*s Government conceive the line should most fairly be drawn (i«e. the principle that a ship is always in the waters of the country to whose coast it is closest). The difficulty about the Company doing this would, I think, be that they could not give any satisfactory explanation to the Persian Government if the latter were inquisitive about their reason for drawing the line in such a peculiar way, since it would have no geological justification. So far as geology is concerned, the Company*s desire is to get as much of the sea bed as they can in that part of the world. 8 * I should be grateful if you would let me know as soon as you can if you agree with the foregoing views, or if you have any comments to make. I cun. sending a similar letter to Jones (Admiralty) and Starling (Petroleum Department) and am sending a copy to the Board of Trade. Yours ever, (Sd.) Lacy Baggallay.P. 2 . 6994 / 1938 . COPY. (3 5262/201/34) Anglo-Iranian Oil Company T s C one e s sion Are a. Mr. ilylles, of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Gompany, called on Mr. Bagg^llay this afternoon, accompanied by Dr. Lees, the Company’s Chief Geologist and fir. W. E. Brovme, the Company’s Surveyor, in order to ash advice about the best may of defining the limits of the area or areas totalling - 100,000 square miles of Persian territory which the Company were now obliged, before the D'lst December 1933 and under the terms of the 1933 Concession Agreement, to choose as those in which they wished to operate their concession for the future. 2 . Mr. Mylies and his colleagues explained that up to certain depths of water modern boring machinery made it possible to tap oil fields lying under the sea and that there were parts ol the sea in the x-ersian Gulf which the Company wished to include in uhe area of their potential operations. They understood that His Majesty’s Government held that three miles was the limit of territorial waters, whereas the Persian Government claimed a belt of twleve miles. Along most of the Persian coast the width of sea which the Company wished to include in their concession was within the three mile limit. ±i.t the northern end of the Gulf, however, there were parts of the sea in the twelve mile belt which they wished to include. 3* £urthermore the chosen areas had to be precisely demarcated in order that the Persian Government might be able to Chech the measurements for themselves and mame sure that the^ did not exceed 100,000 square miles in all. This applied to the demarcation of such sections of the boundaries as followed/¥ 2. followed the coast as well sis to inland sections. As the existing naps of Southern Persia were inaccurate it was proposed to show these boundaries by fixing certain coordinates (whether on land or sea) and joining then together. ^ALong most of the coast they v/ould fix a number of straight lines just skirting the coast-line on the seaward side, with the object of allowing for uncertainties or future changes in that line and also of rendering mensuration easier. At Jask they would carry the boundary out for about three miles. It was only at the northern end, as had been said, that they wished to carry it out for as far as twelve miles. 4* The Company wished to know -whether the submission by them to the Persian Government of plans showing that they had chosen for their concession areas extending beyond the three mile limit, approved as they would necessarily have been by the Board of Directors, of whom two we re representatives of His Majesty’s Government, would commit His Majesty’s Government to a recognition of the Persian claim to a territorial limit of twelve miles. In other words, would His Majesty's Government object to the inclusion in the concession areas of waters outside the three mile limit ? 5* Mr. Baggallay explained shortly the position as regards territorial waters. It was true that His Majesty's Government, largely, he thought, for reasons connected with fisheries, held to the three mile limit. Most other countries accepted this view. Persia, however, claimed twelve miles, though he thought that she regarded this belt as divided into two fringes of six miles each and claimed rights falling short of full sovereignty in the outer fringe. He would look up the Persian law on the subject and let the Company know exactly what it laid down. Other countries besides Persia, for instance/instance Norway, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and he believed fortupal, also claimed more than three miles. 6 . The position in international lav was uncertain. Efforts to reach international agreement on the subject had so far cone to nothing, and although other countries could not say that His Majesty’s Government were wrong in maintaining that the proper limit was three miles, His Majesty's Government could not say that those countries were wrong in saying that the limit could and should be increased. Thus, if the matter were referred to arbitration the case would probably go in favour of whoever happened to be the defendant. If, for instance, His Majesty’s Government took the Persian Government to court because they objected to some act of sovereignty done by the Persian Government or their agents in waters lying between three and twelve miles from the Persian coast, they would probably be told that they had failed to prove that the Persian Government had no right to do what they had done in those waters. If on the other hand the Persian Government took His Majesty’s Government to court because of something done by, say, one of His Majesty’s Ships in such waters, they would probably be the ones to be told that they had failed to show that the warship had no right to do what it had done. 7* It was conceivable that, as time went on, the mineral potentialities of the bed of the sea, as brought to light by the problem facing the present meeting, would prove to be more important than questions of fishing rights and make it desirable for His Majesty’s Government themselves to claim more extensive territorial limits. (Dr. Lees quoted a case in point from the seas adjoining Trinidad). This, however, was mere speculation and for the moment His Majesty's Government were concerned to maintain as best they could, not withs tanding/4. notwithstanding the uncertain legal position he had described, the principle of the three mile limit. Nevertheless he thought that His majesty's Government v/ould not wish, if they could possibly avoid it, to press the Company to forego the possibility of boring outside the three mile limit in conditions giving them a reasonable assurance of exclusive possession. He wondered whether, in order to make it as easy as possible for His Majesty’s Government to do so, it would not be possible to find some formula whereby the area delimited by the Company could be referred to in such terms as would not identify it too closely with either the three mile or the twelve mile limit. He also enquired whether it would not be possible to say simply that in certain places the boundaries of the concession area or areas were 'the limits of Persian territorial waters'. It was, after all, possible that before the Company's concession expired in 1993 an international conference might fix territorial waters at six or ten or even twenty miles. Such a formula would guard the Company against all eventualities. In any case he would like to give the matter further consideration. 8 . Mr. Mylies and his colleagues thought a suitable formula could be found and said that they also would give it their thought. They did net, however, think that a mere mention of the 'limits of territorial waters' would be sufficient, since the Persian Government would either regard it as too vague, or else claim that it meant that the whole of the twelve mile (or at least six mile) limit was included in the concession areas - which night swallow up a lot of the 100,000 square miles. 9. They next asked how the Company should draw the boundary of their area at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, seeing that the frontier was delimited only as far as a point just below/5 below Pao on the left bank of the river. After Mr. Baggallay had given a short explanation of the position, as His Majesty’s G-overnnent saw it, under the 1913 Protocol and the 1p14 Proces Verbaux and of the various nethods which had been advanced for defining international frontiers where they passed through territorial waters (none of which had, however, universal international sanction), he said that so long as the Company choose a boundary which left the whole Pooka Channel outside their area he did not think (subject to the question of territorial 'waters already discussed) that His Majesty’s Government would wish to raise any objection to their fixing one of their coordinates at the tip of Marakat Abadan and from there carrying their line out to sea more or less as a prolongation of the final section of the left bank of the river. The Company’s representatives agreed to avoid the Pooka Channel completely. 10. Dr. Lees then asked what was the position as regards the High Seas. Would it be possible for the Company, if they 'wished to do so, to sink shafts in the High Seas, join them together with buoys and ropes and claim exclusive rights within the area thus enclosed ? 11. Mr. Baggallay said that it was considered to be legally possible in certain circumstances to stake a claim to the bed of the sea as opposed to its surface. The pearl fishers in the Persian Gulf might be said to have acquired prescriptive rights to certain banks in the High Seas, and he believed that some of the Cornish tin mines extended out to sea beyond the three mile limit and that His Majesty’s Government claimed that the tin deposits which lay under the sea outside the three mile limit could be and had been appropriated. But these were both examples of rights acquired as the result of exclusive enjoyment and possession during a long period of time.6. The general theory was that the High Seas could not he appropriated hy States or individuals and though he thought that there might be nothing to prevent the Company from boring anywhere they liked in the bed of the sea below the High Seas, so long as they did not thereby interfere 'with navigation or fisheries, it seemed to him very doubtful if they would be able to shut off a larger area than they needed for each shaft and claim exclusive rights within that area. In other words they would not be able to appropriate an entire oil formation below the High Seas or prevent anybody else from sinking shafts adjoining their own. If, on the other hand, nobody else did in fact sink any shafts, they might in course of time acquire a prescriptive right to such a formation. 12. In conclusion, Mr. Mylies and his colleagues emphasised the fact that the question was far from being academic. Their researches pointed to the probability that five or six large oil fields mighe lie somewhere in the region comprised by the flat country at the head of the Persian Gulf and the adjacent sea and in a few years it nighb be technically possible to tap the fields under the sea through even greater depths of water than at present. It was quite possible that in about ten years they might wish to start operations in parts of the sea-bed lying as far as twelve miles from the Persian Coast at the northern end of the Persian Gulf.

To the honourable National Consultative Assembly: In order that the limits of frontier waters of the State, and of zones of control of the Government in the sea may be defined, and in order to avoid certain micunderstandingc I now submit, and request the acceptance of, a bill containing eight articles which specifies the limits of frontier waters and of the control of the government in the seas of Persia. First Chapter : On territorial waters and zones of control: Article I . That portion of the sea which extends along the coast up to the distance of six nautical miles from the coasts of Persia, reckoned from the lov/est tides, is accounted Persian territorial water, and in this zone whatever is situated below the bottom of the sea, on the surface of the sea, and above it, belongs to the State of Persia. Moreover, in regard to the execution of certain law's and agreements relating to security, defence, national interests, or to the preservation of shipping routes, another Zone, which shall be named the Zone of Naval Control, and shall be such that the Imperial Government shall have/2. have the right of control therein, shall extend parallel to the coast to a distance of twelve nautical miles from the limit of the lo\/est tide. Remark : A nautical mile is equivalent to 1,852 metres. Article II : 7ith regard to hays (or 'little gulfs') the boundary 0.1 territorial waters shall begin from a straight line joining tne outermost point of one side of the bay to the outermost point of the other side of the bay: and if the width of the mouth of the bay is more than ten nautical miles, ti.e line of bhe territorial waters snail oe situated at the nearest part of tne union of the bay with the sea, that part being such that its breadth does not exceed ten nautical miles. T/lth regard to ports, the limit of territorial waters will begin from a line lying between the permanent buildings of tne port which are the furthest advanced in the direction of the sea. Arti.cle III. Every island which belongs to Persia shall have special territorial waters of its own, the limits of which will ou determined in accordance with the arrangements laid down in Article 1 (the first portion). In regard to an archipelago the islands which compose it shall be regarded as a single island, ' ana tne distance of the territorial waters of the archipelago small be reckoned from those islands which are furthest from the centre of the archipelago. Second Chapter: The conditions of entry and anchorage war-ships in Persian waters, and the arrangements laid of foreign down for them: Article IV./3 .■vrticle IV. Foreign war-shipa and submarines, on condition z-n that they travel on the surface of the v/ater, have the right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of Persia, “unless the above-mentioned ships belong to States which are at war, in which case the national and international dispositions which are laid down for times of war and for the safeguarding of neutrality will be put into force. The conditions of transit for war-ships, alluded to in the first portion of this article, shall be defined in a special Regulation, particularly with regard to the fixation of the number of those ships. Article V. The conditions of anchorage of foreign warships in Persian territorial waters shall also be determined in a special Regulation. The above-mentioned ships must observe, while in the waters alluded to in t is Law, the Laws and Regulations of Persia. A rticle VI . The Government may, on grounds of national protection, or for other important causes, prohibit the transit or anchorage of foreign warships in certain ports or in portions of territorial waters. The above-mentioned ports and portions will be named 'Forbidden Zones'. Article VI I. Foreign war-ships, on condition of reciprocity, will be exempt from customs inspection, and customs duties will be charged only on those goods which are imported from the above-mentioned ships to the coast for consumption. The above-mentioned ships, on condition of reciprocity, will be exempt from port dues, tonnage dues, and similar imposts. Article VIII . The examination of misdemeanours ( junheh ) and crimes ( janayat ) which may take place on foreign war -ships are outside/4. outside the jurisdiction of Persian courts. Sentences of capital punishment which may be pronounced by foreign courts must not be executed in Persian territorial waters or zones of control.

The question has been discussed at an interdepartmental meeting, a note of which is enclosed for your information, at which advantage was taken of the presence of Mr. Belgrare in this country to obtain his views. In the light of this discussioi^ we have come to the conclusion that, for the following reasons, the best course would be to advise the Sheikh to suspend negotiations and postpone a decision sine die . d) 6837 Wt 34001/249 10,000 1.38 It will be seen that in Mr. Belgrave’s opinion the Sheikh himself would welcome a proposal to this effect, • » » and that his family would raise no objection. The Sheikh is no doubt satisfied with the very large income which he obtains from his present royalties, and consequently has little motive on the pecuniary side for desiring to grant a further concession. On the other hand, he and his family appear/appear to 'be deeply impressed by the implied threat of the Bahrein Petroleum Company that, if another concessionaire is introduced into his t f' Geminiorts, they may for that reason slow down their production on their present concession. It seems in fact improbable that the Company,in deciding on their production policy would be / influenced by other than ordinary commercial motives, especially in view of the large amount of money v/hich they have already sunk in Bahrein and their presumable desire to keep and extend their markets. But in view of the largd interests which are at stake from the Sheikh’s point of view, it seems improbable that it would be possible to persuade him that the Company’s threat can be discounted, however likely it may be that it is a bluff. Moreover, if for technical or commercial reasons the B.P.C. did find it necessary or advisabl to reduce their production of Bahrein oil, and if the Sheikh had meanwhile, or. the advice of H. M. G. , given a concessior. to another Company, the Sheikh would no doubt connect the one event v/ith the other, and might be inclined to impute the blame to the advice v/hich we had given him. The Sheikh’s main preoccupation at present is evidently to avoid any action which he fears might induce the B. P. C. to slow down production/Draft Paper Department. 7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38 to/ O production, while at the same time, he wishes so far as possible, to keep on good terms with both Companies and comply with the wishes of H.M.G. It seems not unlikely, therefore, that, as Mr. Belgrave is confident would be the case, he would welcome a proposal to leave the whole question dormant. (ii) Postponement would be acceptable to H.M.G. We should have time to see the effect of developments in Hasa. We are, moreover, committed to giving some assistance to P.C.L. in the Persian Gulf area, e.g. , on the Trucial Coast, and the giving of a new and costly concession to their rivals in Bahrein might well increase the difficulties of their negotiations with the Trucial Sheikhs. Furthermore, if -B.P.C. now obtained I portions of unallotted area which P.C.L. desire, latter would have a grievance against us on the ground that, as they are aware, Sheikh had practically decided on a division of the area coinciding with their v/ishes, and that it was in the expectation of this that they refrained from sending a negotiator and agreed to our request not to send Holmes. (iii) From the point of view of the Companies it may perhaps be hoped that B.P.C. would acquiesce in the proposed ! decision, since their main object seemsbe to avoid the introduction of a rival Company. P.C.L. would probably be disappointed and aggrieved, but their grievance would be less acute than if the concession which they seek were given to their rivals. I I think it would be desirable, however, if the Sheikh is disposed to favour postponement, to allow P.C.L. an opportunity to express their views to me before final orders are passed, j At this stage, therefore, it seems desirable in the first instance to ascertain how the Sheikh would view a proposal to postpone a decision, and, if you see no objection, you should instruct Political Agent to sound him orally on this suggestion. This will mean waiting until the Sheikh returns to Bahrein from Kashmir and as there must therefore be some delay in any case, you may think it preferable to postpone any discussion with the Sheikh until after Belgrave’s return from leave. The Political Agent might state that H.M.G. have now considered the whole matter most carefully. In view of the strongly worded remonstrance from the B.P.C,, they understand H.H. ! s reluctance to carry ou 1 : a plan v/hich we now learn would be so dista&amp;eful to a Company already established in Bahrein and working there so successfully. We appreciate Sheikh’s desire/Draft Paper Department, ■&gt; desire to avoid possibility of friction between t he two Companies. As regards any risk that the B.P.C. might slow down production because a concession had been given to another Company, we ourselves, for the reasons indicated above, do not think it likely that the Company’s policy in regard to production would be influenced by such a consideration. We quite appreciate his anxiety, however, to avoid any such risk, in view of the great interests at stake. His Highness no doubt is satisfied with his present income from royalties, and, so long as this is not jeopardised, we imagine that it is comparatively , immaterial to him, from the pecuniary point of view, whether or not he grants a further concession. We also believe that i he would desire so far as possible to avoid causing unnecessary disappointment to P.C.L. who, we fear, would by no means be satisfied with a division which gave them only the Hawar Islands. In all the circumstances, it seems to H. M.G.I as* /'iVP have wr^duutJt/ II.II. will that the simplest and best course be to inform the Companies that he has decided to suspend negotiations and postpone a decision sine die . This would relieve the B.P.C. of their fear of the I | introduction of a rival: and, though P.C.L./ft. P£ £U ' P.C.L. v/ould be disappointed, their disappointment would not be so great as if a decision were taken contrary to their wishes; while H # H. and H.M.G. will have time to see how matters develop, in regard particularly to oil in Hasa. A communication to the Companies in this sense would not, of course, preclude H.H. from re-opening the matter at the first favourable opportunity jDiiPolitical Agent should ^ explain that his present object is ftjl merely to consult with tho / aiie±kfr and \ that H.M.G. do not suggest that he should send a reply to the Companies 1 letters of 8th June until they have learnt his views on the above proposal when they will make a further communication to him.DRAFT X uc ^ Note of a meeting held at the India Office on Thursday, 7th July, 1938, to discuss On Concessions in the Bahrein Unallotted Area. PRESEN. Mr. Mr. Mr. J. C. Fa 11 o n (C ha i rma n) R. T. Peel J. P. Gibson ) ) India Office Mr. Mr. T.V. Brenan H.M. Eyres j Foreign Office Maio r G.W.M. Grover, R. M. Mr. P.H. Jones \ { Admiralty / Mr. F.C. Starling Petroleum Department Mr. Belgrave (Adviser to the Sheikh of Bahrein) was present during part of the proceedings. Mr. Walton opened the meeting Toy summarising the history of the negotiations up to the present. Some two years ago 'both P.C.L. and the B. P. C. had sought to obtain from the Sheikh of Bahrein a concession over the whole of the Unallotted Area. The Sheikh at the time contemplated a division of the Unallotted Area between the two Companies, but subsequently, in May 1937, decided to suspend the negotiations for a year. At the close of the period the Sheikh, in order to avoid a process of bargaining with the two Companies, decided to settle in advance, subject to the approval of H.M. G. , a division of the area and the terms required therefor and to communicate his intentions to the Companies. It transpired that under the scheme of division which .he had in mind the share of P.C.L. corresponded closely with the area which that Company themselves were proposing to ask for, since it conceded to them the outlying islands and shoals and to B.P.C. the remainder of the two main islands. While the Sheikh’s proposals were being considered in London, Mr. Thornberg/2. Thornberg let the Sheikh know, through Mr, Belgrave, that B.P.C. would view the concession of the whole or part of the area to another Company with very great dislike. Further, he dropped a broad hint that if it took place the Company might slow down production on their present concession. The Sheikh and his family were much alarmed at this threat and the Sheikh showed a disposition to go back on his proposed scheme of division. In order to clarify the position he was advised, on our instructions, to communicate his scheme of division to the Companies in writing and invite their views and any offers they might like to make. The Sheikh did so on 8 th June, and the local representatives of both Companies replied on the same day. B.P.C. indicated the extreme disfavour with which they viewed any division of the area and repeated in a veiled form the threat of slowing down production. They made an offer for the whole area which included a high initial payment of 4 lakhs. P.C.L. made no advance on their previous financial terms; as regards the division of areas proposed, they suggested certain adjustments but on the whole seemed satisfied with the Sheikh’s scheme. The Political Agent, through whom the correspondence v/as conducted, invited the Sheikh’s views in order that the matter might be submitted for the orders of H.M.C, The Sheikh replied the next day, 9th June, and indicated that he wished to abandon the original scheme and give the whole area with the exception of the Hawar Islands to B. P. C. He v/as obviously under the influence of the Company’s threat. The matter was at this stage submitted for the instructions of H. M. G. Mr. Walton said it was difficult to tell whether B.P.C. ’s/3 . B.P.C.’s threat was entirely “bluff or not. If the Sheikh were only concerned in choosing 'betweenthe terms offered 'by the Companies it might he a question which of their offers was the more favourable, since the higher initial payment of the B.P.C.’s offer might he balanced by the higher minimum royalty offered by P.C.L. But obviously it was not such considerations but the threat of slowing down present production that weighed with the Sheikh. i 1 he current year’s rate of production brought him in an income of some 30-35 lakhs. Mr. Peel mentioned that according to Mr. Belgrave the Sheikh and his family feared that the American Company would be naturally tempted to divert their energies to working the Hasa concession through the uncertainty of the prospect that conditions in Hasa would remain stable in the event of Ibn Baud's death. Mr. Starling thought that for economic reasons it was most unlikely that the Company would voluntarily slow down their production in Bahrein. They are believed to have sunk a large sum of money - a sum of four or five million had been mentioned - in Bahrein which they would naturally be anxious to recover, and they would want to keep and extend the markets available to them through the Texas organisation. They might, of course, find themselves unable to maintain the present rate of production, since he understood there were reports of water being encountered in some of the wells and it might be that the oil field was not as good as had been expected. Mr. Belgrave was introduced to the meeting at this point and various aspects of the matter were discussed with him. He confirmed that the Sheikh and his family were genuinely afraid that the B.P.C. would carry out their threat. He recognised that on commercial and technical grounds/4 grounds it v/as probable that the threat was very largely bluff, but he believed that it would be impossible to get the Sheikh to appreciate this argument and dismiss his fears. As regards the risks of friction between the two Companies, of which B.P.C. had made much account, he did not himself think the risks were serious under the Sheikh's original scheme of division. He enquired whether there was any possibility of a friendly agreement between the two Companies, but Mr. Starling said this was not to be expected in view of the rivalry between the American group in P.C. L. and the Standard Oil Company of California. Mr. Belgrave said that while the Sheikh was not in any need of more money which would influence him in giving a concession in the rest of his territory, he would be seriously affected by a substantial reduction in his present income. Mr. Belgrave explained how it was proposed that this income should be utilised; for the Sheikh’s privy purse, for expenditure (about 6 lakhs) on improvement of the adminis tra tio n social services, etc., and for the building up of a leserve fund. When asked how the Sheikh would view a suggestion that the negotiations might be suspended, he expressed the opinion that the Sheikh would himself be very pleased, and that his family, who were satisfied with the income they now received from him, would raise no objection. At present they, like the Sheikh, were in favour of closing with the B.P.C., though they were prepared to give Hawar to P.C.L. There was no truth in the suggestion that the Sheikh was disposed to give Hawar to P.C.L. from a fear that if he did not H.M.G. might be influenced to decide the question of the ownership of Hawar in favour of Qatar. Mr. Belgrave added that he thought the Sheikh would be willing to give Fasht/5. (ISO) Fasht Ditoal as v/ell as the Ha war Islands to P.C.L. ; this might help to simplify possible operations.in the sea bed outside territorial waters between Bahrein and Qatar. In reply to Mr. Jones, M r . Eelgrave said he thought it would be possible for P.C.L. to erect a refinery on Hauar if they wished. Mr. Jones said that the Admiralty would prefer that any refinery erected by P.C.L. should, for defence reasons, be situated in Bahrein Island, and considered that, whatever division was decided, the right should De reserved to P.C.L. to erect a Refinery in Bahrein should they wish. Mr. Belgrave said that if H.M.G. should decide that the Sheikh’s original scheme of division should be carried out the Sheikh would of course not refuse to comply. A consideration which had been in the Sheikh’s mind was the possibility, if his original scheme were enforced, of obtaining from P.C.L. a guarantee to indemnify him against any loss he might suffer if B.P.C. put their threat into execution. Mr. Belgrave agreed that it would be almost impossible to work this out or to expect the Company to give such a guarantee. Mr. Starling said he was very much opposed to the method of auctioneering into which the negotiations threatened to develop. He explained to Mr. Belgrave that the general practice, at least outside the U.S.A., where most of the oil is in private ownership, was for Government to settle in advance the terms on which concessions could be given and to decide between competitors by their opinion as to which was the better Company. He felt strongly that to allow N the Companies to bid against one another for the Sheikh’s favour w'ould have most unfortunate repercussions on oil negotiations elsewhere, both in the Persian Gulf and much further afield. Mr. Walton then thanked Mr. Belgrave for his great assistance, and the latter left the meeting. Mr./6. tsD Mr. Walton expressed the view that it would apparently he very difficult to persuade the Sheikh that he could without risk let P.C.L. in. Although Mr. Belgrave had said that the Sheikh would accept P.C.L. f s offer if pressed to do so ? it would not he vise to force it on him. Mr. Brenan said that if the Sheikh were now to give P.C.L. what they wanted there would he a possibility of representations being made by the United States Government accusing H. M.G. of showing discrimination against their nationals and of influencing the Sheikh against his own expressed wish. Mr. Starling remarked that it must he remembered on the other hand that there was an American group in P.C.L. Major Grover informed the meeting that the Admiralty were strategically interested in the development of oil in Bahrein, though the quality was not entirely satisfactory since it contained a high sulpher content, hut in the event of war it would he of the utmost value, and therefore the Admiralty would dislike anything that tended to slow down production of oil in Bahrein. They thought that the best solution would he for B.P.C. to get a concession minus the Hawar Island and possibly Fasht Dihal. The Admiralty would like, if possible, a pre-emption clause put in the agreement. Mr. Jones enquired as to the possibility of a revision of the existing Agreement in this connection. Mr. Walton suggested that it would be reasonable to make a condition of the grant of the Unallotted Area to the B.P.C. that some of the terms of the existing concession as well as the new one should be revised. If war comes we should have no difficulty in persuading the Sheikh to exercise sovereignty powers, but it might be better to have/have revision and so avoid the possibility of complaints from the American Government. A condition might he made also that the hulk of the oil should he refined in Bahrein which the Admiralty consider desirable from the defence point of view. Mr. Walton felt, however, that prohahly the best solution of the problem would he to advise the Sheikh to postpone a decision sine die. This would enable him and H.M.G. to see how things develop, and would not preclude the re-opening of the subject at a later stage. The meeting saw no objection to this proposal and Mr. Starling said that an argument in its favour which impressed him was that the enhanced prestige of the American Company if they now obtained the concession would have unfortunate repercussions on the negotiations which P.C.L. were conducting with the Trucial Sheikhs. A waiting period would also give time to test the effect of the development of the new Hasa oilfield on production in Bahrein. It was accordingly decided to recommend that action on these lines should be taken and that a carefully worded communication, on which the Departments concerned should he consulted, should he made to the Sheikh to enable him to reply to the letters from the two Companies.CONFIDENT I A L Military Branch, 24th August, 1938. i* 3 80F «•*-(* i mz Dear Gibson, ^^ Will you please refer to your letter of the 1st June, 1938, P.Z.3808/38, forwarding copies of Petroleum Concessions 1937 and 1938 draft agreements for the oil concession over the Bahrein unallotted Area. The draft concessions are considered generally satisfactory from the Admiralty point of view, subject to the following remarks. Preamble. M,03508/38. This allows for transfer of the concession to ’’its successors and assigns”. This is qualified in Article 23 by reference to ”any other Company registered in the British Empire”; but we assume that it will be made clear in the Political Agreement, in the usual way, that transfer will be permitted to British Companies only. Article I. It may be as well to remark now that the Hydrographer does not consider the description of the sea area in the 1938 draft to be satisfactory. We hope that you will give him an opportunity of expressing his expert opinion on the terms of any division that may ultimately be decided on. With regard to the Hawar Islands, we agree that the formula proposed by Beckett in his note of 22nd April, 1938 (Foreign Office letter to you, E 2288/413/91 of 25th April, 1938) meets the difficulty of the J.P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, S. W. 1. I m, BZPr. , ' 2/ AUG 1938 INDIA OFFICEthe disputed ownership satisfactorily. We also agree with the formula suggested in the same note for dealing v/ith the submerged lands outside territorial waters. Article 8, Defence sites will presumably be safeguarded in the usual way in the Political Agreement, It also appears necessary in the case of Bahrein for the interests of Imperial Airways to be fully safeguarded, and it seems preferable for a suitable clause to be incorporated in the comraercial agreement (as in the case of Sharjah), This seems to be a matter on which the Air Ministry will have to be consulted. Article 9, We had decided to agree with the Petroleum Department’s proposal that, as a compromise, and in view of the difficulties of Petroleum Concessions Limited as newcomers in Bahrein, the period in which they would be required to commence drilling should be fixed at 4 years (vide Starling’s letter of 27th May, 1938), We do not desire to support Petroleum Concessions Ltd, in their attempt to extend the drilling period beyond the option period of 6 years. This however is a question which may need further consideration in the light of the circumstances prevailing when negotiations are re—opened. Oil Pollution, W e agree that a clause such as suggested by Starling in his letter of 27th May, 1938, should be inserted to guard against pollution of the sea by oil from the workings. Safety.We consider it important that clear provision shall he made in the concession safeguarding navigation from interference by oil workings. This applies particularly to waters outside territorial waters; but for the purposes of the present concession we think that one clause might cover waters both inside and outside territorial limits. We suggest for consideration the following The Company shall conduct all operations, whether for the winning of oil from submerged land, or for other purposes, in such a manner as to ensure the continued safety and freedom of navigation. In particular, such structures as the Company may erect shall be so placed that the free passage of vessels shall not be interfered with, they shall be lighted at the Co&amp;pany's expense, and both placing and lighting thereof shall be effected to the satisfaction of the Sheikh, I am sending copies of this letter to Starling and Eyres, Yours sincerely.

Dear Gihson, I am at last able to reply to your letter of the 19th July (P.3.4725/38) about the Bahrein Unallotted Area. The Board has now agreed to your proposal that the negotiations for the allocation of the Bahrein Unallotted Area shall he postponed sine die. We are, of course, anxious for strategical reasons that any oil that may he at Bahrein should he developed as soon as possible, but are prepared to accept the delay involved in a postponement of a decision in the interests of an ultimately satisfactory settlement at Bahrein and in the Persian Gulf generally. We have no objection to the record of the meeting of 7th July, except that we would prefer, on page 7, line 4, that the words 'if this were desirable' to read 'which the Admiralty considered desirable', and on page 5, at the end of the first paragraph, we would like inserted, for purposes of record:- 'Mr. Jones said that the Admiralty would prefer that any refinery erected by P.C.L. should, for defence reasons, be situated in Bahrein Island, and considered that, whatever division was decided, the right should be reserved to P.G.L. to erect a refinery in Bahrein should they wish'. With reference to Peel’s letter of the 2nd August, P.2.4723/33, we concur in the draft letter to the Political Resident, except that we would suggest that on page 3, first line of section (ii), 'would also suitf the interests of H.M.

They are as follows Page 3. lines 19 and 20 to read 'They had sunk a large sum of money - a sum of four or five million had been mentioned - in Bahrein etc.' As it stands it looks as if we have official information on this point which I know you appreciate is not so.

Yours sincerely, J. P. Gibson, Esq,The American-o^ned Bahrein Petroleum Co. has on oil concession in Bahrein covering most of the principal island, it is most productive and lucrative to the Sheikh, whose royalties this year are expected to be in the neighbourhood of Rs.30 lakhs. In 1936 t Petroleum Concessions Ltd., a partially British-owned company, and the Bahrein Co. were permitted to negotiate with the Sheikh for the remainder of the Bahrein islands (including outlying reefs and shoals, which P.C.L. are particularly anxious to obtain). In May 1937 the Sheikh decided to postpone negotiations for a year. At the end of this period he decided to divide the area in such a way as to give P.C.L. most of what they wish for, and the remainder, including the residue of the two main islands, to the B.P.C. When we were about to approve this proposal, which seemed a suitable settlement between the two Companies, the Bahrein Co. let the Sheikh know that they would very much dislike the introduction of a new company, and that the result might be (so they implied) that they would slow down production on their existing concession'. The Sheikh was/I rnatrltR .Hi ’N J &gt; was, not unnaturally, alarmed by this threat, though it may probably be a bluff. Acting on our advice, he communicated his proposed scheme of division to both Companies, not in the fora of a decision, as he had originally contemplated, but as a proposal on which he invited their views and offers. We advised him to take this course in order to obtain the viev/s of each'Company in writing. Both Companies delivered their replies the same day. That of the Bahrein Co. objects altogether to the introduction of a rival company, and makes an offer for the whole area. P.C.L. make an offer for the part of the area which they want. The Sheikh now proposes to give the Bahrein Co, the whole area, less the Hawar Islands, and give the latter to P.C.L., but has made no further communication to the Companies pending the advice of H.UI.Gr. &lt; A difficult question now arises owing to the Sheikh's sudden change of plan under the influence of the Bahrein Co.'s implied threat. We have to advise the Sheikh what course he should pursue, and there is no course which is altogether free from objection. It is submitted that the best course wouldbe, for the reasons stated in the attached draft express letter, to advise him to postpone the whole question. This, however, would be a disappointment to P.C.L., who were aware that the Sheikh, until the last moment, intended to divide the area in accordance with their wishes, and, in the expectation that this would occur, had refrained from sending a negotiator to Bahrein. (We had also asked them not to send a Major Holmes, whom they have previously employed in the Persian Gulf, because the Political Resident considered that his presence in Bahrein would be politically undesirable.) This Company would certainly, I think, feel an acute grievance if tho whale rrf the area were L now given to their rivals, and they may have a grievance if the question is postponed. Nevertheless, the latter solution seems to be the best in the circumstances; but it is suggested that, after sounding the Sheikh to see whether it meets his views (as Mr. Belgrave, his Adviser - now in this country - thinks it would) , but before passing final orders, P.C.L. should be informed, so that they may have an opportunity/7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38 t^/ Braft Paper.

I have had under consideration, in consultation with the other Depts. concerned, the correspondence resting with your express letter of 19th June, No. C/337, regarding the negotiations for an &lt; oil concession in the Bahrein unallotted area. The question has been discussed at an interdepartmental meeting, a note of which is enclosed for your information, and at which advantage was taken of the presence of Ur. Belgrave in this country to obtain his views. In the light of this discussion we have come to the conclusion that, for the following reasons, the best course would be to advise the Sheikh to c suspend negotiations and postpone a decision sine die . (i N It will be seen that in Mr. c Belgrave's opinion the Sheikh himself would welcome a proposal to this effect, and that his family would raise no objection. The Sheikh is no doubt satisfied with the very large income which he obtains from his present royalties, and consequently has little motive on the pecuniary side for desiring to grant a further concession. On the other hand, he and his family appear to be deeply impressed by the implied threat of the Bahrein Petroleum 7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38Co. that, if another concessionaire is introduced into his dominions, they may for that reason slow down their production on their present concession. It seems in fact improbable that the Coy. in deciding on their production policy would be influenced by other than ordinary coinmercial motives, especially in view of the large amount of money which they have already sunk in Bahrein and their presumable desire to keep and extend their markets. But in view of the large interests which are at stake from the Sheikh’s point of view, it seems improbable that it would be possible to persuade him that the Co.’s threat can be discounted, however likely it may be that it is a bluff. Moreover, if for technical or commercial reasons the B.P.C. did find it necessary or advisable to reduce J their production of Bahrein oil, and if the Sheikh had meanwhile, on the advice of H.M.G-,, given a concession to another company, the Sheikh would no doubt connect the one event with the other, and might be inclined to impute the blame to the advice which we had given him. The Sheikh’s main preoccupationa at present to avoid any action which he fears might induce the B.P.C. to slow ^ u down oroduction aftd at the same time, so i j h \ far as possible, to keep on good terms with/Department.

It seems not , .unnrutHjipg^ therefore, that, as Mr. Belgrave is confident would be the case, he JpMiai welcome a GUiarsr-on to leave the whole question dormant. (yL fiM** £ (ii) Postponement woulci/_also suit the-4nterests of|H.M.G. We should have time to see the effect of developments in Hasa. We are, moreover, committed to giving some assistance to P.C.L. in the Persian Gulf area, e.g., on the Trucial Coast, and the giving of a new and costly concession to their rivals in Bahrein might well increase the difficulties of their negotiations 'dth the Trucial Sheikhs. Furthermore, if 3.P.C. now obtained portions of t s unallotted area which P.C.L.desire, latter would have a grievance against us on the ground that, as they are aware, Sheikh had practically decided on a, division of the area coinciding with' their wishes, and that it was in the expectation of this that they refrained from sending a negotiator and agreed to our request not to send Holmes. T on the other hand, if P.C.L. were given the concession which they desire, there might be possibility of representations being made by the United States Govt, on the ground,that we had advised the Sheikh against/ 7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38against his own wishes to the disadvantage of their nationals.J (iii) From the point of view of the Companies it may perhaps be hoped that B.P.C.would acquiesce in the proposed decision, since their main object seems to be to avoid the introduction of a rival company. P.C.L. would probably be disappointed and aggrieved, but their grievance would be less acute than if the concession which they seek were given to their rivals. &lt; I think it would be desirable, however, if the Sheikh is disposed to favour postponement,to allow P.C.L. an opportunity to express their views to me before final orders are passed.

H.H. no doubt is satisfied with his present income from royalties, and, so long as this is not jeopardised,,it is comparatively immaterial to him / from the pecuniary point of view, whether or not he grants a further concession. We also believe that he would desire so far as possible to avoid causing unnecessary disappointment to P.C.L. who, we fear, would by no means be satisfied with a division which gave them only the Hawar Islands. In all the circumstances, it seems to , and we have no doubt H.H. will agree, that the simplest and best course would be to inform the Companies that he has decided to suspend negotiations and postpone a decision sine die .

Starling Petroleum Department Mr. Belgrave (Adviser to the Sheikh of Bahrein) v/as present during part of the proceedings. Mr. Walton opened the meeting hy summarising the history of the negotiations up to the present. Some two years ago Both P.C.L. and the B.P.C. had sought to obtain from the Sheikh of Bahreiii a concession over the whole of the Unallotted Area. The Sheikh at the time contemplated a division of the Unallotted Area 'between the two Companies, but subsequently, in May 1937, decided to suspend the negotiations for a year. At the close of the period the Sheikh, in order to avoid a process of bargaining with the two Companies, decided to settle in advance, subject to the approval of H.M.G. , a division of the area and the terms required therefor and to communicate his intentions to the Companies. It transpired that under the scheme of division which he had in mind the share of P.C.L. corresponded closely with the area which that Company themselves were proposing to ask for, since it conceded to them the outlying islands and shoals and to B.P.C. the remainder of the two main islands. While the Sheikh’s xjroposals were being considered in London, Mr. Thornberg/2. ThoTriberg let the Sheikh know, through Mr. Belgrave, that B.P.C. would view the concession of the whole or part of the area to another Company with very great dislike. Further, he dropped a broad hint that if it took place the Company might slow down production on their present concession. The Sheikh and his family were much alarmed at this threat and the Sheikh showed a disposition to go back on his proposed scheme of division. In order to clarify the position he was advised, on our instructions, to communicate his scheme of division to the Companies in writing and invite their views and any offers they might like to make. The Sheikh did so on 8th June, and the local representatives of both Companies replied on the same day. B.P.C. indicated the extreme disfavour with which they viewed any division of the area and repeated in a veiled form the threat of slowing down production. They made an offer for the whole area which included a high initial payment of 4 lakhs. P.C.L. made no advance on their previous financial terms’ as regards the division of areas proposed, they suggested certain adjustments but on the whole seemed satisfied with the Sheikh’s scheme. The Political Agent, through whom the correspondence was conducted, invited the Sheikh’s views in order that the matter might be submitted for the orders of H.M.G. The Sheikh replied the next day, 9th June, and indicated that he wished to abandon the original scheme and give the whole area with the exception of the Hawar Islands to B.P.C. He was obviously under the influence of the Company’s threat. The matter was at this stage submitted for the instructions of H.M.G. Mr. Walton said it was difficult to tell whether B.P.C. ’s/3. B.P,C.’s threat was entirely bluff or not. If the Sheikh were only concerned in choosing between the terras offered by the Companies it might be a question which of their offers v/as the more favourable, since the higher initial payment of the B.P.C.'s offer might be balanced by the higher minimum royalty offered by P.C.L. But obviously it was not such considerations but the threat of slowing down present production that weighed with the Sheikh. The current year’s rate of production brought him in an income of some 30-35 lakhs. Mr. Peel mentioned that according to Mr. Belgrave the Sheikh and his family feared that the American Company would be naturally tempted to divert their energies to working the Hasa concession through the uncertainty of the prospect that conditions in Hasa would remain stable in the event of Ibn Saud’s death. Mr. Starling thought that for economic reasons it was most unlikely that the Company would voluntarily slow down their production in Bahrein. They had sunk a large sum of money - some four or five millions - in Bahrein which they would naturally be anxious to recover, and they would want to keep and extend the markets available to them through the Texas organisation. They might, of course, find themselves unable to maintain the present rate of production, since he understood there were reports of water being encountered in some of the wells and it might be that the oil field was not as good as had been expected. Me. Belgrave was introduced to the meeting at this point and various aspects of the matter were discussed with him. He confirmed that the Sheikh and his family were genuinely afraid that the B.P.C. would carry out their threat. He recognised that on commercial and technical grounds/4. grounds it was probable that the threat was very largely bluif, but he believed that it would be impossible to get the Sheikh to appreciate this argument and dismiss his fears. As regards the risks of friction between the two Companies,, of which B.P.C. had made much account, he did not himself think the risks were serious under the Sheikh’s original scheme of division. He enquired 'whether there was any possibility of a friendly agreement between the two Companies, but Mr. Starling said, this was not to be expected in view of the rivalry between the American group in P.C.L. and the Standard Oil Company of California. Mr. Belgrave said that while the Sheikh was not in any need of more money which would influence him in giving a concession in the rest of his territory, he would be seriously affected by a substantial reduction in his present income. Mr. Belgrave explained how it was proposed that this income should be utilised; for the Sheikh’s privy purse, xor expenditure (about 6 lakhs) on improvement of the administration , social services, etc., and for the building up of a reserve fund. When asked how the Sheikh would view a suggestion that the negotiations might be suspended, he expressed the opinion that the Sheikh would himself be very pleased, and that his family, who were satisfied with the income they now 7 received from him, would raise no objection. At present they, like the Sheikh, were in favour of closing with the B.P.C., though they were prepared to give Hawar to P.C.L. There was no truth in the suggestion that the Sheikh was disposed to give Hawar to P.C.L. from a fear that if he did not H. M. G. might be influenced to decide the question of the ownership of Hawar in favour of Qatar. Mr. Belgrave added that he thought the Sheikh would be willing to give Fasht/fp'' L-M* S&amp;iM, lb Ai\mifyulij jv^jM fto/- nju.,.. &lt;*uJfr L P‘L *b~U, {” Pp^- ■ Qa* M 4 * , ^V-A/XMiOj ^ ! /&gt; jl *.*) !Anb i&gt;hJtZr&lt;+ kjtM* ^- rAf ‘ (W/WiJtAJLd /a&gt;&lt; i y ^ ^x^MsUas*-' / ' A4A ' ^ k V''''' '' ' . / ■* / ?'/’/ /' OxS-^ ^c fct gtwJ ^ fc ^ .

In reply to Mr. Jones 7 Mr. Belgrave said he thought it would be possible for P.C.L. to erect a refinery on Hawar if they wished. /A Mr. Belgrave said that if H.M.G. should decide that the Sheikh’s original scheme of division should be carried out the Sheikh would of course not refuse to comply. A consideration which had been in the Sheikh’s mind was the possibility;, if his original scheme were enforced, of obtaining from P.C.L. a guarantee to indemnify him against any loss he might suffer if B.P.C. put their threat into execution. Mr. Belgrave agreed that it would be almost impossible to work this out or to expect the Company to give such a guarantee. Mr. Starling said he was very much opposed to the method of auctioneering into which the negotiations threatened to develop. He explained to Mr. Belgrave that the general practice, at least outside the U.S.A., was for Government to settle in advance the terms on which concessions could be given and to decide between competitors by their opinion as to which was the better ’ Company. He felt strongly that to allow the Companies to oid against one another for the Sheikh’s favour would have most unfortunate repercussions on oil negotiations elsewhere, both in the Persian Gulf and much further afield. Mr. Yifalton then thanked Mr. Belgrave for his great assistance, and the latter left the meeting. Mr. Walton expressed the view that it would apparently/6 . C 3 g) apparently Toe very difficult to persuade the Sheikh that he could without risk let P.C.L. in. Although Mr. Belgrave had said that the Sheikh would accept P.C.L.’s offer if pressed to do so, it would not he wise to force it on him. Mr. Brenan said that if the Sheikh were now to give P.C.L. what they wanted there would he a possibility of representations being made by the United States Government accusing H.M.G. of showing discrimination against their nationals and of influencing the Sheikh against his own expressed wish. Mr. Starling remarked that it must be remembered on the other hand that there was an American group in P.C.L. Major Grover informed the meeting that the Admiralty were strategically interested in the development of oil in Bahrein, though the quality was not entirely satisfactory since it contained a high sulpher content, but in the event of war it would be of the utmost value, and therefore the Admiralty would dislike anything that tended to slow down production of oil in Bahrein. They thought that the best solution would be for B.P.C, to get a concession minus the Hawar Island and possibly Pasht Dibal. The Admiralty would like, if possible, a pre-emption clause put in the agreement. Mr. Jones enquired as to the possibility of a revision of the existing Agreement in this connection. Mr. Walton suggested that it would be reasonable to make a condition of the grant of the Unallotted Area to the B.P.C. that some of the terms of the existing concession as well as the new one should be revised. If war comes we should have no difficulty in persuading the Sheikh to exercise sovereignty powers, but it might be better to have/yii trv 7. have revision and so avoid the possibility of complaints from the American Government. A condition might he made also that the hulk of the oil should he refined in Bahrein - fif this were] desirable from the defence point of view. Mr. Walton felt, however, that probably the best solution of the problem would be to advise the Sheikh to postpone a decision sine die . This would enable him and H.M.G. to see how things develop, and would not preclude the re-opening of the subject at a later stage. The meeting saw no objection to this proposal and Mr. Starling said that an argument in its favour which impressed him was that the enhanced prestige of the American Company if they now obtained the concession would have unfortunate repercussions on the negotiations which P.C.L. were conducting with the Trucial Sheikhs. A waiting period would also give time to test the effect of the development of the new Hasa oilfield on production in Bahrein. It 'was accordingly decided to recommend that 4 action on these lines should be taken and that a carefully worded communication, on which the Departments concerned should be consulted, should be made to the Sheikh to enable him to reply to the letters from the tw j&gt; Companies.0/ OIL CONCESSIONS III BArlREIH UFALLOTT5L AR5A. Alternative courses for consideration. C7-7.3S) A. (1) To fall in with the Shaikh’s latest view (letter of 9th June), viz. to give Petroleum Concessions Limited the Hawar Islands and Bahrein Petroleum Concessions the rest. Pro Will avoid friction Between two competing companies in close proximity in the Bahrein Islands. - Will dispel the Sheikh’s fears of retaliation by B.P.C. Will probably benefit the Sheikh financially. Pre-emption agreement for whole area •may be possible. C on Undesirable extension of American interests. Embarrassment with directorate of P.C.L. - Added prestige of Standard Oil Company will influence Trucial Coast Sheikhs and make P.C.L.’s negotiations with them more difficult. A. (2) As a variant of A(l), to pursue Mr.Belgrave’s suggestion to give Pasht Libal as well as Hawar Islands to P.C.L., and the rest to B.P.C. Pro’s and Con’s as before, except that this arrangement would be less unpalatable to P.C.L. B. To keep negotiations in being, so as to allow P.C.L. opportunity to make a competitive bid for the whole area (excluding main island, except as regards suriace rights). Pro Would allow Sheikh to obtain the greatest financial benefit. - Would allow P.C.L. a further run before the final decision is given. Con : - Petroleum Department have expressed the objections to this extension of the bargaining process as leading to inflated payments which would have a prejudicial effect on negotiations els ewhere. Would not remove the real issue, dealt with under A (l).2 . (l) Decide forthwith that P.C.L. should he given what the Sheikh originally proposed. Pro Would give British interests a fair deal. Would assist the Company in their Trucial Coast negotiations. - Would prohahly have some strategical advantages in respect of the supply of oil ♦ Con Friction between B.P.C. and P.C.L. - Bisk of retaliation by B.P.C. detrimental to the Sheikh’s interests. A certain, though not excessive, difficulty with the Sheikhly family. Possibility that the supply of oil for service purposes might really be more secure and efficient in the hands of one organisation (the B.P.C.) covering the whole area of Bahrein. C. (2) Decide to give P.C.L. what they originally asked for (This includes surface rights on the main island,. Pro’s and con’s as for C(l) witn the additional objection that this would increase the risk of friction and trouble between the two Companies. D. Close down negotiations for one or two years. Pro Would save embarrassment for the time being and would apparently be welcomed by the Sheikh himself. The degree of progress made in the Hasa oilfield in the meantime might throw some light on the question whether the B.P.C.would carry out their threat of retaliation in Bahrein. (The threat would turn out to be mere bluff, probably, if the Hasa oilfield were a failure). Con Much the same problem will have to ce faced at the end of the postponement, and it might as well be settled now. - P.C.L. may not welcome the decision.Sir. F, Stewart, You will like to see the Political Agent f s Express Letter of 10 June flagged, Mr. Peel*s note of an interviev; v/ith Mr. Belgrave on 22 June and Sir T. Fowle's views in his Express Letter of 19 June. The position now is that the Sheikh on 8 June informed each Company in writing of the scheme of division which he had under consideration. The representatives of the Companies replied next day (hy arrangement apparently with the Political Agent); this may have 'been unnecessarily hasty the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s letter is an offer for the whole area- that of P.C.L, is a repetition of their previous offer for part of the area (not quite the same as the Sheikh’s suggestion as it includes Muharraq). The Political Agent then asked the Sheikh for his preliminary reactions in order that he might report to H.M.G. and see what they advise. The Sheikh in a letter of 9 June states that he wishes to open negotiations with P.C.L. for the Hawar Islands and with the B. P.C. for the remainder of the area. Here again the procedure has been perhaps unnecessarily speedy, and it might have/3 whole or most of the area forthwith to B.P.C. (c) To act in accordance with the Sheikh’s preliminary views in his letter of 9 June. Sir T. Powle now favours this course, partly because he is impressed by B.P.O.’s implied threat to slow down production. As regards this, however, I should imagine that the Company’s piicy in regard to output would probably be guided by their coinmercial interests, i.e. that if a large output from Bahrein pays them they will continue to produce it, and if it pays them better to concentrate on Hasa they will do that / irrespective of what may happen about the oxtencion of their Bahrein concession. (d) As a variation of (c), to give P. C.L. Hasht Dibal as well as Hav/ar (a tentative suggestion throv/n out by Mr. Belgrave). (e) To postpone the whole question. Mr. Belgrave thinks that such a proposal would be received favourably by the Sheikh. Bst It would certainly relieve us of the necessity of a most troublesome decision,^ B. P. C. v/ould have no reason for proceeding with their threat/have been better if the Sheikh had taken more time for reflection. We now have to consider what advice to give to the Sheikh, for which purpose we had better in the first instance have an interdepartmental meeting. The following lines of advice to the Sheikh are the alternatives which seem worth considering:- (a) to continue negotiations with each Company and see what each would offer for areas divided in accordance with the Sheikh 1 s letter of 8 June. This would give P.C.L. an opportunity of improving their offer which at present compares unfavourably with that of B.P.C. for the whole area as regards lump sum payments, though the minimum annual payment which they offer would ultimately be higher than that offered by B.P. C. (b) To decide straightav/ay to give P.C.L. more or less v/hat they want. The Petroleum Department seem to be in favour of this course as they dislike the idea of a prolonged auction and would presumably dislike even more giving the whole/The Bahr ein Unallotted Area . I think; you should see these papers which show the latest developments over the Bahrein Unallotted Area. The Political Agent’s Express Letter of the 10th June explains v/hat happened. The Sheikh, acting in accordance with our advice, informed hoth Companies through his Adviser on the 8th June that he had under consideration the division of the Unallotted Area (on lines v/hich we regarded as suitable), and asked for the viev/s of the two Companies on this proposed division in v/riting and their offers. On receipt of their replies, however, he at once informed the Political Agent, in a letter dated 9th June, that he was not prepared to accept P.C.L. f s offer, nor was he prepared to accept the suggested division of areas, since such a division was not to his advantage. He therefore wished to open negotiations with P.C.L. for a concession over the Hawar Islands only, and to negotiate with Bapco for the remainder. He gave as the reason for his decision that he did not wish to endanger his revenues from oil by causing Bapco to reduce its work in Bahrein. i/threat to slow down production, if there is anything in that. On the other hand, P.C.L, might object hut not so strongly of course as they would object to a decision against them. Perhaps we might discuss the matter with Mr. PeelI saw Belgrave on the 22nd June and you will find helow a note of my interview with him, which throws some further light on the matter. It is clear from what he told me that the Sheikhly family are genuinely apprehensive of Bapco*s threats to go slow, and Belgrave himself is inclined to think there is something in it. You will notice that a postponement of the whole question would he received with relief by the Sheikh and his family. We have now had Fowle’s views on the question and he has come round to the opinion that we should inform the Sheikh that H.M.G. does not wish to interfere with his decision. The next step, no doubt, will be to hold an interdepartmental conference to decide wtat attitude is to be adopted by H.M.G. to the Sheikh* s proposals. You will see from Starling’s letter to me of the 16th June that his view is strongly in favour of insisting on giving P.C.L. what they want, and he suggests that if there is any doubt about this being done it may be necessary at some stage to raise the matter on the Oil Board. One/One further minor complication is the fact that P. G.L. have 'been labouring under the delusion that all they have to do now is to see Belgrave in London and fix up some minor point of detail, after which the Sheikh will sign on the dotted line. The origin of this misunderstanding lies in the fact that the Sheikh saw Skliros on the 5th June and then told him that he 7/ould not consider any offer from him except for the Hawar Group. Accordingly, when Skliros received the Adviser’s letter of the 8th June announcing that the Sheikh had under consideration a division of the area on the lines that P.C.L. wanted, they assumed that the Sheikh had made a complete volte face , possibly under pressure from H. M.G., and was now making a firm offer. Longrigg has been informed that this is very far from being the case and that the Sheikh had only put this division forward as a basis for negotiation. We may therefore shortly have enquiries from Lord Cadman as to what the present position is. I understand that Longrigg is seeing Belgrave to-morrow.-. ^ ** H La- Lc rlL- ['o C&gt;\X^ riLb GOVERNMENT OP INDIA. COKi’i o bstial Department. EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL).

I gathered from him that the sudden change from the original plan of tfcMi division of the area was brought about not by methods of bribery and corruption so much as by the threat of Bapco to go slow on their Bahrein concession and concentrate on their Saudi concession^if the Sheikh admits a rival company into the Bahrein Area. He said that the Sheikh* s brother Sheikh Mohammed returned to Bahrein after the original division had been suggested and that it was his influence that largely caused the Sheikh to change his mind. The fear of the Sheikhly family that Bapco’s threat was a real one was strengthened by their conviction,which is common all along the Trucial Coast that if Ibn Saud were to die his whole kingdom would split up,and consequently any oil concessions in Saudi Arabia might be extremely dangerous if not impossible to work. It seemed t* \Ljt, fc- vtsKu^u. I*, h (SKf l\f Itl, therefore/therefore highly probable to them that the American Company would take the line that they had better work their Saudi concession for all its worth while the going is good, whereas the Bahrein Area was always going to be safe and could be fully developed at any time. I asked Mr. Belgrave whether there was anything in Lord Cadma^s complaint that he had been handicapped by the absence of Major Holmes. He was most definite that Major Holmes 1 absence had made no difference whatever and entirely confirmed Sir Trenchard Powle's statements in his telegram on the question. He said that the Sheikh was undoubtedly very fond of Major Holmes and would always be pleased to see him, but his presence at Bahrein would have made no difference once the American Company had made their threat to go slow. I then asked Mr. Belgrave his own opinion on their proposed threat, and he said that he thought there was quite a possibility of its being carried out if not in the first year or so at any rate subsequently. As/r\ k As regards the question of possible friction between the two Companies, Mr. Belgrave said that there was no doubt that the Sheikh and his family were genuinely apprehensive of this and he thought that there would undoubtedly be some risk^if not a very serious one. He pointed out that Muharraq,on which it was proposed that P.C.L. should have rights, is a very small island and there might be some trouble there. Mr. Belgrave could not throw much light on Mr. Skliros 1 reported satisfaction with the offer of the Hawar group, except that he had been given to understand that it was the Hawar group in which P.C.L. were principally interested. He added that though Mr. Skliros had at first appeared to be satisfied with this offer, he had subsequently appeared to be not quite so pleased. T asked Mr. Belgrave one or two questions on points of detail as for instance v/hether the Sheikh were likely to waive the embargo on the piping of oil to Qatar or to extend the period of two years during wnich P.C.L. would be required to start drilling. He said that the Sheikhly f ami ly/family attached considerable importance to both these points, particularly the first one, owing to their feeling against Qatar which is at present very strong. The present position appears to be that the negotiations are now in suspense and are likely to remain so for the time being. Mr. Thorriberg in fact is due to go home almost immediately. I then asked Mr. Belgrave whether if H.M.G. came to the conclusion that the original plan of division should be adhered to the Sheikh would accept the advice of H.M.G. and he replied that he undoubtedly would. It might lead to a family row though not a very serious one, but the Sheikh would 0 simply take the line that he had been ordered by H.M.G. to divide the area in that way and there was no more to be said. Mr. Belgrave*s own personal opinion was that on the whole it would be the safer proposition looking at the matter simply from the point of view of what was best for Bahrein, to confine//* confine P.C.L. to the Hawar group and so avoid any com plications with the American Company. He made a suggestion which might perhaps he worth pursuing that it might he possible to give P.C.L. in addition to the Hawar group the small island of Pasht Dihal and a narrow strip of the shallow water running down from Pasht Dihal to Kawar. This would give P.C.L. some of the reefs wnich they are said to he keen on and also would keep them right away from the Americans on the main island and the reefs north of 'Jt In conclusion I asked him what would he the , effect of the decision to postpone any further negotiations for the Unallotted Area for a further period of one or two years. He said that hoth he himself and the Sheikh would he most relieved at such a decision. Bahrein did not need any more money at the present time and a postponement would remove for the time being a somewhat embarrassing situation.P. 2.4511/38.

Dear Peel, ^ith reference to your letter (PZ.3837/38) of 4tli June asking for our views on tlie developments reported in Bushire letter of. 28th May, I should prefer, in view of the developments since this letter was received, to reserve comment until we know more definitely the outcome of these later developments, especially of your proposal to obtain the views of the two companies on the original geographical division of the Unallotted Area which the Sheikh himself proposed. I would, however, like to repeat what I said to you over the telephone on 3rd June that I am disturbed at the prospect of a situation arising where there might be an open auction for the two areas. The terms arrived at might be completely out of proportion to the merits of the case and the repercussions in other parts of the world cannot be overlooked.

As I reminded you the inter ests are already fully represented in the Petroleum Concessions, Limited, and I J feel that we are on strong ground in resisting any further attempts by the Standard Oil Company of California to obtain additional areas in this part of the world. In view of what has happened in Mexico, where the U.S. State Department are not being very helpful, and the possibility that our oil interests may be attacked in other countries on lines similar to that taken in Mexico, I am sure that we ought to see to it that we look after ourselves in those parts of the world where we have control of the situation. At some stage I think this matter may have to be raised on the Oil Board if there is any doubt about our holding the situation. I am sending copies of this letter to Brenan and Seal.

I returned to Bahrain by air on the 7th June 1938 and after a long interview with Mr. Skliros in the morning, I met His High ness the Shaikh of Bahrain in the afternoon. His Highness was accompanied by Shaikh Mohasxnad bin 'Isa, Shaikh Abdullah bin 9 Isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad f and also by Hr. Belgrave. 3. It was evident that the Shaikhs 9 fear of the Bahrain Petro leum Company's hint (i.e. threat) that partition of the Unallotted Area might cause them to transfer their attention and their major operations to Saudi Arabia had not diminished, and that they were more than ever anxious to relieve their own minds by opening imme diate negotiations with the Bahrain Petroleum Company for the whole Unallotted Area minus the Hawar Islands. His Highness was in parti cularly poor form, unable to appreciate argu ante and patently eager to be relieved of his difficulties.

I handed over copies to His Highness and explained that I now wished to know his preliminary reactions in order to be able to report fully to Hie Majesty* s government and obtain their further advice on his behalf. The Adviser reports that many hours of discussion followed, and in the evening I received a letter from His Highness dated the 9th JUne 1 38, of which a copy is enclosed. 5. As was to be expected the determining factor has been the fear that Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited might, at least for some years to come, reduce production in the Bahrain field to a minimum unless His Highness yielded to their demands. To the minds of the Sheikhs it is out of the question to resist the threat so made, and they confidently believe that His Majesty*a Government will appreciate their position. It is true that the Bahrain Petroleum Company's letter has been carefully worded to exclude any explicit threat, but no doubt ia left that the Company does not recede one iota from the position stated ver bally both to Mr. Belgreve and myself as reported in ray telegram No. 98 dated the 23rd May 1938. It is equally true that the Ghaikh displays some apparent disregard for this th-eat in that he states his wish to allocate Hawar Islands to Petroleum Con cessions Limited. Hers, however, other factors intervene. Pre sumably Kis Highness retains a recollection of the previous attitude/--3- q-i4) attitude of indifference displayed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited towards the Ilawar Islands, and he and his Family feel very definitely that the allocation of Hawar to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited must involve them In unending diffi culties in future. Indeed both Mr. Bel;*rave end I have little doubt, from remarks which His Highness has passed, that he has some confused idea in his mind that the grant of a concession for Hawar to the Bahrain Petroleum Company might result in the loss of his sovereignty over that group of Islands. 6. I am submitting a further report with more detailed com ments to the Political Besident. Meanwhile I need only add that Mr. Belgrave will arrive in London about the 19th June and will call at the India Office In case his knowledge of the local back ground may be of assistance.

In reply to your letter of even date (C/371-10/14) |j whilst my Company is prepared to discuss the division of the Unallotted Area on the basis of the scheme proposed by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, I take it that His Highness is not averse to considering an alternative scheme, copies of which, marked 'The Leased Area Bahrain', I beg to enclose in duplicate, which corresponds roughly with the boundaries outlined on His Highness* scheme, but which provides for a land base essential for the exploration and eventual exploit ation of the Leased Area, if oil is found therein. With reference to His Highness* preliminary views in regard to the ppints enumerated for consideration in due course, I take it that these will be matters for negotiation so soon as His Highness intimates his readiness to negotiate; my own preliminary reaction to these points is that two years may not suffice for the location of submerged structures, and a pos sible or chance production of 500 tons a day could only be regarded as an oilfield on the principle that one swallow must make a summer. I foresee no difficulty over agreeing terms on Articles (11), (13) and (15), nor on (26.b.). In regard to (26.a) His Highness* proposals are confined almost wholly to waters and no operations can be undertaken thereon without a land base somewhere; whilst I do not rule out the possibility of the Hawar Islands furnishing such a base, I am for the present unable to agree that they can, as no Company's representative has been permitted to go there, and I know nothing of their possibilities/-- 2 - W (3) possibilities beyond the fact that they are said to be in capable of supporting a population. My Company is willing to discuss these matters further at His Highness* pleasure, for which purpose I am advising Major F. Holmes to hold himself in readiness for such nego tiations, failing whom Mr, E.V, Packer will represent my Company, I have the honour to be, Sir, Yours faithfully, (SdJ) J. Skliros Managing Director. H. Weightman, Fs,, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain.THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED No* PA - 259 Awali, Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf* 8 June 1038* His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Dear Sir, I have received your letter dated 8 June, 1938, on the subject ’’Bahrain Unallotted Area” together with its attachments^ inviting my Company's views on the scheme proposed by His High ness the Shaikh of Bahrain and an offer inregard to financial tenns. These matters have received consideration by my Company and I have to reply as follows* My Company is shocked to read the proposal which appears to be under consideration, as described in this correspondence* If'after more than 6 years of tremendously hard work on our part, I and hamonious and profitable co-operation between us, His High ness now wishes not only to bring our rival into his Sheikhdom but to offer that rival three quarters of his Shaikhdom, it seems that what we can write on paper during this last hour is of little importance. We believe we have already written it better in the great oil field and refinery operations around his new city Awali, and in the abundant prosperity of his Shaikh dom, and in the happy faces of his people. However, since we are now asked to name the amount of money which we are prepared to pay to c ontinue our development within his Shaikhdom, and the terms which would be acceptable to us, we request that His Highness be advised as follows: My Company is prepared to pay His Highness Rs. 400,000 upon the granting of a concession covering all territory, in cluding waters, under the dominion of His Highness, other than that/-- 2 - that already held by my Company under its present Mining Lease. It is my Company* s intention that its present Mining Lease would be extended to cover the ^Unallotted Area** to which the present offer pertains, except for certain modifi cations applying specifically to the ’’Unallotted Area**. These modifications would embrace the following points, de tails concerning which would be arranged to the satisfaction of both parties; My Company would carry out geological work making use of the most modern scientific methods applicable, including the drilling of structure wells; drill tes£ wells for oilrf wherever geological evidence warranted; continue drilling further wells, if oil should be discovered, until oil in commercial quantities (daily average of 500 tons with good oil field practice) has been obtained or until the area is no longer deemed favourable; and, upon discovery of oil in commercial quantities, continue drilling within the product ive area until the requirements of good oil field practice have been met, this obligation however being subject to sus pension during such time as wells then drilled are capable of a total daily average of at least 1000 tons of oil. My Company would also agree t o substantially increased obligations on its part for additional drilling w' thin the area now covered by its present Mining Lease, including more wells to the present main pay, more wells to the newly dis covered deep zone if commercial production is developed there, and resumption of drilling in our Deep Test to d etermine what possibilities exist at even g reater depths than we have now explored• My Company would also guarantee a minimum royalty of Rs. 50,000 per year from the ’’Unallotted Area** commencing with/-with the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantitiesi and would b e willing to discuss the matter of substantially increasing the minimum royalty now established for the area now covered by its present Mining Lease. My Company wishes now to point out to His Highness its reasons in brief, for objecting to a rival oil company entering this Sheikhdom j Peace and prosperity can be enjoyed only where there is trust and security. We have had all these in Bahrain. They cannot be found in any other country in this entire part of the world. We ask His Highness to look about and say if this is true. We ask His Highness to s ay what part we have had in making it true. To answer this it is better to ±± look at our years of w ork than to read what we might write now in paper. With a strong rival in this Shaikhdom we would not feel safe. Trust and security would be gone. W e do not mean that our rivals are wicked, but only that they are rivals. When we are alone or with our friends in our own house we go about our affairs in security and think only of doing our duties well. But if a rival comes into the house we have only one eye and one hand for our family and friends, and keep one eye and one hand ready to guard ourselves if necessary. His Highness may ask what our rivals might do to bother us. We can only answer that our Company comes from the oldest oil company in the world, andit has leam'ed by much experience that the greatest dangers to any company are the things a rival can do , when both want something which only one can have. During the past two years, while we have been developing mxxkgakKxin markets in many countries, for Bahrain oil, we have found our road blocked in many ways aid have been forced to fight our way step by step. If His Highness/--4- Highness wishes this to b e repeated here in his own Sheikh dom we cannot prevent it, but until it is done we can urge against it* After it has been done all we can do is to look out for ourselves* Tf someone suggested to His Highness that a strong rival Shaikh be invited to move in with his people, the dangers would be recognised immediately. A large Company with a tremendous outlay of money and plans for a long fu ture to protect, will s±e the same thing. A rival outside the house is merely a rival, but when the door is opened for him to come in and step bet./een friends he bedomes a danger, and the smaller the house the greater the danger. His Highness may wish to know what effect the pre sence and possible activities of a rival would have upon our plans. We can say only that, with due regard for our obligations as set down in the concession agreement, ve would v . e&amp; JUV'' { S - V ( C' adopt new plans based upon the changed situation. Under any circumstances, however, His Highness maybe assured that we shall faithfully discharge every obligation put upon us by our concession agreement. More than that v/e cannot say. Because we know that it has been discussed by others, my Company wishes to s ay plainly here that it is a British corporation, paying British taxes, employing largely British subjects, and co-operating most whole-heartedly with His Britannic Majesty 1 * Government in all ways which are posible; and that it Has been assured that its efforts in this di rection have been lecognised and are appreciated. Our capi tal is American. We neither deny it nor cover it up. No third foreign country owns any part of our company. My Company wishes to point out that the d emand for oil to supply its present markets cannot nearly be met from its present production at Bahrain, and that it is forced to buy/--5- (&amp;J v:^ buy very large quantities of products to supply its own cus tomers. Under these circumstances my Company points out that its own aearch fore rude oil cannot be looked upon as a move / merely to iscure a reserve source of supply, to b e used when and if its ordinary source of supply is cut off, for example in the event of war. Also it points out that it has a large and modern refinery, an excellent shipping terminal, an established operating organisation and a welld eveloped living community already available for refining and shipping any additional oil that may be discovered within this Shaikh- dom. My Company suggests that all these circumstances be taken into account when comparing the probability, between two companies, of actively developing a new oil field here. My Company was asked to state its views concerning the proposal presented by His Highness, and to make an offer in regard to financial terms. Both these instructions have been complied with here. In presenting these viev/s we have emphasized the importance to us of avoiding a conflict bet ween two large oil companies within this Shaikhdom. W e wish to point out that the v ery substantial increase in our pre sent cash offer over the one of a year ago represents the price we are willing to pay for the privilege, which it now seams we must buy,of working in peace and harmony instead of in conflict. Division of the area wipes out this value. Trusting that the foregoing statement will give His Highness the information he seeks, I am Yours faithfully, Sd/- J.S. Black, Chief Local Representative, The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited.(5^) Copy of letter No, PA-260 dated the 9th June 1938 from the Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, For the information of those concerned I attach to and as a part of this letter a memorandum, 'Additional Area - Bahrain” dated Awali, Bahrain, 25th May, 1938, in which is set forth certain views held by my Company in respect of the so-called 'Additional” or 'Unallotted” Area in Bahrain.

After others had declined, we took the risks and discovered and developed the first structure. 2. We have backed up that development with a capital outlay of more than £4,000,000 on Bahrain Island alone, for permanent and modern equipment. Now, at relatively much le ss expense, we c ould expand these basic facilities to a ccommodate increased operations, if any become possible, and enjoy an ultimate economy to effect our rather excessive initial outlay. 3. The advantages of our own vork - in demonstrating productivity of certain geological zones, in deve loping drilling methods, in training local labour, in brining new aid world wide shipping lines into Bahrain, in promoting the growth and utility of many auxiliary services such as merchants,transport ation, and contributing to the social and industrial welfare of the people and tolthe assimilation of ideas between two widely different cultures will inevitably be reaped by whomever proceeds from this point wi th generally similar operations. That this should be so inheres in the situation and is not contingent upon who proceeds with the work nor upon the terms of any formal agreement. 4. In addition to our capital outlay on Bahrein Island itself, and to our other development activities there, we have — during the last t wo years — made the name Bahrein known, and favorably, throughout the entire wsrld; and have made a capital outlay of millions of potlnds in distributing and market ing facilities, including large and thoroughly mo dern tankships — one of which b ears the name ’’BAH REIN”. The foundation of this tremendous enterprise was a limited proven production from the first Bah rein structure, and our faith in our ability to sup plement this by further production from yet undis covered f ields as that first production normally else liLn@w* 5. We have been lead to believe, by those competent to make such an ecpression, that we enjoy a preferential right over other applicants in respect of the ’’Addi tional Area”, and that this preferential right was recognised and accepted by t .ose competent to give effect to it 5 and our own conduct of negotiations looking toward extending our present concession has been basad upon this understanding. That this is so has been well known by all those closely concerned w: Lh the matter, and is further evidenced by our com plete acquiescence bo the Bahrein Government*s request of about one year ago that we db not press our applica tion until again invited to do so — even though it has been/-3 /- - 2 - (^Bo) been well known to us that c ompetitive interests have not shown the same consideration. To learn now that in the final hearing we should b e denied the weight we al ready have gained, andte placed in an even balance against a newcomer, would indeed be a rude shock. 2.0. Bahrein Government has no apparent r e as on for displeasure! 1. Our Company^ ability to f ind and produce oil speaks for itself. 2. Our Company far exceeded its contractual obligations for drilling, even during a period when most large companies were pursuing conservative policies owing to world-wide economic disturbances, and before ary plans had even been formulated for providing normal outlets through our own refining and marketing facilities. 3. Our refinery, as to processes and equipment installed up to now, is probably the most up-to-date oil refinery in the world. In the face of many obstacles - such as industrial, and marine strides at home, severe climate, isolated location and untrained labor, this refinery was designed, erected and put^into operation - again with untrained labor - in a Ktaii so short that even now it is scarcely believed by those unacquainted with the ac tual facts. We doubt if anything even approaching this can be found in the entire history of rival applicants for further developments here. 4. We have observed meticulously every wish of Shaikh Hamad and of the local Government, whether contractual or sub sequently expressed or implied by them, in respect of re ligious or social customs of the local people. 5. We have co-operated, we believe effectively, with local policies and programmes relating to training the local people for our work. While this is itself a long-time progress we believe that those concerned are fully ac quainted and satisfied with our plans and our peogress. v'e have used and shall continue using loc al workers in preferance to all others to the greatest actent currently possible, despite the inconvenience to us, in many cases, of so doing. 6 . We have fl?om the outset promoted the policy of having local merchants stoclj: and sell the kinds of merchandise of all d e script ions that are ordinarily demanded by our people, and as rapidly as satisfactory sources have been established we have discontinued our own imports to avoid what might be looked upon as damaging competition. 7. Aside from such evidence ascn be listed categorically, the warm personal friendships which have developedbetween so many members of our organisation and Shaikh Hamad and various members of the Ruling Family, Government Officials and others resident on Bahrein, suggests - if we may say so - that neither our presence nor our activities here have proved objectionable.o&gt; 4 /- -3- 3. 0. Government has no apparent reason for displeasure with us* 1. As we have co-operated with the B a hrain Baler and the Government! so have we with H.B.M* Government, This co operation has extended to the Agency! the Residency! H.B.M, governmental offices in India and to the India Office and all other of H.B.M, servants with whom we have had occasion to deal. 2. In defenerence to requests from H.B.M. officials this Company has refrained from pressing negotiations with several not dista t provinces, even though invited by their local rulers to negotiate. We have watched rival commercial interests enter these provinces and have as sisted them with gsological information, mechanical s er- vice and supplies. It must be recognised that when we refrained from these neogitations we were in fargreater need of c rude supplies than were bur rivals, and from commercial considerations alone had arery reason to con- aider ourselves entitled to equal opportunity. 3. Our activities as well as our interests in connection with oil concessions are purely cbmrnercial and not at all political. We have been assiduous, and successful, in avoiding participation in any political situation, ac cept for such c o-operation with H.B.M. Government as is mentioned in the preceding paragraph. By our respect for a and co-operation with H.B.M. Government we believe we have enhanced its prestige among the non-British residents of this region, and certainly we have taken no steps to en hance our own at its expense. Hor have we resorted to bribes, propaganda or chicanery in any form to induce any persons to act in our interests or to subvert those of H.B.M. or of our commeridal rivals. 4. We have spared no effort to learn for ourselves, and through invited counsel, the ways in which we might adapt and utilize our facilities for the convenience of H.B.M. defence services. 5. Despite the specialised nature of our work and the ha zards of unskilled operation, e have pursued, and shall continue to pursue, a program of employment and training of British subjects to ake over all positions in the or ganisation as rapidly as c ompetent men can he found or trained. From many years experience in selecting and training men at home, under much more favorable circums tances, we know that this problem is most difficult. We know, too, that anyone acquainted with such problems will find our plans and our accomplishment commendable, and will agree that uninformed insistence on haste for haste’s sake may have most serious consequences. 6 . We do not believe that any ground exists for retaliatory measures a gainst our interests, because of discrimination against British oil companies in our own country, as in fact such comoanies operate on equality wi th our own, as is well known.-4- 4. 0. We are better prepared than any others to continue deve lopment in Bahrein* 1. As a result of more than 6 years of continuous geological investigation and d evelopment of production in this loca lity, ve have a knowledge of subsurface conditions, dril ling methods and measures necessary for safeguarding the oil reserves, which caanot even be approached by any others At this time, and not at any time until similar experience here has b een had by them over a long period. While we have assisted others by supplying infomation along these lines, such willingness on our part cannot be aken as the equivalent of years of actual w&amp;Pk trial and er or on their ov/n part. 2. We have already 6 n the ground as a g&gt;ing concern a com plete organisation of men and equipment, readily avail able h only minor supplementing to undertake gsologi- cal, geophysical, production, refining, shipping, and general administrative w ork essential to the testing and full d evelopment of the region. No other concern has, or can possibly have, an organisation to compare with this one until it has been developed here as this one has. 3. The most trying and hazardous stage in the d evelopment oi a new undertaking such as ours here, occurs during its first few years while it is learning and adjusting itself to 1 the social, political, religious and commer cial. economies of a particular v3heikhdom$ and the wishes, policies and even fancies of a particular Sheikh and his people. These things, while of the utmost importance, are only vaguely indica ed in the b eginning and are lear ned only through experience within the Sheikhdom. Most important of all is the development of mutual confidence, which - between peoples of widely differing racial, cul tural and religious backgrounds Rs is at best a fragile thing. Adjustments have been necessary on both sides. Misunderstandings have developed and been cleared away. Untruths have been whispered, and brought into the light. Wef? admit ■freely that Sheikh Hamad has earned and won our confidence and respect, and we believe - and shall not readily change our view - that we have his. Certainly no other applicant can put forward more than rhetorical evidence in prediction of a similar harmony, and scarcely even this without at the same t ime pointing out the ha zards of introducing an entirely new system of policies, practices and relationships into a Sheikhdom which has, with patience and difficulty, hardly yet completely assi milated the first. 0. The Additional Area should not be divided. 1. While the speculations of laymen regarding the presence or absence of oil in an untested area is valueless, the experienced judgment of specialists based upon expert examination and xorrelation with adjacent formations, thoroughly known to them, must be recognised as, at 1 ast, the best guide we Ran have short of astually drilling. Based upon such exp rienced judgment our Opinion is tha% the Adcitional Area holds little promise of development into a valuable oil producing region. To us, however, who have already spent vast sums of money, years of time, and endless effort on thepart of a great organisation both at home and here, toward the development of a peiv manent institution of which the physical, the commercial and/--5- and the hiaman dimensions have been equally problems and are equally vital to its continued success, the fringe of this Sheikhdom possesses a value which it cannot on any legitimate ground have for any other com- merxial interest, Y/e do not deny, in fact we assert, that another such interest interposing its influence between the Sheikh and ourselves might easily bring our present harmonious relationship to a state per mitting the third party to dominate through ecercise of a balancing power. We think we mi^ht almost say that, taking all circumstances into account, we see no other season why such a third interest would seek a foothold in this Sheikhdom. Certainly it is the chief reason for us objecting to one coming in. From this point of view the extent of such a third party holding is of no consequence, . 2 , “■ o whatever extent it may be argued that a rival appli cant is interested in oil productions alone, we point out that a survey of the present holdings of our rival interests in the countries bordering the Persian Gulf, both developed and undeveloped, leaves little ground for giving the argument weight, or for supposing that a program of development in an a rea promising relatively so little, wouldbe prosecuted beyond thesbsolute mini mum fo ced upon them by contract, 3, While possibly only of indirect concern to us, we call attention to the unquestionable fact that the dsvelop- ment of an oil concession^, particularly in this part of the world, imposes very real burden upon the Ruler and his Government, and would, in this instance, neces sitate not merely a repetition of assimilatin i a new institution into the Sheikhdom, but doing it under conditions charged with the conflict of e xternal in terests. 4, Y’he stakes involvedin this issue between our rivals ami oursetves are entirely unequal. After many years of supposedly successful and widely publicised operations in this small and hitherto little-known Sheikhdom, if we w ere now forced to share £sh its development with another oil company the event would not pass unnoticed anywhere in the oil-interested world. To believe that this is of minor importance to us is to disregard entirely its significance. This stake xannot be matched by our rivals. To have a commercial rival in a position to come between us and the Sheikh of Bahrein, arousing con troversies, breeding doubts and setting up a system of policies differentfl?om o r own - however appropriate they might be under other circi,instances - would be most damaging to us. Here again they have nothing to lose and, we submit, nothing constructive or even properly legitimate to gain. V T e have made Bahrein our operatig headquarters on this side of the world and would like to feel that conditions were favorable to h: it remaining so. This will never andean never be so for any others# 5, To bring a rival concessionaire into this mall Sheikhdta inevitably would invite a partition of in erests anong those closest to its people and its sovereign psx affairs. There/-w There is some ground for believing that, already, | the prospect of having another source of private gain has brought a gleam into the eyes of some who : jj v ' feel they have services to offer. While we are aware of the g re at good that has come to this domain through the wise administration of oil revenues we believe too, and sincerely, that there is a price too dear to give in e xchange for the advantages - whatever they a re c onsidered to b e - of rifting the Additional Area and with it the peace and har mony under which our own concession has brought prosperity to us all* 0 O 0P - ; V ' f ■ . ^ L;l 4 ^ Jtf' I HI $ A^“' Lm«J 1 jjjfr I^iihiii Aj 1 Li* i ** i Jl A LmV 'j&amp; I ■r J- * jj XjuJt i Sjjk Ji-^I i.1—I — ..

This point was not clear from the short summary which we had previously received. In the case of the Bahrein Petroleum Company's offer, however, increased payments are related to the discovery of oil in J. P. Gibson, Esq., ‘ India Office, r ?: '»• , s - w * !♦ , INDIA OFFICE'commercial quantity',and my objection to this still holds good. There are no further points of special importance which I wish to comment on in connection with the Draft Concession. I am sending copies of this letter to Brenan and Seal.

Nor have we any objection in principle to the Sheikh’s proposal to give the Petroleum Concessions Ltd., their surface rights in Maharaq. Island, though the actual allocation of the surface rights area will need detailed consideration, in the light, for instance, of R.A.P. requirements. We in the views of the Petroleum Department as set out in Starling’s letter to you of the 27th May with regard to the Sheikh’s proposed stipulation prohibiting the conveyance of oil to Qatar. While we, ourselves, for reasons of defence, would rather like to see the second Refinery located in Bahrein, we entirely agree with Starling that a restriction of this character on the movement of oil is undesirable in principle and might well, if the custom were followed by other trucial Sheikhs, prejudice the selection of the most suitable site for the refinery to be erected by Petroleum Concessions Ltd., if and when their production reacnes the figure laid down. We do not, however, consider it very lively that Qatar ^ on account of the nature of £&amp;£# coast will^ ever prove a suitable location for a refinery, and we would suggest, therefore, that if the Sheik of Bahrein should prove obdurate over his proposed stipulation, it might J. P.G-ibson Esq., 14 JUN i9db i be India Office, S.VV.l. INDIA OFFICE I ■ ii ■. jwii —• »■ ••••••#be possible to satisfy him with a private assurance from the Company that they consider it unlikely that they will ever want to convey oil to Qatar for refining. We also share Starling^ view that we should mmi try to persuade the Bahrein Petroleum Company to agree to a pre-emption clause in connection with the new concession now proposed. Similarly we assume that provision for pre-emption Asti- would be made in with Petroleum Concessions Ltd., if they obtain any portion of the unallotted area. We agree with the suggestion in paragraph 3 of your letter that if the arbitration clauses in the proposed concessions are invoissable in disputes between the two Companies, there will be no need for a special clause to cover this point. The remainder of the Sheikh’s proposed terms are quite acceptable from the Admiralty point of view, though we feel some doubt whether the Companies will be persuaded to accept them all. With regard to paragraph 4 of your letter, the Admiralty could not agree that any foreign claim to the Hawai' do c*Sl~ ja^v-t Sjui group of islands could be admitted, and^that there is Oe^need to safeguard our position, except in respect of a possible dispute between Qatar and Bahrein. Subject to this we see no objection to the formula suggested by Beckett for dealing in the lease with this group (Brenan’s letter to you No*E.2288/413/91 of the 25th April), or to the Conveyance of a ^^^i^g to the bheikh that the claims of other rulers may have to be considered. I am sending copies of this letter to Starling and Brenan. Yours sincerely,M. 03329/38. SECRET.

The situation now is that the advice which we suggested should be given to the Sheikh, namely that he should, as a first step, put his original proposals as to a method of geographical division in writing to each Company through the Political Agent, has not in fact been given. Before the Political Agent arrived back in Bahrein, Mr. Skliros approached the Sheikh direct. He was received by the Sheikh, together with members of his family and the Adviser, and the Sheikh told him that he would consider an offer for the Hawar Group only and emphatically refused to consider any other area. What is curious is that the Assistant Political Agent '5 reports that Skliros has submitt#* an offer for the Sheikh’s consideration at once and that he is satisfied. He also informed the Sheikh that he had authority to conclude negotiations himself. For the moment the Resident has instructed the Assistant Political Agent to remind the Sheikh and Skliros that2 i. ) O &lt; 4 .^ fc ^ Jt ^~-^ a any agreement arrived at is subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, and he has asked the Political Agent on his return (which is to-day) to see the Sheikh and Skliros and telegraph a report on the situation to us. It seems to me that no good purpose will be served by our taking any action here until we get this report from the Political Agent after he has seen the Sheikh and Skliros, I do not think that we -ee&gt;ql&amp; now press for the delivery of our proposed a. advice to the Sheikh since he has, in ftte—informal audience with Skliros^ definitely expressed an entirely different idea of what he is prepared to do. Moreover on our present information we are told that Skliros is satisfied with what he has got. Although this seems very unlikely I think that we can leave it to the Company to approach us again if they are not satisfied when they hear from Skliros, as presumably they are bound to do. On the subject of Heines, you will see that the Assistant Political Agent expresses the opinion that,in view of what ha&lt;f happened, the presence of Holmes now appears unnecessary. If the Company does regard Skliros* account of the situation as satisfactory it is probable that Holmes* services will not be required but I should think it is more likely that there will, in any case, be a good deal of hard bargaining to be done before the matter is settled and that the Company will want to stick to their idea of employing Holmes at Bahrein. In Sir T. Powle*s telegram of the 4th June, No.224, he suggests that we should explain to Lord Cadraan, in any manner we consider suitable, that his Company have not in fact been handicapped by the absence of Holmes. He suggests that Holmes (a) could not have got more out of the Sheikh them his original idea of dividing up the area and (b) could not have prevented the last minute threats by Bapco that have brought about the present situation. Lord Cadman would no doubt admit (a) but I very much doubt whether he would admit (b). He would argue, and in fact did so argue when he spoke to me on the telephone, that it was just thefact that Holmes was not there that has allowed Thornherg the opportunity of queering the pitch. I do not think we should do anything about this for the moment till we see how things develop. If Lord Cadman expresses a desire to come and see Sir Pindlater Stewart or the Secretary of State, we can make a note of this point as a matter to be dealt with at the interview.Minute Paper.

POL - 7 JUN 1938 IMDIA office$ \ b-S.S. ktflt ULpj^ ji u sCsvJ A- t JM) Is U At- A*lxA+.tlS 4 a ; ^ I saw Mr. Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. this morning. I told him that B.P.C. have made representati-&gt;ns locally against division of the area; they are much more anxious than they were last year to obtain the whole of the unallotted area and are consequently prepared to make a very much larger offer for it. I said that we felt that it was only fair to P.C.L. to acquaint them at once of this new development, in accordance with our undertaking to Lord Cadman. Mr. Longrigg expressed his thanks for the information, which he will at once pass 1 ,on to Lord Cadman. Subsequently Lord Cadman himself telephoned to rne and expressed himself as v. ry disturbed at the information which had been passed on to him by Mr. Longrigg. He referred to the fact that when he had rung up this Office on the 9th May, he had been given to understand that there was no need to worry hiAc or to talffr of any action as our information was that K P.C.L. would get what they wanted. He had apparently ^ taken this as a definite guarantee from us that the Mo /* V*-f MS* ^matter would 'be settled in favour of P.G.L. I explained to him that it was never intended to give any such definite guarantee, hut that the information given to him on the 9th May was correct in the light of the information which we had then. Unfortunately the latest developments, of v/hich we have only just heard, had thrown the whole matter in the melting-pot again. Lord Cadman then said that the new situation was very unsatisfactory from his point of view because, whereas the American Qovornjwnvb had for monthsheen 'manuring the ground' as he put it, P.C.L. had, at our request, removed their negotiator, Major Holmes, and were thus heavily handicapped. He said that he would immediately telegraph out to Mr. Skliros the information which we had given to him but he stated that he might feel it necessary, if Mr. Skliros* subsequent report to him on the situation were not satisfactory, to ask to see someone at the India Office and discuss the matter. I promised him that I would make a note of what he had said and pass it on. Later in the day Mr. Lefroy, w»io-ha□ oi3. telephoned and said that he was ringing up^at Lord . k Cadman f s request, inf or mack us that it was desired K by the Company to make use of Major Holmes’ services as their negotiator if he could be got hold of, and to ask us, in the light of the new situation, to withdraw our objections to him. I told Mr. Lefroy that I would immediately take the question up but that we could not give an answer on this point without consulting the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Lefroy said that he quite understood that. The whole business is rather unfortunate, and I feel that there is considerable substance in Lord Cadman’s complaint that his Company has been considerably handicapped in these negotiations by the absence of any negotiator at Bahrein, which resulted from Sir T. Powle 1 s objection to Major Holmes. As regards Lord Cadman's telephone call on 9th May, a note of which is flagged at A on the file below, we could only answer him then in the light of the information then in our possession, and we hadd 4 just heard from Sir T. Fowle that the Sheikh of Bahrein was proposing to divide the other allotted area in a manner which would give P.C.L. substantially what they wanted. In the light of the new situation I feel that it will be very difficult to maintain our objection to the use by the Company of Major Holmes* services as a negotiator, and I put up a draft telegram to the Resident, giving a very strong lead in favour of meeting Lcrd Cadman's request on this point.Sy Draft Paper.

Action on the lines approved at P.Z.3740/38 (flagged/ i.e. approval in principle of the Sheikh of Bahrein’s proposal for the division of the Bahrein Unallotted Area - was suspended in view of the telegram of 26th May (P.Z.3703/38) from the Political Resident, in which it was stated that there had 'been further developments which were Being reported By air mail from Bahrein. The express letter at P.Z.3837/38 from the Political Agent, Bahrein, explains what the developments are. Briefly, what has happened is that Mr. ThomBerg (the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s local representative) having no douBt heard of the proposal to divide the area, indicated orally to Mr. Belgrave (the Sheikh of Bahrein’s Adviser) that if a second Oil Company obtained a concession in Bahrein his own Company might Be compelled to concentrate on their Saudi properties, to the detriment of Bahrein production. Mr. Weightman (the Political Agent) then saw Mr.ThomBerg^ . who repeated this statement and added that in order to keep out another Company his own Company would proBaBly increase last year’s offer severalfold, even if they were not allowed to develop the additional area. In view of the nature of his conversation with Mr. ThornBerg, the Sheikh’s Adviser thought it necessary to inform the Sheikh, with the result that the Sheikh instructed Mr. Belgrave to inform the Political Agent that he had ordered Mr. Belgrave to ascertain from the Bahrein Petroleum Company what offer they would make for the whole area minus Hawar, and similarly from Petroleum/Petroleum Concessions Limited what they would offer for the Hawar Group only. Mr. Weightraan, however, sent a message to the Sheikh via Mr. Belgrave, asking him to postpone any decision or communication to the Companies pending receipt of advice from His Majesty’s Government, and he now asks for instructions from here as soon as possible. In order to clear the air and to obtain more time to consider the matter it is suggested that the best course would be to authorise the Political Agent to advise the Sheikh # of Bahrein to inform both Companies that he divide the area on the riginally suggested and, without going into terms, to ask for their views in v/riting. It is true that this will probably lead to an 'auction*', which the » Sheikh was anxious to avoid, but it will at least bring the Americans into the open and will give Petroleum Concessions Limited a chance to make their own position clear. So far the Americans, being on the spot, have had ♦ .■ Jr • things all their own way. On our advice Petroleum Concessions Limited refrained from taking any action v/hatever until the Sheikh had intimated that he was prepared to resume negotiations. It is understood, however, that Mr. Skliros (the Managing Director of ♦ Petroleum Concessions Limited) is thinking of flying to Bahrein to-morrow, and in fairness to his Company it seems desirable, particularly as the Political Agent is at present doing a tour of the Trucial Coast, that he should be av/are of the recent developments, in this connection it is relevant that Lord Cadman particularly asked/Minute Paper.

Briefly what has happened is that Thornherg, Bapco’s representative, having no doubt heard of the proposal to divide the area, indicated to Belgrave that if a second oil company obtained a concession in Bahrein his own company might be compelled to concentrate on their Saudi properties to the detriment of Bahrein production. Weightman then saw him and he repeated this statement and added that in order to keep out another company his company would probably increase last year’s offer severalfold, even if they were not allowed to develop the additional area. In view of the nature of his conversation with Thornberg, Belgrave thought it necessary to inform the Sheikh and also Sheikhs Abdulla and Salman with the result that the Sheikh instructed Belgrave to inform the Political Agent that he had ordered Belgrave to ascertain from Bapco what offer they would make for the whole area minus Hawar/2 Hawar, and similarly from P.C.L. what they would offer for the Hawar group only. Weightman, however, sent a message to the Sheikh via Belgrave asking him to postpone any decision or communication to the Companies pending the receipt of advice from H.M.G. and he asks for instructions from here as soon as possible. Fowle’s view of Thornberg’s threats is that they are an unpleasant mixture of bluff and blackmail, and as regards the threat of increasing Saudi and reducing Bahrein production to the minimum^he points out that the Company are entirely in the hands of Ibn Saud who will naturally force them to produce to the uttermost, irrespective of their production policy in Bahrein. A further minor complication is reported in the separate express letter of the 20th May from the Political Agent, Bahrein, which shows that the Sheikh of Q,atar has raised a claim to Hawar. The Sheikh is being told to put in a full and complete statement of the evidence on which he relies in asserting Qatar’s sovereignty over the Hawar group of/FILE COPY GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

I also forward a copy of a telegram No. 99 which I have sent to him today. 3. I should explain that my discussion with Mr. Thomberg was initiated by me during a visit on other business since the statement he had made to Mr. Belgrave on the previous day re quired elucidation. 4. It may perhaps be useful to add the following information bearing on the subject, which I have heard in the last three days. (Sigmmmr (i)/- S. 44? : ' MFP—825S&amp;P—(M-1070)—14-9-34—10,000. ^ -TT^oTt pTTT — J- 2 ~ ^HS) (i) The Company’s operations in Saudi Arabia are being greatly accelerated in the expectation (as I heard it ex pressed) that ”Arabia would go over big”. (ii) The base of operations in the northern part of Hassa will be Dhalafain close to Jubail* (iii) Movements of transport between the Company’s base at Dammam and Dhalafain are extremely active. (iv) Though arrangements are already in train for a (com paratively) small quantity of Dammam oil to b e transported to Bahrain in the near future for refining, a survey has al ready been completed for the possible installation of a pipe line between Dammam and Dhalafain. It may be deduced from this that though the Company would probably prefer to pipe their Dammam oil over the short distance to Bahrain for refining, they recognise that Ibn Saud may compel them to refine all ’’Saudi Oil” in Saudi Arabia. Equally it may be deduced that the suggestion of great expan sion of refinery activities in Bahrain (vide paragraph 2(i) of my telegram of the 23rd May) indicated more a pious hope than a definite policy. (v) Drilling to the deeper horizon in Bahrain is not yet such a success as was anticipated. One well (No. 52) has been closed in after striking a very small quantity of oil, ani will probably be utilised in future for test drilling to still deep er horizons. A second well (No. 51) was stopped in a high pressure gas zone, and the gas is being used to exclude en croaching water in the present producing or shallow horizon. The third well (No. 58), the main experimental well at present, is showing a good deal of water after passing through the high pressure gas zone. (vi) The latest figure quoted to me for the Company’s capital outlay in Bahrain up-to-date is 25 million dollars Political Agent, Bahrain.From To No. Dated second oil company obtained a concession in Bahrain his own Company might be compelled to concentrate on their Saudi properties to t he detriment of Bahrain production. 2. I saw him today. He told me he had had communication from London informing him that disposal of Unallotted Area was a purely commercial affair in which political considera tions had no weight and in which His Majesty’s Government would not interfere, (cf. correspondence resting with India Office Printed letters Nos. P.Z.3234 dated the 14th May and the 17th May). This being so his Company would treat it as such and following were main considerations: (1) The Bahrain Petroleum Company, i.e. Caltex, had con templated considerable expansion of activities in Bahrain, involving the expenditure of millions of dollars, on produc tion and refinery of oil from deep horizon here now practi cally certain, plus refinery in Bahrain of crude oil from Saudi Arabia. He hinted that his Company would regard advent of second oil company in Bahrain territories as so damaging to their interests that it might cause complete revision of this programme, slowing down of Bahrain production and con centration on ascertained and expected resources in Saudi Arabia, (cf. paragraph 49 of my Intelligence Summary No. 8 of 1938). (2) His Company have good reason to believe that Petro leum Concessions Limited’s main object in applying for 23rd May 1938. Bahrain Unallotted Area. Yesterday Thornberg indicated to Belgrave that if part/-- 2 - (4TZ part or mfliole of Unallotted Area was to create nuisance value and not to develop oil. They knew that Anglo-Iranian Oil Com pany could vastly increase output at Abadan by merely opening valves and they deduced that Petroleum Concessions Limited* s bid for Bahrain was therefore mainly for above purpose or al ternatively for possible reserve. In either event the Shaikh of Bahrain could not e xpect active production by them beyond minimum required under terms of concession. (3) To his own Company the Unallotted Area was worth immense ly more than it was last year (a) for keeping out competitor companies seeking for nuisance value and (b) for potential deve lopment at Damman and now almost certain in B a hrain, and possib ly between Bahrain and structurally hopeful Qatar. Even though his Company had markets in the East for greatly increased oil shipments from Persian Gulf (b ) was of less inmediate importance than (a) and his Company would pro bably increase last year’s offer several fold even if they were not allowed to develop Additional Area. 3. In these circumstances and if this were purely a commer cial affair between the Shaikh and the Companies he thought that the Shaikh should at least know what he stood to g ain or lose. I was unable to induce him to ddfine^exactly how Petroleum Concessions Limited would create nuisance value even after a fairly definite hint regarding proposed allotment of Manamah Island. 4. I have insufficient knowledge of world-wide actions and reactions between major oil companies to be able to judge how seriously Caltex might view the advent of Petroleum Concessions Limited to Bahrain, or how genuine the scarcely-veiled threat to transfer major activities from Bahrain to Arabia may be. But Thornberg showed me a sketch map indicating location elected for Refinery/--3- Refinery near Jubail north of Has Tanura on main land and indicated that this was where development would come in con junction with field explored near Abu Hadriyah if his Company w lost confidence in Bahrain”♦ 5* In these circumstances I request instructions what com munication, if any, should be made to the Shaikh of Bahrain. The whole thing maybe a bluff, for it is difficult to b elieve that Caltex would fail to utilise fully and immediately for revenue purposes their field and refinery assets in B a hrain. On the other hand the stakes are so immense that it may be best t o infora the Shaikh of the gist of this conversation and leave him to decide whether to stick to his present pro posal or to pen an auction for the whole Unallotted Area. - Political -... _ From Political Resident, 3uahire To Political Agent, Bahrain.

Skliros My dear Symon, In pursuance of our telephone conversation this morning, I send you a copy of the Bahrain Leased Area (1957) Draft Agreement, which represents the Company f s offer as at the end of April, 1957• This was communicated to Mr. Belgrave by Major Holmes. For your convenience I have noted on a separate slip the points of difference between this 1957 Draft and the corresponding 1956 Draft. After the presentation of the 1957 Draft there was further talk between Messrs. Belgrave and Holmes regarding Article 9(^-) (the last two lines), and it is believed that Major Holmes indicated that the Company would be prepared to accept a somewhat lower figure than 2,000. After sending you this, we still retain one copy of the 1957 Draft, so I need not press you for the immediate return of your copy, if such is at all in convenient. J. B. A. Kessler (Dutch) L. M.

May, 1938, Dear GiDson, In reply to your letter of 19th May, No. P.Z.3392/38, enclosing copies of correspondence from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in regard to the Bahrein Unallotted Area, with the exceptions referred to 'below we agree in principle to the proposals now put forward on 'behalf of the Sheikh to grant oil concessions to the Bahrein Petroleum Company and to Petroleum Concessions Limited and, as I have already told you in my interim reply of 25th May, we see no objection to the proposed division of the available area. Before considering the suggestions in detail there is one point in connection with any proposed operations in the unallotted area, and the obligations to be imposed on the two applicants, which I think should be emphasized, viz. the relative positions of the already well-established Bahrein Petroleum Company and of Petroleum Concessions Limited who J. P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, King Charles Street, S.W. 1.to all intents and purposes are new-comers to the area. The Bahrein Petroleum Company have the great advantage that they have already a large proved oilfield in course of development on Bahrein Island with a complete organisation, materials, equipment and a refinery readily available and are therefore in a much better position to undertake any exploratory work and proceed to commercial production without delay than are P.C.L. The latter Company have got to establish a base for operations, import all their equipment and then carry out such preliminary work as may be necessary in order to locate the sites for test boreholes, many of them probably in a marine area. For this reason and also in view of the climatic conditions I do not think it is reasonable to require P.C.L. to commence drilling within two years instead of 6 ^ years which the Company proposed, and I cannot, therefore, altogether agree with the views expressed in paragraph 7 of Fowle f s letter of 7th May, 1938. In ray opinion it would be more reasonable to fix the period within which drilling must be started at t 4 years. With regard to the first paragraph on page 2 of your letter of 19th May, I do not like the condition suggested b&gt;y the Sheikh that 'no oil found within the area to beleased to Petroleum Concessions Limited may 'be conveyed by ship, pipeline or any other method into the Qatar Peninsula'. While it can readily be understood that the Sheikh is anxious to secure that the oil obtained in Bahrein territory is refined there, it is evident that for commercial reasons any refinery which P.C.L. may decide to put up in the Persian Gulf area must be situated in the territory where the bulk of any oil which may be found occurs. If it turned out that only a small production was obtained from the Bahrein marine area, while considerable quantities were found in Qatar, it would be unreasonable to prohibit them from taking the Bahrein oil to Qatar for refining. Moreover, the General Refinery Agreement of 5th February, 1937, provides that if and when a total production of 500,000 tons per annum is achieved the Company agree to consult with H.M. Government as to the best location for the refinery 1 or refineries. If the Sheikh of Bahrein insists on a stipulation that no oil must be conveyed to Qatar it may, to a certain extent, tie the hands of H.M. Government when the location of a refinery under that Agreement comes to scussed. It would also, I fear, constitute a bad 3ent if any particular Sheikh were allowed to make ita condition of the grant of an oil concession that oil should not he conveyed to the territory of a neighbouring Sheikhdom for refining. Furthermore, Petroleum Concessions Limited may well object to such a condition on the grounds that if oil were to be found on or near the Hawar Islands, which are virtually an extension of the mainland of Qatar, it would be uneconomic to convey it to Muharraq. One further point is that the Qatar Political Agreement contains a provision that the Company declare it their intention, should they consider that commercial conditions justify it, to erect a refinery in Qatar. The Company agreed, if and when they were satisfied that commercial production was assured, to examine with H.M. Government the question of establishing a refinery in Qatar of suitable type and capacity. Although this only amounts to a declaration of good intentions on behalf of the Company, it will be recalled that it was not found possible when the negotiations were proceeding to make the obligations any more binding. Whatever may be the views of the Service Departments on this question, it would, I suggest, bepreferable from every point of view if the Sheikh of Bahrein could he persuaded to confine himself to affording all facilities for the erection of storage tanks and refineries, hut to refrain from laying down any stipulations as to the destination of any oil produced. It will also he necessary to consider the question of pre-emption in the case of the Unallotted Area. No provision was made for pre-emption in the original Bahrein concession for reasons peculiar to that concession (see record of a meeting at the India Office on 27th September, 1933), hut the point might now he taken up with the Bahrein Petroleum Company in connection with the new concession which it is now proposed to grant them. As regards P.C.L. it is presumed that they will he asked to enter into a Political Agreement on similar lines to those which they have accepted elsewhere. With regard to the other provisions of the draft concessions, it is stated in Belgrave’s letter of 7th May, 1938, that the new concession to the P.C.L. will he in the form of the 1937 draft lease for Bahrein, which was handed to the Bahrein Government a year ago, with the addition of certain clauses and changes which are shown in the schedule. We have no copy of this draft lease of- 6 - (Sjg) ^ 1937 and I note from your further letter of 25th May that spare copies are not at present available. The points I am raising in this letter are therefore subject to any further points which may arise when I have an opportunity of seeing the draft concession in full. It is difficult to express any useful opinion on the subject of the proposed minimum payments, particularly as so much of the territory involved is under the sea, but on the whole the financial terms do not seem unreasonable, and I think they must be left for final settlement between the Sheikh and the Companies concerned as in the case of the other commercial ^agreements which have been entered into in the Persian Gulf. I notice, however, that in the schedules attached to Belgrave’s letter reference is made to a 'definition” of the discovery of 'oil in commercial quantity' upon which apparently certain of the payments depend. It will be recalled that when the Bahrein Petroleum Company t s lease was under revision we pointed out the difficulties which might arise from the inclusion of such a provision, and the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s lease was eventually amended so as to delete all reference to the discovery of oil in commercial quantity, and to provide, in order to safeguard the Sheikh’s position, for the payment of an increasedannual payment after a specified time, (in this connection see my letter to Laithwaite of 15th February, 1934.) Although some of the Persian Gulf commercial agreements have contained references to the production of oil ’’in commercial quantity” I think we have a good case here for eliminating this unsatisfactory provision and following the practice adopted in the case of the lease already granted to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The royalty proposals are in accordance with the usual scale which prevails in the Persian Gulf. I agree that it is desirable that some provision should be made to provide for arbitration in the event of any dispute arising between the two companies and that, as you suggest, the point referred to in paragraph 5 of the Political Resident’s letter might suitably be met by an appropriate amendment to the arbitration clauses in the proposed commercial concessions. As these concessions may be largely concerned with drilling in submarine areas it is desirable that they should contain a general clause to guard against pollution of sea water and fisheries from contamination by the escape of oil. A clause designed with this object in viewwas prepared for use in Uganda when a concession was granted over part of Lake Albert ana a copy of this clause is attached for convenience of reference. I am sending copies of this letter to Brenan and Seal. Yours sincerely,P.D.492 Pt.I Extract from letter of 20.12.37 to Colonial Office. Draft Clause for inclusion in Uganda Concession. 'Pollution.

The Islets Ghassar Noon, A1 Hool and Ghassar Rock, to v/hich reference is made in the boundary descriptions, are located close to the southern extremity of Bahrain Lain Island, but as they lie in an area which has not yet been covered by an Admiralty Survey it is not possible to s 4- te their exact position by longitude and latitude.

It should be noted that the plans already forv/arded were prepared by the Bahrain Land Department from two Admiral ty charts of different scale, that much of the southern part of the two areas has never been accurately surveyeds. nd that the plans therefore are not more than moderately accurate. At one or two points the Land Department has indicated the existence of islands or reefs where the Admiralty charts show only variations in depth of water* Political Agent, Bahrain.(3)/- DESCRIPTION OF TEE BOUNDARIES OF THE AREA / 7??\ TO BE OFFERED TO PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED • 0 O 0 From point A on the south-western extremity of one of the twin islets of BAINAIN (included in the area), the approximate position of which is BG^S’N, SO^O’E, in a straight line running in a north-easterly direction to point 3, the position of which is 26°21.3 , N, 50°42.2 , E; thence in a straight line in a southerly direction to point C, on the islet of GHASSAR NOON (which is not inclu ded in the area); thence in a straight line running in a south-easterly direction to point D on the southern extremity of JSNAN island in the Hawar Group of Islands: thence in a line touching the southern extremities of Hawar Main Island, and of the most southerly islets in the Hawar Group (points E, E-p E^ etcetera) to the most south easterly island (point F) in this group (all of which are included in the area); thence in a straight line running in a northerly direc tion to point G, the position of v/hich is 26 o 23.5 , N,51°04.0 , E; thence in a straight line in a west-north-westerly direction to point H, the position of which is 26°34.2 , N, 50°29.4 f E; thence in a straight line running in a west-south westerly direction to point I, the position of which is 26°32.4'N, 50°24.2'~ thence in a straight line to the starting point A NOTES (1) The position of the starting point has been taken from a small scale chart and is therefore stated only approximately. ( 2 ) The directions stated between the various points are rough guides only and not intended to denote magnetic bear ings.(3) The position taken for point B is the present posi tion of a red flashing buoy roughly north-east of Muharraq Island. The latitude and longitude given are accurate, but it should be noted that this buoy is liable to drag and the buoy itself therefore must not be used for fbture survey. The reef or shaal shown on the plan at the point B does not in fact exist. (4) Point C (Ghassar Noon) is roughly east of the southern point of the Bahrain Main Island and very slightly off the red line shown in the plan. (5) The line from Ghassar Noon to Jenan Island is very slightly north-east of the red line shown on the plan. It should be noted that the semi-circular reef shown in the plan at point C does not exist. There are numerous shoals and reefs in this area, but none exactly corresponding to that shown on the plan. (6) The names of the southerly and south-easterly islets of the Hawar Group will be ascertained (or allotted) in due course. It ma^ be noted that observations from the air show 18 islands and islets in this group. (7) The positions of points G, H and I have been fixed accurately by latitude and longitude from an Admiralty Chart. The reef shown on the plan at point G should not be taken as accurately delineated. Points H and I lie on the edge of the shoal existing round the Fasht al Jarirn in 1925. It must not be taken that this shoal remains exactly similar now.DESCRIPTION OF THE BOUNDARIES OF THE AREA TO BE OFFERED TO THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COM PANY LIMITED. 0 O 0 From point A on the south-western extremity of one of the twin islets of Bainain (not included in the area), the approximate position of which is 26°15 f N, 50° 19^, in a straight line running in a north-easterly direction to point B, the position of which is 26°21.3 t N, 50 o 42.2 , E; thence in a straight line running in a southerly direction to point C, on the small island of Ghassar Roon (which is included in the area); thence in a straight line running in a south-south westerly direction to the small island of A1 Hool; thence in a straight line running in a north-western direction to Ghassar Rock; thence in a straight line to the starting point A.

I enclose herewith a c opy of a letter dated the 10 th Rabi al Awal 1357 which I have received from Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim of Qatar. 2. In this letter protest is made against 'the inter ference and action taken by the Bahrain Government at Hawar, which is a dependency of Qatar'. It is claimed that Hawar is by geographical position a part of Qatar, but apart from the geographical argument no evidence is offered in support of the Qatar claim. 3. It is true that on my visit to Dohah in February Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim stated that he had received infor mation that the Bahrain Government were building and were drilling for water in Hawar, which they had no right to do. As I reported to you verbally I attempted to draw him by saying that I had always heard that the Bahrain Government claimed Hawar as part of the Bahrain possessions, to which he replied that it was true that they had occupied Hawar but that they had no 'de jure rights' there. He changed the conversation immediately and it was evident that at that time he was by no means prepared to lay a formal claim to the Hawar group of islands. 4. I suggest that in reply to the present communication from Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim I should write and inform him that though the Bahrain Government possess a prima facie claim to the Hawar group of islands which is supported by their formal occupation of them for seme time past, His Majesty's Government would be prepared to give consideration to a formal claim by him provided such a claim were support ed by a full and complete statement of the evidence on which he relied in asserting Qatar sovereignty over this group of islands. I should ask him to forward his statement of evidence/-- 2 - evidence with the least possible da lay, and!if I can receive orders on this reference before my departure for Dohah on the 29th May 1938 I would take the opportunity of impressing upon him verbally the necessity for speed. Meanwhile it may perhaps be desirable to remind him that the Bahrain Govern ment are in point of fact in occupation of the Islands and that His Majesty’s Government would not be prepared to pro hibit or restrict that occupation unless and until a con trary claim were proved and accepted. While therefore his claim is under consideration he must ensare that his sub jects do nothing which might lead to hostilities with the Bahrain subjects now in Hawar. 5. These suggestions will I think be in consonance with the accepted position that Bahrain possesses a prima facie title to the Hawar Islands, but that any contrary claim raised must be decided on its merits. It remains for con sideration whether at this stage it is necessary to inform the Bahrain Government officially (I have done sb unofficial ly) that the Shaikh of Qatar has raised a claim to Hawar, or to call on them to preoare a formal statement of their claim in rebuttal. Personally I incline to the view that it is not at present necessary to call on the Shaikh of Bahrain to prepare a statement of claim with evidence in support, as it remains to be seen whether the Shaikh of Qatar can in fact produce any evidence in support of his claim other than a mere reference to geographical location, which presumably will not by itself serve to contest the Bahrain claim supported as it is, by physical occupation.Translation of a ifettffci' dated 10th R&amp;bi &amp;1 awwal 1357 (10, May 1936) from Shaikn Abdulla bin Qasla al Tnani, C.I«E* # Buler of Qatar, to Ur* H.reightmen, ICC*, Political Agent, Bahrain, A*C* I have the honour to refer to the ilr.~ frlfcnaship, good and strong relations and the treaties v;hich exist between me and iUB^s Governcvent upon vvhich I rely, aftor Ck&gt;a, in all my affairs* In view of this X submitted vsy protests and complaints to the Hon 1 bit the Political Resident in the Persia Gulf and to the Political Agent, Bahrain, in connection with the irregular action taken by Bahrain, 1-% against Qatar, without any real justi fication, and their unusual c ttitude towards me i^hen I took cert ain steps concerning the affairs of my own town end within ray territory* I made a fuxi representation of what had happened and asked on what ground they have taken such actions vhich injured the feelings, broke the ties of friendship in€ disturbed the good neighbourly relations which existed between both parties* Now I see that they h ve done ^ thing which nay create further difficulties* l deem it necessary, therefore, to inform you that these matters may lead to affairs which would be advissbie to avoid* Perhaps you will remember that I told you, in the course of conversation, during your last vi:&gt;it to Dohait about Hawar* I said that Bf&amp;rar is, by Its n^tmral position, a part of and it is not hidden to anyone who is acquainted with geographical and natural condition and seen thr natural position of Hawar that it is, beyond doubt, a part of Qfet^r though it is d Sjsal’.

I take the opportunity to enclose also a note of a further conversation with Ballantyne on the subject. Ballantyne does not yet know what are the areas which the Sheikh proposes to offer to the two companies, and it may T.V.Brenan, Esq., O.B.E., .. . 0 Foreign Office. E.A.Seal, Esq., Admiralty. P. G. Star ling. Esq., Petroleum Department. he/2. ■be that his objections to the idea of division will be appreciably reduced when he learns that it is rjroposed to divide the area in a way that, save for surface rights on Muharraq, will not give Petroleum Concessions a footing- on the main islands and will presumably prevent drilling operations by Petroleum Concessions Limited interfering in any way with Bapco’s fields. If, therefore, the Departments concerned concur in principle in the Sheikh’s proposals we would propose, as soon as instructions have been sent to the Resident, to let both Companies in London know what the Sheikh has in mind. I should add, with reference to Ballantyne’s points, that we do not ourselves think that his Company has any claim to priority in respect of the unallotted area. Indeed the ball was set rolling by Petroleum Concessions Limited over two years ago and Bapco showed not a little hesitation in joining in. In the matter of unneighbourly relations it is probable that, as suggested above, Bailantyne will admit that his objections lose much of their force in the light of the Sheikh’s scheme of division. Moreover the draft concession proposed by Petroleum Concessions Limited (of which we still lack spare copies) contains ■provisions/3 . provisions for the protection of the rights above and below ground of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As it appears that Ballantyne may be s at any rate partiallyp under a misapprehension as to the position and as to what the Sheikh has in mind, v/e should be glad to be able to inform Pov/le that we hove no objection in principle to the division which the Sheikh proposes to offer to the companies, and so be in a position to let the latter know informally of His Highness’s intentions* I am sending a similar letter to Seal and Starling, Brenan and Starling, Brenan and Seal*&lt;£■ • file cop* C P.

A rough sketch map (flagged X) showing the proposed division is attached and if this is compared with the rough sketch map flagged at Y, it will be seen that the Petroleum Concessions Limited are being offered substantially what they seek. It has already been agreed (see submission at P.Z. 3106/38) that the proposed division is a fair one and subject to any further comments which the other interested Departments may have to offer, it is proposed to confirm this view. The proposed arrangements for granting rights to Petroleum Concessions Limited appear to be satisfactory. With regard to paragraph 5 of the Resident’s letter it will be noted that the Sheikh’s terms include a proviso that the arbitration clauses in the commercial concessions should also be invocable in disputes between the two Companies. If this is done it seems unnecessary to draft a separate clause on the lines suggested by the Resident. The terms set out in Mr. Belgrave’s letter appear to be generally suitable and the only point on which any doubt is felt is in regard to the clause preventing Petroleum Concessions Limited from piping oil to Qatar for refinery purposes. This clause must be considered in relation to the Refinery Agreement dated 5th February 1937 (flagged Z) between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions Limited and we might leave it to the Admiralty and the Petroleum Department to raise any objections.

Political Agent, Bahrain, has received a letter dated the 4th May from His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, a copy of which is ? enclosed herewith, together with enclosures setting out in sufficient detail for immediate purposes the areas which he intends ( subject to His Majesty 1 s Government’s approval ) to offer to the two companies, and the terras for which he asks. A rough sketch is also enclosed showing how the areas lie. There has not been time to define the areas by co-ordinates and magnetic bearings, but the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, has very kindly offered to prepare an accurate description of the areas, which will be forwarded to you by the Political Agent, Bahrain. In regard to the areas themselves, I have no further comments to make than that contained in paragraph 4 of my telegram ^loio No. T-126, dated the 2nd May 1938. And I have not found it necessary, at thte stage at any rate, to act on paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference. &gt; /L. *2 tin) 4# In regard to tiie area over which surface rights are to be granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited, the Shaikh of Bahrain has decided to locate this area on Muharraq Island* His object is to ensure, so far as he possibly can, that disputes and difficulties between the two companies should be reduced to a minimum in the event of a new storage installation and/or refinery being constructed in his territory by a second company. With this object I am in entire sympathy and I fully endorse His Highness* views that the surface rights area should be on Muharraq Island* It will be noted that Muharraq Island is at least as well, if not better, situated than an xsx area near Budaiyah in relation to the Islands and •submerged lands** over which the concession is offered to Petroleum Concessions Limited. I need only remark further that the actual location of the surface rights area must necessarily be selected after consultation with the Air Officer ComaaTiding, British Forces in Iraq, in order to ensure that there should be no interference with the Royal Air Force landing ground • His Highness* •terms** contain a provision designed to prevent labour disputes between the two companies ( cf* additional Articles to both Schedules ) and it seems necessary also to draft a clause with the object of obviating such disputes as might arise were either company to attempt to exercise one of the **non-exclusive** rights in the territory of the other, e.g. by building a road, constructing a harbour and so on. On this point in particular the advice of the Petroleum Department is solicited. In regard to the financial terms applicable to the two concessions offered I have no particular comnents to make. It is true that rupee figures tend to sound more impressive than3 SIS than In fact they are and if Hi» Highness* demands for payments prior to the time when royalties become operative are converted into sterling it will, I think, be considered that they are not excessive, particularly for areas so closely adjacent to a proved oil field* 3* The period allowd before drilling operations must commence may be considered somewhat brief, but in practical effect wither company should be able without undue difficulty to comply with them; and it would, in my opinion, be not only improper in respect of His Highness* interests but also highly undesirable in respect of the desiderata of His Majesty*s Government, to urge on His Highness an extension of the period which he lays down* In other words, if drilling is worth while in either of the concessional areas it can and should begin within the period stated* 8.

I must, however, enter a protest again at the suggestion that the claims of a foreign Power might be admitted by His Majesty’s Government if it were thought expedient to do so. I suggest that expediency should play no part in the determination of a foreign claim to territory already claimed by the Shaikh of Bahrain and that such claims should be decided only on their merits. If therefore a communication in the sense suggested is to be conveyed to the Shaikh of Bahrain it should be to the effect that claims by foreign Powers or other Shaikhs to parts of4. / of the concessional areas must be considered and decided by His Majesty’s Government on their merits* I should be grateful for His Majesty 1 * Government’s instructions as soon as possible* Sd/- T*C#:?owle* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Attested. for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*Translation of letter dated 4th May 1938, from Hia Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, to the Political '***' ! 1/09 i After compliments# ' ^^ } 1 A ~/ 1 I have the honour to refer to ou r Adv iae^a^lejbter No# 267 dated 1st }Jay 1937, addressed to you on the aubject of the negotiations between ourselves and the Bahrain Petroh- -eum Company Limited and Petroleum Concessions Limited for concessions over the unallotted area of our dominions# After deep and careful consideration we have decided that it will be most beneficial for ourselves and our country if we divide that area at our disposal and grant two oil con- -cessions over this area, one to our ftiends the Bahrain Petroleum Company who are already working successfully in our country and one to our friends the ^bdoxaJbBSxkzxkxxai ftgmganyx Petroleum Concessions Limited, who we would like to see working in Bahrain. i/Sfe do not propose to commence length negotiations with these two companies, which might very easily cause ill feeling and unpleasantness, so we have stated the areas which we have decided to grant to each company as well as the terms according to which we are prepared to grant the concessions# tfe have endeavoured to make arrangements which will prevent any difficulties between these companies# We considertthat the possibilities of oil being found within the areas referred to are considerably greater than they were thought to be a year ago# We should be grateful if you would ascertain whether the British Government approves of our proposal and if so if you would inform the companies of the terms which we are prapared to accept.

The papers show that the Ruler of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah [Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah], initially wished to divide the Unallotted Area between the two companies, but later wished to award the Unallotted Area in its entirety to BAPCO, subject to the approval of the British Government.The file contains correspondence from representatives of both companies, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Political Agent, Bahrain; British Government departments; Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain; and the Ruler of Bahrain.The papers include: draft PCL agreements; comments on the progress of negotiations by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent, Bahrain; the views of the Foreign Office, Petroleum Department, and the Admiralty; a description by the Political Agent, Bahrain (Hugh Weightman) of the areas to be offered to the two companies, based largely on an aerial survey (folios 536-540); the territorial status of the Hawar Islands; the financial implications of the two potential concessions; minutes of a meeting between British Government officials at the India Office, 7 July 1938 (folios 346-352); the issue of underwater boring for oil, and territorial waters; the role in the negotiations of the PCL representative, Major Frank Holmes; minutes of meetings between the Government of Bahrain and the representative of PCL; minutes of meetings between the Government of Bahrain and the representative of BAPCO; a comparative statement of the offers made by the two companies (folio 94); and a further bid by Holmes and PCL in 1939 for rights over the 'Shoal Area', Bahrain.The Arabic content of the file consists of a letter from the Ruler of Bahrain, with English translation, and the bilingual texts of draft concession agreements between PCL and the Ruler of Bahrain.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bahrain, Āl Khalīfa dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Bahrain</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a6#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
