The papers include: translated copies of memoranda from the Persian Government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announcing various name changes (some of which include place names written in Persian); correspondence amongst British officials over the implications of the changes, particularly that of Persia to Iran, for British interests such as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; British Government instructions to replace Persia for Iran in maps and correspondence; the use of the term ‘Iranian Gulf’ in place of ‘Persian Gulf’ by some organisations, and instruction from British officials that the term ‘Persian Gulf’ should be reinstated; notification of name changes sent by the Foreign Office to the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (care of the Royal Geographical Society).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Cultural change</topic></subject><subject><topic>Place names</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00002c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00002c#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00002c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00002c#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
