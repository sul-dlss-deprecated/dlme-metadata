An experiment has actually been tried at Bahrain as the bases of about a dozen pillars in the court-yard and verandah, open to the sea winds, have been tested to a height of some four br five feet with a mixture of cement and ’PUDLO* . This costing has remained without decay for just over three years. 3. ^ronite* has been proposed instead of ’pudlo 1 as it is believed to be even better than ' pudlo* for preventing the trouble caused by moisture.- 2 - 4. In the circumstances I trust that the Government of India will sanction the complete work. 5. I would only add that the plastering of the walls, which i the Hon'ble the Political Resident and you have seen, has reached a stage of decay which makes it impossible to put off extensive replastering without a risk that the damp of the forthcoming hot weather will cause damage to the mud and coral rock fabric below and so necessitate expensive structural repairs.

This estimate provides for Special repairs to the Agency building at Bahrein* It is noticed that the walls of the Agency Building have hecome infected with damp, both from inside and outsid to a height of about 8 to 10 feet. The superstructure masonry ooamists of*coral stones laid in mud mortar.Thtostones, wnsah is worked out from the bed of the 8*a, is porus and deeply pitted.The gutch, which is always used in local buildings in the Gulf for Plastering i ■ alastaring walls f is also a fjorus sulDstanoe and when exposed vo weather absorbs moisture freely and blisters and disintegrates rapidly under the action of the damp, ^hen protected from wet it makes an excellent plaster ana gives a very smooth finish. At one time the appearance of the damp in wails was attributed to be the result of capillary* attraction through the Ag ej^y of stones,and mud mortar. In 1917 1 with a view to check this,a damp proof course of -Hiberold was inserted and laid on the walls at floor level.This,though, v carried out success fully does not seem to have produced the desired result and the damp continues to appear on the walls. In November 1929,several holes were made in the wal^- to ascertain the effect produced by the insertion of the damp proof course and it was noticed that the Buberoid laid was in very good condition and that there§nfaa no trace of the moisture b d in the walls. From which it oan/safely concluded that the damp appearing in the walls is atmospheric brought in by the sea winds and the prevailing breeae. It is also eaualiy truer that the mud i mortar used in the walls further helps to retain moisture in the gutch plaster. To combat uhis evil it is proposed to ori^o:^ out joints and put on a coat of cement plaster mixed with 'Ironite*. This will give a grey dull appearance, to relieve which it is proposed to oil paint the walls inside those rooms which are used'as offices. Provision is also made for renewing the Verandah floor with 3* thick cement concrete. All works to be done inacoordance with the P. v.jO.

No. 14/13/6 and as requested we are replying by air mail. v*&gt; With regard to your building, you could easily cure the brown stains on the lower part and make it as white as the upper part by first applying a coat of Walpamur Primer and after wards one or two coats^ of Walpamur mixed with their petrifying liquid and in order to help you we have spoken to the Walpamur Co.Ld. (London and Darwen) and they have promised to write you by air mail with full particulars and to send you the name of the nearest place you could obtain supplies. Failing the use of Walpamur, an^T alternative would be to apply two coats of size and afterwards follow on with ordinary whitewash distemper.

EXPORT DEPARTMENT RB/AP The Political Agent, BAHREIN, Persian Gulf 16th January 1934 Dear Sir, AIR MAIL We understand from the Ironite Go.Ltd* of London that you have written to them in connection with the decoration of the exterior of your house, and at their request we have pleasure in giving you the follov/ing information. Owing to the n ture of the cement in question the use of a Water Paint is not desirable as it is absolutely necessary to avoid water from getting into contact with the iron content of the cement, and Y/e therefore* recommend the application of an oil paint such as our Tropical hite Ferox Ready Mixed Paint to minimize the trouble. If, however, it is a case of touching up certain v/alls(Y/hich are defective) to bring them in uniform condition with other existing walls we suggest that a coat of oil paint or r 7/alpamur , Oil Primer be applied, and when hard finished off with Walpamur* to match existing satisfactory surfaces. We regret that we have no Stockists of our materials within easy reach of Bahrein, but we should be pleased to supply you direct with any of our products you may desire. over' ENAMELS * VARNISHESmm The above prices are based F.o.b.

The tint card was, however, omitted. 2. My problem is that the outside and inside walls of the ground floor of this house have been treated with Ironite in the following way. The walls are of coral rock and local plaster. The plaster has been raked out and a filling some ij inches thick cement, sand and ironite applied. On the filling has been added a thin, but richer, coat of cement and ironite. The intention is to prevent moisture (a) from exuding from the coral rocK inside the wall and (b) from congesting on the wall as it used to do on the local plaster. The rich outer coa€ing of cement and ironite has already rusted brown and I wish to paint it pure white (a) to match the ordinary whitewash of the upper storey outside, and (b) to help the lighting of the inside of the rooms. The Ironite has rusted pretty heavily . 3. we frequently have very moist winds which precipitate moisture on the walls. 4. I should be obliged if you would send me a small quantity (sufficient to experiment on a few square feet of wallsy?xi 9 ' — 2 — wall (a) of Tropical White Ferox Ready Mixed Paint and (b) of Walpanur Oil Primer. These should be sent by ordinary parcel post and the cost recovered by the C.O.D. system. 5. I should be obliged if you would send me detailed directions as to how to use them and in particular let me know if I should rub off (with a bit of gunny) specks of rust on the surface of the wall.

I do not thiidt that gutcliing wil± prove satisTaotory or permanent - and if it was necessary to pxasier with water proofing materiaa aux the rest of the agency, x find it difficuxt to credit that it is sufficient to pxaster the more exposed portions with gutch. ucaversely, if the pudic oases of the pillars and wall now in question were sufficient it is curious that the present expensive and complicated ironite project should have heen recommended. I understood when 1 arrived that the whole Agency was to he done with ironite: and, indeed, actually balked cf these courtyard pillars with the Assistar engineer when going round on the 17th inarch 1933. 1 cannot hexp feeling that the omission to carry out the ironite process axl over the agency was due to an oversight when estimating.

The surface should be well scoured v/ith a fine wire brush to remove as much rust as possible. We do not think the use of gunny for this purpose would be sufficiently abrasive to effect removal of the rust. Following above treat ent the surface may be coated with two coats of Ferox Tropical v/hite, thinning the first coat to priming cons! tency with equal parts Raw linseed Oil and Turpentine or 'Thite Spirits. Alloy/ to dry and then for second coat apply Tropical White thinned with two parts raw linseed Oil and one part Turpentine. This treatment will dry with an oil gloss finish.

The Standard Flat Finish. ‘ WALPAMUR ’ is an oil bound non-poisonous flat paint supplied in paste form and made ready for use by thinning with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid or water. It is washable, durable and fire-retarding, and presents a smooth velvety finish which is non-absorbent and hygienic. It is basically different from distemper and is far superior to this old-fashioned material in appearance, durability and general utility. 4 WALPAMUR ’ is capable of extremely versatile decorative treatment such as sponged, stippled, ' chamotex ” and relief effects, and is suitable for application by either brushing or spraying. FOR EXTERIOR WORK a special quality is made in suitable colours. This should be thinned with Petrifying Liquid only. The colours in which this quality is obtainable are detailed in the index to the shade books and are indicated by an asterisk on the tint cards. The spreading capacity of ‘ Walpamur ’ is approxi mately 350 square yards (two coats) per cwt. of paste body colour when thinned to proper working consistency and applied to normal surfaces. WALPAMUR PETRIFYING LIQUID. Used as a thinner for ‘ Walpamur ’ this liquid adds to the durability and tends to improve the appearance by checking surface porosity. It also adds smoothness and coolness to the working, which features combine to give greater spreading capacity. Approximately 2| gallons of Petrifying Liquid are required to thin 1 cwt. paste body colour ‘ Walpamur ’ to working consistency. WALPAMUR PRIMER. Is a specially prepared oil medium capable of properly penetrating and sealing any loosely bound particles remaining after removal of limewash, size bound distempers, etc. It seals surface porosity and provides a perfect foundation for ‘ Walpamur.’ It is supplied in transparent form and in a range of tints suitable for use with standard tints of ‘ Walpamur.’ Spreading capacity about 100 to 120 square yards per gallon, one coat. WALPAMUR STAINERS. Are manufactured for the purpose of producing special tints which cannot conveniently be obtained by intermixing stock shades of ‘ Walpamur.’ Where such a course is necessary no other 6ifiUi. 7 form of stainers should be used. These stainers possess powerful staining properties and can, if desired, be used alone for decorative work, such as picking out, stencilling, etc. Size. —On no account should any surface be sized prior to the application of ‘ Walpamur.’ Varnishing. ‘Walpamur’ may be varnished if desired, after allowing 3 days to harden. It is strongly recommended that pale varnish be used such as Yeoman No. 5020 White Oil Copal Varnish. Stippling. —For general work ‘Walpamur’ does not require stippling, but the finishing coat may be so treated if desired. SPECIFICATION W. 1. New Lime Plaster (Not Dry). —Two coats ‘Walpamur.’ 1st Coat. —‘Walpamur’ mixed to a moderately thin consistency with water only. Apply liberally, brush well, lay off evenly, and allow to harden. 2nd Coat. —‘ Walpamur’ in a similar manner, adding a minimum quantity of water. Note. —New Lime Plaster should be left as long as possible before treatment. Care should be exercised in the choice of colours for use on such surfaces. The following are recommended as most suitable:— Nos. 9, 10, 17, 18, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 61, 63, 64, 74, and 78. SPECIFICATION W.2. New (Dry) Lime Plaster (a minimum period of 9 months after plastering). Two coats ‘ Walpamur. Glass paper where necessary to remove plaster nibs, etc. 1st Coat.— 'Walpamur' thinned to proper working consistency with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid only. Lay off evenly. 2nd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned as for 1st coat, apply liberally, lay off evenly. Note. —Defective plaster work to be made good with a mixture of Patent Plaster and ‘ Walpamur.’ SPECIFICATION W. 3. New (Dry) Lime Plaster (a minimum period of 9 months after plastering)—where special conditions prevail. Primer and two coats ‘ Walpamur. Glass paper where necessary to remove plaster nibs, etc. 1st Coat.—' Walpamur ’ Primer, brush well, allow to dry thoroughly. 2nd Coat.—' Walpamur ’ thinned to proper working consistency with ‘Walpamur’ Petrifying Liquid only. Lay off evenly.8 3rd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned as for 2nd coat, apply liberally, lay off evenly. Note. —All defective plaster work to be made good with Patent Plaster prior to application of 1st coat. If for any reason only two coats are to be applied, specify Walpamur Tinted Primer for the first coat and omit the 3rd coat. SPECIFICATION W.4. Keen’s Cement, Parian Cement and Sirapite Plaster (Dry). —Primer and one or two coats ‘ Walpamur.’ Glass paper where necessary to remove plaster nibs, etc. 1st Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ Tinted Primer, brush well, allow to dry thoroughly. 2nd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned to proper working consistency with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid only. 3rd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned as for 2nd coat, apply liberally, lay off evenly. Note. —Where it is desired to provide a decorative finish immediately to the above, the surface should be treated as first coat above within 12 hours after trowelling. This specification applies only where the plaster has been used neat. Where a two coat finish is desired, omit the 3rd coat above. SPECIFICATION W. 5. Hard Wall Plasters. (a) Containing Lime. Such surfaces when not thoroughly dry should be treated as for Specification W.l. When dry they should be treated as for Specification W. 2 or W. 3. (b) Used Neat. Where it is desired to decorate before the plaster is dry treat as for Specification W.l. When dry the surface may be treated as for Specification W. 6. SPECIFICATION W. 6. Fibrous Plaster. —Primer and two coats ‘ Walpamur.’ 1st Coat. —Walpamur Primer, brush well, allow to dry thoroughly. 2nd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned to proper working consistency with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid. 3rd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned as for 2nd coat. Apply liberally, lay off evenly. Note. —If for any reason only two coats are to be applied, specify Walpamur Tinted Primer for the first coat and omit 3rd coat. SPECIFICATION W. 7. New Portland Cement. (Interior and Exterior.) It is strongly recommended that the surface be allowed to dry out as long as possible before treatment. New Cement surfaces which have become thoroughly dry and properly carbonated may be treated as per Specification for New (Dry) Lime Plaster W. 2 and W. 3.9 r New Cement surfaces which have become thoroughly dry, but are still of an alkaline nature can be prepared by applying a wash of 30% Zinc Sulphate Solution (3 lbs. to 1 gallon water) used hot. Allow same to dry in and treat as follows :— 1st Coat. —Yeoman No. 5081 Cement Primer. Brush well. Allow to dry thoroughly. 2nd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned to proper working consistency with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid. 3rd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ as 2nd coat. Lay off evenly. New Cement surfaces which are not thoroughly dry should be treated as per Specification W. 1 for New Lime Plaster (Wet) except that 1st coat be applied fairly round in consistency when the texture of the cement is of a coarse nature. For exterior work outside quality ‘ Walpamur ’ and Petrifying Liquid should always be used. SPECIFICATION W. 8. Asbestos Cement Sheets. (Interior and Exterior)*. Asbestos Cement Sheets are generally of a strong alkaline nature, even when free from moisture. The sheets do not carbonate or neutralise as quickly as lime plaster or cement and sand surfaces, owing to being hard and compressed. The sheets should be dry before treatment. When the sheets are thoroughly dry but new and of an alkaline nature, the surface should be treated as for New Cement of the same condition—Specification W.7. Where the sheets are thoroughly dry and carbonated, they can be treated as per specifications for New (Dry) Lime Plaster W. 2 and W. 3. Where there is any danger of dampness, Asbestos Cement Sheets should be treated with a heavy application of smudge Oil Paint on the backs before fixing, in order to prevent the penetration of moisture. For exterior work outside quality ‘Walpamur’ should always be used. SPECIFICATION W. 9. Surfaces previously treated with Water Paint (interior) —two coats ‘ Walpamur.’ Thoroughly wash down with warm water to remove all dirt and grease and where necessary scrape to remove all loose material, make good all defective plaster work with a mixture of Patent Plaster and ‘ Walpamur.’ Allow to dry. 1st Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned to proper consistency with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid.2nd Coat.—' Walpamur ’ thinned as for 1st coat, apply liberally, lay off evenly. Note, —Where it is found necessary to make extensive repairs to plaster, we recommend that same be made good with patent plaster and touched up with Shellac Knotting or Sharp Oil Paint before applying 1st coat. SPECIFICATION W. 10. Surfaces previously treated with Water Paint (interior). —Primer and two coats ‘ Walpamur.’ Thoroughly wash down with warm water to remove all dirt and grease and where necessary scrape to remove all loose material. Allow all moisture to dry out, make good all defective plaster work with patent plaster prior to applying 1st coat. 1st Coat. —Walpamur Primer, brush well, allow to dry thoroughly. 2nd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned to proper consistency with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid. 3rd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned to proper consistency with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid. Apply liberally, lay off evenly. Note. —The above procedure is recommended where the surface is known to be already heavily coated with water paint. Walpamur Primer binds down and imparts elasticity to the existing film. If for any reason only two coats are to be applied, specify Walpamur Tinted Primer for the first coat and omit 3rd coat. SPECIFICATION W. 11. Surfaces previously treated with Old Size Bound Distemper, Limewash, etc. (Interior and Exterior). Primer and two coats ‘ Walpamur.’ Thoroughly wash with water and scrape to remove all loose material. Allow all moisture to dry out. On interior work make good all defective plaster with suitable patent plaster prior to applying 1st coat. 1st Coat. —Walpamur Primer. Brush well.

Note. —If for any reason only two coats are to be applied, specify Walpamur Tinted Primer for the first coat and omit the 3rd coat. Absorbent Wall Boards. —In the case of Absorbent Wall Boards Walpamur Primer must be used and two coats of ‘ Walpamur ’ are recommended. SPECIFICATION W. 13. Old Oil Painted Surfaces (Interior). Where the surface still retains great elasticity, it is not recommended that ‘ Walpamur ’ be used, as the expansion of the old oil paint would be liable to cause cracking. In such cases where a flat finish is desired we recommend Muromatte Flat Oil Paint. ‘Walpamur’ may, however, be successfully used and is constantly being used on old oil painted surfaces which are no longer elastic. Treat as for Specifications W 9. and W. 10 for previously water painted surfaces, substituting the following preparation : Thoroughly wash the surface to remove dirt and grease and rub down with waterproof sandpaper or pumice stone. Allow to dry thoroughly. SPECIFICATION W. 14. Papered Surfaces. Where the existing paper is firmly adhering to the surface and is self colour of a nature which will not bleed, there is no necessity to strip prior to treatment with ‘ Walpamur.’ Where the existing paper has colour which may bleed (such as papers printed in mica, gold, reds, etc.) it should either be treated with one thin coat of Yeoman Stop Tar Knotting No. 5075 or removed before treating the surface with ‘ Walpamur.’ Where paper is removed, care should be taken to wash off all traces of paste and allow all moisture to dry out. After completion of the above preparatory work, the surface may be treated as for New (Dry) Lime Plaster See Specifications W. 2 and W. 3.SPECIFICATION W. 15. Old Portland Cement, Roughcast, Brick and Stone Surfaces. (Interior and Exterior). Primer and two coats ‘ Walpamur.’ Thoroughly brush down with wire brush to remove all loose material. 1st Coat. —Walpamur Primer, brush well, allow to dry thoroughly. 2nd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned to proper working consistency with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid. 3rd Coat. —' Walpamur ’ as for 2nd coat. The surface must be free from moisture at the time of painting. Note. —Where the surface is known to be very porous, the Primer must always be used for 1st coat. Where the surface is firm and not of a porous nature, the first or priming coat may be dispensed with. Where the surface is known to be very porous and if for any reason only two coats are to be applied, specify Walpamur Tinted Primer for the first coat and omit 3rd coat. For exterior work outside quality ‘ Walpamur ’ and Petrifying Liquid should always be used. SPECIFICATION W. 16. Surfaces previously Water Painted (Exterior).— Two coats ‘ Walpamur.’ Thoroughly brush down with wire brush to remove all loose material. 1st Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned to proper working consistency with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid. 2nd Coat. —‘ Walpamur ’ thinned as for 1st coat. Lay off evenly. Note. —Where it is known that the surface is already heavily coated with water paint or is of a powdery nature, a coat of ‘ Walpamur ’ Primer should be applied before proceeding with this Specification. SPECIFICATION W. 17. Old Oil Painted Surfaces (Exterior.) Where the surface still possesses great elasticity, it is not recommended that ‘ Walpamur ’ be used, as the expansion of the old oil paint would be liable to cause cracking. Exterior quality ‘ Walpamur ’ may, after removal of dirt, be successfully used on old oil painted surfaces which are free from elasticity, Specification W. 16 being adopted. Where any portion of the old paint has scaled and left absorbent patches they should be touched up with Walpamur Primer prior to applying 1st coat. 12DECORATIVE EFFECTS IN BROKEN COLOUR AND RELIEF WORK OBTAINABLE WITH ‘ WALPAMUR.’ Plain schemes of self colour in ‘ Walpamur ’ are very popular, and the distinctive velvety finish leaves nothing to be desired. If, however, broken colour effects are required in a decorative scheme they can easily and economically be obtained on any of the surfaces mentioned in the foregoing (interior) specifications, by over sponging or mottling suitable additional colours over the selected ground colour, as described below. SPECIFICATION W. 18. Walpamur Sponged Effect. ExamplePrimrose, Old Gold and Ivory Scheme. Apply a solid ground of No. 28 Primrose ‘ Walpamur,’ and when dry take a sponge of the open mesh type. With this apply No. 30 Old Gold ‘ Walpamur ’ by dabbing colour over the ground so as to give a broken, but even, distribution of this second colour. Oyer-sponge this in a similar manner using No. 25 Ivory ‘ Walpamur.’ Note. —Generally the best results are obtained by using the middle tone for the ground colour, and a darker and lighter shade respectively for the over-sponging. The ‘ Walpamur’ must be thinned with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid. SPECIFICATION W. 19. Walpamur “ Chamotex ” Effect. —Example : Old Gold, Malachite and Sea Green Scheme. Apply a solid ground of No. 30 Old Gold ‘Walpamur’ and when dry, using thin colour in patches, apply No. 6 Malachite and No. 34 Sea Green, and with a fresh brush partly merge these two tints into each other. While still wet, flog the surface with the loose ends of a chamois or washleather. This will give a broken colour effect of pleasing softness. A variety of effects can be obtained by rolling or mottling the surface with moist washleathers. Note. —It is essential the colours used over the ground should be thin so as to give a translucent glaze, using Walpamur Petrifying Liquid for thinning. An alternative method is to apply the No. 6 Malachite thin (on the solid ground of No. 30 Old Gold) to the whole surface and while wet roll with a washleather. Allow to dry thoroughly and apply and roll the No. 34 Sea Green in a similar manner. SPECIFICATION W. 20. Walpamur Relief Effects. Decorative effects in Relief Work of various textures can be obtained by the use of ‘ Walpamur ’ in conjunction with Plaster of Paris, thus providing unlimited oppor tunities for original and artistic craftsmanship, at a cost which allows it to be widely used in Interior andExterior Decorative work. The method of obtaining these effects is as follows :— Equal parts (by weight) of ‘ Walpamur ’ (any shade) and fine Plaster of Paris are thoroughly mixed together and thinned with Walpamur Petrifying Liquid to the desired consistency. For Exterior work. Keen’s Cement should replace Plaster of Paris and Exterior quality ‘ Walpamur ’ should be used. The higher the relief desired the thicker the composition should be used, and vice versa for low relief effects. It is important to note that the consistency should be controlled by the amount of Petrifying Liquid used for thinning, and not by altering the relative proportions of ‘ Walpamur ’ and Plaster of Paris. The above proportions are so selected to yield a product with the maximum of resistance to wear and tear without giving too sharp a relief. In order to secure perfect adhesion of the composition where the surface is of a porous nature, the latter should first be given a coat of sharp oil paint and allowed to dry. The tools required for the process are a set of hand boards from 3' to 9' square, of which the edges of the face side are round and a bridge handle fitted to the back. Variously shaped steel and wood combs can also be used. For high relief effects the composition should be used about the thickness of skimming plaster and applied to the surface with a short, flat wall brush. A variety of textures can be produced by flogging the coated surface with the same brush and, if desired, by using the edge of a handboard to produce indented lines or by gently pressing a handboard on the surface of the wet composition, and then lifting it off, taking care to avoid any side movement. Repeated flogging of the composition with the flat wall brush or repeated use of the board over the same surface will produce much finer textures. The combs may be used to break the surface in producing border effects, etc. When the composition has set, further effects can be obtained by the judicious use of either ‘ Walpamur Water Paint or Walpamur Stainer, the selected colours or tints being thinned with ‘ Walpamur ’ Petrifying Liquid to semi-transparency, applied over the surface and removed from the high parts of the rehef by means of a sponge or washleather, thus leaving the newly applied shades showing where there is no relief, and the original ‘ Walpamur ’ standing out on those parts of the high relief, over which the sponge or washleather has been passed. An unlimited number of colour effects can be produced, such as antique leathers, metallic finishes, etc., etc., by painting the surface in suitable ground colours and scumbling or over glazing, removing the colour from the Gloss or flat varnishes may be used tor imisnmg me work if desired. t V h15 MUROMATTE FLAT OIL PAINT. A specially prepared Flat Oil Paint of superlative quality for inside use only. Guaranteed Leadless under the terms of the Lead Paint Act, 1926.

Where the existing paper is firmly adhering to the surface and is self colour of a nature which will not bleed, there is no necessity to strip prior to treatment with Muromatte. Where the existing paper has colour which may bleed (such as Mica, Gold, Reds, etc.) it should either be treated with one thin coat of Yeoman Stop Tar Knotting No. 5075, or removed before treating the surface with Muromatte. Where paper is removed care should be taken to wash off all traces of paste and allow all moisture to dry out. After completion of the above preparatory work, the surface may be treated as for New (Dry) Lime Plaster M.3. SPECIFICATION M. 13. Blended Effects in Muromatte. The beautiful and artistic effects which are now so popular and which are arrived at by blending two or more colours, can be easily and inexpensively obtained by using Muromatte, as owing to the composition of this paint it is pre-eminently suitable for work of this description. A wide range of colours is available and the decorator can produce almost any effect desired. Blending of Muromatte tints may be carried out in various methods, the most popular of which is as follows : Groundwork.— A solid ground should be produced in Muromatte using the palest tint selected for the scheme and proceeding according to one of the foregoing* specifications governing the nature of the surface. The final coat of ground colour should be thinned with two parts Raw Rinseed Oil and one part Turpentine, and allowed 24 hours to harden. Blending. —Commencing at the top, apply the palest tint horizontally to the desired depth, then apply the second tint in a like manner and blend the two tints immediately by stippling horizontally across the surface and gradually working downwards. If there are more tints in the scheme proceed in the above manner applying the paint liberally in order to obtain perfect blending. On large surfaces, and particularly where the colours vary greatly in strength it is advisable to mix intermediate tints of the colours to be blended. This facilitates manipulation and renders stippling easier. Where the colours selected vary considerably in strength we recommend that to obtain solidity the last coat of groundwork be roughly blended in accordance with the scheme. Another method is to prepare the groundwork in white and proceed in a similar manner to the above, using the colours thin so as to give a translucent glaze. Muromatte may be thinned with Oil and Turpentine or with Turpentine only, according to the finish desired. * * SPECIFICATION M. 14. Broken Colour Effects in Muromatte. Some charming decorative effects can be produced by mottling one or more colours of Muromatte over a Muromatte ground. Having made a judicious choice of colours, the scheme should be carried out by the method described in Walpamur Specification W. 18, using Turpentine only for thinning the finishing colours. SPECIFICATION M. 15. To obtain Semi-Gloss Finish with Muromatte Flat Oil Paint. Where it is desired to obtain a semi-gloss finish to any of the surfaces given in the foregoing Specifications, the finishing coat must be thinned with one part Genuine Raw Linseed Oil and two parts Turpentine, and should not be applied until the previous coat has been allowed to harden thoroughly. We recommend this semi-gloss as a sound and durable finish if Muromatte is applied on surfaces which are subjected to acute condensation as in Bathrooms and Kitchens. * i 20DURADIO ENAMEL PAINT. A specially prepared Enamel Paint which can be relied upon to give the most efficient and durable high gloss finish.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose an estimate prepared by the Overseer of the Public Works Department at my request for special repairs to the courtyard and lower storey verandahs of the Bahrain Agency. 2* The flooring of the courtyard and verandahs is very worn and uneven. It is impossible to keep it clean and the holes and interstices get filled with mud and water, which in the climate of Bahrain seldom dries up. The place is dirty, unsightly and rough under foot, and the radical Officer reports that its present state is unhealthy both for the offices below and for the residential part of the Agency above. I am not certain that the cement plaster proposed is the best means of re-flooring the courtyard and verandahs which are exposed to the corrupting wet winds of Bahrain and I would request that the advice of the Assistant Eingineer may be obtained.■ * i . 4. if possible, I should like the work carried out during my absence in the forthcoming hot weather.

I would request a reference to the attached plan which shows where the servants* quarters of the Bahrain Agency are situated* There are two blocks, •A* which contains ten quarters and *B• which contains five quarters. The building at *C # is a block of six stables, one of which has been fitted with a door and is used as a garage. This arrangement of the servants* quarters and stables, though unduly close to the Agency building, did not matter much in the past, as all visitors rode and came through the main entrance. Cars, which are now universally used, have to proceed by the red dotted lines through the gate *D*, and must pass by the servants* quarters and stables* It is not fitting that visitors to the Agency (inrOnrHng2* for example* the Ruler of Bahrain) should have to enter through suoh surroundings* When the new wing is huilt, it will he preferable for the old main gate *3* to he made passable for motors and for the motor way to lead up to the main entrance as shown on the plan in blue dotted lines* but this postulates the removal of the servants* quarters block *A # . The present gate # B* would cease to exist* 4* The servants* quarters themselves, both block *A* and block , B , f are very old, cramped and delapidated. They are of local construction of coral rock, hewn out of the sea, and are so impregnated with salt, that it is impossible to keep them dry, and the Medical Officer, in condemning them on the grounds of their dampness, lack of ventilation and unhealthy condition, reports that much of the illness among servants of the Agency is due to the state of these quarters. It is impossible to reconstruct them, and patching does not improve them and is a waste of good money, 5. The Political Agent now employs Arabs, who live out, for the crew of the launch and is, therefore, prepared to have fewer servants* quarters, that is to say eleven quarters in place of the existing fifteen quarters. He proposes (a) to remove the old stables and garage (0 An plan), which are as old and delapidated as the servants* quarters, as there will be too great a congestion when the new wing is built, and ib) to build new servants* quarters and to provide a garage as shown in green dotted lines on the plan* The removal of the old stables, some of which were used as storerooms, will k adjacent necessitate the provision of two store-rooms to the servants* quarters. 6.

Political Besident in the Persian Gulf. Tfc The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla* Installation of Water-Dome sanitation and a running water supply in the bathrooms of the Bahrain Agency. Sir, I have the honour to recommend that water-borne sanitation and a running water supply should be installed in the bathrooms of the Bahrain Agency* 2. 1 would request a glance at the enclosed plan, which shows how publicly the sweepmr has to carry out his duties. 3* In the past the Agency was shut off, the surrounding houses and huts were squalid and the use of this comer of the beach by the sweeper was not open to any great objection* Wow, the main sea road, which is a promenade for all and sundry and is the main way to the Post Office and to the Agency, runs by this comer and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government's house is Just across the road* The sweeper's path of duty lies past the Indian Assistant*i Court, at which there will always be throngs of persons of high and low degree and he has, moreover, to cross the motor pathway to the sea entrance to the Agency, so may appear just as the Shaikh of Bahrain or any other visitor drives past. It is most unseemly that the sweeper should have to do his work in such a place. 4* There is no other place at which the sweeper can have access to the sea, the nature of the ground renders it impossible to dispose of the matter by burial and the congestionc: congestion of the Agency area and lack of fuel precludes any form of incineration. The water-horne system can he arranged to discharge into the sea. 5. Apart from these more cogent considerations, the primitive sanitary system of the Agency has been the subject of ribald (though, I am bound to admit, not unhuraourous) comment both by the American otaff of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and by visitors both from Burope and India, and it is not fitting that this should be so. ^ 1 should, I think, explain that all the houses (even rented houses) of the employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company are fitted as a matter of course with high-class wrC water borne sanitation, baths and so on, that the American Missio have had these conveniences for sometime and that the houses cf the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, the Director of Customs and a number of local people have also been so fitted in the last year or two. 5. 1, therefore, recommend that a water-home system of sanitation should be provided for the four bathrooms in the Agency. 7. 1 also recommend that the opportunity should be taken of installing running water in the bathrooms of the Agency. The Political Agent has to put up a continual stream of visitors and the present system which involves oarrying all water up a flight of steep stairs some 20 feet high and along a narrow sweeper^ verandah is most inconvenient. One of the two guest rooms is a double room and it is sometimes necessary also to put two guests into the single room. But there is only onq small bathroom in each of these rooms and ££ dressing rooms, and the present arrangements for sanitation and water supply are, therefore, most unsuitable. I, therefore, recommend that a piped cold water supply should be laid on and that modem washhand basins and baths be installed.

It appears, however, that a letter from the overseer-in-charge dated the 4th March 1934 enquiring from the Assistant Engineer whether he should pass on the completion certificate to you, went astray, and the matter was consequently overlooked* Mr. Fatehali Shaikh seems satisfied that this letter was actually written as he has seen the office copy of Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, it.

The work was carried out departmentally and the expenditure incurred thereon was accounted for as usual, Mr. Fatehali Shaikh informs me that a completion certi ficate pertaining to a work which has already been com pleted has nothing to do with the accounting for the expenditure incurred, and serves no useful purpose at « this stage.

The principle of division of costs would extend also to works expenditure and pending settlement of the general question raised by us a scheme for additional accommodation at Bahrein Agency which is urgent in view of increasing importance of Bahrein and constant influx of official guests has been held up. The cost of Y-orks outlay is estimated at Fte. 22,000/- and if His Majesty’s Grovernment accept general principle in regard to division of expenditure, the works expenditure reierred to will be divisible on the analogy of Kuwait agency buildings and require previous approval His Majesty’s Government.

Bnhrain Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Assistant Engineer is preparing estimates for an urgent repair to the roof and floor of the drawing room of the Bahrain Agency* 2* I have for some time regarded with misgiving the state of the roof of the drawing room which sags badly and in which some chandals have now broken* The floor is shaky and on the last occasion on which I held a party indoors the evening turned cold and everyone crowded into the drawing room, and I had serious fears about its safety* 3* I think that I should explain that the house is built in local style and that although there are strong wooden beams in the centre of both the roof and floor of the drawing room the span covered by the chandals is considerably greater than such material should be used^here is no question but that the r of and floor should be replaced by a stronger structure, but I write to urge that the work should be carried out without delay as the drawing room is literally the only room in the house in which I can receive the Shaikh, hold parties or entertain my numerous guests* I have no other sitting room and the dining room is too small and otherwise unsuitable to such purposes* l*y office is a merely converted bedroom* The room below is the Political Agent’s Court Room and business will be hampered while it is out of use* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.D.O.No.18/6.1087 1936. — 28th April trill yeu kindly refer to your demi-official letter No.166/19/137-V dated the 19th March 1936.

Upstairs, where the walls are drier, I have panelled the verandahs (closed in) with three plywood painted on both sides with brovm Solignum and nailed straight into the gutch walls. This has proved a great blessing; water does not congeal on it and the Solignum keeps away fish insects. I found it cheaper to import three plywood than/- Captain J.E.A.

Further it would be desirable to take this up for consideration^ after a decision is reached on the transfer of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrain, since if the Resident eventually takes up his residence at Bahrain it would relieve pressure on the Agency accommodation and it might be unnecessary to add the annexe to the Agent’s residence/y l^l \ residence.

This form of water-proofing has now been superseded by Ironite ('No.l) and Cement Slurry as this method is found to give better results. We are therefore stocking only Ironite No.l and for purposes of water-proofing damp surfaces, we recommend a slurry made of 1 part of Ironite No.l and 3 Darts, of Portland Cement and used as per specification enclosed. Ironite and Cement slurry, when laid, will give rather a slightly rough surface and if the dampness on the inside of your walls is due to percolation of water from the outside, we would advise you to treat the wall on the outside. It will of course be necessary to clean the surface thoroughly free of all foreign matter, such as paint or distemper before applying the slurry. We do not know the actual cause of your trouble but if it is considered essential to treat the wall on the inside, we would suggest replastering the wall in the following manner.- Mix 20 lbs. of Ironite to 100 lbs. Cement thoroughly whilst dry to an even colour. Add to it 4 parts of clean sand (free from salt) by bulk. Mix it thoroughly. Make the mortar in the usual way. We enclose Specification for the purpose. We now answer your queries as under: 1 . SHADE . Ironite is a black metallic powder of which a sample is sent at your request. After application, it turns greyish with a few brown spots interspersed. This is the natural result of the oxidation of Ironite and is a sure sign that Ironite is functioning. If a red colour is required, you should add 6 parts of pure Red OxideRed Oxide of Iron to 1 part of Ironite, mix it thoroughly. Afterwards 20 lbs. of Ironite is added to every 100 lbs. of cement and Oxide of mixture. Add 4 parts of clean sand and use the plaster in the usual way. Mixing of other colours is not recommended. 2. The Ironite surface can be painted or distempered in the usual way. 3. Specification enclosed. 4. Ironite is packed in 1 cwt. bags and we quote R 8 .50/- (rupees fiftyo nly) per cwt. F.O.B. Bombay. In the event of y ur having to lay any floors you should follow the Specification for flooring strictly. Should you require any further information, we shall be pleased to hear.ss err yc&lt;x^&lt;^ I shd liKe to see at once xii invoices or orders/for all material used in the plastering repairs now in progress ironite , cement and sand, * &gt;4.11.33 A.

Both the paints stood very well for the first two weeks,but during the third week a few red spots were noticed coming through the Walpamur paint,and Tropical White Ferroxide did not show any sign of the red spots.On the 29th of July it has been noticed that the red spots are increasing on the surface treated with Walpamur and also some of the red stains are appear ing on the surface treated with Tropical White Ferroxide.lt has also been noticed that on wet days if these red spots are rubbed with hands they spoil the white paint. It is further noticed that these red spots are appearing only on places where the Ironite was coming out in its deep colours or salty patches of the wall and on sweet portions both the paints seem to stand well so far.
