He speaks about his upbringing and arts education in the American South, professional work in Canada, and the volunteer work and teaching and Africa that led him to come to AUC. Campbell describes the Department of Performing and Visual Arts (later Department of the Arts), and its Art, Music, Film, and Theater programs, faculty and staff members, facilities, and the approaches to the department taken by Deans and other AUC administrators. He offers a detailed view of the Theater Program, including its curriculum, personnel, performing spaces on the downtown campus, visiting guest artists, and its students and graduates. His own work as a scenic designer is covered, with a discussion of the approaches he took toward the set design of particular plays. A detailed account of the planning for arts and especially theater spaces on the New Cairo campus is provided, including features and shortcomings of those facilities, as well as more general observations of the move to the new campus. Campbell also tells about life as a foreign resident in Cairo, including experiences of the 2011 revolution. He recounts his efforts on behalf of Sub-Saharan African refugees in Cairo, including drama-based programs he coordinated at downtown St. Andrewâ€™s Church, and recalls the aftermath of the 2005 massacre of refugee demonstrators in Mohandiseen.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>oral histories</dc:type><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017; American University in Cairo.
