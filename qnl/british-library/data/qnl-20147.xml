'Perseusto Cajytain Field R.N,, Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf Division/' 4. + + + + + J. Shortly before noon on the 24th inst .* a vessel under steam was observed to be entering Koweit har bour, which I had no difficulty in recognising short ly afterwards as the Turkish sloop-of-war '7ohaf\ Per movements were not easy to understand y for after making Ras-al~Arz and heading uj the harbour, she appeared to be making no progress, ana when at a dis tance of six miles from the town and anchorage appeared to have anchored. I watched her (meanwhile raising steam for 12 Jmots) until 3 PJL when she was still motionless, and thinking it possible she mtenaeo. to approach no nearer, and might contemplate landing troop'S in that vicinity, T weighed anchor and stood towards her. Upon this dense clouds of smoke issued from her funnels, and she was seen to be again under wayway and heading for the anchorage. Accordingly I returned ana anchored in my former position to the S,E, of Fasht-al-Haduba shoal, as near the touit as possible, ana awaited her arrival. 6, At 5 P.M. the 'Zonaf v anchored, to the of Fasht-al-Haduha shoal ana I immediately went on board acco mpan i e d by ''r ' -i 1 ma 7i, Cle rk, an a t h e Interpreter % The 'Zo'aaf*s f upper deck was croudea with sacks of flour and other stores y but J could see no troops on board, or men other than those apparently forming the crew, 7. I enquired of the Captain of the v Zonaf v (whose rank he informed me was that of Commander) the reason of his visit to Koweit , how long he proposed to stay , and whether he was going on to other ports. He replied, with eviaent desire to say as little as possible, that he had business with the Sheikh, that his orders were to go to Koweit only, and that he could not say now lonr he might stay. I gathered further tna*- ne : aa left Basra on Thursday the 22nd inst. 8. In accordance with my instructions I then informed him that the British Government had . dec i ded00147 11. decided to support Sheikh ' ■ouharak, that the landing of Turkish troops would not he permitted, and that any attempt to do so would be prevented hy force if necessary, I warned him accordingly that if he, or any other vessel or boat under his orders, attemptea to land armed forces at Koweit, to open fire on such vessels. 9. In reply the Turkish Captain said that the uhole country from Fas to Ba Turkish territory, the Sheikh t'oubarak was a Turkish subject and that there could tie no in- terference on the part of other nations with the affairs of Koweit. 10. I replied that I could nin to the political status of ■ tion for our respective Gov my structions were that the B the Sheikh of Koweit as being independent, and that the question immediately at issue was tee landing of Turkish forces at Koweit, which, as I had tola him, would not he permitted. He Turkish territory, and tha I nust carry out ny orders, he also had orders Mich he must carry out,11. T then asked him whether he intended to land any forces at Koweit, to which he replied in the negat ive, saying that he had no men to land , and that all he wanted to do was to speak to the Sheikh, He further informed me that he haa not been informed / before leaving Bussor ah / of the de cision of the British Government to support the independence of Sheikh -hibarak. 12, Raving re- iterated my instructions and again warned the Captain of the 'Zohaf' of the consequences attending any attempt to land men / on his part, B took my leave. The Captain of the 'Zohaf' throughout the interview was taciturn and disinclined to disclose any information as to his intentions or movements . 13. After leaving the 'Zohaf B landed to inter view the Sheikh ' 'ouharak, but found, that he was out in the country, and not expected back till the morning, B saiv,however, his eldest son the Sheikh Jabar, and told him what B had said to the Captain of the 'Zohaf', and requested him to keep me informed of his communications with the latter and00148 and especially of any attempt to land armed forces from the Zohaf during the night, 24, I then returned on hoard and as a thick mist had set in, concealing both the 'Zohaf' ana the shore from view, T weighed at 9.P.M.and groped my way with the lead round to Jladuba shoal, anchoring near 'Zohaf'. which vessel however J. even with the aid of the search- light , owing to the mist. In thick weather therefore ana during darkness, I must rely upon the Sheikh the -Zjohaf's' movements or 15. At daylight this morning the weather heme clea?iZ found the' Zohaf within 10 from this ship.I shifted berth to a distance of about 6 cables from her, and to position the outlying reefs allow for keeping her under observation. At 10 A .M. the Captain of the , Zohar landed and visited, the Sheikh Moubarak who immediately afterwaras se^ x the teat n e of what passea at the mm ei ■ ■ retain benan by attempting to cajole the Turkish Captain negan j 4- Turkey was Mahownedan the Sheikh, pointing out that lurhey w 'while Great Britain was Christian, the proximity of Mecca, and so on. The Sheikh replied that he now had British support ana aesired to have nothing further to do with Turkey, After further efforts at persuasion, the Turkish Captain declared his intention of remaining at Koweit , to which the Sheikh replied that he was at perfect llherty to remain as long as he liked, provided he aiu -:ot attempt to land men. The Turkish Captain then assumed a threatening tone, saia was going to remain at Koweit, orders to proceed to Katif and Bar-al-hatJ (co- pare this with his previous he was ordered to Koweit only) but that he woula now immediately return to and Turkish authorities of the state of affairs, and tha t he would come hack with two or three ships ana with troops to enforce Turkish authority. The Sheikh replied that he sail for Fao when he liked, that he (the ^,.t,ikh) h aa nothing more to do with the Turkish authority f ana referred them to the British Consul General. This terminated the interview ana the Sheikh immediatelyimmediately sent on hoard to inform me, 16. The British India steamer 'Kilwa' arrived this afternoon from Busra and sails this evening for Bushire, so that I take the opportunity of send ing this letter by her. I w 'Zohaf' under observation a My the first opportunity. I to have the 'Zohaf' watched when she sails to observe whether she goes North on♦VAX v.. A♦II I IJ tf, ANo. 213, dated Bushire, the 27th November 1901 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball , Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to report that His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah has forwarded to me, for disposal, a letter received by Mr. Lyle, Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company at Basrah, from Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, asking that the postal service may be extended to Koweit. Apart from the question whether the local receipts would be sufficient to cover the expenses of a Post Office at Koweit, I am doubtful if the measure would be considered advisable in view of the position of His Majesty's Govern ment with regard to Koweit. At present I understand that the British India Steam Navigation Company have decided to maintain a fortnightly service between Bombay and Koweit, but it appears to be uncertain whether they intend to do so permanently. Under the circumstances, I propose to reply to Sheikh Mubarak that the present time is not opportune for the consideration of the question of the establishment of a Post Office at Koweit; but, before I do so, I think it advisable to ascertain the views of the Government of India on the subject. &gt; n ■ j ACopy 00342 Fushire, My aear Captain Simons, Since writing my letter have received Mubarek's le November, which was brought over by the Sphinx but which I had to send into my Office to be translated. Mubarek ends this letter as follows:- ' If I see that you ao not check ana, prevent my enemies at such a juncture I will not be able to go against the Turkish Govt, and the only alternative will be for me to join them'. V/ill you kindly tell Mubarek that I have received his letter: further that the message which I ^conveyed to him in August seemed to vie to he an assurance of our assistance: that I have novj reported what he has told me to my Govt, and trust to he authorized to give him a more definite assurance . Meanwhile I can only counsel him to be patient and I fe^l sure that he will havehave no difficulty in returning an evasive reply tc the Nakib. It is of course most important that 1 should receive at once a copy of the message actually aeliverea to the Sheikh by the \ Nakib, If it is of the purport state a it is clear that the promise of the Turkish Government to respect the status quo is being broken ana our Government will undoubtedly make diplomatic protests to the Porte at once. They have probably a 1 ready a one so . I ao not see what more I can say. This should * probably satisfy the Sheikh, more especially as he will see from the continued presence of our ships at K that we ao not intend to leave him in the lurch. Yours sincerely, (Sa) C. A. Kemball, Vfr COPY confidential. Bushire, 5A2/1901, Dear Cart, Simons, Your letter of the 3rd was brought to me hv 'Redbreast 1 ' yesterday f with the letters from Sheikh Mubarek. i at o^ce telegraphed to the Govt, of India but up to the time of writing I have received no reply. The Viceroy is on tour, ana in any case the matter will have to he decided in London, so it seems to me to be very doubtful if a reply will be received today. I have therefore thouaht it lest to send Reo.hreasf- lack to you, with a letter to the Sheikh which I shall he 'lao. if you will read and hand to him . You will, I feel sure, anree that I can tell himit calls for an ivmeoiate reply arid the Sheika is perfectly justified in refusing to give a reply without ample time for deliheration. 1t must be purely a piece of 'bluff' on the hakib's part to c^emand ari immediate answer, ana it should be treated as such by the Sheikh , No harm, can be aone to the Sheikh by aela'&lt;. The Turks will never dream, of attacking Kowe it while our ships are there, and there can be little aoubt that the Porte has now been warned by the Ambassador that we shall use Naval Force to prevent an attack on Koweit . So Mubarek has every reason to feel secure, so far as his own. safety ana that of Kovjeit is concerned. I thoroughly understand his position ana what he wants from us , but I cannot on my own authority tell him any more than 1 have, I ao not clearly understand what you mean when you say that you may have to bombara Koweit. 1 take it that this is merely a ruse, to give Mubarek a reasonable excuse for refusing an immediate answer to the Nakib and that it will not be put into execution. It m r &gt;It will he a areat mistake to do anythina which would complicate the exist inn situation more thnrt it is at present. To my mind, there can he no maimer^ of doubt that the Sheikh can easily manage to put off the Nakib for some time longer. It seems to me that , so far as the question of our giving the Sheikh a more definite^ promise of protection goes, the Turks by their present action have playea into our hands r and that if the Sheikh remains patient and refuses to give an immediate reply he is hound to aet what he wants from, us. If however you were to carry your threat to homharc the place into execution , it would put us into a very awkward position , if the quest ion of the status of Kowei is ever referred to arbitration. It might give the Turks grounds for saying that we forced the Sheikh to accept English protection against his will, ana inaeed might he the cause of our having to submit the matter to arbitration &gt; which pro bably we do not wish to do at present. To sum up, I am. perfectly confident that Ifubarek can put off his reply to the Sultan's communi cationcomwimication fov so^ie time loiwev f that it is essentially to his oim intQ.yrst that he should do so and that it is unreasonable for him to give us what is practically an ultimatum that we must either nive him a definite protectorate within three aays or else he will no over to the Turks. It was, I understand at the Sheikh's own, suae est ion that you made the threat to use force to prevent him from givina a reply to the Nakib, ana. so far I think you -were justifiea in what you have cone, though I think it was quite unnecessary for the Sheikh to have requirec this of you. He could easily have otherwise evaded aivinn an answer to the If no ship of war is over here, when^the reply to mi) telearam comes, I will send the Lawrence Yours sincerely, (Sd) C.

Shaikh Mubārak's desire for Kuwait to formally be made a British Protectorate is discussed in detail.The file contains a number of reports (in their original Arabic with English translations attached) concerning political affairs in Kuwait that were written by Ali bin Ghulam Reza [‘Alī Ghulām Riḍā] , a news agent in Kuwait employed by the British.
