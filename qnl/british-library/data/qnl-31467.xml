It is desired, in the course of the next few months, to visit by air the various landing grounds on the Arabian Coast for which this Command is responsible. 2. The only one wnich presents any difficulty is that st SAUQRAH BAY, wnere tne inhabitants are reported to be wild and possibly hostile. The matter was recently put before Major Bremner, who recommended that the first landing by aircraft there should be carried out in the presence of Sheikh SAID bin Sultan of MAHUT who, he says, has great influence over these people. 3. It is however understood that communication with Sheikh SAID takes some three months, and it is, therefore pronosed that the visit should be postponed until November when the flight of four aircraft of No. to ADEN takes place. The flight is due to leave 1 IRAQ on the .18th. Noyejnber and will arrive over R ATT OR AH BAY two or‘three hours after daybreak on 'the 21st. November, having spent the night at MASIRAH ISLAND. instructions are being issued to the flight to land at SAJQRAH BAY, and it is hoped that you will oe able to arrange for Sheikh SAID to be present on tne date indicated. If the Sheikh and his party are not located, on the arrival of the flight, the flight will nevertheless land and leave again a-^most at once. 4 . it seems that tne only satisfactory means of ensuring that Sheikh SAID is at SAUQRAH BAY at the time required is to take him there from ;&lt;iAHUT in a sloop if one can be made available. To allow for the uncertainty of Arab movements and tne possibility of the Sheikh’s absence from MAHUT when required, in spit of previous warning, it is considered that at least a week should be allowed for the visit, commencing about the 14th. November. /5 Major Bremnera Pa^e* 2. 5. Major Bremner also suggested that SdeiWi SAID would require four or five followers to accompany hin to support nis prestige, and that SAIYID MAHMUD should represent the Sultan of Muscat. 6. Consideration has been given to the possibility of flying Sheikh SAID to SAUQRAH BAY by flying boat, but the proposal has been dropped owing to the difficulty in accommodating the Sheikh* s followers, and the complication of landing from a flying boat through the surf. 7. If these proposals are agreed to, and provided a sloop can be made available, it is requested that early arrangements may be made to ensure the presence of Sheikh SAID at the SAUQRAH BAY landing ground on some date before the 21st. November. 8. A letter is being despatched to the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian G-ulf informing him of this project, and asking whether a sloop can be detailed to assist.

'9M V., 7&gt; ^th March, 1936. H, 3. ;.vs CO^cL. OF. I am sending this letter by the Valentia, arriving at Muscat on March 14th, as it seems the quickest way of getting it to you. 2. Since seeing you, I have gone more fully into the question of landing grounds between MASIRAH ISLAND and MDRBAT and I have also had the opportunity of talking to the pilot who landed at KHOR GHARIM on 30.10.35. 3. With regard to KHOR GHARIM, the pilot reported to me that he stayed there an hour and saw no tribesman of any description. On the other hand, he felt that he was very lucky to get down without having his aeroplane damaged, and tells me that the sand drifts which we saw from the air are about eighteen inches in height. In view of this, I feel that it will be most injudicious to land aircraft at KHOR GHARIM until we have cleared the aerodrome and made it serviceable. A feature that affects the situation is that the monsoon is due to arrive next month and I understand that we shall not be able to make a landing from a boat on that coast until about the end of September. 1%, therefore, appears that the best procedure with regard to KHOR GHARIM will be to arrange with the S.N.O., P.G. for one of the sloops to visit there at the end of September, and to land a party to render the ground suitable for the landing of aircraft. You could, at the same time, take the Shaikh and fix up the political aspect of it. 4. With regard to the question of having ad ditional landing grounds between KHOR GHARIM and MURBAT, there are two areas v/hich will have to be reconnoitred - one near JA3IR, at the western end of SUKRA BAY, and a second in KHORYA MORYA BAY. I feel that we want to estab lish landing grounds at one or both of these places and the reconnaissance and establishment of these coulu be carried out at the same time as we clear up KHOR GHARIM. 5. While we are very much averse to leaving the situation as regards these landing grounds as it is at present, I don’t think, under the circumstances, that we have any alternative but to leave this matter over until the end of September. Perhaps you could, in the meantime, discuss the political aspect with the Sultan of Muscat so that that aspect of the problem could be dealt with by the time we want to take action. 6. With reference to our Signal A.350, dated March 7th, I hope the Sultan’s uncle will arrive at Salala, all right. ' ^ / J /L Cuu. tj Yours Y*iaj Major R.

VISIT TO SAUQRAH BAY. A f\ Air Headquarters, British Forces in ’Iraq, Hinaidi, 'Iraq. 17th August, 1936. Sir, I have the honour to refer to this Head quarters letter S/11030/D.0.. dated 22nd June, addressed to the Hon. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, a copy of which was forwarded to you. 2. A reply has now heen received from the R.P.G. authorising further arrangements concerning the visit to SAUQRAH BAY to be made direct with you. 3. The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, was sent a copy of our letter referred to above and has now replied (letter No. 116 of 14th July, 1936) to the effect that H.M.S. 'Deptford' will be available at MUSCAT on November 16th to carry out the reconnaissance etc. of SAUQRAH BAY. Before dealing with the detailed points raised by S.N.O.P.G. it would be appreciated if you would confirm that you .^re in agreement with the date now suggested by him;' and that you are able to make the necessary arrangements with the Shaikh of Kahut for the visit to SAUQRAH BAY, and for the work to proceed on arrival without a preliminary visit being made.' It is, of course, evident that on account of the distance only one visit should be made if possible 4. The enquiry made by S.N.O.P.G. in para. 2 of his letter that all or any of the party are to be accommodated ashore in tents whilst at KHOR GARIM or SAUQRAH BAY appears_jto call for your special comments, as on the last occasion When a similar visit was made to this part of the coast, the natives were not particularly friendly, consequently your suggestions whether all or any of the party mentioned in para. 6 of our letter S/11030/D.0^ of June 22nd should be accommodated ashore would be appreciated. 5 . A motor dhow with a 'houri' from MUSCAT has been hired by us on previous occasions for similar types of work. To effect the necessary arrangements, an officer has usually been sent down to MUSCAT, but as No. 203 (FB) Sauadron is not expected back in this command for possibly three weeks, it would be a very great convenience if you could possibly get the motor dhow and 'houri' reserved for us for this work from approximately November 4th to December 7th, subject of course to the negotiations in para. 3 above being satisfactory. 6 .

Sheikh Said when informed by the Wali that I was making enquiries about him sent his brother to Muscat but I was then absent at Gwadur.

INF ORM A T I 0 N 1* Serviceable emergency lai between MASIRAH ISLAND and MUR3A’ Serviceable emergency landing grounds are required That at K tT OR GHARUM was found last Autumn to be unfit for use owing to sand drifted over camel-thorn causing many small hummocks up to 1^ inches high along both the Dast and ^est sides of the landing crround end covering perhaps half of it. in addition, part of the circle and corner markings have been broken away and need repair. n 3* In addition to KHOR GHARUM, one or more landing grounds nearer MURBAT are also required. Air reconnaissances has revealed a likely site at JAZIR, at the Western end of SAUQRAH BAY, and there are also possible sites in KURIA MURlA BAY. 4. The previous reconnaissance which marked out KHOR GHARUM encountereu some signs of hostility from tne natives, and the damage to the landing ground markings seems to show tnat their attituue is still unfriendly. Aircraft which lanaeu at KHOR GHARUM were unable to establish contact with them. It is considered that if aircraft actually land in front of them in tne presence of their own paramount Sheikh, and if at tne same time we demonstrate that material benefits, m the form of payment for assistance ana small presents, are to be expected wnen aircraft land, anu that our only uesire is to be friendly, good relations will soon follow. /5. One of the5. One of the difficulties to be overcome is that of getting ashore. There is no sheltered water, and often considerable surf on the beach. It is most unlikely that anyone would be able to get ashore from flying boats on this stretch of coast. S.N.O.P.G. has therefore detailed H,M#3* 'DEPTFORD' to transport the reconnaissance party from MUSCAT and to form its headquarters. 6. P.A#&gt; MUSCAT, with an interpreter and a representative of the Sultan, will accompany the reconnaissance party from MUSCAT. Sheikh Said of MAHUT who has great influence over the inhabitants of this coast has been instructed to be ready to embark in H.M*3. 'DEPTFORD' at MAHUT by 10th November. He will be accompanied by^3 or 4 followers. INTENT ION. 7. (i) Tr make serviceable the landing ground at KFOR OHARUM. (ii) To locate, mark and level, if necessary, one or more new landing grounds between KHOR GHARUM and KURTUT. (iii) To estjblish friendly delations with the natives at each of these landing grounds and show them aircraft landing. EXE CUTI ON. Composition. 8. The following will take part in this reconnaissance:- (i) H*M.S. 'DEPTFORD' which will be at MUSCAT on 16th November. P,A.MUSCAT and interpreter, the Sultans representative, an Officer from Air Headquarters, the I.R.O. BASRA? 7orks and Buildings representative and 7//T Operator with pack set will embark in her there. (ii) A motor dhow carrying working party and materials and a 'hoori' for disembarking. P.A.MUSCAT is arranging for the hire of this dhow and 'hoori' from approximately 4th November to 7th December. The 7.&amp; B. representative is to arrange the working party and materials and to despatch them from IfUSCA' in the dhow in time to rendezvous with H.M.3. 'DEPTFORD' at MAHUT by 17th November.-3- (iii) One or more flying boats, according to the number available at the time, to be detailed by Officer Commanding, No*203 (P3) Squadron to reach MUSCAT on 16th November and then to proceed to MA3IHAH where they will be based for reconnaissance of landing ground sites. (iv) Three aircraft of No.55 (B) Squadron. These to be three of those proceeding to ADEN which are due back at MASIRAK on 29th November. These three will remain based at MASIKAH and carry out landings at KHOR GHARUM and the new landing grounds. Command. 9* An Officer from Air Headquarters, who will be accommodated in H.M.S. ’'DEPTPQRD”, will direct the operations in consultation with the Captain of H*M#3# H DEPTFORD' and P.A. MUSCAT. He will issue instructions to the aircraft of Nos. 55 and 203 Squadrons by 7/T or other means, and will decide on the sites of landing grounds and the work to be done in consultation with the and B. representative. Rendezvous. 10. The initial rendezvous will be at MUSCAT on 16th November, 1936. The Staff Officer, I.R.O* BASRA and 7/T operator will proceed there in one of the flying boats. The second rendezvous will be at MAHUT where H.M.S. ' , DEPTFORD M , on her arrival on 17th or IQth November, embarks Sheikh Said. The dhow with the working party is also to be there then. A flying boat from MASIRAH will be instructed by W/T to land alongside H.M.S.’'DEPTFORD’ 1 soon after her arrival. Further instructions will then be issued. i: he ^oration of tne reconnaissance cannot be definitely foreseen, bat two weeks or more may be required. ADMINI STRAT IVE ARRANGEMENTS. 11. u wing to the limited accommodation in H.M.S.'DEPTFORD' and possible difficulties in getting ashore and re-embarking, those taking part in the reconnaissance should live ashore as far as possible. 12. P.A. MUSCAT will provide tents for himself and his interpreter, the Sultan's representative and Sheikh Said and his followers.13. The ^• and B.representative is to provide tentage and messing arrangements to be carried in the dhow for himself, I.R.O. BASRA ana the Staff Officer of Air Headquarters, and also for the coolies. 14.

Considerable difficulty is involved in transferring fuel from one store to the other, so that flying boats cannot readily obtain fuel from the landing ground and vice versa. 16.

Unfortunately the Muscat Government without stating any reasons declared that they were unable to comply with my request. A report on this subject xo being submitted separately. 3 . H.M.3. 'Ueptford' arrived at Muscat on 16tn November and sailed the same evening with the following persons on board; dquadronSquadron/Leader Nicoletts, Hoyal Air Force Officer, Air Force Headquarters, Hinaidi, Lieut. Hasler, H«L«, Attached Works and Building, Boyal Air Force, The Political Agent, The Agency Interpreter and Wali kuddafar, the Hepresentative of the Muscat Government. A dhow containing some £5 coolies and material for the repair and construction of the Landing grounds was taken in tow. 'Deptford' arrived off Bur on the morning of 17th and took on board Bheikh Salim head of the Fuwaris, a sub section of the Jenabeh tribe inhabiting sauqrah Bay district and, Sheikh flasir, a petty sheikh of the Arama section of the Jenabeh tribe but reported to have considerable influence amongst the local tribesmen, together with six of their respective followers. The presence of these two Sheikhs with the expedition was considered by the Muscat Government to be essential should it have been impossible to obtain the services of Sheikh Said the paramount chief of the tribes of the areas to be visited vide my telegram No. 93 of loth November 1936. 5 . On arrival at Mahut on November 18th it was found that Sheikh Said was present and he was accorduJ^T embarked in 'Deptford' accompanied by his two sons and four followers. According to Sheikh Said's statement e letter which the Sultan's Representative had promised , send off in August (vide my letter No. S/24 of 36th iptember 1936) instructing him to be present at Mahut i 10th November to join the expedition had never (ached him and he was about to leave on a trip into the iterior when the second letter obtained from the Muscat * October and sent by special messenger fromfrom ^ur 9 arrived 6 # tJiur unarim was reached on the morning of the 19th and the ^iheikhs and their followers were first landed to get into touch with the local tribesmen* a few fisher men and herdsmen were met who showed themselves quite friendly so the coolies and stores were disembarked and a camp pitched near the snore, during the next and following days numbers of the local inhabitants visited the camp though they were never more than 60 - 60 present at any one time* These were all of the •Jenabeh tribe and at no time wftll'there the least signs of hostility* Visitors to the camp were given food and excellent relations maintained throughout our stay* Commander Bowlby kindly allowed the Surgeon of the 'Deptford ' 1 to treat a number of sick persons &lt; of the tribes people and this action contributed in no small degree to maintain and increase the friendly atmosphere 7* The handing grounu which is situated some three quarters of a mile from the snore was found to require a good deal of work in levelling and removing stunted scrub and numerous small sand drifts which had become piled up on it. The damage to the markings on the ground was seen to have been comparatively ^) and mostly confined to one ol the corner angles which had been completely broken up* 8 . a Flying Boat from bOo dquadron arrived on the 19 th Bov ember from Muscat bringing mail anu fresh provisions for the 'j^eptford'* Squadron Leader Uicoletts left in it the same day to carry out an aerial reconnaissance of the Coast to the Louth with a view to selecting two new Landing Grounds* After proceeding for refuelling to Murbat 9 where the night was spent aboard the Jlying doat^ returned on £lst having discovered two promising sites at a distance of 66 and 116 miles respectively from Mhor Gharim. The Flying Boat left for Muscat the same after noon*9* By this time all repairs to the markings had been completed and only a small amount of work remained to be done on the surface of the ground. As every day, however, was of importance in view of the limited time for which the £loop and the Flying Boats could be retained on the operations it was decided to leave three coolies in the camp to proceed with the clearing up work until our return and thus avoid any waste of time, oheikh ^aiu under took full responsibility for the safety of the coolies ana left two of his own followers as a precautionary measure. In view of the excellent relations which had been establish ed and maintained with the local inhabitants I aid not consider that there was any risk in leaving the men for a short time. No difficulty was experienced in obtaining three volunteers for the purpose from the party of coolies. 10 . M jjeptford M accordingly sailed on B 2 na November to the southward and on 23rd anchored some 4 miles distant 6HAW/ ^ qi m from the shore opposite to khur tihrnrim in Latitude 18 » 56° 38 £ at which point the first of the two likely Landing grounds had been seen from the air by squadron Leader Nicoletts as mentioned in the paragraph 9. on approaching the shore it was found that the water shoaled rapidly and a distance of a mile and a half was the nearest it would have been possible to bring the dhow with its load of necessary materials. The site of the proposed Landing ^ ground on examination was found, I understand, to be moderately suitable for the purpose though a good deal oi work apparently would have been required in levelling ana removing sana and scrub. The deciding factor however was the long distance from shore at which tne aloop ana the dhow would have to lie which would have considerably prolonged operations. As time was limited it was therefore decidedm 5 decided by Squadron Leader Nicoletts to abandon the idea of malting a Landing ground at this spot. Only one of the local inhabitants was met with here and this individual proved himself friendly even jocular. The second site in Kuria Muria Bay in a 11 district named SHUWAIMIYA was reached on the morning of 24th November and anchor dropped in Latitude 17° £6 N Longitude 56° 39 i; a bare half mile from a sandy beach. On proceeding ashore an almost ideal Landing ground was found immediately opposite the ship and about one mile from the sea, with a firm surface and requiring only a small amount of work to prepare it for use. Coolies, stores, Bheiks and their followers were landed the same day and work on the markings etc. commenced. A party of some half dozen of the local inhabitants soon appeared who apparently live in caves and reed huts scattered at intervals in the neighbourhood. They were perfectly friendly but appeared to be throughly poverty stricken and ill nourished and their chief desire was to be given food especially rice which was freely distributed to all who visited the camp during our stay at this spot. A number of tribes from Lhofar, the borders of which are only a few miles distant, are frequent visitors to this district and these people are easily distinguished by their darker complexions and shaggy head of hair from the true Arab type. The actual tribe inhabiting this area is known as the BATAHIRAH anu would appear to be of mixed Dhofar and Arab origin. Though not belonging to the large Jenabeh tribe of which Bheikh Said ie the paramount Chief, the Batahirah owe allegiance to them and it was noticed were obedient to him. All thoseevery way and those we met were pleasanter to deal with in more amenable that the tribes of i^auqrah Bay. 13. As at Khar Gharlm the Burgeon of the rt Beptford rt went ashore on several occasions and treated numbers of the local people for the usual complaints founa in these parts, eye disease being the most prevalent. The welcome news of free medicine and treatment at the hands of a European doctor soon spread around and during our stay at Bhawaimiya after the first few days seldom less than B0-30 men, women and children, generally more,were present daily in camp some for medical treatment and free food, others as spectators at some of the minor operations performed which for the averag inhabitant of those parts must have been an intensely entertaining spectacle. 14. The political situation here being so eminently satisfactory in every way Commander Bowlbey kindly agreed to pay a flying visit to Salalah which was distant only a little over 12 hours steaming to enable me to have an interview with the Sultan whom 1 had not seen or being able to get in touch with since *pril last. The sheikhs and their followers were left in charge of the camp and coolies, except Bhelkh Bald and Bheikh ftasir of Bur who suddenly declared their desire to see the Bultan and askeu to oe allowed to accompany us. Bheikh Bald had appeared doubt ful whether we were making the new Landing ground with the knowledge and consent of the Bult&amp;n in spite of the letter he had received from the latter*s Kepresentative, ^aiyid Bhahab, I agreed to take them both to make certain this point was satisfactorily settled for him. 15. On 28th November ’‘Deptford' proceeded first 1,0 the lee of Hallaniya the largest of the Kuria Muria Islands where a rendezvous had been arranged for the next visit of the Flying Boat from Muscat. The almost continuous swell-7- i off iihawalmiya made it doubtful whether such craft could alight there and especially get off with any degree of certainty. boon after the anchor had been dropped close to th eastern side of the island the son of the headman, who himself was sicic, with 4-5 followers came on board. Their chief need seemed to be food so bread, tinned fruit, cigarettes and as much rice as could be spared from the limited quantity available were given them. Later in the day accompanied by one of the ship^ off ice r51 visited the solitary village of the island which consisted of a group of rough stone and reed huts, the surrounding ground being covered with an incredible quantity of fish bones. The total population of the island is stated to be some 50 souls. Those met with were all very friendly but had an ill nourished and dejected looking appearance. Most of them are said to have been born on the island though originally coming from Murbat with which place they maintain connection. They appeared surprised when infomed the islands were a British possession. Fishing is evidently the only occupation ; there being so far as could be seen^not a blade of vegetation anywhere. 16. The Flying Boat having been delayed en route had been unable to make KALL/^IYA in time and in consequence had proceeded direct to kurbat whither “Deptford” accordingly sailed and reached on 29th. niter receiving mails and provisions we left for balalah where we arrived about 10 A.M. The bultan fortunately was at home ana I went ashore shortly after and remained talking over various matters with him until nearly sunset. I am submitting separate reports under their respective heads concerning the different subjects discussed at this interview.Usaaiandar Bowlby ami iquadjnm Leader llicole^ts paid a bria^^omciaX c&amp;XX on tho jult^n during t»h« aftamoon# ^hailcha ^aid and tiinir alao had a briar interviaw with ills iii^hnaaa and whiit th« fomar 1 s pratandad KAxiaty to obtain cosirirEiation of th% &lt;iuXtan , 6 approval of tha making of the new landing ground at dhuwaiaiiy&amp; waa as-tiafactorily aattXadi gift liar roauXts apparantiy did not attajad tha raaX object of thalr wis/* to accoiipany ua to dalal&amp;h &lt;hich was to ax tract a h^ndsoisa caa 2 i present from their ihiler* On ra-ijabrirteing in 'Daptfora* the aamt evening both dhelkh* were evidently diagruntlad and X aaoartainad afterwards that the xiet result of uieir efforts to obtain X^ea^a waa the gift of a orlnx at auneat of the mlllc of half a cocoanut each.

Un the 6 th the two ^ur sheikhs were disembaraed at that port and on the morning of the 7th Unseat was reached and the expedition came to an end* 13* VJLx,. Ihe results of Uxe expedition may, X think, be considered to have been successful* ihe old Landing Ground at khor Gharim was repaired and put into serviceable condition and an excellent new t*anain&amp; Ground found ana made at a convenient distance between tn&amp;t place and xurbat and, what from the political point of view is oi the utmost importance, contact made and frienaly relations established with the local inhabitants at the two places concerned and with the paramount Jheikh of all the tribes in the districts not only by the Political Agency but by the havy and uoyal Air Force as well* xt the termination of the expedition to ahor Gharim in 1934 an error I think was made in not making some agreement for an annual payment for tne rent and maintenance of the Landing Ground* X found both on the part of sheikh baid and also on that of the tribesmen on the spot a sense of grievance that they had received nothin &gt;.. uio.1 Though the ground occupied is purely waste land the tri.^s people/ (j|3 pcopit consider, with what X think mm Justification, that it is oitor all theirs ana sumo thin* should he given the* for its use. for this reason 1 re^uesteu .au uaai'on ~ea«ier \icoletts to obtain sanction lor an annual payment or as. 100/- for each of the haauing grounds. Two suitable agretinentc were conciudea with sheikh daid. ine originals have been kept in the -agency Office «*»-a translation) of which ±9 attached to ^his report. !$*• it will be seen from the agreements that sheikh ^id as the paramount sheikh of the tribes concerned accepts responsibility for the preservation of the Grounds. I am afTuid that too much stress must not^be placed on this acceptance, sheikh *&amp;iu has considerable over v&gt;e tribes, he is about the only person who has. He cannot however be said to have any great control emfrftheou X think t however t that there is now good reason to believe that as a result of the frienoly relations established on this expedition arm* agreement for the future payments of a regular sum as rent (a portion at least of which will find its way into the hands of the local tribesmen; that the markings am ground will be left undamagi ed and aircraft when alighting will be well received. 20 . Xt has been ascertained that the damage to the markings at ohor Gharim was commit tea by one individual now hiding in the dman 9 whose Identity is known. Xt seems that this man who belongs to a section of the Jenabeh uribe which only occasionally visits this dlstrlct 9 considered that he did not get &amp; proper share of the money dlatrlbutea when the Ground was first made in 1234 and did this mischief according to the typical Arab tribesman's method, in ih« hope of getting the rest of tne tribe into trouble* in wild and lawless parts this sort of thing is of cour se almost itiposaible to prevent from happening occasionally but now that oheikh oaid has agreed to accept responsibility in-u- in rtturn for r^ular payment a I truet that Uiar« will be no more Incidents of this nature. if any dwaagt is found in the future to have been done to the grounds payaenta of rent should of course be suspended pending enquiries. In this connection I would suggest that in the j uturc when visits arc made to these handing urounds by rtoyal hir Korea machines that no money or other presents be given to any locals who may be met with. 1 would however recommend that a small quantity of the usual tvue of medicinee be carried on such occasions for distribution. 21# The amount of money expended during the course of the expedition in the form of cash payments v presentS| cost of food etc is shown in the appendix attached. I much regret that It was found necessary to exceed the amount of 4 1000 /- originally applied for and sanctioned by you vide your telegram ho. of November 15th and 1 trust you will approve of my action. 1 made every possible effort to keep the expenditure as low as possible but in view of the scale at which payments were previously made for this purpose I did not consider it advisable to risk antagonising anyone and so perhaps ruining the whole expedition for the sake of a few hundred rupees. It appears from the ofx'lce recorus that on the first expedition to dauqrah Bay in 1932 at which one Landing Ground was made some / 1400/** idollars) were spent while on this last expedition in addition to the new Landing Ground made at dhuwalmlya the situation at ahor Gharlm was such that the various difficulties to be over come from the political point of view amounted to arriving tor a new Ground.

Nominwlly under hultaa /' 'ultan of Xuacat it la In fact un^er no authority anatarer except that of the local : haiicha, wh&gt;»e tribesmen are more than ordinarily wild, suspicious and jealous of tnelr independence. Hefore the reoonnaissanoe could be uno ertuKeu contact had to be oaade with the-e ihnlkha, in itself by no means an et^ey mutter, and even when this was effected and the reoonnaiasance party - with the ahaifcfcs - had arrived at fU»uqrah Bay, it *»ili oe seen f r;» (aj or Hre iner's report (paragraphs il, 13, 14 and 18) that tne attitude of the tribesmen was at times distinctly uncompromising. 3. On this occasion the ground nad been broken by the previous reconnaissance, and no hostility was shown by the local tribes, whose attitude was neutral at auqrah Bay, and friendly at Khor Oharim. The only disgruntled individuals were t vo Shaikhs who visited their liege lord the ultan of ruacat, at Salalah, (vide paragraph 16 of ajor iatts* letter), hoping for handsome cash presents, and who *er« rewarded at sunset (it was amasan) by a drink of the milk of half a cocoanut each. As Sfaj ar *tto remains, oocoanuts n e cheap at Salalah. 4. The fact, hswevsr, that the reconm-iasance was carried out without incident in no way detracts from the creo it due to Major mitts for its successful conclusion. There is an excei^snt sayIn^ that “the bad travsllsr carries his adventures with hlm ,, , and Mnj o. 'atts carried none with him on this occasion.

A i r Ministry rely on using this route as part of their reinforcement plan and the numbers of aircraft which it is now visualised might have to pass along it are very much more than those for which the fuel quantities were originally calculated. In addition some of the squadrons which might have to use the route are equipped with aircraft which could not safely complete the stage between mASIRAH and MBRBAT without intermediate refuelling. In order {•to fulfil the Air Ministry requirements it will be necessary for me to put the following proposals into effect:- [ i) Stock the fuel store at MASIRAh to full capacity. [ii) Build and stock a small fuel store at ShUWAMl¥Ah. (iii) Increase the fuel stocks at mERBaT. 4. In regard to the erection of the fuel store at 3HU,7AMIYAH, this will require an expedition organised on similar lines to the one last year when the landing ground was -/ constructed ble the political Resident in the Persian culf, BUS HIRE. 1 *’ the . J .u i t leal Aes i Jentconstructed. In, view of tne surf wnicn bests on tnis coast during the south-west gionsoonit is essential that this expedition is completed during the next two or three months and I am asking the Senior aaval officer of tne Persian uulf if he can provide a sloop to tow a dhow containing tne necessary materials and coolies from Muscat as soon as it can be got ready. I also hope that the Senior naval ufficer will allow the sloop to remain at 3nu'/AMIYAH during the construct ion and tne stocking of tne store. before going ahead with the arrangements I should appreciate it if you would confirm that there are no objections from the political standpoint.. I presume that it would be necessary for a representative of the Muscat Government to accompany the party but l sincerely hope that the delays which occurred in preparing for last year's expedition will not happen tnis time since the Air Ministry attach very great urgency to tne establishment of this fuel store. 5. For the present I propose to increase tne fuel stocks at MERBAT to 15,500 gallons. 1 have been in corres pondence with the Political Agent, Muscat with regard to tne possibility of constructing a petrol store at dALALA which is a much better place than mEHBAT in every way. I understand that work on this store can be started at any time and when it is completed I propose to maxe this the main refuelling halt in place of MERBAT. Fuel will still continue to be kept at MERBaT for the use of flying boats only. I have the honour to be, Gir, lour obedient Servant Sd.

Political Agency &amp; 4 UM 1 s Consulate, Muscat, the April, 1938. From To Major H.F. Watts, I.A., Political Agent &amp; H.M’s Consul, Muscat. The Hon’ble t^e Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire• Expedition to build petrol store at Shuwaimiyah. Sir, X have the honour to submit herewith a report on the combined Kaval, Air Force and political expedition to Shuwaimiyah. The purpose of the expedition was to build a petrol store at Shuwaimiyah on tbe emergency landing ground at that i^laoe which had been made by a similar expedition which took place in November i936. 2. The date originally fixed for the start of the expedition from Kusoat was March lOth but owing to certain unforeseen urgent politi.al matters unconnected with the actual expedition the departure had to be delayed until the eyening of 13th March, on that date H.M.S. Deptford which, as for last year-s expedition, had been detailed as the escort sloop, sailed with the following persons on boardi- hieutenant J.H. Becher, R.A.7., Air Stafi Head quarters Dhibban, liaison Officer, Mr. R.O. Reid of the yorks and Buildings Depart- ment of the Air jii.iistry, who waswho was in actual charge of the building operations. Major R.p. Watts, Political Agent, Muscat, and Shaikh Salim bin Humaid the Representative of the Muscat Government* A large dhow, procured with some difficulty since such vessels are rarely available for hire at short noticei which carried various material required for the construction of the store and some seventy five coolies recruited locally, was taken in tow by Deptford, 3* Un March 16th Mahut, a small fishing port situated nearly opposite the southern extremity of Masirah Island was reached and 1 went ashore with the object of seeing bhaikh Said bin Sultan, the paramount chief of ^ most of the tribes in habiting the coastal belt between Masirah island and the &amp; Shuwaimiyah district and whose headquarters are at Mahut, The Shaikh, however, had left a short time previously for the Hadhramaut, 4, On March 19th Shuwaimiyah was reached and the work of disembarking coolies and stores started immediately. A few of the local inhabitants who happened to be present were friend ±y and oifere^ no objection to the landing. Fortunately suit able stone for quarrying for the walls of the petrol shed was found within a few yards of the edge of the landing ground and this fact contributed in pto small measure to it being possible to complete the building within the short available period of three weeks allowed for the work. 5 # on 2ist an individual named Muhammad bin Sulaiyim appeared, who claimed to be the Shaikh of the local tribe in habiting the district, he stated that his tribe who are known as the Batahrah, are a branch of the Jenabah of which Shaikh Said bin Sultan is the paramount chief but declared that his ^articularparticular section had always been independent and had nercr been in any way under that person's control or authority. The Sultan had sometime previously informed me in the course of conversation that the claim of Said bin Sultan to be the paramount chief of the tribes inhabiting the coastal regions inclusive of Shuwaimiyah was so far as that place was concerned incorrect, although the .Muscat Government had, on both the 1934 and 1936 expeditions to these parts, acknowledged his control of all the district bordering the sea between Masirah island and the northern limits of the province of Dhofar. The explanation of this confusion is of course that the Jauscat authorities have little .Knowledge of conditions prevailing in those numerous portions of their territory over which they have no effective control. 6. Since it was clearly important to ascertain who in reality was the Shaikh of the Shuwaimiyah district 1 had arranged with the Sultan’s Representative previous to the start of the expedition that an official of the Dhofar administration should be picked up there and taken to Shuwaimiyah to endeavour to establish his identity. Taking advantage of the presence of two Vincent aircraft, which under similar arrangements to those made on the 1936 expedition to i&lt;hor Gharim and Shuwaimiyah had . provisions been detailed to convey mails and fresh jzxxA&amp;xjuix from Jiuscat, 1 proceeded to Salal&amp;h on 27th llarch by Air accompanied by Lieutenant Lecher, R.A.F. It was arranged with the iali of Dhofar to whom 1 had brought a letter for this purpose from the Sultan's Representative and who was stated to have had extensive knowledge of the district and tribes we v/ere dealing with, that a certain State official named Ali Assiyabi should be sent to aurbat and thence taken by Deptford to Snuvvaimiyah on her coming visit to that port to transport petrol and oix to stock the new storage shed. f lhile at Salalah the new petrol store under cons truction by the Muscat State authorities for the use oi the Royal(16S) Royal Air Joroe was inspected and found to be practically completed and apparently *ell constructed, it was explained to tiI0 of:f loiai entrusted with tlie work - Haji Zubair, formerly uead of the Muscat Legal Administration - whr.t v.ere tne extra dimensions necessary for the increased capacity of the store as had been recently decided upon by Air Headquarters Iraq and arrangements made for the necessary additions to be made for this purpose to the building. A full report on this matter is f i understand, bein b submitted by Lieutenant Lecher to Air Headquarters at Dhibban* Lieutenant Becher and i returned to Shuwaimiyah the same day # ^* A® tiie political situation at Shuwaimiyah had from tLe beginning been quiet and satisfactory and tne work on the petrol store had advanced to a stage which allowed Mr.Keid to leave it to be proceeded with by the workmen, Deptford sailed on 28th for Murbat which was reached the next day. After loading 600 odd tins of petrol and taxen on board Ali as Siyabi the Dhofar official referred to in paragraph 6 above Deptford left Murbat on 2Vth March and returned once more to Shuwaimiyah on 30th. Muhammad bin Sulaiyim the alleged chief of the LataLrah tribe who had left Shuwaimiyah on private affairs for a few days shortly afterwards reappeared on the scene and was at once recognised by the Dhofar official as being in reality the Shaiidi of the i’ribe. It was also corroborated by that official that tne Batahrah are not under the control or autnority of Shai^n Said bin Suxtan vide paragraph 5 supra. Discussions were accordingly started with Muhammad bin Sulaiyim for an agreement for the rent of the landing ground and custody of the petrol store. After the usual haggling an agreement was made and signed under which in return for a yearly payment of $ 120 per annum the Shaikh A agreed toagreed to look after the landing ground markings and the petrol store with its contents situated thereon. A copy of this agreement is attached as an appendix to this report. When the landing ground was constructed in i936 an agreement was made for payment of £ 100 per annum for the rent of the ground alone, Tide my letter ho. 104 dated 15th December 1936. A plJfrol store has now been constructed and stocked with fuel so 1 think that an additional sum of only 0 20 per annum for the custody of the building is quite a reasonable one to pay. 9 it should be realised, however, that though the words H care and safe cu8tody n are used in the agreement it is not practical to apply trie proper sense of them too literally in this connection. Bhuwaimiyah is one of the many wild and lawless districts Ol the Muscat State where the Sultan’s Governiijent has little or no authority. This neighbourhood is fer most of the surmer months reported to be .eserted. During the winter small parties of the batahrah tribe are usually to be found living in oaves in the vicinity of the landing ground. Their principal occupation there is fishing partially for food but chiefly for export from Jlurbat and Sur via Macirah. in addition to tue seasonal visits of the local tribesmen the Shuw&amp;imiyah district is traversed by odd travellers on the overland route between Dhofar and the southern portions of Oman and bur. Money paid to local Shaikhs or their followers for so called rent of pieces of worthless desert wasteland is / of course, nothing more than a form of bribery and the most that can be hoped for is that deliberate damage to the landing ground^ markings and any building thereon wixi be thusthus avoided. ^■n i n\ 10 . ;he sHaikh of Sha.aimiyah ... clamouring for .ome Money for Hima.lf and Ms foUow.r. and the nation had to be decided aino. It waa .Yld.nt tfaat diaastroua re.ulta .ouid follow failure to mke anrn^ vo nBice gome sort of payment, what form this should take. Jiy first inclination was to pay the Shaikh the * 100 due for the rent of th. landing ground agreed upon in 1936 between r.halkh aald bin Sultan and myaelf and not hitherto paid to that indiridual partially beaauae he had been apparently ton* too la«y to come to the Agency and claim i t and also becauae in the conrersation I had on the subject with the oultan referred to in paragraph 5 above Hie Highness had expressly requested me not to pay the Shaish. In accordance witi, your instructions given to me when in Muscat in February I had been prepared to give the rent for last year to Shaikh Said bin Sultan as a safeguard against possible future mischief on his pa&amp;t should he press strongly for it when 1 went to see him at his headquarters at aahut on my way down to Shuwaimiyah. however,as has been already mentioned. Shaikh S a id was not at Mahut when 1 called. X then decided that should subsequent events indicate the advisibillty of paying some sum of money to Shaikh 5aid to 'buy hi|s| off' it would be useful to have the amount of last /ear* s rent in hand for the purpose. / Accordingly in the agreement 1 made with the Shaikh of Shuwaimiyah twhich i should mention was approved of by Air Force Headquarters vide their telegram Ho. A385 dated 6th April 1V38 to Lieutenant Heoher, K.A.F.j the payment of the sum of $ 120 was laid down as being the rent for the ground and safe custody of the markings and petrol store thereon for twelve months in advance to take effect from the date I of signature i.e. 1st April j.938* \ 11. In addition to the payment of ^ 120 as one year's/£ '2- rent in adr^noe certain other expenses haa to be inc i for the ^olitioax sucoese of the expedition. Details of expenditure* which i made every effort to xee* aa low as ^osoihle and which I do not think is unreasonable, will be found in A^endix B of the report and will i trust be approved of. It will be seen that a total of Si 4i5/- in clusive of the year's rent paid in advance were spent and l presume, that as in the ease of the 1936 expedition to Khur Gharim and Shuwaimiyah this amount will be borne by Air ?oroe Headquarters Iraq. 12. The petrol store was completed on April 4th and the e xpedition broke up on that date, Deptford sailing for iiuscat with the dhow ana coolies in tow and Lieutenant J.H. Becher, H.A.F,, ana myself returning in two vincerts by air. Deptford reached Husoat on April Lth having been delayed a day en route through having to turn baox to Maairaii laiand and stand by to be of help if required to a Flying Boat of Bo. 203 Squadron which had sustained damage j when taking off from the anchorage of that island. * Ike result of toe expedition may X think oe considered satisfactory.

I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with Air Ministry signal X.842 dated 22nd December, 1937, with regard to the construction of a fuel store at the emergency landing ground at SHUWAMIYAH the South Arabian c oast• 2, As a result of recent Air Ministry policy, the South Arabian route may be used for reinforcement on a much bigger scale than had been visualised hitherto. In addition, some of the suqadrons which might have to use the route are equipped with aircraft which could not safely complete the stage between MAS I RAH and MERBAT without intermediate refuelling, which would have necessitated the accompanying Valentias going on to MERBAT and returning with sufficient fuel to top up these aircraft at an intermediate landing ground, a method which could not be considered satisfactory. To meet the requirements along this route it was necessary to build, and stock, a small fuel store at SHUWAMIYAH. The stock was taken from MERBAT by the expedition building the store. 3. SHUWAMIYAH is situated on the very' exposed part of the South Arabian coast some 300 miles South of MUSCAT. The heavy surf on the foreshore along this coast makes it difficult to stock the fuel store. Organisation of Expedition . 4. As no local labour is available at SHUWAMIYAH to build The Under Secretary of State, Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsw&amp;y, W.G.2. Copy to:-Hon*ble Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

I therefore communicated with the Hon* fcle Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, in order that the former might take any political action he considered necessary, and that the latter might detail a Sloop to assist in the operations. The Hon’fcle Political Resident in the Persian Gulf appointed Maj or R .P. Watts , I.A., the Political Agent at MUSCAT, to accompany the expedition and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf detailed H.M.S. ”Deptford'* to convey the party to SHUWAMIYAH. 5. The date originally fixed for the start of the expedition from MUSCAT was 10th March but owing to certain unforeseen political matters unconnected with the actual expedition, the departure had to be delayed until the 13th March. Difficulty was also encountered in view of the limited number of suitable dhows available at MUSCAT; but it was finally agreed to hire a dhow of 70 tons capacity tor Rs.800/- for a period of 28 days. In view of the quantity of stores and water to be carried between the dhow, the Sloop, and the shore, at SHU-VAMIYAH two houris (native boats) with crews of three for each were engaged by the Political Agent. Ou tward Jo urn ey . 6. The expedition, which consisted of Major R.P.Vatts, I.A. (Political Agent, Muscat), Plight Lieutenant Becher (Air Headquarters), Mr. R.G.Reid (a.M.W.D.), and Shaikh Bin Humaid ( a representative of the Muscat Government) left MUSCAT in H.M.S. 'Deptford' on the evening of the 13th March, taking in/3 in tow the hired dhow containing the building materials for the construction of* the fuel store. Calm seas prevailed and the tow proceeded satisfactorily until the 14th March when rough seas were encountered. On two occasions during the journey to Shuwamiyah| the tow-line parted. Shuwamiyah was reached on the lath March; and the work of disembarkating coolies and stores started immediately. The surf for the first few days hampered, but did not prevent, the landing of stores. It varied throughout the stay from negligible to sufficiently heavy to prevent the land- -ing of heavily loaded boats. The two houris which were brought from Muscat proved to be the only boats that could live in the surf. All materials and a daily supply of water for fixing the cement had to be carried by coolies to the site, about a mile inland, as no other msaasof transport was available. Siting and building of fuel store. 7. A site for the fuel store was selected by the Works Officer and Flight Lieutenant Becher at the South-East corner of the landing ground, about 50 feet outside the corner marking, with the door to the North so that aircraft would be able to taxi right up to it. Stone was quarried by wedges and bars from extensive outcrops of rock within 400 yards of the site. Blown sand was available in the proximity and there was an abundance of mixed sand and gravel on the site. The foundations were taken down to rock at an average depth of one foot and the trench was filled with concrete The/4 The walls were constructed of coursed rubble masonry with hammer dressed face and squared quoins in cement mortar. The whole of the exterior of the building was liberally lime-washed. The steelwork was given two coats of bituminous paint. The store was com- -pleted on the 3rd April, 1938. Stocking of fuel store. 8. As the political situation at Shuwamiyah was quiet and satisfactory, it was possible for H.M.S. 'Deptford' to leave on the 2bth March for Merfcat, some 100 miles, taking the dhow in tow to obtain fuel to stock the new store. They ariiived at Merbat on the 29th March, where the two houris were employed in carrying the petrol and oil to the dhow. The party left Merbat on the 29th and arrived back at Shuwamiyah on the 30th. On the 4th April, the store was stocked with 2)500 gallons D.T.D. 230 and 125 gallons oil S.G. Political. 9. Some difficulty was experienced in ascertaining who was the paramount chief of the Shuwamiyah district. It had been acknowledge by the Muscat Government on both the 1934 and 1935 expeditions that the paramount chief was Said bin Sultan, but there was some doubt as to whether his control actually extended as far as Shuwamiyah. During the period of the construction of the fuel store an individual named Muhammad bin Sulaiyim presented himself and claimed that he was the Shaikh of the local tribe inhabiting the district. He stated that/-5 (71 ds that his tribe, who are known as the Batahrah, are a branch of the Jenebeh of which Shaikh Said bin Sultan is the paramount chief, but declared that his particular section had always been independent and had never been in any way under that person's control or authority. In order to ascertain who in reality was the Shaikh of Shuwamiyan, the Political Agent (Major K.r.Viatts) and Flignt Lieutenant Becner went by air t,o Saiaia on tne 27th March where it v*as arranged with the Vran or bhofar for a State official to be sent to Merbat, and thence tajten oy h.M.S.Deptioro to Shuwamiyah in order that he might establish the identity ox the local SnaiKh. Muhammad bin Suiaiyun was absent on private arxairs when the Dhoxar omcial arrived, out on his return was immediately recognised by him as oemg in reality the bnaiitn 01 one urioe. it was also comirmeo that tne batahrah trioe are noo under one control or the authority ox Shaikh Said om Suttcm. iQ. Discussions were accordingly started witn one Snajui as to the amount to be paid in rent xor one xuikn*.ng ground and new fuel store. Agreement was event- -ually made, and signed, by which in return for a yearly payment of % 120 the Shaikh agreed to look after the landing ground and fuel store. A copy of the agreement is attached hereto together with a detailed list of expenditure incurred in connection with this expedition. Air Co-operation. 11. It had been arranged that H.M.S.Deptford should be kept supplied throughout the pexi od every week/week with fresh vegetables and mail from Muscat by aircraft* Two Vincents of JNo*55(B) Squadron were detailed lor this duty* Very heavy calls were made on the aircraft for two reasons. Firstly, it was found impossible to carry all the vegetables and mail owing to their unexpected bulk in two Vincents, so that each supply involved two journeys from Muscat to Shuwarniyah, a distance of 500 miles each way, along an exceptionally desolate and forbidding coast* Secondly, owing to the expedition taking longer than was anticipated, more supplies were needed. The additional aircraft commitments meant that 55 Squadron aircraft were unable to complete the piBogramme ov/ing to lack of flying hours before overhaul became due. They were therefore relieved by two Vincents of Ho. 84 (B) Squadron. Return J ourney . 12. On the 4th April, work on the store having been completed, H.M.S.Deptford left Shuwamiyah taking the dhow again in tow and arri ved at Muscat on 8th April. Flight Lieutenant Beeher and the Political Agent returned to Muscat on the 4th April by air. The representative of the Yvali of Dhofar was also returned by air to Salala on the same day. Conclusion. 13. The inhabitants in this part of the world are unruly and primitive. The security of our petrol stores at the various landing grounds very largely depends/depends on the goodwill established by Major ’Wattsj the Political Agentj Muscat* I an grateful on this occasion, as on many others, to Major Watts for his close^^-operation and great help during the whole of the expedition; and in the sanB: sense I wish to record my appreciation of the services rendered by the Officer Commanding and all ranks of H*M.S. 'Deptford'• 14* The succesful completion of a task such as this is only possible with the full &lt;£*&gt;-operation of all concerned - I have great pleasure in inform- -ing you that all assistance on this, as on other occasions, was given in full measure.

I fully agree with the remarks in your letter C/301 dated 3rd Hay, 1938. I feel that the successful outcome of this expedition was due to the manner in which all those carrying it out worked 4 together, and I am very grateful for the assistance rendered by the Political Agent Muscat whose excellent report I have read with great interest.

The tit n of l?uewt # e rep^eentative hrd agreed to the building of a petrol store at a UWAi: IYAH, but he would not be res ^onsible for the attitude of the local tribesmen. This v/as because the Sultan 1 e control is purely nominal south of AUR except for the BOPAR administration. 5. It was therefore necesaaiy for the Political Agent MUSCAT to accompany the expedition and to bring a representative of the MUSCAT Government with him. 6. From a political p int of view the *DKA &gt; T? RD* was required to remain at SHUAAMIYAH to cover the construction of the fuel store and to acoommodete British subjects who were not to be allowed to sleep on shore. PKhAiMIhA Y i-CVKi u AUT 3 . 7.

It was therefore essential to choose a date immediately after an air supply trip so that we should be back at . huvamlyah before the next plane was due to arrive, we therefore decided on 26th Kerch, and sailed at 1300 on that day with the dhovy in tow. 13. *.© arrived at Kerb?: t at 0640 the f llo .ing morning having been able to average 8 knots in a calm sea A working party was landed in the 2 houria and the fuel embarked from the Ke bat store. when the rail cane off to call he brought a large 19. number of followers who in th^ir democratic way joined in o r conversation* The Wall had never been on beard a British man-of-war before, though he had visited a French one some years a o.
