Pres3 Co 'ference Th e Meaning of 'Neutrality”. C^i — In your elucidation of India*s foreign policyin relation tn the + rival power blocs, you have all along stressed the difference between passive neutrality and positive neutrality, mil you define these two concept^ A. - Passive neutrality, as the word says, is a negative thing, of trvino to run away from a problem and trying to avoid it so that no Vntl, trying to one till one is forced to go in. He trv not to in n ° but try to understand it, and face it, andLxercise such YflTT “ problem from time to time, whether it is in the United Nations or in our private ° an contact With other nations. We try to make a positive approach in order to lessen such tension as exists. And to some extent - although I do not T- much from it - we have occasionally succeeded. To give an^xsmnlf 1 Y” been a great difference of opinion in regard to the^ andXS^n^ atomic energy. At the last session of the United Nations, before ?he prefent -one, ultimately a committee rras formed of which a distinguished Indian delegate was chosen as Chairman. His attitude impressed the two rival theorists so much that the whole atmosphere of that committee changed from a warlike atmosphere to a more objective approach to the problem, Whether it led to any permanent results or not is a different question. But the tension was reduced and both parties congratulated the Indian Chairman on his approach to the problem. SLl ~ Would it not be better to drop the word 'British' in the title of the C ommonwealth? A, - It has been dropped. But it is said that people can use both? - I will tell you what exactly happened. It was formally dropped and you will see in the declaration that the first paragraph refers to the present. All the succeeding paragraphs call it the Commonwealth of Nations, Some countries of the Commonwealth - more especially Australia and New Zealand - said: Do you mind if we call ourselves this? I said, you can do what you like. The Position of the King, Si *“ It t-he King were to visit this country, how would we receive him? A» - As the head of a great State. Just as the President of the United States, if he chose to come here - we would receive him as the head of a great State. Or the President of any other country, or the King of any other country. There are not many Kings left. And if our President goes anywhere as head of this State, the same would apply, - You said in your broadcast of May 10th, that a vast majority of the people have approved this decision. In view of the fact that the Socialist Party, the Communist Party and the Hindu Mahasabha have not approved this, and in view of the fact that the All-India Congress Committee have not given any opinion yet, how can you say that the people have approved this decision? A. - From about 40 years experience of the Indian people, Q» - But have not the times changed since then? A. - Yes, I go on changing with them too* - England being at the apex of the Commonwealth countries, if England becomes Socialist, don’t you think that it will be reflected in the economy of other Commonwealth countries? A. - As a matter of fact, among the Commonwealth countries today, Australia and New Zealand have already got Labour Governments which are in varying degrees socialistically inclined. Even so is England. Presumably that will have some effect on others too, Q. ^ What about India? How is it inclined? A. - You know all about it. Why ask me? Meeting with Shaw, Malan and Churchill. Q. - What about your meeting with Bernard Shaw? - As a matter of fact, my Secretary had some strange notion about it and he wanted to come with me and take down verbatim what happened Fortinv^iv I stopped him in time: I pushed him out, ’ ^ ^ Q. - You invited Dr. Malan to lunch. Was that a purely social affair or did you discuss the South African Indian question?A, - No. I had naturally met Dr. Malan in the course of the Conference for a~minute or two. Later our Secretary General^ Mr. Bajpai, #10 had known ,him previously in South Africa, met him and discussed the situation generally * with’'him. Before coming away I thought it would be desirable to meet him also. So I invited him to lunch and we had a talk about the Indian situation in South Africa. We did discuss the matter and all I can say is that we frankly told each other our respective view points. I began by telling him that I did not expect naturally such a difficult and intricate matter could be solved over a lunch conversation. Anyhow I did feel that we should know each other and understand directly each other’s points of view. We did, I believe, have a frank talk; and there the matter ended. Q. - How did Mr, Churchill behave towards you? A. - He was friendly and cordials If I may say so, when he ^sked me to lunch he said that he wanted me to come just to show his friendship and goodwill'for India as it is today and as it is going to be in the future. KASHMIRI 'REPRESENTATIVES TO SIT IN CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. The Constituent Assembly on May 27th adopted Mr, Gopalaswami Ayyangar’s motion that all the four seats j.n the Assembly alloted to the otate of Kashmir may be filled by nomination by the ruler of : that State on the- advice of his Prime Minister. A, ; 'if' ; _ .r ... 4 * • Mr, Ayyangar'wished trhat Kashmir’s representation had been brought about much earlier, but various things had conspired to prevent it. 'We today are in a position to bring to this House four persons who could be said to be fairly representative of uhe population of Kashmir’ , Mr• Ayyangar added. 'The point I wish to urge is that while two of these representatives would in any case,under the present rules, be persons who could be nominated by the ruler, we are suggesting that all' four persons (one representative for every million of the population), should be nominated by the ruler on,the advice of* his Prime Minister, vfe have got to remember that the mime Minis ter and his Government are based upon the fact that they represent tne largest political party in the State,' ■'Kashmir in this motion means the whole of Jammu 'and Kashmir, the sovereignty over the whole of which still remains with the Government of the State. We look upon the State as a whole. We do not recognise anything that may have happened as a result, of the military operations which have been suspended.' Replying to the debate, Mr. Ayyangar said that Kashmir’s accession was 'complete and unconditional'. The Indian Government’s commitment on the question of the plebiscite was simply to the extent that they would not stand in the way of Kashmir separating itself from India, if that was the will of the people. 'So the statement that the accession is at present complete, is a perfectly correct description of the existing state of things. We are not bringing representatives of the State to this House for tne purpose of placing their seal on the act of accession. We are giving them the opportu nity for the exercise of rights they have obtained by the £ot tliat the acces sion has already taken place.” TRAVANGORE AND COCHIN STATES MERGED. Arrangements for integration of the two South Indian States of Travancore and Cochin have now been finalised. According to the Associated Press of India the Maharaja of Travancore, on May 2?th, affixed his signature to the covenant for the merger of the States, Travancore, the third biggest State in India after Hyderabad and Mysore, has an area of 7,661 square miles with a population of more than six million. The annual income of the State is estimated at over Rs. 97*5 million, HCochin State, of about 1,500 square miles, lying between the Western Ghats and the sea in the South-West corner of India, has a population of •... about 1.5 million. The income of the State, according to the budget estimate of last year is Rs. 41.9 million. x x x PRGCTffiSS TOWARDS POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN HYDERABAD . .1 The elections to the Hyderabad Constituent Assembly are expected to' be held towards the end of this year. The spade work for these elections, which will be based on adult franchise, has been completed. This was stated at a News Conference in Hyderabad on May 25th, by the Election Commissioner, Mr. S.W. Shivashwarkar. He said the new Assembly was expected to be composed of 200 members, on a basis of one member for every 70,000 persons. Nine million names out of a total population of 17 millions, had been put on the electoral rolls. More than 60,000 village officers assisted by over 450 election inspectors were employed for the work. Replying to a question, Mr, Shivashwarkar said the work of enumeration had been completed in the districts of Nalgonda and Warangal, where, he added, the Communists had tried to hamper the work. *- X X X X GOVERNCRS TO BE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT . The. Constituent Assembly on May 31st decided that under the new Constitution, the Governors of States (Provinces) shall be appointed by the' Union President. An amendment to this effect moved on May 30th by a member, was passed by an overwhelming majority* Mr.Mua£hL,inember of the Drafting Committee, explaining the reasons why the committee had changed its view on the subject said, it would be better to have a nominated'Governor who was an independent and detached person away from party politics, nominated by the Centre which would be free from the passions and jealousies of local politics. x x x x x SOLVING THE HOUSING PROBLEM. A new type of simple and cheap houses called 'gunited' are being built in Bombay and Delhi, for railway employees* The first colony of such houses; which are being put up for the first’ time in India, is ready at Santa Cruz, Bombay, and was occupied on May 30th. Guniting is a process by which one part of the cement is mixed in a compressor with five parts of sand and the mixture is then shot through a spray gun on to a wire or a bamboo frame, A 'Gunite'’ house costs on an average 50f less than one built with lime and mortar. It is light weight with walls two inches thick, requiring minimum foundations. Such buildings would ideally suit India»s climatic conditions. Each house measuring 320 square feet took on average one day to build and cost about Rs. 2,000. x x x x x VILLA GE S ELF-RULE.

Reviewing the recent session of the U.N. General Assembly, Indian papers expressed satisfaction with India's part in the Assembly's decisions, particularly those on. the South African issue and the Italian colonies. Typical was the comment on the 'Hindu' of Madras of ifey 21st, which observed,- India has a good reason to feel satisfied with the decisions of the U.N. neral nssembly, 'She not only scored a significant victory against South frica, but was instrumental, along with the Arab countries, in defeating the Bevin-Sforza plan for the return of Tripolitania to Italian trusteeship.' . The ^fction of the Bevin-Sforza plan for the former Italian colonies, received unanimous support from the Indian press which particularly welcomed India's stand in the matter. The Statesman' of Delhi May 21st, for instance, observed that whatever may be the feelings'with which the other powers regard 'the veto, in effect applied by India and Haiti, these two countries can at least take credit for averting a potentially very shameful and ugly situation in North Africa.' Writing in a similar strain, the 'Indian Express' of Madras May 20th referred to India's plan for those colonies. 'The plan for a direct U.N. trusteeship', observed the paper, 'has gone down on the rocks of colonialism and power politics once, but it must be revived if U.N. is to ensure the realisation of the triple principle of the welfare of the indigenous inhabi tants, the eventual conferment of real independence on them, and international peace through the elimination of big power rivalry.' PROGRESS IN RESETTLEMENT. Further details are now available of steps being taken to rehabilitate displaced persons in the country. In Rajasthen, 11,000 families, displaced agriculturists from Pakistan, are expected to be resettled on evacuee land in Alwar and Bharatpur. The allotment of land will be on a semi-permanent basis. The unit of allotment is likely to be a maximum of fifteen acres per family, consisting of two adults and'three children. The Central Government which has sanctioned a loan of Rs. 1,000,000 for relief and agricultural loans, to these displaced agriculturists, has advised the Rajasthan Govern ment to take immediate steps to resettle them, so that the land is brought under cultivation for the monsoon crop this year. In Delhi plans are how being worked out for the rehabilitation of about 50,000 displaced families in the capital. This will involve the resettlement of about 250,000 people,- In Baroda, a refugee township, providing housing accommodation for 10,000 displaced persons, is to be built within a few months.NEWS IN BRIEF.

Thf, aims set forth in the Preamble to the Consti tution of the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations include —raising standards of living, —securing improvements in the efficiency of production and distribution, —bettering the conditions of rural populations. These aims have been (Constantly in the minds of mem bers of this Conference throughout their deliberations. 2. The Conference does, in fact, emphasize the importance of forestry in raising the standards of living of the people. In any programme designed to substitute ^ abundance for scarcity, forests and the practice of forestry must play a key role. 3. That Governments must recognise the importance of forest resources and of a scientifically managed forest ■estate is stressed in a resolution, unanimously adopted by the Conference. This resolution urges Governments, inter alia, “ so to manage their forests as to serve the rural and urban population and thus enlist the support of the masses for the implementation of a sound policy for the protection and development of forests.” 4. This resolution further declares ‘ L that any failure by a government to accord due recognition to the great value of forest resources will have disastrous conse quences for the economy of the country.” 5. The Conference has examined, in the time at its disposal, the major problems of this region in the fields of forestry and forast products. The broad findings of the Conference with regard to these problems are set out below. The recommendations of the Con. ference have received the unanimous approval of all delegates. 6. The meetings of the Conference have resulted in a most useful exchange of ideas and experience. It is the agreed opinion of the Confeience that a valuable precedent has been set by this, the first meeting of representatives of the various countries of the region to discuss common problems of forestry and timber utilization. 7. The Conference is agreed that its report and recommendations shall be brought by each delegation to the early notice of its respective Government. It requests the Director-General of FAO to place the report and recommendations before the Council of FAO and the Annual Conference, so as to secure prompt endorse* ment by all member Governments.2 Problems of the Region Forest Policy. 8. The Conference considers that a basic requirement in all countries of the region is that governments should review their existing forest policy, and ensure that certain fundamental principles are expressed in that policy and are actually put into effect. 9. These fundamental principles have been set out by the Conference as follows (a) To reserve in perpetuity for the benefit of the present inhabitants and of posterity, suffici ent land, as well distributed as possible, either already under forest or capable of afforestation, so as to maintain regular How in rivers and mitigate the severity of floods ; to provide forest produce for rural and urban populations; to sustain essential services and industrial development. (b) Consistent with the above, so to manage forests as to obtain the best financial returns. {c) To maintain under forest all land that, would deteriorate or would be less productive if put to any other use. (d) To ensure by legislation and by technical and, if necessary, financial assistance, the practice of sound forest management, in privately owned woodlands. Conservation. 10. The Conference considers that the wasting away of the soil through erosion is oue of the most alarming problems in many countries of the region. It is a menace which threatens the welfare of millions of people and which requires urgent nation-wide, and indeed inter- * national effort, to combat its dangers, a fact which is not yet sufficiently realised by the public and its leaders. 11. In the opinion of the Conference, each govern ment of the region should set up a Central Authority representing cognate interests, including forests, for the co-ordination of both the planning and execution of land utilization and soil conservation measures. Appro priate legislation should lie enacted to provide for powers to control land-use and enforce the observance of soil conservation measures on all lands, both state and private, where they are needed. The Conference advocates the setting up of demonstration areas for the dual purposes of educating the public in the advantages of soil conservation, and of providing practical training for technical staffs. 12. The Conference particularly urges that, where conservation in the headwaters of great rivers is a matter of common concern to several countries, these countries should come together to concert their efforts and arrive at agreed practical measures for the solution of their problems. 13. Domestic Needs in Fuelwood and Cheap Timber The second major problem for many countries is the urgent need for fuel wood and charcoal, and cheap supplies of sawn timber, poles and other building^mate- rials. The Conference is agreed that in the “deficit” countries, immediate steps must be taken to increase the availability of such supplies by all possible means, in cluding the establishment of village fuelwood reserves of quick-growing species and the encouragement of small holders to set aside even a small portion of their land for the growing of fuelwood, poles and timber. The urgency of r.he problem must continually lie brought to the notice of governments, because failure to find a solution may have serious repercussions on social life and on agricul ture. 14. Increased Output ok Forest Products In addition to scarcity of fuelwood and building mate rials, there does exist in the region as a whole a marked shortage of forest products of all other kinds. Purchas ing power is generally low and does not permit of a consumption rate per person which is compatible with a reasonable standard of living. Production is not at present sufficiently great to provide forest products at prices within the means of the vast masses of the popu 4 lation. The reasons for this inadequate production are V considered by the Conference to be— (a) harvesting and utilization being confined to a few favoured species, (b) inadequate attention, in some countries., to efficient silvicultural treatment, (c) incomplete utilization, both in the forest and iu the process of conversion, of such species as are being harvested, and (d) lack of modern extraction and milling facilities, inadequate communications and transport. The means of overcoming these deficiencies are suggested in one of the Conference resolutions. Atten tion is especially drawn to the need for governments to draw up specific lists of their requirements in forestry equipment, and logging and milling machinery, and to apprise FAO of their requirements. lo. The Conference considers that the conservation of natural resources and the provision of domestic needs in fuelwood, charcoal and timber are the two outstanding problems of immediate urgency in many countries of the region. Solutions for these problems have also long- w term implications. Hold schemes of protection and reforestation of the headwaters of great rivers are needed, projects to combat soil erosion, programs of afforestation and measures to effect flood control. Only thus can food production and agriculture be made secure, water sup plies be safeguarded, and living conditions be ameliorated. The effort required for these purposes surpasses purely local or national interests. An international approach is necessary. Itf- The countries of the region also need to accept and adopt new concepts of utilization of forest resources aud to secure intensive output of forest products by means of integrated industries. Traditional methods of management certainly have theii place, but research andscientific progress offer new horizons to the forester. Forestry and silviculture are not ends in themselves but only means to produce, on a sustained yield basis, the kinds and quantities of forest products needed by the people, by industry and by trade. IT. It is obvious that the progress for which the members ot this Conference hope and which they will certainly strive to bring about, cannot be achieved with out the most careful planning and meticulous prepara tion. The Conference therefore urges all countries, even at this time of economic and political stress, to draw up well-considered plans for the conservation, expansion and development of their forests. Finanok 18. The United Nations and its specialised agencies are now sketching the outlines of a great new venture of technical help and assistance for the vast under developed regions of the world. The opportunity must be seized to bring forestry, in its widest sense, fully into this venture, and governments should keep the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations informed of their plans and projects. « 19. The reason is that these plai® and projects will require considerable capital investment and financing. For this purpose, private or national investment may be nei ther sufficient in volume, sufficiently dependable in flow, sufficiently well distributed geographically, nor be suit ably adjusted to the types of investment required. The help of the United Nations and its specialized agencies should therefore be sought in finding ways and means of deriving the capital needed. It is clear, however, that capital, whatever its source, will not be attracted unless the development projects are sound in concept, precise in detail, and realistic in scope. Trade 20. At this stage it is appropriate to point out that many countries of the region have exportable surpluses of timber and other forest products, and that there should be an accelerated How of these surplus supplies to countries where shortages are particularly acute. The Conference has recommended that FAO should review the import requirements and export availabili ties of the various countries of the region, with a view to arriving at a reasonable balance between overall demand and supplies. Trade policies of some countries need to be overhauled, and trade promotion pushed for ward by governments with vigour and far-sightedness. Labour 21. The Conference recognises the intimate relation ship which must exist between forestry and the labour force which makes successful forestry and profitable forest industries possible. There are numerous examples where proper consideration for the forest worker and the mill labourer, and their families, in the form of housing facilities, provision of schools, medical care, recreational amenities, and other community services, have meant increased production, a more stabilized working force, and a greater concern for good forest management. Sustained-yield forestry assures permanent employment and steady incomes. Organised labour will not fad to support, forest policies which will afford them good wages and a secure home and future. The Formation of a Regional Forestry and Forest Products Commission 22. The Conference has given considerable thought to the type of continuing organisatian that will make possible that large measure of international co-operation which its deliberations have shown to be necessary in the region. The members of the Conference are in agreement that the following recommendation is appro priate to this purpose. 28. The Conference Recommends the establishment ot a Forestry and Forest Products Commission for Asia and the Pacific, consisting of accredited representatives ot all countries in the region, which should meet as and when necessary, to co-ordinate matters of common interest to the region ; to examine particular problems in the fields of forestry and forest products, both of immediate urgency and long-term significance; and make recommendations to governments through the Council of FAO. This Commission, when established, should work in close consultation and accord with the United Nations Econo mic Commission for Asia and the Far East, and with all other United Nations agencies existing within the region. Recommends further, that in order to organise the work of this Commission, the Director-General of FAO set up a forestry and forest products Working Group in. the region, composed of staff members of the Organisa tion's Division of Forestry and Forest Products. 24. The Conference considers that, on the basis of its general recommendations, the immediate tasks to be . allotted to this Working Group of the Division of Forestry and Forest Products are (а) To press for the adoption by governments of the appropriate recommendations of this Confer ence. (б) To arrange for the exchange of technical and professional information on forestry and forest products between the various countries of the region. (c) To arrange tor the meeting of technical experts to discuss the standardization of grades and sizes of timber and plywood, nomenclature and trade terms The Conference wishes to bring to the notice of the Director-General of FAO an offer made to the Conference by the delegate of France that this meeting he convened in Saigon. {d) To arrange for a first meeting of the Forest Research Committee referred to in Resolution XVIII {e) To make arrangements for an exchange of spe cialists, technicians and students between the various countries of the region, as governments may require.4 Resolutions adopted by the Conference 1. The Importance of Forest Resources The Conference, Recognising that, forests, as renewable assets, are essential to a country’s agricultural life, industrial deve lopment, economic stability and national security, Recognising, also, that forests and forest products, both major and minor, are essential to the life of (.he rural and urban population, Calls the attention of the governments of all countries of the region to the need for dynamic policies for the conservation, development, and utilization of forest resources, according to the needs and possibilities of each country. Declares that any failure by a government to accord due recognition to the great value of forest resources will have disastrous consequences for the economy of the country, both rural and industrial. Urges governments so to manage their forests as to serve the rural and urban population and thus enlist the support of the masses for the implementation of a sound policy for the protection and development of forests, even though this may involve some restriction on the actions of individuals in the interests of the community as a whole. Thus the precious heritage of forest resources can be passed on unimpaired from generation to gene ration. Recommends that the attention of the governments of the region be drawn to the desirability of giving a high priority in their national, financial and economic plans to the claims of forestry and the improvement of harvest ing facilities. • 11. Forest Policy The Conference, Recognises the great importance to the region as a whole, as well as to each of its component parts, {a) of supplying the rural populations with fuell, fodder and timber for domestic and agricul tural requirements, (b) of producing a sustained yield of timber and other forest produce, (c) of encouraging the most economical utilization of timber and other forest products, (d) of maintaining and improving climate and physical conditions in the interests of agri- culture and water supply. Considers that each of the governments of the region should lay down a definite forest policy to be adminis tered by a properly constituted and adequate forest service. Recommends that the basic principles of such a forest policy for all the countries in the region should be— (a) To reserve in perpetuity for the benefit of the present inhabitants and of posterity, sufficient land, as well distributed as possible^ either already under forest or capable of afforestation, so as to maintain regular flow in rivers and mitigate the severity of floods; to provide forest produce for rural and urban popula tions ; to sustain essential services and industrial development, (b) Consistent with the above, so'to manage forests as to obtain the best financial returns, (c) To maintain under forest all land that would deteriorate or would be less productive if put to any other use, (French: Soal a vocation forestiere). (d) To ensure by legislation and by technical and, if necessary, financial assistance, the practice of sound forest management in privately owned woodlands. Further Recommends that all governments review their existing forest policy and set up a national or federal coordinating authority, where necessary, to embody the principles enumerated above and ensure their implementation. 111. Soil Conservation The Conference, Recognising ( 1) that in most countries of the region soil erosion is a national menace, threatening their welfare and requiring a nation-wide effort to combat the dangers, and that this fact is not yet sufficiently realised by the public and its leaders, (2) that the alarming and increasing prevalence of accelerated erosion by wind and water is evidenced by— (a) the increasing frequency and magnitude of floods which cause incalculable damage to property and food crops by inundation, deposition of sand and detritus, and the destruction of both major and minor irrigation works, (b) reduction in the lives of reservoirs and the navigability of rivers through the deposition of silt, and (c) the decline in the fertility of soil, due to erosion of the topsoil, and by the lowering of the water table and by the diminution of surface water supplies generally, (3) that in most countries there is a lack of men trained in soil-conservation methods and research, (4) that the experience of several countries, both of this region and elsewhere, has shown that systematic and progressive action in the execution of soil conserva tion measures is possible only by legislation, and (5) that the essence of soil conservation lies in the planned allocation of each land type to the purpose for which it is best suited, Recommends (1) the setting up of a Central Autho rity in each country representing cognate interests, including forests, for the co-ordination of both planning and execution of land utilization and soil conservation ;5 (2) The enactment of legislation appropriate to the needs of each country, where such legislation does not already exist, to provide for powers to control land-use and enforce the observance of soil conservar.ion measures on all lands, both state and private, where they are needed ; (3) The setting up of research stations to examine problems of erosion, land utilization, conservation, and restoration of degraded lands ; (4) The inclusion of soil conservation in the curri cula of forestry and agriculture training institutions, and the arrangement of study tours abroad ; (5) The setting up of demonstration areas for the dual purposes of educating the public in the advantages of soil conservation, and the practical training of staff ; (6) The inculcation in the public mind of a sound sense of land utilization by a vigorous campaign of education and publicity. IV. International Co-operation in Erosion Control The Conference, Recognising that the damage which has been and ^ ' is being caused by floods and siltation in some countries is often due to lack of conservation in the headwaters of rivers which originate in other countries, Recommends that the countries concerned should come together with a view to concerting soil conservation measures in such river basins, and that they should seek the good offices of FAO for suggestions and technical advice. V. Forests and Climate The Conference, Recognising (1) that weather exercises a major control over forests in respect to growth, yield, and liability to pests and diseases, (2) that climate and forests naturally react on each other in a variety of ways, (3) that the micro-climate of a forest is different to that of the adjacent open area, Recommends that the problems of weather in relation to forestry be included in the terms of reference of the permanent sub-commission of agricultural meteorology tor Asia, as constituted by the International Meteoro logical Organisation for Region II, Asia. VI. Control of Grazing The Conference, Recognising (1) that in many areas forests are inter spersed with cultivated lands, and therefore have to cater for the fodder and grazing needs of live-stock, (2) that the growing of trees and provision of fodder are conflicting demands on land which can overlap only to a limited extent, (3) that excessive and uninterrupted grazing of pasture within forests will upset the delicate ecological balance existing and will result in deterioration of both forests and pasturage, (4) that the recurrent burning of pasture leads to deterioration of soil and is one of the most important causes in initiating soil-erosion, Recommends (1) that ways and means be devised to maintain the optimum balance between tree growth and the adverse agency of grazing, so as to perpetuate both the forests and the pasture ; (2) that systematic research in agrostology be organised to determine (a) the ideal grazing closure cycle and the optimum intensity of grazing for each type of pasture, and (b) the best methods of improving pastures; (3) that the allocation of grazing within forests be controlled in such a manner that the maximum grazing is supplied without impairing the regenerative capacity of the forests ; (4) that strong and effective measures be taken to prevent and to prohibit the tiring of grass lands, and that severe penalties be enforced on offenders. VII. Roving Agriculture The Conference, Recognising (1) that the prevalance of the widespread practice of roving agriculture by both nomadic and settled populations in the countries of this region results in very low standards of living, (2) that the effects of this practice are pernicious and result in the economic loss of forests, the destruction of soil and the silting up of water courses situated below the cleared areas, (3) that the increasing demand for fresh forest land for roving agriculture as the result of a growing popu lation necessitates some form of restriction to prevent- destruction of forests, (4) that the ultimate solution of the problem depends on a broad-based policy which embraces the fields of forestry, agriculture and social welfare, Recommends that the menace of roving agriculture be brought to the notice of governments concerned, and that the practice be urgently and carefully regulated by the gradual introduction of, (a) a planned system of reforestation by agri-silvi- cultural methods, (b) systems of permanent agriculture, involving the cultivation of paddy in irrigable areas, or dry farming of arable crops in rotation with pasture and fodder, under a system of alternate husbandry, and (c) the planting of permanent economic crops, provided that in all cases steps are taken to adopt the necessary soil conservation measures. VIII. Large-scale Afforestation and Reforestation The Conference, Recognising (1) that the populations of this region are rapidly increasing,6 (2) that, an adequate supply of all forest products is necessary if the standard of living of the increasing population is sc lie maintained and improved, (3) that the forests in some countries of the region are insufficient in extent to guarantee such a future supply, (4) that there exist in some countries large tracts of land suitable for forestry, but not for agriculture, Recommends that forest areas be extended by vigorous and large-scale afforestation and reforestation programmes on ail suitable lands. IX. Domestic Needs The Conference, Recognising (T) that the urgent need for fuelwood and charcoal in some parts of the region results in enforced use of dried animal dung as fuel, thus robbing the land of critically needed fertilizer, (2) that lack of an adequate and cheap supply of sawn timber, poles and other building materials is lowering the standard of living of many Asian peoples, is impeding post-war reconstruction, and is adversely affecting the housing of displaced persons, (3) that supply of fuelwood and agricultural imple ments is largely met from woodlands privately owned, Recommends (1) that immediate steps be taken to increase the availability of fuelwood and charcoal by all possible means and specifically by (a) Government subsidised transport from areas of surplus production to areas of acute scarcity. (I&gt;) the installation of modern charcoal kilns with the object of reducing waste to a minimum. (c) Government management of privately owned woodlands where such woodlands are not already being worked for the Itenefit of the community as a whole, (d) the immediate planning and implementation of widespread afforestation schemes, in tracts where the deficiency has reached a critical stage, and generally, the establishment of village fuelwood reserves of quick grow ing species and the planting up of all available State lands including strips bordering canals, roads and railways, where feasible, and (e) encouraging small-holders to set aside even a small portion of their land for the production of firewood, poles, and timber. (2) that the availability of sawn timber and other house building materials be increased by such measures as (а) the chartering of ships to bring bulk cargoes of cheap timber from overseas countries having an exportable surplus. (б) the reduction of rail freights from the forest to consuming centres, (c) the most economical use of such timber as is available, and (d) the use of secondary species after treatment with preservatives. (3) that the vital necessity of supplying the densely populated areas of the region with timber and fuel, be brought to the notice of the governments concerned as a matter requiring immediate action. . • X Increased Production The Con k e r e nc k, Recognising that full production in this region is hampered (o) by harvesting and utilization being confined to a few favoured species, {b) by inadequate attention, in some countries* to efficient silvicultural treatment, (c) by incomplete utilization, both in the forest and in the process of conversion, of such species as are being harvested, ami (&lt;7) by lack of modern extraction and milling facilities, inadequate communications and transport, Recommends (1) that forest authorities in all coun tries endeavour to develop the use of secondary species by propaganda and by research in wood seasoning and preservation; and in modern processing methods and manufacturing technique, (2) that the increased economic use of timber and bamboo in structural engineering be promoted through research and propaganda. (3) that forest authorities examine and overhaul, if necessary, their existing silvicultural practices and their methods of felling, extraction and conversion, with a view to the reduction of waste, at all stages, to a mini mum. (4) that through the good offices of KAO govern ments seek to arrange for the supply, at reasonable rates, of tractors, bull-dozers, trucks and all types of modern extraction and milling machinery. To this end, interested countries should submit detailed list of their requirements to FAO, XI. Balancing Supplies and Demand Th k Conferenck, Recognising (1) that certain countries of this region are unable from their own resources to meet their immediate requirements in timber and other forest products, needed for structural and industrial purposes, (2) that other countries of the region have exportable surpluses of timber and other forest products available for such purposes, Recommends (1) that FAO ascertain the import requirements and export possibilities of the various countries of the region, with a view to achieving a reasonable balance between overall demand and supplies. (2) that all countries, and particularly the “deficit” countries, make every endeavour to increase production without infringing the principle of sustained yield ; and specifically, that forests, hitherto unworked but potentially productive, be rendered accessible as rapidly as possible.7 —*■ XH. Distribution of Timber Thk Confkbencb, B E .000 n i s i n &lt;i 1-hat there exist ditiieulties and obstacles to the distribution of timber from one country to another, and from one area to another within the same country, thus preventing the easy movement of timber from areas of production to centres of consump tion, Broohmkxds that governments take all possible steps to facilitate the movement of timber, especially from “surplus” countries to 'deficit” countries; in particular, that interested countries press for thu reduc tion of rail and ocean freight rates. XIII. Standardization and Grading The Conference, Considering (1) that, in each country and for the region as a whole, it is most desirable to bring about a measure of uniformity and standardization in grading rules tor timber and plywood, in the sizes of sawn timber, and in the nomenclature of timbers ami the definition of _ trade terras, (2) that it is also most desirable to bring about international standardization of methods for testing the. physical and mechanical properties of timber and ply wood, Recommends (1) that hAO arrange ioi the immediate exchange of information on current practice in the different countries, and convene a technical meeting to examine, as a matter of urgency, to what extent such standardization is possible, in the light of the considerable amount of work which has already been carried out in this field. (2) that as an interim measure, and until the proposed technical committee is able to examine the whole position, a revision of specifications be undertaken to ensure closer utilization on a. more realistic basis. and that, in particular, there be some relaxation of the very exacting railway sleeper specifications existing in some importing countries of the region. XIV. Forest Inventories The Conference, Recognising (1) that a detailed knowledge of the nature and extent of a nation’s forest resources is essen tial if forest management and industrial development are to be undertaken in a planned and orderly fashion t (2) that most countries in the region do not possess reliable figures for the whole of their forest areas ( (3) that the newly developed techniques of aii survey and statistical method enable large-scale forest inventories to be made at a reasonable cost and in a reasonable time, Recommends (1) that all countries in the region which have not already done so, initiate comprehen sive inventories of their forest resources, and aim to complete Them within the next five years. (2) that the most effective method of making such inventories is by a combination of air survey and ground sampling, the latter designed on a sound statistical basis. (H) that the minimum information to be gathered in a forest inventory should consist of figures of the total forest area, sub-divided into Productive Forests and Other Forests and into major forest types ; of approximate total volume figures; and of estimates of the approximate potential yield. Further Recommends that, as some natural forest regions should be treated as one unit for survey purposes although they overlap the boundaries of two or more states, the countries concerned jointly sponsor and pay for r.he mrial] photography covering such natural forest units, in the interests of economy and efficient working. XV. Enumeration Methods The Conference, Recognising (1) that more detailed information than can be gathered from primary surveys is required for working plans and other forest management purposes, (2) that many different ways and means exist of obtaining this more precise information, Recommends that FAO act as a clearing house for information on the best methods of enume ration, and in particular disseminate the results of recent research on sampling methods. XVI. Minor Forest Products The Conference, Recognising that little or no data exist concerning the availability of commercially important minor forest, products and the extent to which they are used in trade and in industry, Recommends that governments undertake quantitative and qualitative surveys of all important minor forest products, with a view to determining to what extent supplies currently available meet the various demands of trade and industry. In this r*&amp;pect it is particularly desirable that import and export statistics compiled should be kept separate for each commodity and not be grouped together with others of the same class. XVII. Statistics The Conference, Recognising the importance to governments of having prompt and reliable statistics on the production, trade and consumption of forest products, Urges governments to improve the reliability of their statistics and to furnish them promptly to FAO, so that a correct picture of supply and demand within the region can be presented and kept up-to-date. 1 WK»XVIII Research Thk Conference Recognising (1) that research in forestry and forest products is essential if the forest resources of the region are to be put to their best use, (2) that some excellent forest research institutes already exist in the region, (3) that these existing institutes are insufficient in number to serve all the research needs of the region, and moreover are inadequately distributed geographically, (4) that there are no facilities existing for co-ordi nating the research work now being carried out by different countries, and (5) that, in general, research should know no political boundaries and under some circumstances should certainly be international in scope, Recommends (1) that all governments recognise the importance of forest research to the present and future economy of their countries, and provide sufficient funds to enable adequate research programmes to be carried out. (2) that a regional Forest Research Committee be organised whose terms of reference would be, (a) to make a detailed survey of the region’s needs for forest research and of how well these needs are being met by existing research institutions (b) to recommend the setting up of further research stations where these are needed by individual countries, (c) to examine the need for and the practical possi bility of co-operative regional research station dealing with problems common to more than one country ; for example, an international forest products research laboratory to investi- ' gate the pulping properties of secondary species not now being utilised, and (d) to take all possible measures to co-ordinate the research that is being done by different coun tries, with a view to ensuring that all aspects of the region’s research needs are being covered and that unnecessary duplication of research ft prevented. (3j that FAO act as a clearing house for all matters connected with the organisation of research and specifically should (a) create machinery for the exchange of research programmes, and (6) assist member countries in locating research technicians and research equipment. XIX Exchange of Information The Conference, Recognising (1) that there is a mass of technical information already available in several countries which is not known to other countries of the region, (2) that there is need for free and quick exchange of information between the countries of the region, Recommends (1) that all governments co-operate irith FAO in creating machinery to facilitate the quick exchange of technical information on forestry and forest products, the machinery to be as follows :— (a) Governments to supply twice yearly to the FAO Regional Office complete lists of all new publications, together with abstracts in English or French, (b) the FAO Regional Office to distribute the lists to all governments, (c) the exchange of publications to be directly between governments and not through the FAO Regional Office, and FAO, and (d) Governments to supply, on request, to any other country a limited number of copies, in the first instance, free of cost. (2) that, in order that the FAO publication Unasyiva may be of greater value to recipient countries, each country appoint correspondents who will keep the Editor of Unasyiva supplied with items of special interest concerning their own countries. XX. Dissemination of Information The Conference, Recognising (1) that successful forestry can only be carried out if the general public is forest minded, (2) that the general public in the countries of this region have yet. to develop a forest consciousness, Recommends (1) that the Forest Services of all countries realize that the work of educating the general public in forestry and forest conservation is an impor tant part of their duties. (2) that this work be vigorously pursued by a pro gramme of public lectures and radio talks, documentary and instructional film shows, dissemination of popular literature, organised tours, exhibitions and demonstra tions. XXI. Training and Education The Conference, Recognising (1) that there is urgent need in all countries of the region for an increase of trained foresters and of trained technicians for forest industries, (2) that there exist; in most of these countries facilities for forestry training which could be expanded to meet the increased requirements of the countries themselves or their neighbours, (3) that the special features of forestry training and the particular need for development of an esprit de corps, require that forestry schools should be of a socialised nature, (4) that facilities for training technicians exist in the region only to a limited extent, (5) that it is desirable to arrange for exchange of specialists and technicians as between countries of the region, and (6) that the need is keenly felt to spread knowledge of and stimulate interest in forestry, and so develop a forest consciousness among the general public.Recommends (1) that the government of every country in the region promptly take the necessary steps to increase the training facilities in forestry, either by expansion of existing schools or by establishing specialised schools anew. (2) that al 1 governments furnish to FAO particulars of training facilities in existence in their respective countries, and the extent to which such facilities can be made available to other countries in the region, or on the other hand their actual requirements which they would like to be met by other countries. Considers (1) that it is desirable for forestry training to be imparted in specialised schools and for such schools to be closely associated with forest research stations ; also forestry schools should have an entity of their own, unless any local conditions require otherwise; forestry schools may be associated with Universities where it may be of advantage to the school. Further, to ensure adequate standards of education in its forest schools, each country should set up a central board of forest education. (2) that the countries of the region will do well to have their initial complement of technicians trained ' early in countries in the region or outside it, where adequate facilities for such training exist. (3) that machinery for the exchange of specialists and technicians should be set up early by FAO (4) that the government of every country in the region should take steps, without delay, to include graded teaching of forestry as an integral part of the general educational system of the country and should prepare suitable text-books and programmes for this purpose. XXII. Conservation of Wild Life The Conference Recognising (1) that wild life is an integral part of forests, (2) that the survival of wild life is being endangered by an increasing number of illicit and harmful practices, (3) that commercialisation of wild life ultimately leads to extinction of the species, Recommends (1) that forests be zoned into strict Natural Reserves, National Parks and Intermediate Areas ; and a system of sanctuaries, close seasons, and rest-periods within open seasons be enforced. (2) that effective steps be taken to check unlicensed and unrestricted forms of shooting and other forms of killing and capture. (3) that protective measures be adopted for the preservation of threatened species by (a) declaring them to be partially or absolutely protected, and (b) rigorous control of the sale and export of both live animals and skins and, if necessary, a complete embargo.
