In view of .the fact that the circumstances which made the original prohibition necessary did not at the time exist on any of the other frontiers of India, and that as soon as I those circumstances were found to apply elsewhere, steps were at once taken to extend the prohibition accordingly, I feel confident that you will agree that the Government of India 7 s/ Mirza Mohammed Khan Shayesteh* etc., etc., etc.,Indie' e action does not involve any discrimination against the Iranian Governmento I have the honour to be # with high consideration.

Xahwcirlyl Harkisondas Gheeealla hails from Surat but has settled down in Bombay. He resides at Jferuti Lane, Bhuleshwar Bombay. He worked a 8 a clerk in Messrs. Little and Co., Solicitors, and also in the firm of Messrs. Ardeshir Hormusji Dinshaw and Co. t Solicitors, Bombay. He left the latter firm in 1924 and joined the cotton firm of Vardhaman Brothers. In 1928 Vfcrdhaman Bros, became bankrupt. Ishwarlal Gheewalla, therefore, carried on the business in his own name. In September last he applied for a passport which was given. Among the places he wanted to visit were Germany, Austria, Italy, Persia, Japan, China and Egypt. He wa s out of Bombay for about a couple of months. It appears that he did not go to Europe, China, Japan or Egypt, but visited Persia only. His servant named R.L.Joshi accompanied him. Prom his (servant’s) passport it appears that I ah wa rial visited Hbk-Kundi, Mlrjawa, zahedan, etc. Ishwarlal* 8 statement to his friends was that he went to Persia in order to purchase some carpets and curios and sell them here. x x x x x A friend of mine named Jagjiwan Ujamsey had given me information that Ishwarlal Gheewala had been to some unknown countries for the purpose of bringing in diamonds without paying Customs duties and that he was doing jatfc that business on behalf 0 f Mohanlal Hemchand, a diamond merchant now in Antwerp.

He openly gave information against cotton merchants and share brokers who were fraternising with the Congress. He is a very outspoken and honest man so far as I know* You can find out from Persia what Gheewalla went there for and what business he inquired about* He had been there Xxtokm twice* He went there by train. From Bombay he went to Hyderabad # thence to Quetta, thence to Hok-Kundi and thence into the inner parts of Persia by motor. He returned by the same route.

Sir, ' ' ' n, I '[Jr I have the honour to refer to ikj despatch No.77-15/1 of 11 th February 1935 and to report that the lack of any Customs Control on oar Baluchistan frontier appears now to he liKely to be exploited to an extent which merits serious consideration. , t At a Conference held at v uetta in December 1931, at which I was present, a suggestion was made to the •*Vv effect that a Customs Barrier should be established at a convenient place. The real object or such a Barrier as then contemplated, was to give the police powers, under the Customs Act to search the lugga e etc of persons suspected of carrying to India undesir able Bolshevik literature and letters for Soviet agents in India, without the excuse oi a •Customs* Barrier it was understood that the police had no power to search such persons without a warrant and such a warrant could seldom he obtained in time. This proposal was suose^uLentiy not approved uy the Government of India. On the other hand consiaeratio has, at various times been given to this matter of the desirability or otherwise or establishing Customs i. ft CLOSURE IN : ;NbiA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Latter No Ci M. j Dated 1 5 MAR. 1333 control#N control, for purely Customs purposes. Hitherto the matter has always been regarded i'rom the point of vi^ of 1 . Exports from Persia 2. The possibility of goods imported to Persia via India, and enjoying drawback of 15 /I 6 ths of Indian duty, being re-exported to India. as regards i, it appears to have been considered by the Indian Customs Authorities that the expense of maintaining Customs Control on this frontier would not be justified by the Revenue derived, since much of the expprt from Persia would be *in transit* through India only, and pay only 1 / 16 th duty. A further consideration presumably *as, that the collection of duty upon Persian goods destined for internal India would discourage trade by this route and the customs Atv/~ Revenue derived might be offset by the result^ loss to the N.W.Rly branch line. As regards 2, steps have been tanen during the past two years to strengthen the rules under which the Customs Refund takes place at Zahidan and I consider that there is very little iixiihood of re-exportation on a scale which would merit attention. a. During the past year* my attention has oeen drawn on several occasions to a new form of traffic by this route, of the previous existence of which there is no evidence, and which seems likely to be far more vexatious tha1\the direct Perso-Indo traffic which has hitherto been dealt with. I reler to the apjarentl 1 \ steadily increasing 'transit' traffic through Persia to India. It has be^n ascertained that, as a general rule, goods in transit are not examined in Persia. In l ■m rm In July 1932, a consignment of 38 cases arrived from Russia, at feshad and w^re declared as in transit to India and containing 'sealing Wax'. Considerable zv care was taken by a person known to be acting for the Russians to ensure that the goods were not opened at Veshad and that they were speedily released and forwarded to Zahidan. As the circumstances were suspicious I reported the matter to the x^olice in India, Two cases consigned to Quetta and 36 to Peshawar were examined in India. The contents were reported to be ur objectionable, but I was not informed what they actually were. I incline to the view that this consignment, which was without doubt being imported by one of the Russian trading concerns in ^eshaa, was in the nature of a trial run, to ascertain what difficultt$ if any, existed, ; That this was so, seems to be confirmed by news of a more recent event, of a similar nature, at Keshaa, but which does not appear to be a normal trade transaction. On January 25th 1933, 12 cases arrived at S'eshad Custarns-House from Russia in transit for India. The contents were declared as 'Telegraph Wire*. For some reason the suspicions of the Persians was aroused and this particular consignment was examined. The ooxes were found to contain 1160 ^ ilos of silver in bars Tomans (Roughly £2500). The Director of Customs, who has gone to valued at not less than 24,000/lehran, has reserved action in this matter to himself and forbidden his subordinates to deal with it while he is absent from reshad. Meanwhile, it has been learnt that a consider able sum of money has been offered to a subordinate as « an inducement to eiiect release of the goods or at least to obscure the fact that they we^e wrongly declared. ItIt is prcTbabie that this was derived rrun nieiting Krans which had been ta^en in payment for Kussian smuggled, goods and which had been exported to Russia. The silver value in India consideraoly exceeds the market value of brans as coins. It is unlikely that the export of this sliver to India was solely for the the sake of the profit involved and I believe that the main object was to remit funds to Soviet agents in India. I have already reported in my 77-15/10 that diamonds are being sent into India by this route, in such a case the post is used. The parcel post via Zahidan to India is now very considerable. Large quantities of Persian silk are sent to India by post. It seems likely that besides parcels from Persia, packets from Russia etc also enter India by this route. If this be so, as there is no Gut toms examination, it would not be impossible to smuggle arms, money or valuable and easily convertible goods, and propaganda literature, ana if the Russians h^ve a*axened to the fact that large consignments of goods can pass through Persia direct to India without any examination, there seems every reason to believe that they are also using the post for smaller consignments. I would suggest therefore, for the consideration of the Government cf India that the Postal authorities in Baluchistan might be asxea to provide statistics of the parcel post entering India during the past year via Zahidan - if possible shewing the countries of origin of such parcels (Although it must be borne in mind that it would be a simple matter for the Russian Trading concerns to smuggle small goods into Persia - such as Jewels or arms and to despatch parcels fromwithin Persia to avoid suspicion). If such statistics are not available, it tAOuld presumably be a simple matter lor a record to be kept over a period or say, six months. ^ I understand that the Hon'ble the A in Baluchistan, has power to order an examination ol‘ the contents of specific parcels or mails. The difficulty would be that it is almost impossible to decide which packets to examine and to examine even all the contents of a given mail would involve labour which could not be performed by the existing staff. If this be so, it would seem that the establishment of Gus tomscontrol, which would enable all packages, postal and otherwise, to be examined as a regular proceeding, is now the only means of coping with what is likely to become an increasing menace. The fact that the Russians have apparently decided that Persia is the best base for •Comintern* activities against India may well be connected with the ease ■- ith which they hope to pass funds, or goods to be sold in India to provide funds, via Baluchistan into India. Copies of this despatch, together with copies or | my despatch No. 77-15/10 referred to herein, are being sent to His Fajes ty *s Minister at Tehran and to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan I have the honour to he, t&gt;ir, four most obedient servant Sd/- C.K.Daly FaJ or.

He also impprts Russian goods via Persia. Such goods pass through Persia f in transit* and are not subject to Oustoms examination. Apart frcm the loss to our Customs aoministration if this trade develops, it seems likely to me that the route is oeing usee, as a means of conveying goods, convertible into money, for the payment of Russian Agents and Communists in India. I have no previous information regarding Ishar Lai, but perhaps the Government of India will thin*. it advisable that his antecedents be inquired into, and his activities watched.

During the five years vhich have elapsed since the pa sopor t system was applied to this frontier only two pass ports had been reported lost prior to April 1st, 1928. That three ahmild have been lost within the ensuing three months can hardly be a mere coincidence, and although as a result of careful inquiries I have been unable to discover anything definite, I strongly suspect that the missing passports have found their way (probably through ths new Soviet Consulate in Siotan) to the department of the kuaaian Secret Service which euppliee forged or stolen passports to agents working in foreign countries.

I navs thfe honour to refer to lay predeceonor' s l ospatch Ho. S6I of Bth ept®EiOer 19iiB to the OovernKent of India, a copy of wHlob waa nent to you. Ur Skrine drew attention to the faot that during the five years which eXapoed since the i^as^port aysteiR was introduced t&gt;y the ^rsiam on^.y two pap-sporte ware reported as lost prior to April 1st He wur disturbed at the loss of tnree r n passports during the ensuing three wonths and strongly suspected that a trade in these documents was starting. That Wt f&gt;krine's suspicions m&amp;y well have ot*en daBed on fact appears likely when we consider subsequent records. ccording to lay files no lees than ^4 passports were lost in Persia in 1931, and of these 3 were lost in this Consulate area. ^hen a passport ic lost, it is possible to issue, in lieu of a new passport, a Certificate of Kationality, provided tne holder does not intend to leave Persia in the near future. In practice however, British Indians always protest against thie procedure and veam to he fully aware of the fact that, under existing regulations, H.M, Consular officers cannot refure to issue a fresh passport, if the applicant states that he derires to leave the country. In fact it is Bjr experience that they invariably announce that they are about to leave for Ira&gt;i India or elsewhere ana require a passport. .otually having securei a freab passport they apparently change their minds am stay in Persia. For travel to India they could tae preaumabig q# isaued with an Emergency Certificate for the single Journey, on which theya. ? io a. ooulu ®oiaeti&amp;tio* out iipvarufitly not alwayst ootain ^ police exit visa, woula thejfc have to o&amp;tain a n&lt;r* passport in Inttia, Tills is «enc»rally a diTliouit ana lengthy ousinecs. The authorities do not raaaily Isaue a paeaport to an individual who nas been ioi.g abnent tvou bis boae in India anb some months often elapse oefore a document can be procured. Consequently applicants for a fresh passport aa&lt;.e every effort to obtain one in Persia, They plead that they only desire tp proceed to Kundl or quetta and great loss of time and money etc would, result fro* having to return to their homes to get a new document or «?ait in Quetta until the necessary references to the local authorities have been made etc ect. The Consul thus applied to is placed in a difficult position. fp it is true that under the terms of Foreign Office letter T/1&amp;614/d1/378 of October 14th 19*6 the Consul is directed to refuse a fresh passport, unless * You are yourself coapletely satisfied that his statement is correct'. £ The point is that a Consular officer can seldtaa, if ever, be * satisflea * in this respect, o The declaration is generally to the effect tnat the passport must have 'Iroppea from the holders pocicet' during a journey, or some equally specious explanation, which it is quit* impossible to verify and in view of the very frequent losses of passports cannot but be regarded with suspicion. h Presumably the applicant could be made to feign a ‘• clean declaration or affirmation” of the circumstances of the loss, but in the event of the declaration proving false it seems that no action could be taken and the document is valueless ac a safeguard. /£f In a case at ;,ahidan such an affirmation was made and actually proved subsequently,to be false.

It is remarkable that of all the passports alleged to be innocently lost, very few indeed are wv«r recovered, A case came to my notice in Birjand some months ago which throws some light on the matter. -an Indian subject lost his passport. The oircuifiotarioes were not suspicious, at first. The individual reported the loss am isaae every endeavour to recover the uocuuient, including the offer of a substantial reward. A few days later information was received froa a third party that the document had been found by a Persian and taken to the police. On applying to the latter, all knowledge of the matter was denied. The Persian informant secretly told the holder that his information was correct, but that he had been terrified by the police and if called would have to deny any knowledge of the matter. It was only when I let it be known that X was taking an interest in th** iaatter that the police subsequently produced the passport together with a palpably false statement of the circumstances, which however, it would be almost impossible to prove against them. 7^ That the police interned to dispose of the paaa^ort to their own advantage cannot but be suspected.4 ; Umar present curcuma tuncse a wuuici it not w ao visa Die to ✓ r«fu«c und^r any out Uie oi«ar&lt;aat &lt;5irou»swno«8 i wftea actual satlyfautory prooJT oi' tn« i.oas ifo fort nooning j tn^ issue of a n«w jtftRsyort to British inaian suoJ«cts ia erfi^a, and to;- &lt;.A)* araat a Nationality viertific^ta to tnoae wno intend to in the country, ana ax i4ier^enoy certificate for the single journey to Xmia to thofo who wish to return to th t country, ana ^ V3)« ?o report the oircu'n^ tuners to vae If flee of Isuue of tne lost passport, in India, ana the authorities ox the holder’s home district.

Sir, I have the honour to report that on or about 23rd September, one BAHMAN - , a Persian of Yezd applied at His Majesty^ Vice-Consulate Zahidan for a visa for India. He stated that he owned a coffee-shop in India. As nothing was known about him at Zahidan he was, as is customary, informed that a reference would have to be made to the locality in India where he stated he was known. He was told that a telegram would be sent if he were willing to defray the cost, otherwise the reference would be made by post. He declined to pay for a telegram and objected to a reference being made to India, being apparently under the impression (which impression appears also to be shared by some Persian officials) that the Police exit he had obtained at iezd automatically entitled him to a British visa. He complained to the local Governor, who telegraphed to the Governor-General at Meshed. The latter demanded from His Majesty*s Consul General at Meshed a written statement as to why a visa had been withheld. On reference to me I requested His Majesty’s Consul-General » to reply to the effect that a reply would be furnished to the Governor at Zahidan if desired, since it appeared to me most undesirable that, in addition to dealing with the local Governors, we should be required to enter into correspondence with Persian Officials who are outside the Sistan Consulate area. It was obviously open to the Consul-General to instruct the Governor at Zahidan as to any procedure he should take, and to refer to Tehran for the matter to be taken up with His Majesty* s Legation, if not satisfied. Meanwhile His Majesty* s Vice-Consul at Zahidan who had similarly been asked to give his explanation inin writing, had referred to me for instructions, and the applicant for a visa having thought better of the matter had paid for a telegram to be despatched to India* The result of this enquiry has not yet been reported to me, but from the manifest reluctance of the applicant to assist in expediting the reference, 1 shall not be at all surprised if the reply received indicates him to be an undesirable person to enter India* That references in such cases are necessary is borne out by the quite recent case of another traveller from ¥ezd who desired to proceed to Calcutta, and with regard to whom the authorities there telegraphed that a visa should be withheld as he was loiown to be of bad character. it seemed to me desirable that the situation should be m&amp;de clear to the local Governor without delay, I instructed His majesty^ Vice-Consul at Zahidan to reply in the sense of the attached draft, of which I trust you will approve. It seemed necessary firstly to make it clear that the demand for a written statement w&amp;s unusual, lest Persian Bfficials should remain under the impression that His Majesty’s Consular- Officers are under their orders, secondly that Persian Police exit visas have no bearing on the grant of a visa for British territory, and thirdly that we should not be invariably prepared to state our reasons for withholding a visa in future, the right to do so being indisputably our own affair. I have reported the matter at length, as it would appear that a complaint has been made to .the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. a copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India and to His Majesty's Consul-General- i at ileshed.

The applicant is unknown to this Vice-Consulate and it was necessary for me to make a reference to a place where he w£s known to ascertain if he be a fit person to receive a visa. .%s he declined to defray the cost of a telegram it was necessary for him to wait until the receipt by me of a reply to a reference made in the post. There is nothing new in this procedure. Eventually on September 29th the applicant realising that delay was inevitable, requested my office to send a telegram on his behalf, which has been done. I would point out that there appears to be some mis apprehension on the part of travellers, regarding the Police Exit permits, many of them being under the impression that such a permit from the Persian authorities entitles them to a British visa. I would take this opportunity of pointing out that the Police Exit Permit is a matter of purely domestic concern in Persia and has no bearing whatever on the grant of a British visa, which is given or withheld, solely at the discretion of H.h* Consular Officers according to whether the applicant he, or be not, considered a fit person to enter British territory.territory* Hiis being so r I regret that it will not always be possible for me to enter into correspondence&gt; in future, in respect of any individual whose vis&amp; may be refused on grounds which appear to me adequate.

A.D.L.Cater, Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan* Copy to His Majesty’s Consul, be is tan.The Road and Railway f ment of India are aware, is at Kok Kundi ana xnence uu Mirjawa, a distance of eightysix miles, tne journey i- performed by road. This road passes through the most desolate country imaginable, -'rom i;ok Kundi to Juzzak, a distance of about seventy miles, it is either a sandy or a i stony plain without water or vegetation and not a living creature can be seen* The road alternates oetween stretches of hard stony surface and soft sand. Over tne latter the surface has now become appalling; in many places there x are ruts a foot deep and the general state of the road may be deduced from the fact that our average speed in a light motor car was between ten and twelve miles an hour* It can only be a c^uestion of a weeks before the road becomes impassable even in dry weather and it can be predicted with certainty that this will happen at latest an the occurrence of the first winter rains, probably this month or next. 2. At the present time, there is t^uite a considerable trade between India and Rast Persia even with a lead to railhead of about one hundred and forty miles by road between ITok Kundi and Rahldan* Cn the way oac^ from Mir}awa we must have passed at least twelve nsa/il^y laa, n lorries and I am told there is an average of from six to ten proceeding both ways every day. When the road gives out, as it must shortly do, it is inevitable that this trade will come to an end and a further result will be that the is tan Consulate will be entirely cut off from India by this route. It must also put an end to the trading operations of the Anglo Persian Cil Company in EastBast Persia with the result that the Russians will entirely capture this market. It is not known what attitude the Government of India would adopt towards these possibilities but apart from the inconvenience of the severance of the Consulate from India, it would seem a great pity that the valuable Indian trade and the sale of Anglo Persian Oil Company products in 21ast Persia should come to an abrupt end. Assuming that these factors do weigh with the Government of India the solution seems to be to carry on the railway service at least as far as Koh-i-Taftan station which is only about twelve miles from Mirjawa, and between the two places there is hard surface on which the road could be maintained without difficulty. It is believed that the Railway authorities are opposed to making Koh-i- Taftan the terminus, chiefly on account of the water difficulty. Exactly the same difficulty is felt at Kok Kundi but of course to a less degree. The alternative would be to construct a good metalled road from ilok Kundi to Iv$rjawa but the expense of this would probably be prohibitive, as it may be roughly estimated at not less than ten to fifteen lakhs of rupees. To this must be added interest charges and cost of maintenance. On the score of expense it is a question of balancing the cost of maintaining and operating over the Hok Kundi l-irjawa section of the Railway against the cost of constructing and maintaining a metalled road. There is also for consideration the effect on the volume of trade of the cost of the two different methods of transport. A further point for consideration is whether the continuance of the railway service to Koh-i-Taftan would affect the negotiations which, according to Press reports, are proceeding between the British and Persian Governments regarding the reopening ofor four levies there at once. The fort has for some time been in a state of disrepair but part of it is quite habitable by levies and the rest Ox it could oe put in order at small cost. 'Jfh&amp;h I would propose is x that the frontier Assistant who now resides at Llrjawc* should live in this fort with a few policemen and levies and should examine all passports of travellers oy road there. This proposal has several advantages (a) The Frontier Assistant will be living in British instead of Persian territory to which the Persians are bound sooner or later to raise objection. (to) A telephone can be installed in the Fort from which he can communicate with our posts and other people without being dependent, as at present, on the good offices of the Persians in allowing him to use their telephone exchange at Mirjawa where, of course, every conversation can be overheard (c) It will constitute an excellent first check on travellers from Persia and if a second control I v * is maintained, as at present, at Pok Kundi and every traveller whose papers have not been stamped at Killa Sufaid is turned back from there, I am of opinion that this would form a sufficient and effective barrier against the entry of undesirable characters from Persia. (d) kuch characters, if detected at Killa Sufaid, will be turned back immediately on the frontier and thus all the expense and trouble of returning them from Kok Kundi or from the much more distant point of Sheikh Wasjiil, would be saved.The Kalat btate will, I presume, have their own checking station at Sheikh V/asil as already proposed and we might perhaps post one man there from the Quetta xolj.ce as an additiona/1 precaution. Delimitation of the frontier. 5. It appears from the examination of the actual area that, provided we take a firm stand against any ridiculous claims by the Persian Government, the extent of the debatable frontier is very small indeed and is limited to the fixation of one particular point, namely, the place where the Mirjawa and Talab rivers join. The area in dispute is in fact so insignificant that it is not worth while our quarrelling about it unless the Persians raise the question, and if they do, and provided again that care is taken to limit the demarcation to this ami small area, it should be a trifling affair which could be settled in a week or two by a small Boundary Commission. 6. I am sending a copy of this report to the Consul, be istan who I believe will be in general agreement with its contents. Sd.

I gather that the sole ground for rejection of this proposal (&amp; there are strong grounds in iV’s favour to which I will allude hereafter) is that the Persian Foreign Ministry, in their letter 8439/310122 of 20/7/31, to His Majesty's Legation, objected to our exercising control on Persian soil. 3. I believe this objection to have been based on £x informa- tion afforded by one of the Persian Consuls in India, who pass ed through Zahidan.lt seems that this official failed to acauaint himself fully with the facts, or to ascertain the views of the local Persian officials at Zahidan. 4* The preliminary examination of passports at Zahidan is carried out in co-operation with the Persian authorities, who derive considerable assistance from us -viz (a) The 'Examined' stamp (For which it was proposed to substitute 'Permitted to cross the frontier') is not affixed to the passport until the holder produces his Persian 'Exit' visa. This contitutes the only effective check the Persian have withoutwittiout it, numlDers of travellers wouli leave ttie country with out # exit f visas. (h) When •Examined*, the passport is passed to the Oustoras authorities, 'by whom it is returned to the holder. This ensures that the baggage of the traveller passes the Customs.Again, without our assistance the Persians would have difficulty in exercising control. It is therefore obvious that local arrangements are to the mutual advantage of the Persians and ourselves. They are also really in the travellers* interests, for it frequently occurs that, on presenting the passport for examina tion, they learn for the first time of the necessity of - 1. Obtaining a Persian exit visa, 2. Of passing their baggage through Zahidan Customs. as a result of which information they avoid being turned back, or at least delayed &amp; inconvenienced at the frontier. The traveller also has the satisfaction of knowing that his papers are in order. Without such preliminary examination travellers would frequently be turned back from India-for many of them are illiterate and ignorant of passport requirements-after perform ing a considerable part of their journey. 5. The objection raised by the Persian foreign Office (who ais doubtless ignorant of the advantages of the existing system to their own officials at Zahidan) appears to be based on the erroneous presumption that such control is contrary to Inter national procedure. I believe that I am correct in saying that, by mutual arrangement between the countries concerned, control by the officials of one country, is fairly frequently exercised within the territory of another. I can however cite one instance, to which my attention has been drawn, in which the circumstances are similar to those at Zahidan - viz at VENTIMICxLIA - well within the frontiers of Italy - the French check passports - beyond that place travellers witaout satisfactory* satisfactory documents cannot proceed. Ttie conditions are very similar to those on the wushki line-that is to say-there is no Station situated exactly on the frontier, it is 'better that travellers 'be discouraged from undertaking a fruitless journey, than that they l)e allowed to proceed some distance over the frontier, only to he turned hack, which must inevitably sometimes occur in the absence of a preliminary examination of their travel documents. 6. At the Quetta Conference, both the Police Authorities and the Intelligence Officer, stressed the importance of our supply ing, from Zahidan, early intimation of the intention of an un desirable, or suspect, person to cross the frontier into India. This can only be done if we have an opportunity at Zahidan of seeing the passports of travellers &amp; stamping them 'Per- mitted to cross the frontier* as an indication that their hold- ers have been seen. Without such early intimation, the police cannot arrange to supervise the movements of suspects after they have entered India. Late information is generally useless,for the individual cannot be traced-possibly for months. In this connection it must be borne in mind that many suspects are British Indians, who cannot be refused admittance to India, &amp; by reason of their not requiring a visa, do not produce their passports for examination at Zahidan. The proposal that a 11 passports should require the stamp 'Permitted to cross the frontier* was made with particular reference to such in dividuals, whose movements could then be unobtrusively watched. Here again, the insistence on examination of the passports of British Indian travellers proceeding to India, would not be without advantage to the Persians. We could require the travell er to produce the Persian 'exit* visa before stamping his passport. This would to some extent put a stop to occurrencees,which are becoming more frequent, and which are detrimental both to PersiansPersians &amp; Indians — I refer to Indians who, without of course obtaining an •exit* visa* abscond to India evading their liabilities to Persians &amp; Indians alike* They cannot be extradited &amp; do not possess property in Persia which can be attached® It is doubtless such occurrencies which give rise to the restrictive regulations regarding the movements of foreigners in Persia and which cause the Courts to demand heavy security from and to restrict the movements of, Indians involved in litigation# All of which restrictions are causes of inconvenience to the law- abiding communityo There remains the question of the search of persons suspected of carrying into India undesirable documents - acting as revolutionary agents# The Zahidan •examination* would enable ini o mat ion ol the approach of such persons to be given. But under existing regulations the Police in Baluchistan cannot search such persons® It was to enable such search to be made, when necessary, that the Conference proposed that the Barrier to be erected in Baluchistan be designated 'Passport &amp; Customs, or Excise, Barrier,' since under the Customs &amp; Excise Laws search is legal® It appears from para 2. of Government of India Despatch 274~ N/20 of July 6th, to the address of the don* ole the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, that this proposal has also not been approved of* I am of opinion that the two proposals -1* Examination at Zahidan Sc 2® Power of search at the Barrier - are of such importance that without such arrangements the control, which it was the desire of the quetta Conference to strengthen, will be inelfectual# I believe that this view is held by the Intelligence and Police authorities in Baluchistan® The need for a properly constituted control post in India is not affected by the •Examination* at Duzdap (Zahidan)® The *checx hitherto carried out at Mirjawa, was useless, in that no action could be taken on Persian soil® TheThe power to •search* or to hold up persons who avoid the Zahidan •examination* or whose documents are otherwise not in order, can only be exercised on Indian territory, tut the information on which action is taken must, in almost all cases, be furnished from Zahidan* I have the honour to suggest that, in view of the above explanations, and particularly in view of the advantage to the Persians of the preliminary examination at Zahidan and the fact that their objection to such examination on Persian soil as being contrary to International custom, appears to be based on incorrect information, the matter should be further considered, and the possibility of securing Persian agreement to our proposal to mark ‘Permitted to cross the frontier • on passports examined at Zahidan, be discussed* Copies of this despatch are being forwarded to the Charge d’Affaires, His Majesty*s Legation Tehran, and to the Hon*ble the Agent to the Governor•General in Baluchistan* I have the honour to be* Sir, Your most obedient servant, 3d/- C.

As they had been hitherto employed no extra expense would be incurred* On the other hand the post of Checking clerk at kirjawa becomes surplus and I recommend that it be abolished as soon as the new control has been established. Similarly the services of one peon can be dispensed with. This will effect an economy of Rs.100 per mensem pay of Checking clerk and Rs*35/- per mensem for the peon.

Owing to the closure of the Duzdap Railway beyond Nok Kundi the following modifications in the proposals of the conference held in Quetta last December appear necessary 1. The location of the barrier which, it is noted, is to be styled 'Passport Control Barrier* should be at Nok Kundi as long as the terminus of the Railway remains there. It will not be necessary to build quarters for the accommodation of the Barrier staff at Nok Kundi as sufficient buildings already exist ! there. 2. The barrier will be manned by the Police guard which is already stationed at Nok Kundi with the addition of one Sub Inspector, who will be detailed for the purpose by the Superintendent of Police, quetta.

It is not considered that there will he any difficulty in persuading the Kalat State , authorities to agree to this post and it is hoped that they will also agree to hear the cost of the personnel required for this purpose# This# however# is being verified# 4# IX The conference originally proposed that the Frontier Assistant Mirjawa should he abolished and his place taken ty a junior clerk# In viev/ oi the altered situation brought about by the closure of the railway beyond Nok Kundi it is now considered that for the present at any rate the Frontier Assistant, Mirjawa, should be retained# iiok Kundi unlike Koh-i«Taftan is situated at a considerable distance from the frontier and suspects or undesirables who are stopped at the barrier will now have to be transported for a distance of about 85 miles to Uirjawa by lorry. As many of these individuals are without funds it will be necessary to transport them at Government expense and it is requested that sanction may be accorded to such expenditure being met from Government funds. 2 the above modifications and those contained in your letter Ho. 1.274-H/SO, dated the 6th July 1931 I consider that the passport barrier should be instituted at once at Rok Kundi subject to its being moved later should the terminus of the railway be changed.

The number of Aignan subjects who entered Persia via Meshed and who obtained visas or entry into India from this Consulate General wgs 12 in April, 26 in May and 29 for the xaeriod from 1st to loth June. As preliminary enquiries are made by this Consulate General before grant of vice it is possible thpt many more Afghans who either could not spare their time or had good re-sons known to themselves for avoiding scrutiny left for Zahedan without applying here for visas. There is a route from Herat via Karez direct to Birjand and another one from Herat to Birjand, which crosses the Persian frontier near tire small Customs post Ahwaz, which I believed are followed by many Afghan subjects who do not call at Meshed. This Consulate General possesses better facilities than the * Zahedan Vice-Consulate for checking antecedents but naturally, although it has the assistance of its Afghan colleague, cannot vouch for all Afghans apply!ng for vis s 0 If this Consulate General is not satisfied it either refuses a visa or in the case of a transit vis'~ specifies the route by wrier the journey should be completed.AI I support Major Daly’s su.^sstior, that Ai, ; hans w;io s Vjr • i j t m * r . -t- Per sicr 'by ths K}icrr&gt;s?n route should be r oquirecl go oo o- m n ^ Meshs-d visas coverinj their str;/ in India. li a visa is r.jiufiea they have the alternatives of applying to His Majesty s Representative at Kabul or Kandahar, The recent appointment of a British Consul at Kandahar should ease matters for inhabitants of Soutnern and western Afghanistan, who otherwi so might have been compelled to incur hardship in getting a visa from Hi s Maj esty ’ s Representative at Kabul, but as the Meshed route from Herat to India is prei erred by m^ny it should not be altogether denied to them if they are prepared to take the risk of having their visas refused by this Consulate General. Persons who obtain visas from the British Consul at Kandahar would normally prefer to enter British territory via Chaman, but I consider that if for any re-son theg should present themselves at Zalledan the visa they hoid sheuld, as a 1 so should any visa issued by this Consulate General? be considered sufficient. The use of the North- West Prontier route should not in these cases be insisted on? thougr.

Afghans frequently apply at His Majesty’s Vice-Consul Zahi dan (Du zdap) for transit to Af ghani stan via - (1) Quetta and Chaman. ( 2 ) Peshawar. t e We have no means of checking the bona fides of such applicant the majority of wh 0 m have c 0 me in from Western 0 r IT 0 rthern Afghanistan. t Although the route to be followed and the duration of stay in India are specified on their passports, I gather that the Baluchistan police have no real authority to insist on the conditions of the visa being carried out. In the event of a Foreign power desiring 10 despatch to India emissaries of Afghan nationality, who might be known at the Frontier and be refused admission to India, it is at present extremely easy for them to gain admittance on a ’transit vi s a ’ vi a Zahi dan. There seems no valid reason why Afghans proceed ing from Persia to their own country should not proceed via one of the direct routes instead of travelling via India. Afghans, not normally resident in Persia who desire to visit India might normally proceed direct over the fronti er/There seems no necessity for such travellers to proceed to India via Persia.

Dated Simla, 1931 c Sir, The Government of India have had under consideration the Question of introducing a stricter system of control over the grant of visas to Afghan subjects entering India by the Zahidan route, with the view, more especially, of making entry more difficult for agents of a third Power. 2. It has been pointed out that the grant of a visa for India at Zahidan, or in fact any Consulate in Persia, to Afghans who have come straight in from Afghanistan ana are ouite unknown would enable, anyone who wished to do so to enter India without difficulty, although he might have been refused a visa at His Majesty's Legation at Kabul or one of the Consulates in Afghanistan. It has according ly been suggested that in order to enable an adeouato check to be maintained all Afghans travelling by the Zahidan route and transiting Persia en_route for India, or for their own country via India, should be required to obtain visas beforehand either from Kabul or one of the Consulates in Afghanistan, or in certain circumstances from Meshed, and that visas should be refused at Zahidan to all travellers of this nationality other than those personallypersonally known tc the issuing authority. This suggestion the Government of India dc not consider it practicable tc adopt. It would impose unjustifiable inconvenience upon a comparatively large class for the sake of a few persons and would almost certainly prove ineffective even against these, it might also cause the Afghan Government to retaliate by counter-measures designed to harass British subjects 3. The travelling or desiring to travel in Afghanistan, only precautions which appear to the Government of India to be possible are:- (a) that all Consular officers in Persia should be warned against this particular danger, vis the issue of visas for India to Afghans who might conceivably be agents cf a foreign Power; and (o) that they should in future furnish lists of all Afghans to whom visas for India have been issued by them, together with any condition prescribed in such visas, to the appropriate police authorities in India, so that the movements of the individuals concerned may be kept under observation. In addition, if the Vice-Consul at Zahidan has reason tc suspect the bona Tides of any person to whom a visa to enter India has already been granted, ho should take steps to communicate a warning to the appropriate police authority in India. 4. The Government of India desire to bring these instructions which may be regarded as supplementary to those conveyed in part 6 raph 4 of their letter Bo.F.374-N./30, dated 6th July 1931 to the particular notice of all concerned.

It will he observed that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs protested to his Majesty's Minister at Tehran on the subject in January last, and Mr. Henderson concurs in the views expressed by Sir R. Clive in his despatch No.113 of July 11th last to the Government of India. In his opinion, indeed, the proposal would nullify the purpose for which the frontier barrier is to be moved into undisputed British territory at Koh-I-Taftan, and he would further observe that it is not in fact the general usage in European countries that persons, who have obtained a visa for admission to another country, must have their passports stamped again by the officials of the country to be visited before leaving the country where the visa was obtained. In the circumstances Mr. Henderson hopes that Mr. Secretary Benn will The Under-Secretary of State India Officewill agree that the Passport Control System at Duzdap should he discontinued. 3. With reference to the recommendations 3 III (a)&gt; (t) and (c) of the Conference, it will he observed from Sir R. Clive despatch that the precautions suggested are as far as possible already taken. If any further modifications are desired Mr. Henderson presumes that the Government of India will communicate direct with His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran. 4. Mr.Henderson further wishes to draw attention to Paragraphs 5 and 6 and to the last sub-paragraph of Paragraph 4 of Sir R. Clive’s despatch. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,Copy. (T 6213/1410/378). No.195. BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN, April 28th, 1931. Sir, I have the honour to inform you in reference to your despatch No.200 (T 3430/1410/378) of the 10th April last, that in general I am in agreement with the recommendation made by the conference held at Quetta in December last to consider a reorganization of the passport control arrangements on the Perso-Baluchistan frontier. 2. My views, which still hold, on the undesirability of the continuance of a British passport control system at Duzdab (Zahedan) that is, on Persian territory, were conveyed to the Government of India in my despatch No.113 of the 11th July, 1930, a copy of which I now enclose. 3. My anticipation of Persian objections to this control eventtn^lly materialised in a note from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No.8439/310122 of the 20th January last, a copy of which I enclose, and a copy of which was sent to the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India under Printed Letter No.6 of the 26th idem. 4. As regards recommendations made under paragraph 3 (iii) (a), (b) , (c). As far as possible the urecautions suggested are already in practice. Under existing Persian regulations governing foreign exchange it is not always possible for travellers to produce Bank drafts and letters of credit, but every effort is and will continue to be made to ensure that persons wishing to transit India are not likely to become a charge on the The Right Honourable Government.

Any reduction thereof is a matter for the Government of India to decide. As regards recommendation 3 (iii) preferable that the reference for a visa in the circumstances mentioned should, in general, as at present, continue to be made to the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India except, at discretion, by those Consulates, under the direct superintendence of the Government of India, on the Khorasan and Sistan borders. With reference to paragraph 2 (iii) of the report of the proceedings I was also unaware that persons applying for a visa for entry into Persia from India were required to make 250 a deposit of Rupees two hundred and fifty and I am causing enquiries to be made on this matter. 6. Under the existing Persian passport and visa regulations persons entering Persia are required to produce evidence 100 that they are in possession of one hundred Tomans (about ten pounds sterling). 7# 1 am forwarding a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, etc. it would seem (Sgd). R. H. CLIVE.Copy. No.113. BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN, July 11th, 1930. Sir, I have the honour to invite your attention to your Majesty f a Consul for Sistan and Kain a nd to previous correspondence on the subject of the endorsement of passports at Duzdap by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at that post. 2. This system of passport control appears originally to have been instituted by the Government of India in 1923 (vide despatch No. 658/696-M of the 30th May of that year to the honourable the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan), at a time when the Vice-Consulate at Duzdap appears to have been under the control of that Administration. .3. I beg leave to enquire whether it is still considered necessary by the Government of India to maintain this system of control at Duzdap, whereby Persian and other travellers, already in possession of valid British Consular visas furnished in other parts of Persia, are required to undergo further formalities at His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Duzdap before being allowed to proceed on their journey. 4. The objections to the continuance of this system seem to me to be two-fold, viz:- (l) In reality it serves no useful purpose because (a) where a visa has been obtained from some other Consular post the Vice Consul at Duzdap is not ordinarily in a position to cancel that visa and (b) the Vice Consul at Duzdap is ordinarily less competent to judge the bona fides or undesirability of the holder than the The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, SIMLA.the officer who has issued the visa. In fact it is, I 'believe, the frequent practice of the Vice Consul at Duzdap, to refuse to issue a visa to a Persian who has arrived from some other province, on the grounds that he should apply for his visa in the province where he is known and where there is a British Consular Officer. (2) It is open to objection by the Persian Government that a British Indian frontier control point should be instituted on Persian territory, and they have in point of fact recently questioned the existing arrangement, though their information was faulty. Moreover I do not consider it desirable that one of His Majesty’s Vice-Consuls in Persia should be called upon to usurp the functions of a British Indian frontier control officer and thus on occasion to stultify or‘render nugatory the visa of another Consular Officer in Persia. Such a function would more properly be vested in a Passport Control Officer carrying out his duties on Indian territory; or conceivably on the Persian side of the frontier., e.g. at Mirjawa by a special arrangement between the two Governments similar to that which exists on many European land frontiers. 5.

Monsieur le Charge d*Affaires, In reply to the note No.99 (199?) of Khurdad 22nd (June 12th, 1930) signed hy His Excellency Sir Clive in connection with the actions taken hy the honourable British Vice-Consulate at Duzdap in connection with the visa of passports of Persian subjects, I have the honour to state that according to the information received, the said Vice-Consul is examining the passports of all the travellers to India which are duly visaed by other officials of the British Government even in the diplomatic passports of individuals and signs (gives a visa on) the passports of the travellers, puts a number and date on them and seals them with a seal bearing the word ’’examined”. In case a traveller rightly refuses or fails to produce his passport, the Passport Inspectors, who are examining the passports of travellers at the first frontier place of British Baluchistan, will cause inconvenience to the said traveller. Apart from the inconvenience and'delay which are caused to travellers by such action, in view of the fact that Duzdap and Mirjawa form parts of Persian territory and that examination of the passports of Persian subjects within Persian territory by the officials of another Power in contrary to the usage and practice in force, I shall be obliged if you would be so good as to cause the British authorities residing in Persia to abstainabstain from such actions and that the examination of passports of travellers (going) to India may, according to the usual practice, be made at the frontier places which are situated within British Baluchistan and India.

I do not see why a per sen applying at Duzdapj lor a transit visa to Kandahar (for instance) should be required to travel via Peshav.ar instead of by Quetta and Chaman. fb) It is apparently proposed that an Afghan from Herat, vhose antecedents cannot be checked at Neshed, vdien applying for a visa to India should be tola to go to India via the N.N.F.P. This means that he would have to return 200 miles to Herat, and from there set out on an odyssey of either 500 miles by the difficult ENCLOSURE IN WDiA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter i ^ 0 35 m, Dated 1 C MR. 193] Received 6 APR. 1931 jHazarajat route or 700 via Kandahar in order to reach Kabul on his uay to India *by a recognised route via K«¥.F.P. rhere control exists.” Having reached Kabul ho\ ever he would find that there v.as nothing to prevent him entering India without a visa by the Kurrum route. 5. The difficulty of dealing with suspects from Northern Afghanistan is a very real one but I cannot see that the ^resent proposals, so far as I understand them, would do anything to solve it. 4. One result in my opinion which their adoption would certainly have would be retaliation on the part of the Afghan Government for the amount of incon venience thereby caused to innocent travellers of Afghan nationality. 5. Duzdap is, I understand, one of the very few places where local conditions make it practically impossible for any traveller to India to escape scrutiny; and for this reason, even though check of an applicant’s antecedents may be very difficult there - as it is elsewhere - it would in my opinion be inadvisable to prohibit the issue of visas to India altogether at Duzdap, and thereby compel undesirables to use o the reroutes where they can enter India without any risk of detection.

(4) Any^other matters connected with the above which might come These subjects have been dealt with in the above order in the proceedings and recommendations made under each. As I mvself was r.rXni 'f Vr! conference and agree with these recommendations I shall confine myself now to commentmg on a few points which the context may not make sufficiently 3. The officers present considered that the existing arrangements for checking passports are most unsatisfactory and were unanimous!; of opinion that it is a matter of great‘mportance that they should be improved forth' with. It has been suspected for some time that the Duzdap route offers an easy method of entering India to undesirables who are anxious to avoTd any careful scrutiny of their persons or their passports and this suspicion has been greatly strengthened by the discussion which took place at the confer! cnee. It was felt, however, that no real improvement in the present arrangements could be expected as long as the checking staff remained on Persian sod and the conference has, therefore, recommended their transfer to Koh-i-faftan, which is believed to be indisputably in British territory and from Where, with the co-operation of the Railway authorities, thev ca operate the proposed barrier at the frontier with little difficulty Koh i Taftan station is at present closed, but the Divisional Superintendent, North Western Railway, with whom I have discussed the question, informs me that it would be a simple matter to an ange to stop trains there, to rail out the necessary supply of drinking water for the staff and to provide quarters for them, should it be decided to put these proposals into effect. The erection nf the barrier which the conference proposes to place at the border, with a shed for the protection of the staff and passengers is not expected to cost more tha« a few hundred rupees, While the subsidiary checking station for motor vch.des at Dalbanam will involve an expenditure of some Rs. 500 (rupees ; fiye hundred).. Detaffed estimates for these items and for the quarters for th? staff at Koh-i-Taftan station will, however, be submitted if the suggestions of the conference are considered to be workable. 3 4 * * * 8 4. In referring to the barrier as a “ Passport a n d Customs (or excise! barrier it was not the intention of the conference to suggest that a.!,, regular customs or excise examination should be held at the frontier It was considered necessary that the staff there should have power to searrh any individual known or suspected to be carrying seditious literature and in the opinion of those present the simplest manner of conferring such power was in connection with a nominal customs or excise examination1 5. As regards the intelligence work, I agree with the conference in considering that the Frontier Assistant can we e Kg ^ removed clerk stationed at Koh-i-Taftan ; and that Faiz Gul should also De re n c there from Mirjawa, confining his future activities strictly to mtelligence work under the Quetta Bureau. , 6. The conference considered it necessa,ry to take ° ^ e which far as possible the entry into India by Duzdap of seditious Uterature which there is reason to believe is now being occasionally sent in by this roi t To establish a regular censorship of the Persian mails would be a task o some magnitude, involving considerable expense could not well be justified at the moment, nor does the situation a^ ar to demand the introduction of such a measure. At the same “ diti . felt that, should it be ascertained that any particular mail contamed sod t ous matter, steps should be taken to prevent t is rea- mg isog this in India. Under section 26 (1) of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, this Administration would appear to have power to order the intercep ion o ny particular mail and, this being so, no further authority for this purpose seems required. 1. Conference — On December 13th, 1930 a conference was convened at Quetta to consider the means by which improvements can be effected in the Pas&amp;port Checking arrangements on the Indo-Persain Frontier; more effective control exercised over the entry of undesirables and vagrants into British India from Persia ; and certain other allied subjects. The following officers were present at the Conference :— The Hon’ble Lt.-Col. C. E. Bruce, C.S.I., C.LE., C.B.E., Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan. Major C. K. Daly, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan and Kain. Lt.-Col. C. T. C. Plowden, Political Agent, Kalat. ' Lt.-Col. S. Williams, Political Agent, Chagai. Mr. A. J. O’Connor, Superintendent of Police, Quetta. Major P. A. Meade, M. C., Intelligence Officer in Baluchistan, Quetta. Captain L. Steveni, O.B.E., M.C., Military Attache, Meshed. Captain C. E. G. Hope, Adjutant, Mekran Levy Corps. 2. Existing arrangements. (i) Passport checking arrangements .—The present arrangements at Duzdap for granting visas for entry into British India, for checking passports, and for controlling the movements of un desirable immigrants are open to objection by the Persian ^ Government, and have actually been subject to objections (J from them. (ii) Visas are frequently granted at Cousular Offices in Persia to persons desirous of entering British India, although nothing is known at those offices of the desirability, or otherwise, from the point of view of the Government of India, of such persons being permitted to enter British India. (iii) At present no person can enter Persia from India without a Persian Consular Visa, and without making a deposit of Rs. 250 with the application for Visa. There is no such arrangement existing in the case of persons wishing to enter British India irom Persia, only a visa being necessary, the financial statusJL of such persons being not called into question. The result is that the Quetta police have constantly on their hands foreign ers, without visible means of subsistence, who ave ° V. tained and eventually repatriated very often at considerable (iv) Transit Visas issued at present to persons wishing to enter British India extend for 15 days which is fa: too long, and no route specified. 3 Recommendations. The Conference made the following recommendations (i) Passport and Customs (or Excise) L'arner.- A flustoms (or Excise) fin* oWSr, S i? ^ttnX should be manned by the existing personnel available at Mirjawa. 1 Police Inspector, 1 Clerk, 1 Police Havildar and 4 constables, 1.

As far as the pay of personnel i~erned there will { be - cost to Government but quarters wdl Wmntier At this point in the Taftan and an Examining ^XlfsfLSdng and checking the passport desert there should t&gt;e no diffi&gt; y chec g king an d search could be done of, every passenger ’ r acv than at a crowded railway station. s s. »«a- &gt;“«“”» u » m ” i » ! ^Ivanta.es . ^ on Frontier it is not liable to objertion by the {a) pf r tfa„ Government, as it would be, if it were placed, for in- stance at Miriawa, where the Parsian Government have already objected to proposals for establishing a joint passport pos* ,,, TV „, ' na triation of undesirable or vagrant immigrants will oe (6) vcfv much simplified, as it will only be necessary to refuse such uersons admission past the barrier ; and the difficulty of the rt—rd 6 r^iatriation'^of f vagrant T^Sia^ immigrants. If! , the fact of the Earner personnel residing within British India (d) tne iacr o , { ca nnot be open to objection by the p“stn Government as would be the case if they stayed at Miijawa. / \ T 3 arr ieT will enable a far closer watch and check to be kept, (e) The ® an h hitherto been possible, on all persons entering British India by train from Persia and to some extent on people enter ing by car, for which latter case provision is made in later suggestions. 7 Pndinners —Persons using the motor road from («) Che ^ ft™ Cannot be completely controlled at the Frontier Barrier, Duzdap t0 ^ e ^ a t h; country enables anybody, if he so wishes, to evade as the nature of th The conference therefore suggest that Ks^ss&amp;ss&amp;t. ««o aoum b,« B b S ,h,d« Dalbandin.4 Kalat State, Co-operation. —Kalat State are equally concerned in keeping out undesirables, and they will undertake, if approached, to establish a checking post over that portion of the road which passes through Kalat territory, the position of the post being decided by them. {til) Visas Granted to Foreigners by Consular Officers. —Strong represen tation should be made by the Government of India to the British Legation at Tehran on the following points :— (а) That any foreigner wishing to obtain a visa to enter British India or any British subject applying for permission to cross the frontier from Persia must invariably obtain it from the Consular Post of that area of Persia in which he has been residing, or is otherwise known to the Consular Officer. This will normally be the area in which he has been granted the Persian exit visa. (б) Transit \ isas .—That measures be taken to guard against persons obtaining transit visas becoming stranded in India for want of funds. No visa should normally be granted unless the applicant can produce a bank draft on India for not less than Rs. 250. (Note. The Persian Consul at Quetta demands similar proofs of possession of funds from persons travelling through Persia.) The above applies to transit visas. In the case of foreigners who apply ^ or a visa for India for a period in excess of the duration of the transit visa, it should be incumbent on the Consular Authority concerned to satisfy himself that the applicant has means of subsistence in India, and is not likely to become a vagrant. (c) That the scope of transit visas should be greatly curtailed—eight days is suggested—and that the route to be travelled over should be clearly specified in the passport. It is not desirable that every person entering India from Persia on a transit visa should be able to halt at will at Quetta or any other important place en route. The direct route to India from Duzdap is via Spezand, where the Railway connections are now suitable. (d) That in every case of a person wishing to enter India from Persia he must obtain a stamped permission to enter on his passport as is the general usage between European countries, and in particular, to quote a specific analogous case, between India and Afghanistan at Chaman. This stamp will be applied at Duzdap, the nearest important towm to the Frontier where proper information regarding prospective immigrants can be obtained, and effective observation and check on undesirables maintained. The stamping of “ per mission to cross the Frontier ” at Duzdap also allows a re-check to be made at the Frontier Barrier, which will make it still more difficult for undesirables to enter that way. (e) That in cases where reliable information concerning an applicant for a British Consular visa in Persia is not available to the Consular authorities concerned, they should make enquiries from the Superintendent of Police, Quetta, before granting a visa. {iv) Liaison between Seistan and Quetta PoZzcc.—Liaison {between His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan and the Quetta Police could be more effectively maintained, if some arrangement could be come to with the North Western Railway regarding the sending of free messages m certain eases which the Consul, Seistan may consider necessary, when the despatch of a message by normal routes, i.e., by the Persian Telegraphs would not be advisable. Such cases will not occur very frequently.5 i o 4. Intelligence. . , ^ e ^ 0 . rj ^ e J' c J nce consider that the co-ordinatiou of intelligence duties • es p° am ®d hy the mutual co-operation of the Departments concerned, °r ’ Intelligence Bureau and His Majesty’s Consul, Seistan ; f 18 k e ^ er there should be some overlapping rather than water- i'. c ® ni P aa ‘tment; and that any specific, orders and regulations, however e astic tor the co-ordination of Intelligence work and information are not likely to have the desired results. The Conference suggest, however :— {i) That the post of Frontier Assistant should be eliminated, being icplaced by a selected English-speaking and writing Junior Assistant at Koh-i-Taftan. (n) That the Passport Checking Clerk at Mirjawa (Faiz Gul), should not continue in his present capacity, but reside at Koh-i- Taftan, be completely under the orders of the Intelligence Officer at Quetta, and confine himself solely to Intelligence work. {iii) That Mahmud Gul should be seconded from the Police cadre of Baluchistan for service in the Political Department, and continue as at present on the Seistan Cadre. In the event of these measures being carried into effect His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, will be able to surrender Rs. 1,200 annually, which saving can be set off against the expense of the Barrier. Censorship .—The Conference further proceeded to discuss the question of censorship of letters entering India from Persia via Duzdap. A regular weekly censorship of all the mails from Duzdap would entail such a colossal amount of work as to render it almost impossible with the existing means at the disposal of the Baluchistan authorities, besides being politically undesirable. They suggest however, that the Agent to the Governor-General should be given the power to order, whenever information received or circum stances lead him to consider it advisable a thorough search and investigation of the contents of any single week’s mail from Duzdap. This investigation would be carried out at Spezand by the Intelligence Officer, and would involve no extra expense.

Sir, I have the honour to report that it has been brought to my notice that persons refused visas for Inuia at this Consulate General have proceeded to other posts where they are not known and where they have consequently been able to obtain visas unquestioned. Whenever a visa is applied for in Meshed and is refused, a warning to that effect is placed in the passport of the applicant. It now appears however that undesirables anticipating refusal in Meshed refrain from applying here. So far as the direct route to India is concerned their evasion is ineffective, as whenever a resident of Meshed or a person holding a passport issued here applies at Duzdap for a visa he is compelled to wait until written enquiry has been made concerning him or meet the cost of a reply paid telegram to this Consulate General, as a consequence I am informed that undesirables wishing to proceed to India now prefer to travel westward, with or without the pretext of undertaking e, pilgrimage to Iraq and Palestine, and to apply for visas somewhere en route. In all the circumstances you will perhaps be disposed to issue instructions for a check similar to that in force at Duzdap to be introduced in all Consular posts His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires, British Legation, TehranVP1 in Persia and to approach, the responsible authorities in Iraq and Palestine for their co-operation in the same sense• I have sent a copy of this despatch to the Foreign • Secretary of the Government of India*i. c*i*i &lt;&gt;i (t* ^T° H* 'rJZTZfkj. &lt;■ t Ho. 213. 0- 'l/*' A**-*'* jBRITXSH LEGaTIOH, i9 30 j TEHRAff, 16th October, 1930.

Under reciprocal arrangements, the equivalent charge for a British visa to Persian subjects is ten Gold francs, which at the current rate of exchange amounts to approximately Krans twenty four, which sum is, in fact, now being calculated for such visas by British Consular Representatives. 3. The fee charged by the Persian Consul at Quetta would appear, therefore, to be some what excessive, and I have the honour to request Your Highness to be so good as to inform me whether the enhanced fee has now been laid down by the Persian Government.

Complaint againfct the Persian Consul, Karachi, In connection with - 0 O 0 The Commissioner in Sind has the honour to bring the following facts to the notice of Government *- Under the Rules and Orders issued by the Persian Government governing the entry of Foreign Subjects into Persia, Foreign subjects who wish to enter Persia have to satisfy the Persian Consular Authorities that they are in possession of Es. 300/- before they can have their passports visaed. Complaints were received ty the Commissioner in August 1929 from British subjects that the Persian Consul at Karachi required exorbitant sums in cash to be deposited before a visa was given. In one case it was reported that as much as Es. 5,000 was required, while in another case the applicants were asked to deposit Es. 1,000/-. The British Consul, 'lohammerah, also wired at the time enquiring whether the Persian Consul at Karachi was demanding cash security from each person desiring to enter Persia. The Persian Consul, Karachi, was therefore asked by the Commissioner tio state wiietner tnis was a fact. In reply he merely stated that he was obliged to use all possible means to prevent undesirable foreigners entering Persia. It was then pointed out to him that British passports are issued to persons for Persia only after it has been ascertained that such persons have obtained regular employment in Persia or, in the case of traders, that they are in possession of sufficient funds, and that passports are not issued to persons whose character is doubtful. Further, itit was suggested to him that he could communicate confidentially to the Commissioner if he had reason to believe that any holder of a passport was an undesirable immigrant into Persia so that thorough enquiries might be made. Just then two other written complaints were received by the Comnissioner. In one petition it was stated that a sun of Rs, 65 was taken as a bribe for granting a visa on two passports and in the second petition it was stated that the Clerk of the Consul demanded Es, 30/-* The petitioners were questioned on the point bjxt they could not produce any witnesses to substantiate the statements made by them. 'The Persian Consul finally replied in his letter Ho. 54, dated the 26th September 1929, that he would act according to the Commissioner's suggestion and that, since the receipt of the Commissioner's letter, he was granting visas on the passports of all British subjects going to Persia, -after this no further complaints were received by the Commissioner, till the receipt of letter ITo. 1922,. dated the 21st August 1930, from the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In this letter the Political Resident has brought the following case to the notice of the Commissioner s- 'A certain ruhammad Din was charged before the Political Agent, Bahrein, with entering Bahrein without being in possession of a proper visa. The man, however, produced a genuine Persian Visa for Bahrein given by the Persian Consul at Karachi. On being asked who had directed him to the Persian Consul for a visa, he replied that he had heard that some visa was required and that he fell in with an Indian barber who was goingV going to Ilohamrierah and this nan told him to come with him and that he would get what was required. This simple minded nan did so and was asiced by the Persian Consul to produce security for Es» 500/- before he could give him the visa. The man said he was unable to produce the security and finally the Consul settled the matter by charging Is# 7/- for the visa and an extra Rs. 5/- instead of security. 11 The Persian Consul was therefore again addressed in the matter and also asked to intimate to the Commissioner under what authority he issued a visa for Bahrein in the above mentioned case. He has replied as under i- M Any foreign subjects entering into Persia should have their passports visaed. Therefore I am right in issuing a visa on Muhammad Din's passport who was proceeding to Bahrein Persia, as Bahrein belongs to Persian Government. Regarding security, after my letter dated 26th September 1929, no passengers have been asked for deposit f and regarding visa charges, this Consulate charges according to monthly exchange and no body 7/ill be charged more than that • n It will be seen from the above reply that the Persian Consul denies having asked for any security etc., from the person. As regards the visa for Bahrein, the Persian Consul was presumably acting in accordance v/ith the orders of his Government, since it is understood that the Persian Government still maintain that Bahrein is a Persian and not a British possession.Confidential.

His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan, in his despatches No.290/4/6, dated the 14th July 1930 ''and No. 344/11/2. C, dated the 17th August 1930, has emphasised the unsatisfactory nature of the existing arrangements and has made certain suggestions for tneir improvement; and the British military Attache at Meshed, in a memorandum dated the 9th ptember 1930, has drawn the attention of the General Staff h d. r Lie co —: ^3' ro CD c.

So long ago as 1924 the Persian Government objected to the presence ot our Police at Duzdap. / Passport Officer at that place was. therefore designated ’’Trade Assistant 1 ' and was at tached1 - 2 - attcicneci to the Sistan Consulate staff, his ilajssty’s Minister at IMnran at the same time was auje^d to approach tnc Persian Government with a view to the establishment of a joint passport checking office at Mirjawa. The papers in tx A is connection are still under examination; but the arrangement made as a result of the objection of iQ24 still exists and it appears that the Persian Government have never recognised the Consular ’’Trade Assistant” as Passport Officer at Duzdap, nor agreed to tne establishment oi a joint passport control office at Mirjawa. 3. The question how best to effect any improvem nt in the existing system of passport control is one wnich demands a careful study of local conditions? and tnc Government of India are of opinion that ic must be considered in the first place by a conference of local officers who are directly cone, rn^d with the question and who have the requisite personal knowledge of existing conditions in the particular xrea und^r consideration. I am therefore to request that you will arrange to convene a conference of local officers for consideration of the question in all its aspects. The conference should be held at ^uetta at the earliest convenient date and, in addition to any officers of the Baluchisian Administration whom you yourself may select, it should be attended by Major C.K. Paly, C.I.E. (his M.^j ..sty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain ), Major P.a„ Meade, M.C. (Officer in charge of Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau) and Captain L. i Steveni O.B.E. , 11.C. , (British Military Attache at Meshed). The main function of the conference will be to formulate and submit to the Government of India recommendations for the improvement, if possible without additional expense, oi existing ermangements for passport control jn the Persian Erontier, for cho elimination of features to which the Persian Government might reasonably object, and for the simplification and better control of intelligence work in that area. 4. In connection with intelligence duties I am directed to state that the position and status of the 'Brontier assistant” toto the Political A^ent Chagai require special consideration, as it appears to tne Government of India that tne Persian Government might with some justification object to his presence at Mirjawa. I am also directed to state, with reference to the second paragraph of the letter from the Government of India in the Poreign and Political Department ho.D. 3646-11/30, u^ted the Pnd September i930, that Paiz Gul, tne present cneeking clerk, at M.irjawa is not to be further employed within the limits of the Sistan Consular district, if this can possibly be avoided, and if his retention in Government employ is considered necessary it should be outside these limits. 5. A form of agenda for the guidance of the conference is enclosed. I am to state, however, that this is not to be regarded as exhaustive and that the conference will be expected to consider and report upon all subsidiary questions wim ch may arise from the main points at issue. The proceedings and recommendations of the conference should be forwarded to the Government of India with your comments; and I am to request you also to communicate to the Government of India the names of the officers selected to attend the conference, and the date on which it is to be convened. 6.

Si stan and Kaln. 1 have the honour to refer to your despatch ho.7 of the 27th February, 1930 in which you call for observations on a complaint received from the Persian Ministry for foreign Affairs to the effect that his -“ajesty^ Vice- Consul at Duzdap obstructs Persian Nationals proceeding to India by delaying the grant of a visa. x beg to state that no new procedure has been intro duced at huzdap and the practice followed is that which has always existed there. xn the majority of cases Persians from the interior arrive at Duzdap with a visa obtained from the British Consul of their district, to whom they are known, or who has opportunities of discovering whether they are fit persons to enter India, un the rare occasions when tney have neglected to obtain such a visa and apply at Buzdap, nie Majesty's Vice-Consul refers to his Majesty's Consul for the district from which they have come to ascertain if there be any objection to the grant of a visa. When the applicant is willing to defray the cost such a reference is made telegraphically. The fact that the applicant is in possession of a Persian Police visa shews^ that the Persians have no objection to his leaving the country, but does not, as the Persians appear to believe, necessarily convince us that he is a desirable person to enter India. If it were to be held that His Majesty's Vice-Consul must visa passports of all who apply to him, the granting of a visa would be valueless and afford us no control over undesirable persons entering India. In fact any person who had reason to believe that he might not be granted a visa where he was known would proceed to Duzdap and obtain oneone tnere* Duzdap ‘being the ’gateway* into india from East Persia, a reasonable amount of supervision seems necessary there. no delay at all would ever be involved (and the cases in which there is now any delay extremely few) were tne Persian Government to advise their nationals to take visas from the nearest Consulate or at least to obtain a letter to elsewhere* the effect that there is no objection to the grant of a visa/ I in the case, for instance, of a Persian national known to be an agent of another power and likely to be employed in subversive propaganda or anti-British agitation, it would appear to be the duty of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul either to withhold a visa pending furtner instructions, or to report to tne Indian authorities in order that the individual might be kept under some degree of observation while in India. The complaint of tne Persian Foreign Ministry would seem unjustified - the more so when we take into consideration the extraordinary methods of their own passport officials at uuzdap. A British subject arriving by the Duzdap route, with passport duly vise by a Persian Consul, has to surrender his passport at Mirjawa. Hj^a is told that it will be returned on arrival of the train at huzdap. Further enquiry at Duzdap elicits the information that it must be recovered from the police in tne town, it is then necessary to make frequent applications to the police before the passports can be retrieved, in the case of personnel of our Consulates in East Persia, it often takes our representative a week to recover the passport- the holder has, in the meantime proceeded up country and is theoretically liable to arrest for not being in possession of a passport. Members of the general public, pilgrims etc. must fare considciaLly woitie, perhaps they tind means oi accelerating the work of the officials at the Police station, and must otten be delayed&amp; delayed for a considerable time. some time ago tne wife of the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Sistan, visited India for tv/o weeks. This lady obtained a Persian visa for the return journey at Karachi. Unfortunately she forgot her passport. On arrival at Mirjawa, she was told she should not enter Persia. Having no passport, such action was no doubt technically right, but as Jahe was well known to tne Director of Customs, Duzdap, who controls the Persian passport officials, she was allowed to proceed to Jduzdap. She was not, however, permitted to go to Sistan, although His Majesty*s Vice-Consul offered to guarantee that the passport duly vise, would be produced in due course. A proposal that the Persian Consul at Karachi be referred to telegraphically at the lady*3 expense was also not acceded to. nevertheless, after a delay of six aays she was told ahe could proceed to Sistan, although the passport had not yet arrived. x cite these examples merely to shew that the disabili** ties under which Persians may very occasionally labour, when desiring xx to enter India, are, to say the least, slight in comparison with those regularly suffered by British subjects entering Persia by the Duzdap route, and that countless occasions offer for complaints from our siae, which however, we refrain from making, since it is highly improbable that any improvement would result. The originator of the protest from the Persian Ministry, was, l understand, an Isfahani, who did not take the trouble to inform himself of tne procedure and applied for a visa on the strength of a telegram alleged to De irom the Peisian Police of Isfahan and said to establish his identity, wnich was not in question. He had failed to understand that he should have asked His Majesty*s Vice-Consul to satisty himself from His Majesty’s Consular officer at Isfahan. This individualindividual on return from India, appealed to the Governor of Khorasaan, who presumably thought the opportunity to find some fault in our passport system too good to be missed, A copy of this Despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, I have, etc., Sd/- C.

Unless and until the arrangements there can be improved, I am of opinion that the continuance of some supervision at Duzdap will be necessary. If however, as suggested in my previous despatch referred to above, a responsible official can be appointed at Mirjawa for this work, the necessity for any such supervision at Duzdap would at once 1 disappear. As there is no village or water-supply in the immediate vicinity of the frontier, other than Mirjawa, it would be necessary for this official to live at the station, which is of course considered by the Persians to be within Persian territory, although the exact location of the frontier at Mirjawa has never been determined. It would then be possible for him to examine passports there, but that, without the assistance of police, the carrying out of a proper examination is a difficult matter since the passengers cannot be controlled and it would be an easy matter for a person so desirous, to evade the Inspector. If as a result of agreement with the Persians the Railway precincts be definitely set apart for the use of the railway, it is presumed that there would be no obj ectionobjection to the presence in the station of a limited number of our railway police, who could assist in controlling the passengers while checking was in progress* I would suggest however, the following procedure, both because it would simplify passport checking and remove any possible objection by the Persians to our officials executing their functions on Persian territory. A small hut might be constructed a few hundred yards down the line, indisputably within our borders, and the checking officer, while normally living at the station, would attend there to examine passports* The train could stop there for a few minutes for the purpose and first and second class compartments could be locked on arrival of the train until passports had been checked, while third class passengers might be required to pass a small barrier, at which passports would be checked* It would then be only necessary for the police to satisfy themselves that all carriages were temporarily empty and that each passenger passes the barrier and produces his passport. The hut would be within reasonable distance of the Mirjawa post in which a party of Ghagai Levies is stationed, ana arrangements could doubtless be made for a sentry from the post to look after the hut when not in use. In any case no documents etc need be left there* If, as I personally consider to be desirable, it were /at decided to place a European Subordinate of the poli c eA-l r j aw a fcr passport work, it might be possible to arrange for him to occupy a portion of the very large Railway Rest house there, which was built in the war, and now seldom, if ever, occupied. It is in an excellent state of repair and of such a large size that two or three rooms could still be reserved for officers on tour. Since my despatch ho 290/4/6, in which reference was made to the unsuitability of the present Checking Clerk at kirj awa.7 Mirjav/a, I have received a letter from the Railway authorities, protesting against an unwarranted attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the railway- a further instance of this official*s tactless behaviour. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to His Maj esty* s Mini ster at Tehran* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- C*K.Baiy Major, His Majesty^ Consul for Sistan and Kain.to.240/11/2-C. His Britannic Majesty^ Consulate, Sistan &amp; Kain. To Caii^: Birjand, dated the ^nd- Jups, Q4 i The Deputy Secretary to the Govemme(iV Foreign and Political Department, Examination of Passports of Persian subjects entering India via Puzdap. bn lv h PSlidie ITemor^iiuun. Reference your memorcridum No.D.2015-^/30 dated the 19th May 1930. The action taken at Puzdap is, as far as I aiu aware, similar to that taken at all ports of entry into India viz. passports are examined to see that the necessary visa has been granted, and are marked as •seen*. Certain particulars are taken from the passport and are forwarded to the Police at Quetta, in order that a check can be kept on arrivals in India. On arrival at the actual frontier Mir j aw a - the passport is shewn and from the fact that it has been ’seen* at Duzdap it is krcxa: known that particulars have been taken. The procedure is exactly similar to that existing at Indian ports, where on the arrival of a passenger by steamer, passports are examined on board and necessary particulars taken by the police and marked as *seen t . On leaving the docks the fact that the passport has been seen is verified by the police. As pointed out in my despatch, forwarded to the Govern ment of India under No. 155/11/2-C of 3rd. Ipril 1930, the checking is carried out at Duzdap because that place is the nearest to the frontier at which a Responsible representative of the Government of India is stationed. This is wholly to the advantage of Persian t ravellers, since should the passport for any reason not be in order, it can be rectified before the traveller has proceeded to Mirjawa and has purchased his railway &lt; \, ticket to the interior of India. The contention that once a visa 3 has been granted Persians should enter India without any cfteck whatsoever(tiSb whatsoever would seem to he wholly unreasonable, and, as pointed out in my previous despatch referred to above, the difficulties experienced by British subjects arriving in Persia by the same route are infinitely greater, in spite of the fact that such- travellers have passports duly vise by the Persian authorities in India they are subjected to much inconvenience and delay at Puzdap. ITor do their troubles cease there, for in the case of a traveller proceeding, for instance to Meshed, it is then necessary to tahe out a ^olice permit to leave -^uzdap. Un proceeding on the journey this permit has to be produced at Birjand, where all the particulars thereon, ITame, Age, Descrip tion, Father's name etc are recorded and again at Turbat the procedure is repeated entailing considerable delay at each place. Finally at Meshed the police pass is surrendered and on the return journey the whole process has to be repeated in spite of the fact that the traveller possesses a passport duly vise. a case has just occurred of a British Indian subject, an ignorant pilgrim, who arrived at Duzdap by road, walking on pilgrimage to Meshed. He was unaware of the passport regulations and on arrival at Duzdap was arrested by the Persians, sent 300 miles north to -Birjand for trial and sentenced to one month's imprisonment for arriving without a passport duly vise. He is now being sent back to Duzdap to be deported to India. It is obvious that Persian interests would have been fully guarded, had the individual been sent back from Duzdap, information being given to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul of the action taken. In view therefore of the very intransigeint attitude of the Persian authorities in hast Persia, who lose no opportunity of making matters difficult for British travellers, I trust that the Government of India will not see fit to further relax our system of control at Duzdap, involving as it does the very minimum of inconvenience to Persian travellers, and in no way differing from our system of checking passports of travellers arriving in India by any other route. The complaint of the Persian Consul-General was given rise to by the case of a traveller who arrived at Duzdap without a visar visa and resented a reference being made to the British Consul of the district from whence he came. This individual happened to be on friendly terms with the Governor of -Qiorassan and prevailed on the latter to refer through the Persian foreign office to His Majesty’s Legation in the first place. Achieving no results from this, it is presumed that instructions were issued to the Consul General for Persia, and the complaint has now taken the form of t an objection to passports being examined. It is possible, although notlikely, that some advantage might be gained if the Government of xndia see fit to utilise this opportunity of drawing attention to the inconvenience, delay and ignominious annoyance to which British subjects arriving in East Persia are subjected. Some idea may be gained of the difficulties experienced by the ordinary traveller, when those of His Majesty's Consul for Sistan, presumably a traveller of privileged position, are known. On a recent occasion, the local police at Birjand were informed of my intention to visit Meshed andyere asked for a police permit and any assistance they could afford to facilitate the journey, in addition to the permit,a general letter to all police authorities was given to afford any assistance required and I was informed that the police at Turbat and Meshed had been particularly instructed to cause no trouble. In spite of these assurances and although my arrival was expected, the permit was demanded at Turbat both on the outward and return journeys, and I was delayed approximately half an hour on each occasion. At Meshed on my arrival, 1/ was informed that a further permit for the return to Birjand was necessary. To extract this took a member of my staff about half an hour at the police station. On leaving the town the permit had to be shewn at a post within a few hundred yards of the office in which it was issued and my departure was delayed there while all the particulars were taken. The process was repeated at Turbat. On arrival at Birjand the pass was not asked for, shewing that the whole procedure was quite unnecessary.V fu&gt;? #* Sn route I enquired from travellers how they fared, and was informed that to avoid delay and difficulties it was necessary to produce a •douceur* at each checking post.

Prom i.aj or C• i&lt;« Daly, C. 1 • E•, His Majesty's Consul for Sistan and KAin To The Foreign Seoretary to the Oovernment of i-ndia Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Sir, I have the honour to addressyou on the subject of passport checking arrangements at Mirjawa and intelligence reports from that place. as regards ohe eking of passports, existing arrangements appear to be inefficient and very unsatisfactory. In the matter of intelligence reports there is consider able overlapping and consequent waste of Public funds. Travellers entering British territory via Duzdap - Mirjawa are required to shew their passports at Dusdap, where the necessary particulars are taxen for transmission to the Police authorities at quetta, who are thus enabled to keep a check on arrivals. When the Train reaches Mirjawa, passports are required to be shewn. If they are marked as having been seen at Duzdap, the traveller is duly admitted to British territory. Should this not be the case, or the traveller not possess a passport properly vise, he is not permitted to proceed. The duties of checking clerk are performed at Mirjawa by Faiz Qul. This clerk has been found unsatisfactory by successive Consuls at Sistan. Mr.Gould, I.C.S. in a letter to the Political .gent, Chagai, regarding this clerk wrote *1 am not favourably impressed with this clerk's work. He is, 1 think, dangerously ignorant and ill-educated, prone to be quarrelsome, and ready to gratify private grudges in an unscrupulous manner .* CaptainCaptain Me Cann found his work unsatisfactory 9 as I believe did Mr.Skrine, I.C.S. Paiz Gul has two peons at Mirjawa, one of whom is a police constable seconded from Baluchistan. The latter icnows English and examines the passports, ifaiz Gul being entirely ignorant of English and consequently incapable ofa doing so efficiently. The other peon, I believe has no work other than menial duties performed for Faiz Gul. It therefore is apparent that the responsibility for admitting, or refusing admittance to, passengers to India via 1 irjawa, virtually rests with the seconded Police constable. In view of the importance of this route, and the known fact kMx that emissaries of the Soviet Consuls in Persia, Indians and others, use this route, I believe the Government of India would consider it necessary that some more responsible person, preferably a seconded police official of experience, should perform this duty. It may be regarded as incomprehensible, in view of the opinions of successive Consuls, that Maiz Gul has been so long permitted to retain his post, but the explanation is that he is employed in a dual capacity at Mirjawa, vizi- ( 1 ) as checking clerk under this Consulate, and ( 2 ) as an intelligence agent by the Quetta Bureau, and receives a salary from each source. It appears from the files that the officer in charge of the quetta Bureau regards his intelligence work as of some value, and when consulted has always opposed his transfer. For the information of the government of India, I would point out that in the matter of intelligence reports in regard to the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan, there is much over lapping, and, I venture to suggest, unnecessary expenditure. The Sarhad is included in the Sistan Consulate, and His Majesty's Consul is responsible for reporting matters of importance to the Government of India and His Majesty's MinisterMinister, Tehran. This is carried out by the means of a monthly Diary, supplemented by telegraphic reports in matters of importance. The Political .gent, Chagai, has at Mirjawa an officer designated 'Frontier Assistant'. This official submits intelli gence reports to his superior officer, from which reports extracts appear in the Baluchistan Agency Diary. It is necessary for this official to have hie head-qiuua’t ® 1 ’ 8 near the frontier, and there being no suitable village on the British side of the border, he has quarters at i&amp;irjawa Railway station. We may, I think, anticipate that sooner or later the Persians will object to this official having his head-quarters in Persian territory. The sources of information of this official and of Faiz-Gul, are precisely similar, i.e. information gleaned from passengers on the line and Sarhadis passing through Xirjawa to British Baluchistan or Duzdap. ny information obtained is reporteds- &lt;l) By the 'frontier ..ssistant* to the political .gent, Chagai, and thence to the Baluchistan Administration. (2) By the Checking Clerk (Faiz Gul) direct to Quetta Bureau and to our Trade Assistant (for information of His Majesty's Consul) These reports are subsequently to be found, therefore (a) In the Baluchistan .agency Diary. (b) In the Quetta Bureau Diary (c) In the Diary of His Majesty's Consul for Sistan. It must, however, be stated that r eports r ece ived from such sources are very frequently Unreliable, and as regards His Majesty's Consul's Diaries, are subjected to confirmation from Duzdap, where our Trade Assistant, an experienced Intelligence officer, seconded from the Police, has both adequate funds and means of obtaining reliable information. From an Intelligence point of view, therefore, the work of Faiz Gul would seem to be superfluous and is well known to this Consulate to frequently to be unreliable, based, as it is, mainly on rumour. Our interests would, I venture to suggest, be fully served if reports were submitted to the Political Agent, Chagai, ' —- - . - 1 .-A—.. s ■■ .1Cha&amp;ai, by the frontier Assistant as regards occurrences actually on the frontier* The latter would doubtless be prepared to pass on to the Bureau all information of possible interest to that office. The Trade Assistant at Duzdap would report all occurrences of importance to His majesty’s Consulfand arrangements could easily be made for speedy transfer of informa- tion to Quetta Bureau. The Officer in charge of the Quetta Bureau finds it necessaryt fairly frequently! to require Faiz Gul to proceed to Quetta. During his absence from ^irjawa, the peon remains m in sole charge of the checking of passports. In-as-much as the peon carries out this work at all times» the situation is not materially altered by Paiz (iul’s absence t except in so far as whatever control he may be able to exeroiseover the peon's activities, is for the time being removed. The fact that J^aiz Gul serves two masters, has inevitably led to some slight friction in the past - as for instance on an occassion when he had just returned from casual leave at Quetta and was almost immediately required to proceed there again to see the Gifioer in cii ii ge of the Bureau, consent to which was withheld by the Vice-Consul at Duzdap. Mr.Faiz Gul, who recently proceeded to Quetta was,. j according to information received from the Officer in charge of the Quetta Bureau, admitted to hospital there for some 14 days. Were his post held, as I have suggested, by a competent police officer, a relief would have been found; under existing arrange- ments the peon continues in sole charge. * copy of this despatch is being forwarded to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran.

This system of passport control appears originally to have been instituted by the Government of India in 19 23 (vide despatch Hq. 653/696-? r of the 30th Hey of that year to the Honourable the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan), at a time when the Vice Consol ate at Buzdap appe ars to hove been under the control of that Pkdmin i s tr a t io n. 3. I beg leave to enquire whether it is still considered necessary by the Government of India to maintain this system of control at Buzdap, whereby Persian and other travellers, already in possession of valid British Consular visas furnished in other parts of Persia, are required to undergo further formalities at Kis !Iajesty*s Vice Consulate at Buzdap before being allowed to proceed on their journey, 4, The objections to the continuance of this system seem to me to be two-fold, viz:- (1) In reality it serves no useful purpose because (a) where a visa has been obtained from some other Consular post, the Vice-Consul at Buzdap is not ordinarily in a position to cancel that visa and The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, (b) Simla,(fa) the Tr ice-Cono JL at xfuzda^ is ordinarily less competent to judge the hona fidcs or undesirability of the holder than the officer who has issued the visa, in fact it is, J- believe, the frequent practice of the Vice-Consul ^-t ritizaap, to refuse to issue a visa to a Persian who has arrived irom some other province, on the grounds that he should, apply for his visa in the province where he is hnown and where there is a British Consular Officer. (2) It is open to objection by the Persian Govern ment that a British Indian frontier control point should be instituted on Persian territory, and they have, in point of fact recently questioned the existing arrangement, though their information was faulty. Moreovet i do not consider it desirable that one of His ’ajesty’s Pice Consuls in lersia should be called upon to usurp the functions of a British Indian front!er control officer and thus on occasion to stultify or render nugatory the visa of another Consular Officer in Persia. Such a function would more properly be vested in a Passport Control Officer carrying out his duties on Indian territory; or conceivably on the Persi an s id e o f t he frontier, e.g. at Mirjawa, by a special arrangement between the two Governments similar to that which exists on many European land frontiers. r copy of this despatch is being sent to His Hajesty , s sul at Sistan.

Sir, In continuation of my letter no.290/4/6 dated the 14th July 1930, I have the honour to attach copies of letters xx received from His Majesty's Vico-Consul, Dazdap. Enclosure No.l is a memorandum, in the/ ordinary course of official business, sent hy Khan Sahib Mohammed Gul, Trade .saistant at Dusdap, to the Checking Clerk. Enclosure «No.2 i* a translation of the latter's reply. Eaiz Gul was appointed Checking Clerk, vide Government of India telegram jso. 372 of the 12 th May 1926, on salary Bs.100 per iKensera. He has of recent years designated himself 'Checking Officer', but has nn several occasions been told by His Majesty's Consuls and Vice-Consuls, that he has no right to assume this title. Under my orders he has been correctly addressed as 'Checking Clerk' by the Trade assistant. When X was on tour at Mirjawa in January last, l found that IGuc Faiz Gul had caused his subordinates to refer to him as 'Khan Sahib'. I asked him on what grounds he assumed this title, since he has not been so rewarded. His reply was that as his name was Eaiz .Gul Khan, he naturally expected to be called Khan Sahib. His reference to the officer-in-Charge of the Quetta .Bureau / as having appointed him as 'Checking Officer' is quite incorrect, as the officer in question employs him solely for Intelligence purposes and has no concern with his duties as Checking Clerk, under this Consulate. Wereere it not that inconvenience might be caused to the Quetta Bureau, and that I am not desirous of any re-opening of the correspondence which took place with my predecessor on the subject of the dual control of this cleric, I should have had no hesitation in suspending Faiz Gul from his duties, for what appears to be highly improper behaviour on his part. Faiz Gul has a brother, employed in the police at Quetta (l believe in the rank of police superintendent). During his recent trip to Quetta, (on 20 days leave, subsequently overstayed by 32 days on a medical certificate) it would appear that he has instigated some sort of intrigue, with the object of inducing the Baluchistan Police authorities, to request the return to that Department of iQian Sahib Mohammed ^ul, at present our Trade .Assistant at Duzdap, whose services were obtained from the Police Department. Although neither 1, nor the Khan Sahib, have received any intimation that his return was to be asked for, it has been, according to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, freely spread abroad at Duzdap that the Khan Sahib isto be M sent bacic to Baluchistan 11 . This is of course damaging to the Khan Sahib's prestige with the Persians, as such a removal is always interpreted by them as some form of punishment. I have already received applications 19 for appointment to the post held by the Khan Sahib. Khan Sahib Mohammed tful is performing very excellent service at Duzdap. He is /a very able intelligence officer, on very good terms with influential Persians, and much respected. He is able to perform many important duties, in the nature of those of an Attache, for His ^ajesty*s Vice-Consul. It would be extremely inconvenient at this juncture to lose his services at Duzdap# There are some grounds for suspecting that the recall of his predecessor from Duzdap, who was also on losn from the Police Department, was brought about by Faiz Cul, and the latter's intrigues, ignorance, and general character render him, in my opinion, quite unfit for further employment in his present position# i would &gt; V, , ... ■X would therefore request that the Government of India be pleased to give an early decision regarding my proposal for a responsible officer to be placed in charge of passport checking at Mirjawa* Should this require time for consideration, I would suggest that J'aiz tful be relieved of his duties as Checking Clerk, in which case temporary arrangements could be made by despatch of a clerk from Duzdap to carry on the work. In this case the continued jaut presence of F&amp;iz Gul (regarding whose relations with the railway personnel I have also received complaints from the Railway authorities) at Mirjawa, in his capacity of employee of the Quetta Bureau, would be most inconvenient. 1 have,etc . 9 Sd/- C.^baly, Major, C.I.E., His majesty's Consux for uistan and Main. kncxosure 1.

Subjects-Issue of travel documents called •rahdaris* Sir, I have the honour to address you regarding the issue of travel documents called ♦rahdaris* by the Baluchistan authorities, in particular the Political vrent, Ghanai, to Hazaras and others, travelling to Persia via Duzdap. 2. This question seems to have been last considered by the Government of India in 1924 when it was decided that the system of *rahdaris» should be allowed to continue, because (l) it satisfied the Persian passport regulations at Duzdap, and (2) as the rahdari did not contain any indication of the bearer*s nationality it was not open to objection (letter from the Government of India to His I!ajesty # s Consul-General, i;esned, Ho.9(1)-P, dated 13th N ovember 1224). Since then the in ; -- :3 ers , m f&gt;o ,4? ^josition has greatly altered. So f r fron the rahdaris &gt;- Satisfying the Persian authorities at Duzaap, the latter tz ke &gt;p- 1 0 i Exception to them on the vround that they are not legal , _ :Cxj r JK If VV -XJr rfy&gt; o nationality papers and the entry of anyone into Persia without | ti ^ 1 aj j'j £ Jg such papers is new prohibited. Prom this it also follows that the fact that the rahdari does not indie te the bearer’s nationality so f? r from being a merit is nowadays its chief objection. So recently as 1928 the Director of Persian&gt; ^ Customs o t Du z dap objected to travellers usii p these r a alar is. T ie r.r tter T .vc s rr upecl locally r t the tiiue in an unofficial way but the seme objection is liable to crop up ay a in at any ra ora e n t an d wil 1 3 e difficult to c 0 u a ter. as it i a , t he only reason why the owners of these rahdaris ere allowed to enter lersia is ti£it these documents he r trie visa of the Persian Passport officer at puetto who usually endorses on then the hir th-^.l • ce 01 t he ro0. rsr • 0 . file -o.jority of those who enter Persia with taese documents ore Hazaras, mostly sepoys coming to 1'. 3 shed on leave. These may be divided into tv/o classes; (a) those who are entitled to British passports end (b) these who are not so entitled but who are liable to be claimed either as Aimban or as Persian subjects. In either case the fact that tie mhdari is not a recognised document of n i 0 n lity expose,, the holder to 11 sorts of difficulties in Persia. The r a hdari is liable to be attacheqfor example on arrival in Hashed and the holder then has to ende*. vour to obt in some nationality document. If he is one of those who are not entitled to a British passport {class , b # ), he .ay find it impossible to ao this. If ie is a sepoy in an Indian regiment or a pensioner the Persians may refuse to regie ter din on fne ground that he is of doubtful allegiance* And he cannot get n Isfahan passport oecause the Afghan Consulate is not functioning mt ^res-^nt. Then it does it will probaoly do what it ^ia last sumier in the case of those Hazaras who were born in Afghanistan , .mi whose rohdaris, • itor oemg ioapcmdad rj the P-rsian police, were forivarded to it — tnat is to say, endeavour to make the holders t'.ke cut Afghan passports* In the case of class (:) a hat is those r:ho £ re entitled tc British pn.ssports, the position is not very much easier. The Persian G&lt; vera .ent now views with extreme- suspicion any passports iven inside Persia, by a British Consul ite to x erson who claims to iiave entered Persia recently■fl jt long ago from Inuiu . ^very oor : : ;x cul• LO ‘ • '■ way of giote who possess such passports (passports, tnat is, which do wot o .&amp;r the visa of a Persi n Consular Officer i^ ■*- tJ x,r1 ^ i.. clu - i -g, a a ong ot he r t hinge, refuel by t ne Pe re i - n p Ox x c a to affix the r jav/--z f or exit visa without aiich the .iclaer cannot le-a/e isrsia- The difficulties waich aepoys, cau in ouch Ixive expiree are formidable—nd entirely due to their possession of that embarrassing and useless document the rahdari.

It is 3 cent ini that nyone ring lersia snculd cv.. a 1 rc_:er 'icu-1 1 -y ^ P' r nd it is advisable that all Sizaris who re entitled to British passports on the ground of their birth in India snoulo. oe iven British passports before they Ic.ve ^uetta for Persia, and tnat Certiii- cates of Imperial l aturalisation should be given to those Hazaras who, though born in Afghanistan, are pu .lifted to oe ana utm ..^h to. be naturalised. With regard to the rest, tnat is xx man born Enz-ras who Are not qualified to 3e naturalised as British subjects, it is suggested t ha. t the authorities s mould insist their being in possession of Afghan passports osfore t ey leave I nd ia for r 3 r s ia. 5. to ong the rahdaris forwarded to the Tonsul'-te by the its shed police recently is one belonging tc Ecmin Ali, son of Ali Husain, 1 se - oy serving in the H&amp;zara Pioneers, who has corns ners on leave. ^ is rahdari (ho. 751, dated 30 th Bov ember 1929) was given by the x^olitical Agent, One. ai. ^e .. the holder was born in Kurram end trie re fore entitled to a pass pert as a British protected person was patently discovered oy the Persian passport Officer in ^ueita i/hc has made a nwue oO . na o effect on the rahdari. In cases such asthis There there is no acubt that the holder of the rahdari is entitled to an IndianI -tocur^eiit in iiis possession before leaving India. 5.
