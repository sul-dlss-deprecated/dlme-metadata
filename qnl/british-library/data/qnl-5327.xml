BAHRAIN RECEIPT.\A Extract cf paragraphs 1-8, 13 E. 14 of xieport dated the 30th March, 1947, by the Telecommunications Attache in the Middle East. 1. Although the situation regarding the development of the Bahrein telephone system has improved considerably since the previous visit in October, 1946, and a firm decision has been taken by Cable and Wireless, Ltd., to install a modern automatic exchange, several major difficulties will dcibtless arise as a result of the high water level at various points along the proposed main cable routes, but these cannot be dealt with until the. actual work of installation commences. It is hoped that the necessary exchange and ancillary equipment will start to arrive by the middle of,the year, and while no accurate forecast can be given as to the date of completion, on account of the difficulties referred to above, it is to be hoped that the project will be well advanced by the end of 1947. 2 . . Cwing to the dela:/ in final approval of the scheme, and the increased cost of land, materials and construction charges, the cost of the whole installation will be considerably in excess of that originally estimated, and while it has been tentatively agreed with the Bahreih Government that telephone rentals and charges will remain at the present level, in the hope that some eventual reduction might be possible, it now seems doubtful, even estimating for the maximum possible number of subscribers, if the annual revenue will represent sufficient reutrn on capital expenditure to permit of any such reduction in the existing charges. 3. Arrangements have been made with the Bahrein Petroleum Company to link the new town system with the Company’s new exchange being installed at Awali, but some technical liaison v/ill be necessary, particularly as the Oil Company are understood to be buying American pattern automatic exchange equipment.which may not work direct into the system being installed in the town. BnHruJN -E xt ernal Communi cations. 4. Some appreciable improvements in the handling of external telegraph traffic can be expected shortly, when a direct circuit is opened between Bahrein and London, and, so long as the Brhrein Fao submarine cable is in operation, this link will also provide a useful alternative routeing for Iraq traffic (as opposed to the normal route by wireless London to Cfiro and thence Cairo to Baghdad). Faster handling of external traffic for the Bahrein Petroleum Comapny is also being arranged by the installation of a teleprinter circuit between Awali and the Town Office of Cable and tireless • Lj td. 5. x t was suggested some time ago that radio-telephone facilities should be established between Bahrein and London, and information has now been received by the Oil Company, as yet unconfirmed through official channels, that circuits will be opened both to London and New York by the end of the year. It seems likely that the New York circuit will be established as a relay via London, as traffic would probably not justify the installation of a separate powerful transmitter, while suitable equipment for the London circuit is at present lying crated at the Bahrein wireless station. The M anager of Cable and Vvireless ltd. has not yet received instructions as to whether the equipment is to be installed in Bahrein. 6 . The development of the nuwait area will result in a greatly increased traffic level between there and Bahrein as the linking station with the main world network, and Cable and V.ir less Ltd are already considering extending the present daily schedules with• BAHRAIN RECEIPT.

The existing facilities, operated by Cable and ireless Ltd., on behalf of the Ministry of Civial Aviation, appear to be satisfactory and adequate for the present volume of aircraft + '&gt; traffic. Bahrein - Shir-to-Shore Communication . 8 . At the time of the previous visit, it was suggested that the increase of post-war shipping in the Persian Gulf would necessitate an increase in the two very limited daily short-wave schedules. No increase has yet been made, but the recent expansion in shipping traffic handled by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company's ship wireless service at Abadan, suggests that there might be more traffic for Bahrein if facilities existed. It is~suggested that the matter be referred to the various^local shipping agents for discussion by them with their principals. ■- Exbern al_.Comm uni cat ions . 13. While external communications are at present handled by B.O.A.C. acting as the Agents of Cable and Wireless Ltd, there is no reason to assume that B.O.A.C. will always maintain a ground organisation at u harjah and they have in fact, already suggested w to Cable &amp; Vvireless, Ltd., that the latter should take over the commitment in the normal manner. It has also been suggested that as the RAF will probably maintain their Station at Sharjah, they should take over the present B.O.A.C. commitments including civil traffic, but even should the RAF agree to this proposal, which is considered most unlikely in view of accounting and other difficulties, it is not consdiered a satisfactory solution. It is recommended that Cable &amp; Y.ireless, Ltd., should be prepared tctake over from B.O.A.C. at some future date, although if B.O.A.C. are to remain in Sharjah for any considerable time, it would be uneconomical for two separate stations to operate in so small a locality, and Cable Y.ireless Ltd, need not move in until B.l.A.C. leave. 14. ,t is also recommended that traffic figures to and from Sharjah/Dubai for the past six months should be examined as it would then be possible to estimate whether the proposal made by the local Postmaster to install a telegraph circuit between the two towns, would be justified. iL .
