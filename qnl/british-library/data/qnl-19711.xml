My parents were slaves of Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Than^Huler of Qatar, in whose house If li' : i!, I i I was born and brought up. When I was thirty years old, the said Shaikh Abdullah sold me to one Abdullaii bin Jabur al Musallami of Ghareyah(Qatar)whom I served for 14 years. I used to go for diving with him every year. He took me to | Hasa and got me sold there to one Ibrahim al ♦Aamir of Hasa. I remained with this master for over three years during which period I used to work for him in his garden. Then finding that I was old and no longer - fit for hard work, he set me at liberty,giving me a paper to this effecl and told me to go wherever 1 like. I went to Qatar where I was engaged by one Nakhuda Abdullah Jufairi for diving. When the diving was over,I received my income of Rs.13/- fcy which I married a woman in Qatar. Then I left Qatar for Hasa and went to my master who freed me. I remained with him upto the last Rai dhan when he despatched me in the company of some camel^rs to Qatif.

' r «' ^ • ,t \m Statement of slave Masi^d bin Husain aged about 40 yeara recorded in the Political Agency,Bahrain. I was born in Sana *(Yemanj. My parents were free people. Onee,while i was roaming in the fields outside the town of Sana*,! was kidnapped by some unknown bedouins together with my sister who was with me. 1 was then 6-7 years old. The bedouins in question took me with them to NaJran. They sold me there to one Muhammad bin ^asan bin Shaiban who took me to qatar via Kasa. After three days of our arrival at Qatar, I was sold to Mubarak bin Salman al Sulaiti in whose service I spent a considerable time, inline years ago he died and I had to render my services to his son Hasan bin Mubarak al Sulaiti. Although I used to go for diving every season and earn for him and in winter do other miscellaneous jobs for him,yet he was grossly treating me. Kecontly my master wanted to sell me alone to some pther master. 1 objected to his doing so and requested him that if at all he is resolving to sell me,he may also sell my two small daughters to the proposed master. He did not accept my request and determined to sell me alone. Finding it difficult for me to part with my daughters l absconded from him and went to Abal Dhuloof,a pla^e to the northern side of Qatar where stones are produced. To my bad luck i did not find anybody there to take me away from Qatar territory and, after staying for eight days there, I return ed to Qatar town and made myself scarce so that my master may not catch me. My daughters,however, knew of my return and advised me to leave ^atur by the first opportunity lest I may be molested by ray master. I made ray way again to Abal Dhuloof. This time 1 was fortunate to find a jollyboat2. jollyboat there,by which l came to Bahrain. i request the ^igh British Government to kindly grant me a manumission certificate so that 1 may live a free life. #■' L.T.I .tff Ma.su*(1 'bin Husain. rlr.

The latter gave her to his 'brother 3aif hin Sultan who kept her as a concuMne and got 2 children from her, i .e. the ahove Khadieh and Kalimah. JBoth Abdullah and Saif were dead. A claim was put in on account of diving 'business against the deceased's estate 'by one 3alim 'bin Musahhah of Dehai. The Headman of Khan delivered the women and the son to the said Salim. ihe women state that since the time Salim imported them to .uehai he never well treated them. Although they used to work very hard 'but this seems to have never saved them from their master's oppression. They now seized the opportunity and ran away to Shargah from Dehai. They aave taken refuge in the Agency praying for manumission. 1 'beg to state that i have noticed personally on 6£ their 'bodies marks of ill treatment ( scars^hurning and 'beating) which is quite contrary to humanity. .in my opinion the two women and their son deserve manumission certificates, ihe women would stay in the -Baluchi quarter at Shargah., 7^ btatement male iDy Khadieh Baluchi 'bint Gaif iDin Saltan aged at)out 35 years. lieoorded on the 9th Ha'bi n, 1351 (12-8-32).

Sir, 1. la accordance with the ''Instructions for the guidance of Captains and Cominanding Officers of H.M. Ships of War employed in the suppression of the Slave Trade', Volume I, paragraph 102, I have the honour to forward the following report in amplification of my telegranr sent to you on 20th May. 2. At 1300 (local time) on Friday,ISth May, whilst H.M.Ship under my comaand was lying off Sharjah a Baluchi slave, stating he was a native of Jask, swam off to the ship demanding protection and manumission. Ship was lying six cables off the shore and there was a strong on-shore wind and heavy sea at the time. 3. He gave his name as Esmail bin Haykali and stated that he had run away from his Master (one Ali tin Matrooshi, a dhow owner and pearl merchant living at Hamriyah) owing to the cruel treatment he had received. 4. As will he seen hy his Statement (attached) he made certain allegations against the Residency Agent and his late Master. The man, on arrival on board, was in a very exhausted state and very frightened. He was given food and clothing and, as H.M.Ship under my command was leaving for Debai at 1700, it was decided to take him there as the Residency Agent was coming on board the next morning when confirmation, or otherwise, of his statement might be obtained. 5. On Saturday morning, 20th May, the Residency Agent (Khan Bahadur Isa) arrived on board. He stated that he knew the man's Master (Ali bin Matroo^ii/ but denied having seen the slave before and emphatically denied the allegations against him in the man's slatement. He (the Residency Agent) informed me that he thought the man's statement of having been slave to Ali bin Matrooshi and of having run away from Hamriyah, was probably true, and that there was no liMihood of him having run away to escape the consequences of any crime or to avoid any just commitments. 6. I had intended handing him over to the Residency Agent for further enquiries to be made. When, however, Esmail bin Haykali was confronted with the We the Political Resident Persian Gulf.

He said it would he a repetition of the last time. He would he kept in prison hy the Residency Agent and then handed hack to his Master to he beaten. 7, Taking into consideration the man's state of mind and also the fact that he had swum off over half a mile to the ship in had weather through shark-infested waters to claim the protection of the British flag, I decided to he guided hy considerations of humanity (vide para. 100 of 'Instructions for guidance of Captains and Commanding Officers of H.M.

With reference to my telegram of ord^Jay r reporting the two slaves Nasir Mn Salim and Bilal bin Salim who came on hoard at Henjam vhaving run away from Ras-al- Khaimah, and whose case is still suh jndice, it is interesting to note that when they were asked why they had not sought the aid of the Residency Agent they replied that it was useless, as their Master v/ould only have hrihed the Residency Agent to send them hack. v.

Ky dear Colleague, The British Adviser to the Ministry at Addis Ahaha, who is also Adviser to the Slavery department, has asked me to assist in finding out whether there is such a person as an Arah honorary Vice-Consul at DIBAI (or DOBEI) a place on the Trucial Coast at Lat 25.15, and if so what is his name. The object of this inquiry is to verify the facts of the following story. An Abyssinian slave- a native of Walamo - who was formerly owned by an Arab at Dibai escaped from his master and appealed to what he called 'an Arab Consul representing British interests at Dibai• for protection. The alleged Consul was called ISSA BEN A3D2LATIF. The latter promised him protection but in fact arranged to hand him over to his former master. Other slaves did the same with a similar result, ^he man in question then escaped a second time and swam out to a vessel or dhow which picked him up and took him to Bahrain- at Bahrain another 'Arab Consul^ sent him to Muscat whence he found his way to Karachi- thence to Bombay- Aden and finally to Jibuti when he was interro- -gated- I should be grateful for any information which you can supply on the subject, and if useful information oan be obtained from other quarters perhaps you would be good enough to pass on the inquiry.

U.7 rTHE CASE OF THE ABYSSINIAN SLA^/E WHO ESCAPED FROM DI3AI ITT ARABIA A1TD RE- TITRITED TO ABYSSINIA. SURUR EL HA3ASHI was the slave of a certain Sultan Mas sage r (or Bussager) at DI3AI, Crucial Oman. lie is between 18 and 20 years old and is a native of Wallamo Province in Southern Abyssinia. He was kidnapped in his province, while he was tending cattle, in about the year 1925 and was taken to ?AJTJRA, on the coast of French Somaliland, along with 50 other slaves and shipped to JEDDA. He was sold at Jedda to a man who took him to ^ATI'AR, on the Persian Gulf, where he was finally sold to the above named Sultan Massager (or Bussager) for the sum of 3,190 rupees (sic). In the spring of 1932 (this date is vague as the slave has hazy ideas about time) SURUR escaped from his master and appealed to what he described as an Arab-British Consul at DIBAI named ISSA BEIT ABDELLATI?. This T Consul 7 while promising to help him arranged with his owner to restore him. The slave was kept in the Consulate* for two or three days until his mater T s servants came to fetch him. He was given a severe thrashing for trying to escape. SURUR escaped a second tine (a short time after his first escapade) and went to SIIARQAII where he had been told that there was another T Consul T . The T Consul T s T clerk told him that the Consul was away and that he would be back in a few days. SURUR waited but when the Consul arrived, he was dismayed to find that it was ISSA BEIT ABDELLATIF whom he had already seen at DIBAI. The latter again restored SURUR to his owner who gave him such a beating that he lost consciousness. SURUR escaped a third time after the Eid el Kebir (all the escapes were made within a short interval of time) and We nt to LINIA (?) where he again appealed to the T Consul T whom described as dressed in European clothes and wearing no thing2. nothing on his head. His request for a passport and for facilities to return to Abyssinia v/as refused (Surur cannot give the reasons for the refusal). Finding that his appeals to the authorities were of no avail, SURFR decided to escape by sea. He persuaded three slaves of his acquaintance at or near DIBAI to t 1oin him. Their names are; AMAIT BEIT FA^IAG (Galla from Abyssinia) Zuwayed ben TTabruk (Galla from Abyssinia) WAD Al.IBIJR BEIT IQIAIIIS (ITegro from Western or Southern Abyssinia.) They found an arab coasting vessel at LIHIA (?) the owner of which agreed to take them to Basra for 15 rupees. They worked on the ship and on arrival at Basra accepted to remain as paid hands. Note. The original report omitted the story about Basra and mentioned that STURIIR had seen a Consul at Bahrein. SURUR denies having said this. The present version can be taken as more correct as the original statement was taken in haste. Moreover a conversation carried on by an Englishman, an Ethiopian and an escaped slave who does not seem to understand any language may lead to inaccuracies in a report. The coasting vessel in question called at Basra, Bahrein, Muscat etc and this explains the confusion. Steps are being taken to ascertain the name of the coasting vessel and her owner and the information will be sent in due course^^ ^ ~ About a T year T (?) later a British ship called at Basra. Some Somali stokers from the ship ran across SITRUR on shore and told him that they were working their way back to Somaliland and could arrange for him to accompany them for the sum of 190 rupees. Surur agreed to this. His three companions preferred to remain where they were on the arab coaster. SURUR and the Somali stokers went to Karachi, Bombay and Aden. At Aden, the party found a dhow to take them to Djibouti where SURUR reported to the Abyssinian Consul.

KHALIFA returned to KHASSAB In the boom mentioned In paragraph 2, on 25th March accompanied by one OBEID bin SAGGAR a representative of MOHAMMED bin AHMED, bearing a letter addressed to the WALI In which Shaikh SA'ID of DIBAI explained that KHALIFA 'S i father had been in debt to Shaikh MOHAMMED and asked the WALI to assist in the recovery of the Bebt (Letter attached). 6. When ordered to proceed on board the dhow for conveyance to DIBAI, slave Ho. 1 refused to do so for himself and his family 1 ; and on the morning of 26th March he was taken before the WALI by KHALIFA and OBEID. The WALI states that he informed KHALIFA and OBEID that he was not going to interfere and that they must settle the matter themselves. They accordingly manacled the slave and took him and slaves Nos. 2 and 3 on board the dhow. A female slave, the ex wife of slave Ho. 1 also beloaging to KHALIFA was taken off to the dhow at the same time. She however was later allowed to proceed ashore to collect the family's belongings and was thus not on board the dhow when it was boarded by 'LUPIN'S' party. 7. With regard to the attitude adopted by the WALI, it appears to have been one of 'lalsser-faire' rather than active assistance, except that slave Ho. 1 states that the manacles were produced by one of the WALI'S servants and the HOKHADAH of the dhow states that three of the WALI'S bodyguard were in the boat which brought the slaves off. Second batch of slaves . 8. Slave Ho. 4 - SA'ADEIH bin FARHAH 5 - MESHMOOH son of above 6 - JUMA bin BELLAL slave ho. 6 also belongs to KHALIFA bin MOHAMMED bin THAHY and was afraid that he would be sent to DIBAI against his wish similarly to slaves Hos. 1-3. 9. The case of slaves Hos. 4 and 5 is of a similar nature to that of the others. Originally they lived with their master MOHAMMED bin SA'ID, a pearl merchant at HEHJAM, but migrated to KHASSAB four or five years ago. Their master MOHAMMED died at DIBAI about 3 years ago and they became the property of his son AHMED who, about a year ago freed them. They have since been living peaceably at KHASSAB. 10, . The father MOHAMMED was however, in debt to MOHAMMED BIMBEYAT a pearl merchant of DIBAI, and about a month ago, slave Ho. 4 received a letter from MOHAMMED BIMBEYAT telling him to come with his family to DIBAI in satisfactionam - 3 - KHASSAB - FUGITIVE SLAVES. ('LUPIH'S' Bo. 5/26/634 dated 50th March, 1934.) satisfaction of the debt owed by his late master. This letter the slave took to the WALI who, the slave states, ^ told them to do as they liked about it. On 26th March, K seeing the treatment to which slave Ho. 1 had been / j subjected and fearing a similar fate, slaves 4 and 5 came off to 'LUPIH 1 ' when she anchored and asked to be officially manumitted. 11. Except in regard to the production of the manacles and the composition of the boat's crew which conveyed the slaves to the dhow - which the WALI did not mention - he gave me the same story. c The dhow . 12. The dhow hails from DIBAI and is owned by SALIM bin MUSSABEH. The HOKHADAH's name is SALIM bin SALMAH. She carried a certificate of ownership signed by the shaikh of DIBAI. The HOKHADAH stated that he was engaged in general trading of which he got 50? of the profits and that he had come to KHASSAB for water which, after having called at DIBAI, he was taking to ABU DHABI. There were a large number of filled water tanks on board and there was no sign of the dhow having been specially fitted for carrying slaves. 13. The daughter of slave Ho. 1 whom the boarding officer found in this dhow said that she had come off with her children of her own volition and intended to follow her father. Her husband said that he also had come off to the dhow voluntarily when he saw 'LUPIH' entering the bay in order to take his father-in-law over to 'LUPIN'. The HOKHADAH, when questioned as to why he had slaves on board said that they had been brought off by OBEED with the WALI'S 'soldiers' and that OBEID was paying for their passage. He said that he put no obstacles in their way when they wanted to come over to 'LUPIH' and this was corroborated by the slaves. 14. A copy of this report is being handed to the Honourable the political Agent on arrival at MUSCAT.

At the age of fourteen while shepherding in the pastmrage I was kidnapped by a Bedouin. After eleven days' Journey I was brought to Doha and sold to Ahmad bin Salih, a transport merchant of who again after four days sold me to Salim bin Bakhit of Dalmah. I was working for him, bringing stones and doing other odd Jobs. When the diving season came he asked me to go a-diving. But I was quite ignorant of the Job and told him that .J would not be able to do it. This offended him and he burnt me with red hot iron near each of my ears. The following year again the same mishap befell and 1 was burnt in turee places on my chest and in one place on one of the left ribs. He used to give me food and clothing but no money. Even in clothing he gave me one pair of clothes every yearj for the rest I had to work for others at night while people were asleep. I passed full ten years with him and owing to hard labour and diving I also contracted pain in chest and find it difficult to work. Now happily my master happened to come to Muhaiiaq jnesterday morning en route to Qatif. I was v .ith c .nd seized this opportunity to escape to the Agency and request for manumission .

' in I was born in Lingah where my mother was a domestic servant in the house of a religious preacher by the name of Shaiich Hasan bin Shaikh Muhammad Ali. Ily father was in Mi nab and died long ago. The treatment accorded by Shaiich Hasan to my mother was far from satisfactory and, while I was only a three-year-o Id-child, he turned her out of service, and took me to Dibai and brought me up there. All these years I was serving him and his family. When he died approximately three years ago, I still continued to serve his sons, but the eldest one, Muhammad by name, tried to sell me recently. I wrote to my mother at Bahrain about his intents and she reported the matter to the Government. They addressed Shaikh ? Isa bin Abdullatif, the Residency Agent,Sharjah, on the subject and he sent me to Bahrain to seek the Governments protection and succour and apply for a manumission certific ate. I hope I may graciously be granted my request.

I made inTestigations at Dibai about the ooy in question until 1 found him. I see that what his mother narrated in her petition was not correct, Sangur has a wife and got children from her.

In the year 1352 (1963-34) I came to Debai to earn my living. I went on a diving on hire but did not get anything On the termination of the season I was employed by Ali bin Muhammad al Jelbah and Mubarak al Yaaani who asked ne to accompany them to the Oman Cloast towns for selling perfume^ there—/My pay being Rs.20/-. I went with them and we reached Has ul Khaimah where we stayed for five days. Mubarak went to Sohar in a boat and I remained with Ali. Then we went to Deba by land where we stayed for 3 days and thence to Kalba where we stjayed for four days and from there we went to Sohar where I saw our friend Mubarak there . V/e stayed tnere for a month. Afterwards Ali told me that ne would like to go to Braimi where ne would pay my wages.2 I proGeeded m with taem. Then we reached Braini Ali and X(ut)arak Joined hands tio sell me ?tnd t/hey iDeati me severely in order to admit that I was Ali's slave, '^e sold me to one named Jumail bin Said for 50 dollars, ''he latter sold me to a woaan called 7 atimah 'bint Ali for 60 dollars The latter sent me with her husband to ')e'bai this year^ to take me on diving, ''hen I reached De'bai I found some friends innihitants of my Island at De'bai.

Being a i ree—horn person and not a slave I ran away from De'bai and went to the Hesideaoy Agency for liberation. The inhabitants of Braimi put in complaints against Ali and Mubarak ami there was nothing against me. I now solicit the High 'Tovernment to rescue me from these incoveniemes so that I may live undisturbed at Debai with my friends and relatives .all of Shaikh 3huaib Island.

There are many Abyssinian slaves in the hands of Arab owners. They do not all want their freedom and some are happy. Those who want to escape do not know how to get out of the country. The following are the names of some owners of slaves near or at DI3AI; Abdelatif Manana, 3eid el Tawil, Aissa ben Abeid, Sultan llassager. SUKUR states that when a British ship is near the coast, Arabs hide their slaves or take them some way inland. SUIiUPw did not come in contact with any officials after leaving Arabia. In Arabia the only officials he met were the so called Consuls referred to above. 18 December 1933</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000b6_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/209</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000b6</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/209</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 5/168 V Manumission of slaves on Arab Coast: individual cases’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1936</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-05-09T00:02:35</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (277 folios)</extent><extent>The volume is arranged by manumission cases, of which there are 24 in total.

The majority of the cases are of a straightforward nature. The Political Residency received the manumission statement of a slave from one of the Agencies, and Residency Staff authorise the slave’s manumission in return correspondence, based on the 1913 Guidelines for Manumission.A number of other slave-related cases arise from exceptional circumstances. In May 1933 the Senior Naval Officer (Captain Denison) on board H.M.S.
                           Bideford, and moored over half a mile off Dubai, reporteds to the Political Resident (then Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard-Fowle) that a slave had boarded his vessel after making a hazardous swim from the coast (folio 91). In his statement the slave claimed that the previous year he had sought refuge with the Residency Agent in Sharjah (‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif), who sent for the slave’s owner. The slave was returned to his owner in return for a fee paid to the Agent (folio 93). Similar accusations against the Residency Agent at Sharjah were made by slaves at the British Consulate in Addis Ababa in August 1933. The Consulate wrote to the Political Resident, to ask if the claims of slaves seeking refuge being handed back to their owners were true.Throughout the spring and summer of 1935 the Secretary to the Political Resident sent a series of letters to the Residency Agent in Sharjah requesting information on the status of a number of slave manumission cases. Having received no reply the Secretary wrote on 5 August 1935 that the Residency Agent “may furnish me with an early explanation of the long delay experienced and to report at the same time, the result of the action which you promised to take” (folio 232). No correspondence from ‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif was forthcoming. Later, on reference was made in a letter of 8 October 1935 from the Acting Residency Agent in Sharjah to the Secretary to the Political Resident, of the recent death of ‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>'Īsá bin 'Abd al-Latif</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000b6#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
