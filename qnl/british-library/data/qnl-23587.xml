Included in the file is a copy of a Government of India notification No. 2394-E, dated 23 August 1884, relating to the issue of certificates to sailing vessels, to which a letter from the Residency refers, enquiring whether it is still necessary to make provision for the local registration of sailing craft sailing under the British flag (ff-3-5). The Agency’s response (f 6) states that almost all vessels in Bahrain are registered by Bahrain Customs, meaning there is no necessity for registration under the 1884 notification. In response, the Residency states that order No. 2394-E of 1884 may be considered as cancelled (f 7). A handwritten note in the file notes, dated 24 June 1950 (ff 8-9), provides more details of the Agency’s response to the Residency’s enquiry regarding registration of sailing vessels at Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Maritime legislation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sailing vessels</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00007b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
