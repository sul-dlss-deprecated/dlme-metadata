Initially, the Sultan was keen on getting an Egyptian tutor to be recommended by Muhammad Rashid Rida, a well-known Muslim thinker in Egypt at the time. As British officials were against the idea, they arranged for Sa‘id to be sent to Mayo College in Ajmer, India between 1922-1927. In 1926, the Sultan insisted that his son should be sent to an Arab country where he can improve his Arabic. Suggestions were made to send him either to the American University of Beirut (AUB) or to a school in Baghdad. Later on, in September 1927 Sa‘id started his school in Baghdad.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Muḥammad Rashīd Riḍā</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Taymūr bin Fayṣal Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Education</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00028f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00028f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
