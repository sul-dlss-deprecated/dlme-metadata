I enclose for information a copy of the orders issued by the Bahrain Petroleum Company to regulate the use of the new radio-telephone service. Similar orders will be issued by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company shortly. After con sultation with the Naval Officer in Charge, Bahrain, i have accorded approval to the issue of these orders. • 3. The last paragraph of the orders raises an issue on which I shall be glad to have early instructions. From time to time emergencies arise when it would be invaluable for me to get into immediate touch with the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. For example, the 10th Army recently asked for the immediate presence^bf Mr.Snyder, Chief Engineer, California s. &amp;. / Arabian MFP—1206 S&amp;P—(M-1723)—4-2-36—200,000.Arabian Standard Uil Company :i i ingirt^rl . I received a signal from the 10th Army on the evening of one day, and LIr.Snyder was required to travel by a flying boat leaving Bahrain at 1.30 p.m. on the following day. The necessary arrangements were made - but with the greatest difficulty and with much inconvenience to all concerned. Becently the immediate aid of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company had to be invoked in the search for B.A.F. aircraft which had been forced down on the Saudi Arabian coast and it was thought that personnel might have been injured. If direct communication had been permissible on that occasion many valuable hours would have been saved. Such instances will recur in the future, probably with increased frequency. 4. The Naval Officer in Charge also finds it necessary occasionally to get an urgent message through to the Califor nia Arabian Standard Oil Company. I suggest, therefore, that I should be given discretion, in cases of emergency, to authorise the transmission of messages outside the limited scope allowed to the Companies; and that, similarly, the Companies should not be held to be infringing their under takings if they use their apparatus from time to time to transmit messages at the specific request of the Naval Officer in Charge, Bahrain.

The power of the radio equipment to be used must not be increased to more than that required for satisfactory communication between Bahrain and Dhahran Saudi Arabia.

Political Agent, Bahrain has reported that from time to time emergencies arise which makes its use outside these limits extremely desirable. For instance 3 R.A.F. aircraft recently crashed on Saudi Arabian coast and aid of CASOC was required to search for them and the personnel they contained. If direct communication had been permissible many valuable hours would have been saved. On another occasion military authorities in Baghdad required imme diate presence of Chief Engineer of CASOC. As he could not be summoned by radio telegraphy special arrangements had to be made to get into touch with him which caused great trouble and inconvenience to all concerned. 3. In view of the qbove I strongly recommend that Political Agent be given discretion in cases of emergency to authorise the transmission of messages outside the limited scope allowed to the Companies. -/ 44 - 2 Naval Officer in charge also finds it necessary occasionally to get an urgent message through to CASOC and it is requested that permission may be granted for transmission of such messages on the specific request of the Naval Officer in charge. 5.

Dear Sir, C' . ^ Your letter C/419, which informs us that permission has been granted to install telephonic radio communication between Bahrain and Dhahran, is acknowledged herewith, and I wish to express our appreciation of the assistance that you have given and for the co-operation that has been shown on all sides. We are prepared to meet the stipulations listed in letter C/419, namely: (a) that it is understood that the concession is confined to radio telephony: (b'‘ that it is for the duration of the war only and is subject to revision or cancellation at any time ; (c) that the power of the apparatus used will not be more than that sufficient for communication between Bahrain and Dhahran, and with launches on the waters between the two places, that its use will be confined to a few carefully selec ted staff and that the following restrictions will be observed in operation: (i' the conversations will be confined to matters connected with launches and barges service; no mention will be made of shipping, air or troop movements, mails or oil developmentsi Cii) copies of orders issued by my Company and the names of the officials entitled to use radio telephony will be forwarded to you, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and the Naval Officer in Charge, Bahrain: (iii) only the following frequencies will be used viz. 6575 kc/s, 5050 kc/s, 3537 kc/s and 3287 kc/s; and (iv) silence will be enforced immediately on receipt of orders from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. The Bahrain Petroleum Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have been endeavouring for a number of years to arrange radio communication between Awali and Dhahran, but efforts to come to an agreement with Cable and Wireless Limited have not been successful. The installa tion of crude oil handling facilities at A1 Aziziyah in Saudi Arabia and at Zellaq in Bahrain as a project in support of the war effort makes such communications urgent. The need / for- 2 - 2 » ri (■' for close scheduling of the movement of crude oil by barges between the two terminals and the part played by radio com munication has been explained in previous discussions and correspondence. Communication between Awali and Dhahran is very necessary to the project of transporting oil, and becau* the California Arabian Standard Oil Company does not wish to delay inauguration of telephonicradio communication between the two points, it will accept stipulation (d), which is as follows : 'that your^Company and the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited will reach a settlement with Cable and Wireless Limited regarding the latter's claims, and that if you fail to do so the whole position may have to be reconsidered.' but on the understanding that : &lt;a) such acceptance is not construed as an admission, explicit or implicit, of the existence of any right claimed by Cable and Wireless limited,' and (b) that if no settlement be reached with Cable and Wireless Limited when the occasion arises that Cable and W r ireless Limited will not be entitled to any fees or payment by way of damage, compensa tion or otherwise in respect of such direct com munication by radio telephony as may, up to that time, have taken place.

The operating instructions issued by the California L St® Arabian Standard Oil Company are on similar lines to those issued by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. But para 7 is deserving of particular notice as it implies that the Resident Manager of the Company is at liberty, in the event of emergency, to break the conditions subject to which permission to establish radio teiiphonic communication was granted. Acceptance of this position is obviously open to objection on grounds of principle. But in practice I think it essential that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company should, in emergency, be in a position to communicate direct with Bahrain. For example, it is possible that a California Arabian Standard Oil S. 6. MFP—1206 S&amp;P—(M-l 723)—4-2-36—200,000. / Companyi - 2 - Company field party might see and report by field wireless to Dhahran hostile aircraft approaching, or R./UF* aircraft making forced landings or crashing. it would be intolerable if, in such circumstances, Dhahran were unable to communicate with Bahrain. I suggest therefore that, in order to ensure that the Resident Manager does not without proper cause and full justification disregard the undertakings by which his Company is bound, he should report to me particulars of all cases in which he issues orders under para 7 of the operating instructions; and such particulars would in turn be reported by me to you and to the Secretary of State for India.

Extract from letter from R.Peel, Esq. f to E.P. Donaldson, Esq., dated 8th October, 1940. 5. Cable and Wireless, Limited, as the successors of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Bahrein, do not possess and indeed do not claim to possess, exclusive telegraph rights. They appeal instead to H,M,Cr. to support their interests. It is true to say that no ^rights* of Cable and Wireless would be infringed by allowing The Oil Company to operate a private system of wireless communication between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia, hot extending beyond the bounds of those two countries and confined to the legitimate business of the Company. It is also true, as contended by The Oil Company, that this would not constitute any encroachment on the traffic which Cable and Wireless expected to handle when they took over in Bahrein. On the other hand ohe Political Resident is certainly right in saying that we should have objected to the grant of a concession to another telegraph company so long as the Indo-European Telegraph Denariment maintained the telegraph office in Bahrein, Further, we should naturally uphold the interests of Cable and Wireless against a competing telegraph company and, notwithstanding the informal nature (vide the Political Agent T s letter of 1st July) of the assurance claimed to have been given to Cable and lireless in 1. 58 by the local political authorities to the effect that their position in Bahrein was adequately safeguarded under the present British control, we should not dispute the view that the Company have hitherto counted upon and received our support in Bahrein. The question is whether it would be consistent with this general relationship between Cable and Wireless and ourselves for us to countenance the Oil Company’s proposals. m mCOPY .

He adds, however, that such postponement is not likely to cause an} difficulty in meeting your Company’s requirements either at Koweit or Bahrein, or to endanger their security of tenure. 3. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political Resident’s recommendation, and hopes that your Company will be willing not to press their suggestion in present circumstances.It. 7689/41* ^A' India Office, Whitehall, London, B.W.l 3rd December, 1941 I am directed by the lecretary of State for India to tcknowledge th^ receipt of your .etter of 26th Hovember, 1941, and Do say that he notes that you are prepared to postpone your request ‘or the issue of licences to your iompany at Bahrein and Koweit mtil the end of the war.

The question of the position of Cable and Wireless with regard to the external communications of 'Bahrein has been the subject of much discussion. The enclosed extract from a letter which I sent ta Donaldson on October 8th, 1940, summarises our views on this question. In the correspondence which preceded this letter, Cable and i ireless twice claimed that the —^—— Political ph 3 of Mr.Peel’s letter at P.Z.4641/40. . ) Agent at Bahrein had* given them assurances safe-guarding their position* According to them, as far back as midsummer 1931, their local Manager informed them that w the Political Agent at Bahrein has kindly promised to safeguard our Company by opposing any demands for wireless by the Oil Companies**. Secondly, they asserted that *when the question of this Company obtaining a licence from the Sheikh of Bahrein was submitted to the Political Agent at Bahrein in 1938, we were advised, after consultation with the Adviser to ^ the Government, not to press the matter, as our position \ was adequately safeguarded under the present British ^control*. I enclose a copy of an express letter dated - July 1st, 1940 (which is referred to in my letter to \ Donaldson), in which the Political Agent at Bahrein gave -t his version of this latter assurance. You will see l/40. ) that, according to him, it referred only to — competition from an international cormnunications company , and there is of course no question of that* * ' • ‘ . v/ d l &gt; ’ i ?i) d? &lt;3 X Warren Zambra, Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, tMvTo Cable and Wireles ?lo.Ext.7329/41, date 25th November, 1941 From Cable and Wirele dated 26th November To Cable and U'ireless Ho*Ext.7629/41 dated 3rd December, 1941# 3* Since the date of Eiy letter to Donaldson, Cable and Wireless have raised with us the question of their obtaining a concession from the Sheikh of Bahrein in respect of their cable and wireless services there. .-We referred the matter to the Political Resident, and I enclose a copy of a letter, based on his advice, which we sent to Cable and Wireless on Novembe 25th last, together with copy of C the correspondence v/hich ensued#V You will see, that we have consulted the Political Resident on the question whether the Company can be given an assurance such as is referred to in the second , ; ^ paragraph of their letter of November 26th; but we have not yet received his .reply. , We would be prepared to send him a V '' reminder, suggesting that the ' Company might be given an, assurance that we will use * ar best endeavours to prevent any other communications company from establishing its services in Bahrein in competition with those of Cable and Wireless. 4. our view is that neither such assurances as may have been given from time to time to the local Manager of Gable and Wireless by the Political Agent /[ at oahrein, nor what was said in paragraph 2 of our letter Ext.7329/41 of November 25th last, can justifiably be allowed., in war conditions, to stand if* 'khe way of the Oil Companies being given permission to establish a radio-telephone system which we are satisxied is necessary to enable them to organise their increased production, which in turn is of great importance for the prosecution of the War. This view is oi course strengthened by the fact that permission has been given to the Companies for the duration of the war only, and has been made subject to the other conditions of which Sir Edward Wilshaw has been informed.* 5. As regards Sir Edward’s second point, we feel that you might reply, as you suggest, that the permission to the Companies (which is confined to radio telephony) is subject to revision or cancellation at any tine# ' You/You might add that the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf is arranging for the censor.ship of the Companies’ radio-telephone system; and that although this censorship is admittedly 'being imposed primarily from the security point of view, the naval authorities will no doubt bring to the notice of the Political a authorities any case in which the Oil Companies may abuse the permission given to them* It also seems relevant to mention that the power of the apparatus used by the Companies will not be more than sufficient for the purposes described in their application* 6* Lastly, we should be glad if you would pass on to Cable and tireless the opinion expressed by the political Resident in paragraph 3 of his telegram Ho.T/105 of March 11th, that it will hardly be possible for the Political Agent at Bahrein to use his good offices to promote a settlement between the Oil Companies and Gable and Wireless unless the local representatives of the three concerns are given full power to negotiate by their head offices* I enclose copy cf a letter I am sending to Ballantyne in this connection. •Yours &amp;c., (Sd) R.PEEL.COPT s-s 60 EXT. 1630/42, Dear Ballantyne, cO.:/ . .Jlrcji.;.

They suggest that frequencies below 64 megacycles have however stated that their vievf is that before a final decision is reached, the question should be referred to the Communications Board, Persia and Iraq Colonel W.W.Shaw-Zambra, C.B.E. Commonwealth Communications Council. Halifax House, Strand, W.C.2. 4. On the security aspect - (O T ^ e P. &amp; T. Censorship Department have stated their view to be that the request at (a) in para.2 above does not materially change the situatic: request (b) is a detail for consideration by the local security officer. (ii) The Air Ministry have informed us that while the R.A.F. have no or above 86 megacycles would be appropriate. (iii)The Admiralty (Department of Chief Naval Adviser, Censorship)and they suggest that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should he asked to raise the question with them direct. V 'll pith the lent, Ind 5. As regards (iii) above, there is some practical difficulty in the Admiralty's suggestion since the Political Resident is not represented on the Communications Board, and would probably find it difficult to send anyone to attend a meeting, and it would be difficult for him, apart from the loss of time likely to be ijavolved, to put the matter to the Board by telegram* f e therefore agreed that a simpler solution might be for the matter to be con sidered by the Wireless Telegraphy Board here who could then, if they agreed send a signal to the Communications Board, Persia and Iraq, asking them if they concurred in the proposal to inform the Political Resident direct. We could at the same time send a telegram to the Political Resident explaining what the position was and asking him to await the concurrence of the Coimunica-'* ^ tions Board. You kindly undertook to put this suggestion to the Wireless Telegraphy Board on receipt of a lett er from me in this sense.

Vhen he asked me about it a day or so ago and his language was not fit to be recorded. I must say I sympathise with him entirely because I agree that Cable and Wireless cannot be expected to operate the sort of service the Company require for themaintenance of the pipe line. As Anderson put it to me — 'If we want a monkey wrench from the mainland we are now supposed to get the political Agent's permission before sending the message'. In fact, the service that is required can only be operated with expedition — and without expedition it is useless — from Awali where Cable &amp; Wireless have no installation. Nor indeed have they any at Dhahran. 3. I am trying to get this letter off in time for the ship to Bushire and therefore have no time to verify^but Ward Anderson told me that his Company pay* Cable and Wireless £.100. as token compensation for the technical infringement of their monopoly.

Their 'outward” account appears to be in the neighbourhood of £2,000 per month (about £24,000 per annum), an income to your Corporation which, I think you will agree, has be:.,n entirely ere a cod by my Company's own initiative, labour and cost in opening up the Bahrein area as an i rport&amp;nt petroleum producing and refining Centre. In addition, there is, of course, the 'inward' traffic which has been likewise created and in which your Cor &gt;oration undoubtedly shares. Quite apart from the foregoing, is the fact, as my Coup any understands it, that neighbouring places have benefited, from reductions in tariffs; this being so, my Cor-rpany would further urge that your Corporation allow them reductions not less than those allowed to others similarly situated and with rebates corresponding to the date of commencement of these other reductions. ay we. accordinglv. ask the favourable and early I am sending &amp; copy of this letter to the India Office, with a request that a further copy of it be forwarded to the Foreign Office and to H.M.Postmaster General.

Please refer to your letter DO.C/1131 dated 22nd December, 1945. The Company desires a relaxation of existing regulations to permit two-way business conversacions at any time of day or night between authorized employees of the Arabian American Oil Company in Suudi Arabia. These conversations would cover subjects such as: (a) Personnel matters. (b) Operation and Maintenance of Oilfields and pipelines. (c) Drilling Operations. (d) Operation and Maintenance of Refineries (e) Accounting Matters. (f) Engineering and construction Matters. (g) Essential information regarding cargo, contracts, arrivals, departures, and destination of ships loading or dis charging cargoes for either Company. (h) Launches and Barges Movements between the two Companies. (i) Other subjects connected with the Operations of either Company. I am advised by my principals in New York that this entire matter of radio communication by the Com panies between Bahrein Island and s&amp;udi Arabia is now being dealt with between the Bahrein petroleum Com pany's London representative and the parties concerned in London and it is felt thac arrangements will be con cluded in the near future.

Later adjustments to the service included the right for the Resident Manager of CASOC at Dhahran to be able to send emergency messages too, the extension of conversations to include matters relating to the new pipeline being constructed, and the introduction of new modern equipment to improve the reliability of the service.The volume concludes with a request by BAPCO to extend the remit of their direct communication service to cover all business matters and an agreement reached with Cable and Wireless Limited to permit them to do so. Also included are copies of the orders issued by both companies regulating the use of the radio-telephone service between Awali [ʻAwālī] and Dhahran.Also included in the volume are copies of the notifications issued by the Political Agent at Bahrain to the India Office each time a request for an emergency transmission is made through the Bahrain to Dhahran radio-telephony service. These emergency transmissions related primarily to forced landings of RAF planes, searches for missing planes, and medical results for employees of CASOC at Dhahran suspected of having Typhoid or other contagious illnesses.Other matters discussed include:discussion regarding Cable and Wireless rights in relation to Bahrain, which were determined not to be exclusive rights, and a request by Sir Edward Wilshaw, Chairman of Cable and Wireless to negotiate concessions with the rulers of Bahrain and Kuwait, which was postponed until the conclusion of the war;negotiations between BAPCO, CASOC and Cable and Wireless regarding payment of a nominal annual fee to Cable and Wireless in acknowledgement of their permission for the oil companies to operate their direct communication service;a letter intercepted in wartime censorship which alluded to the continuation by CASOC of the practice of sending sea-going vessels out beyond territorial waters to transmit messages directly to the USA and considered what might be done to prevent such a practice from continuing;the possibility of direct communication with CASOC in Dhahran being established and operated by the Air Liaison Officer in Bahrain to reduce the amount of emergency requests having to be sent through BAPCO;list of rates charged by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, Persian Gulf Section for cables sent to various towns and cities in the United States of America.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 197-209.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company, Chief Local Representative</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>ʻAwālī</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dhahran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Emergency communication systems</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Telegraphy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002a1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
