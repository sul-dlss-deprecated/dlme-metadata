This is reported to be the equivalent of Krans 53765/55, whereas from the extract from the India Office accounts for October 1923, it appears that a sum of £ 1274 / 2/6 reported to be the equivalent of Krans 52942/85, the balance of the Kermanshah Consulate on 3ist March, 1921, w as passed on to In dia ln r esponse to the original debit for that amount raised by the Accountant General, Central Revenues, in the accounts for March 1921 Supplementary against the India Office. 2 .

It will oe remembered that, in October 1923 (India Office note No.P.3583 of 19th October 1923) the sum °t £970,11,10 as representing the balance on the hermanshah Consul si e accounts was paid over to tne India ^ince, and from reference to tne 4 tn paragraph of the despatch from the High Commissioner for Iraq 1 : 0.489 of .o4un Lay 192h, a copy of which, inter alia, was enclosed m Colonial Office letter of 21st June 1923 (28079/25) ivoula appear that the payment of £ 970 . 11.10 made to tne India Office by this Department on 24tn October 1923 representedrepresented th.e closing oade-nce on tne Kemicinsheli Consulate accounts as at 51st July 1921, and. not as at 31st March. 1921 as indicated in the letter from this Office of 22nd September, 1923, 45549/23. In oraer.to verify this point the actual accounts in thehands of the War Office have been scrutinized. The accounts enew ; that a bslance of Krans. 52942/85 was brought fonvard on 1st April 1921, and that the closing balance on 31st July 1921 was Krans 53755/55. From a note in the account for July 1921 it appears that His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah sent a cheque for Rs.15274.14. - representing t.is closing balance of Kraus.53765/55 to the Eastern Bank, Baghdad for the credit of the Iraq Government and it was this amount which was subsequently credited to the Colonial Office and eventually paid ou tae India Office. In view of the above it would now appear that the payment of £970.11.10 included the equivalent of Krans. 822.70, i.e. Krans. 53765.55 less Krans. 52942.85, in excess of the amount due to your Department in respect of the Kermanshah balance at 31st Karen 1921, a . differencedifference which is referred to in War Office letter of 29th April, 1925 as remaining in the hands of the Colonial Office. It is clear therefore that the Krans.486.50 (£8.15.8) recovered by the Consul at Kermanshah from knan Saiiio Abaul Haiy in respect of his Provident Fund contributions for the period April to July 1921, have alieady oeen prid to the India Office, leaving an overpay- mehu 0i ^ ra ns.336.20 - £6,1.5 still to be adjusted with this Department, In tiiese circumstances it would appear that the necessary adjustment with the Accountant General, Central Revenues, Delhi, with regard to the Provident Fund c^i^ri untions sxiould oe made by your Department and that the overpayment of £6.1.5 should be refunded to this prepared to accept a Receivable Order for that sum, sum.

' (The Telegraphic Transfer rate on 15th August was Krans , S40 and on the 22nd August Krans 370). j in the light of this test, it would not seem that Rs .15.275 is altogether inequitable as the equivalent of j Krans 52.943. ^ (l ^ M ' There -remins the rupee-sterling rate for consideration. in March, 1921 it was l/4i, June, 1921 l/H, August, 1921 ! l/3i. On the analogy of the Shiraz Consulate Accounts, the June rate would be applicable, as the Treasury consider India should have brought charges to account not later than the last month of the following quarter. If therefore instead of the June rate the August rate is applied to the conversion of Rs.15.275 we may suffer a theoretical loss of per rupee (say £32). \ t 0 obviate further contention, I would recommend that the sum of £970. 11 . 10 now be accepted as not altogether unreasonable in the above circumstances, and the Receivable Order (herewith) might, I think, preferably be sent to the Colonial Office with merely a 'Compliments' form, without I further comment.

The Consulate Accounts for the months o~ April to July 1921 were transmitted to the foreign Office on 7th Hovember 1921 on their receipt from the High Commis sioner, Iraq, and were subseraiently returned by that department on the ground that they did hot contain any itemsitems of consular euqjenditure in a letter dated 16th December 1922, a copy of *hich, with the accounts in Question, accompanied the letter from this Office of the 29th of January 1925, File 10/12/21, Accounts. e. it will be observed that, in his despatch of 24th May 1923, the Acting High Commissioner Iraq states that adjustment of the claim preferred by the India Office to the sum of Krana.£2942/85 less the sum of Krans 10171 will be varied by the fact that, undde a misapprehension, the Consulate at Kemanshah remitted to the Iraq ovarn- ment a sum of Hs 15274/14 as representing the amount of the ©losing balance on hi» account for the month of July 1921, and that credit for this sum was allowed to His Majesty’s Government in the Iraq Account urrent with Kis Majesty’s Government for the month oi January 1922. 7. On this point I am to observe that allowance was made for the sum of Hs.15274/14 for which credit was allowed by the Iraq Government to the Colonial Office m January 1922 in arriving at the net sum oi :813.15.0 claimed from your Department in the letter from this Office of the 29th of January 1923, File 10/12/21 Accounts, and that the sum of £813.15.0 was subsequently incorporated with other expenditure in the further statement which accompanied the letter from this Office *if th 6 14th of June 1923, File 27/3/22 Accounts, and it. iccordingly reflected in the closing balance of receipts ver expenditure of «J8735.15.5 as brought to account by he Iraq Government to 31st March, 1922. £ It will be gathered from-what has been stated hat adjustment of the claim of the India Office to the im. of Krans 52,942/85 less the sum of Kraus 10,171 will ie affected by the Army Council's decision in regard to he claims already preferred against the War Office in he letters from this Office of the 29th of January and |he 14th of June 1923.

For reference to specific authority for outlay in question it will / I fear^be necess^B^^^ consult India. Please see Foreign Office letter of 11th March i | below. The Consular Department of the Foreign Office is i notoriously narrow - and ignorant; but we night i i perhaps take them at their word, and agree that in I | respect of the period prior to September 30th 1921 we 1 Agree 'htfc-pay in accordance with the V/elbv Commission v - - 1 J t V n rangements a moiety of what they certify to be 'purely* Consular expenditure', and no mor e.

X c' 5479—1 .3000 6.22under military orders in his capacity of Political Officer to the Mesopotamia Force and any expenditure over and above purely Consular expenditure might roughly if be classed as War Expenditure. (The fact that the [ Kermanshah consulate, normally a Foreign Office post, : was, during the war, often held by Indian service officers [is of course accidental and has no bearing on the question of incidence.) It will be for the Consular Department f the Foreign Office to pursuade the War Office to agree o tne arrangement suggested. The Accountant General's note of 12 May appears possibly to refer to the kran balances in question in F.3648. If the suggestion in the preceding paragraph is adopted the balance should be regarded as a credit Ho War Office against the non-consular disbursements of tne Consul in the period before 30th September 1921.

From the third paragraph of your letter the Secretary of state is lad to believe that some misapprehension may exist in your Department as to the position in respect of this Consulate, 3. Kermanshah is a post ordinarily held by an officer of the Levant Consular service and was so held prior to and during the war, till it had to be evacuated / under pressure by the enemy / early in 1916, On the re-occupa- tion of the town resulting from successful operations in Mesopotamia ; it so happened that with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the Consular appointment was / filled, owing to the exigencies of war time conditions, by officers from the Indian political Department (as were other posts in Persia which are normally filled from the Consular Service) and subsequently by military officers tic serving with Mesopotamia Expeditionary ForceForce or under the Civil Commissibnor Mesopotamia. The local conditions, as Kermanshah was an important point on the line of communications of the forces operating in Persia under the directi or the General OfficerCommanding Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, were such that the Consul performed many duties and incurred much expenditure other than can properly be described as Consular. The enclosed copy or m t-hff v from Colonel Kennion.the officer^ppJinto Kermanshah after its re-occupation in 1916, will sufficiently explain the conditions. Similar conditions to those obtaining during the war seem to have obtained for some considerable time after the conclusion of hostilities^owing partly to the retention of IIorperforce in Persia and to other perpetuations of war time developments^'an d the officers holding the appointment of Consul Kermanshah may well have had to incur expenditure other than purely Consular expenditure even during 19£l. Such expenditure should be regarded no doubt mainly as military expenditure and, as such, be reclaimed from the War Office. normally, as has been stated above, the Kermanshah consulate is staffed, under the directions of your Department, by officers of the Levant Consular service; the Consulate acco-fliitk of '3 ^c/t' ^' C/U ~£ ^Department Department and a moiety of the approved expenditure is recovered, in accordance with the arrangements resulting from the Welby Commission! from this Office in the process of the periodical (usually annual) adjustment of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia* These normal conditions were regained with the assmnption on // -&gt; o /r, / 9th April 1921^ of^/the kermanshah Consulate by Mr.H.P.Cowanj and the examination of the Consulate accounts from that date naturally falls to your Department as the conpetent authority. I am therefore to return the accounts for April-July 1921 received as a sub-enclosure in your letter under reply, for disposal. The Secretary of State in Council will be prepared to accept as a charge on Indian revenues a moiety of such of the expenditure, shown in these accounts, as your Department is prepared to accept as purely consular expenditure; the excess will presumably be claimed by your Department from the Colonial Office or the War Office as the nature The Secretary of State for India must definitely decline to accept any liability in respect of this excess, Indian revenues being onlyonly concerned with the ICermanshah ConsuIsTte-ar-^* Ja m 3 i e1: y of consular expcndi tare. ^ As regards the details of the accojmts received from Mr• Cowan throngl^the Colonial Office, I am to point out that prior to his assumption of duty the Consulate was kept in funds by the financial authorities in India (either directly or indirectly through i&gt;ne Civil Administration of Mesopotamia / i which itself was largely financed from India). The closing balance of the Consulate account in March 1921 has been notified by the Accountant General, Central Revenues, India, as Mr.52,942»85 the sum shown by Mr .Cowan as his opening u: balanc^T^As the Consulate is now financed by your Department I am to requ the refund of this sum (equivalent at the then prevailing exchange to Rs. 18256 or £1274.2.6) less, however, the sums shown in the accompanying copy of a letter from the Accountant General Central, Revenues, as due to the Foreign Office, and totalling Krs.10,171. 7- As regards the charges for the consular escort at Kermanshah, it is understood *fr om the last sentence of your letter that it is the usual practice for the Consular officers at the posts in Persia filled from the Consular service to submit statements of expenditure incurred on their est respectiveDraft Paper.

Gough’s Indian pay, travelling allowance and sumptuary allow ance of Two hundred rupees per,mensem, but limited the Local Allowance to that officer to Two hundred rupees per mensem in lieu of Three hundred rupees on the ground that the former rate had been in 1913 proposed for the post and was equal to the amount of Local Allowance adopted in the case of Major.

I am, Sir Your most obedient, humble Servant, Copy to 5tn ia // 4t7i/n . ^e Under-Secretary of State India Office.Dear Dr.'Silkina, Sir L. Abrahams has handed on to me your letter of 23rd December about Colonel Reunion's allowances as Consul at Kermanshah. I'he facts are that Kennion was ordered to proceed to Kerianshah in June last vice Couph, who had been diverted to Shiraz, but was held up at Ispahan by the Turkish occupation of Kermanshah. He has been at Kasvin since Auraist, and, for a time at least, was with the Russian forces operating between Kasvin and Ramadan. The proposed H remunerative” allowance of te.3()G a month does not exceed the total allowances (Rs.20C local allowance and Rs.100 sumptuary allowance) drawn by Reunion at his l^st post (• ohammerah). It is no fault of his that he did not take up his duties at Kerman shah. His ajesty'n Government thought it worth while, in June, to n an attempt to ret him there. The attempt failed, fhey have since thourht it worth while to keep him at Kasvin, presumably in the hope that the military situation may improve (i.e. that the Russians aay succeed m drivmr R.F.Vilkins Esq., C.B., Slc., &amp;,q. , &amp;c. # Ihe Treasury. v&gt; • * 9 backback the Turks) and that the British Consul and Colony may return to Kerraanshah, as they hav* returned to several other places in Persia (e.r. Kerman and Bhiraz) after temporary eviction# Kennion is thus in a state of potential utility; and it seems clearly incumbent on His-Majesty’s Government^ so Ion# as they keep him in this position, to see that he does not suiter pecuniarily through their action.
