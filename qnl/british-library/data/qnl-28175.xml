I do not know how to thank you enough for whatt you have done for Rainier, as from what I gather from Channon's letter/, the M.O. of the Deptford said that they had only just arrived in time, otherwise-he may have lost his leg, and I presume tha't further delay would have been still more serious. I am writing CoraDander Neville Harvey also, thanking him for his kind and timely assistance. I should like to tell you that I believe our venture at Bu Musa seems likely to be crowned with success, as the samples received have been steadily improving, and we have just received a cable from Channon sent off from Sharjah, to the effect th^ he has located a still better deposit, so it looks as if we may have now discovered a grade equal to the Ore shipped from Ormuz', as recent samples were fairly close, and the cable definitely says that the Ore bed has improved very much in quality. This is very encourag ing, as after Barnett’s disastrous expedition last year - when we only received 200/30Q tons of very poor Ore hardly worth the Freight paid on it - my people almost decided to abandon the place.

We gather that the deposits have not yet been fully opened up, but when the two Members of the expedition return I have every reason to think that they will be able to confirm that there are very substantial quantities.

I have studied your Corapany’s Agreement \fciih the Shaikh of Sharjah and have discussea the points reisea by you *iih the Shaikh. I will deal with the question of the canteen first. The Shaikh of Sharjah maintains that his agreements with your Company (of which I enclose copies for your use) do not concede to your Company the ri*ht to open a shop on the Island of Abu Musa, and that your aoiiifc so is adversely affect ing the interests of his subject to whom he gave permission to doraome years ago. He also claims that your Operating a canteen affected his revenue derived from the commercial activities of hds subject. 3. It is not clear whether or loot article 6 of the Principal Agreement between the bhaikh and your* Company includes a concession to open a shop for the sale of foodstuffs to your employees; and, in view of the bhaikh's attitude, it would be necessary, if you so desire, to refer this point to the political Resident for arbitration under article b of the Principal Agreement. 4. I have, however, discussed with the shaikh the rates charged for foodstuffs in the shop ana he has assured me that it is his wish that the prices should be reasonable. I enclose a list of the prices he has now fixed. If—taking into consideration the prices of grain supplied unuer quo Wi thes e prices are not, in your view, reasonable or if higher prices are in fact charged in future. I s**all be glad to take up the matter with him again on hearing from you. Meanwhile, the Shaikh lias informed ite verbally that he would have no objection to your paying your labour in cash and in kina, instead of wholly in cash. You therefore at liberty to issue free rations to your workmen if you consider that this practice would be more satisfactory than their having to purchase them from a shop run by one of the Shaikh's subjects. 5. The intimidation of your workmen ana the abduction of the three tindals by Khalif&amp;h bin Saif has also been taken up with the Shaikh of Sh&amp;rjah ana his attention has been drawn to article 3 of the Supplementary Agreement dated the 22nd Feberuary, 193b• The Shaikh has pi'omiseu to oeal with Khalif&amp;h bin Saif ana h&amp;s undertaken that there will not be a recurrence of this violence. 6 . There is nothing in your Company's Agreement with tlie Shaikh to compel you to employ only subjects of the Shaikh of Sharjah and you are free to employ the men best able to do your work. You will appreciate, however, the Shaikh's desire to secure employment for his subjects; ana it might be well for you to employ those of them who are satisfactory workmen, while not allowing yourself to become too dependent on them. a ^*h.

Dear Sir, Since writing to you on ti^e 24th inst, Shaikh Sultan has made demands through Rashid bin liaoaa that no men of Persian origin shall be employee here. He has backed this up by sending a large number of Arabs here whom he is trying to force me to employ. In accordance witn my agreement I have dis charged all the men, both Persian and Arab, who are not subjects of Sharjah, but now the Shaikh has sent two armed men here to terrorise the remaining Persian (who are his subjects) into going. This violent interference with my work and administration cannot be tolerated, and if necessary I am prepared to close the mines until I may be sure of being able to employ the men I wish without hinderence by the Shaikh. 1 have asked Hossein to send his Launch in oiaer that I may visit you in Sharjah to discuss the matter.
