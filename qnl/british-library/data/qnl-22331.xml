The Political Agent Bahrain now reoorts that two persons were convicted on 20th July last for sale of cultured pearls and were sentenced to seven years 1 imprisonment. The chief means of livelihood of all the Arab States of the Gulf is by pearling and the introduction of cultured pearls would ruin many merchants and a: reduce to destitution thousands of poor pearl divers. The case, therefore, has caused considerable interest among the Arab communities of all classes along the Arab Coast and it is expected that this sentence will have the desired effect of pre venting the further introduction of the cultured pearl into the Gulf.

Judd Street Woodstock, Illinois U. S. A. ^lacologist. June 3rd, 1936. clarence e. hoy. Minister of the Colonies, Colonial Office, London, England. Excellency, Great Britain has a number of colonies where there are rich beds oi the pearl oyster. I have a process which you nia^ consider to be oi yalue to one of these colonies. This process consists oi a method for the growing ol a pearl which is in every way identical with what is generally termed genuine, wild or real pearl. iou are aware that the Japanese have for many years been growing and marketing wnat is called the Culture Pearl. While the same length of time is consumed in the production oi all oi their pearls, the variations in sizes are attained by the use of mother-of-pearl balls of different size. These pearls are readily detectable by the expert and are now sold for what they are - cultured pearls. Under my process a tiny particle, such as a grain of sand -ior example, is placed in the flesh of the pearl oyster by a much simpler and far less serious operation than is used by the Japanese. It is Quite similar to the natural or accidental method by which the wild pearls are started. men finished such a pearl can, by no possible method, except perhaps a process of elimination, be detected from the wild pearl. This much being granted, the value will be the equivalent of those of equal weight and quality among the wild pearls/2. pearls. In a letter of moderate length, I must ask you to accept as a fact my statement that pearls do not require anywhere near the time for their growth as is popularly supposed. It is quite probable that the age of a pearl weighing ten grains is between four and seven years. The difference in time is accounted for by the variations in the salinity of sea water in various pearl beds. The higher the salinity the greater the amount of calcium for shell growth, and the faster and larger do the pearls and shell grow. There are no pearl beds in the continental or territorial waters of the United States. I must therefore, seek a location elsewhere. So far as I am able to learn Japan is the only country which now leases sea bottom to private enterprise and grants ownership of the cultivated sea life. Elsewhere the occasion has not arisen for such action. I suggest that you choose one of your colonies for the introduction of pearl growth, securing from me the exclusive rights under my process. In making this suggestion I am assuming that it will be simpler to accomplish the requirements for such an enterprise than would be the case under a home ruled administration. It is suggested as a government enterprise as such a form would assure the protection required against poachers. In the limits of this preliminary letter it is hardly proper to make any attempt to cover all phases of the matter. I assure you that I have a process which is satisfactory in every way and that such an industry will be most profitable. It is reported by the press of this country that the profits of the Mikimoto Company of Japan are/.1# 3. are something like £50,000,000 per annum. In submitting this matter to Great Britain I am refraining from making the proffer elsewhere and will appreciate highly an early letter of reply indicating your position. Please understand that I shall be glad to furnish fully information which will allow you to formulate accurately your final judgment. Most sincerely Sgd. CLARBliCi£ F. HOY.Copy . 6672/38/36. 29th June, 1936. Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd June on the subject of a pearl culture process which you have devekped. The Secretary of State does not consider that it would be possible for any Colonial Government to under take on its own account the production of pearls by this or any other process. It is probable, however, that the Governments of those Colonial dependencies where pearl oysters are known to exist - namely Somaliland, Ceylon, Aden, Fiji, and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands - would be prepared to give facilities to a commercial company which was able to place before them sound proposals for the establishment of an industry of this kind. Copies of this correspondence are being sent to the Governments of the Colonies mentioned above. I am, etc., Sgd. G.L.M. CLaUSON. CLARENCE F. ROY, Ei&gt;4.Gopy . 502 W. Judd Street Woodstock, Illinois Malacologist. U* A. July 8th 1936. CLAESBCB k. HOY. Attention Mr. Gerard L.M.Clauson for Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore. Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W.I., London, England. My dear Sir, I am pleased to make acknowledgment of your letter of June 29, 1936. It goes without saying that, throughout the Empire, where there are many pearl beds, these beds are a very consequential asset. I shall therefore bring before you certain information which has come to me during the past six months and which only within the last ten days has crystalized into a certainty. As the general dissemination of the information I am about to convey to you would be disastrous to the pearl market, I am sure that you will treat it with reasonable discretion. It is my understanding that the pearling industry has found that their overhead expense is carried by the pearl shell which they take and that the profit, if any, must come from pearls which are found. There are probably variations from this rule but, in general, it is safe to follow. Therefore, if pearl values are adversely affected, profits likewise must suffer. Also as a general rule, when we find some secret is being carefully guarded, we can assume it has some considerable value. File 6672/38/36. For/For many years the stories told by the Japanese about the details of their operation for the growth of Culture Pearls have to one who is informed on the subject, been ridiculous. The real operation has been carefully camouflaged. On May 1, 1936, Arthur Brisbane, columnist for the Hearst chain of newspapers, wrote of an interview he had with a representative of the Mikimoto Company, Japanese pearl growers. In part he says, M 0n the tiny island of Palaos in the south seas, near Uncle Sam’s island of Guam, millions of oysters are planted on forty-three acres. Women make a slit in the muscle, insert a small fragment of mother-of-pearl, sew up the slit with silk, and 'plant' the oyster.” This is the first time I have known the true facts of their operation for Culture Pearls to be publicly told. This can hardly be classified as an error in diplomacy. In my opinion it can only mean one thing - the Culture Pearl has ceased to be of prime importance in their business. There is something vastly more important afoot. Aside from the Brisbane interview I have seen mention of the island of Palau as a seat of Japanese pearl growing buu twice. It first came to my attention in a report ol a study of the Mikimoto Company, made by the Japanese Government. Next, an article in the April 1936 issue of the National Geographic Magazine by Willard Price. Mr. Price mentions the efforts to dissuade him from making a trip to the Caroline Islands by the Japanese. One sentence suflices to cover the pearl industry, 'In the Quiet lagoons oysters are trained to produce pearls in great numbers.” In the Brisbane there is an apparent utter candor. In Mr. Price's story is evidence of secrecy and reserve.A number of months ago I offered to the Mexican Grovernment the exclusive use of my process for growing Genuine Pearls. Finally, under date of June 19, 1936 ana translated, comes the following, n We wish to explain to you that the Government has already engaged the services oi some specialists for the same purpose and therefore will not be able to use your services.” The only world source of such specialists is Japan. Please note also that they are employed for “the same purpose.” In the light of the foregoing it seems to me that only one conclusion is logical. The Japanese have developed and are now using some process for the growth of a Genuine Pearl. My own research has proved to me that it is possible and even probable that they have done so. how will this affect the pearling industries of the Empire’s Colonies? The Japanese have never hesitated to flood the markets with anything manufactured by them with the cheap labour. They will have no conscience about what may happen to the values of the pearls now held in the world. If they have what I think they have, it must be borne in mind that, once out on the market no expert can oell whether the pearls have been grown intentionally or by accident. Pearl prices are quite low at present. Neither singly nor in combination can this low ebb be accounted for by the ’depression’ and the Culture pearl. There is another factor which I believe has a very definite bearing on the matter and this I believe is an increased volume of genuine pearls, of Japanese origin. If I have made a correct analysis of the situation what are we to conclude? Only this, - unless some agreement/agreement for controlled marketing can be made with the Japanese, and this I believe to be doubtful, the only pearl beds in the world which can survive such an onslaught are those where a profuse quantity of shell can be had easily and cheaply and depend upon shell alone for the profits. Such profits will be small of necessity. The salvation of such a pearl field would lie in some such process for growing pearls as I have offered. My process is so simple and fast that a very few operators could turn out pearls at a very nominal cost. I have no fear of competition from cheap labour with this process. I realize that ordinarily government would not undertake entering into such a business as I suggest. However, it seems to me that the circumstance is extraordinary. This means commercial struggle. Most governments spend large sums in experiment to develop military supremacy. Why not for commercial supremacy? With this in mind may I suggest a plan under which I shall be willing to co-operate. My experience has taught me that when it comes to growing pearls the subject is so new that it is difficult to interest capital until they have seen results and have been convinced that the process is as claimed. To prove a process for growing pearls takes more time than anything else I know of. The experimental plant must be set up, oysters treated and given identifying marks and then wait some months for pearl growth to show appreciable advancement. If your government or that of one of the colonies were to establish a small plant as an experiment, within six months there would be sufficient pearl growth started to be convincing. At that time private capital could be very easily enlisted. An experimental plant such as I suggest could be carried/carried on in a small way. There would be required a small building in which to work, tanks with some arrangement to pump sea water so that the oysters could be properly cared for before and after the operation, material and labour for crates in which the treated oysters are to be planted, and part-time use of boat and divers who would gather young oysters for treatment and replace them where the planting beds are to be. I have on hand enough tools for an experimental plant. My transportation and expenses to the seat of operation should be provided for as well as a guarantee of return fare and expenses if it should be decided not to continue. The test plant should be operated for six months with a salary to me of Si2,000,00 for the 6 months period, payable monthly in advance. I do not see how the cost of conducting the test for the six months can exceed 2.6,000.00. Before the test period shall have elapsed, pearl growth will be started. I should use during this test a type of nucleus which would not be found in a pearl in any whioh are grown ’wild*• In this way it can be indubitably established that the pearls were started by me and eliminate any doubts as to my capabilities. It is my suggestion that the Home Government or that of one of the Colonies be induced to undertake this test. It has always been my impression that Australia was Britain 1 s greatest producer of pearls. If so, that might be the proper place to undertake such a project. If there may be any doubt as to the sort of pearl which might be produced under my process I quote an opinion of Mr. A.M. Malpas, Marine Biologist of the Ceylon Government, expressed in a letter to the American Yice Consul at Ceylon (Colombo), 'Mr. Hoy is correct in stating/I stating that, provided the inserted nucleus is minute, the resulting pearl cannot be detected from the naturally produced pearl, — 11 . At the risk of getting into technicalities, I might state that the Japanese method uses a location which is among the poorest in the pearl oyster for the production of first quality pearls. This location is used because it will stand more rough usage than any other. I doubt if they have changed the location or have greatly altered the method. My process allows the choicest location in the shell to be used and will therefore produce the best of pearls. A pearl will approximate in quality and color, the shell at the nearest point. I trust that the possibilities of a new pearl being produced by the Japanese and its effect on British Pearl beds will have your serious consideration and that some sort of a plan can be evolved. Needless to say, I would rather work under British protection than in some country where language and other conditions are not so favourable. As the name Hoy is found in many parts of the world perhaps it would be well to state that my ancestors were English.
