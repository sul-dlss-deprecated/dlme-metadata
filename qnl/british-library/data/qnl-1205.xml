Sir, With reference to my despatch No.101 of February 24th, I have the honour to inform you that a party of fifteen Iraqi senators, deputies and notables left Iraq on March 9th for a visit to Syria, Palestine and Egypt, and returned to Bagdad on April 1st. 2. You will no doubt receive from His Majesty’s representatives in these countries full accounts of the events which marked this tour. Judging, however, from the reports which have appeared in the Iraqi press, it was a great success. Everywhere the Iraqis were made much of, feted and most hospitably entertained. 3. For their part, the visitors worked hard to make the most of their opportunities to strengthen the religious and social ties which link Iraq to these sister Arab countries. They made innumerable speeches in which they stressed the fundamental unity of the Arab peoples and pledged the help and sympathy of Iraq to all their brother Arabs in the struggle for independence which ir&amp;u had herself won. 4. In some instances, the zeal of the speakers outran their discretion and an oration delivered at Nablus by Said Thabit, a deputy for Mosul, appears to have been particularly violent and provocative. I have remonstrated with both the Prime Minister and Nuri Pasha about this speech and have warned them that Said Thabit’s conduct The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc. may/2 . may make it difficult in future for Iraqi visitors to obtain from the authorities the courtesies and facilities which this party enjoyed. 5* There is now talk in Bagdad of return visits to fraq by groups of influential men from Syria, Palestine and kgypt, and of a tour of the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf by another unofficial delegation of notables from Iraq. 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Cairo and Jerusalem, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Beirut and to His Majesty’s Consuls at Damascus and Aleppo.

Caroemm GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. September 29th 1937, Dear Hickinbotham, As I told you yesterday H.H. has been informed verbally that Sapud, son of H.M. Ibn Saoud would like to be invited to visit Bahrain. H.H# has discussed the matter with Shaikhs Abdulla and Sulman and has decided to write a letter to Ibn Saoud saying that should his son like to pay a visit to Bahrain he would be very welcome. Before writing this letter H.H. wishes to acquaint you with the suggestion and has asked me to find out from you whether the Government of India would have any objection to the visit. As far as we are aware there is no political significance in the visit. Ramadan begins in about five weeks and it is likely that the visit would be before that month so H.H. would like to have your views on the matter as soon as possible. Personally I can see no objection to the visit. • *Telegram Q From Political Agent, Bahrain.

As far as is known there is no Political significance. 2* I have consulted Adviser and consider that from a Political point of view there is no objection.

Dated, lOthShawwal, 1356 December 13, 1937.Confidential No. C/933-12/11 Political Agency, Bahrain, 25th December 1937 From H. 7/eightman, Ssquire, I.C.Sa, Political Agent, Bahrain To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report on the visit of the Amir Saud to Bahrain. 2. The Prince arrived at B£anamah on the 15th December 1937 by launch. He had been met on the mainland by Shaikh Mohammad bin 'Isa and by Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, respectively elder brother and eldest son of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. He was accompanied by two of his brothers, three cousins and a nephew, and by about 40 followers and servants. 3. He was met on arrival by His Highness the Shaikh and the A1 Khalifah Family, by the Political Agent, and by the officers of the Bahrain Administration. The arrangements for the reception at the Customs pier were admirable in every way, but the dignity of the ceremony was sadly marred by the uncontrolled behaviour of the Saudian followers, who swarmed off the launches and reduced the reception to some thing more akin to a foot-ball scrimmage. The Amir Saud, in striking contrast, deported himself with dignity and calm. It was however a thoroughly uncomfortable affair, and I would not recommend that the Political Agent should be pre sent at any similar arrival in future. It is true that on this occasion no one was pushed off the pier into the sea, but the possibility of an exit in this manner is by no means remote./-f II I i remote. A big crowd assembled outside the pier gates to see the procession, which was accompanied by a pandemonium of horn blowing by the drivers of the cars, who apparently were not impressed by the fact that the route had been cleared. 4. The Amir Saud stayed at the Palace in Manamah and on the first night dined quietly with His Highness the Shaikh at Sakhir, this being followed on the next three nightd by dinners at the houses of Shaikhs Mohammad, Abdullah and Sal man. On these nights no European guests were invited. It is amusing to note the local view that the date of the visit had been suggested to the Amir Saud by his companions and followers in order to coincide with His Highness the Shaikhs Anniversary Celebrations, as these are usually marked by a certain loosening of normal restraint, with a consequently greater expectation of pleasant adventures in the town. It appears from reports that they were not disappointed. 5. On the 16th December, I called on the Amir Saud, ac companied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. His Highness the Shaikh, most of the A1 Khalifah Family, and other notables were present, and the ceremony was adequate. A friendly note was struck by an invitation to me from the Amir Saud to visit him in his own home in the near future. 6. On the 17th December, I called on His Highness the Shaikh at the Palace, again accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, on the occasion of the Anniversary Celebrations. The Amir Saud was present and informed me of his wish to return my call. The return call took place the following morning, December the 18th, His Highness the Shaikh accompanying the Amir Saud. The visit lasted about 20 minutes. In the afternoon of December 18th the Amir Saud accompanied His Highness the Shaikh to the annual Municipal Garden/- i3— Garden Party given in honour of the latter, when the usual laudatory speeches were delivered. 7. On the 19th -Meeember, the Adviser to the Bahrain Go vernment gave a dinner party in honour of the Prince, at which ladies were also present. This was followed by large dinner parties on the two succeeding evenings at the Palace and at the house of the Saudian Agent in Bahrain, the days being occupied with hawking and Arab dances. 8. On the last evening of the visit the Amir Saud and His Highness the Shaikh accompanied by six of the former's and three of the latter's relatives dined (Arab fashion) at the Agency. By this time the Saudian brothers and cousins, who had been very silent at the beginning of the visit, had thaw ed considerably and were quite animated. The Amir Saud, who throughout had been most friendly and charming, was almost affectionate. He was certainly most outspoken, one of his comments being that it was high time that England used her increasing strength to give Italy a sharp lesson, as the latter country appeared to be completely out of control. The more peaceful suggestion that while one might forge a sword one need not necessarily use it, was greeted with an unbelie ving smile. 9. The Saudian party left for the mainland on Thursday morning, the 23rd December. The visit has been an unquali fied success and every one is very pleased. So far as I can discover its 'private' nature has been carefully maintained, and there have been no real political discussions. The fol lowing items of reported conversation are, however, of interest: (i) The Amir Saud is reported to have said that he was very pleasantly surprised to find that the A1 Khalifah Family was not held down in a position of inferiority in Bahrain, without prestige or power, as he had so frequently heard from other/-other sources# He realised now that the stories of Bri tish interference are untrue and that His Highness (act ing with the A1 Khalifah Family) was left to exercise freely his prerogatives as Ruler. (ii) The Prince exhibited very great interest in oil, and on a visit to the Bahrain Oil Company^ Refinery made notes of production and royalty figures. He remarked that the third share of the royalties received by His Highness amounted to a very large sum of money, but said that he realised that His Highness was extremely hospitable and generous to the poor, and that he felt sure that the money was being well spent. (iii) On one occasion Shaikh Mohammad bin *Isa, brother of His Highness the Shaikh, raised the question of Zubarah. He became extremely excited and shrill saying that it was unoearable that the A1 Than! should seize the home and tombs of the A1 Khalifah Family. His Highness rebuked his bro ther for his vehemence, and the Prince remarked that this was a subject about which men might well become vehement. After all, he said, the A1 Thani were nothing but animals! This, so far as I can discover, is the only justifi cation for the bazaar rumour that the main object of the Amir Saud's visit was to effect a reconciliation between Bahrain and Qatar. 10. It is interesting to note that the Saudian party orought a great deal of gold to Bahrain, one report putting it as high as 25 to 30 thousand sovereigns. Some of this had been left here in return for services rendered and a good deal more was spent in purchasing Maria Theresa dollars. It appears that a duty of 203 was imposed last month on the import of dollars into Hassay following large arrivals of/--5- oi 'this coin minted in Belgium* The Bahrain bazaar was short of* dollars but 70 f 000 coins were brought in by mail and were bought by the Saudi Arabian party, on which they will make their 20&amp; profit, as of course the Prince's party will be able to avoid the payment of duty in Hassa* They are also taking with them 11 motor cars presented by His Highness the Shaikh, some of them new and others rather part-worn. Cash presents to servants and followers amounted to at least Hs* 20,000/- and they have all been given new outfits of clothes. The cost to His Highness the Shaikh however has, I imagine, been well v/ithin Rs. one lakh, and so far as he personally is concerned he has enjoyed himself enormously throughout the visit, though he was beginning to look a little tired towards the end. The State will of cours pay the bill for entertainment at the Palace, but this should not be a very great sum. 11. There has been a certain amount of comment in the town on the extraordinary precautions which the Amir Saud took for his protection at night. He moved from the room prepared for him in the Palace to a smaller room on a high er floor, and the arrangement of the furniture was changed frequently, ©very one is satisfied that such danger as was apprehended came not from Bahrain but from his own entourage, which included his cousin Shaikh Khalid bin Mohammad. 12. It may be interesting to report that the Amir Saud received a telegram from his father three days after his arrival telling him to return not later than December the 21st as there was a great deal of work for him to do at home. The local expectation is that he is to be charged with duties corfesponding roughly with those of a Foreign Minister./-—K3pr Minister. His very weak eyesight rr»ay be something of an impediment. I have the honour tobe, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain. 'k£■ n iOP^O ACL LETTERS TO SB ADDRESSED TO THE EASTERN BANK LIMITED. TELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS EASTERTIDE.

Dollars, but 20,000 coins were brought up from IXibai and 50,000 arrived by the fast nail on December the 22nd, and these were bought by the Saudi .Arabian guests. They also purchased a certain amount of silk goods (normally subject to high duties in Arabia). It is estimated that owing to the absence of K.T. Dollars, they did not spend more than about Hs. 1,00,000 in the bazaar and that they are returning to Arabia with most of the sovereigns they brought.CONFIDENTIAL. u I beg to submit tne following note in connection witn the visit of H.R.H. tne Amir Saud to Bahrain DIARY* On lb-12-37 at 3.00.P.M. the Amir Saud arrived at Bahrain by 4 special launches 3 of which were sent from Bahrain to bring him from Al Khobar.

He landed on the Customs Pier and was met there by H.H.Shaikh Sir Hamad, all the members of the Al Khalifah Family, the Political Agent and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. As he landed a salute of 21 guns was fired for him. ^fter inspecting the Guard of Honour he shook hands with the Shaikhs and others who went to the Customs to receive him. He then drove to the Palace with H.H.the Shaikh where a large number of various classes of people went to wish him. a poem was read on his arrival at the Palace by one iibdur Rahman Al Muawdah, a youth of wuharra^. M) * On 16-12-37 at 10.00.A.M. the Political Agent, accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf(Captain Poland)called on the Amir Saua at tne PalaceThis visit was pre-arrang ecu At night a dinner party was given in his honour by Shaikh Muhammad bin f Isa at Muharaq. On 17-12-37 Amir Saud went to see the market by car and at night attendee a dinner party given in his honour by Shaikh 'Abdullah bin T Isa at Muharra^. On return from Muharraq, at about 9.00.P.M., he and H*H.tne Shaikh visited Al Roq, a Najdi merchant, in his house and then drove to K.B.Abdul Aziz al nusaibi's Office where they stayed for 10 minutes. For the noon prayers they attended the Jama r Mosque where a complimentary speech was read by Shaikh Abdullatif bin Saad, one of the 3 Sunni Qadhis. On 18-12-37 at 10.00.A.M. Amir Saud and H.H# the Shaikh called on the Political Agent at the Agency and left after staying 20 minutes. At night they visited Muhammad Al Qadhi, T Abdul Aziz Al 'Ali Al Bassam, Al Zamil I and Al Ajaji(4 Najdi merchants) in their houses and Jasim Kanoo, KhaliJ Kanoo and Haji Abdun Nabi Busheri in their shops. On 19-12-37 in the morning Mr.Ohliger, Managei of California Arabian Standard Oil Co., and Ibrahim Ridhawan, Saudi Government's Agent to the Company^ arrived in Bahrain and visited Amir Saud in the Palace. Later Amir Saud went to see the Oil Fields . At about 4.00.P.M. Amir Saud and H.H.the Shaikh paid a visit to the Mission Hospital where they were taken round and shown the different compartments. On 20-12-37 they were invited to dinner by the Adviser and later visited Yusuf Ali Akbar Ali Reza, Agent of Hasa Sinance Department, in his house where they stayed for about half an hour. On 21-12-37 Amir Saud and H.H.the Shaikh went to Rumaithah on a hunting trip and in the evening attended at Rafa' a dinner party given by Al Qusaibi to which the Political Agent, assistant Political Agent anu the notables were invited.S2 3. On 22-13-37 a dinner banquet was lie Id at tne Agency by the Political Agent to whicn were invited Amir Saud, his 6 brothers ana cousins, H.H.the Shaikh^, Shaikh Muhammad, Shaikh f Abdullah and Shaikh Salman and a number oi Britishers. The Amir was very grateful to the Political Agent and was pleasea with the arrangements which he described as an itnglo-AraD dinner party. On 33-13-37 at lO.Od.A.M. Amir Saud ana his retinue left for a1 Khobar by the same launches which brought them. He was accompaniea by K.B.Abaul Aziz, Abdullah ana Saad al s^usaibi. GENERAL. Amongst those who went to the Palace to wish Amir Saud were the 3 ounni ^adhis and two Shia’h Qadhis (Shaikh Ali bin Musa ana Shaikh Ali bin Ja T far). 2* It is said that the umir Saud had with him £.3000 gold and received a further sum of Iis.29,000/- from Hedjaz. He was expecting £.500 gold from Riyadh but the mohey was received at Hasa when he had left Bahrain. The Amir gave Rs. 18,000/- to the Shaikh's men, Policemen and Naturs and others during his sojourn in Bahrain. Most of the people who sent petitions asking for monetary help got nothing. Some people wrote letters to him requesting exemption from T Kosnan T pilgrim tax. Amongst these is Muhammad Tayib Khunji, a wealthy Iranian merchant who requested the Amir that import tax majr be waived on two motor cars which he contemplated to import into Saudi Arabia to convey his family to Mecca for the Hajj. His request,! understand, was granted. Amir Saua is said to have given a sum of Rs.5000/- as donation for the big Mosque in Mansmah. Most of the people were expecting that large sums of money would be distributed by the ^mir but tney were astonished to learn that this did not take place. \ Hi3. Tiie presents given to the Amir Saud are as follows •- 30 camels | 6 motor«cars | from H.H. 12 horses l 2 swords J Shaikh 1 dagger J 1 box containing necklaces, gold | watches ana other ornaments { 2 cars | From Shaikh Abaullan bin Usa 1 car I ' rl Muhammad bin f isa 1 car i ff ' Salaman bin Hamad presents to ^mir Saud T s retinue amounting to Rs.20,000/-. retinue purchased a large quantity of goods from the market to the approximate value of £.30,000 gold. Some of these goods were bought for Amir Saud but the major part is for their own benefit as they will be able to import them into Saudi Arabia witnout paying customs duty. Amongst the purchases made by the Amir Saud are 9 necklaces (7 of which cost its.9,000). 5. I heard that Amir Saud, on more than one occasion, expressed his resentment of the present state of affairs m Palestine. 1 particularly noticed that he was much interested in following the news concerning the German Colonies and the relations between Great Britain, Italy and Germany. 6. as regards the rumours in the twon about the object of Amir Saud f s visit to hahramo Some people were thinking that he has come to mediate in the Bahram- jatar conflict and others were saying that he has come to invite H.H.Shaikh Sir Hamad to go to the Hajj. It has now become evident to the people that H.H. has decided to proceed to Hajj. On 26-12-37 a telegram was sent by H.M.King Ibn Saud, to H.H.Shaikh Sir Hamad thanking him lot his hospitality to his son. It is said also that H.H.Shaikh Sir Hamad gave 4.

Houston-Boswall who is staying with me and I found them both delighted with results of meeting chief of which probably was dissipation of King’s intense distrust of Nuri who in turn appears to have been greatly impressed by Ibn Baud’s wisdom and now genuine good will. 2. We gathered that arrangements have been made to settle Shammar dispute by establishment of zone on both sides of frontier to be administered by ioint commission with powers of summary jurisdiction. Those Shammars who had migrated to Iraq since 1936 will be returned to Nejd. Trade agreement is envisaged.- Vague project of military alliance which was apparently mentioned to Ris Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad does not seem to have been pursued. 3. Hafiz thinks he has talked over Khalid hitherto 41 most anti-British of Ibn Saud's family. 4. Both ministers were immensely grateful to His Ma jesty' s Government for having facilitated this meeting.

I am convinced that the whole thing was a tremendous success. The difference in Nuri between the time he oassed through here on his way to Ibn Baud’s camp and yesterday was most remarkable. Last Thursday he was glum and pre occupied while yesterday he was cheerful and full of jokes. Little Hafiz was wreathed in smiles and greeted me as he got out of the plane with the words ; 'We have settled everything 3* I did not myself know that Khalid was so hostile; Kafiz said that he had been pretty bad but that he hoped that he had put that right. 4. Hafiz was also interesting about Philby. Philby never loses any opportunity of trying to poison the King’s end everybody’s minds against BiJitain, and apparently he warned the camp to be very careful of Doravile* whom he described as a British spy and a Shaitan. Hafiz got in a good one on Philby by remarking that there was not room for two shaitans in the King’s camp f and by replying with an expressive gesture to Philby’s enquiry as to the identity of tha first one. Philby wanted to return with Nuri in the H.A.F. ’plane but the King would not let him do so; and Hafiz says that his reason was he thought Philby would be «' The Honourable Lieutenant Colonel less /- C.G.Prior. C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire•eye as much as possible. It is amazing that Philby still draws a pension. 5. The King is said to be getting very tired of Berlin's laudatory references to him in the Arabic broadcasts.

Two American senators named Burton and Tunnell are making a tour investigating activities in Mediterranean and Middle East as members of Senate Committee investigating national defence. They are understood to be particularly interested in oil installations under American control and in oil matters. According to present itinerary, which is however to remain flexible, they were to arrive Casablanca end of December thence North Africa to Palestine visiting between January 12th and, January 14th Basra, Abadan and Bahrain thence to Cairo returning to the United States of America by January 20th. 2. Senator Burton is a progressive republican and has a strong support of movement to ensure full U.S.A. participation an effective world organisation. Senator Tunnell while not very prominent democrat has international outlook. The Senators will probably‘be in a great hurry everywhere, but His Majesty*s Ambassador, Washington thinks it will undoubtedly be worth while for us to show them any possible courtesies since Burton particularly is a reasonable and friendly individual. They are accompanied by Mr. Neader, Colonel Vaughan both Committee officials and Colonel Oates of U.S.A. General Staff. 3. I should be grateful if they could be given any possible courtesies at Bahrain. 4.
