Political Agent, Muscat. Subjects- Murder of an Indian British subject at Sur in Muscat territory. Reference paragraph 5 of Muscat Intelligence Summary No. 2 for period 16th to 31st January. 2. On arrival at Muscat in H.M.S. 'Bideford* on my recent tour, Major Watts informed me that the Sultan’s Representative had sent an official to Sur to investigate the murder, but without any tangible result. 3. I asked Captain Falconer if he could take Major Watts in Bideford to Sur to investigate the murder. Captain Falconer was good enough to do this, and Bideford left Muscat on the evening of 20th February, returning to Muscat on the morning of 22nd February. 4. The result of in his letter to the I enclose herewith. Major Watts* investigation is contained Sultan’s Representative, a copy of which This letter was sent under my instructions (Signature) You/ (Designation) S. 44. MFP—1048 SAP—(M-2042)—17-12-87—20,000.@ 2 You will see that I have suggested to the Representative that a fine might be inflicted by the Muscat Government on the tribal section inhabiting the quarters of the tov^n where the murder took place. (In the case oi the Indian murdered by the Shihuh tribe, a tribal fine was inflicted by the Muscat Government on the section of the tribe concerned, see correspondence ending with my Express Letter ITo. 758-S, dated the 26th October, 1957). I will report t; tative's reaction in due course. 5* The standard of security for the lives and property of Indian British subjects living in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf is high - especially having regard to the primitive conditions of law and order prevailing in some of those Shaikhdoms. In the lest 10 years there have been practically no serious cases, and only three Indian British 1 subjects have been murdered: the Shihuh incident referred to y tn. e; the murder of an Indian school boy - the murderer be in$ executed by the Muscat Government (after strong representa tions had been made), vide correspondence ending with r^y Express Letter Fo. 1^17/35/165, dated the 10th July, 1937, and the present esse. In oroer to preserve this standard of security it is, oi course, necessary to take as serious a notice as possible of any incidents which do occur affecting British subjects, otherwise the impression might get abroad that British subjects could be injured with impunity, and their position - especially in isolated areas such as Sur - might become impossible. Whatever the reactions of the Representative may be to Major Watts* letter, I have no doubt that the result of Bideford’s visit to Sur has been good. - RESIDEFT - The issue of the above has been authorised. — —&amp; Copy of a letter No. T/6/&lt;i39, dated tfte C^jKFe^S^TaTyj 1938, the from the Political Agent, Muscat at Gwadur tjo the seata t ive of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Omaln, !ttit£cjft [ 0 &lt;-) U j I 1933 After compliments: w„ , j’ Your Honour ^ill recollect that during the recent visit of the Hon'ble the Political Hesident he and 1 discussed with you the case of the murder of Kanji Purshotam, a Hindu Indian 6 ) British subject, at Sur on the night of the 27th January, 1938 (corresponding to the 26th Dhil Qa'dah 1356). 2. I had previously asked you to be good enough to send an official of the Muscat Government to investigate the incident, and accordingly you sent Hamad bin Hilal to Sur. V.hen the Political Resident and I discussed this case with you you informed us that Hamad bin Hilal had returned sometime previously from Sur and had proceeded to another part of Muscat territory. Prior to this date you did not inform me that Hamad bin Hilal had returned nor did I receive any report from you as to the result of his investigations at Sur. 1 venture to suggest that immediately Hamad bin Hilal had returned to Muscat 1 might have been informed of the result of his visit in view of tne importance of the incident in question. 3. fortunately the Political Resident had arrived in H.M.S. Bideford and acting under his instructions, and in company v&gt;ith Muhammad bin Bs dr whom you sent as Representative of the Muscat Government 1 proceeded to Sur on the warship to investigate the incident. 4. I arrived at bur on the morning of 21st February (coi res ponding to the 20th Dhil Hujjah 1356) and in company with Muhammad bin Badr and the Wali of bur made my investigations. The result of these briefly is as follows: Kanji Purshotam was an old man many years resident in Sur and on the night in question was sleeping in the courtyard of Vila j's shop. V i la j wae a Hindu friend of hie *ho had at the time a/a fairly large sum of money in his shop. Vilaj stated to me that on the night in question he was sleeping in his shop which is also his house when he was awakened by a door of his shop oeing violently shaken and heard a man shouting to him to open it. Vilaj of course did not open the door and shortly after heard a shot. He was too frightened to come out and investigate, but in the morning found Kanji Purshotsm dead in the courtyard shot through the body. V»ith the other members of the Hindu community he reported the matter to the Vvali who however was unable to trace the murderer. 5. The investigations of the Vtali and myself did not result .in any clue being found as to the murderers identity. As you are aware the town of Sur is divided into definite areas inhabited by the 4 following sections of the Jenebah tribe: 1. Arama. P. Ghayalin. 3. Fuwaris. 4. Makhanna. The murder took place in the Arama section whose head man is Shaikh Ha sir bin Ali a 1-Ha s ha r. The Hon'ble the Political Resident suggests for your consideration that if the actual murderer cannot be discovered, a fine might be inflicted by the Muscat Government on the Arama section living in Sur, thus enforcing the principle of tribal re sponsibility. The murder oi a British subject in a town under the a c tua 1 adminis tration of the Muscat Government is in the opinion ol the Political Resident a serious mattei' and one on which some drastic action should be taken in order to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.

After Compliments, With reference to Our letter dated 3rd Jamad Awwal 1356 ( 12th July 1937), regarding the murder of an Indian in the territory of the ShaiJch of Has al Khaimah of which one of Our Shihuh subjects of Bai'ah was accused. We have to state that in consequence of your demand from Our Representatire, during Our absence in Bhofar, to impose a fine of Bs 1000/- on the abovementioned Shihuh for their delay in sending the accused for trial and the incident which followed of the impounding of a boat which did not belong to the accused tribe, and the verbal discussions, and correspondence which took place between us on the subject, 4^ you learnt from Us that according to a report We received from the Wall of Sohar there were some date palms in that vicinity, belonging to the accused tribe. We have to inform you that We have received a report from the Wali of Sohar that he has arrested four persons from that section of the Shihuh and confiscated their 280 packages of dates and their date palms which are valued at dollars 3,000/- approximately.

It will Be recalled (see P.Z.766/37) that at the instigation of the Political Resident the Shihuh Sheikh was informed by the Muscat authorities that unless the suspected murderer was surrendered for trial by the 15th February 1937 a fine of Rs.1000 would be imposed on the tribe and would be realised by the sale of certain dhows impounded by the Muscat authorities, and that should the sale price be below Rs.lOOO the balance would be made up from the money found in the dhows. 3. The latest report below from the Resident indicates that the murderer was notto the continued absence of the Sultan from his capital the dhows could not be sold. Moreover on his return to Muscat the Sultan apparently objected to the sale on the ground that the owners of the dhows belonged to a small section of the Shihuh who had no dealingB with the remainder of the tribe and who had in fact always remained loyal and obedient to the Muscat Government. 4. At the end of April the Political Resident took up the matter personally with the Sultan and after a good deal of conversation it was finally agreed that if, after a further short period, the murderer was not surrendered, His Highness would give instructions for a date garden in Batineh to be sold up and the fine of Rs.1000 realised from the proceeds. On this understanding the Political Resident agreed to the release of the impounded dhows. 5. The murderer has still not been surrendered, nor has the Shihuh garden been sold up; but under pressure from the Resident the Sultan has now promised in writing that, if the offender bas not been surrendered by the end of July, he will then issue instructions for the Batineh garden to be sold up in order to realise the fine. 6. Further developments are now awaited.^* PJl.

The Political Agent telegraphed tnat tnie nad been dene, tmt tne dho^s were worth some ^s.300/- each, and that in addition a sum of Rf*.9i&gt;0/-, belonging to tne &gt;ninuh, nad been seized on tne dhows. The crews were allowed to return to their homes. 5. I was of opinion, and laptain Butler agreed, that no further i»ction was now necessary on the part of the Sloops. In the meantime further action had to stand over until tne return of Major Vatts from a royal Air Torce reconnaissance which was being made under his auspices. 6. On Major Vatte* return to Muscat I instructed him to request the Sultan* s Hepresentative to address r. letter to the Shihuh Sh&amp;ikh to the following effects That on account of non-surrender of Abdullah bin J&amp;l im, the suspected murderer of the Indian in question, t o dhows and Rupees 9b0/- nad been impounded. If Abdullah were eurrendered for tria 1 by 1st Tebruary dho.vs and money would be released. If Abdullah were not surrend ered a fine of Rupees 1000/- would be inflicted on the —.—-——&gt; Shihuh tribe by the Muscat Government and this would be realised by tne sale oi tne two dhows. 'hat should the sale price be below upees 1000/- tne balance would be made up from the money impounded. 7. The Sultan* s Representative suggested tn&amp;t the date of surrender should be advanced to trie loth February! I concurred, and the letter has been despatched. 8.

At an interview with the Wali of Khassab at Khor Kuwai on 13th November 1936, the Senior Naval Officer was informed by him that two Shihuh dhows from Bokha had proceeded to Matrah leaving Bokha on the 5th November 1936. The Political Resident and the Political Agent, Muscat, were so informed by signal and the two dhows were found and impounded, their combined value being in the nature of 500 - 600 Rupees. 2. In addition, a sum of 950 Rupees was found in one dhow and impounded. 3. It is therefore improbable that any further operations by Sloops will be required. (Sd.)V # S.Butler. CAPTAIN. SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER, PERSIAN GULF. msmZ.665/37 Extract from Persian Gulf Intelligence Re ort - November 1936. BAI 1 AH 2. With reference to paragraph 3 of the August Intelligence Report, information was obtained from the Wali of Khassab on 13th November, 1936, that two Shihuh dhows from Bokha were proceeding to Muscat. The Political Agent, Muscat, was authorised by the Political Resident to arrange for these dhows to be impounded by the Muscat Government, this was duly done at Matrah on 15th November, 1936. Rs.950 were found on board, this sum was also impounded, but up to the present it has not been determined whether it is shihuh property or not. The dhows themselves have been valued at Rs.300 each. Thus at present the dhows and money are held against the fine of Rs.1000 or the surrender of the murderer. The crev/s are being sent back to spread the news amongst the Shihuh and further operations are in abeyance until the effect of this seizure is known. The Wali also reported that Hasan bin Rahmah had been elected Sheikh of the Shihuh on 21st October, 1936, and had gone to live at Bai’ah. The previous Sheikh Mohamad has retired to live in Kumzar.

I couldn't help feeling that a certain amount of intelligence may have leaked out from Muscat, and that they knew not only of our impending operation but also of its subsequent postponement. It will be interesting to see what happens if and when it is decided to repeat it. Since my return here, however, I learn that movements are taking place in the local population/ population consequent on the end of the date season at Khassab, and that the re habit a ti on of Kuiaaar is due to this. !?his latter is probably the correct explanation. -*• » Any furt ication should be addressed to— The Secretary of the Admiralty, London, S.W.l Ifith jar -....1936. quoting 0A7fi4/Sfl’. 1 SECRET .

Sir, I have the honour to forward the following report in amplification of my 1717 of 9th August to the Political Resident, repeated to you. 2. DEPTFORD sailed from Khor Kuwai at 0830 on 7th August for Muscat to pick up the Political Agent, Muscat, and the Sultan’s Representative and thence proceeded so as to arrive at Bai’ah at 0445, 9th August, from South-Eastward, showing no lights at all, and having armed motor hoat in tow astern by that time. 3. SHOREHAM left Khor Kuwai at P200, 8th August, and arrived at Bai’ah similarly from Horth-Eastward. 4. Morning was hazy and time of arrival was deferred till 0500, ships sighted at about li miles. No craft of any sort were afloat and there were only four small fishing boats hauled up on the beach, and evidently not recently used. 6. A search of the coast was then carried out. SHOREHAM intercepted one medium sized dhow in Duhat Haffan; this was towed alongside DEPTFORD to be interrogated by the Sultan’s Representative. It proved, however, to be an Iranian owned dhow which had come from Ras al Khaimah to collect a cargo of firewood, and so was released. 6. The search was continued as *far North as Duhat Kabal, where both ships anchored at 1015, but no dhows of any sort were afloat. Three large and eight small dhows were hauled up on the beach at Limah, but judging from their appearance, the large dhows had not been in the water for som® months. 7. r\ The Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station. • • • • •7. After anchoring I went onboard DEPTFORD to interview the political Agent, Muscat, and the Sultan's Representative and it was agreed that no useful purpose could he served hy continuing the search any further. DEPTFORD was, therefore, ordered to proceed to Muscat and BHOREHAM returned to Khor Kuwai. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) V.S. BUTLER. CAPTAIN.

Further to my signal 1717 of 9th August, 1936, and your 1826 of 11th August, 1936, re operationsagainst B8i f ah. 2. From enquiries made from Nakhodas of various craft from time to time it would appear that there are only six pearling dhows owned by the Shihuh tribe. All of these come from Bakrah and operate during the pearling season near the Islands of YAS, HALUL end ZARKO. 3. All remaining craft are small fishing boats lightly built, no keels, of light draught (about 1 foot) and rudders are high and have little grip on water. Their capacity is about 20 bags of rice, i.e. l4y tons. They are usually manned by 6 to 7 men when they go fishing and then only a few miles off the coast; when they go diving for shells they keep within 9 or 10 fathoms of water and are manned by about 12 men. Their capacity is therefore less than a 26 feet service whaler, and their sea going capacity very much less. 4. In the summer it is the practice for the Shihuh male population either to take passage to the Trucial Coast in Debai or Has al Khaimah craft, where they then spend the summer pearling as crews of boats belonging to other Sheikhdoms. Those that do not go pearling retire inland to attend the date crop. Both these occupations cease about mid October, after which fishing is resumed. 6. The Sheikh of Bai f ah does not own any craft. Bai'ah possesses about 12 fishing craft altogether, the average value of which is not more than 180 Rupees, if as much. 6. Since it is the Sheikh of Bai ! ah on whom it is desiredto bring pressure, it is considered that operations should he confined to arrest of fishing craft between Bai’ah and Duhat Kabal. Although the question of tribal responsibility has to be considered, I am not at all anxious to extend operations north and west of Duhat Kabal, since Shihuh villages beyond this point cannot have been concerned, other than that they belong to the same tribe, and I do not wish to have embittered tribesmen from Kumzah, Khessab and Bakreh sitting on the doorstep when the naval base at Khor Kuwai is left in the hands of Muscat! caretakers, and also when sloops carry out their annual bombardment practices in Elphinstone Inlet. At present relations with these tribesmen are friendly, and they are supplying Khor Kuwai with fish, dates and other foodstuffs and water, and will be required to do so in the future. 7. Again, several separate operations are likely to be necessary in order to round up sufficient fishing boats to a value of 1,000 Rupees. The doubtful weather from November onwards, the lightness and unseaworthiness of the craft to be towed and the distance to Muscat, 170 to 180 miles, with no ports of refuge en route, render the safe towage of these craft a very doubtful proposition. Alternatively the arrest and detention of these craft alongside a sloop for an indefinite period whilst Sheikh of Bai’ah changes his mind seems an equally precarious proposition; although shelter could be found in Duhat Haffah or Duhat Kabal if craft could be towed there in time, otherwise they would have to be released in the interests of their own safety. 8. I would therefore suggest for your consideration that proposed future operations against Shihuh fishing craft should be abandoned, and that as a more effective alternative that Sheikh of Bai*ah should be informed that his fort will be bombarded on a date to be fixed, plenty of notice being given, and that on and after that date all Shihuh craft found between Bai’ah and Duhat Kabal, either hauled up on the beach or afloat, will be destroyed, the crews being taken off and landed; until such time as he hands over/ the 1,000 Rupees or the murderer. That any opposition offered will render the place in question liable to bombardment without further notice. It is thought that before this date the Sheikh will have changed his mind. (Sd.) V.S.

X then instructed Major Watts to suggest to the Muscat Government that tiiey should send a final latter to tne £h.ihuh. ohaiiui ashing for the surrender of Abdallah bin S&amp;lim* The Unseat Government have sent this letter giving tr*e fihihuh Shaikh until the 3rd July to surrender Abdullah. ?. I have been careful not to commit His Majesty’s Govern ment to any actions in tne first instance it was obviously a matter between the Muscat Government and the Shlhuh Shaiish and if the former coula have induced the latter to surrender the suspect for trial His Majesty^ Government would have nothing further to do in the matter beyond Major Watts holding a watching brief at the trial# In the letter which the Muscat Government have sent to the Shihuh Shaikh tnere is no mention of any action by His Majesty*s Government. At the same time the Sultan in his interview with Major Watts referred to above recognised that his State can bring no effective pressure to bear on the Shinuh Shaikh end has suggested that action be taken by His Majesty^s Sloops. 8. As will be seen,thorough enquiries incic&amp;te that there is a strong prime fccle case against Abdullah bin L&amp;iim. According to our information the Imian having engaged Abdullah to take him to Has al Kh&amp;imah actually set out in company aitli him. The next thing we heard about the Indian was his being found murdered in has al Khaim&amp;h territory and that Abdullah had shot him, taken his money and fled to the mountains. When the Shaikh of the Shihuh received the letter from the Muscat Government Abdullah bih Salim could have told tne Shaikh (if such hac. actually been the course of events) % that he had escorted the Indian to the horcers of res al Kh&amp;im&amp;h /-4- Kh&amp;laaii territory and there left him aafe and sound, an a the Shaikh could have repeated this account to the Muscat Govern ment, instead of which all the Shaikh die was to refuse flatly to surrender the accused# Further-M&amp;4®^’ Watts when pac»*3iii^ through Sharjah on his way to Kuwait to meet me, was informed by the Residency Agent, Sharjah, that he had heard on good authority that alter the murder of the Indian the Shaikh of the Shihuh had actually arrested Abdullah bin Salim but had released him under pressure from other members oi the tribe# 9 , With regard to the more general aspect of the affeir^ A British Indian having been murdered, unless some drastic action is taken by us, our prestige will suffer-i and the safety of other Indians residing on the Arab Coast may be imperiliea. On the general principle of His Majesty^ Govern ment coming to the assistance of the Muscat Government there was the case of Kliasab in May 1930 and of Sur in March 13bg# \ 10. If by era July Abdullah bln Sail* is surrendered for trial well and good. If not then I am strongly of opinion that the following action should be taken against the bhihuh Shaikh and his tribe. Ihe Muscat Government should forthwith impose a fine of Ks.1000/- on the tribe as a whole,and without any further communication to the Shihuh Shaikh the Sloops of as and when it suits them the Persian Gulf livision should/seise half a dozen of tne Shihuh dhows which will be more than sufficient to cover tne amount of trie fine. (This seising of dhows is similar to the action sanctioned by His Majesty’s Government in the Abu Dhabi incident - vide India Office telegram No. 1689 of 1st J.une 1935 and Governaentof Inf ia telegram No.141 ox i nd June 1935) • A representative of the Muscat Government should be on board each fcloop to identify Shihuh dhows. These dhows will be towed into Muscat harbour and kept there until the fine is paid, /pel&lt;2, failing which a number of them will be sole sufficient to realise the Rs*iQOO/~ 11. This action seems to me by far the best in t.ae cir cumstances. It is directed against the Sh&amp;iXh and the whole of his tribe, thus enforcing the principle of tribal responsibility, it is the minimum punishment necessary to servo as a deterrent against further muroers oi BritiSii Indians, and to prevent loss of our prestige which will occur if no action is taken. Further it allows the bloops concern ed to choose their own weather in which to tow the dhows to Muscat * the Senior Naval Officer in discussing this mato er ■frith me laid stress on the difficulty there might fee, naving regard to the lives of the dhow crews, in towing the dnows in stormy weather. 12. I would be grateful for sanction by telegram for the proposed action to be carried out. 15. It will be noticed that considerable time has elapsed since the murder took place,but tnis was inevitable in oraer to allow of investigations to be made and to permit Ma^or Watts an opportunity of having an interview with tne Sultan at Dhofar. sd.

T.G.Powle, O.B.P*, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India New Delhi. Affairs at Sur Sir, I have the honour to refer to correspondence \ 3&gt; ending with your despatch No.P. 570-N/31, of 7th Lay 1932, and to report for the information of the Government of India that Sur has remained quiet since the action taken there in March of last year, and that the authority of the Muscat State, then restored, has continued undis turbed. 2. On Shaikh ALi’s submission the Question of what terms he should be given by the State was discussed by His Highness the Sultan, the late Sir Hugh Biscoe, and myself - as Political Agent, Muscat. Shaikh Ali having persisted in his rebellious attitude almost literally up to the last minute, and having only submitted to an ultimatum of bombarding and bombing from sloops and air craft which had to be concentrated at Sur for the purpose, obviously deserved scant sympathy. On the other hand from certain practical considerations both Sir Hugh and I were in favour of the Shaikh, having actually submitted, ‘even though with a bad grace, being treated as well as co 'possible under the circumstances. There was no question of his apprehension and imprisonment: the points to be decided centred round certain allowances and privileges(75y which he claimed, 3. The Sul tar,, on being approached, was &lt;iuite prepared to treat the Shaikh well, and of his own accord proposed tbe following terms (a) Continuance of his - the Shaikh f s - previous political subsidy of $ 1200/- per annum. (b) In addition the granting of / 600/- per annum, a new and special allowance as * compensation’ which the Shaikh had claimed for the loss he would be put to on the State, instead of himself, tawing customs dues from Aiq_a. (c) Continuance of personal exemption from customs dues on certain articles which the Shaikh, and his predecessors, had enjoyed. These terms are, considering the circumstances, very liberal, and indeed more generous than I would have thought fit to suggest to His Highness. Under (a) and (e) the Shaikh continued to receive his old allcv r ances , and under (b) is granted a new one. 4. Shaikh Ali was accordingly informed that while by his rebellious attitude he had_ ipso-facto forfeited all his privileges and allowances, nevertheless His Highness was prepared to treat him kindly, and that he should come to Muscat and discuss matters with the Sultan. He objected / to this, insisting that His Highness should come to Sur. The Sultan not unnaturally was of opinion that the Shaikh should come to see him, and as His Highness then proceeded on tour to India, matters hung fire. Since His Highness* return a desul£tory correspondence has been kept up betv/een the Shaikh and His Highness, the former sending some boorish missives which the latter has treated with commend able patience. Since it is now the Shaikh who wants some thing from the State, and not the opposite as formerly, time was not of much importance so long as the Shaikh continued to obey the authority of the State-which he did. Some weeks ago, however, I suggested that, if the Sultan approved, Major Bremner, with a representative of His High ness, might visit Sur and have a personal interview- with Shaikh*9 ' ^ 1 Sbaikb Ali. His Highness concurred, and on the 17th February Major Bremner, with a representative of His Highness visited Sur in a sloop, kindly put at. his disposal by the Senior Naval Officer, and had a conversation with the Shaikh, during ?/hich the situation, and the terms which the Sultan is prepared to offer him, were once more explained. Shaikh Ali himself is rather a weak character, swayed by his evil advisers, two individuals named Abdullah bin Ahmad Bawaf and Khamis bin Saiyid Sainaidi , and as on this occasion these were not present, his attitude was friendly and sensible enough. After a long interview with Major Bremner and the x Sultan f s representative, which lasted - so Major Bremner informs me - without intermission from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Shaikh Ali finally wrote a letter saying that he would come to Muscat to see the Sultan. The latter has issued him with a special invitation to do so, and a safe conduct for coming and going, which the Shaikh was anxious to have. There .the matter now stands.

I beg to submit for the information of the Commander-in-Chief the following report of the measures taken against Sheikh All bin Abdullah al hamudah of the Bani bu Ali section of the Ja’alan at bur to enforce his submission to the authority of the Mascat State. 2. Having received the concurrence of H.M. Government to punitive action, contained in Admiralty message dated 19th February, 1932, timed 1716, I arranged for H.M. Ships BIDEFORD, FOWKY and SHOREHAM, and the three units of 203 (F.B.) Squadron, Royal Air Force, to rendezvous at Mascat on Wednesday, 2nd March, 1932. I also arranged for the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to be disembarked from 8.S. VA8NA on 1st March and conveyed to Mascat in 3 H OR EH Ail. 3. I arrived at Mascat on Tuesday, 1st March, and embarked in FOWEY. BIDEFORD and one flying boat, S.1433, were also in harbour. During the afternoon Group Captain W.L.Welsh, D.S.C., A.F.C., Officer Commanding 203 (F.B.) Squadron, arrived at Mascat in S.1434. 4. During the evening of 1st March I discussed the question of the Sur operation with Group Captain Welsh and the Political Agent and Consul, Mascat. The latter informed me that Captain R.G.E.W.Alban, I.A., Officer Commanding the Mascat Levies, had left Mascat for Khor Jarama in AL SAID on 26th February with 100 levies. I also received a copy of Captain Alban’s letter dated 29th February, addressed to His Highness the Sultan of Mascat, outlining the proposed scheme for the defence of Sur and the aircraft base at khor Marama by the Mascat Levies, and a copy of Royal Air Force Operation Order No. 1 of 1932, No. S.10673. I learned too that five dhows loaded with war materials, petrol and oil for the aircraft had left Mascat for Ahor Jarama on 26th February. 6. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in H.M.S. BHOkBHAM, and Rangoon S.1436 arrived at Masoat on Tuesday, 2nd March. 6. On 3rd March His Highness the Sultan of Masoat end the Political Agent and Consul, Maeoat were embarked in BIDEFORD, and Group Captain Welsh embarked in FQWEY, and wi th ....with the Political Resident in SHOKi&amp;iAtf the three sloops left Masc&amp;t that evening and arrived at Bur at 0630 on 4th March. 7. During the forenoon of 4th March, the Sultan ordered a small customs post to be established at Aiq&amp;, it being considered that opposition was extremely unlikely with three sloops present. The post was, however, opposed and the customs officials were forced to return to their boat at the point of the rifle. The Sultan therefore sent a letter to Sheikh All, who at the time was away from Aiqa, Informing him of the action of his people, and warning him that if the customs post was not accepted by noon on Monday, 7th March, Alqa would be bombarded and the Ja'alan fort bombed. The Political Resident also informed the Sheikh that the Sultan's letter had his full support. A copy of the Sultan's letter was sent to the people at Alqa with a warning on the same lines. 8. On Saturday, 6th March, I issued Operation Order w B.B.0ne M . 9. During the forenoon of that day the Sultan received a letter from the people of Alqa stating that they had no objection to the customs poet, but as the letter was unsigned the Sultan replied that he could not accept it unless the people would show their good faith by sending off to his ship six headmen to apologise to him and to escort the customs post ashore and establish it. A very non-committal reply was received to this. 10. The three flying boats which had remained at Masvat were ordered to khor Jarama by the morning of Sunday, 6th March. The same forenoon, after embarking the Political Resident, PQWEY left Bur and arrived at khor Jarama, where the Political Resident and Group Captain Welsh embarked in the aircraft. The aircraft left Khor Jarama during the fore noon and carried out a demonstration, including the dropping of pamphlets (see Appendix 'A* to Enclosure Mo. 2), over Ja'alan fort and Aiqa, and returned to Khor Jarama in the afternoon. 11. While at Khor Jar&amp;ma I landed and inspected the piquets established by the Mascat Levies. I consider that the arrange ments which had been made for the defence of the aircraft and stores were fuost efficiently carried out. 12. After re-embarKing the Political Resident, FOWEY returned to Bur the same evening. During the day parties of men arrived at Aiqa, being greeted with much enthusiasm and firing of rifles, and in the evening Sheikh All himself arrived at Aiqa. The next morning the Sultan received a very truculent letter from the Sheikh, complaining of action having been taken before his arrival and questioning the erection of the Mascat flag over the customs post. The Sultan then reminded Sheikh All of the time limit given him for the acceptanoe of the post and stated that it was the practice of the Mascat State to fly its flag over all its customs posts. 14. At noon that day, the customs post not having been accepted •••accepted, the Sultan wrote to the Sheikh warning him that his Ja’alan fort would be bombed, and Aiqa bombarded on the morning of Wednesday, 9th March, thus giving him time to remove his tribesmen from danger, with this letter he for warded notice of bombardment and bombing. In the meantime a further letter was received from the Sheikh laying down the terms on which the customs post would be accepted by him, • but the Sultan replied that the time for discussion of terms was now past, and that four men should come off to the ship to escort the customs post ashore. This reply was accompanied by the warning letter forwarding the notices of bombardment and warning, and a further letter from the Political Resident to the Sheikh, advising him to make peace with the Sultan and accept the post while there was yet time. 16. Next morning, 8th March, the Sheikh sent off letters to the Sultan and Political Resident accepting the customs post, and four men to escort the customs post ashore. The customs then landed, accompanied by the four men of the Ban! bu Ali, and the post was established and the Mascat flag hoisted above it. 16. In view :fthis surrender by Sheikh Ali, he was informed by the Sultan that the proposed action would not now be taken. He was invited to visit the Sultan on board to discuss the question of allowances, but in spite of persuasion by the Political Resident, the Sheikh steadfastly refused to come off to the ship and said that he would either meet the Sultan ashore or send nis brother. The bultan, aowever, would not agree to this. He informed the Sheikh that he would be available on board BIDEPGRD until noon, 9th March, but the Sheikh still refused to come off to the ship. 17. Pinal warnings were sent to Sheikh Ali by the Sultan and the Political Resident, informing him that his future treatment depended on his loyalty and that of his tribe to the Mascat State, and the Sultan left Sur in BI&amp;EFGRD at noon, 9th March, for Khor Jarema. On arrival there His highness inspected the Mascet Levies, the latter were embarked in BIDRPORD, and the ship left the same day for Mascat. where she arrived the next morning, and disexabarked the Sultan, the Political Agent and Consul, kascat, and the Mascat Levies. 18. I have arranged for BIBLFGRD to remain in the vicinity visiting Sur occasionally and reporting any change in the situation. 19. H.M.S. FOWST, and SHGREHAM with Political Resident onboard, left Sur for Mascat p.m. Wednesday, 9th March. * XXX 21.

This showed that ti^ fort • was a most conspicuous land mark* well clear of the village and ar^ideal target for bombing, opportunity was also tajten to make a reconnaissance of the Khor Jarama and nas al hadd area am to test the laming grounds at Bait al jfalaj *ear Muscat/Muscat and Has al Hadd* Captain Alban, as Comaandant oi the Muscat Infantry, accompanied the aircraft to rihor Jaraxaa and lias al Hadd and over the iiani Mu All country. Unfortunately, during this reconnaissance one eapiti crashed on the coast near Quryat, about 40 miles ® uth of Muscat, but tlie occupants escaped unhurt and were sub sequently brought in to Muscat by a dhow which was sent for them. They had a narrow escape as the land there is a tangle of broken hills, and it was a fortunate chance that when their engine petered out they happened to be over about the only place where landing was in any way feasible. 3. I left Mu shire by mail steamer on the 2tith ifebruary and transhipped to h.M.b. “b horchaa * which the Senior naval Officer kindly sent to raeet me off tfarur Island the following afternoon. The itesidency Agent was on board and 1 was able to have a discussion with him regarding Trucial Coast matters, we dropped him at hasv al-Khalraah on the 1st march and arrived at Muscat on the 2nd .MaxBh There I found Hieua^esty^ ships “Migdford* and 'Fowey* and three flying boats of ho. 203 Squadron. The Senior haval officer had arrived by mail steamer from Bombay while Mx«qB Group Captain Welch had arrived by air from Basra. It had been decided that flying boats should use Khor Jararaa as a base and petrol, oil, bombs, ete. , had already been sent out there in some dhows which were escorted by the 'Al said!' carrying 100 men of the Muscat Infantry under the command of Captain Alban. These men were to guard the stores and flying boats when they landed at Khor Jararaa in view of the possibility of the Bani Bu All attacking them. Pickets were estaolishad on some of the hillocks surrounding the khor, while the Shaikh of Has al Hadd sent out a screen of guards to a distance of about 15 miles towards the Bani Bu All country/• t ' . • ' 1 ®^&gt;W i3flB tS&amp;SLQ*$&amp; *|© ©X^fSiid” .a vo . -., o. oartoc^.i ;! o Aai st Ai ani-jnsj %t ^ • n^fw X** ‘ BMW ^tti&amp;OAL BIWiW BOMlq \&gt; ,; . mmr t a y H . v j *j ’ fain i&gt;aqqtni» s® ♦a-xsXJ»j!

It was not considered necessary in these circumstances to await his arrival and it was thought desirable to take prompt action and to show that the time for negotiations had passed. A letter was therefore sent ashore by his Highness to the people of Aiqa informing them that the customs post would be established and soon after a guard consisting of four men bearing the Muscat flag landed at Aiqa. There, however, they met with a hostile reception from some forty of the inhabitants, were threatened with rifles and a dagger was taken away from one of them and they therefore retired to bur. 6. theu-.M&amp;ii un this Hlg High ness addressed a letter to Shaikh All informing him that the Muscat state hud sent some customs officers to Aiqa to establish the post there in accordance with former custom, and that his tribesmen at Aiqa had threatened the customs/customs guard with rifles and refused to allow them to remain* He (Hhaiich All) was warned that unless he sent instructions to life people not to resist the establish ment of a customs post the fort at Mqa would be des troyed by ships and the fbrt at Balad Ban! Bu Ali bombed by aeroplanes, and that the people of Aiqa should tome on board the ship and inform His Highness by noon on the 7th March that they were willing to accept the customs post# I also aent a letter to the shaikh informing him that the Sultan’s demands had the approval of his Majesty’s Government, who were prepared to support them. It was necessary to give the people of Aiqa time till Monday morning in order to nait of a message reaching Jaalan, where the shaikh was, and bring a reply. A copy of these letters was sent ashore to the people of Aifa. A reply was received from the people of Aiqa ask ing His Hi^iness* forgiveness and pardon and saying they would give an answer on Monday* 7* The following day it was decided to carry out an aerial demonstration over Jaalan, am to drop pamphlets giving a preliminary warning to the people that if they resisted the fort would be bombed. I there fore proceeded with Group Captain welch on the bth in H.M.B. '♦tfowey* to Khor Jaramu, where tio*ee flying boats had arrived from Muscat. Group Captain welch kindly allowed me to accompany the flight and the three flying boats proceeded down the coast to Juraailah whence we struck inland to Balad Ban! Bu Ali. on arrival I was able to see for myself the extensive date groves owned by the Bani Bu Ali am the Bani Bu Hassan tribes in this lertile valley and also the fine fort belonging to the : 'X former. Having dropped the pamphlets we returned directto Khor Jarama. and. then went on without landing viqa, over which pampliletB were alao dropped, and then we then returned again to jKhor Jaraiaa* There I inspected one or two of the pickets of tine Muscat Levy Corps and saw the arrangements made by Captain Alban for tine protection of the Koyal Air Force base. It is certainly a very much better place than Muscat for flying boats and I believe the Royal Air Force intend to uae it in preference to the latter in connection with the Aden air route. I was told that a good deal of smuggling went on through the khor and that it was the intention of the Muscat state to establish a customs post there. This would have the advantage eu&amp; in addition to stopping smuggling that the guards could assist the Royal Air Force, while visits by flying boats from time to time would afford moral support to the guards. I then returned in h.M.b. «Fowey M to Aiqa t and arrangements were finally completed to take action against the Bani Bu All should they prove recalcitrant. 8. It was decided that if they did not send a satisfactory reply by noon on the 7th joirch action would be taken against them at daybreak on the 9th t and that an ultimatum to this effect should be issued by the . Senior haval Officer to the people of Aiqa, while tlia flying boats xxx would drop the final warning over Jaalan on the morning of the 8th 9 telling the people to remdve their women and children to a place of safety. 9. However, on the evening of the 6th Hhaikh Ali arrived at Aiqa and the following morning sent a letter to His Highness the cult an which was most truculently worded. In it. after acknowledging receipt of His High ness* letter, he wrote: “You have hastened lie re before *my arrival and your promise was for the end of the of••• 'the month, and you are warning us for fighting* I see 'you want that* If you wiah to fight without a cause 'then do as youjllke* Injustice will punish her own 'children* Moreover the flag was not mentioned in your 'conditions nor in those of the resident'. To this his Highness replied that the shaikh must accept the establishment of the customs post by noon and if he did not receive a reply by that time it would be under stood that he intended tcjoppose the post* as regards the flag the Shaikh was informed that it was the custom of th&lt; Htate to fly their flags over all their customs posts in all their ports* The Shaikh's objection to a flag being flown over the customs house was quite Illogical, since the Muscat flag is always, and.when he wrote his letter. flown over l^iqa fort 10* To this the shaikh replied in a le iter in which l he repeated the terras which had been offered to him by the State at the interview in December last; but did not express his readiness to accept the customs post, but stated that he would not come off to the ship to see His Highness but was prepared to discuss matters ashore either at Aiqa or at sur. A meeting of this nature / would certainly have been derogatory to His hi^mess 1 dignity, and it was evident that the shaikh was endeavoiur &lt; ing to prolong discussions, the tine for which had passed, and to evade the issue. 11* This letter wqs not received till about 2 p#m*, that is two hours after the time given for acceptance had passed, when it was received His Highness therefore 4 had aready written him a letter which had not yet been sent ashore saying that, as he had not complied with his orders by noon, the fort at Aiqa would be bombarded and the fort at Jaalan bombed by aeroplanes but that in order7 to enable hie tribesmen to escape from danger this m&gt;uld not be done till Wednesday morning* and he enclosed tor his information a notice addressed by the aeniOr naval Officer to the people of Aiqa and also a notice to be sent to the people of Jaaian, She notice issued by the Senior naval officer was to the effect that the tort would be bombarded four hours after sunrise on March 9th and that anyone remaining in the town after that time would do so at the peril of his life* whilothe notice regarding Ja&amp;lan was a copy of that which was to be dropped the following morning by the aircraft over that tow. To his Highness* letter I added one from myself to the .shaiJch advising him to make peace while there was yet time. On receipt of Shaikh All's letter mentioned above his highness therefore addressed another letter to him inlomiiiH, him that the time for the discussion of terms and conditions had passed and that he required four men of the Bani Bu Ali to come off to the ship ana take the customs guard ashore to Aiqa. he reiterated thatthe Muscat state had the right to fly its flag any of its official buildings and stated that the future conditions to be grafted to the Bani Bu Ali depended on their future behaviour. If they behaved as loyal subjects of the Jit ate the Muscat btate would treat them well* but if they persisted in their rebellious attitude they would be punished. Both letters were sent ashore together with the notices of boribc»rdr&gt;'ient • at Aiqa between the shaikh and his tribesmen and I under stand that some at any wate were in favour of withdrawing to the interior and refusing to accept the state's demands. During the discussion* however, some half a dozen of the apparently told the Bani Bu Ali that it was rediculous to That evening prolonged discussions took place Jennebah rdiaikhs from Bur went over tato* to Aiqa and try and resist and that they had much better climb down* and/? \ooel&gt;A ' ' I 1 ftd 'l:&lt;&gt; K H r -e- and this opinion carried the cCa^« If this version which xs was reported to roe is correct, it furnishes a typical example of the difficulty of dealing with these semi- savage tribes of 'Oman, and shows how easily they are swayed by outside influence* When I prevailed upon Shaikh All to haul down his own flag and to fly the Muscat flag in August 1930, it was largely due, as X reported at that time, to the conciliatory attitude adopted by zx&amp;tttk Abdulla Hawwaf, a local priest. My failure to arrive at a jiXkx settlement last December I attribute largely to the same cause* his highness the hultan was convinced on tiie present occasion that the Man! bu All would not climb down as the loss of face would be vexy great, but the outside influence of certain Jennebah shaikhs turned the scale, coupled, I believe, with that of Hawwaf, who huiy4ome to the conclusion that he had miscalculated the determination of His Majesty's Oovern/ient. 13. Anyhow, early dn the morning of the 8th, the Sultan and I both received letters from shaikh Ali, in which he said that he noted that his highness required four men of Aiqa to land along with the officers in order to establish the customs post and to fix the flagstaff. They were being sent as desired, his highness replied that the four men had arrived find he had sent for the customs officers who would be sent to Aiqa in due course to fix the flagstaff and establish the customs post* lo this he received a reply from the {Shaikh saying; have 'accepted your demand about hoisting the flag on the roof bf the house which is arranged for the four persons. 'Please send them on M , and about noon on 8th March the xmado customs guards were escorted ashore and the Muscat flag Mmx hoisted over the post, which has been established in a sniiu enclosure at the entrance of the creek which the Bani Bu Ali had themselves built in order to enable them to levyillegal dues onfiiiowu entering After thia had been clone His Highness wrote to [Uiaikh Ali offering him safe conduct to cone on board and diacuas matters if he wished to do bo and stated that I also would be present, while the benior naval uffic er simultaneously sent him a letter withdrawing the bombard ment ndtice. &amp;haiich Ali, however, still declined to come off to the ship, while expressing his readiness to rnc;et the Sultan ashore, his Highness therefore proceeded that afternoon to Jthor Jarama where he inueflcted his jxjvy corps, and on the 9th we all left for nuacat. before leaving his highness wrote to tshaikh Ali informing him that the future conditions to be granted tejhim depended on his future behaviour, he had accepted the establish ment of the customs post but he and his people had still to prove their loyalty by paying customs dues without evasion. If loyal the# would be treated well. I address ed him a le tter in the same sense and warned him thatjif Xfr the customs guard were molested or id the people tried to [ evade payment of c us toms dues it would bt as though he uad . not accepted the post and measures would be taken against him but that if on the other hand he and his tribe amen at Aiqa acted as loyal subjects of the Muscat atate j^was confident that atate would treat them with their customary generosity, lo this I received a letter of which 1 enclose a copy. It will be seen that the tdiaikh states definitely that he lias accepted the customs post and that there/will be no molestation of the guards or evasion of customs dues though he adds “if the sultan pays \diat is agreed ••between us H . r io this last stipulation I do not think any great importance need be attached, he has been definitely informed that the former terms are no longer open to him, and I think it is merely an attempt to get something If he can. un the other hand if the ham hu- 10 - behave well It ia the intention of niu hi^neas to con tinue the political subsidy and the personal exemption on a specified amount of goods imported for the ahaiich. 15, After our departure #.*.»• “biaeford* was left in the vicinity Sor about a fortnight, and has visited 3ur and Aiqa on the north am no incident has so far been reported to rae, and, tfriile I hesitate to express an opinion that there never wiljjbe any more trouble at Aiqa, 1 think the outlook is favourable, and if we have succeeded in effecting a final settlement at a place where we have had difficulties on and off for the last century we shall certainly have cause for congratulation. The S matter should soon be put to the proof, since the Aiqa dhows will be returning from Africa before the monsoon, f.e. during April, am if they pay their cub toms dues and accept the situation loyally a good beginning will have been made. 16. Moreover, we are in a very much stronger position nowadays to control the situation and to overawe opposition than we were formerly for two reasons. firstly, there is no doubt that the flights of aircraft over Jaalan had an enormous moral effect; hitherto these tribes residing in the interior and largely self-supporting have considered themseifes invulnerable. They now realise that they are not. If, as seems probable, tnc refuelling base is established at Khor Jarunm and aircraft frequently visit this coast, their constant presence will prove a most useful reminder to the inhabitants of the interior. The second factor is the discovery of the great climatic advantages of Khor Jarama, which is only 10 miles from nur, in the summer for his majesty*s ships, formerly ships seldom visited this part of the »uraan coast but now sloops are constantly sent down for ten days at a tine toJararan in the euminer is a very valuaDie tonic. The people of yur therefore are nowadays constantly Tisited by ships and the local children are even beginning to kick a football about and to speak a few odd words of &amp;W&gt; : ~'h English picked up from sailorol All this should have a very valuable civilizing and pacifying effect. Moreover these visits of ships enable the Muscat atate to keep in close touch with 3ur. 17. If 1 may say so, 1 think the course of events may be regarded as satisfactory. The Muscat btate have displayed the utmost forbearance and tolerance of a gross flouting of their authority, before extreme measures were resorted to the most generous terras were offered to Shaikh Ali but when finally it was obvious that he was persisting in his former attitude an over- whelming demonstration of force was made before which he had really no alternative but to yield ana which was so strong that it proved unnecessary to take action. Finally the action taken was singularly opportune, a young and energetic Sultan has just ascended the throne, and there is no doubt that the action taken at Aiqa will have wide repercussions and will enormously enhance his y prestige, improve *he revenues of his state and facilitate his dealings with his subjects. 18. In conclusion I would venture to express ray thanks to the ‘Jenior naval officer, -errian uulf Division, ana to uroup Captain welch for the valuable support they have given to the political authorities in the Persian liulf and for the harmonious manner in which they co-operated to carry out my wishes.

Sir, ^ M 1 i lf~&lt;, 3 n I have the honour to acknowledge the Receipt of Foreign and Political Department letter To .P.570-1/31, darted the 17th February 1932, regarding the situation at Sur. '/&gt; — 2. There would seem to be some misapprehension regarding tue position at Sur, and as this may possibly have arisen from the fact that I did not in my previous letter mane the matter sufficiently clear, 1 would venture with all deference to xM&amp;Ki: submit the matter again for the reconsideration of the Government of India. 3. The Government of In ia state that it was a mistake for the Political Agent to have visited Sur until he had secured definite authority to put the business there through, by the use of force, if necessary,and further that both the Officiating Political Resident and the Political Agent should have realised that it was almost,if not quite,impossible for the Political Agent and the President to visit Sur in one of His Majesty’s ships and land there without directly ram sing the question of control at Aiqa,and that, even if it had been possible, a mere visit of inspection would have contributed nothing to the solution of the problem. i.MoLOSUHt 4 N x would venture to say that I do not think this view INDIA FOKfclGN SlMinAKY‘B i no ether correct. On the contrary, it would have been SI MAR.ignite possible for the Political Agent and the President to j 1Q APR 1 ^ 'I Letter Dftted Received 18 APR. 1E32 ...JiaJM—jcisited 3ur without raising tVie question of control at Aiqa at all. Sur is a largish town with a large number ofof dhows and is a fairly important co .imercial centre a&amp; such places go in Oman. Aiqa is a small hamlet on the opposite side of the creek. It was certainly necessary to tackle the question of control at Aiqa for two reasons: firstly, because of the possibility of smuggling through Aiqa,and seconuly,for reasons of prestige. The Jenebeh would not have submitted indefinitely to the stricter control being exercised over them by the uscat State if the Bani Bu Ali in xxiqa had been openly able to resist, but the matter was not one of immediate urgency. The Political ^gent ana the President had already visited Bur on at least two previous occasions without raising the question of control at Aiqa, or approaching the Bani Bu Ali. There was no reason why they should not do so a third time, and actually the Sultan and the Political Agent only recently again proceeded to Sur in K.B.S. but of course did not interview the Bani Bu Ali. This is what the Officiating Political Resident thought they would do. 5. A new customs house was being built at Sur, a new Shaikh of the Jenebeh had recently been installed,and efforts were being made to improve the customs organiza tion there. All these matters demanded constant supervision and it was desirable that when any of His Majesty’s ships happened to be visiting Sur, advantage should be taken of it by the President of the Council to go down and inspect the place, and such visits had become more or less matters of routine, and in view of the fact that the Political Agent had been told tnat he was to submit his plans for effecting control at Aiqa. and that the visit to Sur was merely to be one of inspection, I would submit that the Officiating Political Resident was entitled to assume that the question of control at Aiqa would not be takentaken up on this occasion. It could certainly perfectly well have been avoided, and I think the Political Agent was wrong in advising the President to send for the ^ani Bu Hli. Ay own view, therefox'e, is that the Political Agent and the President of the Council could well,and should, have gone to 3ur on an ordinary visit of inspection,and that it was unnecessary for them on this occasion to have raised the question of Aiqa, and in view of the instructions issued to him the Political Agent should have definitely refrained from raising the question. I do not think,therefore, that, in common fairness, the officiating Political Resident can be blamed because action was taken which he had ordered not to be taken. 6. I took advantage of my recent visit to 1'uscat to coiiL:.uni cate the gist of the remarks contemned in the letter from the Government of India under reply to Captain Alban. He admitted that he and the President of the Council could have gone to 3ur without interviewing the Bani Bu Ali, but informed me that on a previous occasion when the President of the Council had visited our, leaders of the Bani ^u Ali at Aiqa had spontaneously and of their own accord come over and paid their respects to the President of the Council. When therefore he suggested sending for them on the occasion of the October visit neither he nor the President of the Council imagined that it was likely to lead to any incident that would bring matters to a head, and as a matter of fact the first interview was quite friendly. This explains Captain Alban’s act ion , wi thou t I think altogether justifying it, but as he urged it on his own behalf I have thought it desirable to put it before the Government of India. Cne thing is most clearly demonstrated,and that is the extraordinary unreliability of the character of the semi- savage Arabs of the Oman Coast, and now difficult it is to forecastforecast or foresee their reactions to tne most innocent measures or proposals, a fact of whicn I have had very convincing experience myself in the last six months. I fully anticipated,judging from my previous experience of him,that When 1 visited Sur in December last I should be able to persuade Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah to accept a customs post at -aiqa: the influence of Shaikh Abdullah bin Rawwaf, the local priest, V'as thrown into the scales against me and I failed. During the recent operations at Sur His Highness the Sultan of Muscat was convinced that the Bani Bu Ali would not accept the customs post without some show of resistance: the Shaikh’s first letter was very truculent and His Highness argued that the Jenebeh, Bani Bu Hasan and other tribes were watching,and that the loss of H Sharaf M would be tremendous if they climbed down without any resistance. My personal xxsi view was that the mani Bu Ali would yield to 'force majeure' and would tacitly accept the post,but would never give any formal undertaking in writing to do so and would try to do something to save their face. Actually what happened, I understand, was that after the ultimatum was issued a council of w a r was held, end the general opinion was in favour of making some show of resistance. Then some four or fiure of the leading Shaikhs of the Jenebeh went over to xiiqa from Sur, and advised the Bani Bu Ali 'not to be fools', and we have now obtained from Shaikh Ali not merely a written acceptance of tne customs post, but a further letter from him, in reply to mine warning him against molesting the post or attempting to evade customs, to the effect that he has instructed his people not to molest the post, and to pay their customs dues. The climb dov/n has been complete and abject. It remains to be seen whether theythey adhere to it* but the generally expressed opinion on , i '3 - j the coast is that their-'-ire Si's tan ce is definitely crushed. I have etc.. Sd.

After careful consideration of the facts the Government of India are unable to avoid the conclusion that the incident at Sur on October the 27th, 1931, which resulted in a public rebuff to the Political Agent ana to the President of the Muscat State Council, woula not have occurred if the officers concerned had mere justly appreciated the requirements of the situation. The position at 3ur was one of great delicacy and although the Government of India had no objection to the President’s visiting the place or even to his doing so in one oi his Majesty*8 ships in token of the moral support oi i.is Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, it seems to them obvious that it was a mistake for the rolitical Agent to do so until he had secured definite autnority to put the business there through, by the use of force, if -r*~«.v. n-e-fM **4®t.tnir Political Resident and thethe question of control at Aiqa y and that 9 even if it had been possible* a mere visit of inspection as suggested by the Officiating Political Resident* would have contributed nothing to the solution of the problem. The Political Agent moreover in spite of having been warned that his visit was to be merely one of inspection had no sooner landed at 3ur than he advised the President to send for the Bani Bu Ali * and in his own words 'thrash the matter out with them*. In the opinion of the Government of India therefore the Officiating Political Resident committed an error of judgment in permitting the Political CL Agent to go to Sur in^ Hi's Majesty^ ships even on a visit of inspection and the Political Agent by his conduct on arrival there went beyond the authority which had been given to him. 3. The Government of India have no doubt that these errors arose through the natural eagerness of the officers concerned to get the Sur question satisfactorily settled and they have no wish to take too serious a view of the consequences or to hamper unduly the exercise of initiative by their officers, but the fact remains that a situation, the result of which can only be to render the problem of restoring control at Aiqa less easy of solution* has thus been created and I am to request that* if you see no objection, an intimation in the sense of the remarks contained in this letter may be conveyed to Major Powle and Captain Alban. 4. As regards the interception, on the high seas and in territorial waters* of Aiqa dhows by the uscat launch and Levies* the Government of India agree that inthe circumstances created by the visit to 3ur the course adopted was perhaps the only thing that could be done to restore the prestige of the Muscat State authorities* But they cannot forbear to observe that if the grant of such authority to the Kulers of the Arab States in the Gulf became common, the consequences would obviously be in the extreme undesirable* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- E• B.

II. POLITICAL BEST TENT 1 3 VIEWS - NOVKLiBSB 1926. 3. On 24th November 1928, the then Political Kesident telegraphed to the Government of India that the situation at Sur must be considered to be a domestic problem of the Muscat State, but in advancing this opin ion he left it to be inferred that H.M.Government should assist the State in some way to solve the problem. The question was how far H.M.GoTsrnment were prepared to advance on the policy, then being followed, of bolstering up the Mascat State. III. POSITION 1XJBTNG 1929 to JAN GABY 1930. 4. Throughout 1929, it was recognised by everyone concerned that the situation at Sur was moat unsatis factory. In January 1930, the Political Resident addressed a despatch to the Government of India dealing with the whole question of Maeoat. In this despatch he made proposals for dealing with 3ur, but as the position at that port was of a long standing nature he did not consider that any useful purpose iK&gt;uld be served by taking action in a hurry.

'TRIAD** • He mt the various sectional leaders of the Jenebeh and adviyed them to settle their differences. He promised to return to visit them later in the year. They seemed disposed to lay their quarrels before soriie neutral arbitrator for settle ment. They were informed that Sheikh aII of the Bani bu Ali, the self-otylea Amir of Ja’alan, was himself a dependent of lasoat and had no authority to interfere in their affairs. Furthermore they were informed that his independence would never be recognised by the British Government, whatever overtures he might make with that object in view. 7. on 10th August, 1930, the Political Resident received sheikh ixli of the Bani bu Ali on board 'TRIAD' at Sur. The Sheikh was accompanied by Sheikh ??ohamed (MUllah) and Sheikh Khamis of the Senedah Section of the Bani bu All. at the end of a long drawn out conference during which Sheikh Kohamed, the Sullah, used all hie powers of persuasion to prevail on sheikh Ali to he sensible, the latter agreed to haul down the Wahabi/ Ja'alan flag and to replace it by a mso&amp;t flag at iiqa. He also admitted that he had no claim to be independent of the State of J'lascat, or to collect customs on his own account. The private fl§g was struck accordingly and ao fj.v as is known the ? as oat flag has flown at Aiqa ever since* 8. On 16th September, 1930, Saiyid 3a*id bin Tairaur (Heir Apparent to the Sultan) paid a visit to sur in the • •.. •in the armed veaael AL SAID. He waa well receired by the Jenebeh and remained in the town for seren days. During thia and a subaeqaent Tiait towards the end of 1930, he composed the Jenebeh sectional feuds, and appointed a paramount Sheikh orer them. Saiyid Sa'id visited Aiqta, end was received with a gun salute. He found the State flag to be flying over Sheikh All’s fort. on 30th September 1930 an emissary arrived at Mascat on a friendly mission from Sheikh All to Saiyid 3a*id. 9. On 20th November 1930 the Comm&amp;nder-in-Chief, accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, visited Sur and were accorded a friendly reception. Report of Proceedinga dated 13th August 1931, , Ho. 181/587, paragraph 23. 10. On 9th July 1931, S&amp;iyid Sa’id bin Taiaur arrived at Sur in PEHZANCE and landed with thirty followers. During this visit, which lasted for about a week, he collected arrears of customs and tightened up the customs organisation in Muqrimatain. With the full approval of the Jenebeh he laid the foundation stone of a new customs house on the point at the entrance to Sur Creek, apposite Aiqa. Later he investigated the possibi- bilities of erecting a customs post at Khor Jararaa during another visit which he paid to Sur between 29th July and 5th August, 1931, when he took passage in H.M.S.HASTINGS. During this second visit Saiyid Sa’id had an interview with Sheikh All, who put forward exorbitant demands which were rejected. Report of Proceedings dated 20th November 1931, Bo.£71/587, paragraph 6. 11. On 26th October 1931, Saiyid Sa’id, accompanied by Captain R. G. K. W. Alban, I.A. (Acting Political Agent at Masoat), landed at Sur from H.M. S.PEHEANCIC. On this occasion Saiyid Sa’id felt sufficiently confident to approach the inhabitants of Aiqa with a view to including Aiqa in the costoms jurisdiction he had so successfully established at Muqrimatain. He also wished to persuade them to register their dhows. A conference was arranged, but the Bani bu Ali tribal representatives refused to attend. Instead of authorised representatives they sent low class natives to meet Saiyid 3a*id. They evidently Intended to insult him. The Wall of Sur (Saiyid Saif bin Badur) was sent to Aiqa to prevail upon the leaders to abide by their promises to attend the meeting. Saif is a weak individual and did not exert his influence or authority to the desired end , so his mission failed. Saiyid Sa*Sft had no force at his disposal to compel the Aiqa leaders to obey him, and so he had to leave Sur without having achieved the object of his visit. On his return to Mascat he ordered thfarmed vessel AL SAID to proceed to sea to intercept Aiqa dhows, then on their way to Sur with cargo from Basrah. One such dhow was captured and has been detained at Mascat pending a settlement of the Aiqa customs question. YI. . . .VI* RK3ULT3 DQRIHCr 19 80 AHP UP TO 1ST KOVS^lBgR 1931. J£ • results of nearly two years' quiet work may be summed up as follows:- (i) The inter-aecttonal blood feuds of the Jenebeh referred to at 6 (a) abore hoye been settled. (ii) A paramount Sheikh of the Jenebeh has been appointed and is recognised by the Jenebeh sections as Sheikh of Muqrimatain. (See 5 (b) above). (iii) Sheikh All was persuaded in August 1930 to recognise the suierainty of the Government of Muscat (see 5 (c) above). It appears, however, that his acceptance of this principle was not whole hearted and it seems that he agreed to it with reservations - possibly because the conference took place on board one of H.lfUdhips. (iv) Sheikh Ali definitely agre#d to haul down the Wahabi flag at Alqa in 1930 and has since flown the Muscat State flag. It does not appear, however, that the flying of the Muscat flag is considered by him to give that Government any claim to exerwlse legal rights in Aiqa or in Ja'alan territory. (See 5 (d) above). (v) The customs administration at Sur, or rather on the Muqrimatain side of Sur, has been tightened up considerably. (Ses 5(e) above). A new customs house has been erected near the entrance of the Greek. 13. These results, such as they are, have been achieved without any active display of force. But it must be realised that the principal actors on the side of the Maacat State have had on several occasions the moral support of H.M.Ships, known by the local people to be in the vicinity. furthermore, frequent visits have been paid to the neighbourhood of Sur by H.1C.Ships in the ordinary course of duty, or for the benefit of the health of the respective ships' companies. VII, GENERAL remarks or situation as it existed tn govilBER' 19317 14. All political and financial authorities agree that Sur is a problem vital to the State of Mascat. The 'de facto” ruler of the State - Saiyid Sa'id bin Taimur - has given evidence of capacity to rule and of determina tion to solve the many problems which confront him in his task. His proceedings at Sur, or rather those in refer ence to Aiqa have precipitated a crisis, but the crisis was bound to arise sooner or later. Apparently the Government of India are prepared to continue to bolster up the State of liaaoat , as it exists to-day; in fact. there . •there eeeme to be no alternative for if the State dis integrated, a possibility which Is ever present, the carefully built up position of the Indian Government on the Korth-^ast coast of Arabia would collapse* and short of relinquishing their Interests on that coast into other hands, which might not be too friendly or too easy to deal with, the hands of the Government are forced by the turn of events, 15. In short the State of Uaecat must not be allowed to dlslntegxrte; if the Sur/Ai*a/Banu bu All problem is not solved in the near future disintegration of the State la assured. Some solution of the problem must be found, it is an urgent necessity and is vital to theory existence of the State. 16. The Council of Ministers had been warned in a friendly way by Sheikh Isa bln All of the Imamate Gov ernment as late as last spring that, unless effective steps are taken at 3ur, the tribes of the interior will be compelled to act. It may be possible to disregard this warning, because it is doubtful whether he has the means at his disposal to take effective action himself; but his position might become stronger at any moment and once hia tribes are roused to action it would be diffi cult to arrive at any ’modus virendi* under which the Mascat State would not suffer. 17. Again, once the Bani bu All have succeeded in flouting directly and deliberately the authority of the Mascat Government with impunity, they might feel them selves strong enough to push home the advantage. It Is easy to visualise that Sheikh All might attack the Wall of Sur, might interfere with the lately established order in Muqrimatain and in doing so would probably up set in one blow the good work which has been effected so carefully and tactfully during the past two years. The Bani bu All have interfered in Muqrimatain affairs with in the past ten years with disastrous results - inter ference at this moment would be even more disastrous to the State. VIII. gKOBLGUS RKMAIHIHG TO SOLVED IH DECEMBER 1931, 18# h»rly in December 1951, the following problems awaited solution;- (i) aheikh All of Bani bu All to be prevailed upon to recognise the auserainty of the 3tate of Mascat without reservations. (ii) Sheikh All to be persuaded to cease collecting customs on his own account at Aiqa and to recognise the right of the Mascat Government to do so* (iii) To arrange for the registration of Aiqa dhows.(iv) To tighten up tht customs adiainistration in relation to the Aiqa side of Sur Creek. IX., ACTUAL. rOGXTlOH AT SUR NOV .V3&gt;3R AN:) PECK^I^R 1931. 19. Muqrimatain and the Jenebeh were quiet and appeared to be maintaining their loyal attitxide towards His Highness* Government. 80. The tribes inland were taking a keen interest in the march of events. ^ 21. Sheikh Ali and Sheikh Khamis were established with about 300 men at Aiqa. 22. Thirty Levies under Seiyid Saif bin Badur had been sent by sea to Sur, but had returned to Muscat a few days later without having accomplished anything. 83. Sheikh Ali had addressed a truculent letter to the Council of Ministers calling upon it to release the Alga dhow captured early in November. In rerly he was informed that the Political Resident and Saiyid Sa’id would be coming about 13th December to discuss the matter with him. Sheikh Ali therefore marked time at Ai&lt;ia, while the Political Resident (who had resisted proposals put forward from the Muscat Agency thrt H.M. Ships Bhould immediately co-operate with the State forces) put himself in communication with the Home and Indian Governments. He was authorised to inform the Sheikh that H. . Government will not tolerate the defiance of the Muscat State. The question of what forcible measures are to be taken if the Sheikh proved to be obdurate was left for consideration until the effect of the warning was known. 2Ls M'a TINC AT OUR 13TH - 14TH DLOKHBJR, 19bl. 24. The Political Resident in S.S. CHAKLA and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf in H.K.S. TRIAD arrived at Sur on 13th December, 1931. Owing to the heavy seas running it was impossible to effect a landing, but a message was received from Sheikh Ali that he was holding himself ready to wait ui&gt;on the Political Resident at any place of time convenient to him. 26. On 14th December a landing was effected and a conference was held on shore in Sur, at which were present The Honourable the Political Resident. Saiyid Sa’id bin Taimur.

They Maintained that they had never recognised the over- lordehip of basest - they were always independent of that State «* they had sometime© been compelled to pay taxes and crus ton© under dureor, in fact they would not admit that such dues were ever paid by their tribe at Aiqu** or anywhere else, in such a way ie to admit the ICaseat claim to collect the money as of right* If Mascot liked to pay Sheikh All on annual r/ubsidy that was the 8tate , s affair; it was not evidence against the Bani bu All; it merely showed that H.1U Government had acme interest in doing; so, or alternatively that it owed the money* As for the money itself the Sheikh did not want it, a email subsidy here and there did not interest him in the leaet. He had plenty of money and could well do without the subsidy if the fact of it© payment encouraged the State to make extravagant claim© to jurisdiction over the Bani bu All and their own ©eaport Ai&lt;£a. The events of the past had created no precedent co far a© they were concerned* 32. In view of this vmcomprojnioing attitude, the Political Resident found it necessary to Inform them that the British Government would not tolerate any defiance of the Mas eat State and were prepared to a ©cist H.H* Government in the rurcuit of their Just aim©. H.M. Government hoped that these outstanding questions could be settled peacefully; the Sheikh wa© being offered generous term© by Mascat and confirmation of his own ami his tribe©* local right©; he was asked to think the matter over before giving a final decition which raight involve hi» in a fruitless struggle with the British* The Gheikh and his advisers intimated that they did not need time to think the matter over; they regretted thet H.M.

If this involved the.a with the British, it was an honour to fi$it such on Empire and they did not care what losees they suffered in such an honourable etruggle. 33.

(1) The Government of India have taken care to pass on the Secretary of State’s proviso about previous air demonstrations and warnings before punitive operations against Jaalan. They have also taken the precaution of sending Colonel Biscoe a copy of the instructions regarding the control of air operations on | the North West Frontier. The operations, which were to have begun shortly after 24th February (when Colonel Biscoe would have arrived at Muscat), have been V postponed for about a week, as the Navy and Air Force require more notice. (2) Please see the Government of India's letter dated 29th December, 1931, flagged X (P.Z. 386/32), to which the letter from Colonel Biscoe now submitted is a reply. It was unfortunate that in the earlier stages of the attempt to restore Muscat State authority m Aiqa the Political Agent, Captain Alban, was inclined, as Colonel Biscoe has stated privately, to Vush his fences'. Captain Alban had dealt with the matter very well up to a point, and evidently thought that if he and Saiyid Said went to Aiqa on board one of H.M. Ships and had an amicable discussion with the Beni bu Ali, the whole matter would be settled without further trouble. Unfortunately it was not: on the contrary, they were subjected to a good deal of indignity. The reason for the objection by the Government of India to a suggestion made to the Muscat Government that they should intercept Aiqa dhows is not very obvious, and Colonel Biscoe’s reply in paragraph 8 seems to be adequate. (3)/ /(3) The Admiralty for some reason seem to find it necessary to send separate instructions to the Commander-m-Chief, East Indies (although the S.N.O. is in close touch with Colonel Biscoe), and have now done so. They had asked us for 'immediate information' if the Government of India's proposals were approved, and I had ascertained demi-officially from the Admiralty that a copy of our telegram would suffice. The telegram was sent on the night of the 17th, but unfortunately a copy did not x reach the Admiralty till the 19th. The department concerned, who are rather sore because the Chief of the ^•ir Staff persuaded the First Lord to act against the departmental advice in this matter, have apparently taken this very much to heart, and have protested m an official letter.

From To The Hon*ble Lt.Colonel 11.7.318006, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to Foreign and Political Department letter No.F.570-N/31, dated the 29th December 1931. In this the Government of India said that they were inclined to doubt whether the procedure adopted in the earlier phases of this attempt to restore the authority of the Muscat State in Aiqa was not calcul ated to lead to a situation of some embarrassment, and they question^ed the wisdom of the Political Agent’s action and also of the course of action suggested to the Council of Ministers, namely, the interception of Aiqa ^liows by . a Muscat launch. 2. The facts of the case are as follows. On the 30th September the Political Agent telegraphed to the Acting Political Resident that Saiyid Said had asked for a pa sage in a sloop and was taking 50 levies with him in the launch with the intention of completing the customs control over Aiqa, and had invited the Political Agent !08(j ^ to accompany him. Captain Alban supported the proposal ; ^DIA FOREIGN SEen-Af’-s ‘ Lettor f, 0 ftnd stated that there would be no difficulty.

He instructed the Political Agent to explain this clearly to Saiyid Said and stated that if Saiyid Said and the Political Agent were confident that the sloop*s presence under these conditions would give him the necessary moral backing to carry out what he v anted in view of success already achieved he was prepared to approach the Senior Naval Officer. 3. The Political Agent telegraphed back stating that both he and Saiyid ^aid had every confidence of success and that the latter asked for support in the event of unforeseen hostility. Major Powle telegraphed back that he would submit the matter to me when he met me at Kuwait on the 22nd October on my return from leave, but that in the meantime the Political Agent should send him a letter there explaining what Saiyid ^aid proposed to do to complete the customs control over £s Aiqa. •4. On the 19th October the Political Agent addressed a further telegram to Major Fowle saying that H.M.S. -Penzance” was visiting Sur on the 23rd October and that Saiyid Said would be glad if he could be given a passage and had asked the Political Agent to accompany him. ITo this Major 3?owle replied that he had no objection but presumed that the visit was merely one of inspection, and that passages would be arranged direct with the Commander of H.M.S.'Penzance'. 5. When Major Towle met me at Kuwait on the 22nd October he discussed the matter with me and we were both agreed that in order to complete the authority of the Muscat State over Sur it was essential to deal ultimately with the 3ani 3u Ali at Aiqa, but we did not decide on any definite time or method of action and I said I would await a report from Major Fowle on the subject after his return to Muscat. Ve neither of us anticipated that the issue would be definitely raised in view of the fact thatthat Captain Alban had been told to submit proposals for action at Sur for approval* and that ! r ajor iowle had telegraphed to him that he assumed the visit in 'Penzance H was merely an ordinary visit of inspection* 6. On the 28th October,hoTvever, 1 received two telegrams from Captain Alban saying that the Bani 3u All had refused to come and interview fcaiyid Said and himself and had defied the ^ali* Captain Alban stated that this insult called for prompt and exemplary punishment and suggested a number of exceedingly drastic measures* namely^ that the Havy should watch for Aiqa boats at sea and ghould blockade Cur* and further that he should take charge of the levies and occupy Aiqa fort. From ( these telegrams it was evident that Saiyid ^aid accompan ied by the Political Agent had definitely raised the issue of Aiqa, despite the fact that the latter had been instructed to submit his proposals for prior approval, and I think he was clearly wrong in doing so* Major 7owle did not wish the issue to be raised until he had consulted me* and I was not prepared to recommend any action at Aiqa until X had received 14aj or Fowle’s detailed report* and told him that only on the very strongest grounds would I recommend any steps being taken there till the following summer* The time to take action at Aiqa is when the dhows have all come in for the Cummer, namely, in June or July. It is then comparatively easy to bring pressure to bear on the local inhabitants. Captain Alban however was, I think* over-confident that no diffi culty would occur and raised the issue without awaiting definite authority. 7. On the other hand, it is clear from the Council of Ministers’ letter of the 30th October to the Political Agent, a copy of which was forwarded to the Government of IndiaIndia with my despatch No.C.l of 30th November 1933% that Saiyid b a id did not take up in any way an aggressive attitude towards the Bani Bu Ali. All he asked them to do was to come and discuss matters with him, and the first evening they did so, and adopted a very concili atory attitude. The next morning, however, they appear to have got alarmed, and instead of the leading men returning themselves they sent a number of individuals of no importance whatsoever to represent them and with whom it was obviously impossible for Saiyid Said to discuss matters and whose very presence was insulting to him, and even when tr e la ter sent the Wali to ask them to appear before Saiyid ^aid they refused to do so; While therefore I think the Political Agent must be aixxacjEji blamed to some extent for allowing the issue to be raised at all it can be urged on his behalf that actually it was raised in a very harmless manner. It was the intention of Saiyid Said and Qaptain Alban to have an amicable discussion with the people of Aiqa, and if they adhered to their refusal to pay customs dues, then to submit proposals for dealing with the situation. It was only the insulting behaviour of the Bani Bu Ali at Aiqa that brought matters to a head. 8. As regards my own action in authorising the Muscat State to seize an Aiqa dhow by their own means if opportunity offered, I would submit that it seemed desirable, from the reports that I had received, that some notice should be taken promptly of the conduct of the Bani Bu Ali. The State had asked through the Political Agent that His Majesty’s Ships should arrest dhows belonging to their own subjects, etc., to request of this nature I was not prepared to accede, but I sww no objection to their taking action against their own subjects by their own means if they chose to do so. Juridicallydo so either within territorial waters ou on the high seass it was a case of a sovereign State taking action with its own forces against its own subjects. The question of the legality of action on the high seas would only have arisen if they had been taking action against foreign subjects, not against their own subjects. I saw no poli tical objection to such action since I was of opinion that the move might do good and might induce the Bani Bu Ali to see reason, and at any rate would show them that the Muscat State could retaliate against them, while it would do no harm, since the matter could not be allowed to rest where it was without affecting the whole position at Sur, though I was determined to make every effort to effect a settlement by peaceful means x if possible. My failure to do so was a great disappointment to me, and as mentioned in my telegram No.T.130 of 15th December 1931 I i attribute this failure largely to the influence of a local mullah who has resided in Jaalan for some years past) of Hejazi origin, he subsequently resided for some years in Cairo and Syria, and undoubtedly exercises much influence over Shaikh Ali. At my previous interview he was helpful and conciliatory. On the present occasion he Was exactly the reverse, and prated of the League of Nations and President Wilson*® fourteen points, and though I had a long private talk with him, and endeavoured to enlist his support, it was not forthcoming, despite the fact that the Muscat State went to the utmost limits of conciliation, and offered to compensate Shaikh AJ.i for any pecuniary loss he might sustain for the loss of customs revenue at Aiqa, and assured him that they had no desire to interfere in his tribal affairs in t he interior provided he admitted their rights on the coast.

They apparently think that the Air Force are being brought in to do the Navy's work, a feeling which is perhaps intelligible in view for instance of Colonel Biscoe's letter of 28th March 1930 (P.&amp;&amp;O2/30) paragraph 4 and similar strictures on the ineffectiveness of bombardment from warships* There does not seem to be any real substance in their objections, which are dealt with in the draft below, and it is certainly curious to find the naval wolf in the humanitarian sheep*s clothing.

He notes th t an aerial demonstratlin will in fact preceue hostile hL r action, and that the usual warning to evacuate the place designated as a target will be given. 4&gt;« He further observes that in the case of IQiassab to which Iheir Lordships have referred, the headquarters of the recalcitrant Sheikh w&lt;*» accessible from the sea, but in // the present instance the aemolition of Aiqa fort would not by itself seriously affect the Sheikh + as is apparent from the Eesident* s telegram of the 8th January enclosed in this ufi zn, x jl Office^ letter of the «th January, «i^/ 3H - and prompt// and firm action not only on the coast but also against the headquarters of the Sheikh in the event of his rem inlng recalcitrant, is evidently considered desirable by the authorities immediately concerned. 5* Their Lordships have further referred to the loyal attitude of the Beni bu Has3an and to the possibility of stopping su pplies for the Beni bu .-li ©t Sur. The Secretary of State agrees that the offer of assistance from the Beni bu Bassan is likely consi erably to strengthen the hand of the muscat Government, but he observes that the probability of such m eventuality was present to the mind of the Besi-ent ( s shown by his telegram cited in the preceding paragraph) when he made his recommendation, and s not in effect altered the circumstances of the case* J0 r 6. As regards the possibility of instituting a blockade, the Secretary of St te presumes that in view of the fact that the tribe is resident ini nd and is probably more or less self-supporting, it must be extremely doubtful whether such a scheme would prove effective. In this connection he notes from the Hesiuent’s telegram of the i£ th May 1930, forwarded on the same date unaer cover of this Office printed letter ho. P# 3 029/3 0, that the success of the blockade at £hass; b was only due to the impossibility of rationing that place by land. 7. In conclusion, the Secretary of State ventures to draw Their Lordships 1 attention to the f ct that the re-eommendaticns which he proposes to approve have the concurrence of the Government of India and were f amed after discussion with the Senior Itfaval Officer and the Air Officer Commanding; they h ve also received the assent of the two other Imperial depart :»nts concerned* Sheikh -li has been informed that steps will be taken shortly to enforce compliance with the i.uscft Government’s dem nds, and any delay or vacillation in dealing with the situation would have a bad effect. The Secretary of State earnestly trusts, therefore, that Their Lordships will now agree to the approval of the recommendations, in view of the fact that aerial demonstration will irecede pi^itive ii r actioi, )j and that due care will be taken to avoid the risk of unnecessary casualties or a greater measure of damage than the e i re urns t anc e s dem a n d* 8.

It appears to the Council that the views of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty as expressed in this letter are due to misapprehension. It seems, for example, to be inferred ( 1 ) that air action as such necessarily inflicts more than the ’’minimum punishment necessary” to produce compliance; ( 2 ) that it is taken without due regard to the avoidance of loss of human life; (3) that it is likely to have ’’repercussions” unfavourable to British interests in the Persian Gulf; and lastly (4) that the separate use of naval and air action would be preferable to a simultaneous employment of both methods of coercion. 2. The Secretary of State for India will be aware that - — % . although suggestions as to the ’’inhumanity” of air action and &gt; J X . as to a ’’legacy of hatred” from its use have been made from time to time, these suggestions have not been supported, but definitely controverted by actual experience of air operations. When in 1925 the Government of India expressed their considered views on this aspect of the bombing of tribesmen they stated that ” 0 f personal rancour over air operations, or of retaliation on women or other individuals there has been no sign” and again ”We do not think that the danger of alienating the well disposed /elementselements in a tribal community by the use of aircraft is a real one”, (C.I.D,141-D). This opinion, based as it was on the collated experience of political officers in touch with the tribes should, in the Council f s view, dispose of the misgivings expressed in the Admiralty's letter as to the effect upon relations with the Arab rulers in the area concerned and the fear that relations between the tribesmen and the personnel of the Royal Navy will become embittered. There is, of course, much independent testimony by senior political officers in Iraq and elsewhere to the same effect. 3. As regards the particular apprehensions disclosed by Their Lordships' letter, the Council would further observe:- (a) That it has been an invariable principle among all three fighting Services of the Crown that when force has to be employed to achieve the objects of H.M. Government ^the degree of force recommended should be the minimum considered likely to achieve the end in view. This principle has been, and will be, applied no less rigidly by the Royal Air Force than by the other Services. (b) Air operations against the habitations of tribesmen not in open war against H.M. Government have never been undertaken and never will be undertaken, except after all possible action has been taken to reduce loss of life to a minimum. It has been, and will continue to j be, the invariable practice for tribes to be warned that a village is liable to be bombed and should be evacuated. Moreover, the demonstration suggested in the Admiralty letter is, as the Secretary of State for India will be aware, the invariable preliminary to air operations of the nature proposed and may, as has frequently occurred, render them unnecessary* (c) The view apparently held by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty that the bombing of Jaalan Fort will adversely affect the relations between H.M. Government and the tribes elsewhere in the Persian Gulf area, especially in regard to the Arabian air route, seems to the Council to be unsupported by any evidence. Experience on the North West Frontier of India, in Iraq and in Aden leads rather to the conclusion that the discriminating use of aircraft against one tribe or section results in an improvement in relations between Government and other tribes or sections in the same area. Indeed the Council take the view that, if one /recalcitrantrecalcitrant ruler finds that by retiring inland out of reach of naval bombardment he can be defiant with impunity, others will be quick to appreciate our weakness and to take advantage of it by raising all possible difficulties and objections against every proposal for the implementing of British policy in the Persian Gulf* In fact, it is due to the recalcitrant nature of the tribes beyond the reach of naval bombardment that our negotiations for the establishment of the alternative civil air route to India have been so prolonged. (d) The Admiralty proposal that naval action should be undertaken alone in the first instance might lead to a recurrence of the stalemate which occurred in 1928 under almost similar circumstances. On this occasion the fort was destroyed and the sloop retired, whereupon, in the words of the Resident in his confidential despatch No. 688-S dated the 28th December, 1929, ’’after its departure, the Beni Bu Ali had resumed their occupation of the customs house and re-hoisted the flag ” The present proposal by the Resident, Persian Gulf (in which the Air Officer Commanding and the Senior Naval Officer have both concurred), has doubtless been put forward in the light of this experience; indeed in his confidential despatch No. 137-S dated the 18th March, 1930, to the Government of India, the Resident states in regard to these proposed operations at Sur that ”1 agree that action by warship alone would be entirely ineffective; past history has shewn this”. 4. The Council are, therefore, of the opinion that the apprehensions expressed by Their Lordships are not justified. They consider, on the contrary, that these operations, | carried out under the normal safeguards that have been in force for ten years, will not only give the best chance of achieving their object quickly and humanely but should also result in a closer understanding between the Services as to the nature of each other’s work and the benefits of co-operation. Copies of this letter have been sent to the Admiralty and Foreign Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,AIR MINISTRY. ADASTRAL HOUSE. KINGSWAY, W.C.2. 3rd February, L932 bear ''.alton, Our conversation yesterday about bur Air Vice-Marshal Burnett and Clauson on the subject of the Admiralty's views on air participation and the Resident's proposals for joint action, I enclose a copy of a letter which will shortly be coming over to you officially. Yours s' J.G. Walton, Bsq., C.B., M.C., India Office, S.W. 1.&lt; s SECRET. February, 1932. S.29210/S.6. Sir, I am ooimnrnded by the Air Council to refer to Admiralty letter Ro. M.0141/32 of the 29th January, 1932 (a copy of vfoich was received by the Air liinistry), on the subject of the proposed naval and air action at Sur. The views of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty as expressed in their letter rest on several serious mis apprehensions. It is inferred (l) that air action as such necessarily inflicts more than the 'minimum punishment necessary' to produce compliance, (2) that it is taken without due regard to the avoidance of loss of human life : (3) that air action is likely to have 'repercussions' unfavourable to British interests in the Persian Gulf : and lastly (4) that the separate use of naval and air action would be preferable to a simultaneous employment of both methods of coercion. 2. The Secretary of State for India will be aware that although allegations as to the 'inhumanity' of air action and as to the ‘legacy of hatred' from its use have been made from tine to time, these allegations have never been sustained in the actual experience of air operations. ,ihen in 1925 the Government of India expressed their considered views on this aspect of the bombing of tribesmen they stated that ’Of personal rancour over air operations, or of retaliation on women or other individuals there has been no sin' and again !T Wt do not think that the danger of alienating the well disposed elements in a tribal community by the use of aircraft is a real one'. (C.I JJ.141-1)). This opinion, based as it was on the collated ex perience of political officers in touch with the tribes should, The Under Secretary of State, (Rolitieal Department), India Office, s.w. _in the Connell’s view, dispose of the misgivings expres ©d in the Admiralty’s letter as to the effect upon relations with the Arab rulers in the area concerned and that the relations between the tribesmen and the personnel of the Eoyal Bavy wil : become embittered. 3. As regards the apprehensions disclosed by Their lordships letter, the Council would further observe (a) That it has been an invariable,principle among all three fighting Services of the Crown that when force has to be employed to achieve the objects of H.M. Government the degree oe force recommended is the minimum considered likely to achieve the end in view. This principle has been, and will be applied no less rigidly by the Koyal Air *’eroe than by the other Services. (b) Air operations against the habitations of tribesmen not in open war against H.M. Goverment have never been undertaken and never will be undertaken, except after all possible action has been taken to reduce loss of life to a minimum. ‘ It has been* and will continue to be, the invariable practice for tribes to be warned that a village is liable to bo bombed and should be avacuated. Moreover, the demonstration suggested in the Admiralty letter is, as the Secretary of State for India will know, the invariable preliminary to air operations of the nature proposed and may, as has frequently occurred, render them unnecessary. (c) A he view apparently held by the Lords dommi sol oners of the Admiralty that the bombing of Jialan Fort will adversely affect the relations between Government and the tribes elsewhere in the Persian Gulf area, especially in regard to the Arabian air route, seems to the Council to be entirely unsupported by any evidence. Experience on the Borth West Frontier of India, in Iraq, and in Aden leads to a precisely opposite conclusion, namely, that the discriminating use of aircraft against one tribe or seoti n leads to an improveo.ent in the relations between Government and other tribes or sections in the same area. Indeed it appears obvious to the Council that if one &gt; recalcitrant ruler finds that by retiring inland out of^ reach of naval bombardment he can be defiant with impunity, ethers will be quick to appreciate our weakness and to take advantage of it by raising all poi-sible difficulties and objections against every proposal for the implementing of . British policy in the i-ersian Gulf. In fact, it is due to • 2 the recalcitrant nature of the tribes beyond the reach &gt; of naval bombardment that our negotiations for the est b- lishment of the alternative civil air route to India have been so prolonged. (d) The Admiralty proposal that naval action should be under- taken alone in the first instance is to repeat the stalemate which occurred in 1928 under almost similar circumstances* On this occasion the fort was destroyed and the sloop retired, whereupon, in the words of the Resident in his confidential despatch Bo. 688-3Mated the 28th December, 1929, after its departure, the Beni Bu All had resumed their occupation of the customs house and re-hoisted the flag. 'ill© present proooaal by the ziesident* irersian Gulf (in which the Air Officer Commanding and the Senior haval Officer have both concurred), has doubtless been put forward in the light of this experience; inde d in his confidential despatch Bo* 137-S dated the 28th Llaroh, 1930, to the Govornment of India, the Resident states in regard to these provosed operations at Sur that 'I agree that action by warship alone wa&amp;d be entirely ineffective; past history has shewn this'* 4. The Council are, therefore, unable to agree that the apprehensions expressed by Their lordships have any sufficient justification* out under the nozraal safeguard?' that have been in force for ten years, will not only give the best chance of achieving their object quickly and humanely but will also result in a closer understanding between the Services as to the nature of each others work and the benefits of co-operation.

My Lords have given careful consideration to the action proposed by the political Resident in his express letter of the 18th December last. While concurring in the action which it is proposed should be taken by one of H.M. Ships, My Lords are seriously \ concerned as to the repercussions on our relations with ! the Arab Rulers generally, and particularly the relations between them and H.M. Ships on the station, of the K proposed bombing by aircraft of Jaalah fort. Aircraft have not previously been used against these Rulers, our policy having been to inflict the minimum punishment necessary to produce compliance with our demands and to take every precaution to avoid loss of human life* Such The Under-Secretary of State INDIA SEN ■/BY AIR MAI of EWB.

My Lords have no information as to the precise position of Ja&amp;lah fort but They would, point out that unless it is well clear of other buildings and of dwellings, it will probably be impossible to adhere to the previous policy of measured punishment and avoidance of loss of life. in this connection My Lords would call attention to the decision of H.M. Government in April 193c, in respect of punitive action against the sheikh of against the loss of human life. My Lords presume that consideration has been given to the repercussions from the proposed bombing by aircraft which may follow in connection with the proposed Arabian Air route.

The Political Resident promised to forward his detailed recommendation for the action to be taken against Shaikh Ali in the event of his non- compliance. Prom the Resident’s telegram of 27th December P.Z. 7971/31 it appears that Shaikh Ali does S not intend to comply and Colonel Biscoe has since produced his detailed plan (in a letter dated 18th December P.Z. 108/32). His proposals are (1) That the new Sultan and Political Agent should proceed in a warship to Aiqa in the middle of February; (2) If Shaikh Ali has left Aiqa the Muscat % State should place a Customs post there and the Shaikh should be informed that any act of aggression against it will be punished. If such aggression occurred Aiqa Fort would be demolished from the sea, and Jail an Port, the Shaikh’s Headquarters, would be bombed by aircraft} (3) If on the other hand Shaikh Ali is still at Aiqa with a large body of followers he should be given an ultimatum to evacuate within 24 hours 415b 3000 10 31 aildand, if not, the demolition of Aiqa Port and bombing of Jadan should take place as in (2) above. There has since been an exchange of • ♦ telegrams between theGovernment of India and the Resident. The former approved of the scheme in general but asked whether theResident proposes to protect the Customs post when established with a detachment of levies. They suggested that more permanent results might be secured if a sufficient fore were maintained at the Customs post to ensure that it would not be retaken by the Shaikh. The Resident, however, gave the following reasons against attempting any organised land protection of the post: (1) In any case such a guard could easily be overpowered by the Beni Bu Ali if they attacked it ♦ * in force; (2) If the post is threatened at any time it would be best defended by counter measures against the Shaikh and not by the defence of the post itself; (3) The Beni Bu Hassan, the neighbours of the Beni Bu Ali, have a permanent feud with •them and would be almost certain to side with the Muscat authorities against the Shaikh. Colonel Biscoe thinks that when the Shaikh sees that we mean business he may accept the situation since the loss of Aiqa does not actually affect him very much. If, on the other hand • he affords us i t i grounds for drastic measures against him either now i or later, the combined effect of punitive action as proposed and a probable attack from the Beni Bu Hassan will be likely to have a permanent deterrent effect.Minute Paper.

Sir I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department Ho. 3178-3^ dated the 18th Decem ber 1 931, and to state that on the material so far available the Govern ment of India are inclined to doubt whether the procedure adopted in the earlier phases of this attempt to restore the authority of the Muscat State in Aiqa was not calculated to lead to a situation of some embarrassment. In particular the wisdom of the Political Agent's action in accompanying Saiyid Said to Aiqa on board one of His Majesty's ships without having consulted superior authority regarding the action to be taken should the Bani Bu All not prove amenable to reason appears to be questionable. The Government of India are also inclined to the opinion that the course of action suggested to the Council of Ministers i.e. the interception of Aiqa dhows by the Muscatt H6 Muscat launch and levies is perhaps hardly consistent with the policy and practice of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf, particularly if such action were to be taken on the high seas* 2« The Government of India will be glad to receive any comments which you may have to offer in the light of these remarks on the incidents mentioned* SL I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Captain Alban haa explained to me that reporte had reached Ouacat to the effect that the Jennebeh were instigating the Bani Bu All at Aiqa to refuse to pay customs duty. The Jennebeh themaalvea had been compelled to submit, but naturally would have preferred to revert to their former independence. If the Bani Bu All succeeded in defying the Muscat Stats then t.c ^etuiti^eh would follow suit. If on the other hand the Ban! Bu Ali ware compelled to submit or ware punished for their c *nt u/.idc,v Jennebeh would be no worse off than they are at present. •.present. It was therefore considered desirable. In order to arold the risk of aqy farther trouble with the Jermebeh and to strengthen the position of the &amp;tate at aur # to interview the people of Alqa and to try and effect a settlement with them. 3* it will be seen that at first they assumed a conciliatory attitude, but the following day appeared to have changed their mind* As Captain Alban points cut, the inhabitants of Aiqa who are not, 1 think, particularly a warlike or militant people, are between the devil and the deep sea. On the one hand they are afraid of their own uhaikh, and on the other are loth themselves to resist the Muscat State. 4. The rest of ths despatch does not, I think, call for further explanation or comments, but there is one point in the letter froa the President of the Council of the 30th October to the Political Agent, regarding which I have questioned Captain Alban. the President of the Council writes in the th*rd paragraph ' In ay previous letters 1 requested assistance from nie £*4 ©sty* s Government, but I have not so far been favoured with a reply**. ^ajor Fowls, when acting as Political Hesident, ini orraed the Political Agent that under no circumstances could a alo *p give more than moral support, and Captain Alban tolls me that he took this telegram over to Saiyld Said, and read it to him. saiyld 3aid*s statement therefore is not strictly accurate. The rmttex* is not of much practical importance, but X thought it better to clear it up in case it might be thought that salyid -aid had been left in doubt as to whether at that time m*s • Government were prepared te authorlae a aloop to eupport him or not.

G. Alban, I.A., Political Agent 8c Consul, Muscat• The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire. © 223 ) In continuation of my telegrams Nos.245 and 246, dated the 28th October, and No.254, dated the 31st October 1931, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of a letter and enclosures dated October 30th, 1931, from the President, Council of Ministers, to me. 2. The letter deals with the recent unexpected visit to Sur paid by Saiyid Said the President of the Council accompanied by myself. 3. Sur was visited by us on October 26th on H.M.S. 'Penzance', we landed at the old Customs house at Umm Qarimitain, and, after being welcomed by those representative Shaikhs who were present in Shr, we proceeded to the house of Nasir bin Mohamed, Chief of the Aramah Section. 4. This was the President’s third visit to Sur and as the completion of Sur control was now being held up by the residents of Aiqa not being subjected to payment of Customs dues I advised Saiyid Said to send for these people and thrash the matter out with them. 5. On the evening of the 26th October therefore, the Bani Bu AliBail Bu All of Aiqa presented themselves before Saiyid Said, and, as I was afterwards informed by him, were very reason- able, they said that they had no objection to paying Customs or to registering their boats and that they had not previously been asked to do these things* At the conclusion of the meeting they promised to return next morning and resume the discussion* 6* Haturally, we wereall very pleased at what seemed such an eminently proper and right frame of mind on the part of the Ban! Bu Ali* 7* On the next morning, October 27th, Saiyid Said asked me to be present at the resumption of the meeting* 8* Accordingly, I accompanied Saiyid Said to the meeting room, into which, after a few minutes, was ushered the dirtiest collection of scallywags X have ever seen* Only one man was decently dressed, and, after the assembly had shaken hands and sat down, Saiyid Said addressed him saying that these appeared to be a mere collection of were Askaris and where/the representatives of Aiqa who had been present the evening before and had promised to c ome again in the morning? The man who was one of the influential people of Aiqa replied in a very insolent manner, that they were all in Aiqa and did not propose to come* 9* Saiyid Said accordingly, and after consulting me, ordered them to leave the room and to send for the others at once* 10* After waiting more than an hour and a half without result, I suggested that the Wali as representative of the Government might be sent to bring them. The Wali accordingly departed accompanied by fifteen or twenty of his Askaris* 11* After another wait of an hour, Saiyid Said and I left to look • • • *look at the new Customs building on the Khor* There we waited for another hour at the end of which the *¥ali with his Askaris returned empty handed with the explanation that he had induced all the leading men to come as far as theedge of the Xhor when they had suddently taken to their heels and scattered into the houses. 12. Saiyid Said accordingly wrote the attached letter to the Bani Bu Ali of Aiqa and shortly after we embarked again for Muscat• 13. As we were pushing off the reply, attached&gt; reached us. 14. The position is, that now as always, this spot Aiqa remains a blot and a stumbling block to the otherwise easy task of establishing a sound administration at 3ur. 15. The present incident constitutes a test case. The Bani Bu Ali have hinted more than once that the British Government is not really backing the State in its claim that Aiqa must conform to the laws offthe State and pay Customs and all other dues without dietinction f rom other subjects of Muscat. The Jennebeh, having already submitted, are now watching with interest the result of this public defiance by the Bani Bu Ali of Aiqa. 16. The people of Aiqa are in the difficult position of trying to serve two masters*' if they agree to the demands of the State, then the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali in Jaalan will vent his dis pleasure oh them , 1 tf they obey his orders then they incur the displeasure of the State. 3 ^ 7 # in order to make this point clear I advised Jaiyid Said to put them to the test and, they have decided that the dis pleasure of their Shaikh, many miles away, is more to be feared than that of the State. 18. In these days of financial depression, Sur trade is do.ng well and by tightening up control there and preventing Customs leakage • e •leakage a great step will have been taken towards counter balancing an inevitable drop in revenues in other parts of the State* ‘ If the residents of Aiqa wish to persist in their foolish evasion of the law they will only be able to do so by infciating some aggression upon the State* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd/- R.G*Alban, Captain, Political Agent &amp; H^B.M.’s Consul*Confidential Translation of a letter dated 17th Jamedi al Thani 1350 (30th October 1931) from Saiyid Said bin Tairaur, President, Council Ministers, Muscat State, Muscat, to Captain R* G*Alban,I.A. ,H*B # M.*s Consul, Muscat. After Compliments, on 26th October 1931 and reached there the same evening. I do not wish to write a long narrative of the incidents as you were present and witnessed all what happened. You advised me to call the people of Aiqa at Hillat Omm ^armitain where I could talk to them about the taxes and the registration of their boats. I accordingly ordered the people of i Aiqa to call on me butthey refused to do so. I then sent the Wali for them but they absolutely refused to come as you are aware. On the return of the Wali I addressed a letter to them as per attached copy. They sent a reply which indicates their refusal, a copy of which is herewith enclosed. I must say that these subjects of Aiqa should be punished for their insolence. In my previous letters I requested assistance from H.B.M.’s Government, but I have so far not been favoured with a reply. I am sure that you are now convinced that these subjects will never obey our Governments orders if no force is used and if they are not punished the situation will be worse and rather encourage other subjects to rebel. The people of Sur are all now awaiting the result of this incident• I request K.B.M.’s Government to extend their assistance as in the past; their favours are never forgotten and we are certain that they desire nothing but the welfare of bhr State. I have not gone into long details; in this matter I have been guided by your advice, and I should therefore feel highly obliged if As you are aware we both proceeded you . • *you would kindly refer this matter to the Hon’ble the Political Resident forwarding at the same time our letter and asking for a reply. Whatever he thinks fit in tills important matter we are ready to do as we know that his suggestions and advice will be to the interest of the State of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. According to theinstractions of the Hon'ble the Political Resident and your advice that we should at present send our boat the 'Al Said” to capture dhows of the Bani Bu Ali of Aiqa and that we should make use of our levy at Bait al Falaj, the boat will be leaving tonight with Oaiyid Ualik bin Faisal and a Jemadar in charge of 15 men of the levy. They have been instructed to capture and bring to Muscat boats belonging to the people of Aiqa. We therefore request the assistance from H.B.M^s Government so tit t the result of our action may be satisfactory.7842 Copy of a letter dated 14th Jamadi al TJiank 1350 , « -try » (27-10-31) from Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Pr^ideht.of the Council of Ministers* Muscat State* Muscat* to£11 the chiefs of Aiqa*Aiqa* • •see I instructed you t o call on me at Hillat Umm qarmitain this morning but you did not come* I sent to you the Wall* Saif bin Bedr* but you also did not accompany him.

Effective customs control has been established over the town of Sur itself 9 and the authority of the Gtat* extended over the four sections of the Jennebeh who inhabit It. Ae a result the customs revenue has gone up very materially, and a new customs house has besn built iJtmrm oOsmund inn the creek. For ... |i’or theoe reeulta laljrid Said 1 think &lt;ifiacrTett &lt;uch credit* Oil «a©h oocasi n he travelled in one of His ^sjesty*• ships# kindly placed at his disposal ly the senior &amp;&amp;T &amp;1 Officer# which certainly facilitated his task and enhanced his prestige and credit ie also due to Captain i Ibas# under whose guidance he acted* 4» On the furth r side of the e eek# however# at $ur# is the sostil village of Aiqa# inhabited by the ft&amp;ai Bu All# tdieee Shaikh, /li bin Abdullah# resides in the interior at Jaal(«n« Thie tribe has for some years pact adopted a most rebellious attitude towards the Muscat htate and even went eo far as to fly their own flag at Aiqa* This was finally stopped on ray vieit to Sur in August 1930 when 1 personally ordered the Shaikh to haul down his flag* 3* Since then the attitude of the ani Bu All has greatly improved, they flew the Muscat flag on one or two occ^si ns when deiyid Said visited the plaee# and seemed generally disposed to adopt a less contumacious attitude* Customs control# however# was not definitely eetablieiied# and the matter was complicated by the fact that as a reward for previous services ren ered to the State the shaikh of the Ban! Bu All was entitled to import geode for hie personal use free of duty • a some*bat elastic term Which Is capable of various interprstati ons* 6 * After i&amp;iyid daid* s first visit to dor# Shaikh All# possibly having seen how ths awry of the State hr o been effectively extended over the Jennebeh# appears to have considered it desirable to come to terms with the Muscat State# and he therefore wrote to Saiyid iaid saying that he desired to discuss various matters with him* Selyid Said therefore proceeded to Alqa again and a meeting took place at which • * •( 261 ) which the Shaikh of the iani Bu Alt claimed mi allowaiioe of 500 oollare a month, and agreed that a cuetoma house should oe estahlished at iqs, but contended Vnmt no taxes should.be levied on the iaisa bit ants of the village itself, and he added that he could not be responsible for hie followers if they were made to pay customs. Saiyid said not unnaturally rejected tfaes terms but postponed definite action in thie connection to a later date. 7 . /«t the end of September the Council of Ministers addressed a letter to the i olitical A§ent expressing the view tifet it was neoeosaxy to establish c stoma control over /iqa and that Saiyid Said wished to proceed there with this object in view, and intended to take with him 90 men of the levies and proceed in the •Al Said**. They further stated that Saiyld Said proposed, after having arrived at Aiqa and established s customs post there, to inform Shaikh All that while cue tome duty would in future be levied at /iqe, certain articles for his own personal uss would, as previously, be free. the Council of Ministers asked that one of His Majesty 1 ships should be present at Hur while the above arrange uents we- e »«^J being carried out, both ae a threat to the Ban! Bu All and as a su port in case of maer^cncy. Subsequently, ae H.M. ». 'Pensance' was visiting .lur on the 23rd October, oaiyid oaid asked If he could be given a paeeege in her and wae infomed in reply that there was no objection. He had already been previously informed that under no ciroumetancee eould a eloop give any active assistance, and Saiyid da id wae therefore well aware that he could only count on the moral support which a passage in His Majesty’s ship gave him. 8 . ..bile 2 have not yet received details of what «xr ctly took place at dur, it seems clear that the Ban!

They refused to interriew Bely id iaid and Captain /.Iban, vrtio wae also there 9 ana defied the vali who went in per® anally to induoe the leading; soon to cocae ixu The Political A^ent asked that draetie measures should toe taken toy His Majesty 1 s ships as punishment for this aotion, and rsoois&amp;endsd that .&lt;iqa dhows returning from Baerah should toe searched for and 8 elaed« X did not support this proposal for the foil owing reasonei firstly, I felt that every effort hau not toeen made to el feet a eettleiftent toy means oi v peaceful and friendly \\ dieoueeionei seeondly, X felt thfit His Majesty*s aovernnent and ths I last resort when definite aggression had been committed, or to protsot Ilfs and property* X therefore telegraphed to ths intercept the &amp;iq&amp; dhows with their own Btate launch and s few levies. These dhows would presumably pass close outside Muscat end the Muscat authorities are of course entirely within their ritfit* in taking aotion of this nature against their subjects. Op to ths present however I have not received intimation whether any dhows have toeen seized, and the measure therefore has presum ably toeen unsuccessful. if no control is offeotsd over the 3ani But hli residing at Aiqa it will obviously have s very bad offset on the Jennetoeh at u-ur and in a short time ths good work that Saiyid Said has accomplished will to a large extent toe undone. The prestige of the State would eufi er and the political effect would toe toad, 10 , secondly, the financial condition of the State, ae the Ocwernment of India are aware, etill ocoasione a good deal of Political Agent, suggesting that the Couneil should try and 9, Xf so X do not think that maitere can be allowed to reet where they are now.

If the itani Bu 411 still remain entirely loftranalgeant then I think there is nothing for it but for the Muscat State to take forcible measures rg Inst them# and in such elreumetanoes they can I think legitimately ask for the support of His Majesty's devernment# having regard to their own very limited resources* / fhe • • • .

The first, which the majority of the papers deal with, was the rebellious attitude of members of the Beni Bu Ali tribe, led by Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah al Hamudah. The papers, which concern efforts by the British to assist the Muscat authorities in bringing the tribe to order, cover the following matters:the proposal and consequences of a visit to Sur by the President of the Council of Ministers, Sayyid Said bin Taimur Al Bu Said [Sa‘īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd], and the Political Agent, Captain Reginald George Evelyn William Alban, to negotiate with Shaikh Ali in October 1931the effort to establish a customs post at Aiqathe question of the appropriate use of forcearrangements for further visits in December 1931the seizure of dhows belonging to the Beni Bu Ali tribethe Government of India's disapproval of the Political Agent's conductletters of congratulations and thanks following the peaceful resolution of the crisisthe question of when to restore Shaikh Ali's privileges.The second incident covered by the file is the murder of a British Indian man by a member of the Shihuh tribe in June 1936. The correspondence discusses the action that should be taken.The principal correspondents are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Political Agent at Muscat, Government of India (Foreign and Political Department), Foreign Office, Admiralty, Air Ministry, Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, Commander-in-Chief in the East Indies, India Office, Sultan Said bin Taimur, and Shaikh Ali of the Beni Bu Ali.The file contains several reports, as follows:Report on the visit to Sur of 26 October 1931, by Captain Alban, 31 October 1931 (folios 223-26)Report on the 'Situation at Sur and Aiqa', with notes on the Bani Bu Ali tribe, by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, 20 December 1931 (folios 137-51)Report on the crisis as a whole by Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Vincent Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 19 March 1932 (folios 97-108)Report on 'Operations at Sur, 4th-9th March 1932' by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, 19 March 1932 (folios 85-87)Report on the situation at Sur a year after the crisis by Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 4 March 1933 (folios 74-76).A sketch map of the area around Sur can be found on folio 193.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Banī Bū 'Alī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sur</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001f4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
