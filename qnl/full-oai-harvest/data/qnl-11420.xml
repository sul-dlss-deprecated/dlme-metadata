It consists of two main parts. The first part deals with the premises for British policy, namely, the proclamation issued on British arrival in Baghdad, that they had come to emancipate the country from the 'oppressive rule' of Turkey; the announcement of policy in the telegram, 29 March 1917, from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy which advocated annexation of the Basrah [Basra] Vilayet and the creation of a 'veiled protectorate' in Baghdad Vilayet.It discusses the 'difficulties' this would create with President Woodrow Wilson's principles of self-determination (paragraph 4) and the issues surrounding the creation of an 'Arab facade'.Part II deals with observations on more detailed issues and considers: the nature of Arab authority, dynastic or representative and Arab attitudes to King Hussein, Sherif of the Holy Places in the Hejaz [Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī, Shereef of Mecca]; personnel available for establishing a local administration; relevance of Indian models of administration and British supervision; requirements for Indian troops after the end of hostilities; ways of popularising British administration through irrigation, education and civilian health; elements the British should foster; measures to consolidate commercial influence in Mesopotamia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Basra</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ottoman Empire</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002ae#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
