Some concession vide paragraph 2 of Jedaa telegram Ho. 174 of December 27th, 1939, might solve the difficulty, hut I do not think that the Shaikh of Kuwait will ever willingly agree to a system of permits for Bedouin. In any case the proviso is too exclusive to meet the needs of Kuwait. The interests of Kuwait, in my opinion, would best be ^ served by the reinsertion of the word musabal a in paragraph 9 of the Bon Voisinage Treaty (entailing amendments in other places) and the Bedouin of Northern Arabia be free to roam at will. (2) Enlistment . I anticipate no difficulty on this score. (3) li st of tribes . There is no one whole tribe residing in Kuwait and the Shaikh can only reasonably claim individuals of certain tribes as his subjects as already stated in paragraph 6 (iii) of Shaikh of Kuwait’s letter Ho. V6-1213 of the 11 th July, 1939. By tribes in Kuwait can be understood two divisions- (Signature) the/ (Designation) MFP—1534 S&amp;P—(M-2835)—24.5-38—10,000.the Hadhar, or settled tribesmen, and the Bedouin proper. It would, I suppose, he possible to list the Hadhar hy those who are in Kuwait territory, hut to do so now during a drought when many tribes have moved southwards would only result in a list detrimental to Kuwait interests. In my opinion, the appendix of a B.Y.Treaty is not where the settlement of the question of the over lordship of the tribes should find place, and the appendix should be omitted. Beyond the above it is impossible to worlc a system of permits for Bedouin unless their nationality has first been settled, and, as the question of nationality and Bin Saud f s suggestion are concomitant fre the reinsertion of musabala in article 9 of the B.Y. Treaty, and exclusion of article 7 of the schedule to the Treaty is the only practical solution. (4) As for jurisdiction, the suggestion meets the case.

In practice, no doubt, Jbn baud finds great difficulty in controlling &amp;edouin on the desert frontier and he wishes the ihelkh to do it for him. At any rate it sc* ms that our best course now would be to try to get both sides to agree to the omission of Article 9 of the Trane Agreement and the words M or musaba.a M in Article 9 of the Bon Vo 1st nag e Agreement and the wnole of Article 11(5) of that /grwsment 2 3. As regards the enlistment of the nationals of on® government in the armed forces of the other, there seems no difficulty about this and we suggest it would be best to omit Article 10 of the Bon Volsinage Agreement altogether. 4.

At the same time the King has made his agent in Kuwait - Ihfici - responsible to see that the lorries sent here to bring Government goods are properly utilised.Telegram Q # From His Majesty 1 s Minister, Jedda.

In the Saudi draft of the Trade Agreement first paragraph of article 9 of the Agreement has not been included but Hafiz has agreed to insertion of wording as proposed for article 11(5) of the Bon Voisinage Treaty.

His Majesty’s Minister, Jeddah. No. C/79. Dated the 28th February, 1940. IMPORTANT. A- 3 1 Brief remarks on my telegram No. C/76 of 28th February are:- (a) Kuwait cannot object to Saudis imposing restrictions on their people and as regards our informing Saudi Agent here of purchases there seems no local objection. Kuwait imposed soon after war broke out regulation that all Bedouin must obtain clearance papers for exports from local authorities so only new departure for Kuwait will be to inform Saudi Agent as regards Saudis. Hafiz could not agree to the total exclusion of the Article. (b) and (d) No remarks. (c) Question of Joint Commission is of course new but Hafiz did not seem to think that Commission would materialise early. In any case Kuwait seem to have nothing to lose by a settlement. It appears that Bin Saud sets great store on list of tribes and without something on the above lines I doubt if we shall be able to come to an agreement. POLITICALTelegram Inter.

I have spoken to His Highness who definitely does not want any fort established at Al Wafra. He thinks that a fort would be the first step to upsetting “k * 16 status quo in the Neutral Zone with the eventual object of opening up the way for oil exploitations. His Highness thinks that the request is only a cloak to hide the real intension. He states that there is water close to the southern boundary of the Neutral Zone in Saudi territory, and that Ibn Saud could establish a fort in that region. He adds that there is no trade route through the Zone though odd camel caravans may pass that way. A number of tribesmen and herdsmen move south by this route. 3* With regard to anti-smug ;ling measure mentioned in India Office telegram No.21?5 of the 6 th May, 1940, I d) not think that a problem really exists. All articles, except a minimum allowance of food per head, which leave here for Saudi Arabia do so on manifests issued by Saudi officials which can as easily be checked on Ibn Baud's side of the Neutral Zone section of the frontier as on his side of the remainder of the frontier.

I have nothing further to add except that case is not I think complicated as envisaged by Foreign Office, for I agree with Shaikh that there is no need for a post at WAFRA. Bin Saud before the agreements had machinery to deal with smuggling which owing to control of exports now in Kuwait is less in demand than before. Zone is inhabited by nomads unaware of the frontiers and of course no goods are consigned or manifests made out for zone and then reconsigned to Saudi Arabia. Kuwait therefore has no interest in a control post in Zone and desires no post, or joint post. 3 # I asked Shaikh about the posts he is to establish under the agreements and he states that so far as he is concerned none is necessary as all is sufficiently controllec in Kuwait and that until the need arises he does not propose to build any. A possible solution to the present situation, provided Bin Saud establishes necessity for a post at all, is that there should be a joint one at WAFRA and the Subaihiya post not established. I have of course said nothing to Shaikh on these lines and I do not think that he would view the situation with favour. POLITICALf CONFIDENTIAL . No * 311-S of 1940.

Of tnoi-r own information, Shaikh’s main objection is his suspicion that Ibn Saud’s real object is to undermine the status quo in the Neutral Zone and force his hand over the Oil negotiations. 3. The Shaikh is very tenacious of his rights in the Neutral Zone and it would be very difficult to convince him that they would not be prejudiced by Saudi proposal. On the other hand apparently UQAIR Protocol is vague and you will see from Mr. Eyres letter of April 29th to India Office that the position is such that in the absence of any mutual agreement, His Majesty’s Government might have to advise the Shaikh to assent to Ibn Saud’s proposal, if, on further consideration, the necessity of the proposal were clearly established and Shaikh’s objections should appear unreasonable and vexatious. 4 # In the circumstances, you should, if you see no objection, inform Ibn Saud that Shaikh for reasons given at (a) and (b) above cannot see the necessity for a post at WAFRA and is opposed to its establishment. With information at their disposal,His Majesty’s Government find it difficult to press him to reconsider his view, especially as no suggestion was made during the lengthy negotiations for trade agreement that any- 2 - control post would be required in the Neutral Zone. You may also explain the difficulties that might arise if Customs posts were established in the Neutral Zone (see e.g. paragraph No .6 of Mr. Eyres f letter) and enquire whether it would not be possible for Ibn Saud to have a post or posts on his own side of the boundary of Neutral Zone, as suggested by Shaikh.

I agree to what you say, which is what we agreed to; and the procedure shall be according to it. . . ’ * I have, etc. (3) To the Saudi Arabian Minister f° r Foreign Affairs from'His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. Your Royal Highness, Your Royal Highness has askea me to confirm to you that the provisions of the Extradition Agreement between the Government of .Saudi Arabia, of the one part, and the Government of the United Kingdom, acting on behalf of the Sheikh, of Koweit, of ihe other part, which has 'been cone luded^this day, and particularly the provisions of rticle o (2) thereof, shall apply even though the person conmiit'ting/committing an offence for which extradition is demanded is a Badu. I accordingly write to assure Your Royal Highness that it is the intention of the Govern-* ment of the United Kingdom and the Government of Koweit that the provisions of the said Agreement and particularly of Article 3 (2) thereof, shall apply equally whether the person committing an offence for which extradition is demanded is a Badu or not. (4) To His Majesty's Minister at Jedda from the Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Monsieur le Ministre, I have received your note of today’s date and take note of your assurance that it is the intention of the Government of the United Kingdom and of the Government of Koweit that the provisions of the Extradition Agreement concluded this day. and particularly the provisions of Article 3 (2) thereof, shall apply equally whether the person committing an offence for which extradition is demanded is a Badu or not. On behalf of the Government of Saudi Arabia I hereby assure you that it is the intention of the Government of Saudi Arabia also to interpret the Agreement in this way.?opy. (S 1504/227/25), I have discussed the two new notes with Mr, Ba^allav anr* understand that so far as can he Judged the intention ^f the + 13 t0 se P arate th e Question of the tribes from the Schedule to the Bon Voisinage Agreement, and that the general purpose of the notes is to decide which tribes or sections of tribes are dependent upon Saudi Arabia and uuon Koweit respectively. The first thing that strikes one about the notes therefore is that there is no list of Koweit tribes. Secondly the notes speak of determining the nationality of elements (i.e. presumably tribal groups or sections) when really something like ”tribal dependence’' is meant, our conception of nationality being something which affects the individual, third point is that it is not clear whether the arrangements to settle this Question are to be made direct between Saudi Arabia and Koweit or through His Majesty's Government, I have made tentative amendments in both notes to meet the first two points, and as regards the third I have inserted provisionally the Saudi and Koweiti Governments. One further point occurs to one in connexion with the Bon Voisinage Agreement and Schedule. There is not so far as I can see anything in the Agreement to link it with the Schedule, although it seems perfectly clear that the latter is intended to serve as a guide to the Frontier Officers in carrying out their duties under the Agreement. I find some difficulty in selecting a suitable place for inserting the necessary link, but it would suffice for the purpose if, in Article 3 (l) of the Agreement, after the words 'application of the provisions 'of this Agreement'the words 'in accordance with the annexed ’Schedule' were inserted. serve a casual reference in Article 11 (4).© IB?

As you know, he is very tenacious of those rights, even to the extent of sacrificing the prospects of additional revenue from oil companies rather than agree to negotiate the grant of a concession over his share in the Zone. From the practical point of view, the Political Agent has ^ expressed the opinion that the problem of anti-smuggling measures in the Neutral Zone does not really exist. In the circumstances we hope that you will be able to ask the Minister to inform Ibn Saud that for the reasons given in (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of Prior's telegram the Sheikh is definitely opposed to the proposal and that His Majesty's Government, in the absence of fuller demonstration of the practical necessity for a post at Wafra, do not feel able to ask the Sheikh to reconsider the matter.

Dated 1st received 2nd December 1940 CONFI DENTIAL Kuwait Receipt Ne nn'L Bated I nave nad long i i r aDin regarding modification of drafts of Kuwait agreements, 1 • Trade Agreement, (a) King wishes agreement to he for 5 years, j told Yusuf Yasin that I must refer this point. (h) Exchange of letters between Hafiz Tahaha and x olitical Agent, Kuwait., provided for insertion after the , x, ^ • rr words 'for Musabala' in Article 9 of the words 'or for any othepurpose not specified in this Article', i have agreed subject to your observations to insert them. Bon Voisinage Agreement. ✓ (a) Yusuf Yasin considers reference to schedule couxd more suitably be made in Article 3(ii) by inserting words 'and schedule annexed thereto' after the word 'agreement'. He feels I think justifiably that insertion r &gt; of words in Article 3(i) modifies sense of Article, I have agreed subject to your approval. -h ‘i k , (b) Article 6(ii). Arabic version of second sentence agreed upon, Yusuf Yasin stated, between Hafiz Tahaba and Major Galloway read: 'If they are not nationals of country which they A entered'. I could not agree to this but suggested insertion of words 'or of a third Arabia? State' after word 'country' thus bringing Article into line with Article 1 of Extradition Agreement. After prolonged argument Yusuf Yasin agreed. Do you agree ? (c) Notes regarding tribal allegiance. Yusuf Yasin pressed strongly for wording agreed upon between Hafiz ‘Tahaba and Political Agent. Ibn Saud would never accept wording of re-draft. Intention was not, as treaty Department thought (please see Department’s note /accompanyingaccompanying draft), to decide which tribes or sections are dependent upon 3audi Arabia or Kuwait respectively. There are no Kuwait tribes. All tribes are Nejdi hut elements of these tribes known collectively as Araibdar are settled in Kuwait and ibn 3aud is prepared to recognise their allegiance to Shaikh of Kuwait. Shairh and Political igent for him recognised position and agreement was reached on that basis. I appreciate King’s point of view but said that I must refer question. Meanwhile Yusuf Yasin agreed to insertion 01 word 'Araibdar H under heading tribes of Kuwait in accordance with political Agent’s suggestion to me. I trust in view of ibn Saud’s strong feelings original draft may be accepted. 3• Extradition Agreement. Yusuf Yasin accepted stamping and sealing of document but held out very strongly for retention of original draft of second exchange of letters agreed upon by Hafiz Hahaba and Major Galloway. Discussions on this point are continuing and I will telegraph result. 4. Language. I told Yusuf Yasin that you insisted on an English text for publication as a White Paper. He countered by citing Bahra Agreement where, translation was published as a white paper, Tbn Saud hoped His Majesty’s Government would agree to Arabic text alone being signed (gr. mut) (gr. mut) and that there should be two texts, the Arabic prevailing in case of dispute. He made point made in paragraph 17 of Sir Gilbert Clayton’s report of 25th November 1925 (Middle East No. 7 Eebruary 7th 1926) that agreement will be implemented by two Arabic speaking states. T promised to lay his views before you in the hope that one or other of his suggestions would be /acceptable.acceptable.

My comments are: 1 (a) Prom this it can be surmized that Bin Saul is satisfied with the Agreement as seen after it has been six months in force. Kuwait is also satisfied, therefore, there appears to be no objection to increasing the period to five years. I have not approached Shaikh who will agree with what we suggest, particularly if our suggestion coincides with Bin Sand’s views. (b) Addition of 'or of any other purpose not specified in the article' is necessary to safeguard the free movement of herdsmen. 2 (a) Yusuf Yasin’s views seem to be correct.terms of extradition agreement would come into play 'before the surrendering of individuals. Minister^ correction is an added precaution to which I think: we can agree. (c) I doubt if the term ' Araibdar * could be held to include all the Hashayida, the whole of which tribe the Shaikh claims. It is clear that Bin Baud would never agree to the Bashayida being cut from his list, and inserted under Kuwait, and as there is no doubt that the whole tribe is not subject to Kuwait, but only elements as is the case with the Ajman etc. the insertion of the term ' Araibdar * under 'Tribes of Kuwait' will fully safeguard the Shaikh’s interests. It is recognised | here that no tribes are in origin Kuwaiti, but it is possible that all are not even Nejdi, therefore the note should be worded as settled previously, i.e. to decide which elements are Kuwaiti and not, as Yusuf Yasin points out, to decide also which are Nejdi. The omission of the words 'or Saudi Arabia respectively' 3 in the 'Foreign Office drafts should bring the note into line with Bin Saul’s and the Shaikh’s views and also meet the needs of correct diplomatic language. 3 . Foreign Office have excluded the letter which provided for negotiations concerning the extradition of foreigners other | than Arab foreigners. His Majesty's Government agreed to hold the matter over for discussion at a later date. Some form oj. note is therefore necessary to cover the point. 4. If it is finally agreed that the Arabic text should prevail I hope we shall be given an opportunity to see a final Arabic draft before the signature copies are prepared.

Bon voisinage Agreement. No objection to (a) or (b). (c)Saudi point of view probably best be met by ommission of words 'or Saudi Arabia respectively' in last paragraph. 3. Extradition Agreement. Our re-draft exchange of letters was drawn on assumption that it was intended to provide that bedouin could be extradited for crimes of violence in the same way as anybody else. It appears however to be baudi intention( ?) to say bedouins only commit crimes of violence and therefore all bedouins who commit crimes can be extradited. If this is meaning of letters they seriously undermine value of article 3 where crimes for which extradition can be granted are enumerated. If tit is true bedouin only commit crimes of violence letters appear to be unnecessary. Similar letters were attached to Saudi Iraqi agreement of 1931 but that was anagreement between two Arabic countries /with2. with which we had no concern, it will not be possible to put draft exchange of notes in their original form in agreement to which His Majesty T s Government is a party. We hope Saudi Arabian Government will agree to ommission of tnem altogether. 4. Language. English text.

After Compliments, r luJ Your letter No.437, dated the 6th December, 1941, was received with pleasure and the contents were fully- understood. I would like to inform Your Excellency that I have already explained in my previous letters, my point of view concerning the question of the tribes and the limiting of their identity. This is a very hard problem, as most of these tribes are nearly alike in everything. I have also confirmed several times that there is no difference between His Majesty King Ibn Saud and ourselves. t it Regarding what you pointed out, referring to the previous Political Agent’s letter NcfTihQ/C/B?, dated the 4th March, 1940, what we understood from that letter was, the question of camping of the tribes i.e. their dwelling places, and not the identity of their allegiance as we rely upon, the origin letter in the Agency, written in Arabic, and we beleive it is a true copy of the English document. Your Excellency know that there is nothing to be called Kuwaiti or Nejdi element especially when the tribes are concerned, as they are all descending from the same famous Arab families and clans like Mutair, Ajman and El-Rasahaida etc. Let Your Excellency be sure that we have no any other trouble beside what we stated above and I shall be very grateful to discuss this matter with Your Excellency. Usual Ending. I v fTelegram S From No To Political Agent, Kuwait. Political Resident, Bushiee 0/674 Dated the 15th December, 1941. A* • Your telegram T/635 November 6th. Kuwait - Saudi Agreements. 2. Shaikh has agreed to l (b), 2(a) (b) and 3 but not to 2 (c). Shaikh has strongly pressed for the exclusion of the letters concerning tribal allegiance prefering to leave the question open. 3. These letters could not be acceptable to the Shaikh in their present form. They show no tribes under the heading 'Tribes of Kuwait' and thus the last paragraph of the second letter implies that we on the Shaikh’s behalf agree# that there are none. This is not true for we know that the Shaikh claims the major portion of the Rashiyada and elements in other tribes. In the event of the Committee as visualised being appointed no provision has been made for arbitration when a deadlock occurs as occur it will. An arbitrator there must be and one whose decision will not only be final but will be acceptable to both parties. 4. I consider that no useful purpose can be served by retaining this exchange of letters and that they are in fact a potential source of friction between the two countries. I suggest that such pressure as may be possible be exerted to induce the Saudi Government to agree to the exclusion of the letters. Should tribal trouble occur later then the question can be reopened and an equitable solution sought. - Political -A 'A ?Oxp; Telegram - s L^ 41 1 *fygaiS ' r .,,~ •’— ^ rom “ Politi ca il^^i^Slltv-l^iushire.

Paragraph 3. Shaikh had not seen redrafted letters which formed an enclosure to Foreign Office letter No. 734/227/25 of May 16th, 1940, until shown them by me last month. He then objected to determination of tribal allegiance by Joint Committee pointing out that he had only agreed to settlement of question of tribal dwelling places. You will note that Arabic text of Paragraph 1 of my predecessor’s letter No. 159 of March 4th, 1940, is not a correct translation of the English version. The word rt settlenient' has been taken to mean 'dwelling place' by the translator and not the reconciliation of differences regarding nationality. Shaikh points out, correctly, that Bedouin allegiance is largely influenced by fear and money and that Ibn Saud is stronger and richer than he is so will f) U ' [ have the advantage. ' 'Araibdar' should suffice provided it means in Saudi circles what it does in Kuwait. I will again discuss both these points with him. 4. Paragraph 4.

He did, however, add that when in conversation with Ibn Saud they both naturally referred to each other as brothers and to their people (and presumably armed iorces; as one: as you know, such talk is only what is to be expected at reunions of this nature.

He insists that it is impossible for nomads to obtain documents every time they wish to enter Koweit to make purchases. (R ends) He repeats offer to guarantee to exercise a personal check on all purchases made by Bedouins. Bo you seejany prospect of per suading Ibn Baud to drop his proposal on this basis? 2.

Sheikh also objects to the list of Saudi tribes in Article 7 of the schedule to Bon Voisinage Agreement. He claims that certain elements of these tribes are his subjects, ihis article seems out of place in such an agreement and could very well be omitted. 4. His Majesty’s Government for their part wish to omit the words 'or of a third state' from Article 1 etc., of the Sxtraditi on/- 2 - Extradition Agreement. Sheikh does not exercise jurisdiction over the nationals of all third states and it would he impossible for him to undertake to extradite persons over whom he has no jurisdiction. 5.

About Musabala, King recognises that in rare cases Bedouins might have difficulty in obtaining permits. He thought that he could agree to the Sheikh issuing permits, giving copy to the Saudi-Arabian Agent at Kuwait, provided it were made clear that such cases would be rare. 3. About enlistment, King had no objection to Sheikh’s ? suggestion both Governments could employ nationals other than in their armed forces. 4. About list of tribes, King suggested that any such, living in Kuwait, who wished to remain Kuwaitis should be listed by a joint Commission. 5. About the Sheikh’s lack of jurisdiction over nationals of certain third states, King asked whether there would be an agreement with His Majesty’s Government to cover such cases. 6 . Concerning Musabala and enlistment, I suggest that drafts on the above-mentioned lines might be prepared in Kuwait, and telegraphed here for submission to King when he visits Hejaz about the middle of January.As for a tribal list of it, de Gaury suggests that the Sheikh should forestall King r s proposal by making a list of those Bedouins who are by common consent Kuwaitis: It would comparatively shorten and would not leave much room for argument on either side. As for the last point, in view of ^ \u^ ( l ) Mr. Baggallay's letter of' May 4th paragraph (3) (clear) the answer is no, but the insertion of 'Arab' between 'third' and 'state' might satisfy ? mut: . 7.

(a) iiusabala. in view of great difficulty which tnis has caused, tha Foreign Office suggest as possible solution that til reference to it should be omitted on the ground that it is already open tc the Shaikh , apart fi'om agreement, to the letting of tribesmen from Saudi territory to enter Kuwait for whatever purpose without obtaining his permission, while on the s&amp;udi side it is similarly open to Ibn Saud to lay down that his tribesmen must not leave Saudi territory without a document issued by Saudi authorities. This solution would involve omission of:- (i) . . rticle 9 of Trade -agreement (ii) . the words 'or Musabala' of Bon voisinag© agreement, and (iii) . , rticle il (5) of that agreement. Please consider this suggestion which would presumably be acceptable at any rate to the shaikh. (b) Enlistment. This seems to offer no difficulty. Foreign Office suggest that it would be best to omit Article 10 of on voisinage agreement entirely. (c) List of tribes. Suggestion that shaikh might mcme list of tribes claimed s his subjects (paragraph No .6 of Jedda telegram) might be adopted. 1 fiU) Jurisdiction.

Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 158 of the 1st November, regarding the proposed Saudi-Koweit Agreements respecting Trade, Friendly Relations and Bon Voisinage, and Extradition, I transmit to you herewith a copy of an express letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. C/294 of the 3rd August, together with its enclosures, and also re-drafts of the three Agreements Marginal comments have been added to explain the chief points still in dispute between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Saudi Arabian Government. Notes are also enclosed on various other amendments which have been made, 2 . I see no objection to the omiss.: of the ?/ords 'in their name” from the preambles to the AgreementSo I cannot, however, accept the Saudi Arabian proposal that the Agreements should be drawn up in Arabic only, it is essential that there should be an English text of any agreement which is signed on behalf of His Majesty’s Government and which will subsequently be published as a White Paper, There is no analogy between these agreements and the Bon Voisinap;e Agreement of 1933 with Transjordan, to which His Majesty’s Government were not a party. A Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., e ’ to * &gt; etc., etc. , Jedda,0 ^lt.ii .1 ■■n —if ■ 3. Many drafting amendments have been made to which there is no reference in the notes. For example, the words 'between the respective territories' have been omitted from the preamble to the Agreement for Friendship and Neighbourly Relations, since it seems sufficient to say that good relations exist between the rulers and their families. I do not, however, wish to cause difficulties over questions of phraseology and you may at your discretion adopt in such matters any form of words which you consider necessary to meet the Saudi Arabian point of view. 4. It appears that the most serious point still outstanding is the question of 'Musabala', The Sheikh*s objection that it is impossible for Bedouin to obtain documents from the Saudi Arabian authorities every time they wish to cross the frontier into Koweit territory seems reasonable, - it must at any rate be difficult for them to do so; and I trust that you will be able to induce the Saudi Arabian Government to abandon their insistence on this provision. 5.
