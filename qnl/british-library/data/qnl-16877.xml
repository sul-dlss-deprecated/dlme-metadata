In response, it states that the Resident is ignorant of the tribe's recent history (which led them to becoming prisoners of the British) and of the tribe's circumstances prior to their removal. Nor is the Resident aware of what the British authorities previous attitude towards them was. As a result, it notes that the Resident has deferred addressing Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat, on the subject until he is better informed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x00001c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
