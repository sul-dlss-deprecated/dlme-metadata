I enclose a copy of a telegram from Bullard at Tehran about the grant by Persian representatives of vises for Persia. We propose to repeat to Tehran V/ylie f s telegram 325 and ask whether any new regulations, apart from the relaxation reported in Tehran telegram 783, have been issued, adding that we presume any local restrictions in the area occupied by our troops would depend on the travellers 1 nationality and the purpose of the journey. We would also ask Tehran to reply direct to Kabul if possible, but otherwise to reply via the Goverfifcfent of India. Perhaps you would let me know by telephone if you agree to our sending a telegram on these lines. F.o. E K&lt;JyvJ.
