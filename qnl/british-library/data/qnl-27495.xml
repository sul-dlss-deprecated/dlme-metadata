It is not possible to make anything else but a rough estimate of the proportion of the exports to Iran shown in Table 'P” of the Kuwait Trade Report for 194S-47 which are legitimately imported into that country, but enquiries reveal that the exports may be approximately divided as follows Mainly legally imported Mainly smuggled Partly imported Legally and partly smuggled. Cotton Raw Motor Cycles Radios Gunny bags Tyres Fat Cinamon Tubes Dates Black Pepper Cars Sugar Sheep Skins Blankets Iron Cardamon Piece Goods Soap Dried Fish Tobacco Merchandise Ginger Matches Attari Bicycles Cigarette paper Wool Si Cotton Thread Chillies Charcoal Tamarind Fish Oil Coir Ropes &lt;1 Mats Cigarettes Aluminium Coffee Bamboos Cement Chandals Tea Second hand clothing Vegetable ghee Oil Coconut Tumeric Timber. Approximate figures for exports to Saudi Arabia are enclosed. They are mainly by land and may all be regarded as legitimate. It has not been possible to obtain any figures for exports to Iraq by land, but it is believed that they are mainly illegally imported into that country and are of no very great volume. Sgd. M.P.O’C.

Political Department. Letter from Dated Rec. Formally acknowledged 19 Previous Papers :— g:&gt;po«tsReport on the Trade of Kuwait for the year 1943—1944 by Major M. P, O C. TANDY, POLITICAL AGENT, KUWAIT. PART I. (a) General Description. 1. Political Status. The only settled villages are Jahrah, at the head Kuwait is an Independent Arab State in special Treaty relations with His Majesty’s Goverrment. The Kuwait flag is a red rectangular flag with KUWAIT ” written in white Arabic characters. The Ruler’s personal flag has an additional Arabic inscription on the hoist a translation of which is “ THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD AND MOHAM MED IS HIS MESSENGER 2. The Frontier. Taking the old Political Agency as the centre the frontier follows an arc of a circle from the Southern part of Ras al Qulai’ah to its inters! ction with latitude 29 N, and then continues along this lati tude to the Batin near Rigai. The frontier turns North-East along the centre lino of the Batin to meet the latitude of a point 1050 yards South of Safwan. It then follows this latitude in an Easter ly direction towards Khor Zubair to the junctions of that Khor with Khor Abdullah after which it continues along the centre line of the latter Khor to the sea. The territory enclosed within this line and the Persian Gulf together with the islands Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failecha, ‘ Auhah, Kubbar, Karu, and Um-Al-Maradim is recognised as belonging to Kuwait. 3. Kuwait NehUral Territory. The tract of country bounded on the North by the southern portion of the Kuwait frontier as described above, on the East by the sea, and the West by the Shaqq and on the South by a straight line running due East frcm the Shaqq through Al Ain al ‘Abd to the sea North of Ras al Misha’ab, is recognised as ccmmcn to the two States of Nejd and Kuwait, in which both enjoy equal rights. 4. Population. The capital itself has a population of about 80,000 souls of whom the majority are Arabs. The Persian community, however, has greatly increased in recent years and now consists of about 11,000 souls. There are over 6,000 negroes, seme 300 Iraqis, one Jewish family, and a few British Indians engaged in trade. Outside the capital the inhabitants of the Amirate numbering about 12,000 souls are all Arabs and are f jr the most part nomadic. of the Kuwait bay, which has a population of about 1,000, Failecha village, on the island of the same name at the entrance of the Kuwait bay with a similar population, and the smaller villages of Hawaii, Dimnah, Fantas, Abu Hulaifah, Fuhaihil and Shu’aibah to the South and South-East of Kuwait. 5. Kuwait Toiwn. The town now measures about 3£ miles along the shore having extended considerably in recent years towards the East. Its greatest depth, about a mile and a quarter, is near the centre where the long suburb called Murqab has grown out towards the south. The streets are irregular and winding and the town is not laid out on any general plan but has grown up along the sea shore and round the cential market square known as the Safat. There are no buildings of any architectural interest or merit. Most of the houses being of the single story variety are comparatively low but appear high owing to a parapet wall enclosing the roof. There are over forty Mosques, of which nine are Friday Congregational Mosques, but none of them have any archaeological interest and follow closely the severe and simple style of those found in Nejd and the Wahabi capital of Riyadh. In the year 1920, the existing town wall was built by Shaikh Salim al Mubarak As Subah. It is about 5| miles in length and has four gates and, in addition to the gates which are protected by towers, there is a bastion every 200 yards throughout the length of the wall. At its base the wall is some 13 feet broad but tapers to 3 feet at the top. Its height is about 16 feet between towers. 6. Administration. The Ruler, Shaikh Sir Ahmed bin Jabir As Subah, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., is assisted in his Govern ment of the Amirate by an Advisory Council nominated from members of the Ruling family and the leading merchants. 7. Currency. Kuwait has no currency of its own. Business is normally transacted in Indian Rupees but Iraqi dinars, Saudi Rials and Maria Theresea Rials are accepted by merchants. Notes are now preferredto rupee coin as they are more easily handled and the bedouin visitors to the town having grown accustomed to them the previous objection to their use has been overcome. (B) Customs Administration. The Customs continued under indigenous mana- gemsnt and rates of duty rem lined unchanged. PART II. (A) Trade. While the main essential foodstuffs were sup plied by the U.K.C.C. and the Government of India at controlled (but high) prices, consumer goods became progressively scarcer and more expensive. Merchants benefitted very considerably by the substantial appreciation in the value of their pre war and pre-control stocks which resulted. While the application of quotas and controls by the G evernment of India with concomitant prc hibition of re-exports severely restricted the entrepot trade which has been for centuries essential to the pros perity of Kuwait it also enhanced very considerably the rise in prices noted above, Shortage of shipping, however, caused the ser vices of the ocean-going sailing boats, whose activi ties are one of the mainstays of Kuwait, to be in great demand, and the earnings of the “Safar”, or annual journey to Africa and India were computed at three and four times the pre-war average. Shortage of timber, however, began to make it self felt and construction and repair costs rose very considerably carrying freights with them. Although no budget is published it has been deduced that the takings of the customs for the year were Rs. 1,033,500 and that the profits of the landing and transportation company were Rs 30,000. (B) Financial. There was one bankruptcy, that of a dealer in gold sovereigns, during the year. The Imperial Bank of Iran continued to make satisfactory progress and the local community availed themselves of its services in increasing numbers. The following were the average exchange rates for the period under review :— 100 Maria Thorosea dollars 100 Saudi Rials , 1 Iraqi dinar . , 1 £ (Gold sovereign) . Rs. 325—00—0 „ 141—14—6 » 12-12—3 66 — 10—6 (C) Agriculture. Nil (D) Industry. 1. Ship Building. About one hundred sailing vessels of more than one hundred tons burden are bated on Kuwait| They are at sea for nine months in the year trading from Basrah to Mombasa via Aden, Calicut and Bombay. The principal cargoes carried are dates, sugar, rice, mangrove poles and teak wood. Those vessels were constructed locally of teak and are well found and seaworthy ships navigated by skilled captains and manned by experienced sailors. Approximately seven new vessels were built at an average cost of Rs. 35,000 during the period under review. Four ships were sunk. 2. Oil Production. The Kuwait Oil Company did not carry out drilling operations during the period under review. 3. Pearling. The number of boats trading has not changed materially since the last trade report. Catches have been slightly below the average but except for some Indian buying, the market was dull. The value of the catch was approximately Rs. 200,000 (E) Communication and Transport. 1. General. The landing of cargo from steamers is carried out by the Landing Company who own six lighters, three barges and two motor boats. There are three quays all of which are unap proachable at low water. There is a beacon at Ras al Ardh and the harbour is properly buoyed. Fresh meat is available at short notice for vessels calling at Kuwait. The steamers of the British India Steam Naviga tion Company normally call regularly twice a week but owing to war conditions the regular service has been somewhat interrupted. Freight rates continued to increase as shown below:— Steamers per ton (General Cargo) Kuwait . . . Sailing vessels per maund of dates of 168 lbs. 29-8-0 Kuwait—Karachi Kuwait—Aden . Kuwait—Bombay Kuwait—Malibar Karachi—Kuwait Bombay—Kuwait Aden—Kuwait . Rs. 7 Rs. 6 Rs. 6 Rs. 3 Rs. 93 Rs. 80 Rs. 80 Rs 40 per ton (Ap- proximately). Do. Do. Do. r Rs. 70 per ton. . Rs. 70 per ton. . Rs. 100 per ton.(2) Motor Transport. (F) Social. Goods are carried by motor lorry to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, and passengers to the above mentioned town and also to Zubair and Basrah in Iraq. The average charges for transport of Ijgoods to Riyadh, both summer and winter, was Rs. 24 per liundredweight and passengers rates averaged Rs. 28 to Riyadh and Rs. 15 and Rs. 20 respectively to Zubair and Basrah. There are no fxed rates for camel transport. No air service now calls at Kuwait. (3) Roads, A new road has been constructed running from His Highness’ Dasman Palace, on the East through the town and ends at the Jahra gate, at the West ern end. It is the first asphalted road in K uwa it and was constructed by the Kuwait Oil Com pany. (4) Communications. The new Kuwait-Basrah telegraph line is now in good order and it is being operated by the Indian Post and Telegraph Department. Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited have con tinued to operate their publip wireless telegraphy service efficiently. The Post and Telegraph Department of the Government of India took charge of the Kuwait Post Office in February, 1&lt;)42, and are still operating it. Mails are carried to and from Basrah twice weekly by the Kuwait-Zubaij: Motor Transport Company. (1) General. The standard of living remains comparatively high and the cost of living higher still at the end of the year. Wag s stood at 400% to 10 &gt;% above pre-war level. All available labour was in full employment generally, owing largely to the barge-building activities of the I.W.T. The Municipal Committee is responsible for the maintenance and cleanliness of the roads and the sanitary condition of the markets. The Committee are also concerned with watch and ward which is financed by a municipal tax of annas two per tin of petrol and a house tax of rupees one annas four for large shops, houses or godowns, and annas twelve for those of smaller size. (2) Lighting etc. The town is supplied with electricity by a private company at the rate of annas six a unit for light and annas four for power. There is also an ice factory which has worked satisfac torily. (3) Education. The Kuwait Government maintain four boys schools and two girls schools in the capital and four boys schools in the villages. The teaching staff is largely recruited from Syria and Egypt. There are ten Egyptian male teachers, two Egyp tian female teachers and nine Syrian female teachers engaged by the Kuwait Education De partment. In addition to the Go\ ernment schools th ere arc some twenty Quraan schools in the V'wn. (Sgd.) M.P.O’C.

Dear Clough-Taylor, I spoke to you last February about a request from the Japanese Embassy for trade statistics in respect of Bahrein. The request led us to enquire whether the annual Trade Deports for Bahrein (and for Koweit and Muscat) were to be treated as confidential, or 'for official use only', or whether they were in fact made available to the public generally. The result of our enquiry, which I promised to let you know, shows that all these Trade Reports are given a fairly wide local distribution; they are compiled with a view to assisting trade interests generally and are regarded as in no sense confidential. In the circumstances the Political Resident and the Government of India see no objection to the Japanese Embassy being given a copy of the latest Trade Report/ E.L.F. Clough-Taylor, Esq., Department of Overseas Trade, 35, Old Queen Street, 8.17.1.Report for Bahrein. v, e feel however that this is hardly the time to be helpful to the Japanese and we propose not to send the report to the Embassy unless they again aslc for the information. They have not made any reference to the matter since last February. Yours sincerely, J o OIBSONLetter from the Political Agent, Kuwait, No. 566/27/12, dated the 19th August 1938.

Freight, Shipping and Navigation .— See Trade Report for the year 1932- 33. (а) for general remarks see Trade Report for the year 1932-33. (б) The rate of freight by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers was Rs. 13-12-0 from Bombay or Karachi to Kuwait, and vice versa. Communications .— (а) For general remarks see Trade Report for the year 1932-33. (б) With effect from 23rd February 1938 Im perial Airways discontinued calling at Kuwait. ft. Boat Building .—Forty nine boats of an aggre gate value of Rs. 70,100 were built in Kuwait during the year under review. Of these one had a carrying capacity of 240 tons. These figures are not included in the Trade Report. Many smaller rowing boats were also built which it is unnecessary to enumerate. The increase is due to the growing reputation of the Kuwait boats. 10. Labour .—The average price of labour was as follows :— 1. An unskilled labourer From Re. 1 to Re. 1-8 p. d. 2. A Carpenter . . From Rs. 3 to Rs. 5 p. d. 3. A boat builder . . From Rs. 3 to Rs. 4 p. d. 11. The Year 1937-38 .—The year under review was again not a favourable one for trade, although ii showed a slight improvement in the exports of the immediately preceding 12 months, owing to the increased trade with the Saudi Coastal ports and Dubai. This must be put down to the depression in pearl trade which has been the chief industry of Kuwait and the fact that there was practically no trade with Nejd. The pearl “ catch ” on the whole was good, as also the prices. According to the Customs export figures some Rs. 2,58,000 worth of pearls were estimated to have been ex ported for sale in India and elsewhere. But this figure as explained under “ exports ’ cannot be relied on in any way. 12. Imports. —The total imports by sea amounted to Rs. 54,77,488 which showed an increase of 46-62 per cent, as compared with the figures for 1936-37. This increase is accounted for by the known increase in the imports of tea, specie, coffee and cement. Of the total import trade 46-86 per cent, was with India, 8-92 per cent, with Iraq, 13-65 per cent, with Persian Coast, 2-12 per cent, with the United King dom, 7-92 per cent, with Japan, 9-41 per cent, with Arab Coast and 11-12 per cent, with other countries. 13. Exports. —The total exports by sea amounted to Rs. 23,20,075 and showed an increase of 31-80 per cent, as compared w-ith the figures for 1936-37. This is accounted for by a marked increase in the export of wool, barley and tea. Pearls of the aggre gate amount of Rs. 2,58,000 are shown in the tables as having been exported for sale to Indian markets, but accurate figures of these as well as of specie can, as mentioned elsewherej never be obtained, as both are nearly always carried away amongst personal luggage. Of the total export trade 38-20 per cent, was with India, 34-42 per cent, with Arab Coast, 17-39 per cent, with Iraq, 7-93 per cent, with Persian Coast and 2-06 per cent, with other countries. 14.

Public Health. —During the year there were no epidemics. The health of the town on the whole was good, but Tuberculosis and Abdominal com plaints took their usual toll, the latter especially among infants. Ear and eye diseases being as common as previous years. PART n. (A) Trade. General Conditions. —At the present time Kuwait is passing through a stage of transition from a Bedouin to a more or less modern town. People’s wants are definitely increasing and becoming diverse in character. The change has been all the more rapid since the opening up of the overland route to Iraq. Similarly the advent of Imperial Airways on the Arab side of the Gulf and the fact that Kuwait has become a regular port of call for the East and West-bound aircraft, have also had a considerable civilising effect on the Kuwait population as a whole. 2. Kuwait, which grows neither wheat, barley, rice, K dates, the staple food needs of the Arabs, pro duces nothing to meet her own needs ; for all her requirements she depends on foreign countries. India supplies Kuwait with most of her foodstuffs, t.e., rice, sugar, tea, flour, etc. ; Japan with piece- goods, hardware and a large variety of miscellaneous articles, etc.; and Iraq with wheat, barley, dates, tobacco, cigarettes, articles of earthenware, etc. 3. In addition to the requirements of the popula tion of the town itself—estimated to be some 60,000 souls, and of her nomad tribes numbering about 20,000, Kuwait imports large quantities of food stuffs which find their way into the territories of neighbouring States and help to support the great Bedouin tribes of North East Arabia and of the Southern desert of Iraq. This fact coupled to the advantage of possessing a fine natural harbour (one of the best in the Gulf) makes Kuwait an important trade centre on the Arab side of the Persiace Gulf. New Items of Trade. —There was evident during the year under review of a gradual rise in the import of western goods and mechanical things, among which electric goods may be noted in particular. An opportunity remains in 1938 for still further exploitation of this latter market. 6. Grotvth of Foreign Competition. —Of late years, foreign competition has grown to a formidable extent in the Kuwait market. The latest and most formidable entrant in the field being Japan. Italian, German and Russian goods have in turn had their day and practically disappeared. At present Japanese goods alone preponderate over all others in the local bazaars. 7. The Russians. —The position so far as Russian goods are concerned continued to be the same as in the previous year. Russia practically ceased to trade during the year 1934-35 and there was no attempt at a revival during the year under review. 8. Japanese. —Japan continued to exploit the Kuwait market as was reported last year. Their goods retained their popularity almost to the elusion of those of all other nationalities. Th^^^ quality of most of their goods has been inferior and often bad but they have possessed the all im portant advantage of extreme cheapness. The majority of the inhabitants of Kuwait earn little more than suffices to eke out a bare existence. To be readily saleable therefore everything must be of the lowest possible price whatever its quality or lasting properties may be. 9. Japanese Methods. —As reported on in detail _ last yesLT.i**^*^ A***? O' I*** I** L 10. Suggestion for Meeting Competition. —There is nothing further to add to the detailed suggestions given under this head in last year’s Report. (B) Financial. 11. There are as pointed out in the previous Report no European managed banks in Kuwait and transfers of money to foreign countries are either made by means of International Money Order through the Post Office or by drafts through local Arab bankers or through banks in Basra. Two banks, the Ottoman and the Eastern, have been negotiating with the Ruler for permission to open a branch. (C) Taxation. 12. An indirect tax in the form of a duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem is levied on imports into Kuwait. This bears very lightly on people and its effect on purchasing power of the consumer is insignificant. Under agreement with His Majesty’s Government articles imported by British subjects pay only 4 per cent. duty. (D) Military. 13. Commandeering of Transport. Effects of Conscription. The questions do not arise ^ since Kuwait military system is that of a tribal . type. (E) Agriculture. 14. As stated above, neither Kuwait nor its en vironments can boast of arty agricultural resources. There are no date plantations of any value, no fields and not many kitchen gardens. The Island of Failaka and the villages to the south-east of Kuwait supply a limited but increasing quantity of vegetables and melons. The agricultural centre in the principality is Jahrah (situated some 25 miles south-west of Kuwait) which has greatly3 improved during the year owing to the facilities afforded by motor transport in taking the products into town. The village has over 2,500 date trees, under which wheat, barley and lucrene, melon, water melons, pumpkins, beans and some other vegetables are grown in increasing quantities. The above crops are mostly irrigated but a small amount '^of wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone. The agriculture of Jahrah might be considerably increased if more money were sunk in it. The second most important agricultural centre is the Island of Failakah where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches. The island also produces vegetables especially car rots which are of an exceptionally line quality but the agriculture is generally inferior to that of Jahrah. 15. As will be seen from what has been said above, from an agricultural point of view the value of land in Kuwait is very little. Except in case of land surrounding the town, which can be useful for building purposes, land is free and everybody is at liberty to take up any unoccupied piece and develop it. The Kuwait Government keeps no records of land holdings, nor is any land revenue charged to the cultivators. Except, therefore, for a few of the tracts of land in the environs of the town, which are held by private owners and which change hands as any other property does, land is not hypothecated. (F) Industry. 16. General. —As has been already stated Kuwait has no industries worth the name, of her own. The reasons for this state of affairs are as under :— (а) Shyness of Capital. (б) Limited and uncertain market. (c) Influx of cheap Japanese goods as a result of low customs duty, which tends to kill industrial initiative. 17. The only manufactures of which Kuwait can boast are as follows :— (a) A cloth called “ Darry Bisht ”, which is manufactured as a cottage industry by a primitive type of handloom and is exclusively used for making c ‘ Bisht ” or Arab cloaks (known also as ‘ Abbas). This cloth is woven from sheep’s wool and the thread is spun locally by poor classes of Arabs as a sort of spare time job. It is usually available in lengths of 6 to 6£ yards, which cost one an average from £0-10-8 to £0-13-4 a piece. A roll • or piece, sufficient for one cloak, takes from 4 to 10 days to weave. (6) Kuwait is well known over the whole of the Persian Gulf for boat (sailing) building. Figures regarding number and tonnage of boats built during the year under report appear on page 1 of Part I of this Report. (c) Fish Oil, boat sails, ropes, etc., etc., are also manufactured for local use. 18. New Industries Introduced. —Nil. 19. Government Encouragement. —Nil. 20. Use of Electricity in Industry. — In view of extremely backward state of industry the use of electricity in manufacture is unknown, and is hardly likely to develop for some years at least if ever. 23. Demand for Foreign Machinery. —Demand for foreign machinery is insignificant. The only machi nery used is in motor boats and launches of wdiich about a dozen exist at Kuwait. 22. Development of Mines. —Kuwait is, as far as is known, very poor in mineral resources. The only mineral product is gypsum mortar, which is manu factured by the simple process of firing rubbish in broad shallow excavations. There is a large gypsiferous tract on the outskirts of Kuwait town and it is found in several other parts of the prin cipality. No. 2 well of the Kuwait Oil Company (a half American half British concern) which hold the con cession for exploration and development of oil in Kuwait territory, produced oil of good quality and pressure during the period under review. (G) Communications and Transport. 23. General. —As mentioned elsewhere the chief means of transport between Kuwait and other ports of the Persian Gulf is by the local dhows engaged in overseas trade carrying, as distinguished from pearl fishing, etc., or by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company, which call here fortnightly. Besides the above and a motor road between Kuwait and Basra and another from Kuwait to Riyadh there are no regular roads. This is due to the fact that the interior though it consists of flat and generally hard desert which can be traversed in nearly every direction by motor cars, is not at all an easy country to travel in. The great obstacle is complete lack of supplies and extreme scarcity of water. The only regular means of transport is by camel along definite routes. 24. Advent of the Motor Car.—In view of the undeveloped state of the hinterland it has not hitherto been found either convenient or profitable to employ motor as a means of transport. The motor service between Kuwait and Basra carried passengers only. Camel, therefore, as already stated, still remains the chief and indispensable menus of transport.4 25. Air Service. —Imperial Airways stopped calling at Kuwait as from 23rd February 1938. 26. Security. —The Kuwait-Basra route is quite safe, but perhaps the same cannot be said of minor routes between Kuwait and the hinterland. This is because of the desert nature of the country, occu pied only by nomad tribes, who are not above occasionally raiding a caravan carrying merchan dise, etc., should the local powers that be for a moment relax. (H) Social. 27. Standard of Living. —The majority of Kuwait population are poor and about 10,000 souls (out of a total of approximately 60,000) have to eke out an existence on little more than one anna a day each, while most of the Bedouin population subsist on camel’s milk and dates. The standard of living is thus seen to be low but the people on the whole are happy and appear content enough with their lot: The cost of living is cheap. A quarter of an anna will buy a large loaf of bread. 28. Employment. —Pearl fishing is the chief in dustry of the inhabitants of the town. Apart from some 2,000 persons engaged in business and other minor occupations, the rest of the population depend for their livelihood on pearl fishing directly or in directly. The pearl season starts about the end of May and continues for the best part of the summer. The Kuwait pearling fleet consists of 700 boats but only 200 to 300 boats put to sea in recent years. The pearl trade absorbs about 6 to 7 thousand men in various capacities, viz., Nakhudas of boats, divers and haulers. An additional one thousand persons find employ ment in subsidiary trades like manufacture of boat sails, ropes, fish oil, etc. Since, as mentioned above the pearl season lasts only for about five months in the year, divers and others have to look for employment in other direc tions for the remainder of the time. About half of them take to sea, fishing, wood cutting, etc., the rest becoming coolies and engaging in petty trading or going out into the desert with camels and sheep. 29. Evidence of Emigration . —In spite of the poverty and lack of sufficient employment, which have been aggravated by the depressed condition of the pearl trade during the past few years, there is no tendency to emigrate among the people of Kuwait. On the other hand a number of Persian, Iraqi and Nejdi immigrants have in the recent past taken up residence in Kuwait. 30. Municipal Services. —Kuwait is believed to be the cleanest and also perhaps the healthiest town in the Persian Gulf. This is partly due to the comparatively dry and wholesome climate of the place, and partly to the comparatively efficient municipal services. During the past few years some of the narrow and overcrowded bazaars of the town have been widened and otherwise improved by the Municipality.

S. dcGaury, M. c., Political Agent, Kuwait- PART I. See Trade Report for the year 1932-33. 1. General. 2. Currency. 3. Weights and Measures. 4. Pearl Fishing. 5. Customs Administra tion and Lighterag . 6. Sea Fisheries. 7. Freight, Shipping and Navigation. —(a) for general remarks see Trade Report for the year 1932-33. (b) The rate of freight by the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamers was Rs. 12-8-0 from Bombay or Karac hi to Kuwait, and vice versa. 8. Communications. — (a) For general remarks see Trade Report for the year 1932-33. (h) During the year under review Imperial Airways continued to call twice a week either way, weather and punctuality permitting. 9. Boat Building .—Forty boats of an aggregate value of Rs. 1,00,900 were built in Kuwait during the year under review. Of these two had a carry ing capacity of 230 tons each. These figures are not included in the Trade Report. Many smaller rowing boats were also built which it is unnecessary to enumerate. The increase is due to the growing reputation of the Kuwait boats. 10. Labour. —The average price of labour was as follows :— 1. An unskilled labourer 2. A carpenter . 3. A boat builder From Rs. 0-12-0 to Rs. 1-8-0 p. d. From Rs. 2-8-0 to Rs. 3-8-0 p. d. From Rs. 2-8-0 to Rs. 3-8-0 p. d. 11. The year 1935-36.—The year under review was again not a favourable one for trade, although it showed an improvement in the imports and exports of the immediately preceding 12 months. This must be put down to the depression in pearl M29EAD trade which has been the chief industry of Kuwait and the fact that there was practically no trade with Nejd. The Pearl “ catch ” on the whole was again not good and the market remained low. According to the Customs export figures, some Rs. 235,200 worth of pearls were estimated to have been exported for sale in India and elsewhere. But this figure as explained under “ Exports ” cannot be relied on in any way. 12. Imports .—The total imports by sea amounted to Rs. 49,16,047, which showed an increase of 18-3 per cent, as compared with the figures for 1934-35. This increase is accounted for by— (a) increased demand for luxries and a higher standard of living, (b) increase in the European population, (c) Visit of His Majesty King Ibn Saud with 700 men and very large orders given by His Majesty to Kuwait merchants, (d) greatly increased prosperity among carry ing ship owners more than offsetting decrease among pearling boat-owners, often same men. Of the total import trade 43‘2 per cent, was with India, 7 per cent, with Iraq, 15*4 per cent, with Persian Coast, 5 2 per cent, with the United Kingdom, 9‘2 per cent, with Japan, 2 per cent, with Arab Coast and 18 per cent, with other countries. 13. Exports .—The total exports by sea amounted to Rs. 14,21,840 and showed an increase of 15-4 per cent, compared with the figure for 1934-35, thus reverting to their 1933-34 level. This is accounted for by a marked increase in the export of specie and bullion silver. Pearls of the aggregate amount of Rs. 2,35,200 are shown in the tables as having been exported for sale to Indian markets, but accurate figures of these as well as of specie2 can, as mentioned elsewhere, never be obtained, as both are nearly always carried away amongst personal luggage. Of the total export trade 49-4 per cent, was wdth India, 23-8 per cent, with Arab Coast, 16 per cent, with Iraq, 3 per cent, with the Persian Coast, 5 per cent, with the United Kingdom and 2-8 per cent, with other countries. 14.

Public Health .—During the year there were no epidemics. The health of the town on the wdiole was good, but Tuberculosis and Abdominal com plaints took their ususal toll, the latter especially among infants. Ear and eye diseases being as common as previous years. PART II. (A) Trade. General Conditions .—At the present time Kuwait is passing through a stage of transition from a Bedouin to a more or less modern town. People’s w r ants are definitely increasing and becoming diverse in character. The change has been all the more rapid since the opening up of the overland route to Iraq. Similarly the advent of Imperial Airways on the Arab side of the Gulf and the fact that Kuwait has become a regular port of call for the East and Westbound aircraft, have also had a considerable civilising effect on the Kuwait popu lation as a whole. 2. Kuwait, which grows neither wheat, barley* rice, dates, the staple food needs of the Arab, produces nothing to meet her own needs : for all her requirements she depends on foreign countries. India supplies Kuwait wuth most of her foodstuffs, i.e., rice, sugar, tea, flour, etc.; Japan with piece- goods, hardware and a large variety of miscella neous articles, etc. ; and Iraq with wheat, barley, dates, tobacco, cigarettes, articles of earthenwares, etc. 3. In addition to the requirements of the popula tion of the town itself—estimated to be some 60,000 souls, and of her nomad tribes numbering about 20,000, Kuwait imports large quantities of foodstu ffs which find their way into the territories of neigh bouring States and help to support the great Bedouin tribes of North East Arabia and of the Southern desert of Iraq. This fact coupled to the advantage of possessing a fine natural harbour (one of the best in the Gulf) makes Kuwait an important trade centre on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. New Items of Trade .—There was evident during the year under review a gradual rise in the import of western goods and mechanical things, among which electric goods may be noted in parti cular. An opportunity remains in 1937 for still further exploitation of this latter market. 6. Growth of Foreign Competition .—Of late years, foreign competition has grown to a formidable extent in the Kuw r ait market. The latest and most formidable entrant in the field being Japan. Italian, German, and Russian goods have in turn had their day and practically disappeared. At present Japanese goods alone preponderate over all others in the local bazaars. 7. The Russians .—The position so far as Russian goods are concerned continued to be the same as in the previous year. Russia practically ceased to trade during the year 1934-35 and there was no attempt at a revival daring the year under review. 8. Japanese .—Japan continued to exploit the Kuwait market as was reported last year. Their goods retained their popularity almost to the ex clusion of those of all other mationalities. The quality of most of their goods has been inferior and often bad but they have possessed the all important advantage of extreme cheapness. The majority of the inhabitants of Kuwait earn little more than suffices to eke out a bare existence. To be readily saleable therefore everything must be of the lowest possible price whatever its quality or lasting properties may be. 9. Japanese Methods .—As reported on in detail last year. 10. Suggestions for Meeting Competition .—There is nothing further to add to the detailed suggestions given under this head in last year’s Report. (B) Financial. 11. There are as pointed out in the previous Report no banks in Kuwait and transfers of money to foreign countries are either made by means of3 International Money Order throngh the Post Office or through Banks in Basra. This total absence of exchange facilities is a gerat drawback and a considerable hendicap in the conduct of quick business transactions. The reason for the absence of banks is threefold :— (a) Inadequate volume of trade, (b) Religious prejudice of people against charging interest on capital, and (c) Owners’ reluctance to entrust money out of their own hands. 12. Apropos of (c) above: people of Kuwait not unlike those of so many other backward countries, are in the habit of hoarding money to a very large extent. The case may here be cited of a typical Kuwaiti capitalist, who made a fortune in the pearl trade and who is by far the richest man in Kuwait. It is said that he still keeps all his cash in an underground cellar, takes a periodical check of his money (silver) by weighing it, and on finding it correct locks the cellar again till the next check falls due. 13. The same attitude applies to smaller money holders who appear to feel more at ease with their money under lock and key or buried underground than when it is invested in some way. 13-A. This attitude of capitalists, both large and small, lias undoubtedly an adverse effect on the money market. It tends to an unnecessary with drawal of money from circulation and ultimately results in contraction of currency and tightness of money. (C) Taxation. 14. An indirect tax in the form of a duty of 4£ per cent, ad valorein is levied on imports into Kuwait. This bears very lightly on people and its effect on purchasing power of the consumer is insignificant. Under agreement with His Majesty’s Government articles imported by British subjects pay only 4 per cent. duty. (D) Military. 19. Commandeering * &gt; | The questions do not of Transport.

As stated above, neither Kuwait nor its environments can boast of any agricultural re sources. There are no date plantations of any value, no fields and not many kitchen gardens. The villages to the south-east of Kuwait supply a limited but increasing quantity of vegetables and melons. The agricultural centre in the princi pality is Jahrah (situated some 25 miles south-west of Kuwait) which has greatly improved during the year owing to the facilities afforded by motor transport in taking the products into town. The village has over 2,500 date trees, under which wheat, barley and lucerne, melons, water melons, pumpkins, beans and some other vegetables are grown in increasing quantities. The above crops are mostly irrigated but a nmall amount of wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone. The agriculture of Jahrah might be considerably increased if more money were sunk in it. The second most important agricultural centre is the island of Falaikah where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches. The island also produces vegetables especially carrots which are of an excep tionally fine quality but the agriculture is generally inferior to that of Jahrah. 17. As will be seen from what has been said al o /e, from an agricultural point of view the value of land in Kuwait is very little. Except in case of land surrounding the Town, which can be useful for building purposes, land is free and everybody is at liberty to take up any unoccupied piece and develop it. The Kuwait Government keeps no records of land holdings, nor is any land revenue charged to the cultivator. Except, therefore, for a few of the tracts of land in the environs of the Town, which are held by private owners and which change hands as any other property does, land is not hypothecated. (F) Industry. 18. General .—As has been already stated Kuwait has no industries worth the name, of her own. The reasons for this state of affairs are as under :— (а) Shyness of Capital (See remarks under head FINANCIAL, page 2) and lack of enter prise among local people. (б) Limited and uncertain market. (c) Influx of cheap Japanese goods as a result of low customs duty, which tends to kill industrial initiative.4 19. The only manufactures of which Kuwait can boast are as follows :— (a) A cloth called “ Darry Basht ”, which is manufactured as a cottage industry by a primitive type of handloom and is exclu sively used for making “ Bisht ” or Arab cloaks (known also as Abbas). This cloth is woven from sheep’s wool and the thread is spun locally by poor classes of Arabs as a sort of spare time job. It is usually available in lengths of 6 to yards, which cost on an average from £0-10-8 to £0-13-4 a piece. A roll or piece, sufficient for one cloak, takes from 4 to 10 days to weave. (b) Kuwait is well known over the whole of the Persian Gulf for boat (sailing) building. F gures regarding number and tonnage of boats built during the year under report appear on page 1 of Part I of this Report. (c) Fish Oil, boat sails, ropes, etc., etc., are also manufactured for local use. 20. Neiv Industries Introduced — Nil. 21. Government Encouragement .— Nil. 22. Use of Electricity in Industry. —In view of extremely backward state of industry the use of electricity in manufacture is unknown, and is hardly likely to develop for some years at least if ever. 23. Demand for Foreign Machinery. —Demand for foreign machinery is insignificant. The only machinery used is in motor boats and launches of which about a dozen exist at Kuwait. 24. Development of Mines. —Kuwait is very poor in mineral resources. The only mineral product is gypsum mortar, which is manufactured by the simple process of firing rubbish in broad shallow excavations. There is a large gypsiferous tract on the outskirts of Kuwait Town and it is found in several other parts of the Principality. The Kuwait Oil Company (a half American half British concern) which hold the concession for exploration and development of Oil in Kuwait territory, except the Neutral Zone, had not begun boring during the period under review but certain members of their staff and some material arrived bet ween January and April. (G) Communications and Tronsport. 25. General. —As mentioned elsewhere the chief means of transport between Kuwait and other ports of the Persian Gulf is by the local dhows engaged in overseas trade carrying, as distiguished from pearl fishing, etc., or by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company, whicli call regularly every week. Besides the above and a motor road between Kuwait and Basra there are no regular roads con necting Kuwait with the hinterland and Saudi Arabia. This is due to the fact that the interior through it consists of flat and generally hard desert which can be traversed in nearly every direction by motor cars, is not at all an easy country to travel in. The great obstacle is complete lack of suppleis and extreme scarcity of water. The only regular means of transport is by camel along definite routes. 26. Advent of the Motor Car .—In view of the undeveloped state of the hinterland it has not hitherto been found either convenient or profitable to employ motor as a means of transport. The motor service between Kuwait and Basra carried passengers only. Camel, therefore, as already stated, still remains the chief and indispensable means of transport. 27. Air Service .—A duplicate East and West bound service of the Imperial Airways continued to call at Kuwait every week during the period under review—though at times not so regularly. Hitherto the Company has restricted its activi ties to carrying of mails only as distinguished from commercial freight, as far as Kuwait is concerned. 28. Security .—The Kuwait-Basra route is quite safe, but perhaps same cannot be said of minor routes between Kuwait and the hinterland. This is because of the desert nature of the countrv, occupied only by nomad tribes, who are not above occasionally raiding a caravan carrying merchan dise, etc., should the local Powers that be for a moment show carelessness or get slack. (H) Social. 29. Standard of Living.—lhe majority of Kuwait population are poor and about 10,000 souls (out of a total of approximately 60,000) have to eke out an existence on little more than one anna a day each, while most of the Bedouin population subsist on camels milk and dates. The standard of living e5 -♦ is thus seen to be low but the people on the whole are happy ami appear content enough with their lot. The cost of living is cheap. A quarter of an anna will buy a large loaf of bread while Japan supplies the wherewithal to clothe a man at amaz ingly low prices. 30. Employment- Pearl fishing is the chief industry of the inhabitants of the town. Apart from some 2.000 persons engaged in business and other minor occupations, the rest of the population depend for their livelihood on ])earl fishing directly or indirectly. The pearl season starts about the end of May and continues for the best part of the Summer. The Kuwait pearling fleet consists of 700 boats but only 200 to 300 boats put to sea in recent yars. The pearl trade absorbs about 6 to 7 thousand men in various, capacities, viz., Nakhudas of boats, divers and haulers. An additional one thousand persons find employ ment in subsidiary trades like manufacture of boat sails, ropes, fish oil, etc. Since, as mentioned above the pearl season lasts only for about five months in the year, divers and others have to look for employment in other direc tions for the remainder of the time. About half of them take to sea, fishing, wood cutting, etc., the rest becoming coolies and enaging in petty trading or going out into the desert with camels and sheep. Like all other countries Kuwait has her unemploy ed numbering' about 5,000, who live on their relatives. ... For prices of vaiious types of labour see Part I. 31. Evidence uf Evuyration .—laspite of the poverty and lack of sufficient employment, which have been aggravated by the depressed condition of the pearl trade during the past few years, there is no tendency to emigrate among the people of Kuwait. On the other hand there is a considerable number of Persian, Iraqi and Nejdi immigrants who have in the recent past taken up residence in Kuwait. 32., Municipal Services .—Kuwait is believed to be the cleanest and also perhaps the healthiest town in the Persian Gulf. This is partly due to the dry and wholesome climate of the place and partly to the efficient municipal services. During the past few years most of the narrow and overcrowded bazaars of the town have been widened and otherwise improved by the Municipa lity. His Excellency the Ruler himself takes a M29EAD keen interest in the sanitation and general welfare of his people. PART III. Exchange. Months. Rat* 100 Maria Thresa Dollars. PER Sovereign. Rs. A. P.

See Trade Report ► for the year 1932- 33. 7. Freight, Shipping and Navigation. — (a) For general remarks see Trade Report for the year 1932-33. (h) The rate of freight by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers was Rs. 12-8-0 from Bombay or Karachi to Kuwait, and vice versa. 8. Communications. —(a) For general remarks see Trade Report for the year 1932-33. (b) During the year under review Imperial Air ways continued to call twice a week either way, weather and punctuality permitting. 9. Boat Building. —Twenty-three boats of an aggregate value of Rs. 77,250 were built in Kuwait during the year under review. Of these one had a carrying capacity of 240 tons. These figures are not included in the Trade Report. Many smaller rowing boats were also built which it is unneces sary to enumerate. The increase is due to the grow ing reputation of the Kuwait boats. 10. Labour .—The average price of labour was as follows :— 1. An unskilled labourer From Rs. 1 to Re. 1-8 p.d. 2. A Carpenter . . From Rs. 3 to Rs. 5 p. d. 3. A boat builder . . From Rs. 3 to Rs. 4 p. d- of the year under review on account of the Corona tion. According to the Customs export figures some Rs. 1,10,000 worth of pearls were estimated to have been exported for sale in India and else where. But this figure as explained under “ ex ports ” cannot be relied on in any way. 12. Imports .—The total imports by sea amounted to Rs. 42,47,550 which showed a decrease of 15-66 per cent, as compared with the figures for 1935-36. This decrease is accounted for by the known de crease in the imports of tea, matches, coffee and cement. Of the total import trade 39 , 95 per cent, was with India, 10-91 per cent, with Iraq, 14-53 per cent, with Persian Coast, 2-89 per cent, with the United Kingdom, 7-73 per cent, with Japan, 5-32 per cent, with Arab Coast and 18-67 per cent, with other countries. 13. Exports .—The total exports by sea amounted to Rs. 15,82,295 and showed an increase of 11-29 per cent, compared with the figures for 1935-36 ; thus reverting to their 1933-34 level. This is accounted for by a marked increase in the export of lambskins. Pearls of the aggregate amount of Rs. 1,10,000 are shown in the tables as having been exported for sale to Indian markets, but accu rate figures of these as well as of specie can, as mentioned elsewhere, never be obtained, as both are nearly always carried away amongst personal luggage. Of the total export trade 32-27 per cent, was with India, 36-17 per cent, with Arab Coast, 26-89 per cent, with Iraq, 4-11 per cent, with Persian Coast and 0-56 per cent, with other countries. 14. Rainfall .— 11. The Year 1936-37 .—The year under review was again not a favourable one for trade, although it showed a slight improvement in the exports of the immediately preceding 12 months. This must be put down to the depression in pearl trade which has been the chief industry of Kuwait and the fact that there was practically no trade with Nejd. The pearl “ catch ” on the whole was again not good, but the market improved slightly towards the end April, 1936 . Inches. •52 May, 1936 . •66 November, 1936 •38 December, 1936 115 January, 1937 •62 February, 1937 •922 15. Public Health. —During the year there were no epidemics. The health of the town on the whole was good, but Tuberculosis and Abdominal com plaints took their usual toll, the latter especially among infants. Ear and eye diseases being as common as previous years. PART n. (A) Trade. General Conditions. —At the present time Kuwait is passing through a stage of transition from a Bedouin to a more or less modern town. People s wants are definitely increasing and becoming diverse in character. The change has been all the more rapid since the opening up of the overland route to Iraq. Similarly the advent of Imperial Airways on the Arab side of the Gulf and the fact that Kuwait has become a regular port of call for the East and Westbound aircraft, have also had a considerable civilising effect on the Kuwait population as a whole. 2. Kuwait, which grows neither wheat, barley, rice, dates, the staple food needs of the Arab, pro duces nothing to meet her own needs: and for all her requirements she depends on foreign countries. India supplies Kuwait with most of her foodstuffs, i.e., rice, sugar, tea, flour, etc. ; Japan with piece- goods, hardware and a large variety of miscellane ous articles, etc. ; and Iraq with wheat, barley, dates, tobacco, cigarettes, articles of earthenwares, etc. 3. In addition to the requirements of the popula tion of the town itself—estimated to be some 00,000 souls, and of her Nomad tribes numbering about 20,000, Kuwait imports large quantities of food stuffs which find their way into the territories of neighbouring States and help to support the great Bedouin tribes of North East Arabia and of the Southern desert of Iraq. This fact coupled to the advantage of possessing a fine natural harbour (one of the best in the Gulf) makes Kuwait an im portant trade centre on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. 4. New Items of Trade .—There was evident during the year under review a gradual rise in the import of western goods and mechanical things, among which electric goods may be noted in particular. An opportunity remains in 1937 for still further exploitation of this latter market. 5. Growth of Foreign Competition. —Of late years, foreign competition has grown to a formidable ex tent in the Kuwait market. The latest and most formidable entrant in the field being Japan. Italian, German and Russian goods have in turn had their day and practically disappeared. At present Japanese goods alone preponderate over all others in the local bazaars. 6. The Russians. —The position so far as Russian goods are concerned continued to be the same as in the previous year. Russia practically ceased to trade during the year 1934-35 and there was no attempt at a revival during the year under review. 7. Japanese. —Japan continued to exploit the^p^ Kuwait market as was reported last year- Thei^ goods retained their popularity almost to the ex clusion of those of all other nationalities. The quality of most of their goods has been inferior and often bad but they have possessed the all im portant advantage of extreme cheapness. The majority of the inabitants of Kuwait earn little more than suffices to eke out a bare exist ence. To be readily saleable therefore everything must be of the lowest possible price whatever its quality or lasting properties may be. 8. Japanese Methods. —As reported on in detail last year. 9. Suggestion for Meeting Competition. —There is nothing further to add to the detailed suggestions given under this head in last year’s Report. (B) Financial. 10. There are as pointed out in the previous Report no European managed banks in Kuwait and transfers of money to foreign countries are either made by means of International Money Order through the Post Office or by drafts through local Arab bankers or through banks in Basra. Two banks, the Ottoman and the Eastern, have been negotiating with the Ruler for permission to open a branch. (C) Taxation. 11. An indirect tax in the form of a duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem is levied on imports into Kuwait. This bears very lightly on people and its effect on purchasing power of the consumer is insignificant. Under agreement with His Majesty’s Government articles imported by British subjects pay only 4 per cent. duty. (D) Military. 12. Commandeering &gt; The questions do not arise of Transport. / since Kuwait military Effects of Conscription. \ system is that of a tribal J type. (E) Agriculture. 13. As stated above, neither Kuwait nor its environments can boast of any agricultural resources. There are no date plantations of any value, no fields and not many kitchen gardens. The Island of Failakah and the villages to the South-East pf Kuwait supply a limited but increasing quantity3 of vegetables and melons. The agricultural centre in the principality is Jahrah (situated some 25 miles south-west of Kuwait) which has greatly improved during the year owing to the facilities afforded by motor transport in taking the products into town. The village has over 2,500 date trees, under which wheat, barley and lucerne, melon, water melons, pumpkins, beans and some other vegetables are grown in increasing quantities. The above crops are mostly irrigated but a small amount of wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone. The agriculture of Jahrah might be considerably increased if more money were sunk in it. The second most important agricultural centre is the Island of Fail- akah where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches. The island also produces vegetables especially carrots which are of an exceptionally fine quality but the agriculture is generally inferior to that of Jahrah. 14. As will be seen from what has been said above, from an agricultural point of view the value of land in Kuwait is very little. Except in ease of land surrounding the Town, which can be useful for building purposes, land is free and everybody is at liberty to take up any unoccupied piece and develop it. The Kuwait Government keeps no records of land holdings, nor is any land revenue charged to the cultivator. ... Except, therefore, for a few of the tracts of land in the environs of the Town, which are held by private owners and which change hands as any other property does, land is not hypothecated. (F) Industry. 15. General.^As has been already stated Kuwait has no industries worth the name, of her own. The reasons for this state of affairs are as under :— (a) Shyness of Capital. (b) Limited and uncertain market. (c) Influx of cheap Japanese goods as a result of low customs duty, which tends to kill industrial initiative. 16. The only manufactures of which Kuwait can boast are as follows :— (a) A cloth called “ Darry Basht”, which is manufactured as a cottage industry by a primitive type of handloom and is exclusively used for making “ Basht ” or Arab cloaks (known also as Abbaa). This cloth is woven from sheep’s wool and the thread is spun locally by poor classes of Arabs as a sort of spare time job. It is usually available in lengths of 6 to 6^ yards, which cost on an average from £0-10-8 to £0-13-4 a piece. A roll or piece, sufficient for one cloak, takes from 4 to 10 days to weave. (6) Kuwait is well known over the whole of the Persian Gulf for boat (sailing) building. Figures regarding number and tonnage of boats built during the year under report appear on page 1 of Part I of this Report. (c) Fish oil, boat sails, ropes, etc., etc., are also manufactured for local use. 17. New Industries Introduced. —Nil. 18. Government Encouragement. —Nil. 19. Use of Electricity in Industry. —In view of extremely backward state of industry the use of electricity in manufacture is unknown, and is hardly likely to develop for some years at least if ever. 20. Demand for Foreign Machinery. —Demand for foreign machinery is insignificant. The only machi nery used is in motor boats and launches of which about a dozen exist at Kuwait. 21. Development of Mines. —Kuwait is, as far as is known, very poor in mineral resources. The only mineral product is gypsum mortar, which is manufactured by the simple process of firing rubbish in broad shallow excavations. There is a large gypsiferous tract on the outskirts of Kuwait town and it is found in several other parts of the Princi pality. The Kuwait Oil Company (a half American half British concern) which hold the concession for exploration and development of oil in Kuwait territory, except the Neutral Zone, had begun boring during the period under review on the north side of Kuwait Bay. (G) Communications and Transport. 22. General. —As mentioned elsewhere the chief means of transport between Kuwait and other ports of the Persian Gulf is by the local dhows engaged in overseas trade carrying, as distinguished from pearl fishing, etc., or by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company, which call regularly every week. - Besides the above and a motor road between Kuwait and Basra and another from Kuwait to Riyadh there are no regular roads. This is due to the fact that the interior though it consists of flat and generally hard desert which can be traversed in nearly every direction by motor cars, is not at all an easy country to travel in. The great obstacle is complete lack of supplies and extreme scarcity of water. The only regular means of transport is by camel along definite routes. 23. Advent of the Motor Car.In view of the undeveloped state of the hinter land it has not hitherto been found either convenient or profitable to employ motor as a means of transport. The motor service between Kuwait and Basra carried passengers only. Camel, therefore, as already stated,4 still remains the chief and indispensable means of 2L Air Service—X duplicate East and Westbound service of the Imperial Airways continued to call at Kuwait weekly during the period under review. Hitherto the Company has restricted its activities to carrying of mails only as distinguished irom commrecial freight, as far as Kuwait is concerned. 25. Security .—The Kuwait-Basra route is quite safe, but perhaps the same cannot be said of minor routes between Kuwait and the hinterland. Inis is because of the desert nature of the country, occupied only by nomad tribes, who are not above occasionally raiding a caravan carrying merchandise, etc., should the local Powers that be for a moment (H) Social. 26. Standard of Living.—The majority of Kuwait population are poor and about 10,000 souls (out of a total of approximately 60,000) have to eke out an existence on little more than one anna a day each, while most of the Bedouin population subsist on camel's milk and dates. The standard of living is thus seen to be low but the people on the whole are happy and appear content enough with their lot. The cost of living is cheap. A quarter of an anna will buy a large loaf of bread. 27. Employment .—Pearl fishing is the chief indus try of the inhabitants of the town. Apart from some 2,000 persons engaged in business and other minor occupations, the rest of the population depend for their livelihood on pearl fishing directly or indirectly. The pearl season starts about the end of May and continues for the best part of the Summer. The Kuwait pearling fleet consists of 700 boats but only 200 to 300 boats put to sea in recent years. The pearl trade absorbs about 6 to 7 thousand men in various capacities, viz., Nakhudas of boats, divers and haulers. An additional one thousand persons find employ ment in subsidiary trades like manufacture of boat sails, ropes, fish oil, etc. Since, as mentioned above the pearl season lasts only for about five months in the year, divers and others have to look for employment in other direc tions for the remainder of the time. About half of them take to sea, fishing, wood cutting, etc., the rest becoming coolies and engaging in petty trading or going out into the desert with camels and sheep. 28. Evidence of Emigration .—Inspite of the poverty and lack of sufficient employment, which have been aggravated by the depressed condition of the pearl trade during the past few years, there is no tendency to emigrate among the people of Kuwait. On the other hand a number of Persian, Iraqi and Nejdi immigrants have in the recent past taken up residence in Kuwait. . . ... , . , 29. Municipal Services .—Kuwait is believed to be the cleanest and also perhaps the healthiest town in the Persian Gulf. This is partly due to the comparatively dry and wholesome climate of the place, and partly to the comparatively efficienf municipal services. During the past few years some of the narrow and overcrowded bazaars of the town have been widened and otherwise improved by the Munici pality. PART ffl. Exchange. Rate per.

(b) The rate of freight by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers was Rs. 12-8-0 from Bombay or Karachi to Kuwait, and viee versa. 8. Communication. —(a) For general remarks see Trade Report for the year 1932-33. (6) During the year under review Imperial Air- ways duplicated their East and Westbound services,* their aircraft now call here regularly weather per mitting. 9. Boat Building.-—Twelve boats of an aggregate value of Rs. 80,700 were built in Kuwait, during the year under review. Of these one had a carrying capacity of 300 tons. These figures are not includ ed in the Trade Report. Many smaller rowing boats were also built which it is unnecessary to enumerate. 10. Labour .—The average price of labour was as follows :— 1. An unskilled labourer From Re. 0-12 to Re. 1-8 p.d. 2. A carpenter . . From Rs. 2-8 to Rs. 3-8 p.d. 3. A boat builder . . From Rs. 2-8 to Rs. 3-8 p.d- 11. The year 1934-35 .—The year under review was again not a favourable one for trade, although it showed an improvement in the imports of the immediately preceding 12 months. This must be put down to world depression and the fact that there was practically no trade with Nejd. The Pearl “ catch ” on the whole was again not good and the market remained low, According to the Customs export figures, some Rs. 3,64,000 worth of pearls were estimated to h av e been exported for sale in India and elsewhere. But this figure as explained under “ Exports ” cannot be relied on in any way. 12. Imports .—The total imports by sea amounted 1 to Rs. 41,55,515, which showed an increase of 7 per cent, as compared with the figures for 1933-34. These higher figures are the result of an increased i trade with the interior. Of the total import trade 35-4 per cent, was with India, 24-2 per cent, with Iraq, 10-8 per cent, with Persian Coast, 2-7 per cent, with Arab Coast and 26-9 per cent, with other countries. 13. Exports .—The total exports by sea amounted to Rs. 12,02,316 and showed a decrease of .15-2 per cent, compared with the figure for 1933-34. This is accounted for by the known decreased export in pearls, hides and skins, specie, sugar (loaf ancT soft), building materials, dates^etc., etc., due to the fact that the Nejd tribes, as a result of the reinforced blockade measures of Saudiyeh Government were able to have very little sea intercourse with Kuwait,, during the period under report. Pearls of the aggrer, gate amount of Rs. 3,64,000 are shown in the tables as having been exported for sale to Indian markets, but accurate figures of these as well as of specie can, as mentioned elsewhere, never be obtained, as both are nearly always carried away amongst personal luggage. Of the total export trade 52-2 per cent, was with India, 22-9 per cent, with Arab Qoast, 21-7 per cent, with Iraq, 2-2 per cent, with the Persian Coast, and 1 per cent, with other countries. 14. Rainfall .—The total rainfall during the year under report was 9-93 inches, a record year, and was distributed as follows :— April, 1934 Inches. . -54 May, 1934 . •41 November, 1934 •24 December, 1934. . 516 January, 1935 . •77 February, 1935 . . 2-60 March, 1935 •21 ' 15. Public Health .—During the year there were no epidemics. The health of the town on the whole was good, but Tuberculosis and Abdominal Com plaints took their usual toll, the latter especially among infants. Ear and eye diseases being as common as previous years.2 PART II. (A) Trade. General Conditiom.-At the present time Knwait ,» passing through a stage of trans,tu,n from a Bedouin to a more or less modern town. Beople wants are definitely increasing and in character. The change has been all the more rapid since the opening up of the overland route to Trau Similarly the advent of Imperial Airways on the Arab side of the Gulf and th efac tthat Kuwart has become a regular port of call for the East and Westbound aircraft, have also had a considerable civilising effect on the Kuwait population as a *hole. 2. Kuwait, which grows neither wheat, barley, rice, dates, the staple food needs of the Ar a b, pro duces nothing to meet her own needs : for all her requirements she depends on foreign countries. India supplies Kuwait with most of her f oodstl ^ s ’ ie rice sugar, tea, flour, etc. ; Japan with piece goods, hardware and a large variety of miscellaneous articles, etc.; and Iraq with wheat, barley dates, tobacco, cigarettes, articles of earthenware^, etc. 3. In addition to the requirements of the popula tion of the town itself estimated to be some 60 000 souls, and of her nomad tribes numbering about 20 000 Kuwait imports large quantities of food stuffs which find their way into the territories of neighbouring States and help to support the grea Bedomn tribes of North East Arabia and of he Southern desert of Iraq. This fact coupled to the advantage of possessing a fine natural harbour (one of the best in the Gulf) makes Kuwait an important trade centre on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. 4 New Items of Trade.-The chief new item of : trade is that in electric goods. An electric plant has recently been installed m the Tovn. The venture seems so far to be a definite success, an the number of houses which are being mstaHed with electric light shows a steady increase. There should be therefore a good demand in the future for all / sorts' of electric apparatus and accessories. The current supplied is D. C. and the voltage 220, 5. Other articles are :— ( a ) Cycles and Motor Cycles, (b) Canvas and leather shoes, (c) Cutlery, (d) Shirting Cloth, etc. 6 Growth of Foreign Competition.—Ol late years, foreign competition has grown to a formidable extent in the Kuwait market. The latest and most formidable entrant in the field being Japan Italian, German and Russian goods have in turn had their \ day and practically disappeared. At V v f? nt \ Japanese goods alone preponderate over all others t in the local bazaars. ' 7. The Russians.—A couple of years ago Russia occupied the same relative position as Japan does to-day as the chief exporter of manufactured goods, into Kuwait. Russian matches, piece goods, etc., had flooded the market when they first marie them had nooae B ut smC e the advenl^fr JapaneTMods, the Russian trade has rapifT diminished 8 until at the present moment it can be said for practical purposes to have ceased to exis . As regards the prices of the goods exported by the two countries mentioned there was practically no difference So the overwhelming success of the Japanese can only be ascribed to the supenonty of their trading methods. 8 Japanese .—Japanese goods continue to retain their popularity almost to the exc usion of those of all other nationalities. The quality of most of their goods is inferior and often bad but they possess the all important advantage of extreme cheapness. The majority of the inhabitants of Kuwait earn little more than suffices to eke out a bare existence To be readily saleable therefore everything must be of the lowest possible price whatever its quality or lasting properties may be. 9 Japanese Methods.— Japanese seem to have made itTpoint of thoroughly studying their markets before sending goods. They often send their travel ling agents to observe minutely the tastes and peculiar needs of the people of the particular place to which they want to send their goods. One of the biggest Japanese firms, has recently appointed a local Persian,as their agent for Kuwait. Most of the trade wfoch Japan is done through agents in Bombay or Karachi and only a small amount is done direct. Japanese steamers have since 1934 started com ing to the Persian Gulf. The first Japanese steamer to visit Kuwait was S. S. Yoshida Maru, called here on 11th January 1934 She landed 5005 bags of Japanese cement, which was sold at a wholesale rate of Rs. 20 per 20 bags and at a retail rate of Rs. 1-4 per bag, as against Rs. 2 per bag of Portland cement. The Master of the above steamer came ashore and saw several of the well known merchants of the town and generally went out of his way to make himself pleasant. His general bearing and nice manners on shore made an excellent impression. 10. To sum up, Japanese goods with the exception of a few items, are at present at the climax of popu larity in the local market, though there is a small section of well-to-do class of people with whom the term “Japanese” has come to be, after personal experience, a synonym for inferior quality. Al though the number of such people is inconsiderable, yet the very fact of their showing a tendency to prefer British or the United States goods instead of Japanese is significant and can perhaps be takenI to mean that given added purchasing power, the S average Kuwaiti is capable of appreciating quality and real value as opposed to mere first cost. 11. The exceptions referred to in the first sentence of above paragraph are :— Japanese Bicycles and (6) Matches. ' Japanese 22 Cycles have failed altogether in the\ Kuwait market and this has resulted in an increased \ demand for British manufactured machines. The | ‘‘ Appollo ” make Cycles are particularly popular, f 12. Suggestions for Meeting Competition — (a) Direct Contact Through Travelling Agents .— The value of direct and personal contact with local merchants of this place with a view to obtaining first hand knowledge as to the peculiar needs of Kuwait market cannot be overemphasized. An article which is originally manufactured for Western markets has, of course, to undergo considerable alterations and modifications before it is suitable to be put on the local market, since conditions in this part of the world are materially different from those prevailing in the West. The despatch of commercial travellers to Kuwait, as is done by the Japanese at present, should no longer be found difficult, in view of the service now maintained by Imperial Airways down the Arab side of the Gulf. (b) Appointment of Kuwaitis as Agents for Kuwait. —At present it would appear that British manufac turers invariably appoint Basra merchants as their sole Agents for the whole of Persian Gulf. These Agents charge full commission on duty, while local prospective agents who could sell all classes of goods cheaper and could popularize and push trade owing to the low duty at Kuwait (4| per cent.) if they were given agencies, are shut out, because as sub-agents any remuneration they make is too little. (c) Quotation of prices in Rupee as well as Ster ling. —This would help a good deal since local merchants have no means of keeping in touch with the fluctuating rates of exchange. The result is— not infrequently to the detriment of British manu facture—that misleading calculations in terms of Rupee of priced quoted in Sterling are frequently made. (B) Financial. 13. The question will be dealt with as a whole, rather than on the lines suggested in the ques tionnaire, under this head. 14. There are no banks in Kuwait and transfers of money to foreign countries are either made by means of International Money Order through the Post Office or through Banks in Basra. This total absence of exchange facilities is a great drawback and a considerable handicap in the conduct of quick business transactions. The reason for the absence of banks is three fold :— (a) Inadequate volume of trade, (b) Religious prejudice of people against charg ing interest on capital, and (c) Owners’ reluctance to entrust money out of their own hands. 15. Apropos of (c) above : people of Kuwait, nut unlike those of so many other backward countries, are in the habit of hoarding money to a very large extent. The case may here be cited of a typical Kuwaiti capitalist, who made a fortune in the pearl trade and who is by far the richest man in Kuwait. It is said that he still keeps all his cash in an under ground cellar, takes a periodical check of his money (silver) by weighing it, and on finding it correct locks the cellar again till the next check falls due. 16. The same attitude applies to smaller monev holders who appear to feel more at ease with thciV money under lock and key or buried underground than when it is invested in some w r ay. 17. This attitude of capitalists, both large and small, has undoubtedly an adverse effect on the money market. It tends to an unnecessary with drawal of money from circulation and ultimately results in contraction of currency and tightness of money. (C) Taxation. 18. An indirect tax in the form of a duty of 41 per cent, ad valorem is levied on imports into Kuwait. This bears very lightly on people and its effect on purchasing power of the consumer is insignificant. Under agreement with His Majesty’s Government articles imported by British subjects pay only 4 per cent. duty. (D) Military. 19. Commandeering 'J The questions do not arise of Transport. Effects I since Kuwait Military of Conscription. j system is that of a tribal J type. (E) Agriculture. 20. As stated above, neither Kuwait nor its environments can boast of any agricultural resources. There are no date plantations of any value, no fields and not many kitchen gardens. The villages to the South-east of Kuwait supply a limited but increasing quantity of vegetables and melons. The agricul tural centre in the principality is Jaharah (situated some 25 miles south-west of Kuwait) which has greatly improved during the year owing to the facilities afforded by motor transport in taking the products into town. The village has over 2,500 date trees, under which wheat, barley and luqri&amp;e,4 melons, water melons, pumpkins beans and some other vegetables are grown in increasing quantities. The above crops are mostly irrigated but a small amount of wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone. The agriculture of Jaharah might be considerably in creased if more money were sunk in it. The second most important agricultural centre is the island of Falaikah where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches: the island also produces vegetables especially carrots which are of an exceptionally fine quality but the agriculture is generally inferior to that of Jaharah. 21. As will be seen from what has been said above, from an agricultural point of view the value of land in Kuwait is very little. Except in case of land surrounding the Town, which can be useful for building purposes, land is free and everybody is at liberty to take up any unoccupied piece and develop it. The Kuwait Government keeps no records of land holdings, nor is any land revenue charged to the cultivator. Except, therefore, for a few of the tracts of land in the environs of the Town, which are held by private owuers and which change hands as any other property does, land is not hypothecated. (F) Industry. 22. General .—As has been already stated Kuwait has no industries worth the name, of her own. The reasons for this state of affairs are as under :— (a) Shyness of Capital (See remarks under head Financial, page 8) and lack of enterprise among local people. (b) Limited and uncertain market. (c) Influx of cheap Japanese goods as a result of low customs duty, which tends to kill industrial initiative. 23. The only manufactures of which Kuwait can boast are as follows :— (a) A cloth called “ Darry Basht ”, which is manufactured as a cottage industry by a primitive type of handloom and is ex clusively used for making “ Bisht ” or Arab cloaks (known also as Abbas). This cloth is woven from sheep’s wool and the thread is spun locally by poor classes of Arabs as a sort of spare time job. It is usually available in lengths of 6 to 6i yards, which cost on an average from £0-10-8 to £0-13-4 a piece. A roll or piece, sufficient for one cloak, takes from 4 to 10 days to weave. (b) Kuwait is well known over the whole of the Persian Gulf for boat (sailing) building. Figures regarding number and tonnage of boats built during the year under report appear on page 1 of Part I of this Report. 0^ (c) Fish Oil, boat sails, ropes, etc., etc., are also manufactured for local use. 24. New Industries Introduced. —Nil. 25. Government Encouragement. —Nil. 26. Use of Electricity in Industry. —In view of the extremely backward state of industry the use of electricity in manufacture is unknown, and is hardly likely to develop for some years at least if ever. 27. Demand for Foreign Machinery. —Demand for foreign machinery is insignificant. The only machi nery used is in motor boats and launches of which about a dozen exist at Kuwait. 28. Development of Mines. —Kuwait is very poor in mineral resources. The only mineral product is gypsum mortar, which is manufactured by the simple process of firing rubbish in broad shallow excavations. There is a large gypsiferous tract on the out-skirts of Kuwait Town and it is found in several other parts of the Principality. Oil indications in the shape of a number of bitu men and oil seepages exist in the hinterland, and it is hoped that the Kuwait Oil Company (which was granted a concession in December 1934) will shortly commence drilling operations. (G) Communications and Transport. 29. General. —As mentioned elsewhere the chief means of transport between Kuwait and other ports of the Persian Gulf is by the local dhows engaged in oversea trade carrying, as distinguished from pearl fishing, etc., or by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company, which call regularly every week. Besides the above and a motor road between Kuwait and Basra there are no regular roads con necting Kuwait with the hinterland and Saudi Arabia. This is due to the fact that the interior though it consists of flat and generally hard desert which can be traversed in nearly every direction by motor cars, is not at all an easy country to travel in. The great obstacle is complete lack of supplies and extreme scarcity of water. The only regular means of transport is by camel along definite routes. 30. Advent of the Motor Car. —In view of the un developed state of the hinterland it has not hitherto been found either convenient or profitable to employ motor as a means of transport. The motor service between Kuwait and Basra carries passengers onlyVI I' i i Camel, therefore, as already stated, still remains the chief and indispensable means of transport. 31. Air Service .—Both East and Westbound ser vices of the Imperial Airways have been regularly cal^Mi at Kuwait every week ever since the Com parerame over to the Arab side in 1932. Hitherto the Company has restricted its activities to carrying of mails only as distinguished from com mercial freight, as far as Kuwait is concerned. 32. Security.—The Kuwait-Basra route is quite safe, but perhaps same cannot be said of minor routes between Kuwait and the hinterland. This is because of the desert nature of the country, occupied only by nomad tribes, who are not above occasionally raiding a caravan carrying merchandise, etc., should the local Powers that be for a moment show carelessness or get slack. (H) Social. 33. Standard of Living.—The majority of Kuwait population are poor and about 10,000 souls (out of a total of approximately 60,000) have to eke out an existence on little more than one anna a day each, while most of the Bedouin population subsist on camel’s milk arid dates. The standard of living is thus seen to be low but the people on the whole are happy and appear content enough with their lot. The cost of living is cheap. A quarter of an anna will buy a large loaf of bread while Japan supplies the wherewithal to clothe a man at amaz ingly low prices. 34. Employment. —Pearl fishing is the chief in dustry of the inhabitants of the town. Apart from some 2,000 persons engaged in business and other minor occupations, the rest of the population depend for their livelihood on pearl fishing directly or in directly. The Pearl season starts about the end of May and continues for the best part of the Summer. The Kuwait pearling fleet consists of 700 boats but only 200 to 300 boats put to sea in recent years. The Pearl trade absorbs about 6 to 7 thousand men in various capacities, viz., Nakhudas of boats, divers and haulers. An additional one thousand persons find employ ment in subsidiary trades like manufacture of boat sails, ropes, fish oil, etc. Since, as mentioned above the pearl season lasts only for about five months in the year, divers and others have to look for employment in other direc tions for the remainder of the time. About half of them take to sea, fishing, wood cutting, etc., the rest becoming coolies and engaging in petty trading or going out into the desert with camels and sheep. Like all other countries Kuwait has her unemploy ed numbering about 5,000, who live on their relatives. For prices of various tvpes of labour see page 1 (Part I). 35. Evidence of Emigration .—In spite of the poverty and lack of sufficient employment, which have been aggravated by the depressed condition of the pearl trade during the past few years, there is no tendency to emigrate among the people of Kuwait. On the other hand there is a considerable number of Persian, Iraqi and Nejdi immigrants who have in the recent past taken up residence in Kuwait. 36. Municipal Services. —Kuwait is believed to be the cleanest and also perhaps the healthiest town in the Persian Gulf. This is partly due to the dry and wholesome climate of the place and partly to the efficient municipal services. During the past few years most of the narrow and overcrowded bazaars of the town have been widened and otherwise improved by the Municipality. His Excellency the Ruler himself takes a keen interest in the sanitation and general welfare of his people. List of Prominent Merchants. - Name. Line. 1. Messrs. Jashanmal &amp; Sons (Kuwait). 2.

(1st April 1932 to 31st March 1933.) BY Lieutenant-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait- General. (а) The Principality of Kuwait. —Kuwait is an Independent Arab State in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. It has a distinc tive flag of its own : red with word “ Kuwait ” in Arabic characters written in white across it. On the Ruler’s own flag are also written the words vertically and close to the flagstaff side of the flag “ There is no God but God and Mohamed is His Prophet ”. (б) The Frontier. —The frontier line of Kuwait is as follows :— Starting from the Southern portion of Ras al Qulai’ah (42 miles from Kuwait), with the Town (Political Agency) as centre, it describes an arc towards the West until it intersects 29° latitude, and from this point runs in a straight line to the Batin valley (near Rigai), opposite the junction of the Wadi al-Aujah with the Batin. The line then runs Northward along the centre line of the bed of the Batin valley to a point just South of the latitude of Safwan, then Eastward, passing imme diately South of Jabal Sanam, Safwan and Um Qaar, and so on to the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khaur ’Abdullah. The territory enclosed within this line and the Persian Gulf, together with the island of Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakah, ’Auhah, Kubbar, Karu and Umm Al-Maradim, is recognised as belonging to Kuwait, as are also the waters of the Khor ’Abdullah South and West of a line drawn down the centre of the estuary from its junction with the Khor Zubair to the open sea. (c) Kuwait Neutral Area. —The tract of country bounded on the North by the Southern portion of the Kuwait frontier as described above, on the East by sea, and the West by the Shaqq and on the South by the straight line running due East from the Shaqq through ’Ain al ’Abd to the sea North of Ras al Mish’ab, is recognised as common to the two States of Nejd and Kuwait, in which both enjoy equal rights. (d) Population. —The Capital itself has a popula tion of about 60,000 souls of whom the greatest majority are Arabs. The Persian community, however, has greatly increased in recent years and now consists of about 10,000 souls. There are over 5,000 Negroes, some 300 Iraqis and a few Jews. There are also about a dozen Indians mostly engaged in the tailoring trade. Outside the Capital the inhabitants of the principality are all Arabs and are nomads. At a rough estimate these number about 10,000 souls. The only settled villages are Jahrah, at the head of the Kuwait bay, which has a population of about 1,000 souls: Falikah village, on the island of the same name at the entrance of the Kuwait bay with a similar popula tion and the smaller villages of Hawaii, Dimnah, Fantas, Abu Hulaifah, Fuhaihil and Shu’aibah to the South and South-East of Kuwait. (e) The Town of Kuwait. —The Town now mea sures about 3£ miles along the shore, having extend ed considerably in recent years towards the East. Its greatest depth, about a mile and a quarter, is near the centre of the Town, where the long suburb called Murqab has grown out from it towards the South. The streets are irregular and winding and the Town is not laid out on any general plan. Most of the houses have only a ground floor, but appear higher owing to a parapet wall enclosing the roof. There are over 40 Mosques, of which nine are Friday Congregational Mosques. None of them have anv architectural merit and follow closely the severe and simple style of those found in Nejd and the Wahabi Capital of Riyadh ; Mosque minarets from which the Faithful are called to prayer are of the squat square type and do not overlook the neigh bouring houses. In the year 1920, the existing Town Wall was built by the late Shaikh Salim al Mubarak As- Subah. It is about 4£ miles in length and has three gates. In addition to the gates which are protected by towers, there is a bastion every 200 yards throughout the length of the wall. At its base the wall is some 13 feet broad but tapers to 3 feet at the top. Its height is about 16 feet between towers. (/) Education.—-Thzre are a great many schools of a sort in Kuwait. The Arabs conduct at leastI € 52, the Persians have 11 and the Jews and Chris tians one each making a total of 65. Of the Arab schools 27 are for boys and 25 for girls. These schools are not under any control of the local Gov ernment. The curriculum in most of the schools consists of reading and memorising the Quran. The American Mission School gives the best educa tion in Kuwait, but its members do not exceed 27. English is one of the principal subjects taught. (g) Administration. —Kuwait was founded about the beginning of the 18th century by some settlers of the ‘ Utub ’, a sect of the Anazzah tribe, over whom the Subah family enjoyed predominance. It is unnecessary to consider the early history. Suffice to say that in May 1896 Shaikh Mubarak became Euler of Kuwait on the assasination of his brother. It was he who raised Kuwait from a place of little importance to a flourishing principality. Under his strong rule it became a most attractive place to live in to the Arab mind and the population of the Town nearly doubled itself. The present Shaikh like his predecessors' rules personally and as far as possible avoids delegation of his authority* He however has a Qadhi or Chief Judge who tries all criminal cases as well as those connected with marriage, divorce and inheritance and a deputy in the shape of Shaikh Abdullah al-Jabir, a relative who deals with all tribal cases outside the town and petty magisterial cases in the City. The Euler himself gives audience to all and sundry for one or two hours daily in the market place and there decides important cases and appeals by direct judgment. Should a commercial dispute come before him, he refers it for enquiry and decision to a Standing Council of leading merchants. Currency .—Kuwait has no Currency of its own. Indian rupees and smaller coins are used in the town and accounts are kept in the Indian Currency but Maria Theresa Dollars are used for all dealings with the desert. The value of Maria Theresa Dollars averaged Rs. 80^6-6 per 100 Dollars during the period under review. N.B .—The average local Rupee-Sterling exchange during the period under review was Rs. 18-5-3 per pound. Weights cmd Measures :—The ordinary unit of weight is the waqiyah of which there are three kinds: one of 4 lbs. 10’22. oz., another of 4 lbs. 15-168 oz. and a third of 9 lbs. 4*44 oz. being respec tively the weight of 75, 80 and 150 Maria. Theresa Dollars on which coin the waqiyah is based. The waqiyah of 4 lbs. 15'168 oz. is only used by the local Customs for imports from the desert and that qf 9 lbs. 4- 44 oz. only for the sale of fish and beyond this mention of them no further notice will be taken of them here. The waqiyah of 4 lbs. 10-22 oz. is used by the local Customs for the sea imports and is universally used in the town. A larger weight is the Mann of which there are five distinct varieties, all based on the waqiyah of 4 lbs. 10-22 oz., viz. :— (1) The Mann of 27 waqiyahs, or 125 lbs. 3-94 oz. is the local Customs measure - for weighing goods for assessment of duty. It is also used in the town for weighing all commodities for which there is not a special measure. (2) The Mann of 30 waqiyahs or 139 lbs. 3-94 oz. is used for wheat, barley, Iraq rice and firewood. (3) The Mann of 12 w-aqiyahs or 55 lbs. 10-64 oz. is used for sail cloth only. (4) The Mann of 24 waqiyahs or 111 lbs. 5-28 oz. is used for clarified butter, fat, salt, and gypsum mortar. (5) The Mann of 36 waqiyahs or 166 lbs. 15-92 oz. is used for wheat and barley when imported from Basrah. 20 Manns of the last-named variety or approximately 3,340 lbs. make one Taqar. Firewood is normally sold by the Rafa of 4 Manns of 30 waqiyahs or 556 lbs. 10-4 oz. Gypsum mortar is sold by the Karah of 100 Manns of 24 waqi^abs or 11,135 lbs. The term Karah is also used for date palm branches in which sense it means 1,000 branches. Beams and masts are sold by the Calicut Kandy or 10 cubic feet 29 cubic inches. Round rafters or spars by the Korjah or score and boat ribs by the Gari or cart-load of 40 pieces or upward according to size. The 4-gallon kerosene oil tin is used as a measure of capacity for the sale of water. Of the smaller weights is the habbah equivalent to 3 grains Troy used in the sale of gold and silver. Gold is normally sold by the mithqal, ’attari of 18 habbahs or 54 grains and also by the Turkish pound and fractions thereof. Silver is sold by the mithqal Shirazzi of 24 habbahs or 72 grains. The mithqal Attari and the mithqal Shirazzi are also used for drugs and silk thread but for this purpose they are not divided into habbahs but only into halves and quarters, the nice ties of weight being arrived at using the two mithqals and their fractions in con junction. Perfumes as also gold thread are sold by the tolah of 180 grains. In the pearl trade the following weights and measures are most commonly used in Kuwait. Wholesale purchase of pearls from the Captains of the pearling boats are made chiefly by size. For this purpose after any exceptionally good pearls which it is desirous to dispose of separately have been removed remainder ar6 assorted by being pass ed through a series of perforated brass or copper bowls, the standard set of which consists of four :3 • the perforations of the largest called ras are -la' in diameter, those of the second batn - IS', those of the third dhail *13 aaid those of the fourth rabi’ah •11'. After being assorted into ras, batn, etc., they change hands at a previously arranged rate at so much the mithqal ’Arabi which is equivalent to 50 grains. The ordinary pearls then usually pass one dealer to another on the more precise of estimate based upon weight. In Kuwait the Bombay mithqal equivalent to 75 grains Troy and sub-divided into 24 rattes each of 15 anahs is usually employed. The unit in the dealers’ system is called a chau and although derived from a weight it is not in itself a weight. The number of chaus in a pearl is found by squaring the weight of the pearl in mithqals and multiplying the result by 330. The chau is divisible into 100 dukras and the dukra into 100 badams. There are other kinds of chaus also occasionally used, and obtained by an identical process from other mithqals such as the Poona mithqal of 68 grains. The normal unit of length is the dhira or cubit of 19 inches but for rope which is also sold by the weight, the ba or fathom is usually employed. There is no square measure in use, and a plot of ground is described as being so many dhiras according to the sum of its sides. The Year 1932-33. The year under review was again not a favourable one for trade, although it showed an improvement on the immediately preceding 12 months. This must be put down to world depression, and the fact that there was practically no trade with Nejd. The Pearl “ Catch ” on the whole was again not good t and the pearl market remained so low that good pearls could be purchased for 50 per cent, less than previous years. It was however expected that with the advent of some of the well-known European pearl merchants that the local market would improve and prices of pearls would rise, but unfortunately no tangible increase took place and the financial condition of the pearl merchants remained so acute that although they had safes full of pearls most of the merchants were not only unable to pay their large debts but were not in a position to pay even the small wages due to the pearling crew. Accord ing to the Customs export figures some Rs. 4,50,000 worth of pearls were estimated to have been export ed for sale in India and elsewhere. But this figure as explained under ^ Exports ” cannot be relied on in any way. Imports. The total imports by sea amounted to Rs. 31,14,689, which showed an increase of 2-1 per cent, compared with the figures for 1931-32. This small, though very gratifying increase may be put down, to recovery in world trade, and in spite the fact that during the year His Majesty Ki n g Abdul Aziz al Baud, Ruler of Nejd and Hejaz, con tinued to observe his strict blockade against trade from Kuwait with the hinterland. Of the total import trade 57*7 per cent, was with India, 22-2 per cent, with ’Iraq, 7*1 per cent, with Persian Coast, 2*8 per cent, with Arabian Coast and 10-2 per cent, with other countries. Exports. The total exports by sea amounted to Rs. 11,11,881 and showed a decrease of 30*3 per cent, compared with the figures for 1931-32. This is accounted for by the known decreased, export in hides, ghi, sheep skins, wool, specie and horses, due to the fact that Nejd tribes were forbidden to have intercourse with Kuwait. Pearls of the aggregate amount of Rs. 4,50,000 are shown in the tables as having been exported for sale to Indian markets, but accurate figures of these as well as of specie can, as mention ed elsewhere, never be obtained, as both are nearly always carried away amongst personal luggage. Of the total export trade 55*3 per cent, was with India, 18-7 per cent, with Arab Coast, 22*1 per cent, with ’Iraq and 3-9 per cent, with the Persian Coast. Pearl Fishing. This is the most important trade of Kuwait. The town possesses over 700 pearl boats but many of these have not been to sea for some time due to the depressed state of the pearl trade. The average number of boats which of recent years visited the banks is not more than 350 and this figure has de creased as the market was no better than last year. The Kuwait pearling fleet consists of two parts, the very small boats which fish close in shore off the Neutral Zone, Sudah and Huzaim areas to the South of Kuwait, and the larger boats with 8 to 10 “ sweeps ” on either side, which go further afield and join up with the Bahrain and Qatar fleets. The latter which may be called the Kuwait main pearling fleet works under the eye of an Amir al Bahar, or Admiral and no boat is allowed to return home without his sanction. The “ Rukbah ” is the name given to the commencement of the Pearl Season and the “ Gufful ” to the end when all boats return home. The season falls somewhere between 15th May and 15th September. Customs Administration and Lighterage. The administration of the Kuwait Customs is supervised by a local Arab and the system works 1 satisfactorily. An import duty on goods arriving by sea, of 4£ per cent., ad valorem is charged and a land export duty of 2 per cent, on goods taken out by Bedouin. There is no sea export duty except on goods brought in from the interior such as clari fied butter, hides, wool, etc , on which 4 per cent, is charged if exported.4 r Freight, Shipping and Navigation. Kuwait owns about 291 large sailing vessel 3 engaged in the oversea carrying trade as distinct from pearling and fishing boats. These include 80 having a capacity of over 300 tons, 21 of over 230 tons and 67 of 100 tons. Forty-eight boats were employed constantly in bringing drinking water to the town from Shaft al Arab, On an average 8 such boats arrive daily bringing 80,000 gallons of water (worth Rs. 465) to the town. The British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, main tain a weekly mail service from India and a fort nightly service to India. The steamers owned and chartered by (1) The Hansa Steamship Company of Bremen, Germany, and (2) The Strick and Eller- man Lines of London also called during the year under report but their service has not been a regular one. The rate of freight by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers was Rs. 11-8-0 from Bombay or Karachi to Kuwait, and from Kuwait to Bombay or Karachi was Rs. 11-8-0 per ton respectively throughout the year. Communication. Kuwait possesses a combined Post and Telegraph Office worked by the Post and Telegraph Depart ment of the Iraq Government. Foreign rates of postage and telegram charges are applicable from Kuwait to the United Kingdom and other countries. Mails and parcels for the United Kingdom and the Continent are despatched from Kuwait by car and connect with the overland route (Baghdad and Haifa), taking 10 days to reach London on an average. The C. O. D. and Insurance systems are available in Kuwait. Imperial Airways machines began calling at Kuwait with effect from the 22nd December 1932. At first as a preliminary measure the arrangement was only for six months ; but on the expiry of that period the management of the Company decided to make Kuwait a permanent port of call. This has resulted in widespread and genuine satisfaction. Letters can now be posted and replies received within a fortnight from Europe and within a week from India. The Kuwait Motor Transport Cdmpany which is also under a Postal contract with the Iraq Post and Telegraph Department for the conveyance of both fast sea mails to and from India via Basra and overland mails from Europe via Iraq and vice versa, continued to function between Kuwait and Zubair and maintained the road in good condition. The fare by the Company’s motors is Rs. 6-4-0 per seat and the journey each way on an average occupies four hours. Sea Fisheries. The only truly local produce of Kuwait is that yielded by the harbour fisheries which are a valu able asset. Besides boat weight-nets and lines, traps or tidal weirs constructed of reed hurdles are also employed : the fish enter them with the inflowing tide and are left behind at the ebb. The majority of the fish caught is consumed locally ; but a small proportion is dried and exported to Basra, the Shatt al Arab villages and Hassa ports. Boat Building. Four boats of an aggregate value of Rs. 35,000 were built in Kuwait during the year under review. Of these one had a carrying capacity of 170 tons. These figures are not included in the Trade Report, Many smaller rowing boats w^ere also built which it is unnecessary to enumerate. Labour. The price of labour remained nearly the same as for the previous year. An unskilled labourer earn ed from Rupee 1 to Rs. 1-8-0, a carpenter from Rs. 2-8-0 to Rs. 3-8-0 and a boat builder from Rs. 2-8-0 to Rs. 3-8-0 per diem. Minerals. The only mineral product worked is gypsum mortar, which is manufactured by the simple pro cess of firing rubbish in broad shallow excavations. There is a large gypsiferous tract on the outskirts of Kuwait Town and it is found in several other parts of the principality. Oil indications in the shape of a number of bitu men and oil surface springs exist in the hinterland but whether these can be worked commercially has yet to be seen. Domestic Animals. The most valuable domestic animals are camels and sheep, of which there are large numbers among the Bedouin. Large numbers of goats and donkeys are also found in the town, the latter being of the large white breed originally from Hassa. These are sometimes over 13 hands in height and a good one will cost about Rs. 60. There are also some horses mostly owned by the Ruler, and a few horn ed cattle, Agriculture. Neither Kuwait nor its environments ean boast of any agricultural resources, There are no date plantations of any value, no fields and not many kitchen gardens. The villages to the South-East of Kuwait supply a limited but increasing quantity 6f vegetables and melons. The agricultural centre in the principality is Jahrah which has greatly im proved during the year owing to the facilities afford ed by motor transport in taking the products into5 town. The village has over 2,500 date trees, under which wheat, barley and lucerne, melons, water melons, pumpkins, beans and some other vegetables are grown in increasing quantities. The above crops are mostly irrigated but a small amount of wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone. The agriculture of Jahrah might be considerably in- cx^pd if more money were sunk in it. The second mSt important agricultural centre is the island of Falaikah where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches ; the island also produces vegetables, especially carrots which are of an exceptionally fine quality, but the agriculture is generally inferior to that of Jahrah. Rainfall. The total rainfall during the year under report was 5*39 inches and was distributed as follows :— May 1932 . Inches. •40 December 1932 . •51 January 1933 . 2-68 February 1933 . MO March 1933 . . •70 Public Health. From July to December there was very severe Epidemic of Small-pox with a high death rate. Vaccination was carried out on a large scale, more or less forcibly. But owing to the people having an objection to being vaccinated during an epidemic, the disease lasted a longer time than it should have. Besides the above, general health of the Town was good. Tuberculosis and diseases of children took their usual toll, while other diseases were those con nected with eyes, ears and stomach. Municipality. Kuwait Town possesses a vigorous Municipal Secretary and Committee, who, throughout the year under review, took great pains with the cleanli ness of the streets, and public sanitation generally. Among the improvements effected were the re- roofing of several of the smaller bazaars, and the widening of certain narrow streets to allow of motor car traffic to pass. The chief improvement however has been the giving of a contract to a Baghdad firm for the elec trification of the Town. Though the work of erect ing poles and wires has been very slow the year 1934 promises to see electricity definitely introduced. Exchange. . Months. # Bate PER 100 Maria Theresa Dollars. Sovereign.

(1st April 1931 to 31st March 1932.) BY Lieutenant-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, Political Agent, Kuwait. General. (a) The Principality of Kuwait.—Kxma.it is an Independent Arab State in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. It has a distinc-] tive flag of its own : red with word “ Kuwait ” ini Arabic characters written in white across it. I On the Ruler’s own flag are also written the* words vertically and close to the flagstaff side of the flag “ There is no God but God and Mohamed is His Prophet.” (h) The Frontier. —The frontier line of Kuwait is as follows Starting from the Southern portion of Ras al- Qulai’ah (42 miles from Kuwait), with the Town (Political Agency) as centre it describes an arc towards the West until it intersects 29° latitude, and from this point runs in a straight line to the Batin valley, (near Rigai) opposite the junction of the Wadi al-Aujah with the Batin. The line then runs Northward along the Batin valley to a point just South of the latitude of Safwan, then East ward, passing immediately South of Jabal Sanam, Safwan and Um Qasr, and so on to the unction of the Kuwait with the Khaur ’Abdullah. The terri tory enclosed within this line and the Persian Gulf, together with the island of Warbah, Bubiyah! Maskan, hallakah, Auhah, Kubbar and Umm Al-Maradim, is recognised as belonging to Kuwait. (c) Kuwait Neutral Area.—The tract of country bounded on the Jsorth by the Southern portion of the Kuwait frontier as described above, on the East by sea, and the West by the Shaqq and on the South by the straight line running due East from the Shaqq through ’Ain al ’Abd to the sea North of Ras al Mish’ab, is recognised as common to the two States of Nejd and Kuwait, in which both enjoy equal rights. (d) Population. The Capital itself has a popula tion of about 60,000 souls of whom the greatest majority are Arabs. The Persian community, however, has greatly increased in recent years and now consists of about 10,000 souls. There are over 5,000 negroes, some 300 Iraqis and a few Jews. There are also about a dozen Indians mostly engaged in the tailoring trade. Outside the Capital the in habitants of the principality are all Arabs and are nomads. At a rough estimate these number about 10,000 souls. The only settled villages are Jahrah, at the head of the Kuwait bay, which has a popula tion of about 1,000 souls; Falikah village, on the island of the same name at the entrance of the Kuwait bay with a similar population and the smaller villages of Hawaii, Dimnah, Fantas, Abu Hulaifah, Fuhaihil and Shu’aibah to the South and South-East of Kuwait. (e) The Town of Kuwait. —The Town now measures about 3| miles along the shore, having extended considerably in recent years towards the East. Its greatest depth, about a mile and a quarter, is near the centre of the Town, where the long suburb called Murqab has grown out from it towards the South-East. The streets are irregular and winding and the Town is not laid out on any general plan. Most of the houses have only a ground floor, but appear higher owing to a parapet wall enclosing the roof. There are over 40 Mosques, of which nine are Friday Congregational Mosques. None of them have any architectural merit and follow closely the severe and simple style of those found in Nejad and the \Ya,habi Capital of Riyadh ; Mosque minarets from which the faithful are called to prayer are ©f the squat square type and do not overlook the neigh bouring houses. In the year 1920, the existing Town Wall was built by the late Shaikh Salim al Mubarrak as- Subah. It is about 4£ miles in length and has three gates. In addition to the gates which are protected by towers, there is a bastion every 200 yards through out the length of the wall. At its base the wall is some 13 feet broad but tapers to 3 feet at the top. Its height is about 16 feet between towers. (/) Education. —There are a great many schools of a sort in Kuwait. The Arabs conduct at least 52, the Persians have 11 and the Jews and Chris tians one each making a total of 65. Of the Arab schools 27 are for boys and 25 for girls. These schools are not under any control of the local govern ment. The curriculum in most of the school*2 consists of reading and memorising the Quran. The American Mission School gives the best educa tion in Kuwait, but its members do not exceed 30. English is one of the principal subjects taught. (g) Administration. —Kuwait was founded about the beginning of the 18th century by some settlers of the ‘ Utub ” a sept of the Anazzah tribe, over whom the Subah family enjoyed predominance. It is unnecessary to consider the early history. Suffice to say that in May 1896 Shaikh Mubarak became Euler of Kuwait on the assassination of his brother. It was he who raised Kuwait from a place of little importance to a flourishing princi pality. Under his strong rule it became a most attractive place to live in to the Arab mind and the population of the Town nearly doubled itself. The present Shaikh like his predecessors rules personally and as far as possible avoids delegation of his autho rity. He however has a Qadhi or Chief Judge who tries all criminal cases as well as those con nected with marriage, divorce and inheritance and a deputy in the shape of Shaikh Abdullah al-Jabir a relative who deals with all tribal cases outside the town and petty magisterial cases in the City. The Euler himself gives audience to all and sundry for one or two hours daily in the market place and there decides important cases and appeals by direct judgment. Should a commercial dispute come before him, he refers it for enquiry and decision to a standing council of leading merchants. Ci/rrewc?/.—Kuwait has no currency of its own. Indian rupees and smaller coins are used in the town and accounts are kept in the Indian Currency but Maria Theresa Dollars are used for all dealings with the desert. The value of Maria Theresa Dollars averaged Ks. 71-10-0 per 100 dollars during the period under review. N.B .—The average local Rupee—Sterling exchange during the period under review was Rs. 13-8-0 per pound. Weights and measures .—The ordinary unit of weight is the waqiyah of which there are three kinds : one of 4 lbs. 10-22 ozs.: another of 4 lbs. 15-168 ozs. and a third of 9 lbs. 4-44 ozs.; being respectively the weight of 75, 80 and 150 Maria Theresa Dollars on which coin the waqiyah is based. The waqiyah of 4 lbs. 15-168 ozs. is only used by the local Customs for imports from the desert and that of 9 lbs. 4-44 ozs. only for the sale of fish and beyond this mention of them no further notice will be taken of them here. The waqiyah of 4 lbs. 10-22 ozs. is used by the local Customs for the sea imports and is universally used in the town. A larger weight is the Mann of which there are five distinct varieties all based on the waqiyah of 4 lbs. 10-22 ozs. viz .:— (1) The Mann of 27 waqiyahs, or 125 lbs. 3-94 ozs. is the local Customs measure for weighing goods for assessment of duty. It is also used in the town for weighing all commodities for which there is not a special measure. (2) The Mann of 30 waqiyahs or 139 lbs. 3-94 ozs. is used for wheat, barley, Iraq rice and firewood. (3) The Mann of 12 waqiyahs or 55 lbs. 10-64 ozs. is Used for sail cloth only. (4) The Mann of 24 waqiyahs or 111 lb|p|;28 ozs. is used for clarified butter, fal^ salt and gypsum mortar. (5) The Mann of 36 waqiyahs or 166 lbs. 15-92 ozs. is used for wheat and barley when imported from Basrah. 20 Manns of the last named variety or approximately 3,340 lbs. make one Taqar. Firewood is normally sold by the Eafa of 4 Manns of 30 waqiyahs of 556 lbs. 10‘4 ozs. Gypsum mortar is sold by the Karah of 100 Manns of 24 waqiyahs or 11,135 lbs. The term Karah is also used for date palm branches in which sense it means 1,000 branches. Beams and masts are sold by the Calicut Kandy or 10 cubic feet 29 cubic inches. Bound rafters or spars by the Korjah or score and boat ribs by the Gari or cart load of 40 pieces or upward according to size. The 4-gallon kerosene oil tin is used as a measure of capacity for the sale of water. Of the smaller weights is the habbah equivalent to 3 grains Troy used in the sale of gold and silver. Gold is normally sold by the mithqal, ’attari of 18 habbahs or 54 grains and also by the Turkish pound and fractions thereof. Silver is sold by the mithqal Shirazzi of 24 habbahs or 72 grains. The mithqal Attari and the mithqal Shirazzi are also used for drugs and silk thread but for this purpose they are not divided into habbahs but only into halves and quarters, the nice ties of weight being arrived at using the two mithqals and their fractions in con junction. Perfumes as also gold thread are sold by the tolah of 180 grains. In the pearl trade the following weights and measures are most commonly used in Kuwait. Wholesale purchase of pearls from the Captains of the pearling boats are made chiefly by size. For this purpose after any exceptionally good pearls which it is desirous to dispose of separately have been removed remainder are assorted by being passed through a series of perforated brass or copper bowls, the standard set of which consists of four ; the per forations of the largest called ras are -18' in dia meter, those of the second batn. -15' those of the third dhail -13' and those of the fourth rabi’ah •11'. After being assorted into ras, batn., etc., they change hands at a previously arranged rate at so much the mithqal ’Arabi which is equivalent to 50 grains. The ordinary pearls then usually3 pass from one dealer to another on the more precise kind of estimate based upon weight. In Kuwait the Bombay mithqal equivalent to 75 grains Troy and sub-divided into 24 rattes each of 15 anahs is usually employed. The unit in the dealers’ system is called a chau and although derived from a weight it is not in itself a weight. The number of chaus in a pearl is found by squaring the weight of tj^ pearl in mithqals and multiplying the result hy ^3. The chau is divisible into 100 dukras and the dukra into 100 badams. There are other kinds of chaus also occasionally used, and obtained by an identical process from other mithqals such as the Poona mithqal of 68 grains. The normal unit of length is the dhira or cubit of 19 inches but for rope which is also sold by the weight, the ba or fathom is usually employed. There is no square measure in use, and a plot of ground is described as being so many dhiras according to the sum of its sides. The Year 1931-32. This year also was not a favourable one for trade and this was mainly due to there being no trade with Nejd. Consequently many petty shopkeepers have left for Bahrain, Jubail and Qatif to seek employment. The Pearl “ Catch ” on the whole was not good and the pearl market remained so low that good pearls could be purchased for 50 per cent, less than previous years. It was however expected that on the advent of some of the well- known pearl merchants that the local market would improve and prices of pearls would rise but unfor tunately no tangible increase took place and the financial condition of the pearl merchants became so acute that although they had safes full of pearls most of the merchants were not only unable to pay their large debts but were not in a position to pay even the small wages due to the pearling crew. According to the Customs export figures some Its. 3,62,000 worth of pearls were estimated to have been exported for sale in India and elsewhere. But this figure as explained under “ Exports ” cannot be relied on in any way. Imports. The total imports by sea amounted to 30,49,898 and showed a decrease of 27-9 per cent, as com pared with the figures for 1930-31. This decrease can be explained by the fact that during the year His Majesty King Abdul Aziz al Saud, Ruler of Nejd and Hejaz, continued to observe his strict blockade against trade from Kuwait with the hinter land, and there was no apparent recovery in world trade. Of the total import trade 53-9 per cent, was with India, 22-1 per cent, with Iraq, 12-7 per cent, with Persian Coast, 3-8 per cent, with Arabian Coast and 7*5 per cent, with other countries. Exports. The total exports by sea amounted to Rs. 15,95,927 and showed a decrease of 45-9 per cent, compared with the figures for 1930-31. This is accounted for by the known decreased export of clarified butter, building materials and pearls. Pearls of the aggre gate amount of Rs. 3,62,000 are also shown in the tables as having been exported for sale to Indian markets, accurate figures of these as well as specie can never be obtained, as both are nearly always carried away amongst personnel luggage. Of the total export trade 55-4 per cent, was with India 27*5 per cent, with Arab Coast, 14 per cent, with Iraq and 3-1 per cent, with Persian Coast. Pearl Fishing. This is the most important trade of Kuwait. The town possesses over 700 pearl boats but many of these have not been to sea for sometime due to the depressed state of the pearl trade. The average number of boats which of recent years visited the banks is not more than 350 and this figure has decreased as the market was worse than last year. The Kuwait fishing fleet consists of two parts the small boats which fish off the Neutral zone, Sudah and Huzum areas to the South of Kuwait and the larger boats with 6 to 8 “ sweeps ” on either side which go further afield and join up with the Bahrain and Qatar fleets. The Kuwait main 'p eai fi n £ fleet works under the eye of an Amir al Bahar, or Admiral and no boat is allowed to return home without sanction. The “ Rukbah ” is the name given to the commencement of the Pearl season and the “ Gufful ” to the end when all boats return home. The season falls somewhere between 15th May and 15th September. Customs administration and Lighterage. The administration of the Kuwait Customs is supervised by a local Arab and the system works satisfactorily. An import duty of 4 per cent, ad valorem is charged and there is no export duty except on goods brought in from the interior such as clarified butter, hides, wool, etc., on which 4 per cent, is charged if exported. Freight, Shipping and Navigation. Kuwait owms about 291 sailing vessels engaged in carrying trade as distinct from pearling and fishing boats. These include 80 having a capacity of over 300 tons, 21 of over 230 tons and 67 of 100 tons. Forty-eight boats were employed constantly in bringing drinking water to the town from Shatt al Arab. On an average 8 such boats arrive daily and bring 80,000 gallons of water (worth Rs. 465) to the town. The British Indian Steam Naviga tion Company, Limited maintain a weekly service4 from India and a fortnightly service to India. The steamers owned and chartered by (1) The Hansa Steamship Company of Bremen, Germany and (2) Th ^ Strick, Ellerman, and Buckni Lines of London also called during the year under report but their service has not been a regular one. The rate of freight by the British India Steam Naviga tion Company’s steamers was Rs. 13 from Bombay and Karachi to Kuwait and from Kuwait to Bombay and Karachi was Rs. 13 per ton, respectively through out the year. Communication. Kuwait possesses a combined Post and Telegraph office worked by the Post and Telegraph Depart ment of the Iraq Government. Foreign rates of postage and telegram charges are applicable from Kuwait to the United Kingdom and other countries. Mails for the United Kingdom and the continent are despatched from Kuwait via the overland route f Baghdad and Haifa) and take 14 days on an average. Letters can also be sent by Air mail from Basrah both to Europe and India. Parcels from the United Kingdom for Kuwait take 3 to 5 weeks by the above- mentioned overland route and the C.O.D. and Insurance system are also available. The Kuwait Motor Transport Company which is also under a Postal contract with the Iraq Post and Telegraph Department for the conveyance of both sea mails from India and overland mails from Basrah and vice versa continued to function between Kuwait and Zubair, and maintained the road in good condition. The fare by the company’s motors is Rs. 6-4-0 per seat and the journey each way on an average occupies four hours. Sea Fisheries. The only truly local produce of Kuwait is that yielded by the harbour fisheries which are a valuable asset. Besides boat and weight-nets and lines traps or tidal weirs constructed of reed hurdles are also employed : the fish enter them with the flowing tide and are left behind at the ebb. The majority of the fish caught is consumed locally, but a small proportion is dried and exported to Basrah and elsewhere. Boat Building. Twenty-seven boats of an aggregate value of Rs. 40,500 were built in Kuwait during the year under review. Of these one had a carrying capacity of 192 tons. These figures are not included in the Trade Report. Many smaller rowing boats were also built which it is unnecessary to enumerate. Labour. The price of labour remained nearly the same as for the previous year. An unskilled labourer earned from Rs. 1-0-0 to Rs. 1-8-0, a carpenter from Rs. 2-8-0 to Rs. 3-8-0 and a boat builder from Rs. 2-8-0 to Rs. 3-8-0 per diem. The only mineral product worked is gypsum mortar, which is manufactured by the simple process of firing rubbish in broad shallow excavations. There is a large gypsiferous tract on the outskirts of Kuwait Town and it is found in several other parts of the principality. Oil indications in the shape of a number of bitumen and oil surface springs exist in the hinterland but whether these can be worked commercially has yet to be seen. Domestic Animals. The most valuable domestic animals are camels of which there are large numbers, sheep, goats and donkeys of the latter many of a large white breed originally from Hassa, are found in the town. These are sometimes over 13 hands in height and a good one will cost about Rs. 60. There are also some horses and a few horned cattle. Agriculture. Neither Kuwait nor its environments can boast of any agricultural resources. There are no date plantations of any value, no fields and not many kitchen gardens. The villages to the south-east of Kuwait supply a limited but increasing quantity of vegetables and melons. The agricultural centre in the principality is Jahrah which has greatly improved during the year owing to the facilities afforded by motor transport in taking the products into town. There are over 2,500 date trees. The staple crops are wheat barley and lucerne, but melons, watermelons, pumkins, beans and some other vegetables are also grown in increasing quan tities. The above crops are mostly irrigated but a small amount of wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone. The agriculture of Jahrah might be considerably increased if more money were sunk in it. The most important agricultural centre is the island of Falaikah where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches also some vegetables especially carrots which are of an exceptionally fine quality but the agricul ture of the island is generally inferior to that of Jahrah.36 TABLE K.

Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuxait. General. (а) The Principality of Kuwait. —Kuwait is an Independent Arab State in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. It has a distinc tive flag of its own : red with the word “ Kuwait ” in Arabic characters written in white across it. On the Ruler’s own flag are also written the words vertically and close to the flagstaff side of the flag There is no God but God and Mohamed is His Prophet.” (б) The Frontier. —The frontier line of Kuwait is as follows :— Starting from the southern portion of Has al- Qulai’ah (42 miles from Kuwait), with the town as centre it describes an arc towards the west until it intersects 29° latitude, and from this point runs in a straight line to the Batin valley, (near Rigai) opposite the junction of the Wadi al-Aujah with the Batin. The line then runs northward along the Batin Valley to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan, then eastward, passing just south of Jabal Sanam, Safwan and Um Qasr, and so on to the junction of the Kuwait with the Khaur ’Ab dullah. The territory enclosed within this line and the Persian Gulf, together with the island of Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakah, ’Auhah, Kubbar and Umm al-Maradim, is recognised as belonging to Kuwait. (c) Kuwait Neutral Area.—The tract of country bounded on the North by the Southern portion of the Kuwait frontier as described above, on the east by the sea, and the west by the Shaqq, and on the south by the straight line running due east from the Shaqq through ’Ain al ’Abd to the sea North of Ras al Mish’ab is recognised as common to the two States of Nejd and Kuwait, in which both enjoy equal rights. (d) Population.—The Capital itself has a popula tion of about 60,000 souls of whom the greatest majority are Arabs. The Persian Community, however, has greatly increased in recent years and now consists of about 10,000 souls. There are over 5,000 negroes, some 300 ’Iraqis and a few jews. There are also about a dozen Indians mostly engaged in the Tailoring Trade. Outside the capital the inhabitants of the principality are all Arabs and are mostly nomads. At a rough estimate these number about 10,000 souls. The only settled villages are Jahrah, at the head of the Kuwait Bay, which has a population of about 1,000 souls : Falikah village, on the island of the same name at the entrance of the Kuwait Bay with a similar population and the smaller villages of Hawaii, Dimnah Fantas, Abu Hulaifah, Fuhaihil and Shu aibah to the South and South-east of Kuwait. (e) The town of Kuwait. —The Town now measures about 3| miles along the shore, having extended considerably in recent years towards the East. Its greatest depth, about a mile and quarter, is near the centre of the Town, where the long suburb called Murqab has grown out from it towards the South-east. The streets are irregular and winding and the town is not laid out on any general plan. Most of the houses have only a ground floor, but appear higher owing to a parapet wall enclosing the roof. There are over 40 mosques, of which nine are Friday Congregational mosques. None of them have any architectural merit and follow closely the severe and simple style of those found in Nejd and the Wahabi Capital of Riath, mosque minarets from which the faithful are called to prayer are of the squat square type and do not overlook the neigh bouring houses. In the year 1920, the existing Town Wall was built by the late Shaikh Salim al-Mubarek as-Subah. It is about 4£ miles in length and has 3 gates. In addition to the gates which are protected by towers, there is a bastion every two hundred yards through out the length of the wall. At its base the wall is some 13 feet broad but tapers to 3 feet at the top. Its height is about 16 feet between towers.2 (/) Education .—There are a great many schools of a sort in Kuwait. The Arabs conduct at least 52, the Persians have 11 and the Jews and Christians one each making a total of 65. Of the Arab schools 27 are for boys and 25 for eirls. These gfchools are not*ubder any-control of'the'locaPgdveminent. The curriculum in most of the schools consist of reading and memorising the Quran. The American Mission school gives the best education in Kuwait, b'u't its members do not exceed 30. English is one of the principal subjects taught. (g) Administration .—Kuwait was founded about the beginning of the 18th century by some settlers of the ‘ Utub ’ a sept of the -An&amp;azah tribe, ‘over whom the Subah family enjoyed predominance. It is unnecessary to consider the early history. Suffice to say that in May 1896 Shaikh Mubarek became-Ruler ot Kuwait-on the assasination of his brother. It was he who raised Kuwait from a place of little importance to a flourishing principality, tinder his strong rule it became a -most attractive place to live in to the Arab mind and the population of the town nearly doilbled itself. The present Shaikh like his predecessors rules personally and as far as possible avoids delegations-of his authority. ‘He however has-a Qadhi or Chief Judge who tries all criminal cases as well as those connected with marriage, divorce and inheritance and a deputy in the shape of Shaikh Abdullah al-Jabir a relative who deals with all tribal cases outside the town and petty magisterial cases in the city. The Ruler iiimself gives audience to all and sundry for one or two hours daily in the market place and there de cides important cases and appeals 'by direct judg- merit. 'Should a 'Commercial dispute come before diim, hfe'refers it for enquiry and decision to a standing ‘Council df leading merchants. ‘Currency.—Kuwait has no currency of its own; Indian rupees and smaller coins are Used in the town and accounts are kept in Indian Currency but Maria Theresa Dollars are used for all dealings ^with the desrrt. The value of’Maria Therefsa Dollars •veraged £5 L G-3 per one hundred dollars during •ihe period under review. “JV./?.—The conversion of the trade figures in this report -is at the rate bPRsJfe per £'throughout. Weights and A/easures.-^-The ordinary -unit of weight is the Waqiyah of which there -are three kinds ; one of 4 lbs. 10*22 ozs.; another of 4 lbs. 15*168 ozs.-and a third of .9 lbs. 4*44 ozs. being respectively the weight of 75, 80 and 150 Maria Theresa Dollars on which coin the Waqjyah is based. The'Waqiyah of 4 lbs. 15 1 !68 ozs. is only tffced by the local-Gustoms for‘imports from‘tire desert and that* of 9 lbs. 4*44 ozs. only ferr‘the'Sale df fish, and beyond this mention of thenrno'furth'eT notice will be taken of them here. The AVaqiyah ttf'4 lbs. 10*22 ozs. is used by the local Customs for the sea imports and is universally 1 nsed in the town. A largerweight is the Mann of which‘there are‘five distinct verieties, all based on the Waqiyah of 4 lbs. 10*22 ozs., viz .:— (1) The Mann of 27 Waqiyahs, or 125 lbs. 3*94 ozs. is the local Customs measure lor weighing goods dor assessment of duty ; it is also used in the town for weighing all commodities for which there is not a special measure. (2) The Mann of 30 Waqiyahs or 139 lbs.^^4 ozs. is used for wheat, barley, Iraq rice and firewood. (3) The Mann of 24 Waqiyahs or 55 lbs. 10'64 •ozb. -ts used ifor sail cloth only. (4') The Mann of 24 Waqiyahs or 111 lbs. 5*28 ozs. is used for clarified butter, fat, salt and gypsum mortar. (5) The Mann of 36 Waqiyahs or 166 lbs. 15*92 »ozs. is used for wheat and barley wRen imported from Basrah, 20 Manns of the last named variety or approxi mately 3,340 lbs., make one Taqar. Firewood is normally sold by the Rafa of 4 Manns &lt;of'30 Waqryahs or 6,556 lbs. 10*4 ozs. Gypsum mortar is sold by the Karah of 100 Manns of 24 Waqiyahs or 11.135 lbs. The term Karah is also used for date palm branches in which sense ;lt means 1,000 branches. Beams and masts are sold by the Calicut Kandy Or 10 cubic ifeet 29 cubic inches: round rafters or *pam by the Korjah or score and boat ribs by the Itrari or 'Cart load of 40 pieces or upward according to size. The 4-gallon Kerosme oil tin is used as a measure of capacity lor the sale df water. Of the smaller weights is the .habiah 'equivalent to 3 grains Troy used in the sale of Gold and Silver. Gold is normally sold by :the mithqal attari of 18 habbahs or 54 grains and alsorby the Turkish pound and fractions thereof. -.Silver in sold by the mrfhqal Shirazzi of c24 habbahs ox 72 grains. The mithqal attari and the mithqal Shirazzi are also used 'for drugs and silk thread Rut .for .this purpose rthey are not divided into habbahs but only into halvefi.ami quarters, the nice ties of weight being arrived at using the 'two mitbqals and their fractions in eon- jection. Perfumes as -also gold fhread are sold 'by the tolah Of 180 grains. In the .pearl trade ihe .following weights and measures are most commonly used in Kuwait. Wholesale purchase of pearls .from the Captain* of the pearling boats.axe made chiefly by size. For this purpose after any exceptionally good pearls which it is desirous to dispose of separately have been removed 'remainder are assorted by being passed through a series of perforated Tnra'ss or copper Rowls, the standard set df which consists of four: the perforations of the largest called ras are *18* in3 di&amp;mster, tWe Qf th^ gecoiw&amp;b&amp;fcD •15'' k tKo8# oi tW third dhaii •Id* aud those ot the fourth rabi’ah •H'. After being assorted into ras,, ba,tn„ etc,, they change hands at a previously arranged rate at so much the mithqal ’Arabi which is equivalent to 50 grains. The ordinary pearls then usually pass from one dealer to. another on the more precise kind oi estimate based upon weight. In Kuwait Bombay mithqal, equivalent to 75 grains troy iffil sub-divided into 24 rattes each of 15 anahs ia usually employed. The unit in the dealers.’ system is called a chau and although derived from a weight it is not in itself a weight The number of chaus in a pearl is found by squamng the weight of the pearl in mithqals and multiplying the result by 330. The chau is divisible into 100 dukras and the dukrah into 100 badams. There are other kinds of chaus also occasionally used, and obtained by an identical process from other mithqals such as the Poona mithqal' of 68 grains. The normal unit of length is the dhira or cubit of 19' but for rope which is also sold by the weight, the ba or fathom is usually employed. There is no square measure in use and a plot of ground is described as being so many dhiras according to the sum of its sides. The year 1930*31. This year also was not a favourable one for trade and this was mainly due to there being no trade with Nejd. Consequently many petty shopkeepers have left for Bahrein, .lubail and tjatif to seek employment. The pearl “ oatch ” on the whole was good but the pearl market remained so low that good pearls could be purchased for 50 per cent, less than previous years. It was however expected that on the advent of some of the well known pearl merchants that the- local market would improve aud prices of pearls would rise but unfortunately no tangible increase took place and the financial condition of the pearl merchants became so. acute that although they had safes full of pearls most of the merchants were not only unable to pay their large debts but were not in a position to pay even the small wages due to the pearling crews. To ease the situation the Shaikh of Kuwait had to take drastic measures and forced merchants to sell pro perty even at a loss to discharge their debts. Ac cording to the Customs export figures some £47,917 worth of pearls were estimated to have been ex ported for sale in India and elsewhere. But this figure as explained under “ Exports ” cannot be relied on i» any way. Imports. The total imports by sea amounted to £282,242 and showed a decrease of 24-09 per cent, as compared with the figures for 1929-30. This decrease can be explained by the fact that during the year His Majesty Abdul Aziz al Saud, Ruler of Nejd and Hej^observed* a stricter blockade against trafia fjrom Kuwait with, the hinterland and, to the general depressed state of World, Trade. Of the total, im ports trade 4,7*-65 per cent. was. with India, 23-7,5 er cent, with Iraq, 21-II per cent, witfi Persian oast, 2- 27 per cent, with Arabian Coast, and 5' 22 per cent, with other countries. Exports. I The total exports by sea amounted to £196,753 and showed an increase of 7*57* per cent, compared with the figures for 1929-30. This is accounted for by the known increased export of clarified butter, fish oil, building materials and pearls. Also, pearls of the aggregate amount of £47,917 are shown in the tables as having been exported for sale to Indian markets, accurate figures of these as well as specie can never be obtained, as both are nearly always carried away amongst personal luggage. Of the total export trade 45-37 per cent, was with India, 15-97 per cent, with Arab Coast, 13-66 per cent, with Iraq^ 24-76 per cent, with Persian Coast and *24 per cent, with other countries. Pearl Fishing. This ift the most important trade of Kuwait. The Town possesses over 700 pearl boats h u t many of these have not been to sea for sometimes due to the depressed state of the pearl trade. The average number of boats w-hich of lecent years visited the banks is not nqre than 350 and this figure has decreased as the market was worse than last year. The Kuwait fishing fleet consists of two arts the small boats which fish off the Neutral one, Sudah and Huzum areas to the Sou,th of Kuwait and the larger boats with 6 to 8 “ Sweeps ” on either side which go further afield and join up with the Bahrein and Qatar fleets. The Kuwait main pearling fleet works under the eye of an Amir al Bahr, or Admiral and no boat is allowed to return home without sanction. The “ Rukbah ’ is the name given to the commencement of the pearl season, and the “ Gufful ” to the end when all boats return home. The season falls somewhere between 15th May and 15th September. Customs Administration and lighterage. The administration of the Kuwait Customs is supervised by a local Arab and the system works satisfactorily. An import duty of 4 per cent, ad valorem is charged, and there is no export duty except on goods brought in from the interior such as clarified butter, hides, wool, etc., on which 4 per cent, is charged if exported. Freight, Shipping, and Navigation .—Kuwait owns afiout 291 sailing vessels engaged in carrying trade4 ' As distinct from pearling and fishing boats. These include 80 having a capacity of over 300 tons, 21 of over 230 tons and 67 of 100 tons. Forty-seven boats were employed constantly in bringing drinking water to the town from Shatt-al-Arab. On an average eight such boats arrive daily and bring 80,000 gallons of water (worth £53) to the town. The British Indian Steam Navigation Company, Ltd., maintain a weekly service from India and a fortnightly service to India. The steamers owned and chartered by (1) The Hansa Steamship Company of Bremen, Germany and (2) The Strick and Eller- man and Buckn Lines of London also called during the year under report but their service has not been a regular one. The rate of freight by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers was £1-0-0 from Bombay and Karachi to Kuwait and from Kuwait to Bombay and Karachi was £1-13-4 per ton respectively throughout the year. Communications .—Kuwait possesses a combined Post and Telegraph Office worked by the Posts and Telegraph Department of the Iraq Government. Foreign rates of postage and telegram charges are applicable from Kuwait to the United Kingdom and other countries. Mails for the United Kingdom and the continent are despatched from Kuwait via overland route, Baghdad—Haifah, and take 14 days on an average. Letters can also be sent by Air Mail at Basrah both to Europe and India. Parcels from the United Kingdom for Kuwait take 3 to 5 weeks by the above mentioned Overland route and the C. 0. D. and Insurance systems are also available. The Kuwait Motor Transport Company which is also under a Postal contract with the Iraq Post and Telegraph Department for the conveyance of both sea mails from India and Overland mails from Basrah and vice versa continued to function between Kuwait and Zubair, and maintained the road in good condition. The fare by this Company’s motors is eight shillings per seat and the journey each way on an average occupies four hours. Sea Fisheries. The only truly local produce of Kuwait is that yielded by the harbour fisheries which are a valuable asset. Besides boat-and weight-nets and lines traps or tidal weirs constructed of reed hurdles are also employed : the fish enter them with the flowing tide and are left behind at the ebb. The majority of the fish caught is consumed locally, but a small proportion is dried and exported to Basrah and elsewhere. Boat Building. Fifteen boats of an aggregate value of £2,080 were built in Kuwait during the year under review. Of these 3 had a carrying capacity of 100 tons each. These figures are not included in the trade report. Many smaller rowing boats were also built which it is unnecessary to enumerate. Labour. The price of labour remained nearly the same as for the previous year. An unskilled labourer earned from Is. 8d. to 2 shillings, a carpenter fxJN 4 to 8 shillings and a boat builder from 4 to 8 shil lings per diem. Minerals. The only mineral product worked is gypsum mortar, which is manufactured by the simple process of firing rubbish in broad shallow excavations. There is a large gypse ferous tract on the out skirts of Kuwait Town and it is found in several other parts of the principality. “Oil” indications in the shape of 2 bitumen and oil surface springs exist in the hinterland but whether these can be worked commercially has yet to be seen. Domestic Animals. The most valuable domestic animals are camels of which there are large numbers, sheep, goats and donkeys of the latter many of a large white breed originally from Hassa, are found in the town. These are sometimes over 13 hands in height and a good one will cost about £20. There are also some horses and a few horned cattle. Agriculture. Neither Kuwait nor its environments can boast of any agricultural resources. There are no date plantations of any value, no fields and not many kitchen gardens. The villages to the south-east of Kuwait supply a limited but increasing quantity of vegetables and melons. The agricultural centre in the principality is Jahrah which has greatly improved during the year owing to the facilities afforded by motor transport in taking the products into town. There are over 2,500 date trees. The staple crops are wheat, barley and lucerne, but melons, watermelons, pumpkins, beans and some other vegetables are also grown in increasing quantities. The above crops are mostly irrigated but a small amount of wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone. The agriculture of Jahrah might be consi derably increased if more money were sunk in it. The most important agricultural centre is the island of balickah where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches, also some vegetables especially carrots which are of an ex ceptionally fine quality but the agriculture of the island is generally inferior to that of Jahrah.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000134_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3743</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000134</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3743</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/29 'Persian Gulf, Kuwait: Trade Reports 1930/31 to 19..'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1932/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-12-14T22:27:09</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (202 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 204; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
