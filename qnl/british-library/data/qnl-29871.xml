He can give no reason for this reticence, He adds that the letter purported only to recognise Saqr as -ffard- Tandmah for negotiations with the oil company - nothing else. 3 . I think that there was a letter all rigdit, but owing to Saqr’s having earned the displeasure of the Sultan, the Sultan is now playing down 0 aqr*s position and hence the letter.

Your letter No. 542/4/50 dated 19th December. 2. Under present policy it seems that vre have no alternative to informing Shaikh Sulaiman that he must obtain the agreement of the Sultan as well as the Imam. 3. Pt the same time I think that this Shaikh* s aim is recognition of his independant status as much as wealth, and insistence on his approach thrugh the Sultan and Imam may tempt him to seek agreements with Saudi Arabia and Aramco, as indeed he appears to contemplate. 4. Hence I think that before discouraging Shaikh from direct approach, Sultan should be fully informed and urged to take more positive action. 5. I have discussed this to some extent in my letters No. 20/8/64/50 of 27 th Ocdfeo'be® December and 7/11/767/50 of 15th October. 6. '.Vhole position including question of boundaries seems to require detailed consideration during your next visit when Sultan is present, but in* in the meantime it appears essential to discover whether P.C.L. are anxious or prepared to examine the area and develop it if suitable. 7. If they are, then, assuming His Ala.jesty’s Government are sufficiently interested and prepared to modify policy to any extent, it ould be possible to tell Sultan that, though we might 'play the game' others might not, and His Majesty* s Government cannot afford to risic loss of these resources by estrangement of Shaikhs from the Sultanate, and if he does not attempt to take early and more positive action His Majesty's Government may be compelled to recondider their attitude. I do not think that advice alone will move the Sultan, but, with adequate explanation, I believe he might respond quite well to some pressure.

Please refer to your letter No. 378/78/50G dated the 14th December 1950* about the conversations of Shaikhs l\ihainmad bin Salimin and Yasir bin Famud with Stobart. 2 * I am very glad that you have asked the Political Agent Bahrain to instruct the Political Officer Trucial Coast to discourage ai^r Sultanate Shaikhs v/ho may call upon him from any idea other than that we shall only deal withfhCm through the Sultan. So long as the policy is for us to support the Sultan’s efforts to establish control over all the territory which we regard as falling within his dominions, however disappointing or feeble those efforts may appear to us at times, that seems to be the only correct attitude. 3* Fver since Bird’s and Saiyid Ahmad Ibrahim’s tour, ai d Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of the Naim got out of hand with his demands^ (the resuit,the Sultan alleges, of Bird*s direct dealings to which he says he agreed against his better judgment), the Sultan has cut off the allowances, such as theykwere, and not I fancy as jjtated by them, of the Al bu Shamis and Nairn Shaikhs, and intends to leave them in the cold until they come to heel. But for the success of this policy he begs us not to deal with them or encourage them in any way, arid, as Isay, until our policy is changed, it seems that we must support him whole-heartedly. I fear that it is because he does not quite trust us, that he is so reluctant at times to let people travel about his territory, even when it is not risky for then to do so. 4. Of course this flaw in the Sultan's scheme, as I see it, is that whilst we play this game, there are others on the Saudi side who may not, and Shaikhs like Sulaiman bin Fam*yar and S aqr -bin Suit an, who more than anything want independence and so individual profits, may attempt to break away to those who will recognise them. In fact there seems to me to be a direct connection between Sulaiman bin Hamyar’s approach to His ^Wjesty’s Government through Thesiger, his letter to me, his meetings with Thoms, the recent tour of the 'adventurer Abdulla Samil and now Shaikh vasir bin -amud s journey to Hasa. Both Shaikh^s / liihaamad bin Salimin^or Salmin) and Yasir bin Hamud / are mentioned in my notes on the Sultanate tribes. Yaoir is the Taraimah of the Janabah and lives at Adam, or at Iz towards a d not far from rizwa y ard is a friend of Sulrfjrnn bin Farryar. Both tribes are Ghafiris, and it is not impossible that these or even all of the Chafiri faction of the interior might unite under Sulaiman bin Hairyar and try for independent recognition. -ulaiman bin Hanyar is quite definitely progessively inclined, and was only prevented from continuing the motor road from Nizwa beyond }mti don the V/adi Sam ail to Muscat by the Imam and people of the Wadi up to Nakhl, which one can reach by motor car from Muscat. 6 .

British Agency, Sharjah, November 12th 1950. Dear Felly, I have just received two visits of no small interest, one from Shaikh Muhammad bin Salimin of A1 Bu Shamis and the other from Shaikh Yasir bin Hamud, Tamimah Shaikh of the Janabah. Both asked me to try to get P.C.L. to work in their territories. I will describe the two interviews below and add my own commentss A.1 Bu Shamig, 2. Shaikh Muhammad bin Salirain is typical of the grasping and perfidious bedouin Shaikhs who infest this part of Oman. He approached me on 11th November and asked me if H.M.G. would use their good offices to arrange a settlement between him and the Sultan whereby his tribe would be guaranteed a fair share of any receipts from oil development which they might facilitate in the area occupied by them (south and west of Hafit). He claimed that unless we were to mediate between him and the Sultan, agreement would never be reached as the Sultan, would expect to swallow the lion’s share of any pay ments made by the Company. I promised to consider the matter which, in any case would have to be referred to Bahrain. He came back again this morning and characteristically had changed his tune. He thought that perhaps Shaikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi would be a better ally than the Sultan and he would possibly prefer to deal with the Company through him. I explained that it was not for me to advise him for or against one al legiance or the other: he was not in treaty relations with us and he had better make up his own mind as to which way he was going to face. He then said that if P.C.L. did not come and work in his territory, he would invite- 'other Companies' to work there. I took the opportunity of reminding him that if he were to cut off all connexion both with Zaid and with the Sultan, his proposed Company, even if they came, might find themselves unable to run their pipelines through either A1 Bu Falah or Sultanate territory. He also asked me for a subsidy from H.M.G. which I naturally refused, but premised to report our conversation to you. Janabah. 3. Shaikh Yasir bin Hamud was brought to me by Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr of Sharjah. He is a dignified man, aged about 50 with an active intelligence. (whilst speaking to him about his country I produced a map marked in English, the first he had ever seen. Once I had explained the legend he was able to identify nearly every feature on it without my assistance). 4. Shaikh Yasir began by saying that he had come on behalf of Shaikh Sulaiman bin Bamyer. He said that Shaikh Suleiman*s followers and the JanabaJj, whilst they enjoyed security and order in their present state, were anxious to enjoy the greater wealth and development which oil would bring. The Imam / was C.J. Felly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.* was opposed to the entry of foreigners at the moment, but he was now very feeble, with failing sight and fast approaching his end. When he died, the Ghafiris would, according to Shaikh Yasir, turn to Sulaiman bin Hamyer as their next leader (Chauncy's iote forwarded under your C/TC-174 of 9th October 1950, however, suggests the previous Imam's son Yahya as the Ghafiri candidate). Sulaiman would have no such objections to the entry of Christians, and, even if he did not obtain unanimous support from the tribes, would be in a position to bring in any parties he wished through KHALUF on the Arabian sea (G.S.G.S. 2555 sheet North F-40 20 deg 27 min North 58 deg 5 min East) and the cVadis HALFAIN and ANDAM immediately to the North. In preparation for this, he wished firstly for a Treaty with H.M.G. and secondly for an agreement with the Comoany. I expressed surprise that a people so well known for their dislike of the Christian should ask for a treaty with us, when all they had to do in order to open up their country, was to acknowledge the sovereignty of Muscat, a Muslim State already in treaty relations wth us. Shaikh Yasir replied that firstly there was no prospect of the Ghafiris ever accepting Muscat domination which could only be oppressive and self seeking, and secondly that the prejudice against the Christian was dying fast. The anti-Christian feeling had arisen, he said, because of the support which we had given in the past to the Al Bu Said. Because the Al Bu Said were vindictive and generally unpopular we, as their allies were regarded as being of like character. The prejudice was more in the nature of a fear that we should enter Oman to seize their lands and properties than of an actual religious distaste. They had therefore hesitated in the past to approach H.M.G. They had now observed British influ- •ence in other Gulf States, and had found it beneficent; if any nation was to coordinate their interests, it should be Britain. This may read very much like the usual 'Khadim al Dowla' flattery which one hears from petty intriguers up and down the Gulf, but I believe Shaikh Yasir to have been sincere, firstly because he appeared to be a dignified man of no mean calibre and above flattery and secondly because our own brand of political intervention seems to have earned us more popularity than we are inclined to suppose in these days of Arab nationalism. I expressed surprise at the whole approach but promised to report his views to H.M.G. He asked me to pass any reply through the Shaikh of Sharjah. I enquired before parting if there was ever a change of a foreigner visiting his country. He said that he could borrow Sulaiman bin Hamyer's car and pick up anyone who cared to land by air on the plain at Bir al Hamaid 15 miles north of Adam (22 deg 15 min North 57 deg 27 min East). 5. My chief impression gathered from these two interviews is that we should now give up any hopes which we once entertained of opening up the interior of Oman through the agency of the Sultan of Muscat. The unpopularity of Muscat does not only stem from Salyid Said's own character, but also from the atti tude of such relatives as Saiyid Ahmed bin Ibrahim who behaves towards the tribes with the contemptuous pomposity of which only the town Arab is capable. If we intend to open up Oman, I think that the following two courses of action might commend themselves. 6. Firstly, as regards the Al Bu Shamis, I think that they will probably follow any lead which ve may give them. Presumably If wr-re to nnnoar to favour Zald, they might be willing to *ough him. This would have the ad- ronsiderable prestige and energy *he Bani Kaab might follow their / exampleexample and strengthen Zaid's hand sufficiently to ensure that the Naim would not be capable of disrupting the union. In view of the possibility of an approach by the A1 Bu Shamis to ABAMCO it might be as well to encourage them to sign up with Zaid at an early date. This, at any rate would ensure that P.C.L. could begin survey operations south and west of Hafit, provided Zaid was capable of exerting his influence. This course of action would have the disadvantage of incurring the Sultan's displeasure even to the point of his refusing possible pipe-line facilities in the Gulf of Oman, but at the same time, would mean that the area and its inhabitants would be more amenable to our Influence than they would be in the unlikely event of their eventually passing under the ccntrol of Muscat whore we may soon be without so much as jurisdiction over British subjects. 7. as regards the approach by Shaikh Yasir, the issues involved are so far - reaching that it is hardly for me to comment at this level, I have endeavoured to avoid encouraging falste hopes or on the other hard, so discouraging him that he drops the idea entirely. Should youwish to see him before he fern returns to Oman, I will try to persuade him to fly up to Bahrain accompanied by Ali Bustani. I have not, of course suggested this, tut if you would like to see him, I should be grateful if you would kindly telegraph as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, Sgd. P.D. Stobart.I have read the notes and find that what was recorded In both of them was all said by Shaikh Mohamed, except that in H.E the P.R*s note it is written that the Shaikh was going to Hofuf to ask Saud bin Jiluwi jfcQ reftavgE a woman who has been carried off by s.Qm of Mr ,.. Tfres^gesls friends . If my memory serves me, I think that the Shaikh said he was going to Saudi Arabia to complain of the tribes to Amir Saud who, either would take disciplinary action against them or he would permit the Shaikh himself to do so, in other words to fight them. Among the tribes who raided their parts, was that of Shaikh Mubarak bin London’s friend. The reason why he was visiting Saudi Arabia was because the tribes concerned were Saudis. When the P.R pointed out to him that it would be difficult for a company to operate In their parts, without the assurance of the cooperation of all the tribes settling there, he answered that if the tribes were well treated they would behave well. He also mentioned that the Sultan discontinued the payments since this year only and most probably because of their attitude towards the company ?

The document referred to by Rogers is, I think, only a letter that S&amp;iyid Ahnad bin '^rahim is understood to have obtained from the various factions of the Na*im tribe (not even including A1 bu Sh^mis division which has broken away) accepting Saqr bin Sult a n as their Tamimah. Also, when I was in Salalah recently, Woods- Ballard gave me to understand that, as far as the Sultan was concerned. Shaikh Saqr's Tamimahship was in abeyance, and I reported the position in para 5 of my letter No. 5/8/65/50 dated the 16th Nay 1950 to Sir Rupert. The Sultan did not himself tell me this, and still described Saqr bin Sultan as Tamimah of the Na'im in some lists of tribes he jave me through ffoods-Ballard, but not of any other tribe. -3 If i^gers wants a list of those Na'im oh^ikhs, and their sections and sub-sections, who are claimed to have signed the docunent accepting Saqr bin Sultan, who is hi^iSelf a Shaikh of one sub-section, as Tamimah, I will ask the Sultan, but this will need to be done orally, apfewe will have to await Joods-dallard's return in mid-August, or if, as is probable, he cannot answer, the Sultan's return in October. Lf.. I shall also have to wait till then to clarify the precise nature of the document: but I am sure I am right and the only value of the document will be to show that the Sultan has some influence with the Na'im in Buraimi p nd Dhahirah, and it will not help to establish his claims to authority over the al bu Shania, Beni Ka'ab or Beni v^itab, which are the other” tribes 'in that area and which, I think, is the point Rogers is after. 5 Personally, I feel it is high time that it was realised that the Sultan has got no proofs of his boundaries. They never have been defined, other than is running along the Ruba'al 'hali. Naturally the Sultan does not want to be forced to show his trumpless hand, a nd he relies on us to examine the Saudi olai is / regarding which, incidentally, the Sultan is in complete ignorance: but if they encroach beyond the .uba'al/i/aii into what has, at least in modern times, always been regarded es Omani territory (Sultanate or Truoial), he is fairly sure the Saudi claims will be capable of rebuttal, and he should not be asked to prove the status quo, until or unless the Saudi Government produce something pretty convincing. Jhen that is produced he will try to answer it, but he does not want to start trying to prove something in advance which he may never be called upon to prove, or, as I say / ;o show his hand before he has seen something of the other aiders. Anyhow, it is my belief that the reason for the Sultan's reticence is not a reluctance to help in his own case, but a reluctance to show that he ... . C.J. Pelly Ksq, O.B.E. Offg: Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. BAHRAIN.to show that he cannot do §oj and I feel that this should be sympathetically understood: the only chance of his getting control of the Buraimi tribes is if they are left free of other influence - including oil companies emissaries, whom, he says, should negotiate only through him. He never wanted to give Bird sanction to negotiate direct, and he did so as a result of persuasion against his better judgement, which Saqr bin Sultan's subsequent behaviour proved correct. Now he has to begin again, but it all takes time and is, in fact, dependent on sitting the other man out. If we want to help him, the best way we can is to leave him alone - he really has no more to tell us - and head the others off. I hope I am not unduly labouring the point. I am merely trying to make the Sultan's position and attitude plain: I am not representing ay own views, but what I believe to be his. I am sure, if you show this letter to VToods-Ballard on his way through, he will endorse it. Yours sincerely,STXRFT FS/1081/13 FORFIGN OFFICF, S.W.l. 6 th June, 1950.

Tlic last time the Shaik is^bf these tribes visited Muscat was in 1943 when they came in together. But only three came, those of the Beni Ka*ab, siitab and Al-bu-Sh^rnis. Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, whom Ahmad bin Ibrahim ^ the iiinister for the Interior) had arranged with the other Shaikhs of the Naim to regard as the Tapiiwah and is said to have secured a letter to that effect, refu s ed to come in, and has lot in fact visited Muscat for 6 or 7 years, as he is said to be afraid to trust the Sultan. The Sultan presumably jave the Shaikhs who came in customary presents, including money, just as he recently gave the Hinawi leader, Sglih bin Isa al Harthi from Ibra ammunition, rifles and Rs 6000/«. I think it must be these occasional presents that the Sultan refers to, though he specifically stated to me that he paid them allowances for ‘Maintaining order, and fined them if they fail^jto do so. Since they have not been in since 1948# and the Sultan has certainly not been out, nor has the Minister of Interior or other official since 194B, it seems clear that if allowances are paid/regularly, and they are more likely to be in the nature of presents, than salaries.

It will be seen that the Beni v^itab are divided, and that one portion live in Tnicial and Independent Oman, and the other in the Sultanate of Oman. The largest settled portion live in Dahirah District, around Aflaj Bani Qitab, well inside Sultanate territory. It apoears, from a note recorded by Bird in 1943* that the tribe derives from Phalli rah but a section of it was defeated some years ago by the Dhawahir tribe, and was driven out to the country north west of Baraind oasis, lliese Northern and Southern seotions do not get on w*U., and it is to the latter who live in Sultanate territory, and whose Bhaikh is Mohanmad bin Ali bin Rubaiyah, to which the Sultan lays claim as a Sultanate Omsai tribe, though up till June 1943 declares the Sh a ikh had not met the Sultan. 5 With regard to (b), I would again invite attention to Loriroer 0^962 in wliioh the Beni Ka’ab are described as partly in Trucial and partly in Sultanate Oman. I thought that the Sultan clairtied -ahadhal as well^as the Jfadi Hatta in his territory, but perhaps it is only the laiter to which he refer/s, and about which there is no doubt. I will ask him when ^3 y 3 back. Incidentally, Bird in another note written at the same time {Juae^j gives the name of their Shaikh as Obaid bin Tisiifi, and confirms that the Sultan pays the Shaikh a small allowance, though. Bird says, this is to restrain his people from forays on the ^atioah coast, ^ils ®®y wsU bs tbs nature of rl 1 allowances which the Sultan claims he pays to the Shaikhs in these parts, and we are aware that he has little or no control over them. 6 . The question of control by alluwanoes etc: seems to me to appl; more to the Naim and A1 bu Shamis, since their settlements are in the Juraimi area, regarding which territory there is much doubt, and to support his claim the Sultan added that these tribes owe allegiance to him and he pays them allowances. Here the question of control arises to support the territorial claim, whereas in the former two cases, with the explanation I now offer, territorial claim is, I think, evident from the geographical situation. As I have already stated the Sultan’s control is light every where, c # g. Js&amp;la&amp;v out it is not disputed that -nat is within the c■ erall accepted limits of the Sultanate. y # /hether these and the other Shaikhs hare recently visited Muscat, and whether the Sultan does in fact pa/^illowances he claims, rnd what they amount to, I shall endeavour to discover as desired, but X thought it advisable to clarify now what sections of the tribes Be d and tab the Sultan refers to, when he talks about them being Sultanate 0 Tfl a nl tribes, and their location.

Thank you for ycur letter r o. r A 1539/50 of the 1st Kay about the Information given you by Thesifer. We have been trying to obtain fur ther Information about the first point you mention but so far without success. Sc far as we know however It was the Amir Saud and not Ibn Saud who wrote to Shaikh Saqr of the Na'ira and the approach may have been of a quite harm less nature. I will make enquiries about the second point. We have, I think, heard nothing about Americans in the Liwa area since the spring of last year when Stobart met with his adventure. 2. I have suggested the reply to be given to Sulainian bin Kimyar in my despatch Kc.36 (378/2/50G) of the 26th April but I should pre fer tr ignore his request altogether. I only suggested a reply because Thesiger lade a po J nt of having promised him one. If he presses us on the subject ho could perhaps be told that we refuse to give ary reply. 3.

Dear Hay, ♦ Thank you for your letter No.289/6/50G of the 1st April about Thesigers exploration of Oman. I enclose a note of the information he gave us , which is largely similar to what he told you, as reported in the record of your conversation enclosed with your letter of 1st April. There are two points on which we should be glad to have further information. One is the reported approach by Ibn Saud to the Chief of the Na*im and whether you think we can do anything to counteract possible Saudi penetration (I assume you will consider as out of the question any encourage ment to Abu Dhabi on the lines that Thesiger suggests). The other point is the rumour of American (Aramco) encroachment in the Liwa area. We know that there has been encroachment of this kind on previous occasions and we should like to have any recent details. We obviously cannot take any official cognisance of Sulaiman bin Himya^s request forrecognition as an independent Shaikh, and it would perhaps be better to ignore it alto gether for the present. He is hardly likely to be open to Saudi influence if, as I understand it, he is cut off from Saudi territory by the Duru* and others owing allegiance to the Imam. I am sending a copy of this letter and the enclosure to Trott. Yours ever, Sd. G.W. Furlonge. Lieut. Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Bahrain.COPY RECORD OF A VISIT TO PASTERN DEPARTMF.NT BY MR. THFSIGFR ON 12TH APRIL. Mr. Thesiger called at the Foreign Office on the 12th April. He had returned from the Oman where he had been ex ploring since October 1949* His route on this journey was from the Trucial Coast south eastwards through Buraimi and Ibri to a point south west of Nezwa (the Iman^s headquarters). The following paragraphs contain a summary of Thesiger's information about the situation in the interior of Oman. Around Nezwa and to the south-west, north-west and south-east of Jebel Akhadar the tribes are generally under the authority of the Imam. This includes the Bani Riyam, the Junuba (that part of the tribe is the interior) and, for the most part, the Burn*. These are both anti- christian and xenophobe, and also anti-Wahabhi. They are also entirely outside the control of the Sultan, thus they would never allow any oil exploration under the Sultan's auspices, nor are they likely to admit oil companies by direct negotiation. But they will also stand firm against Saudi intrusions. It is probable that the Imam's writ runs further south to the coast among the Harasis, the Wahibba and the Junuba (that part of the coast opposite Marirah Island). If this is sc, it is unlikely that any attempt at penetration by the oil company would be successful and might only have the effect of encouraging the Imam's tribes to push north towards Muscat. The Imam himself is an old man, probably over 70. His successor is likely to be the young son of a former Imam, Salim, but the policy is unlikely to change. Thesiger discounted reports that the Sultan would be elected as Imam saying that this was wishful thinking on the Sultan's part and that his influence was non-existent in the interior. Sulaiman bin Himyar, who accompanied Thesiger for part of his Journey south of Buraimi, is anxious to be recognised as an independent Shaikh in the same way as the Trucial Coast Shaikhs. He owes allegiance neither to the Sultan nor to the Imam but appears to have a considerable following in the area north-east of Ibri. The areaaround Buraimi, Thesiger regards as weak and open to Saudi penetration. The tribes (Bu Shams, Na'im, etc.) owe allegiance neither to the Sultan nor to the Imam and are probably amenable to influence from Ibn Saud. Thesiger repor ted that he heard that the paramount chief of the Na'im had recently received a letter from Ibn Saud, though he did not know the contents ^his has been confirmed by the political agenjfcj There is however a wholesome respect for the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and his brother Sayid. Thesiger's view was that annexation of these areas by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi would not meet with any great resistance and would greatly strengthen this weak link on the frontier with Saudi Arabia. Another 'soft spot” is the Liwa area. Here the Bani Yas are open to American penetration, and Thesiger reported rumours of American visitors to Liwa and further north-east into khat is probably Abu Dhabi territory. He felt that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi should make sure of retaining his hold on the Liwa area and that this should not present any great difficulty. The people are susceptible to financial regards but they are in fact part of the same tribe as the rest of Abu Dhabi (Bani Yas) and are quite ready to remain loyal. /On2 - On the possibilities of oil, Thesiger thought there were likely looking structures in the heart of the Imam's country, but that penetration to these areas would be an impossible task and would meet with strong resistance. He recommended putting the whole of the central area (between the Huqf and the Bani Kitab) in cold storage for a few years, and concentrating on the weak spots in the north-west and the Liwa area, which is well giorth of any frontier line the Saudis are Justified in claiming.(a) th© n T r?im f th© Al bu OmmiB and the frml Ka f ab ara Oman tribae end the fultsn la alwaya prepared te oonelder any reprorentatlon from then In re^erd to the eettlenent of their Internal affa're* (b/ Th© boundary between the tribes mentioned above and other c*nan trlbee on th© one hand end the tribes of the True lei Ooaat on the other la wholly a tribal affair to bo Bottled * by direct negotiation between the tribes theraeelvee.

Sir Your obedient vent.Secret , W&lt;V5o. The British Consulate, ^ MUSCAT . 16th May, 1930. My dear Sir Rupert, Please refer to my letter No. 3/3/W pO dated the 23 rd April 1950. I asked the Sultan whether he oould give me some more detailed description of his boundary where it marches with the -racial Sheikhdoms. He was most ohary of ooranitting himself and reluctant to talk at all, but when I suggested that if we did not know which tri - b es and which Shaikhs he claimed, he oould hardly blame us for dealing with S frftjighg who claimed to be independent of him, he opened up. But in taking this information, I think we should now ree se that if we do continue to deal with Shaikhs he claims independently we shall have no excuse for not knowing, and the oil companies and Political officer Trucial Coast 6rould perhaps be suitably informed. His Highness says that he has himself never defined a boundary (as Brenner would indicate), though various Political ^ificeis have suggested to him what it might be. He says there is no ^ap between his and Abu Dhabi*s territories, and that everyone there knows very well whether they are Omani or Abu Dhabi tribes. There may be differences of opinion as to what precise bits of land lie in what tribal area, but these questions are for the tribes to resolve themselves, and to appeal to Abu Dhabi or him if they like. If they appeal to him, he will certainly intervene.

The arrangement^ whereby Shaikh Saar bin Sultan was recog nised as t hep aim* s paramount chief has fallen through for the present, as he bft« recently defied the Sultan, and the Sultan is no longer supporting him vis^a-vis the others. But he feels that if no one interfere® and starts dealing with Shaikh oa^r, and all these Shaikhs realise that nothing will be gained except through the medium of the Sultan they will all come round and toe the line. Again he blames people like Thesiger and Bird for unsettling them. Since ny visit to Salalah I am not nearly so perturbed about what I felt was the Sultan* s apathy. He took the greatest pains to show me how he works (sort of soft spot tactics), and how he must go slew and win the confidence of his people. He admitted his control might be slight, but it was far improved to his father’s time - witness Sur, and Shuwaimiyah. iiThen the latter was to be surveyed in 193 1 » it v* 3 ruL?^ out as too dangerous. • 1 • The Sultan has at last produced some details of tribes, b» I they are mostly in Arabic and I shall have to get them transla ed, arid set in order.

His Highness the Sultan has indicated the boundary of his territories along the Rub al Khali, but some more detailed description of it, where it marches with the Trucial Sheikhdoms would be appreciated for our own purposes. For example does His Highness claim control over the Naim Tribe In the Buraiad area, and what Tillages or oases actually fall within His Highness's border In this part. Incidentally, it seems that attempts to unify the Naim, Al bu Shanda and Beni Ka'ab have not been successful but It Is thought that if His Highness the Sultan were to take a direct personal Interest in the tribes concerned this might be welcome and successful.

All that I have so far been able to discover among ay books and records is 6-h %Ull' SJI p r ill *6 (a) an account of his visit to Buraiai by Col Miles in 1875 of which an abridged version is contained in his book at p. 532 et.seq, and which omits the remark regarding allegiance. I an extract of the fuller version. Lorieer quotes .files as one of his authorities in the footnote at p. 264 of the second volume of his itisetteer, which is curious since he describes Buraiai as inrier^ruientjan^ (b) a letter No. C/232 dated the 23rd October 1934 from Premier to the Political Resident describing the Sultanate boundary in 1934 , a® a result of his enqjiiry from the Sultan. This includes Euraimi in the Sultan* s territory and describes the Shaikhs as in his pay. This, of course, is only the Sultan’s version. Watts obtained a similar definition from him in 1936. Howes in 1940 wrote to the Resident as in the extract from his letter attached, whilst Kickinbotham at the same time qualified this vide the extract from his letter also enclosed. Metoalfe in 1944 obtained a similar definition from the Sultan, and, recently, in connection with the Saudi claims, the Sultan repeated it to rae» but from everything I can gather from '^oods-Ballt.rd and the Sultan, the latter has no evidence whatever to produce, arid, except for the document which Said Ahmad bin Ibrahim obtained, and to whii you refer in your letter under reference, I believe there is none. Even so it would not appear that Loriaer was correct in describing Buraimi as independent! it seems more a question of degree to which the area falls within the territories of the Sultan and Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. Adiaittedly the Sultan*a influence ia slight and, perhaps, becoming less and lass through his apathy, but that doss not seem to alter the position regarding recognition by us, at least to date. I cannot help feeling, however, that, in addition to the Sultan*s apathy, such effort as was ay* to increase his influence was not helped by either Bird’s or Thesiger's activities. The former made direct payments to the Shaikhs, and the latter carries messages to His tajesty's Government and gets replies. The tribes concerned would naturally expect to get greater dividends by direct acknowledgement and by direct negotiation with the oil co’ipii'iies a.id would encourage representatives of His Jajesty'a Government or the Company to think •••• His Kxeallency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.H., C.S.I.

If we showed firmly that we would negotiate through no one but the Sultan the picture might change very quickly: but, of course, it Is up to the Sultan to do his part* It is this that worries both T/oods-Ballard and ms* Vie are being driven to the conclusion that the Sultan is either lazy or too timid, or really does not care, and wants only to be left in peace to pursue an idyllic existence* Ideas come and go - coal, oil, agriculture, electricity, water, fish - and the story seems always the sarae; if it means any exertion, interest is lost and the scheme founders on inertia, however, 1 am now visiting the Sultan at Salalah and shall perhaps be able to discover better what Is in his mind, and what interest he is likely to take in both Buralml and Kuqf, and whether he can support his claims to the former, and I will report upon my return* I have not copied this to Pally, but enclose spare copies in case they are required for this or any other purpose* Yours sincerely. 1C. fmV Extract from •Private 1 letter dated the let April I9/.0 from Major T.

He makes no claim to those villages held by the Beni las and agrees that they are under the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The boundary as shown is probably very inaccurate as I jfoavw little doubt that no one has worried about the barren rocks and stony desert areas. This inaccuracy is probably greatest between Shaikhs and Baraind, and the simplest thing as regards this area im to look on the area acknowledged to be other than Peal Xa f ab as belonging to the Sultan until one reaches the outskirts of the Baraimi Oasis.

Wo. 106 BRITISH iiGBWCY, SHiiRJiiH. 24th January, 1950. Bear Pelly, | There is one item of news from Buraimi which may be of interest to the Political Resident ana yourself. Shaikh Zaia bin Sultan has apparently failed to unify the Rai'm, a 1 Bu Shamis, and Beni - Ka'ab as he had hoped, and things have reverted to their usual state of anarchy in the area. 3. Wo aoubt, if, as is possible the &gt; : 1 Bu Falah have more money at their disposal in luture, another attempt at unification may be made by them. 4 « I gather that it is still not too late for Muscat to assert its authority there, Saiyid ithi^ad bin Ibrahim's mission having failed not only because Zaid was working against him, but also because Saiyid Ahmad is personally unpopular in Buraimi. He has a reputation for arrogance and meanness. My iniormant, shaikh Abuullah bin Abaulaziz, a i^ejai Qadhi who commands some respect locally, considers that if the sultan took a hand personally in the negotiations, he might enjoy more success than he thinks, ana the tribes might welcome the intervention of an experienced ruler ana of a government, such as Muscat's as opposed to the purely tribal authority which the a1 Bu falah ohaikhs would provide, as long, however, as the sultan fails to grasp the nettle and watches events from a dignified distance, the fear of shabby treatment at the hands of his relatives will no aoubt persist ana will confound his politics.

If the area is in fact res nulllus Ibn saud has clearly just as much right to try to establish his authority as the a1 bu Falah. We can only keep him out of it if we take our stand on the claim that it is part of Muscat and we have no grounds for interfering in the matter at all unless we can support such a claim. C.J.
