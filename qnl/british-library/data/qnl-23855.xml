The sun rises say at 5 a.m. and an hour is sufficient for our staff to get to the office. At present we and most of the other British concerns open at 07.00.

No. 998-16/53 dated 27th May 1941: when you first made the suggestion I thought it would solve many problems but after consideration I think the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. In the real hot weather it is very still and sticky in the early morning, I know this well because I am always out in the summer before 6-30. If the clock was advanced one hour, or more, it would still be very hot in the late afternoon which is the time when people go out and take exercise. As far as the office is concerned advancing the clock would mean that all the people who come to the office, Shaikhs, merchants etc., would come in the middle of the morning which result in ones morning being more cut up even than it is now - I am considering the idea from my own point of view. Unless the change was adopted by everyone, including the Bahrain Petroleum Company, it would rather complicate the social life of the place.

Kis Britannic Majesty's Political Agent Manama, Bahrein island, Persian Gulf. Dear Sir: I have your circular letter No.D.O.No.1157-16/53 of 18th June requesting an!|ppinion as to whether it would be advisable or practicable to adopt a local zone Time of 3 hours 30 minutes ahead of G. iku T. instead of 3 hours 23 minutes at present in effect. This question is one that came up some years ago when I was employed by Bapco. If I recall correctly, the standard of 3 hours 30 minutes was used prior to Bapco»s arrival in Bahrein and for some yeais afterward but on account of constant confusion was changed to conform with the actual interval. There certainly must have been some veuy good reasons put forth to change the old standard formerly used, and I rather question the practicability of making any further change. When I first read your letter I was inclined to believe it might be a step in the right direction but upon further consideration I am rather apprehensive that it might cause more undue confusion now that the general public is educated to what constitutes the actual interval. On account of this time element being so deep rooted in the minds of everyone and particularily in the Casoc organization, I am quite confident in saying that I think a change at this time would cause more trouble than benefit. a time differential of 3 hours 30 minutes as compared with 3 hours 23 minutes: However, people soon adjust themselves to the actual time differential te tween here and London, especially if they are listeners of the radio. Since the radio news is most important to all of us, I think this factor should also be borne in mind if any time change is contemplated. of Casoc, I do not think a time change is warranted after we have all been educated to the actual interval of time between here and London. I believe only further confusion would result from such a change, and that possible benefits would be greatly offset by the disadvantages irhich would result. I will grant that it is slightly easier to remember May I repeat again that personally, and also on behalf yours respectfully, c.c. Mr. iT. W.

If the Local Authorities at Bahrein such as the Naval Officer-in-Charge, the O.C. Levies, the Oil Companies, Gray Mackenzie and other interested parties find such an idea convenient, then presumably this could be put into effect. In this case, Sharjah would also have to make some alteration in their timings in order to conform. I should be interested to know if you think this is a good idea.

(My dear ttelgrave) Chase of the British Overseas Airways Corporation has suggested that we might advance our decks half an hour and thus be four hours ahead of Greenwich instead of three and a half as at present. 2 . Chased only reason for wanting to alter the time is to save half an hour's daily light at the tail end of the day. fhis is an undoubted advantage for those who do not rise too early, those who do start work soon after six will gain little. 3.
