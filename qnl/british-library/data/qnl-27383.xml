V I have the honour to report that a number of British Indians travelling on Pilgrim Passes issued in India and desiring to return from Iraq, to India via Persia have recently arrived here without the necessary visa from the Persian Consular Authorities in India. Bince the Persian Consular Authorities in this country consistently refuse to give a visa for Persia on a Pilgrim Pass issued in India, these pilgrims have been obliged to obtain from this Consulate regular British passport’s valid for six months only at a cost of Rs.lO/-/~ each, an additional expense which some of them can ill afford* It is observed that while certain pilgrim passes issued at Karachi, Lucknow, Hyderabad Deccan, Hangu etc., bear a printed warning advising pilgrims intend ing to visit Persia of the necessity of having their passes visaed by the Persian Consular Authorities in India, other Pilgrim Passes issued at Bara Banki, Banda, Cawnpore, Unao, Basti, Moradabad, Peshawar, et., do not bear this warning. Seeing that its omission results in inconvenience and hardship to certain pilgrims as explained in paragraph (l) above, I beg to suggest that renewed instructions be addressed to all authorities in India issuing pilgrim Passes emphasizing the necessity for the inclusion of the warning on every pass valid for the journey to Iraq, and Persia.

The hearer had previously travelled on pilgrim pass No. 172 dated 10th ^ril 1950 issued by the Magistrate of Karachi, which is cancelled being insufficient for travelling to Persia.' it was found that the holder was not a bona fide pilgrim but a carpet trader having bean domiciled in Meshed for the last 2C years. Crhulam Haider had on 19th February last proceeded to India on a valid British Passport No. 14 of 25th February 1922 issued by His Britannic Majesty*s Consul General, Hashed. He lost this on the train journey to Karachi somewhere near Hyderabad Bind. In Karachi he was able to get a pilgrim Pass for visiting Kerbela and Meshed. On arrival at Baghdad the abovernontioned passport was issued to him in lieu of the Pilgrim Pass.

I have the honour to state that according to a report received from the Persian Vice Consul at Quetta, the pilgrim passes issued in hehalf of Indian pilgrims proceeding to Persia, are perceived to contain certain defects which confront the Persian Consular Officers with some difficulty at the time issuing visas applied for. In order to obviate this difficulty, I shall be very j grateful if you will kindly instruct the departments concerned to observe the following points when they issue such passes. 1. When sealing the photos attached to the passes, care should be taken to have half the seal on the photo and the other half on the paper. 2.
