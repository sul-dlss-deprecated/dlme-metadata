No Date .... ^ ''CON^RDENTIAL RECORDS Dated the 3rd January 1939, Will you please refer to my demi-official letter No. C/794 dated the 23rd December 1938 in regard to P.C.L. affairs on the Trucial Coast ? 2, Longrigg came in by air to Bahrain yesterday and is returning tomorrow en route to Abu Dhabi once more. He seems to be making a little progress with the Shaikh in regard to a concession, and the latter has reverted to his demand for Kuwait terms (instead of Saudi terms), Longrigg says that they have not got on to the really difficult clauses yet, and in any case he does not intend to stay there more than a fortnight. I have sent you a telegram today (No. 1) asking for authority to give Longrigg a letter on the lines of 'P.C.L. or none' ultimatum. Longrigg senses that Abu Dhabi still has some idea that if he cannot get his terras from P.C.L. he may be able to do so from the Americans, and he thought it was just possible that it might help him immensely if he could have a letter of the type suggested. He would not use it unless necessary. I should have liked to give him a letter there and then but recent correspondence from London is not quite sufficiently definite to enable me to do so. 3. It is almost certain that exploration is off this cold weather. P.C.L. might conceivably make another effort in the Baraimi-Hafit direction if they got their concession from Abu Dhabi, but obviously all that is muoh too hypothetical at/- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushireat the moment for discussion. As for Jehel Faiyah, Longrigg says that Shaikh Khalid is very upset at Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali*s attitude and that no negotiations are going on at pre sent. Longrigg fully accepts our view that Khalid is the only man who will ever be able to get them there. As he seems to be content (or as content as might be expected) to let the proposed Jebel Faiyah exploration slide for the time being, I conceive that it is not my business to attempt to expedite it. But before Longrigg leaves the Gulf for good I propose to try to impress on him the extreme importance of having their plans for next year ready in plenty of time to enable the most dilatory negotiations to be put through before any party wants to set out. V) 4. One more point of interest. Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin Sultan, nephew of the A1 Bu Shamis Shaikh in the Baraimi oasis, has been here, and when I spoke rather bitterly of the opposition of his relatives to the exploration party his reply was: 'Things do not always happen today; but they may happen tomorrow or the next day'. X Yours sincerelygonfidential The Residency, Bushire, tne 9th January, 1939 D* Wo* 30-3• In continuation of my ’Express Letter No,719-S of the 15th December 1938 on the subject of Petroleum Concessions Limited’s exploration in the hinterland, I enclose herewith giving cover to a report by Howes, who accompanied the party as Political Officer* which adds considerably to our knowledge of Baraimi, and which should prove most valuable when Petroleum Concessions Limited make a fresh attempt to explore the interior* In the event of a major war too if enemy agents penetrate to the frucial Coast hinterland, and endeavour to stir up the tribes against us on the True ial Coast (with the object for instance of cutting our Air Route), and against the Sultan of Muscat (as they did in the Great far), any information which we can obtain of the interior is obviously useful. k'Usjwp*iM @ous that is to say to the subject immediately under considera tion - the exploration of Petroleum Concessions Limited. In paragraph III (d) of his report Howes makes a brief mention of slavery in the Baraimi Oasis. That slaves were sold in Baraimi does not come as a surprise, we have had information of to feightman asking for certain further details, and will then R.T.Peel ssquire, M.

The Muscat party sponsored by the Sultan covered a considerable distance before it reacned Baraimi. yf. via the Satineh Coast - Ibri - Yanqul and Jebel Hafit, but as it u ravelled ^airly fas u was able to do little real exploration en route. After having met the Trucial Coast party it returned from Baraimi to Muscat via Sohar to carry out its aerial exploration of the Has al Hadd - Murbat area (see correspondence Trucial Coast party sponsored by the Shaikh of Abu Dhafci went straight up from that place to Baraimi. Thence they proceeded by motor for about 1^ hours south under the auspices of the Wall of cohar (Muscat) when they met the Muscat party. After a day’s work or so on Jebel Hafit they returned to Baraimi with the Muscat party and after abortive negotiations to proceed south wards lasting for some two weeks returned to Abu Dhabi, Their Howes’ paragraph III (b) mentions Howes’ paragraph III (b) mentions that there are a large of rifles and ammunition in the Oasis. Further enquiries ! number of rifles and ammunition in the Oasis J&gt; -1^ . are bdngma.de in this direction. 6 To turn to the actual Petroleum Concessions Limited’s ending with my telegram Ho.379 of the 29th Hovember 1938). The total /«o t'/ -• total stay in the BaXaimi area was about three weeks* 7* Teightman and Howes between them give detailed reasons for the failure of the exploration. Broadly speaking I think these were as follows. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi lays claim to a part of Baraimi, and wields considerable influence there. The Sultan of Muscat is in a similar position. But neither of these potentates can wield either full suzerainty, or full influence, over the whole of the Oasis. There was therefore a clash of interests between these two potentates, each sponsoring one of the parties, on the other hand if it had not been for the Sultan being first in the field with his promise to get his party into Baraimi, I doubt whether the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi would ever have assisted the party to go &lt; through his territory. The latter’s attitude on this point until he heard that the sultan was sponsoring a party was that of obstinate refusal. On hearing this news, however, his natural reaction must have been that if he left the field clear to the Sultan’s party his own claim to Baraimi might, in our view, go by default - at any rate to some extent. I have no doubt whatever therefore that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi gave confidential instructions to his representative, who accompanied the Trucial Coast party, that he was to take then to Baraimi, but after that to allow them to move about as little as possible. 3. Besides the Cultan of Muscat and the Shaikh of Abu Vari0U8 Shaikhs of local tribes (see Appendix jII of Howes’ report). Some of these acknowledge the influence of the sultan, and some that of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, while * others / : »\4 others appear to be independent of both. Some of these local elements are almost incredibly primitive (vide paragraph III (e) of Howes* report), and all are imbued with the innate sus picion and fear which all ttibal elements have of European visits, which they look upon in the light of visitations leading to the loss of their independence, which in point of fact has quite often followed. Such fears and suspicions are generally must in evidence in the early contacts with European visitors, whether official or unofficial, end in the present instance though petroleum Concessions Limited’s geologists had paid a short visit to Baraimi in Hay 1937 they did not succeed in reaching some of the areas visited by the present parties. Howes is therefore substantially correct in saying (vide para- ^ ft graph III (e) of his report) tnat no European has been to Baraimi since Cox’s visit in 1905, and of course no party at all on the scale of the present parties has ever visited Baraimi. The attitude of the local tribes tov7ards these parties is best summed up in the words of seme elders quoted by Howes in an earlier report: * We don’t want your oil, we don’t want your money, we don’t like your cars. We’re quite content with our camels, our dates, and our old way of life.” It is possibly inevitable that the old way of life in the hinterland may have to pass, as it has in all Arab lands, but in the meantime the attitude of the local tribes is quite a reasonable one which claims a good deal of one’s sympathy. If I had, in order to account for the failure of the exploration, to pick on one main cause underlying the welter of intrigue, and play of personalities of Shaikhs and others, described by Weightman and Howes, I should choose the psychological factor of this local fear and suspicion. The reasons for the failure of /1 -5- of the exploration in the Beni Kitab country are given in paragraph 4 of feightman*a letter, 9® Amongst the more specific causes mentioned by feightman for the non-success of the exploration is the failure of the Company to distribute adequate monetary presents (see paragraph 3 (ii) of his letter). On this point Weightman writes: H They (the local tribes) therefore made excuses for not conducting the second party through their territories, and the only inducement which might have been effective, namely immediate Payments on a large scale, was not forthcoming, I confess that I had originally thought that once the company’s geologists were in touch with the and the a! Bu Shamis Shaikhs they would be able to travel without undue difficulty in their territories, but I had anticipated that adequate induce ment would be offered to them,* It is true that the sum of Ra.50,000/- asked by the Beni TCa’ab for permission to explore ( paragraph IV of Howes’ report) was exhorbitant, but the sum that the party had to pay for one day’s work at Jebel Hafit Rs,70/- (see the same paragraph of Howes* report) though large was not out of all proportion to the end in view, Longrigg has always laid stress on the fact that the Company’s parties, if once we got tnem into the hinterland, would buy way from place to place from the local Shaikhs, and he gave us to understand that the actual period which the party would want to stay in any one place for purpose of a preliminary exploration would not be more than say four or five days. For this period the total, even at Rs.70/- per diem, in any one area would not work out at more than say Rs,400 - which in /in comparison with the issues at stake, and the large sums whioh the Company are prepared to pay for their concessions, is x not excessive* If the party had been prepared to pay out in cash up to say Bs.4000/~ - not a large sun - to the minor local Shaikhs it seems to me that they might have been able to do s omewhat mor e exp 1 or at i on » 10* With regard to the presence of a Political Officer with ^ ill's t&amp;'S l the Trucial Coast party, Weight men in another letter gives the following opinion based on reports from Howes* i 'The Trucial Coast party might quite well have found themselves unable to move even from Abu Dhabi to Baraimi but for his own presence with them as representative of (Bahrain) the Political Agent^hom the Shaikh had promised to conduct apywhere he chose to go in Abu Dhabi territory* Similarly the party’s stay in B&amp;raimi would probably have been very much shorter,' I quite concur* Further, I have no doubt that the presence of a Political Officer with the party was a distinct asset in ensuring that though it met with obstruction at any rate no act of open hostility was displayed against it, A most important consideration* ll* Even though Petroleum Concessions Limited’s venture to Baraimi has been a failure from the point of view of actual exploration I am certainly not of opinion that it has been wasted* Briefly, as in previous cases of opening up of the Trucial Coast, the ice has been broken. There is indeed nothing new or particularly surprising in the opposition at present displayed towards oil exploration. All phases of the-opening up cf the Trucial Coast which have taken place during the lastten years or so have met, in their initial stages, with the same difficulties c Nowadays for example we take the Air Route along the Trucial Coast for granted, but I can remember only some 8 years ago that when this scheme was first mooted the opposition to it amongst the coastal Shaikhs was even stronger than that now shown against oil exploration in the interior, and the welter of local intrigue that went on was even greater® A definite anti-air combine was formed by the Shaikhs by which each bound himself not to grant any facilities in his area, the underlying cause of this opposition being precisely the same as that against oil exploration - a fear by the Shaikhs and their people of encroachments on their territories and their liberties# It took my predecessor «* Biscoe — many months of hard and patient negotiations to break down this opposition, and persuade the Shaikh of Sharjah to leave the combine and give the facilities required# The Shaikh finally did this only with the utmost reluctance, and with considerable apprehension that in doing so he was risking his toaikhship and his life - either at the hands of his own people or of the neighbouring Shaikhs# As time passed, however, and the Trucial Coast saw that we made no attempt on the basis of our air facilities to impose a close administration or closer control on Sharjah, local public opinion completely veered round, and before very long the Shaikh of Debai, seeing the considerable financial advantages which Sharjah was obtaining in return for facilities which he had given, was actually asking us if we could not move our air port from Sharjah to Debai J I have no doubt that in the end we shall get our -oil facilit ies*,i. e# full exploration in the inter!or,in the same way that we got our air facilities. The10 - 8 - faot that two parties of Petroleum Concessions Limited have actually penetrated to Baraimi, have moved about to the limited extent possible* have made contacts with the local Shaikhs and have been able to withdraw without any hostile demonstration being made against them, is much to the good» #e have also acquired valuable information as to local personalities, conditions and the particular difficulties to be overcome. All this should assist us materially when the second attempt of Petroleum Concessions Limited for exploring the hinterland is made» 12« Another advantage which we have gained by the present expedition seems to me that it provides a reply to the American oil interests in case they should propose exploring the interior^ If we had sent no party into the interior they might have argued that we were adopting a dog in the manger attitude, i^e* tb&amp;t while making no effort to explore the interior ourselves we prevented them from doing so* The fact that parties of petroleum Concessions Limited have actually visited the hinterland provides a good answer to any such argument* 13* In regard to when the second attempt at Petroleum Concessions Limited exploration should be made, Weightman — P ' fb Si * in his paragraph 5 says that Longrigg’s present feeling is that all hopes this year of ground exploration must be abandon ed* I am inclined to agree, and to be of the opinion that we had better let the hinterland settle down after the recent Petroleum Concession Limited’s visit and postpone any further exploration until the autumn of this year. This applies fcnly to /II to ground exploration* There is no reason why the Company» when they have finished their Has al Hadd - Mur bat aerial survey, should not make a similar survey of, at any rate part of, the hinterland* Whether they oan do this, and to what extent, will have to be considered later.* 14.

On 15th December Mr.Xongrigg, General Manager, arrived in Muscat from Sharjah. He saw the geologists Messrs Thompson and Hotchkiss and after discussing various matters with them left for oharjah by aic the same day, his length of stay in Muscat being some three hours. On 18th December the geological party left for Has al Hadd by motor- dhow to meet the Company* s aeroplane which, it is understood, arrived there the same day. On 23rd December the motor dhow returned to Muscat for stores and left again the same day for Ras al Hadd. On 25tii December the geological party returned by motor dhow to Muscat, the aeroplane having proceeded to Sharjah, it seems, a day or two previously. It appears that for four days a series of survey flights was carried —-—— {Signature) out i h' • “ S. 44. {Designation) MFP—985 S&amp;P—(M-1597)—27 11-36—10,000.- 2 - out into the interior from the base camp at Has al Hadd. It has not yet been ascertained why reconnaissances further to the south i.e. from Masirah, Khor Gharim,Shuv/ai- miyah and Murhat as originally planned were not carried out. An unconfirmed report received states that the Sheikh of masirah refused to allow the Company’s aeroplane to use the landing ground on that island and tore up the Sultan’s letter of introduction which had been sent him. Personally I do not believe this report to be true. V^rWvt tr u V/ri dp f &gt; v’J According to the Company’s local agents however the . .. ^ • n , mT -, r , TTir - 1 . rv _ ' ■*' real reason for the postponement of the flights to the south ern portion of the Sultanate was that it was found that the motor dhow hired as a tender vessel was unsuitable for the purpose. It is believed that a Tanker will be hired for the work in place of the dhow. On December 26th the Company’s aeroplane arrived in Muscat from Sharjah. On December 27th the Company’s Arabic Interpreter Khan Sahib Hasan bin Saleh Jaafar came to the Agency and asked the assistance of the Treasury Officer in obtaining permission from the Sultan’s Represen tative for the aeroplane to fly over the Batinah which, he stated, had been refused. The Treasury Officer accordingly went and interviewed Saiyid Shahab on the matter, who in formed him that he had refused permission not for a flight over tie Batinah, as stated, but over the Oman. This per mission he declared he could not give, firstly because the Sultan had given him no instructions on the subject and secondly because it would be a dangerous undertaking the responsibility for the possible consequences of which he, Saiyid Shahab, was not prepared to assume. Meanwhile,it seems,without waiting to hear the decision of the Sultan’s Representative the aeroplane, in which Mr. Thompson, senior geologist and a photographer named Mr. Eden were tie passengers, took off from the landing ground and carried out a flight of some two hours duration into theinto the interior. This no doubt took them well over the Oman. On December 27th Mr. Hotchkiss, geologist, a mechanic from the aeroplane and Khan Sahib Hasan bin Salih left for Sharjah by the Up Mail steamer and Mr. Thompson the and Mr. Eden followed by aeroplane^/next day. It is understood that the geologists intend to return to Muscat to discuss their future plans with the Sultan on His Highness’s return this month about 13th instant. 4» This report has been compiled from information obtained with some difficulty by the Treasury Officer (during my absence from Muscat from 9th December to 1st January) , partly from the members of the geological party and partly from other sources. It appears that the Company is not keeping this Agency or the Muscat Government fully informed of their plans and proposed movements in the Sultanate. That such intormation should be always given is of course of real importance and you might perhaps care to remind /Y**- Longrigg of his obligations in this respect . s Maj or, I.A.

Mr. Thompson, senior geologist, of the Muscat section of Petroleum Concessions exploratory parties, returned to Muscat by the Down Slow Mail steamer on 6th fiKaLHMkxx January and came to see I me the same day. He informed me unofficially and confidentially that as a result of his observations during the series of flights carried out by the Company’s aeroplane from Kas-al-Hadd, both along hie coast and into the interior, he was personally convinced that tne possibi lity of finding oil in the districts seen could be entirely ruled out. The same position would apply, he added, to the wnole ox hie terri tory extending from hie coast line to the western limits ox the Sultanate between the limits of Ras-alPHadd and the commencement of the province of Dhofar, all of which was of a similar geological nature. Mr. Thompson gave me to understand that he had reported his opinion to the Head Office of his Company who were certain to agree with his viev/s and that it could be assumed that no further aerial surveys would be carried out over the area in question. 3* Should Mr. Thompson’s assumption be correct and the Company in fa ct {Signature) S. 44.

The scheme apparently is to convey stores, supplies and personnel to Murbat from Muscat in a West Bound Tanker which will not remain at that port but X^roceed to whatever its destination may be. On the comple tion of the survey evacuation of the temporary base to Muscat will be carried out by a Tanker bound for Abadan. The Com panies aeroplane will of course fly to Murbat. Actual details of the exploratory work to be carried out are to be discussed by the geologists with Hie Sultan on Hie latter’s return to Muscat on 13th of this month. 5 , I can see no objection to that item in Hie pro- posed scheme of exploration of Dhofar whereby no steamer or ship will be used to remain the whole time at Murbat. The Company’s party will be in wireless communication with the Royal Air Force Station at Muscat, Dhofar province is peace ful and the inhabitants law-abiding and docile and in the event of a forced landing of the aeroplane in Hie interior the Sultan has more than once stated to me that he could in that district arrange for a rescue party to be despatched Il« 'f***#*-' -• -'••• - - ' from- 3 13 from Murbat or Salalab. Mr. Thompson confirmed that on December 27th he had carried out a flight over the Oman&gt; &amp;o a distance* according to him, of nearly 200 miles inland. I pointed out to Air. Thompson that as he had, quite correctly, sent nis Interpreter beforehand to the Sultan's .Representative to ask permission for this flight he should undoubtedly have waited for a reply before actually making it. Such acts, I a,dded, were not con ducive to promote cordial relations between the Company and the Sultan's Government. Mr. Thompson's reply to my remarks were was somewhat evasive. 8. On 8th January, the Company's aeroplane in which Mr. Hotchkiss geologists and Mr. Eden photographer were passengers, arrived in Muscat from Sharjah and returned the following day. The object of their visit it is understood was to obtain a fresh supply of photographic material (from the stock kept at Muscat for use in the Trucial Coast district. 9 . i understand that Mr. Baker, the Head Geologist in the hondon Office, of Petroleum Concessions Limited, is shortly due out in the Gulf on a tour of inspection of the work done by the Company's geologists.

In the everu, of a forced landing in that region, therefore, His Highness continued, the chances of the occupants of the machine ever emerging alive were exceedingly remote. Rescue parties would and could be sent out in the event of the aeroplane not returning to its ba.se by a stipulated time but with nothing to guide them it would be a case of finding a needle in a haystack and, should it be found, it would probcibly by that time be too late. A forced landing the Sultan concluded would in all probability mean absolute disaster. He was not prepared ; he said^to send a Representative in the aeroplane as he would be of no use to the party if they v/ere forced down. Mr. Thompson said he fully understood the situation and the risks attendant on such a flight and was prepared as Head of the Muscat section of Petroleum Concessions Ltd # s exploration party to ac :-ept the consequences. Th^iachine used by the Company was a 4 engined one and he had absolute confidence in its relaibility. 5 . Mr. Thompson stated that his Company had now arranged for a Tanker belonging to the .‘British Tanker Company to transport stores and supplies from Muscat to Dhofar on a westward passage from the Gulf and similarly for the return to Muscat for their base camp to be conveyed by a Gulf bound Tanker Y/hen the work in that province had been completed.-3- &gt;§ How that the Sultan had informed, him that his party could proceed for the survey of Dhofar Mr* Thompson stated thai^he would telegraph for a Tanker to call in at Muscat as early as possible. 6 . The Sultan pointed out to Mr. Thompson that his action in carrying out a flight over the Oman (vide paragraph 3 of My Express Letter quoted above) was not in order since he had clearly explained in my presence to Mr. Longrigg in October last year that that part of his territories was,for various reasons, unsuitable for aerial surveys. Mr. Thompson replied that he had. been informed by Mr. Longrigg personally on his arrival in Muscat on November 1st last year that all arrangements had been made by him with the Sultan for the Company’s aeroplane to fly anywhere it might be Be desired over the Sultanate. His Highness in reply stated that so far from joeing the case he had agreed only for the aeroplane* to fly from Sharjah down along the coast to Rass-al-Kadd and thence carry out aerial surveys into the interior and along the coast as £ar as theVlimits of Lhofar. The Sultan appealed to me to corroborate him which I did, his statements being • of course perfectly correct. Mr. Longrigg had expressly stated that his Sompany’s aeroplane would, not land at Muscat whereas it had done so on December 15th and several other occasions without previous intimation and permission being obtained from his Representative while the Sultan was away at Dhofar. Failure to keep him and his Government fully informed of the Company’s change nrarr.-rf rt fr'T- -r ^ •- •••• of plans caused considerable inconvenience, the Sultan went on th say, and was against the promise given by Br Longrigg and he desired that the Company’s Representatives should be careful to observe the arrangements made in this connection in the futiu eX / s Mr. Thompson expressed regret if he had in any way annoyed the Sultan through his failure to observe undertakings given by his Company and promised to .keep the Muscat Government fully informed in wftfrting in the future concerning all his plans. 7. Mr. Thompson stated that a part of the special earnera used for taking photographs in the aerial survey required replacing. He therefore proposed to fly to Sharjah on 17th January to obtain the spare part from the Co:mpany f s store and return to Muscat in the course of a few days. Meanwhile he would^to Abadan for the first available Tanker to be sent to Muscat to convey stores etc. to Dhofar to commence the survey work there. He hoped kH a Ta nker would be made available within the next 10-14 days* 8 . So far as the Company's present plans for ground work to be carried out in Dhofar are concerned 1 do not anticipate trouble of any sort. The province is under effective control and the inhabitants friendly and social. The proposed flight over a portion of the Great Bands is another matter. However the Company aeroplane, is as Mr- Thompson mentioned, a reliable 4 engined one and the chances of a forced landing extremely remote. The probable consequences of such an occurrence have been forcibly put to Mr. Thompson by the Sultan and as the forti^is prepared to take the risk ? presumably with the knowledge and approval of his Company f it seems, that no further action on our part is called /? ^ Major, I.A., Political .Agent 8c H.B.M's Consul, MuscatM GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

If all other things were equals we should like to do the following ^1. A detailed geological examination on the ground along the western side of the Oman range extending from the Persian Gulf on the north to the vicinity of Ibri and from the mountains westward to the sand-covered area. This embraces detailed mapping of the Yaiyah, Podha, Aqdar ? Hafit and Ibri structures located within the above area occupied by the Beni Kaab ; Beni kitab ; jJa 5 im and A1 bu Shamis tribes.

A reconnaissance geological' examination on the ground of the area bounded approximately by the lattitude of Dhank-Muscat on the norths parallel 22 degrees north lattitude on the south ? the sand-covered area on the west and the Oman mountain front on the east. 4. Additional geological and possibly geophysical surveys along the Gulf of Oman coast; northwest of Muscat. 5.

We shall not be surprised if you tell us that some parts of the areas above specified must still remain out of bounds ? but hope very much that this will not a'ply to the interesting structures mentioned in item (l). It is to be remembered that our not very successful efforts to penetrate that area in November; 1933 were made before we had obtained a concession from the Shaikh of Abu Dho.oi ? whose good offices we shall hope to enjoy this year 3 instead of his opposition.

We have now succeeded in extracting a broad outline of what the Company would like to do M if all other things were equal**. It is an immense programme, covering practically the whole area from the base of the Qatar Peninsula to the south coast, and I cannot help feeling that the Company will be considerably taken aback if they are told that the whole thing, from the political point of view, is perfectly feasible t It is however evident that having obtained their rough outline we must now extract from them their detailed plans. The portion with which I am concerned is contained in items 1 and 2 in Longrigg*s letter, though for reasons which will appear below I am indirectly concerned to some extent with items 3 and 5. 3. To dispose of item 2 first. Practically the whole of this area is covered by the Abu Dhabi State, though the eastern part of it presumably takes in an area under Na*im and A1 Bu Shamis occupation. The Company having obtained a concession from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi there need be no difficulty about arranging a geophysical survey there, the south-eastern and southern limits of which might reasonably extend to the Riyadh line. It would be advisable, I suggest, for the Company to avoid A The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.- 2 - i ■ } A &lt;0 avoid the vicinity of Khor al O&amp;eid in spite of the views which we hold in regard to its ownership; they will find quite enough to do if they start 20 miles to the south-east of this Khor. I presume that the survey will he by the new gravitymeter method (I am not quite sure how it works, but this method enables large tracts of desert area to be covered in a comparatively short space of time for the purpose of selecting specific areas where closer work can be done, e.g. by seismograph). Subject to the remarks made above, there will, I suggest, be no need for us to intervene in the dis cussions with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi which the Company's own representative can conduct on the basis of the concession. 4. To turn now to item 1. Last winter we could do nothing with the Beni Kitab, and the Company effected their contacts with the Beni Ka'ab, the Fa'im and the Al Bu Shamis through the Sultan of Muscat's Wali at Sohar. It is needless to re capitulate the reasons for the failure of last year's attemot, ~ h*3- which are summarised in your demi-official letter No• 30-3 dated the 9th January 1939 to Peel and its enclosures. This year I strongly advise that the approach to the Na' im and Al Bu Shamis should be via the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and his rep resentative in the Baraimi Oasis. Direct contacts might be established in one of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi's villages in the Baraimi Oasis between the Company's representative (pre sumably Lermitte) and the tribal Shaikhs concerned - in parti cular with Mohammad bin Bahmah of the Jebel Hafit Al Bu Shamis. There must of course be some money showing and promises of more on completion of the survey. 5. It is however not impossible that such a procedure might cost the Company a certain amount of good will with the Sultan of Muscat, and I can only suggest that this difficulty be obviated by giving Muscat so much to do in conducting /«7/- ro -3- A conducting other parties further to the south-east (cf. items . 3, 4 and 5 in Longrigg*s letter) that the Sultan of Muscat may disregard the Company 1 s method of approach to the Na r im, A1 Bu Shamis and the Beni Ka’ab. But for this to be effective, it seems to me essential that there must be a ”no man r s land” , -i-Mnwu -i-m, .| W .| i 11 iTi iHm i i ' | betv/een the fields of activity of the predominantly Trucial ' „ ' ■I' ■mi i.nin - MT rrr--Wiiiii.iai^Wi&lt;wlM’I'lll Mil i&lt; Coast party and the predominantly Muscat party. This vacuum might be taken on a line running roughly south from the western end of the Wadi Jizzi (leaving Hail and all towns in the Wadi on the Muscat side) to Fida (leaving Fida, Dot and Dhank to the Trucial Coast); then bearing south-south-west to include Jebel Khatam, which is roughly south of Dhank, and the Aflaj Beni Kitab in the Trucial Coast area. I regard it as a matter of great importance, juding by the experience of last winter, that no attempt should be made for the Muscat and Trucial Coast parties to overlap or even to meet. 6. As for Jebel Faiyah and the Beni Kitab, as I have said in my demi-official letter No. C/249 dated the 15th April 1939, Shaikh Khalid of Kalba seems hopeful about negotiations with Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali. If I can make arrangements with the Senior Naval Officer for a Trucial Coast cruise this year, and ’ the signs seem hopeful, I should expect to include a visit to Kalba, and Shaikh Khalid himself talks of inviting Mohammad bin Ali in at that time in order to meet me. If this comes off Lermitte might hold himself ready to proceed at once to Kalba by launch on receipt of a signal from me, ready to complete negotiations with Mohammad bin Ali and Shaikh Khalid. Alterna tively we may be able to arrange a meeting elsewhere and I request authority to advise the Company's representative at once on my own responsibility if at any time the possibility occurs of a meeting being arranged, e.g. at Dhaid or elsewhere, so long as no possible danger is involved. I feel that the Beni Ka'ab should be approached through Shaikh Khalid and Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali.-X^ A I -4- 7. I trust the Company can be induced either to authorise Lermitte to carry through all negotiations on their behalf or to send some more senior employee out in May or June for this purpose; and also to indicate provisionally the personnel of their various parties and the dates when each will set out* Extract from letter flo•C/249 of 15th April 1939 from Mr.H*Weightman, Political Agent, Bahrain, to Sir Trenchard Eowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Since in certain cases ^a) and (b) overlap tne most convenient general z j } \ method of approach would be for the Company* s representative to deal first with (a) and then for the same representative, who will be fully conversant with all details of the problem from the Trucial / Coast {Signature) S. 44. MFP— 1048 S&amp;P— (M-2042)—17-12-37—20,000. (Designation)- 2 - sif Coast aspect, to proceed to Muscat and negotiate with the Sultan over (b). It is true that there is no question of overlapping in certain areas which are definitely Muscat, If however the question of explora tion is once raised with the Sultan he will most probably raise the awkward question of the overlapping areas. Should, however, the frueial Coast negotiations be prolonged time may not permit of this procedure and a second representative will have to be sent to Muscat to carry out concurrent negotiations. 3. After consultation with the Political Agent, Bahrain, I am of the following opinion. 4. (l) fhe geographical area 1 indicated by the Company, which is the most important from their point of view, can be divided into two spheres from the political point of view (a) that of the Beni Xitab and the Beni Ka’ab tribes. These tribes can best be approached through Shaikh Khalid, Regent of Kalba . (b) that of the Maim and a! Bu Bhamis tribes. These should be approached through the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. Xast year the tribes under (b) (and the Beni Ka* ab) were approached through the Sultan of Muscat, who claimed that they were under his suzerainty, but with little result, xnis year we will try the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, since he n a s given the Company a concession in his territory he may be expected / to(g -3- to be helpful Instead of obstructive, as he was last year. (2) In connection with the rival claims of muscat and Abu nhabi, and any other such claims of suzerainty tr.at may arise between Shaikhs, it »ust not be forgotten that our policy, as approved of by His Majesty's Government, is as indicated in 7 and 8 of my Mote dated* tlie 25th October 1937 to the India Office (copy sent to the Government of India and Political ^gent, Bahrain, under Residency Printed Letter || . to?? * Ho*c/316, dated the 24th November 1937. A copy of these para graphs is now being sent to the Political Agent , Muscat). Briefly that our dealings with a particular Shaikh in order to secure exploration of a particular area by the Company do not imply a recognition by us that this area belongs to that Shaikh* If necessary this could be explained to the sultan of Muscat and to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, but it would probably be better, if possible, to avoid giving this explanation. (3) The Company should forthwith authorise a representa tive (either one who is already in Bahrain or one deputed from elsewhere for the purpose), after consultation with the Political Agent, Bahrain, to proceed to the frucial Coast, and there, if necessary with the assistance of the Residency Agent, to make the approaches indicated in (1) above, keeping the Political Agent, Bahrain, informed of the progress of negotia tions. The Company should be prepared to begin their explora tion on the 1st of October, when the result of these negotia tions is known detailed plans in regard to area 1 can be formed. It is essential however that the Company should authorise their representative to proceed to the frucial Coast as soon as possible. Area 2. This should offer no difficulties but the / geophysicalSt *» ^ •• geopiiysical party should avoid the vicinity of Xhor al Odeid. The corapany’s representative mentioned above should discuss plans for this area also with the shaikhs of Q^atar and Abu Dhabi after consultation with the political Agent* Bahrain. 6. Area 3. The north-western part of tiiis overlaps area 1, and the rest is under Muscat* with regard to trie former, this should be included in conversations on area 1* Should the Sultan of Muscat claim the Sorth-.western part the same explanation can be given him as in paragraph 4 (2) above. With regard to the rest of the area, at some siege an approach will have to be made to the sultan. In this connection see my para graph 2 above 7. Area 4. This is entirely in Muscat controlled territory and should offer no difficulty. Here again an approach to the Sultan might be postponed until the fractal Coast negotiations are finished (see my paragraph 2 above). 8. Area 5. This while nominally in Muscat territory is under the effective control of the Imam., and not tne sultan. Approach to the Sultan could be postponed for the present as explained in my paragraph 2 above. 9* Area 6. Flights over area 3. It is presumed that these flights will be based on Muscat aerodrome. Approach to the Sultan could be postponed for the present as explained in para graph 2 above. 10. Area *7. Flights along the south Coast of Muscat. This should offer no difficulty. Approach to the Sultan could be postponed for the present as explained in paragraph 2 above. / u. / f ■ jgmq in whatever areas the parties work, they should carry a sufficient supply of money with them, and have authority from tne Company to spend reasonably generous sums to Shaikhs and others for local services and assistance rendered.

Last winter he arranged for a party of geologists to travel irom Muscat £© vis Ibri, Yankul, and Jabal Hafit to Braimi. Unfortunately «the hasty nature of the journey* precluded the party from making a proper examination of the route they followed. I cannot find a record of why the journey was 'hasty” but possibly the geologists who were of the party have made some report which I have not had* This ye^r s. siiiiilar / party could The Hon*ble Lieut-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle,h.C.I.E.,C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.party could 'be taken at a more leisurely rate over the same route and probably complete the Jabal Hafit exploration.

Hickiribotham, O.B.E*, Political Agent &amp; Consul, Muscat on an interview with His Highness the Sultan of Muscat on the 8th June 1939. u 2. His Highness the Sultan said he was having a really busy time as he had Sagr bin Sultan, the Naim, the Sheikh of the A1 Bu Shamis and Ahmad As Saif, the Jabel Hafit Naim, in his house. They had arrived yesterday to see him. I explained that I had asked for this interview in order to discuss Petroleum Concessions Limited's plans for the winter. I said, as he knew, I had come specially back from Gwadur to see him but on my arrival yesterday I discovered that Petroleum Concessions' representative was proposing to go to Sohar in the hope of meeting him there and as I had no idea that he was proposing to leave Muscat I had now come to ask him if he did intend to go to Sohar or not for if he was not going there it was quite useless Petroleum Concessions' representative going there to meet him. The Sultan said that he had no intention of going to Sohar. Sometime ago the Naim and the A1 Bu Shamis Sheikhs said they would like to come to Muscat to see him and he had put them off and said '*1 will see you when I come to SoharThey had again asked through his Wali at Sohar when he was going to Sohar and he had replied 'after I&lt; return from Dhofar'. Further letters had elicited the answer 'after I return from Gwadur'. His Highness said that it had certainly not been his intention to go to Sohar at this, the hottest, time of the year'. He did not believe in interviewing people till he was ready to use them as if you gave them time to think they always made difficulties which were hard to overcome. A few days ago his Wali at Sohar had written that the A1 Bu Shamis had arrived and was / proposingproposing to come in and see him in Muscat. He had at once written and told the Wali to disuade the Sheikh from coming to Muscat and to put him off by saying that he would let him know when he was coming to Sohar. (I think nis Highness was thinking of his pocket). The Wali replied that the A1 Bu S ha mis insisted on coming to Muscat and that the two'Naim” Shei™s^ , also .^L^P eared * He &gt; the Sultan, immediately sent a car for them. They have had lengthy discussions and, His Highness sard, had expressed their loyalty to him and their willingness r ' .i.nutulTtmrWHniniiiiiim. .n. r 1it»r t0 fo:Llow his directions. I said I thought that if Petroleum Concessions Limited kskk wished to discuss their programme then now was the time and Muscat the place.

His Highness added that he had arranged* at their request, a year's truce between the A1 Bu Shamis Sheikh and Sagr bin Sultan of the Haim.

The Hon*!!© the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. T Sir, jr I have the honour to .yt’ef er to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 130 dated the 19th June 1939 and to enclose a copy of telegram dated the 19th June despatched by Mr. Lermitte to Petroleum Concessions Limited togetner with copies of letters that have passed between His Highness the Sultan and Mr. Lermitte. 2 * Letter 'A' of June the 19th from Mr. Lermitte to His Highness was modified at the request of the Sultan and para graphs 3 (f) and (g) altered to the form in which they appear in letter 'B'. The Sultan’s letter No. 193 dated June the 20th is in reply to letter ’’B’’ of June 19th from Mr. Lermitte. I do not consider that the alterations referred to in paragraph 2 above are of great importance. The original version of paragraph 3 (f) (letter !, A”) implied that the Sheikhs of the A1 Bu Shamis and the Naim would remain constantly with the party. The rendering in letter ”B” is more general. It was unlikely that these two Sheikhs in practice would be v/ith the Geologists throughout their wander ings and possibly undesirable that they should enter each other’s territory and the territory of the neighbouring / 1 %l\) / Sheikhs2 Sheikhs. The Sultan has agreed to arrange for the necessary Sheikhs to accompany the party and in my opinion that is reasonable and sufficient. His Highness is willing to allow Petroleum Concess ions Limited’s Geological party access to the areas enumerated in Mr. Lermitte’s letter {t B” of June 19th. I consider that His Highness is capable of ensuring that the Geologists have complete freedom of movement provided they conduct themselves in a discreet manner and take the advice of the Wali Madhaffer who will be constantly with the party. In my opinion it is both unnecessary and undesirable for the Company to re-open their negotiations with the A1 Bu Shamis and the Haim through the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Sultan has stated that motor cars must not be rt.W&amp;SSKSSK***' used. The reason tnat he has given is that he cannot , autumn guarantee safety if the party are able to move rapidly over a Wide area# The concern He feels is not from the tribesmen under the control of the local Sheikhs in whose territory the party may be operating but from stray bedouins who might fire a shot at a car possibly more in fright or fear than in anger. I understand that His Highness contemplates constructing motor transport in these regions. Next year cars will probably be possible. In view of His Highness’s objection and statement there can be no question of the Company making use of cars. 6. His Highness has further objected to the Geological T u , - . 1 I L K ^ p artgr entering through the territory of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. He considers that the local inhabitants will assume that any party entering through Abu Dhabi must necessarily be entering under the auspices of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The local people in these remote places are very simple and I consider that His Highness is correct in his view. That the / party shoulda A Ifc .. M party should be connected with Abu Dhabi is undesirable for two t l immmm**-;- l irr — i firim i im » |WI11 lr ~ t ' ' - reasons. Firstly because some if not all of the minor Sheilchs living in Muscat territory will probably refuse access to the party on the grounds that it cannot be a Muscat party coming from that direction. No doubt in time entry will be arranged but aggravating delays will occur* Secondly, from His High ness's own personal political point of view it is undesirable for there to be any doubt in the minds of his Sheikhs near and far regarding his overlordship of the Al^Bu Shamis, Naim and the adjacent areas. A party entering from the Batinah side undoubtedly shows that it goes writh his permission. A party entering from the Trucial Coast side may or may not have his permission. I repeat what I have already stated in my telegram under reference and that is that if the party wish to have the least possible trouble they should be guided by His Highness's advice on this point. 7. At this point I should like to mention that in view of the possibility of a repetition of last year's incidents, I consider that the Muscat party should have nothing to do with ^^-.^ i*****™*#*^^***™^^***^^ ***^ any party operating in any territory outside Muscat and vice . . -...■i.:’ •• ’ versa. The Sultan wishes the party operating in Muscat territory to be clearly under his auspices and protection. He does not wish there to be any confusion on this point and for this reason he does not desire a political officer to accompany the party. There are reasons for and against the inclusion of a political officer and I have discussed the question with the Sultan at some length and will if you desire forward a separate report on this point. 8* I believe that Jebel Akhdar will be open to the —— inimnomm I, min' ~ Company's survey parties next winter. His Highness's political influence has spread very considerably during the last few / months m4 months. There are already indications that Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamyar, the paramont Sheikh of Jebel Akhdar, is not unmoved by the Sultan's present policy and it is probable that in the near future His Highness will be able to come more closely into touch with this important Sheikh. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, Captain,I.A., Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. tti.cfov? fCopy of letter dated the 19th June 1939 from Mr. B.H. Lermitte, Petroleum Development (Oman &amp; Dhofar) Limited, Muscat to His Highness Sayid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman. I have the honour to enumerate below the points discuss ed in our talks yesterday and the decisions taken by Your Highness which I shall be greatly obliged if you will confirm to me by letter. 1. If motor transport was to be used in the area to be visited Your Highness could not at this stage guarantee the safety of the party ov/ing to the presence of unsettled bedouin who were not under the control of the local Sheikhs. 2. The local Sheikhs and the people under their control would have no objection to the use of motor transport. 3. Your Highness is willing to allow a geological party to go into the areas to be visited by means of camel transport. (a). i t would be advisable for the party to enter by Muscat territory. b. If the party entered through Baraimi there is the danger that the same situation will arise as last season. c. A party entering through Muscat or other coastal town would be recognised as being under the auspices of the Muscat Government and would therefore not be hindered. d. The area which could be visited includes : Batinah Dhahirah Baraimi Mahadhah which includes „ the country of the Naim, A1 Bu Shamis, Banni Ka'ab and Banni Chittab. e. Freedom of movement and guarantee of security within these areas would be given as far as is humanly possible. f. Wali Mudhaffar would accompany the party throughout and Your Highness would also instruct the Sheikhs of the / Naim and- 2 - )t Naim and AX Bu Shamis also to be with the party. The Sheikh of the Banni Ka’ab v/ould also be instructed to accompany the party if this were necessary. Other Sheikhs en route would join the party and remain v/ith them whilst the party was in their territory. g.Your Highness vrould accompany the party on the first stage of their journey from Muscat. t 4. Your Highness visualises no restriction in the party’s move ments within the following limits From Murair on the coast the line runs due west. From a point just West of the North of Jabal Samaini the line runs due South and includes the v/hole of Jabal Samaini The line bears slightly westward until it arrives at Baraimi and includes Jabal Khadra, Jabal Mahadhah and all other Jabals to the East of this line. From Baraimi the line runs due South and includes the whole of Jabal Hafit. The line continues South until the 'Ibri parallel is reached. From this point due West of ’Ibri the line runs due East until ’Ibri town is reached which is included. From ‘Ibri the line follows the Wadi Hawasinah to the coast at Khaburah including the towns of Dariz,Arid and Miskin. Included in these boundaries are the towns of Dhank, Fida, Dut, Yankul and the Aflaj Banni Chittab. 5. Your Highness mentioned that the Wadis leading to the coast would be examined with the idea of finding a way in land for cars. If a way was found, or could be made, cars would be sent inland by Your Highness in order to familiarise the hinter land inhabitants with motor transport./c ?&gt; ... &amp; Copy of letter dated the 19th June 1939 from Mr. B.H.

Company's wishes regarding expedition in motor cars thoroughly discussed with Sultan of Muscat and Wali Mudhaffar and have now been informed by Sultan that at present stage it is too early to introduce motor transport into areas to be visited and that Sultan cannot guarantee safety of party in cars owing to danger of from unsettled bedouin. Sultan states and Wali confirms that a party using camels would have no difficulty visiting any place and besides the Wali he would instruct Sheikhs of A1 Bu Shamis and Na'im to accompany party also if necessary Banni Kaab. Sultan states that entrance from Baraimi even on camels will not be advisable as it is possible that the same situation as last season might anise. Sultan would himself accompany party on first stage of journey from Muscat in order to advertise fact that expedition is under his auspices. Sultan states that as far as humanly possible will guarant ee safety and freedom of movement of camel party starting from Muscat territory. Sultan states that Sheikhs mentioned and whose territory is undoubtedly Muscat have recently re-affirmed their loyalty and allegiance and are in receipt of regular salary. One year truce between Na'im and A1 Bu Shamis has been arranged by Sultan on Sheikh's recent visit to Muscat this is confirm ed by Political Agent Muscat.

The situation briefly ie that the area covered by the Sultan's proposals, whether actually administered by him or situated in the tribal areas of the Haim and A1 Bu Shamis, includes a large and important geological area which the Company wish to explore. The area into which the Muscat parly will not be able to explore is most of the Baraimi Oasis and a small part of Jabal Hafit, which areas are under the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The co-operation of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi (see iongrigg's letter of 20th June) is not required therefore for the area on which the Muscat party will work, and for the area under his direct administration the Company are entitled under their concession to his oo-operation.

With regard to (h). In this connection see paragraph li of my letter Ho.50-S, dated the 9th January 1939* I do not follow Longrigg’s argument that the party would get nothing more than one ride straight through the country con cerned on camel-back#. On this assumption even if they used cars the party would get only a car ride instead of a camel ride* Moreover if this is the Company's feeling, their action in authorising hermitte to approach the Sultan is inexplicable*With regard to (c).

Since the Company are hound under the terms of their Muscat concession to pursue their exploration with reasonable diligence, since their objects to the Sultan's proposals ao not seem to me valid, and since it is important from the strategical point of view that every effort should he made for the establishment of oil-fields on the Arabian side of the Sulf, I am definitely of opinion that the Company should accept the Sultan's proposals, further, if they ao not do so X am afraid that an unpleasant impression will he created that the Company have merely secured the concession in order to keep out others and have no intention at present of work- is confident that VuxSUxXXK, will make no objec- simultaneously in his own administered territory (vide item 2 in longrigg’s letter of 12th April).

I have been instructed by my company in London to inform you that the company is very doubtful regarding the value of a geological survey party coming out when faced with the following serious disadvantages a. Absence of motor transport. +■ b. Probable opposition of Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. c. Known weakness of Sultan of Muscat’s control in interior. d. Difficulty of adequate maintenance of party on camels. The company therefore wish to leave the matter un decided for the present. My London office have informed me that if they decide to proceed with the geological party on the lines indicated (camel transport) then they will communicate with you and with H.H. the Sultan and detailed conversations will be initiated. I have informed H.H. that for the moment my company have decided to leave the matter of a geological survey, owing to it not being possible to facilitate motor transport into the territory occupied by the A1 Bu Shamis and Naim, but that should the company decide at a later date to make other arrangements they will communicate with His Highness. I shall therefore leave Muscat tomorrow 23rd June and proceed to Kalbah where I shall make enquiries from Sheikh Khalid as to what progress he has made regarding arrangements with Mohamed bin Ali of the Banni Kitab.

The subject has been discussed again with Longrigg, who was informed of your views, though it was not felt possible to press the Company too far to carry out exploration in an area where they themselves felt the circumstances were unfavourable. After further consideration in the light of this discussion Longrigg has communicated the Company’s views in the let uer of which a copy is enclosed herewith. 3. It is clear from this letter that the Company feel that exploration in the Ibri-Dhank-Jebel Hafit area in the near future is likely to be unsuccessful and possibly also not without risk to their personnel, and in the circumstances I fe&amp;.i tncit their view must be accepted that plans for exploration in this area in the coming winter season should be abandoned. 4. As regards exploration in the territory under the control or influence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi Longrigg laid great stress on the difficulty caused by the Sheikh’s avarice and unreasonableness. He said, for example, that the Sheikh’s charges for guards (Rs. 4a day) were four times the rate usually paid. Please consider whether it would be possible/aaan 2 . possible ? following his suggestion, for the Political Agent to have a frank talk with the Sheikh and try to persuade him that it is in his own interests that he should give the Company every facility and assistance in working the Concession.

Lermitte states verbally and the Shaikh denies that any discussion was held in regard to geophysical exploration inside the area covered by the Concession.

(The latest reference to this person that I can trace is at paragraph 6 of Political P'Hi Agent, Bahrain's letter No. C/277 dated 27th April,1939). 3* There is, of course, no hurry about this, as I am at present too much occupied with the air route questions to get up the Batinah; but you would perhaps let me have your instructions in due course as to whether you would like me to follow up this possibility, and whether Petroleum Concessions Limited are prepared to put up a substantial present for Sheikh Mohammad bin Ali, in the event of my making the contact.

We had an interesting and extremely amusing discussion on local politics and supplies. Ihe four Shaikhs were in good spirits and the conversation which lasted for I the best part of an hour was most amicable* 3* To have induced Mohammed bin Ali bin Huwaidin to visit Sharjah after an absence of ten years is rather an achievement and due credit must be given to Khan Bahadur Abdur Kazzak for the skill with which he has handled a situation which had previously proved too much for the Shaikh of Sharjah even though that gentle men backed his invitation with the offer of gift of Bs*80,000* At the same time it must be remembered that it is unlikely that the Residency Agent would have been successful so quickly if we had not held the lives of all the inhabitants of Trucial Oman in our hands. We are the main source of supply of their vital neces sities •UA « 2 - Mow that the ice has been broken I am hopeful of much closer relations with a body of men who are afraid of no combi nations of ‘irucial Shaikhs and of whom the Shaikh of uubai speaks with respect and confesses to being most reluctant to antagonize. Trucial Oman to the west of the central range and their area spreads from JJhaid in the north to well below the southern limits of Jebel ?aiyah. In my opinion their closest contacts have always been with the Shaikhs of Sharjah and there is little doubt that at one time the Shaikhs of Sharjah exercised jurisdiction over the greater part of the area which the tribe today occupies. There is even less doubt though that the present shaikh of Sharjah would not have the slightest hope of exercising his authority in any part of the Beni Qitab tribal area unless it v/as with the consent of Shaikh Mohammed bin Ali bin nuweidin. ihe tribal area of the Beni Qitab is of particular interest in that it forms part of the area which Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited could with some justi fication maintain was within the limits of their agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah. 5. The fewer the Shaikhs that we have to deal with when oil company operations recommence after the war the better. Therefore i would like authority to instruct the residency Agent to discuss quite unofficially with the shaikh of Sharjah the possibility of his coming to an amicable agreement with Mohammed bin Ali bin Huweidin whereby the Beni Qitab would raise no objection to the entry into the territory under their immediate control of Petrole Concessions Limited for the purpose of exploring for and if neces sary extracting petroleum products, in return for a share of the Shaikh of Sharjah*s present and future revenues from Petroleum Concessions Limited. 4.

These locust hunters have also driven from Sharjah to the Has a province oi ^ waudi Arabia via Abu Dhabi and Sabkhat Matti. xxxx ihe r olitical people suggest that it is perhaps r tner rly to begin tying up the Beni Ohittib with i ormidabla documents such as concessions. They suggest that bneikn of Sharjah be given tjie chance to pake some imancial agreement with them,* so as to ^nclude their territory in the Sharjaii concession. -hen as it seems most unlikely that Sharjah will be pfirsuaaed to disburse enough money for this, we would then go direct to the Beni Ghittib and say that we want to run a survey over the whole Trucial ^cas i rorip the mountains to Abu Dhabi irrespective of wnose territory m pass through.

A^Aprtl, 1945 S S U With reference to Peplr’a letter to you No.Ext.587/45 of the 21st February regarding^LC.L’s plan for geological survey work in the Museat~Tracial Cpast area, I enclose herewith an extract from a letter dated 12th April fro?! Dongrigg (who has now returned to P.G.L, from military ser^rice) which explains the Company's present intentions. I also enclose a copy of a note written for the Company by Williamson.x x ^y ■ 2. From subsequent conversation with Longrigg, it appears that the Company are now definitely intending to send a small geological and mapping party next winter to approach the Jebel Fay ah Earaimi and Jebel Hafit areas from the north, to complete mapping of these areas and to make all such local and southward contacts as they can manage, with the cognisance of the political authorities. They also have the idea of setting up some sort of Headquarters at Baraimi with the object of acquiring goodwill locally through the distribution of gifts, and possibly the presence of a doctor. It seems unlikely that the Sultan of Muscat will derive much satisfaction from operations in this area, and I asked Longrigg | whether the Company had much interest in other parts of Muscat territory at the moment. Longrigg thought that it would be easy at any, time; to carry out geological work in the Batin&amp;h, arid that it would perhaps be less easy, but not at all impossible, to work from I the South opposite Masira northwards along the western foothills in | the 'Ja'alan and Beni Bu All country, Langrigtf subsequently dis- The Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K,C«I*E f The Residency, Bushife, cussed/ . . &gt; aKrrgli1k&gt; \ cussed, with his Company, the possibility of inspecting, this quadrii lateral of territory inland from Ras al Hadd / Masirah and reported to me that, while the Company’s geological expert, Mr«Baker, did no view the territory in question with any great enthusiasm, he would be willing to inspect it either from the air (to feee whether or not it was sand covered) or by a surface party, but not yet by a geo physical party. The Company say, however, that in 1938/9 they wished to reconnoitre this area from the air, but the Sultarfwas unable to authorise it. They feel that, before taking any forward steps in the matter with a view to air or surface exploration, they would need an assurance' from the Sultan of Muscat that access to it can now be guaranteed. Would vou please let us have your views as to Whether it would be worth pursuing this suggestion? If so, the necessary assurance might be obtained. 4-* Meanwhile, the Company's representatives will be proceedir in consultation with the local political authorities, to set in moti the programme outlined in the extract from Longrlgg f s letter of the /12th April, and intend to introduce a geophysical party in 194-6.

Trucial Coast this autumru Summarising, I consider that although the political situation has improved heyond recognition during this v/inter, the problem of supplies and skilled help are still extremely difficult, and I should be most hesitant' about sending a geophysical party this year, although a small geological party of say two men could probably manage. \ ' The Political Situation This v/inter the Beni Chit tab have ( at long last deigned to attend meetings with the political authorities and with the coastal sheikhs. Their sheikh Mohammed Ali al Hmvaidin has visited the Residency Agent in Sharjah, although it cannot yet be said that he' is on cordial terns with the Sheikh there. lie also attended a party near Dhaid, at which the Political Resident; the political^Agent, and all the coastal Sheikhs east from Bubal to Ras al Khairaa were present. I myself visited Dhaid with t’ne local political Officer to inspect the v/ater channel there, which was being repaired (vide GR. 77. Page 1.) , I was then invited to - . r,-, accompany him to a locality called Hamdha, some 12 miles south of Dhaid, 'and about 4 miles from Jabal Faiyah, where we met Mohammed Ali and hatd coffee and a snack with him.- I was introduced as the water expert who was working for the R.A.F., and who had come to inspect the work at Dhaid, no mention being made of course to my connection with an oil company. It was noteworthy that two Indian members of the anti—locust commission dressed in felt hats and gents* lounge'suits, were collecting two guarde, who, the old men assured them would sufiice as * . /protection2 , ■ protection anywhere north and east of Jabal Faiyah. To the West and South, he insisted, however that they should have six meru Although this indicates a very marked change of attitude from that adopted in 1938, it should not be hailed with excessive optimism, as a sign that Company men can move in at once. It should be remembered that the Shaikhs and their people are at present all dependent on the British Government for such staple articles of their diet as tea, sugar, coffee, flour, etc., and as the locust men are apparently harmless people whom it pleases the Government to send in hunting locusts, they also are tolerated. Nevertheless they are moving about in oars, with no attempt at dressing up as Arabs, and they are accustoming the’ inhabitants to these novelties* They have also cleared tracks in Certain parts. One example is the motor track which Glynn Jones and I followed from Sharjah to Dhaid, and thence south to the foot of Jabal Rodha, (vide map CR.77-1). This is now passable through the Oman mountains by way of the Y/adi al Qor to Kalb a. These locust hunters have also driven from Sharjah to the Hasa province of Saudi Arabia via Abu Dhabi and Sabkhat Matti... .. . The Political people suggest that it is perhaps rather early to begin tying up the Beni Chittab with formidable documents such as concessions. They suggest that the Sheikh of Sharjah be given tha chance to make some financial agreement with thou, so as to include their territory in the Sharjah concession.- Ttfen as it seems most uiilikely that Sharjah will be persuaded to disburse enough money for this, we could then go direct to the Beni Gliittab and say that v/e want to run a survey over the whole of the Trucial Coast from the mountains to Abu Dhabi irrespective of whose territory we pass through. We can then offer them a lump sum to allow us to include their land whatever may be its limits, in this survey. Later, when Mohammed All has handled, some of our money a concession agreement can be introduced as a means of letting him have some more. V/it bout an agreement he Svould undoubtedly try to extort more money out cf us in the 'first season, but as all the other sheikhs seem to do this even with them, it would not appear to be very different. I myself feel that this might be the best means of approach. It is virtually what I had to do with Shaikh Saqr at Biraimi - V U ' # /in) In 1933. Despite all the parents- made 'by Muscat to him, presumably to cover our survey, he wpuld not budge or Allow us to do any work until I paid up. : Vfiiile i fully realise triat t^ere is a desire in London to have the boundaries ~ clearly marked on a map, and the signed and witnessed agreements all filed, I venture to state that some elasticity must be allowed when dealing with the Sheildis' of the interior. They themselves are quite illiterate and are much less' ; c accustomed to western ways of dealing than-the Sheikhs on- the coast. They .are ^therefore most suspicious of any' document which they cannot understand, and are quite liable to give a categoric 'no*’ and retire to the mountains if ary^ ♦attempt is made to coerce them into signing any hard and •• fast agreement. (We once had a drilling superintendent in the Company who - had the same suspicion), One more point is certain. * As I: have always said, and the Pol it ical -people agree, the Beni Chittib are in no way subject to Muscat.--- 1 They are however friendly vi(ith Dubai and Ras al Khaima, but- _not on very good terms withvgharjah. c . it V Xn general, therefore, the Political authorities see no reason why we should not get as far. south. As. Biraimi.. The Albu Shamis and Na* im -would have to be approached through the Sultan of Muscat to let us as far south' as Dhank and lanqul. f The Imam at Ibri is still coy, aiid it. is suggested that an-approach-northwestwards from the Ras al Hadd — llasirah direction might be possible. Thus the unsurveyed area under the Imam* s control, (he being still at varlahce c. with Muscat) -would be comparatively small. : Looa.l public opinion might then -be influenced s uf f ic lent by by the sight of wealth accruing to neighbours, to overcome the scruples against allowing us through. This is a slight .modification of what I wrote on page 3 of my Note on outstanding Concessions on 12th October last year, but it -&amp;till eirphasises o the desirabilit^of making gradual advances to these remoter o- sheikhs.^- v '.;e: .y\ o- ^ -I v , t£&gt;' v • t . .

Sharjah also is /more•u mor® convenient to the Residency Agent and the wireless office in the B.O, A.C. Rest House, Transport . I have learned a considerable amount about transport on this last trip, and shall write a separate note on it. Labour . All information I liave gleaned supports Mr, Larmitts* notes. There is an acute shortage of artisans, drivers and servants both in Bahrain and on the Coast. R.A.R engineers inform me that this labour question is very seriously delaying their construction programmes in 'both areas. The result is that wages have risen and this has attracted Iraqis to such an extent that the shortage is now also being felt in Iraq, The larger employers of labour there have now asked the Government to prohibit this emigration. It will therefore be difficult, if not impossible to. obtain enough drivers, cooks and boys for our party, either locally or from Bahrain or Iraq. Although I am not quite certain I believe we should find that we should not be able to obtain men from India either, CONCLUSION. Taking all factors into consideration I should recommend that no geophysical party be sent to the Trucial Coast this autumn unless adequate supply of tinned and diy provisions both for the European and local staffs have been obtained and landed on the Coast, and unless sufficient drivers and other personnel have been recruited. Special arrangements would also have to be made for the supply of fresh food, from some' source other than Bahrein, where both the civil and services populations are short, (l saw one plane load of fruit and vegetables land while I was there.) On the other hand a great deal of valuable preliminary work might be done by say a geologist and a surveyor spending the winter on the Coast. * These men should preferably be men who would enjoy ha»vking and hunting with the Sheikhs, and who would have the patience to sit drinking coffee and becoming better acquainted with them. They could scout out passable tracks, locate water points, do some triangulation and add some more information at times on tribal boundaries, and place names. They mightI y 86/21 &amp; 86/12.

The first point I would like to make is that, I think, P.C.L. should be asked if they are able to state exactly what they want. I presume that the least they want is 'denial” concessions over the whole Trucial Coast area, i.e., even if they do not want to operate there, they wish to exclude other interests. The rest of my letter proceeds on this assumption, 3 . I am sure that the idea of trying to get the shaikh of Sharjah to make a working arrangement with the BarriT Qitab Chief never had a chance of success. I do not think much 1 either of the proposal for dealing with the Bani Qitab which is described in Williamson’s note, a copy of which ig^ericlosed with Harrison’s letter No. Ext.1758/45 of the 24thC&amp;pril, 1945. I have gone through the Concession agreements made with Has al Khaimah, Umm al Quwain, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, and Kalba (the Dubai agreement is missi^ng, which is typical of the recording in my office). All these agreements are made as applying to (e.g.) 'the State of Sharjah including all islands and territorial waters appertaining thereto”. There is a further clause that when the areas of the states ”are determined the area covered by the concession will be coterminous with the limits so deter mined”. I am merely exphasizing the fact, of which you are well aware, that even the areas of the Trucial States recognised by us are not defined. Now, if one is to go on making agreements with every Shaikh of some influence on the Trucial Coast whether he is recognised by us or not and making these agreements for unspecified territory, there will clearly be no end to the nego tiations involved and the money to be spent. I believe that this is the time to put a stop to the possibility of anything like this happening - as it might well do if the proposal for dealing with the Bani Qitab were followed and allowed to form a precedent. The only way to stop it is by facing up now to the question of determining the limits of the states. I would go to all those recognised by us and ask them to state clearly the areas which they claim to be under their ’’sovereignty”. It would be pointed out to them at the same time that they are expected effectively to control such areas and if they should not be able to do so it would be a ground for holding them to have broken their promise - in the case of P.C.L. to ’’give the Company all protection in (his) power”. This last is a quotation from the Sharjah Concessions Agreement with P.C.L. (Article 15). After we received the replies of the Shaikhs we should at least know what territory was (a) indisputably belonging to a particular shaikh, (b) claimed by two or more, (c) joint.

One practical diffi culty in starting to get the areas of the shaikhdoms defined would be that of obtaining maps; but doubtless this could be overcome. 4. in the particular case of Sharjah his position vis-a-vis the Bani Qitab Shaikh would be reviewed after we had determined what exactly is the area within his state and what area he can effectively control. 5. I have been talking over this case with Bird who was also political Officer, Trucial Coast, and as a result have a further paragraph to add to this letter. I would like to emphasize that my proposal to open the question of determining the limits of the states does not necessarily involve, as regards the area as a whole, taking the matter any further than as proposed in paragraph 3. Particularly, it does not involve appointing anyone to determine definitively the areas of the states after we have received the Shaikhs* replies. As usual the case is one of the flag following trade and we are being almost forced to take political action as a result of the activities of P.C.L. Having taken the case as far as I propose, I do not contemplate further action until such time as P.C.L. indicate that they have particular interest in a certain defined area. It would then, of course, be necessary to determine definitely to whom it belonged, though the same thing would probably have to be done for another area or areas in order to avoid giving the show away.86/21 Telegram S Agency.

Sultan, who asked for time to consider matter, states that he cannot guarantee access to Jaalan and-Bene Bu All territory for land party without consulting Shaikhs.

He sees no objection to aerial survey over this area subject to same caution over low-flying given in 1938. 3. My comments on India Office letter No. 1758 of 24th April are (a) Sultan would welcome operations in Batinah. (b) Company*s statement that Bultan was unable to authorize area reconnaissance over southern area appears incorrect (c.f. paragraph 2 of Muscat Express Letter No. c/6 of 10th January 1939). (c) Air facilities now available offer exceptional opportunities for aerial survey of southern regions and Company should be encouraged to make full use of them.

(h) Company wish to penetrate Baraimi area from North. Terrain offers easier approach from the North and /-and use of this route will avoid the raising of conflicting interests in this area. I have therefore not suggested any approach to Sultan of Muscat for assistance in penetrating this area. In view however of considerations in your telegram No. 945 26th May 1939 I consider it necessary that he should.be informed of approach from North. (i) On Batineh and in Southern regions of Muscat Company may make arrangements on suitable scale after discussion of details with Sultan. 1ft the penetration from the North I presume party will be on the small scale suggested in second paragraph of your letter under reference. - GALLOWAY - Office of the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Camp, Shiraz.

Also discussed is the possibility of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi (Shaikh Shakhbūt bin Sulṭān bin Zāyid Āl Nahyān) providing access to Baraimi [Al Buraymī ] now that a concession has been signed for his territory; and other work that might be undertaken in both Muscat and Abu Dhabi. This survey work was ultimately postponed owing to concerns over access to, and protection whilst in the relevant territory, as well as the outbreak of War in Europe.Later correspondence discusses the decision to postpone geological surveying owing to wartime conditions, and consideration of a resumption of work in 1945 with proposals for a small geological survey party working in the Baraimi and Jebel Hafit [Jabal Ḩafīt] area’s with geophysical surveys commencing in 1946. Included in the file are reports from a geologist for Petroleum Concessions Limited, Thomas Fulton Williamson, which discuss the potential problems of supplies, labour, transport, and accommodation that would have to be overcome.Other matters discussed in the volume include:news of the death of Shaikh Muhammad bin Sultan An-Nu’aimi [Sheikh Muḥammad bin Sulṭān Al-Nu`aimī] of Dhank who had been succeeded by his brother Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan [Sheikh Saqr bin Sulṭān Al-Nu`aimī] of Baraimi;the need to attempt to define the boundaries of the various Trucial Shaikh’s territories and proposing that initially each Shaikh be asked to state what they considered to be under their control so that areas of joint or disputed ownership could be identified;a meeting in Sharjah with the Political Agent at Bahrain, Shaikh Mohammed bin Saqr al-Jawassim [Sheikh Muḥammad bin Saqr Āl Qasimī] brother of the Shaikh of Sharjah, Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of the Naim at Dhank, Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad [Rāshid Bin Ḥumaid] of Al Bu Shamis at Baraimi) and Shaikh Mohammed bin Ali bin Huweidin of the Beni Qitab (also written as Beni Chittab). That this was the first time in ten years that the Chief of the Beni Qitab had been persuaded to come to Sharjah and was considered a positive sign that could benefit Petroleum Concessions Limited in gaining access to territory under the Beni Qitab’s control;concerns in 1939 over Petroleum Concessions Limited’s intentions with regard to their concessions in the Persian Gulf and whether they actually intended exploiting them or had merely acquired them to prevent other companies from doing so.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Bū Shāmis (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Beni Qitab (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Na'īm (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Baraimi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Jebel Hafit</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Jebel Faiyah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Geological surveying</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00029d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
