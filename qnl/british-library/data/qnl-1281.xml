I saw the Prime Minister this 'morning and spoke to him in the sense of this instruction. I also handed him aide mdinoire embodied in my tele gram 922, 2. The Prime Minister said he entirely agreed with the view expressed in this statement and in the name of the Persian Government accepted full responsibility for providing adequate protection to the Company's property and staff. He expressed the hope that every effort would be made to remedy existing defects (he mentioned housing at Aga Jari) as soon as possible. 3. I told him that both the Company and His Majesty’s Government were fully alive to the importance of pressing on with this work and that for our part we looked to him to make good a no less serious deficiency: present lack of any uA jOj regular machinery for consultation with labour. I reminded him that at the suggestion of his department arrangements had been made for Mr. Audsley to come to Tehran this week to advise them inTT £ 2- them in regard to drafting trade union regulations contemplated in the new labour laws* The Prime Minister said that he would certainly press the work of drafting and expressed a wish to see i/udsley as soon as he arrived. 4. For several weeks the Prime Minister has been suffering from an undiagnosed fever which has not so far responded to drastic penicillin treatment at the hands of medical officer in charge of Soviet hospital here. He is quite obviously in a low state of health and as there is no one in the government capable of deputising for him there is a tendency for current questions to hang fire. I touched on several of these and laid particular emphasis on the scurrilous anti-British tone of a large section of the press which was worse than ever in spite of my repeated representations (see my telegram 921). I warned the Prime Minister that if this state of things continued we should be compelled to take steps to ensure that the truth is made known. He agreed that we would be fully entitled to do so but would not promise to take any specific action himself.

The first which came out yesterday was a warning to the landlords of villages of the Tehran district to deal fairly with their tenants and to tenants to disregard the attempts being made by some political parties to persuade them to refuse payment of legal rents. The communique adds that a special committee has been set up to settle disputes between landlords and tenants and that its judg ments will be strongly upheld by the Government. 3. - The second communique published this morning after declaring that certain workers organisations have abused the goodwill and indulgence of the Prime Minister and exceeded their proper functidns to the detriment of the public welfare, states in emphatic terms that such activi ties will no longer be permitted. The Prime Minister warns those concerned that he will not permit such workers with the destinies of the people. 4. Both texts by bag. 5.

My immediately preceding telegram. . Following is a paraphrase of telegram of June 15th from the United States iimbassador Tehran to the State Department [Begins] In my view, joint United States - United Kingdom approach to Qavam is inadvisable. Le Rougetel appreciates fully the situation which makes separate representations more promising for both the United States and the United Kingdom. With current Persian suspicion of British aims, United States action would lose its effectiveness if joined with British representations. The suggestions are excellent that Qavam be encouraged to stand firm against the Soviets and Tudeh and that the Government be asked to seek help from the United Nations. The British imbassador and I are already lending such encouragement every day by all possible means. Concerning United Nations observers2 for elections, Le Rougetel has made such suggestion to Qavam and has received distinctly unfavourable reaction. Feeling in some quarters is that Qavam would actually welcome observers but that political reasons require him to oppose the idea* My own feeling is that Qavam 1 s lust for power is the controlling factor and that he would not desire any outside assistance. Only an unexpected threat to his present power [sic] position would cause him to risk a United Nations Commission. The vigilance of the election observers would give the Soviets a real propaganda weapon, with little promise of positive results on our part. The Embassy is already doing everything possible in line with the British suggestion concerning more propaganda for patriotic Persian reform and for progressive political parties. Effort is being made by the British Ambassador to work in close consultation with this Embassy. While over-all policies of United States and United Kingdom have similar objective of independent Persia, I do not think that joint representations constitute the best approach. Allen [Ends].

M Following is a paraphrase of a telegram of June 19th from State Department, to United States Ambassador at Tehran. [Begins] ‘H/ith reference to British memorandum of June 11th, Department offers its views as follows:- (1) Representations jointly by United States and United Kingdom are not considered advisable, because of the inference that Anglo-American bloc is operating against Soviet Union in Middle East. However in view of parallel interests in peace in the region, you should keep close contact with British Ambassador in connexion with individual representations by each of you to the Persian Government. You should continue to push upon Qavam that if his policy of apparent preference for one great power persists, in disregard of powers really interested in Persia's future welfare, the possibility arises of Persia’s losing its independence, either by becoming Soviet satellite or by being split into26 ~ 2 - into spheres of foreign control 0 Such policy v/ould confirm the view held in some quarters that it is pointless to try to keep independent a people who will not take firm stand on their own part. True, surrender of sovereignty to foreign domination may seem an easy solution for Persia to-day, but it offers no solution for the long-run. Also Persia would find it difficult, if at all possible, ever to retrieve its independence« (2) Department agree with suggestion that Persian Government be encouraged to look elsewhere in addition to Soviet Union, for assistance in social and economic problems. United States sympathy with regard to Persian needs can be expected only so long as Persia sincerely endeavours independently to direct its economic and political destinies. British suggestion that Qavam be approached concerning United Nations observers for forthcoming elections is not favoured by Department because of probability of Soviet resistance, general security council attitude, and adverse conditions in Persia at this time, (3) You should take every opportunity to emphasise to Qavam the advantages which would accrue.to Persia from a reform programme, to be effected by patriotic Persians and not by persons with devious designs on % behalf of a foreign power, (4) The Prime minister would do well to support formation of independent political parties in Persia as alternatives to Tudeh. Such action would be a step in/in the direction of a democratic political system' # [Ends] Foreign Office please pass Saving to His Majesty's /jnbassador Cairo, British Middle East Office and Bagdad as my telegrams Nost 24, 14 and 21 respectively.

There are signs that recent Tehran-Azerbaijan agreement is causing a split in the Democrat Party here. It is too early to judge whether differences will develop seriously but there are for example rumours today that an attempt was made yesterday to assassinate Jaafar Pishavari who has resigned as head of the Azerbaijan National Government and claims to be [grp. undec.? deputy] chairman of the Democratic Party. Twenty-nine people are said to have been arrested in connexion with the attempt. If there is any serious local opposition to Pishavari it will probably be headed by Ghulam Reza Ilhami Minister of Finance in the i National Government,* and Mohmed Biriya Minister of Education who have stood out in recent negotiations for iffor complete independence. The Left Extremists here are said to be dissatisfied with the agreement but I do not expect any serious organised opposition to it. 2 . The present administration of Azerbaijan is weak and muddle-headed and is likely to become more so under the agreement. Doctor Javid the new Governor-General is dishonest, boorish, and un intelligent, without any influence over the party or Fidais. Doctor Mehtash the Governor of Tabriz and Ali Shabistafi President of the Provincial Council are characterless nonentities. The real power will doubtless remain in the hands of presiding Committee of the provincial Council (the old National Assembly) over which Pishavari must still retain considerable influence but his resignation must affect the precarious unity of local administration, and in the last few days there have already been signs of greater confusion and lack of co-operation among the officials than formerly.

I started by giving him my impression of conditions in the south which are symptomatic of the present trend all over the country. The Governor-General of Khuzistan had told me days ago that without more specific instructions he could not maintain order in the province. Everything that.I had seen and heard during my visit bore this out. While out wardly calm the situation was in fact extremely unstable. The Government’s authority had been undermined and the Tudeh party were virtually in control. It was I said very far from my intention to intervene for or against any Persian party still less against forces of progress and reform. But it was clear to me that the Tudeh party is increasingly under foreign influence and whatever its intentions as regards reform might be its present activities are directed in the main to attacking all British connexions and interests in this country. If this process continued much longer ,unchecked I personally could see no outcome but a return to [CYPHER] CABINET PISTRIBDTIOH FRG.. TEHRJ.\ TO FOREIGN OFFICE Mr. Le Rougetel.

Your telegram No. 582 thethe situation of 1907* I then developed this theme on lines suggested. 3. There were I said two issues; the long and short term. .is regards the latter .jiglo-Iranian Co. , were giving proof of their moderation and their desire for a constructive solution by consulting representatives of labour irrespective of party about the nature of trade unions to be established under the new legislation. I asked that necessary supple mentary legislation should not be delayed and that in the meantime the Prime Minister should consider appointing a Government representative to particiLoate in these preliminary discussions. He agreed to give this suggestion immediate V consideration. 4 . ns regards the long tern problem he pointed out tnat repressive measures directed against the Tudeh party would probably defeat their purpose. He was however considering taking one or two of them into the Government. jit this point he referred with a sly smile to n somebody from Azerbaijan”, in the hope of sobering them with responsibility. He felt that persuasion might succeed where coercion would certainly fail. He asked me for my view on this point, I said that I was not concerned so much with the method by which the Prime Minister decided to check Tudeh excesses as with results achieved. I did not wish to urge on him repression or suppression or indeed any specific measures. But I pointed out that this was too serious a matter for experiment. Unless the Prime Minister were convinced that he could mould the new Ministers and make them see reason he might find that tney were moulding him. It would then be too late to apply any remedy. The camel which comes into the city for shelter has a way of upsetting it. The first requirementis therefore to determine whether the intruder is a camel before allowing.it in. I had seen the camel in various places and one camel looked to me very like another. Once again I urged the Prime Minister to take some action before it was too late to avert a situation which would be disastrous for his country. 5. In reply to his question I asked whether he did not think the only rational solution would be to invoke the support of the United Nations both for his programme of reform and for the general elections intimately connected with it. ^s I expected he said that it would be politically quite impracticable to invite U.ft.O. to supervise the elections. There would be a most violant and uncontrollable reaction from all parties of the Left and no constructive result would followo Moreover there would be no time to arrange it. ^t this point it transpired that the Prime Minister expects to settle the Azerbaijan question within a few days and from his earlier aside it seems likely that representatives of Azerbaijan will be included in the Central Government. as an alternative to invoking the assistance of U.N.O. the Prime Minister suggested that we and the Soviet Union should each state precisely what we consider our legitimate interests in Persia to be and that the Persian Government for theiir part should undertake to see these interests are respected but not extended. I asked the Prime Minister how he proposed to effect this clarification. Obviously matter of such importance could not be settled by an infoimal exchange of views. The Prime Minister agreed. He then said that he was asking me officially to put the question to you. I asked whether he would~4~ would put the same question to the Soviet jjnhassador and he said that he would. If therefore His Majesty's Government considers that the time is ripe for negotiation of a new Tripartite Treaty, the door seems to he wide open so far as the Persian Government is concerned* Foreign Office please pass immediate to Washington and hew York as my telegrams Nos. 210 and 91 respectively, also to Government of India as my telegram No. 304.

Qawam and Rishavari were in fact merely used by Soviet to '^sV\ prolong/- 2 - prolong discussions. Their motive in prolonging the agony was I suggest to bring pressure to bear on Qav/aiii with a view to securing admission of the Azeroaijani democrat Minister to Central Government and removal of this question from the agenda of the becurity Council at the earliest possible date. I fancy for urns purpose II. Qawam would be given to understand that the longer the question remained before the Security Council the greater the price he would have to pay when his Government v/as finally reconstituted* This would account for his anxiety on the one hand to avoid all overt encouragement of United Nations Organisation and on the other hand to retain contact with United Nations Organisation until the last possible moment.

' Immediate Soviet aims in Persia may well have been mainly of a precautionary nature, namely: (a) To secure for themselves an oil concession in the North against the day when their own supplies run short and they have the equipment to develop fields outside the Soviet Union; and (b) To control the strategic area of Azerbaijan as a shield to the vulnerable Caucasian oilfields, etc* 2. But Soviet policy in Persia is already developing on the more ambitious lines foreshadowed in Mr* Robert*s Top Secret telegrams Nos. 1092 and 1565 ( to Foreign Office only ) and there can now be little doubt that Soviet designs in Persia do not stop short at the above aims. Organisation of Tudeh Party on a national scale, use of Azerbaijan as a means of pressure on Tehran Government, intrigues with Kurds, stirring up,labour agitation on Anglo-Persian oil [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be Sir M. Peterson No* 1926 D* 5#22 51st May, 1946.

Disastrous effect on British interests which would result needs no emphasis. 5. I therefore welcome Mr. Le Rougetel's suggestion that we should in future concentrate our efforts on driving home principles of free democracy and exposing true nature of Tudeh Party. Propaganda of this kind could be carefully combined with positive recommendations for radical social and economic reforms which seem necessary if Persia is to retain her independence^ A constant theme of Soviet propaganda (and presumably of Tudeh propaganda also) is to paint us as grasping reactionaries, indifferent and even opposed to social welfare of Persian people and anxious to maintain that country’s backward economy. This applies both to oilfield strikes and to our alleged subsidies to reactioneary parties and general interference (see Mr. Allen’s telegram No. [gp. undec]). Nothing would suit Soviet book better than for us to become identified in the public mind with opposition to reform. This can best be forestalled if we publicly advocate necessary reforms and emphasise the fact that we did, and still do, support American mission’s recommendations. Y.e could also publicise the sfcope of your proposals here in December 1945 etc.3. 4 V At the same time, I think we should take every opportunity of reminding the Persians of the material benefits which we have conferred and may in future be expected to confer, on Persia, e.g # improvement in communications, working conditions of Anglo-Iranian employees, supplies of various kinds for Persia, etc. In this we should surely be able to compete on favourable terms with the Russians. 5. Further, as our aim is presumably to strengthen the independence of the Persian Government - which does not yet seem to be a nominated group of puppets like the Roumanian Government - we could at this stage encourage proper implementation of Qawara’s proposed reforms etc. and not appear to ignore the Persian Government when showing up the Tudeh Party. Line suggested by Mr. Le Rougetel, that Tudeh is essentially alien, fits in well with a policy of strengthening genuine Persian authorities. It should not be difficult to show how Tudeh works on similar lines and with similar slogans, etc. to Communist-inspired 'stooge' 1 parties all over the world and that it is far from being an indigenous national growth such as -.the V.AFD, with all its faults, was in Egypt.

Sir, STcb I have the I have the honour to refer to my telegram TTo. 454_of 4th Apri1,1946 relative to the formation of a Persian EconomTc Council under the Axct'.;, presidency of the Prime Minister. The following is a translation of the statement, as it appeared in the Press, made by Mr. Qavam-Es-Sultaneh in defining to the members of ouncil the nature and scope of their task:- It of the war. The majority of the masses is deprived es of first necessity, food and clothes, and housing. 3 TV &lt; 1lb living during the past few years has so greatly increased that it has given rise to a general moral decadence. Production Vj.a has greatly decreased in comparison with the pre-war period, and the reduction in national consumption has been most marked. The ^ad economic situation has left its deploratole mark on the social and political life of the country and has destroyed the equilibrium between imports and exports. It is for these reasons that you have been asked to form an Economic Council for the country and to carry out this difficult task. I accordingly think it useful to enumerate the tasks which will fall upon you, and to indicate the economic methods which must be adopted. The economic policy of the Government is based on the principle of ensuring the economic life of the country. In consequence two principle points must be borne in mind. (a). To raise the general standard of living both by increase of production and of consumption. (bV To ensure an equitable distribution of the goods produced. The Economic Council must take into account this general aim of the political economy of the Government and with this in view draw up projects for submission to the Government. I give the assurance to the Iranian nation that the Government will bend all its efforts to put into effect these projects and these economic methods. In fact it is only by improving and increasing economic activity, and in raising the general standard of living by a more equitable distribution of produce that one can build a new and last ing basis for the nation and guide our country into the ways of progress and prosperity. Fortified by the support of H.M. the Imperial Shahinshah the Government will fulfil this difficult task and encourage the social and economic process of evolution which the country demands. For the time being the Economic Council must study the more important problems and prepare the necessary plans. I should like to emphasise that those plans which do not require new legislation will be immediately put into effect. For the remainder, decisions taken by the Council of Ministers will assure their fulfilment for the time being, and on the first opportunity they will receive parliamentary sanction. 1). The Law governing the monopoly of foreign trade will remain, as before, the basis of the economic policy of the country. If necessity arises, other measures will be taken to reinforce the provisions of this law. gives rise to anxiety. The standard of living of the masses in Iran, already low before the war, has been still further reduced gives rise to anxiety, economic situation in Persia is today very grave and / 2 ) Ris Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, LONDON. S.W.l.2). The necessary steps must be taken to improve exports (methods of packing, increase of production and alignment of prices with international prices'^ Measures will if necessary be taken in case of need to grant export subsidies* in principle fee subject to quota, ana the limitation of imports will be directed, to prevent their in^rdsn 1 ? 11 witfl products produced into the country, but as surar ^ntton 13 ? f ° r t ^ S s ° arclt y of certain products such tr, cotton piecegoods etc. , immediate steps must be taken asu PP 1 y in abundance and to put an end in this matter to black market, rationing and to the corruption which has caused. Energetic measures must be taken of\mng* ately PUt int ° effect definitely to reduce the cost 4 !^i ® eci&lt;ie u Pon the method of industrialisation of the country and draw up a plan for the creation of industries according to their importance and their necessity. it is evident that • without the creation of industries the economic activity of the Iranian nation cannot be assured.

Those industries whose raw materials are obtained in the country must be of V +h» P f^+^ SUCh + way that . theiP o^Pat will meet the needs ?£„ th ? futire country.

In the first instance technical facilities must be granted to sink wells and to construct irrigation canals and in this connection electric pumps and artesian wells must be used. The use of agricultural machinery will be encouraged. Measures must be taken to construct dams and develop a wider system of irrigation. 10). Cheap transport constitutes the first step towards the economic reform of the country* This problem must be thoroughly studied and a plan drawn up to develop railways, commercial routes and transit operations. The problem of aerial transport ust also be studied and its realisation ensured. ® r ® im P° rt a n ' t fro® every point of view and the mining resources of the country must he submitted to national exploitation production must be found, and the best methods ming exploitation and the capital required must be determined. + nec ®ssary instructions have been given to the competent Ministries in order to put at the disposal of the Economic Council, all the information required. The Council can form bub-Committees to which technical exports from Ministries and other competent persons can be co-opted. The Economic Council will have a special office under the President of the Council. Moreover we should take advantage of the existence of the Economic and Social Council of U!T0 and, if required, this Committee should be asked to send us experts for consultation and to draw up plans. The Government will take all the necessary steps in this connection. The aim of the Economic Council is to draw up a five-year plan within the limits set out above. Personally I shall do all that is necessary to ensure that the requisite facilities are granted to the Council, and it is in taking into account the importance of the question that I have personally accepted the presidency of the Council, I give you my sincere good wishes for your successin this great national t Qsk# p* J'o 8een Pl, ime Minister's programme covers almost e er^ aspect of economic life.

Vide ^ however, that Qavam-Es-Sultaneh remains in office for a reasonably long time there is no doubt that a serious attempt will be made to implement at least some part of this programme. ^he trend ^ he n °rth, and in Azerbaijan in particular, and the activities of the Tudeh Party have convinced the more responsible element of the Persian ruling class that unless something is done to improve the lot of the common man, there will be a social upheaval. 3. As stated in my telegram under reference the proposal to shut out in order to Protect local industry is a retrograde step, which will in some measure defeat one of the principal objects of the Prime Minister s policy, namely, the reductionjn the cost of living. It is also unlikely that the ambitious scheme for Municipal public services wil! get very far if their financing is to be left to the Municipalities hemselves. Their normal state is one of chronic bankruptcy and their efforts to raise long term loans abroad are not likely to meet with much success. An attempt will undoubtedly be made to develop mining resources, and a draft law providing for the formation of an industrial and mining bank is already before the Council of Ministers. R rema i? 8 8een h ow far these intentions can be carried i o effect, particularly in the direction of social reform.

The specific measures for which the Council has been charged to draw up plans include the following: (a) Increase in exports with particular attention to packing: prices must conform to international levels and if necessary subsidies are to be granted. (b) Imports must in principle, be subject to quota primarily to avoid competition with national products. (c) The establishment of plan for developing national industries.

(e) A 5-year plan is to be drawn up whereby^muni- . cipalities can finance public services such as lighting, drainage, drinking water, telephone systems. (f) A minimum wage must be assigned to the peasants to cover their essential needs. (g) Crown lands are to be sold to small' holders. (h) Irrigation schemes are to be developed. (i) lining research and development is to be carried out under national control.I 2 2, In cases where legislation is required the Prime Minister states that the Com Ittee’s recommendations will he made effective by decree of the Council of ministers and Parliamentary sanction will be obtained later. The economic Council will in case of need consult the economic C omit tee of U.N.O.'which will be requested, where necessary, to assist in drawing up plans and in providing expert advice. The Council is to draw up a 5-ye : ;r plan for the realisation of the objectives mentioned. 3. The selection of members of the Council is on the v/hole good. The Secretary-General is Araini a former deputy Prime minister, who is competent and honest. One of the members is Abtehaj the Governor of the Bank. Taken at its face value there is much in-the programme to command support but to bolster up inefficient local industries and to protect them against imports is a thoroughly retrogade step. The real difficulty is to know how much of the programme particularly on the social side it is genuinely intended to carry out. :Cynically minded persons might well feel that this is merely a piece of political window dressing forced on the Persian Government by the pressure of outside events and primarily intended to steal the Tudeh thunder, i might however add that the £hah, to whom I presented .. arliamentary Delegation, claimed to have been pressing for many of these reforms on previous Governments and was evidently grateful that he had been successful in so doing on tne present Persian Prime minister.

It is important that he should not feel that in order to obtain facilities for this commission he must hurriedly agree to terms with the Azerbaijan rebels which he would otherwise regard as inacceptable. The Security Council Resolution of the 8th May takes into account the possibility that the Persian Government may not have been able to investigate the situation by the 20th May. Consequently, if by that date Persian government have not been able to reach a settlement satisfactory to themselves with the Azerbaijan rebels, as a result of which a central Government investigating commission would be able to travel freely in Azerbaijan, all they have to do is to inform the Security Council that they have not yet been able to ascertain the facts. 5.

If they had any sense of justice they must realise that all the present difficulties of the country were the result of their criminal activities.

Since April 15th there have been sixteen incidonts involving the Company’s interests but only positive activity by the police has been in respect of charges against foreigners.

Minister had given instructions to the local Military Commander that order must be maintained but it is by no means certain that the Minister’s instructions will be supported by the Persian Cabinet in case of trouble..4* I do not wish to exaggerate the importance of these local incidents but it is evident that the Tudeh are taking full advantage of the patent weakness and indecision of the civil and military authorities and now feel they can flout the Central Administration with impunity. 5.

Tudeh leaders at Abwaz telephoned the Prime Minister that workmen at Agha Jari were surrounded by troops and that they were cut off from food and water. This move was obviously designed to secure withdrawal- of troops. The Prime Minister after preliminary enquiry of the oil company's manager here telegraphed instructions to the Governor General Khuzistan that a. Order must be maintained b. Investigation of workers' grievances should be made and where justified redress should be given. 3. The Oil Company manager called on the Prime Minister this morning and gave him the full facts of the position - Worthcroft emphasised that maintenance of security was key to the whole situation and that failure 2 \ to provide adequate measure of protection would cause ^'^grave damage to the interests of the Government and Company alike.

Housing and general amenities, are still not fully developed and present inadequate conditions offer fruitful field for Tudeh propaganda. Company are endeavouring to improve conditions but time lag is in evitable even in normal times before yield of a new field can be established with sufficient certainty to justify erection of permaent housing. 2. Tudeh party has been holding daily meetings for some weeks past but it was only on May 6th that agitation threatened to come to a head. Tudeh party demands were (a) 100?o increase in wages (b) double pay for overtime (c) 1 month's holiday with pay each year (d) Triday holiday with pay 3. These demands were rejected by the Anglo-Iranian Oil- 2 - Oil Company whereupon Tudeh threatened to intern British personnel and take control of essential services of the oil field. The local representative at Agha Jari seeing that trouble v/as impending asked on May 6th that military forces should he sent to maintain order. An officer and 27 mon were at once despatched from the nearest military post and a further 90 to 100 men were sent from .liwaz on May 8th. 4. Strike began in the afternoon of May 10th and it extended even to domestic staff of British personnel but a few domestic servants and workers have since returned to duty. No doubt as result of the presence of military i reinforcements no disorder has occurred and all essential services are being maintained by British personnel but it is still too early to estimate what reduction in output will be involved. It is feared that similar trouble may soon develop elsewhere. 5. As in the case of the Abadan strike one of Company's principal difficulties is the reluctance of the local authorities to take any decisive action against Tudeh party agitators. Minister of Finance visited Abadan a few days ago at the time of the strike there and in reply to representations to the manager he said the company's policy must be one of appeasement.

'Vi iSj^'v- Pravda 6th May prints important two column article on Persian question. . 2. Article begins by recalling Persian (reveminent*s anti-Soviet policy throughout last twenty years and its attempt at beginning of Soviet-German war to turn Persia into jumping off ground for German aggression against Soviet Union, attempt which was stopped only by introduction of Soviet troops into Persia, 2. [sic] Article says that after war it was obvious that Soviet-Persian relations must be established on new basis 'Free from enmity and adventurism, dangerous mainly to Persia herself'* But this was not understood by Persian ruling circles headed right up to February 1946 by anti- Soviet Hakimi. Therefore 'It was not difficult to guess reasons for retention of Soviet troops in Persia'. 3. Article goes on to say that intrigues of reactionary Persian rulers evoked unrest among Persian people, democratic movement developed and becameparticularly widespread in Persian Azerbaijan. This prompted British and American circles to raise question of intervention in Persia*s internal affairs and at Moscow Conference you yourself made proposal which was supported by United States Representative to form /Tripartite2 - Tripartite Commission which was to have taken upon itself solution of series of questions affecting internal life of Persian state by means of 'Recommendations' to which Persian Government was expected to give force of law. 4. .article says that Soviet Government rejected this proposal as infringing sovereignty and national independence of Persia. But initiators of Tripartite Commission acted 'in accordance with their accustomed standards of domination of great powers over small nations in spirit of principles which find their sufficiently unambiguous expression in policy of these powers in Greece, Indonesia and countries of Arab East etc. where national independence and sovereignty of small countries are trampled on at every step. 5. Article then says that at this point 'a transformation as unexpected as it was miraculous took place' and 'those very powers who had only just proposed carrying out an open and crude breech of Persia r s state sovereignty suddenly turned into ardent supporters of that sovereignty' and raised Persian question of Security Council, ^fter their initial failure at London Session British politicians supported by United States Representative 'decided to take their revenge at next session'. These 'hypocritical defenders of Persian sovereignty' were not abashed by fact that Qavam as Sultan’s Government had shown willingness to adjust relations with U. S. S. R. or that on March 25th the beginning of the withdrawal of Soviet troops was announced. 'Those very powers which for many months after end of war maintain their troops and military bases in dozens of places all over globe flared up with incredible impatience at presence of Soviet troops in Northern Persia in direct proximity to Baku'. /6*6* Article then says that real purpose of raising •Persian question at Security Council was to prevent conclusion of Soviet-Persian agreement which was however concluded on April 4th* 7. Article goes on to criticise decision to keep Persian question on Security Council agenda after April 4th as being H incorrect and illegal” and contrary to the Charter and to maintain that since those who raised question on Council did not yield to Gromyko’s arguments were not disturbed by fact that Persian Government withdrew its request and paid no attention to Secretary General's memorandum, Gromyko could do nothing but refuse to take further part in discussion. 8. Article concludes that above facts show that there is serious danger that U.N. 0* ’’will be turned into instrument of policy of those great powers who are striving for domination throughout the world and regard all forces which hinder achievement of that aim with unconcealed hostility’ 1 *- ’’Policy of powers who set tone in Security Council conceals in itself greatest threat for genuine authority of U.N.0. which can become serious instrument of peace only if it is ’’built on principle of equal rights of States and not on principle of domination of some States ever others”* Powers with imperialist ambitions consider Soviet policy main obstacle in their way and ’’try to decide international questions by means of agreement between Anglo-Saxon countries behind back of other countries”. Supporters of such policy take responsibility for undermining authority of U.N.O, Solution of post-war problems ’’presupposes primarily the necessity for collaboration of United Nations on basis of /observance. 7 ~ -4— observance of principle of equal rights and rejection of attempts to impose will of some countries upon others’ 1 .

Most papers urged him to come to terms with Qavam to preserve unity of the country at the same time hoping the latter would extend reforms to the rest of Persia. Tudeh placed the initiative in Pishevari^ hands suggesting that he would oblige the Government to do this; Farman even called him saviour of Persia. Mihem and Khavar of few remaining right wing papers criticise his arrival with an armed escort. The presence of Kurdish delegate in the party gave rise to some demand for similar rights for Kurdistan. Left Wing began campaign against Schwartz Kopf American adviser to the Gendarmerie. Articles by Messrs. Head and Foot were the subject of attacks and criticism in Left papers. , Campaign for restoration of Bahrein increased in violence and had the support of papers of the new Azadi party generally, supposed to be Qavam’s own party.

Adequate precautions were taken by the military and police to prevent clashes and no untoward incidents were reported. The anti-Jewish trouble seems to have blown over as no further assaults on Jews have been reported. 2.

If force were used a situation would arise in N, Persia which would be detrimental to the country’s interests, 4, In the circumstances the Prime Minister saw only three possible courses: (a) to attempt a solution by force; (b) to conclude an agreement now on such terms as he could obtain; or (c) to allow the delegation to return to Tabriz without an agreement. He said the Shah was in favour of (a) and had proposed to despatch one brigade to each of the following, Tabriz, Rezaieh and Ardabil. For his part he could not agree to such a course. The brigades were not strong enough in military sense to be sure of success and they might moreover succumb to intensive political propaganda. In either event the result would be a disaster. He asked whether I had any suggestion to make. I said that your instructions to me had already made it clear that you considered that it would be inopportune to seek a solution by force* (I did not (repeat not) explain that I had already said as much to the Shah when he adumbrated the same plan to me four days ago). For the rest, as M. Pishavari had refused tacitly an attitude which, according to the Prime Minister’s showing he considered highly isolated and detrimental to the national interest, the only course open appeared to be to allov/ him to return to Tabriz without an agreement in the hope that he might be induced to see reason later on. 5. /5 5« I understand that the Prime Minister will be considering the question again tomorrow in the Cabinet with a view to reaching a decision# Before leaving I asked whether in the event of discussions being interrupted he plans to issue any kind of statement# He replied that this also would be a matter for the Cabinet to decide# In conclusion he made point of telling me that in spite of M# Pishavari 1 s obdurate attitude, the conversations had been discussed with all proper form of courtesy* The general impression I derived from our talk was that the attitude of Azerbaijani delegation has not (repeat not) weakened as the Prime Minister anticipated and that as a result he is feeling nonplussed# Foreign Office please pass immediate to Washington New York and Paris Conference as my telegrams Nos# 163, 53 and Saving 10 respectively.

This strike was organised in sympathy with a strike which had taken place six days before in the Company's locomotive shops in which 50 men were involved. The reason for the earlier strike was due to purely personal reasons and was inspired by dislike of British foreman. 2* Demands presented later on May 5th by Tudeh representatives on behalf of employees were: (a) Reinstatement of locomotive shop strikers (b) Full pay for days of strike (c) Removal of British foreman in locomotive shop (d) Formation of an arbitration committee to investigate labour conditions and complaints; this committee to consist of two members of the management and two members of self-styled worker’s union.la3* Management of Miglo-Iranian Oil Company at Abadan have agreed to points (a) and (b) but have refused to comply with point (c). The strike leaders have accepted this refusal* As regards (d) the company have promised to give the matter consideration and they are In fact prepared to set up the proposed arbitration committee. They would in any case be obliged to accept such a committee once the new draft law on labour is passed by the Council of Ministers. I* The strike was called off and the men resumed work at 2 p.m. on May 6th. 3* There was no disorder at any stage but in anticipation of trouble Persian police and governor's body-guard of 50/60 men were standing by and a company of troops was also moved to Abadan from Persian garrison at Khoramshah. It was obvious however that the Persian authorities had no enthusiasm for their task and they urged the company to comply with the strikers* requests.

O.G. is still here and according to Soviet Consul will leave 6th May. 2. I have an unconfirmed report that there are still 20 or 30 tanks in barracks. Motor transport has greatly diminished, numbers of lorries being evacuated by railway. Most of the car parks and several buildings have been handed over to Azerbaijan army. No Russian military aircraft have been seen on airfield for ten days. Military telephone lines are being removed. 3. [Gp. undec.] sources say that Rezaieh Khoi and Ardebil were clear of Russian troops before 1st May but I have not personally- 2 - personally confirmed this* I believe that the bulk of the troops have also left Marasha and Mianduab but suspect that some tanks are left there. Soviet railway personnel are still in charge of Tabriz goods-yards and Soviet troops still guard the line. 4. Different moderately reliable reports agree that at the end of April Russians took back from the Azerbaijan array about 70 guns and several armoured cars. a11 but four remaining are said to have been withdrawn. It is probable that some are left with Azerbaijan irregular forces but it now seems that the Russians are using Vo percentage of Muobjirs (refugees from the Caucasus either stateless or Persian citizens). Many are now employed in the local G-overnment and most of the Azerbaijan army officers are believed to be Muobjirs. 5.

The surrounding country is entirely in the hands of the Kurds however and he does not consider it can hold out indefinitely.

He would then send reinforcements and supplies to Saqqiz and there form column to advance on Baneh and Sardasht although this operation through mountainous and wooded country, held by Kurdish tribesmen armed wich light and heavy machine guns, hand grenades and rifles all supplied by the Russians, would be fraught with danger.

You should at the same time tell the Persian Prime Minister orally that ,1 am very surprised that from the Persian point of view he should have thought it desirable to interfere with,the transmission of messages to the British press. He must realise that it is largely thanks to the publicity given to Persian affairs in the British and ..merican press that Persia has received the support of world opinion in her efforts to maintain her independence.

Repeated to Moscow No. 17 Saving. kk kk My telegram No. 66 Saving (of 2nd April: Turkish Press).c ~~~ ~~'~ The Turkish Press has maintained its caution as regards Security Council's consideration of the Russo-Persian problem. General feeling was perhaps best summed up in 'Son Posta' of 5th April, which considered that Russia had sown three seeds in Persia:- (a) The autonomy of Azerbaijan. (b) The Kurdish Republican movements (c) The Communist current. The article concluded, 'ife shall witness the spreading of these seeds'. Esmer, writing in 'Ulus' on the same day, had his doubts whether Russia would keep any future engagements in Persia any more than she had kept her promise to withdraw her troops by March 2nd. 2. The announcement of the agreement between Russia and Persia was generally welcomed but there was still the doubt v/hether Russia would keep her word. Atay in 'Ulus' welcomed the agreement on grounds that, 'provided it was loyally applied,' it was the best solution. He was impressed with the fact that the Council had, by its firmness, been able to secure such a solution and had caused 'those who, in Persia, wished to do deeds of violence with the aid of foreign powers to lose their courage,' He returned, however, to the idea that everything depends on the way the agreement is applied and he noted with pleasure that the matter will stay on the agenda of the Security Council. 3. General opinion is that Council has emerged with considerable success from a severe test. Nadir Nadi, writing in the 'Cumhuriyet' on the 7th April saw 'a radiant star of peace appearing on the horizon and promising humanity luminous tomorrows,' Other writers have been less optimistic but Esmer writing in 'Tanin' considers that th behaviour of the Russians in the Security Council has done them no good and that the light of truth and world public opinion have condemned Russia's actions and forced her to reach a settlement* 4.4. Foregoing mixture of reserve and satisfaction is reflected in Turkish official cirles who have no confidence in present Persian Government. Latter, they feel, may have given more away than now appears and though Turks believe Soviet troops will now evacuate Persia they ask themselves what kind of civilians will be left behind and what infil tration will occur later in guise of oilfields personnel and stores. Turks are however deriving some comfort from reports reaching them that Kurdish Republican move ment has got off to a bad start.r» -n Wlt'u tho Compliment* of the Undor v-,notary of Statfi tor Foreign Afrairs [CYPHER] L: .

On March 2nd ?! Kurdish Republican^’ forces encouraged by non-departure of Soviet troops attacked Saqqiz, Baneh and Sardasht which they claim as integral part of Kurdish Republic, 2. These three centres are all under Persian military government, Brigadier Homayuni, Officer Commanding Persian troops in Kurdistan, considers Saqqiz is in no great danger but entire country-side around Baneh and Sardasht is held by Republican forces and Persian garrisons in them cannot hold out indefinitely without succour. Danger is greatest at Sardasht which is closely besieged though Persia^ troops despite repeated attacks still hold vital bridge over Upper Zab river and have made several sorties in force with artillery and aerial support in course of which Kurds have lost over 60 killed. Persian losses so far are 4 killed and 25 woupded. Kurds are armed with light field guns, heavy and light machine guns, rifles, tommy guns and hand grenades all supplied/- 2 - supplied by Russians and have Russian or Caucasian advisers, most prominent of whom is Reruaz Aiiofi in Mahabad 3 5, G-hazi Muhammad of Mahabad wished to involve the Shakkak and Herki Kurds in attack on Sardasht and their leaders were brought in to Mahabad but demanded Shahin Dazh and Mianduab as price of their co-operation. G-hazi Muhammad would not agree to this and Shakkak and Herki Kurds therefore did not join in attack. 4 Mull a Mustafa Barzani with his brother .'lull a Ahmad and about 200 - 500 of his followers from the 600 or so households who had been scattered in villages around Naqadeh and Sulduz joined under a 'Democrat' Colonel named Dilshad Rasuli in attack on Sardasht which has been promised to them as their share of the booty. Many of Mulla Mustafa*s followers have, however, returned in small groups to Iraq* 5. Muhammad Rashid who after his escape from Iraq was living in Turkoman Kandi near Bukan with about 140 of his followers and was at first regarded with suspicion both by Russians and by Ghazi Muhammad has now been accepted as collaborator by these and about a month ago came to Sara between Saqqiz and Bukan with about 120 followers (some 20-50 of them having made their way back to Iraq) to join in attack but have so far refrained from committing themselves irretrievably. Though promised aims and money by the Russians they, have not yet actually received these, Muhammad Rashid in the/the meantime made overtures to the Persian military authorities, asking that Baneh he restored to him, but was told that he could not be trusted unless he first demonstrated his loyalty by coming to fight with the Persian army against the Republicans, He is still hesitating. 6. Road from Senandaj to Saqqiz has been closed all winter but snow clearing is now in progress and Brigadier Homayuni hoped it would be open for military trucks on April 4th, Re would then send reinforcements, . including those recently received from Tehran now posted in Divan Darreth, to Saqqiz and form column to advance to relief of Baneh and Sardasht though this would be hazardous operation through very mountainous and well wooded country strongly held by well armed tribesmen (c.f. paragraph 2 above), 7. If Sacjqiz, Baneh and Sardasht are lost by Persians as i s quite possible owing to geographical difficulties (they constitute long narrow salient of very mountainous country with Iraqi border on one side and hostile Kurdish tribesmen on the other side), very grave danger would ensue as Russians would undoubtedly be able to stir up trouble for Iraq and Turkey 0 Brigadier Homayuni therefore considered that Iraqi government (who had hitherto been quite supine and apparently sublimely unconscious of danger on ohoir loorstep) would do well to post strong garrisons at Qal’eh Dizeh near Sardasht and Shilar near Baneh to keep watch on the Kurds on their/their side of the frontier and maintain closest possible liaison with Persian military authorities on the other side. He also considered it would be very wise move for Iraqi government to grant Muhammad Rashid permission to return and reside unmolested in Daru Khan and if possible also offer to rescind death sentence on Mulla Mustafa Barzani and arrange terms for his immediate return to Iraq with his followers.C'.BINET DISTRIBUTION Mr. ^arquh 0 ^ No. 555 20th April 1946 FROM TEHRAN TO FORNION OFFICE T). 7.17 a.n.

A/V ^ ‘ ' Addressed to Tehran repeated to Foreign [gp^ omitted ? jlffica] and Zahidan. There was an anti-Jewish riot in Meshed on April 16th on the occasion of a Jewish religious festival. It is said that the trouble was started by a dispute between Persian and Jewish boys; a Persian boy was beaten and a runour was immediately spread that the Jews had kidnapped a Persian boy to be used as a sacrifice. An angry Persian mob consisting mostly of young hooligans immediately collected in the Jewish quarter and bricks were thrown at the houses, smashing windows and destroying other property. Serious developments were averted by timely arrival of the police and gendarmerie supported by military detachment. The Governor-General visited disturbed area which had a good effect. Later, however, there were some isolated cases of assaults on Jews. Jews are now remaining in their houses and Persian police are on guard in the Jewish quarter. Further . trouble is not anticipated. Soviet Consul-General took a very serious view of the trouble and immediately called on the Governor-General. He is of the opinion that Jews were attacked because they have shown friendliness to Russians and riots were therefore an expression of anti-Russian feeling. News...News of the arrest of General Arfa following that of Mohammed Zia and his brother has had a bad effect, and there is now a feeling that any prominent Persian who has shown friendliness to the British will be liable to be arrested at any time. Some doubt is expressed that the coming elections will not be free and all Persians know that it would be very easy for the Prime Minister to manipulate the elections so as to get in as many Russian deputies as he requires..- .[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained by the authorised recipient and not passed onj [CYPHER] C ABIHET DISTRIBUTION FROM TEHRAN TO F OREIGN OFFICE NO. 551 I MOSCOW Mr. Farquhar D. 6.29 a.m. GMT 20th April, 1946 19th April, 1946 R. 8.28 a.m. BST 20th April, 1946 F F F F F Following received from Meshed.

Brigadier Homayuni was at Saqqiz but I could not go there to see him as the road, though cleared of snow, is impassable in muddy section beyond Divan Darreh owing to heavy rain, and over 40 Persian army trucks were hopelessly bogged there. 3. I had long conversations with General Jehanbani who was in Sanandaj. He stated that the siege of Sardasht had not actually been raised but the Kurds had ceased all attacks on Persian garrison though they still hold the surrounding countryside in considerable strength. Tehran had actually ordered the evacuation of Sardasht but he had advised against it owing to the hazardous nature of the operation and instead proposed to send Brigadier Homayuni with a column comprising of most of the Sanandaj brigade to make a demonstration in force towards Baneh and Sardasht. Homayuni would, if possible, negotiate [grp.undec. ] and he believed good results could be obtained.

General Jehanbani was most insistent that the Iraqi Government should co-operate by (a) forcing Hama Rashid to return to Iraq under the threat that his properties there would be confiscated if he refused, (b) that Iraqi army posts should be established in Qaleh Dizeh and Shilar, vide my telegram No,46 to Tehran. If they did not do this Sardasht would probably have to be given up and possibly Sanandaj and Baneh also with grave and far reaching consequences for the Iraqi Kurds, amongst which the immediate return of Mullah Mustafa Barzani with more or less open Russian bands would be only the first* I told Jehanbani that I v/ould inform Tehran and Bagdad of his views. 6.

Repeated to ’Vashington n nrw.T New York (for Sir A, Cadogan) JJJ Persian Prime Minister came to lunch to-day to meet Parliamentary Delegation. News of arrest last night of General Arfa (late Chief of the General staff) following on arrest of Seyyid Zia and later of his ■brother together with rumours which had reached me of further impending arrests of nersona non grata to the Russians prompted me to tell the Prime Minister that whilst I disclaimed any intention to interfere in internal affairs I could not help feeling that all these arrests were hardly in keeping with his previous assurances (see paragraph 5 my telegram No. 397) that Seyyid Zia’s arrest was not the forerunner of a policy of persecution of any party or individuals whose only crime was that of advocating resistance to Russian domination. I was without instructions, and was only speaking personally .Abut I felt that my Government to whom it was my duty to f ^report these arrests would he sorry and perhaps concerned ° to learn that a regime of political persecution which ^ smacked somewhat of totalitarianism was beginning in the country/....country whose case they had so whole-heartedly championed before the Security Council. Persian Prime Minister was obviously uneasy and taken aback and murmured something about General Arfa's dossier disclosing rt a plot to endanger the safety of the realm by supplying arms and ammunition to subversive elements in Gilns’*. In other words General Arfa‘s crime is that of opposing Tudeh domination and persecution in that province. 2. These arrests are being generally interpreted as being the first fruits of Soviet Persian friendship and mutual understanding and as evidence of our apparent helplessness to protect our friends and all those elements in the country who were in favour of a policy of friendship and good relations with Great Britain. If these arrests and detentions without trial continue there is little doubt that our prestige will suffer and I trust therefore that I did not go too far in my language to Persian Prime Minister. 3. I then told His Excellency that according to a Persian newspaper he had this morning been reported as having informed U,P. correspondent that he saw no reason why his country’s case should now be maintained on the agenda of Security Council. U.P. correspondent had already denied to me that he had ever sent such a message. Could His Excellency also confiiti that Persian newspaper had misrepresented the facts? He said he was happy to be able to do so. 4* Finally Military Attache who was present through out this conversation and who acted as interpreter enquired of His Excellency what were his reactions to the somewhat ominous/.... *.- 3 - ominous reports which we had lately received of Russian troop concentrations in Azerbaijan particularly south of Lake Urmiyeh where we had reliable reports of presence of a Russian armoured corps of between 200 to 300 tanks, fas there not something sinister in continued maintenance of a powerful armoured striking force in this area, and how could it tally with Russian promises of evacuation when in fact some of these units had arrived after March 24th? His Excellency feigned ignorance and said that he thought that Persia was almost clear of Russian troops.

For your own secret information, I sent the following instruction to Sir A. Cadogan on March 21st regarding the situation created by Soviet Government's request for postponement of the meeting of the Security Council. 2. Mr. Gromyko's letter of the 19th March to the Secretary-General shows that the Soviet Government's game is to delay hearing of the Persian dispute until they can fix matters in Persia the way they want. In my view the Security Council should meet as planned and decide its agenda and timetable by procedural vote. Sir A. Cadogan should support the proposal, in his United States colleague s letter of March 20th to Secretary-General, to put the Persian complaint at the top of the Council's u/’-’da, and he should press for it to be discussed immediately. 3. Sir A. CadoganOUTWARD TELEGRAM - 2 - 3. Sir A. Cadogan should then ask ?/hy there had been no reply to the Note which His Majesty s G-overnment had addressed to the Soviet Government and point out that His Majesty's Government had fulfilled their obligation under the 1942 treaty and that they considered themselves entitled to ask what Soviet troops were still doing in Persia. 4. I told Sir A. Cadogan that the vital question was now whether or not the Soviet Government should with draw their troops in accordance with their treaty obligation. There was no need for the Soviet Government to prepare a case on this simple issue and the Security Council -would be failing its duty if it agreed to an adjournment while Russian troops remained on Persian soil. As regards the question of negotiations between the Soviet and Persian Governments, our evidence showed that it was untrue that negotiations were still in progress and that this was borne out by the terms of the complaint filed by the Persian Government. 5. If the Soviet Government refused to attend proceedings on March 25th or walked out if the Persian question were put down for discussion before April 10th, my personal opinion was that the Council should go ahead as far as it could without a Russian representative. Such action by the Soviet Government would be a direct challenge to the authority of the United Nations, which it seemed to me must be faced squarely. The Persian issue was fundamental and affected the whole future of the United Nations.( 25*f) is km [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on. ] [CYPKdR] CABIEjT DISTRIBUTION FROii TEHRAN 'TO FOREIGN OFFICII lir.

Gadogan, paragraph 1. So far as I can judge, the Soviet Government are not yet in a mood to yield over Persia nor is it in their character to accept defeat with good grace. I feel therefore that we should he prepared for a hitter struggle in which the whole structure of U.N.O. may be rocked to its foundations, if indeed it is left standing. 2. Soviet tactics are in the first place directed at securing delay so that they can present the world with a fait accompli inside Persia (see my telegram No. 1011). Request for postponement of meeting of Security Council is a blatant move in this direction and even if it fails, Soviet Government will no doubt maintain through thick and thin that negotiations are being, or could and should be, continued through new Soviet Ambassador in Tehran and that these negotiations must not be prejudiced by /discussiondiscussion of question at the Council, iuolotov fore shadowed such an attitude last night (see my telegram No. 1,120.) 3. What use they will make of time gained in this way His Majesty's Embassy at Tehran are better qualified than I to guess. 'Isvestiya*' of March 21st stated however that a change of Government 1 'is overdue' and if Quwam remains obdurate (which arrest of Zia suggests may not prove to be the case) I think that we should reckon with installation of more amenable Government at Tehran with the help, if necessary, of the Red Army. 4. Nor do I think that Soviet Government would hesi tate to arrange “voluntary' secession of Persian Azerbaijan if they thought this suited their book. 5. Soviet public has so far been left in ignorance of British and American protests, Persian appeal to Security Council and Soviet Government^ request for postponement of meeting. I cannot forecast whether Soviet Govern ment will agree to-be represented at the Security Council if this meets on March 25th nor can I say what tactics their representative will adopt if he is allowed to attend: whether stonewalling or the raising of every irrelevant issue. There are plenty of precedents for both. But although I think the Soviet Government are slightly shaken by the prospect ahead, I can see no reason to suppose that they will turn back or even show any readiness to compromise on what they clearly consider3 vital matter. On the contrary I fear that if the Soviet Government send representative to the meeting he will press their case with extreme obstinacy and that utmost use will be made of threat that any action which they considered hostile to the Soviet Union would lead to the downfall of U.N.O. . 6. This is no idle threat. When in September 19U S\r A 9 Clark Kerr urged upon him that great powers should not insist upon right of veto, Mr. Molotov maintained most strongly that there must be unanimity among them even if one of them was party to a dispute. He said that 'the worst would happen' if this principle were broken and that if one of the great powers committed a breach and really meant business then nothing would be left of the peace organisation, no matter what provisions had been laid down (please see Moscow tele gram No. 2,441 of 1944, which is worth re-reading in its entirety in the present context). It is true that the Soviet Government receded formally from this position at Yalta and San Francisco, but I think that it has throughout represented and still represents their innermost conviction. They attach, I believe, real value to U.N.O. but only on the understanding that it will in no circumstances be used to interfere with their plans. (Please see my despatch No,. 189 paragraph 4 and my despatch No. 190 paragraph 10)* If this assumption were proved false they would draw (and may /indeed* — 4 “ indeed have already drawn) with iron logic what seem to them the necessary conclusions. Recent international developments have I hope shown them the disadvantages flouting world opinion too openly and in present circumstances. They might therefore refrain from an open break with U.N.O. and decide instead that it is dangerous and should bo reduced to impotence. But it is by no means to be excluded that they will think it incumbent upon themselves to walk out of U.N.O. al together. 7. Whatever decision is taken at the Council is unlikely to affect the substance of Soviet policy in Persia, though for propaganda reasons every effort v/ill in any case be made to present this policy to the world in as innocent a form as possible. Indeed as I see it question which will in fact be decided one way or another in New York is not so much the future of Persia but the future of U.N.O. Unless some unexpected development occurs ultimate choice would seem to lie between the disappearance of U.N.O. as an organisation embracing the whole world or its reduction to an empty shell. I realise of course that the efforts of all other dele gations v/ill be devoted to finding an escape from this dilemna and that the good wishes of the entire world will be with them. But it would be dangerous to shut our eyes to the difficulties of the task with v/hich they will be faced. /8.4 / - 5 - 8, If hew ever the above fears prove exaggerated and tne Soviet Governinent show so^e readiness to give way it would I submit be prudent to give them every opportunity to lose as little face as possible in the process.

Maku infantry regiment Khoi mixed brigade Shahpur cavalry regiment Rezaieh mixed brigade remainder on frontier., .acting Consul General Tabriz agrees no large change in these. 2. The above formations appear to consiitute firstly general threat to Turkey, secondly particular threat to /TurkishTurkish Kurdistan which as long as it remains quiet, with the Kurds under tight control by the Turks, prevents realisation that Russia promised the independence of the Kurds embracing the Kurds of Turkey Persia and Iraq. .• Thirdly they serve to keep Persian Kurds subservient to Russia and prevent rapprochement with Persian Govern ment of which there have been indications in areas to the South near Senneh where Persian garrisons exist and whore successful out-come of the recent military operations and submission of some of the chiefs have strengthened the Persian Government's position. South of Azerbaijan. Reting Consul General at Tabriz reported the departure from Tabriz of two small Russian columns in the direction of Miandoab and karagheh the former believed to be bound for Khaneh on Perso-Iraqi border. Russian formations already in the area comprising one infantry regiment with artillery and . [grp.undec. ? engineers]. The purpose of this force appears to be retention of control and influence in the area and to prevent any northward movement of Persian Rrmy garrisons in Senneh and Saqqiz areas.. It would not appear to be an immediate threat to Iraq as the weather for another month would not permit of Russian aided resumed operations by Barzanis against Iraq Government. Kbamseh Provinc e. Force of 800 lorried infantry 20 tanks 20 armoured cars arrived at Tabriz ex Russia by train first week of march and left for Mianeh by road /and3 Mo and thence to Zenjan hy rail. It is thought that the object of this force is to reinforce the democratic rebels who had the worst in the encounter with the Govern ment partisans near Zenjan. Kerej. Soviet garrison of one battallion believed to have beon reinforced by another. Arrival of 12 tanks and one or two batteries of artillery by rail from Zenjan direction during' the past week confirmed. These are probably auxiliaries to Zenjan force as Consul at Tabriz had reported further arrivals of tanks and lorries at Tabriz ex Russia by rail after departure of Zenjan force. Gilan Ita zander an Gurgan. No change reported Soviet garrisons [grp.undec, ? number] approximately 5,000 chiefly in Gurgen. Khorassan. Meshed nearly clear of Soviet troops but these have not yet proceeded further [grp.undec. ? down] the Russian frontier than Kuchan—Tehran Meshed road. Reported increase of small Soviet post at Garmsar railway junction from 25 men to 1 battallion. Semnan clear of Soviet troops. Shahrud garrison evacuating via Sultanabad Kuchan road but maintained strong posi at Shahrud road fork to prevent access to Gungan area. Forces at Kerej and Garmsar 25 and 50 miles respectively from the capital serve to prevent access to the Caspian region via Chalus and Firuzkuh roads but also keep the capital in state of n.rvous tension. Alarmists predict Russian staged disturbances in the capital by Tudeh /followed— h — followed by entry of Russian troops.

According to an estimate by His Majesty s Consul-General, Meshed, the Russian military garrison in that town numbers about 1,500. In Sabzevar and Kuchan there are small detachments of about fifty men. In Shahrud the numbers are larger and show a recent increase, but this is probably due to concentration at this railhead of troops recently evacuated from Semnan. A zerbaijan. 7. The Azerbaijan National Government passed two new laws on the 20th February. The first provided for the division among the peasants of all lands which had become State lands since the accession of Reza Shah. The second law dealt with the confiscation of all movable and immovable property of all persons who had left Azerbaijan and who were carrying on propaganda against or fighting against the Azerbaijan National Government. 8. The fact that calling-up notices for the Azerbaijan People’s Army were posted in Rezaieh indicates that the Azerbaijan National Government does not recognise Kurdish claims to this place. 9. The Minister of Finance in the Azerbaijan National Government has called upon the local manager of the A.I.O.C. to pay to his Government all excise duties hitherto paid to the Central Government. The manager has replied that, as these dues were previously paid over in Tehran, he is not in a position to comply with the order. The duties amount to rials 13'50 per 4-gallon tin of petrol and rials 9 90 per 4-gallon tin of kerosene. The National Government s desire to lay their hands on this considerable source of revenue has long been known 10. According to a consular report, a Russian cavalry regiment with horse- drawn A.T. guns, A.A. guns and transport was seen at Tabriz railway station presumably about to entrain for Julfa and Russia. Apart from this move and the move of some Red Army women soldiers, the number and size of Russian military garrisons in Azerbaijan remain at much the same figure as before. 11 On the 2nd March about 8,000 people attended a mass meeting of the Democrat party. This was followed by a military parade in which some 2,000 “regulars” and 3.000 “ volunteers of the People’s Army took part. The “ regulars” had new uniforms and equipment and were armed with rifles, three or four machine guns per company being also seen. The “ volunteers,” of whom about 100 were cavalry, in addition to their rifles, had two or three field guns. A women’s detachment also took part. A ppointments, Dismissals. 12—(a) Military.

Personalities —corrigendum. 13. Reference appendix to last Intelligence Summary : the date of birth of General Aghevli should read 1885.Persian Civil Aviation. 14. It is reliably reported that an agreement has been reached between the various Ministries concerned (principally War and Posts, Telegraphs and T e “ phones) for the establishment of an autonomous Department of ( ivil Aviation, ^responsible directly to the Council of Ministers. The Ministries concerne an i ^■ turn over to the new Department all their assets, including budgetary credits, covering their civil aviation activities, including signals, meteoiology and e operation of the State Air Line. The director of the new Depaitment W1 e Ahmad Shafiq, the Shah’s brother-in-law. He is a licensed pilot with consider- .able aviation experience in Egypt, and has already shown more appreciation o the needs' and deficiencies of Persian civil aviation than any of the many and often conflicting authorities who have hitherto mishandled it. ihe polic\ wi regard to air lines seems to be to encourage foreign air lines to come to ietiran, to reserve the Tehran-Bagdad route for the State Air Line and to allow private enterprise to operate internal services, possibly under a system of licensing certain •organisations to run over specified routes. There are two possible private concerns in^he field, the Iranian Airways, of which the moving spirit is C. H. hbtnaj, the late mayor, and a sort of co-operative enterprise of pilots which is believed to have the backing of the Shah and Shafiq himself, but which has not yet come into the open. It is fairly reliably reported that Iranian Airways, who have been enquiring for British Dominies, have also made an agreement with the Americans (probably T.W.A.) covering technical and financial management in •exchange for a 10 per cent, share participation. British Interests. 15 The evacuation of Persia by British troops was completed on the 1st March, the last man crossing the Perso-Iraqi frontier on the afternoon ol that day. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Chief of the General Staff have been informed. 16. Syrian Interests. Asad Haroun has been appointed Syrian Minister to Persia. Appendix.

I have received inquiries as to whether it is the intention of His Majesty’s Government to replace British troops in Persia. No decision to that effect has been taken by His Majesty's Government, nor have they taken any steps to open negotiations with the Persian Government for the return of British troops. I ought to say that we received the most categorical assurances from General issimo Stefra- and the Soviet Government that the integrity of Persia would be respected, and that there was no intention of taking aggressive action against her. The Soviet Foreign Ministry, in their reply to the representations which we made to them in November last on the subject of reported Soviet interference in the internal affairs of Persia, stated: In so far as reference is made in your letter to the Tripartite Treaty of 1942 and the Declaration oi the Three Powers on Iran, I have to state that in accordance with this treaty and declaration, the Soviet Government invariably carries out a policy of respect for the territorial integrity, suzerainty and inde pendence oi Iran.' Moreover, at the time of the London meeting of the Council of Foreign Minis ters, when the question of the withdrawal of British and Soviet troops from Persia was discussed, I clearly understood from Mr. Molotov that there was no difference of view as to the date by which Allied troops should be withdrawn under the Treaty, that is to say, by 2nd March, 1946, six months after the signing of the Japanese instrument of surrender. In his letter which concluded the correspondence on this subject, which I communicated to the House, Mr. Molotov asked me to bear in mind the exceptional importance which the Soviet Government attached to the strict fulfilment of their obligations. It is difficult for His Majesty’s Govern ment to understand the present policy of Soviet Russia in this matter, and more difficult for us to believe that all these assurances are not going to be fulfilled. We are now awaiting the reply of the Soviet Government to the inquiries which we have addressed to them. When His Majesty’s Government be came a party to the resolution of the Security Council on 30th January, that direct negotiations should be undertaken between the Soviet and Persian Govern ments, they did so on the clear assump tion that the existing Treaty obligations to withdraw Allied troops from Persia 011 2nd March would be fulfilled, and His Majesty’s Government would regret any settlement which appeared to be extracted from the Persian Government under duress while the Soviet Army was still in occupation of part of Persia. • ^•o \^V fir ex' - j) trm I kx^vU W O-C fa p ^ ' 6 MAj?

Repeated to Tehran Washington. rrrrrr MOST IMMEDIAT E M? Your telegram No 0 683^ I handed a copy of note this morning to Persian Prime Minister. He read it carefully and seemed relieved. 2, He then told me that he was returning empty-handed to Tehran tomorrow. No agreement had been reached here, even on commercial matters and there was no point in his staying any longer. If he had a further meeting it would only be to say goodbye. 3. He added in confidence that the Russians had given him no adequate reason for maintaining their troops in Persia and he had not and could not agree to this treaty violation. The Russians had produced uhe ridiculous argument that at the Paris peace conference after the last war the Persian Delegation had put forward a demand for Baku, Turkistan and I understood u Armenistan n . The late Prime Minister, Hakimi, had been a member of that delegation and the fact that he was Prime Minister so recently proved that these demands were still supported by Persian Official circles. The Prime Minister told me that he had taken the initiative over Azerbaijan and asked the Russians to help him -FlG^.X- 2 - him over the restoration of the authority of the Persian Government there. He had met with a blank wall and the counter-demand that the Persian Government must first recognise the autonomy of Azerbaijan. I understand from a source in Persian Embassy that the Russians refused even to reach any oommercial agreement unless this recognition were accorded, 5, In reply to my question the Prime Minister said that the Russians had raised the question of oil. He had replied that he was prevented by law from even discussing the matter. The Russians suggested that a new Majlis should be called and the law changed but the Prime Minister pointed out to them that unless they moved their troops no elections for the new Majlis could take place. 6. The Prime Minister seemed very despondent. When I asked him what he proposed to do next he replied that he would have to decide when he had reached Tehran. He then asked whether he could count upon British and American help and what our advice would be. I told,him that I was not in a position to offer him advice from His Majesty’s Government and still less from the United States Government, But the note to the Soviet Government of which I had given him a copy showed clearly our attitude in regard to the Soviet failure to move their troops. In reply to further enquiries I also reminded him that the Security Council were still closely concerned with the question and when he commented that it would not meet again for some time I told- 3 - told him that it was on the contrary a standing body. 7. The Persian Prime Minister said he hoped to see the United States Chargd d’Affaires before he left. I mentioned this to the latter who is now better and who will try to see the Prime Minister this afternoon. Mr. Kennan told me that the United States Government who unlike us had no treaty rights, were disinclined to protest at this stage lest they might receive the reply that the Soviet troops were remaining with the consent of the Persian Government, He therefore proposed to ask the Prime Minister himself whether he had definitely asked the Russians to withdraw their troops. This should make it possible ■ • for his Government to make representations if they so desired. Foreign Office please pass most immediate to Tehran and Washington as my telegrams 67 and 128 respectively. [Repeated to Tehran No. 200 and to Washington No, 2065].

Secret. United States Chargd d’ Affaires was given a similar account of the position by the Persian Prime Minister, who then asked him what the United States Government’s attitude would be. He wondered whether they would protest categorically or couch their protest as an enquiry as we had done. This gave Mr. Kennan an opportunity to ask whether the Persian Government had formally protested against retention o£ Soviet troops in Persia. The Persian Prime Minister then showed him a copy of a note which was being delivered this evening to P.C.F.A. containing a strong protest. United States Chargd d’ Affaires afterwards met Persian Chargd d’ Affaires at P.C.F.A., where he had presumably gone to deliver protest. 2. Persian Prime Minister told United Stdtes Chargd d’Affaires that he had not been given any warning of Soviet statement (see my telegram No: 855) and had first t 111 1 , _ • ^ f • ^O^jBeen it in the Soviet Press. 7 MAR 1946 1 5. United5. United States Charge d'affaires, while making it olear that he could not prejudge his Government's attitude, read the Prime Minister a useful lecture on the importance which the United States Government attached to U.N.0« charter being fulfilled in the letter and the spirit and has sent him a copy of Mr. Byrnes speech to study in his aircraft tomorrow. 4, The Persian Prime Minister is seeing Stalin again tonight and said that so far Stalin had been 11 very hard. H Barring a la,st-minute change in Soviet tactics, it seems unlikely that the Prime Minister, who has hitherto shown more courage than might have been expected, will give way on the eve of departure. 5. I have just heard that the Persian Prime Minister is not leaving till 7th March.
