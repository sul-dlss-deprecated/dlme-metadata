I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th July last on the subject of the lighting and buoyage in the Persian Gulf, and to state that, in accordance with the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of that letter, he duly brought its contents to the notice of the Secretary of State for India. With reference to the penultimate paragraph, of your letter, the Marquess of Crewe suggests that the attention of the Lords Commissioners should be drawn to the telegram from the Government of India dated the 13th May, 1912. That telegram shows that the provision of dioptric lanterns at Bushire was necessitated by action taken by the Russian consul-general subsequently to the preparation of the general scheme for the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf and to the approval of the expenditure referred to above. The inclusion of the measure in the general scheme would therefore have been impossible. If practicable, the cost of the lanterns will be met from the sum of which their Lordships have consented to bear a moiety. Should this not be practicable, the Marquess of Crewe suggests that it would be reasonable, in view of the fact that the measure is an important, necessary, and inexpensive addition to the scheme previously sanctioned, that the cost should, like that of the rest of the scheme, be shared between the Imperial and Indian exchequers. If the statement in your letter that* their Lordships cannot entertain proposals for an increase of the expenditure already sanctioned is to be understood as merely an emphatic expression of the opinion that additional expenditure ought not to be incurred without clear and urgent necessity, Lord Crewe has no criticism to offer, since he is of the same opinion. But the statement, he points out, if literally interpreted, negatives the possibility at any time of an extension of the scheme that is now being carried out. Ibis would involve serious consequences, since the action taken by the Imperial and Indian Governments in regard to the buoyage and lighting of the Persian Gulf is necessarily influenced by the action of other Powers ; and, while there is at present no reason to doubt that the sanctioned scheme provides all that is necessary, his Lordship regards it as impossible to acquiesce in the view that it is to- be regarded as absolutely final. 1 am to add that Sir E. Grey is in complete agreement with the views of the Marquess of Crewe on this subject, which is one of serious importance in regard to the maintenance of British political predominance in the region in question. The India Office point out that the estimates approved by the Lords Commissioners amount to 84,000L (not 88,000b) initial and 7,090b recurring. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.

My telegram of 25th February last. ^ Lights at Bushire. Admiral reports that lights at Russian Consulate are visible over 12 miles, and that “ Alert,” thinking lights were on British Consulate, anchored on night of 16th April but found next day she was south of where she supposed. Hitherto no notice has been published regarding Russian lights and there is consequent danger to shipping. Admiral recommends that two lanterns, similar to Koweit lanterns, be sent immediately for Bushire Residency, one lantern showing red the other white light. Notice to mariners should be published on arrival of lights. I approve Admiral’s proposal, with which Cox concurs, and asks that dioptric lanterns be sent at once to Bushire by Store Department of India OfiS.ce, as for Koweit. Cost of each lantern, exclusive of freight, is Rs. 946. 8, with monthly recurring charge of Rs. 10 for watchman and Rs. 5 for oil. Treasury will presumably be asked to bear moiety of expenditure. I further think that immediate representation should be made to Russian Government to direct Russian Consul at Bushire to discontinue lights as Russians have now no concern in Gulf lighting., r—«. P. 3095. Sr x Sir, India Office, 27th. September 1912. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th August 1912, No. 32,465, on the subject of the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf, and in reply to say that the estimates approved by the Treasury amount to 84,000k initial (not 88,000k as stated by them) and 7,090k recurring, and to express regret that the marginal note to my letter of 28th May last was incorrect. With reference to the penultimate paragraph of the Treasury letter, I am to suggest that the attention of the Lords Commissioners should be drawn to the telegram from the Government of India dated 13th May 1912, of which a copy has no doubt been sent to them. That telegram shows that the provision of dioptric lanterns at Bushire was necessitated by action taken by the Russian Consul-General subsequently to the preparation of the general scheme for the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf and to the approval of the expenditure referred to above. The inclusion of the measure in the general scheme would therefore have been impossible. 3, If practicable, the cost of the lanterns will be met from the sum of which the Treasury have consented to bear a moiety. Should this not be practicable, I am to suggest that it would be reasonable, in view of the fact that the measure is an important, necessary, and inexpensive addition to the scheme previously sanctioned, that the cost should, like that of the rest of the scheme, be shared between the Imperial and Indian exchequers. The Secretary of State for loreign Affairs will doubtless lay this suggestion before the Treasury. /.With reference to the second paragraph of your letter, I am to observe that, if the statement m the Treasury letter that their Lordships cannot entertain proposals for an increase of the expenditure already sanctioned is to be undei stood as merely an emphatic expression of the opinion that additional expenditure ought not to be incurred without clear and urgent necessity, Lord.Crewe has no criticism to offer since he is of the same opinion. But the statement, if literally interpreted negatives the possibility at any time of an extension of the scheme that is now being carried out. This would involve serious consequences, since the action taken by the Imperial and Indian Governments m regard to the buoyage and lighting of the Persian Gulf is necessarily influenced by the action of other Powers ; and, while there is at present no reason to doubt that the sanctioned scheme provides all that is necessary, it is impossible to acquiesce in the view that it is to be regarded as absolutely final.

L4306 12 Sir: - I hciv 0 laid before the Lords Comnissloners of His jssty's Treasury Sir L. Mallet's letter of the 12th instant (26557/12) further respecting the proposed provision of two dioptric lanterns for His Majesty's Consulate General at Bushire. In reply I ara to request you to inform Secretary Sir E. Grey that My Lords apprehend that some misap- / prehension exists as to the effect of the sanction. ^ which They have given for expenditure or purposes of lighting and buoyage in the Persian Gulf. In the n r/jGv India Office letter of the 28th May, forwarded in Foreign Office letter of the 13th instant (22988/12), reference is made to a total capital expenditure of / y £102,400 with annual recurring charges of £7,700 and it appears to be assumed that the sanction of this Board has been given for these amounts. I am, however, to point out that these amounts were subsequently modified (l) by the estimate for the provision of a Depot ie Under Secretary of State,' r- Foreign Office.0 o f% f4 '**'• / ■* i0‘ Mi ., ^ /«# V. W-' f' f *■ Depot being reduced b ^£9^^J 2 ) b y the substitu- '4 ■ .•ti,. - ’ •• ' X , , V tion of a lighted buoy for a lightship at Bushire, v\'Lich resulted in a saving on capital expenditure of J LC &gt; : - nn an ^ on recurrent charges of £160 a year. A sun therefore of £15,400 nust he deducted from the original / estimate of capital expenditure and of £610 from re current charges. Accordingly the maximum expenditure in respect of which Their Lordships have agreed that a moiety should fail on the British Exchequer, stands at £88,000 for capital disbursements and £7,090 for annual charges cjid Their Lordships cannot entertain proposals for an increase on these sums. Indeed, as Sir E. Grey i s aware, Their agreement to bear a moiety of the reduced provision was only given on-the understanding that every endeavour would be made to spend less than these sums. In these circumstances They are unable to ac cept the view that, if economies are effected within the maximum provision of £88,000, these may be utilized for the purpose of carrying out schemes which have not received Their approval. As regards the particular proposal for the pro vision of dioptric lanterns at Bushire I am to say that although fly Lords fail to understand why specific re- ferencehen the proposal for lighting &amp;c., of the Persian G-tif'was originally submitted^ They will he prepared to accept a moiety of the cost } as specified in Foreign Office letter of the 13th ultimo, as a charge on the Exchequer, pro vided no addition is involved thereby on the maximum provision for capital and recurrent charges, which has been authorized by Them. Sir E. Grey will doubtless consider it desirable to advise the India Office of the terms of this letter, in order to prevent misconception in the future as to the limits within which expenditure is permissible.

India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received January 26.) (Secret.) ^ r &gt; . India Office, January 25, 1912. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of yonr letter, dated the 29th December last, requesting his observations on a letter from the Treasury, dated the 21st idem, regarding the expenditure on a scheme of lighting and buoyage in the Persian Gulf. 2. In reply, I am to remark that the course of the recent correspondence is not accurately represented in the Treasury letter, and, in particular, the Secretary of State for India does not understand the allusion to “the discrepant and varying statements as to the places where provision of buoyage, &amp;c., is of primary importance.” 3. In the letter of this Office, dated the 15th September last, it was recommended that sanction should be given to expenditure amounting, according to the most accurate data obtainable, to— Initial Annual, recurring- f 47,600 2,490 for the provision of— (1.) An acetylene gas buoy, and one light-vessel in the Shatt-el-Arab ; (2.) Light houses at Musandim, Tanb Island, and Shaikh Shuaib Island ; and (3.) A light-vessel for Bushire. It was also explained (in paragraph 4) that some additional buoys might be necessary, as to which enquiry was being made in a telegram addressed to the Government of India on the 13th September. 4. The second letter of this Office, dated the 18th November last, supplemented the first by recommending that the buoys in question (of which a list was given) should be actual!} 7 laid, at an estimated cost of— Initial .. Annual, recurring £ 2,800 210 For convenience of reference, prints of the two letters are herewith enclosed.^ 5. With regard to what is said in the Treasury letter as to the lighting of Bushire, I am to invite attention to paragraph 9 of the report of the committee, dated the 29th April, 1909, from which it wdll be seen that they recommended— (1.) A light-vessel at the outer anchorage ; (2.) A lighted buoy at the inner anchorage. The former was included in the statement enclosed in the letter of this Office, dated the 15th September, the latter in the list of buoys accompanying the letter of the 18th November. In their letter of the 28th October last, the Lords Commis sioners raised the question whether a light-buoy could not be substituted for the light-vessel proposed at the outer anchorage at Bushire, but the question of the light-buoy at the inner anchorage, recommended in the telegram of the Government of India, dated the 30th September last, was not thereby affected. No authority can be discovered for the statement of the Lords Commissioners that “ Bushire alone requires one lighted buoy as a matter of urgency.” On the contrary, it clearly appears from the telegram which they themselves quote thafifsuch buoys are urgently required at Bahrein and Bunder Abbas as w T ell, as is also shown in the list enclosed in my letter of 18th November. * Letters of 15th September and 18th November, 19LI. [2328 cc 56. The Secretary of State trusts that the foregoing explanations will remove the misapprehension which now exists. He concurs in the view that it is desirable that, so far as possible, His Majesty’s Government should be in possession of a complete scheme of the lighting and buoyage of the^Gulf before the project is actually proceeded with, but he trusts he has made it plain that in my letters of the loth September and the 18th November, taken in connection with the previous correspon dence, they already had such a scheme before them. There is only one item of the recommendations made by the committee of 1909 which has not been discussed in the telegrams from the Government of India or the letters addressed to your department viz., the provision of a depot for the maintenance of the lights and buoys. As your department is aware, the cost of the depot was estimated at 22,0001. by Mr. Hood in his supplementary report dealing with the financial aspects of the committee’s proposals. The matter has not been touched upon since, because it was necessar}’-, in the first instance, to settle the particular lights and buoys for the maintenance of which the depot would be required. As the committee’s scheme for lighting and buoyage was on a larger scale than that now proposed, it may be hoped that the cost of the depot will be less than the original estimate of 22,000h The point is dealt with in the telegram, dated the 23rd January, 1912, addressed to the Government of India, of which copy is transmitted. It will thus be seen that the only part of the scheme which has not been put before the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in my letter of the 15th September supplemented by that of the 18th November, is the depot. 7.

Treasury to Foreign Office.—(Received December 22.) Sir, Treasury Chambers, December 21, 1911. I HAVE laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Mallet’s letter of tbe 30tb ultimo, together with a copy of a letter from the India Office, dated the 18th November, which accompanied it, further respecting the buoyage and lighting of the Persian Gulf. My Lords gather from the India Office letter that the Secretary of State for India in Council is now of opinion that the places in the Persian Gulf where lighting and buoyage are most required are Bahrein, Bushire, Bunder Abbas, and Jask, and they note that the financial provision for these purposes would amount to an initial expenditure of 2,800Z. with a recurrent charge of 21OL per annum. It will be within the recollection of Secretary Sir E. Grey that in the Foreign Office letter, Secret, of the 11th October last, he, acting in accordance with the information furnished him by the India Office, represented to their Lordships the importance of providing for buoyage and lighting at Shat-el-Arab, Musandim, Tamb Island, Sheikh Shuaib, and Bushire on the ground that at these places exceptional circumstances rendered a provision of this character most urgently necessary, and in their reply of the 28th October last my Lords, with certain modifications, sanctioned the proposals put forward on the express understanding that the measures suggested were of urgent and pressing necessity, and that exceptional considerations from an international point of view had to be taken into account. It would now appear from the telegram dated the 30th September last from the Government of India that, of the places referred to in Foreign Office letter, Secret, of the 11th October last, Bushire alone requires one lighted buoy as a matter of urgency, and incidentally I am to point out that in their letter of the 26th October last my Lords had urged the substitution of a buoy for a light-ship, which had been suggested by the India Office as required at that place. Apart, however, from this particular point, I am to state that my Lords cannot but regard as highly unsatisfactory the whole method in which these proposals have been placed before Sir E Grey and themselves, and, in view of the discrepant and varying statements as to the places where provision of buoyage, &amp;c., is of primary importance, they are not disposed to sanction as a charge on the Exchequer the moiety of the expenditure proposed in the letter under reply, and they must further request that no action should be taken on the provisional sanction conveyed in their letter of the 26th October to the undertaking of various works referred to therein. When their Lordships are placed in possession of what may be taken as final and reasoned proposals for the lighting of the Persian Gulf, they will be prepared to give them their careful consideration, and, if necessary, to sanction a moderate expenditure for the purpose. Sir E. Grey is aware of their Lordships reluctance^ (which they feel sure he shares with them) to burthen the British tax-payer with expenditure for purposes so apparently remote, and. in their view, the sole justification for undertaking such charges must be imperative considerations of a political or commercial character. On the conflicting evidence before them they are not satisfied to what places in the Persian Gulf these considerations apply. I am, &amp;c. T. L. HEATH. [2294 y-1].This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government! EASTERN DEPARTMENT. \ h SECRET SERIES. [October 30.] Section 2. [42866] No. 1. Treasury to Foreign Office—(Received October 30.) Sir T ttavt7 w i-t t -j Treasury Chambers, October 28, 1911. Mv A d r e !? re ^ 01 l ds Commisslone i , s of His Majesty’s Treasury S yJf« i lettei of mstant, enclosing copy of a letter, dated the 15th rrfi f m /qV f° m In , dia 0ffice and a file of correspondence between various depart- ments of State relative to proposals for the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf. My Lords note that these proposals, if accepted in their entirety, will necessitate an early capital expenditure of a moiety of 47,600/., together with a‘recurrent annual chaige ot halt the maintenance charges, estimated at 2,490/., in respect of the light- houses, lighLvessels and buoys proposed for Shatt-el-Arab, Musandim, Tamb Island, r i Vu Sfi uai fi’ an fi Bushire. In addition, there is also a project for the purchase of a light-house tender, at a capital cost of 30,000/. and maintenance charges of 5,000/. per annum, but it is possible that the necessity for this may be obviated by the employ- inent of the cable-steamer “ Patrick Stewart,” at a cost, my Lords gather, of not less than 600/. per annum. ' b . Lords feel sure that Secretary Sir Edward Grey will be in full agreement with them m viewing with grave apprehension the undertaking of such heavy financial responsibilities as are now suggested. Large, too, as are the present demands, there appears little prospect, judging by the correspondence forwarded with the letter under reply, that they may be regarded as final. Further proposals for surveying and for le provision of light-houses, &amp;c., at other places in the Gulf seem more than probable, and my Lords therefore feel obliged at the outset to stipulate that if, in deference to the Secretary of State s strong representations, they acquiesce in some modified scheme, their assent is to be understood as only given where the circumstances are exceptional from an international point of view, and it must not be construed as an acceptance of the pohey of throwing upon the British taxpayer an indefinite burthen for the purpose of the general lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf. My Lords would be glad to be informed whether the Secretary of State’s state ment, that time does not permit of an international agreement being arrived at, whereby by means of dues the cost for lighting, &amp;c., might be recovered, is to be taken as precluding the possibility of an understanding between this country, Turkey, and Persia, with such an object in view as regards, at any rate, Shatt-el-Arab. Sir E. Grey is aware that a suggestion on these lines was made in the report of the sub-committee of the Imperial Defence Committee, and my Lords apprehend that, if nothing is done in this direction until after the completion of the proposed works, the difficulty of introducing a system of dues may be enhanced. My Lords will now proceed to deal with the separate proposals, and I am to say that, on the understanding that the provision of light-houses at Musandim, Tamb Island, and Sheikh Shuaib is of urgent and pressing necessity, they are willing that half the cost of construction and of maintenance charges shall be borne by the Exchequer. This will involve a capital expenditure for this country of 14,000/. and an annual charge of 575/. My Lords also agree to the provision of one acetylene gas buoy at inner bar, Shatt-el-Arab, in respect of which a capital cost of 300/. and an annual charge of 20/. will fall on Votes. As regards the provision of a light-vessel at Shatt-el-Arab, my Lords are not convinced that the heavy expenditure involved is necessary. They observe that it is proposed that this vessel should be stationed about 4 miles to seaward of the outer bar buoy at Shatt-el-Arab, as a Turkish light-vessel is or will probably be stationed near the buoy. In Bear-Admiral Sir E. Slade’s letter to the Admiralty, dated May 11, 1911, he states that a British vessel is “ not absolutely necessary,” though both he and the Admiralty think it desirable. My Lords, however, cannot feel that a sufficiently strong case has been made out for the purchase of this vessel, at a cost of 9,500/. and charges for upkeep of 650/. per annum, and they would urge that the proposal be It is also suggested that there should be a light-vessel at Bushire. Its cost and [2232 gg —2]2 upkeep are the same as in the above case. My Lords, however, note that in his letter of the 6th August, 1911, to the Government of India, Rear-Admiral Sir E. Slade states- as follows : “ From the experience gained of the light-buoy now established on tb outer bar of the Sbatt-el-Arab, it would seem that a similar buoy at Bushire in the outer anchorage would equally well serve all the purposes of navigation at the latter port.” The admiral goes on to say that a light-vessel would add more to British prestige than a light-buoy, but my Lords, whilst attaching due weight to this consider ation, cannot but feel that it scarcely justifies the enormous disparity in cost of purchase and upkeep between a light-vessel and a buoy. They are willing to agree to the purchase of a buoy, fitted as described in Admiral Slade’s letter, and they trust that this modification of the original proposal may meet with the Seeretarv of State’s support in view of the urgent necessity for economy. My Lords think that it would be premature to express their views as regards the second category of the proposals having reference to a light tender. They would be most reluctant to sanction so large an expenditure as 30,000/. for this purpose, with the high annual charge of 5,0001., and they trust that it may be found possible to employ the “ Patrick Stewart,” as has been suggested. If this be done, they are prepared to provide for half the expenses of hiring. I am, &amp;c.

Admiral leports that lights at Russian Consulate are visible over 12 miles, and that Alert, thinking lights were on British Consulate, anchored on night of 16th April but found next day she was south of where she supposed. Hitherto no notice has been published regarding Russian lights and there is consequent danger to shipping. Admiral recommends that two lanterns, similar to Koweit lanterns, be sent immediately for Bushire Residency, one lantern showing red the other white light. Notice to mariners should be published on arrival of lights. I approve Admiral’s proposal, with which Cox concurs, and asks that dioptric lanterns be s ent at onc e to Bushire by Store Department of India Office, as for Koweit. Cost of each lantern, exclusive of freight, is Rs. 916. 8, with monthly recurring charge of Rs. 10 for watchman and Rs. 5 for oil. Treasury will presumably be asked to bear moiety of expenditure. I further think that immediate representation should be made to Russian Government to direct Russian Consul at Bushire to discontinue lights as Russians have now no concern in Gulf lighting. ^ 1 2&lt;, J t/'W' Ju? 3Mrt yC^ £e^f. /% ry ^2h^\ (r f3 $• Copy of a telegram from Hie Sxoe^llenoy the laval Com- 'J~T^ mander-in-Chief, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, Ho.26,dated Bushire, the 18th April 1912. H.M.S. M Alert H which anchored at Bushire last night, 16th April (?) reports that the lights on the Russian Consulate are visible for over twelve miles. Being under the impression that lights were hoisted on the British Consulate,the ,f Alert w at day light discovered that she was anchored to the Southward of the place where she had supposed she was* Up to the present no notice to mariners has been published in connection with these lights and, if possible, it is advisable to avoid such notice being issued. The matter however cannot indefinitely be permitted to continue as at present, in view of the fact that vessels are utilising the Russian lights for the purpose of entering the anchorage,and the 'Alert's' experience goes to shew that there is danger if y*8«*hls vessels, endeavouring to enter the inner anchorage,make use of the Russian lights and the light givsn by the buoys which are now being placed. In consideration of what we are doing at present and have done in the past .with regard to the buoyage,survey,etc.,of the Gulf and in view of our position in the Gulf, it is submitted that it is extremely undesirable that the Russian lights should be allowed to remain as divided respon sibility as regards the lighting of the port is not safe. In the circumstances, it Is resoansndcd that two lante^i should,with all possible expedition, be sent to Bushire and hoisted on the flag staff of the tas town residency. These lanterns should be simi lar to that which is hoisted at Kuwait,but one of them should &gt;\ &lt; l. FT shew a white light. A notice to mariners should be published, when the lanterns arrive; the Russian lights being ignored in the meantime. Ultimately the Russian Government might be asked to cease hoisting their lights.

Sent to His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Constantinople, and repeated to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.' Repeated to Saral C oim andor~ in-CMef aSECRET. India Office, 25th January 1912. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 51,281, dated the 29th December last, requesting his observations on a letter from the Treasury, dated the 21st idem, regarding the expenditure on a scheme of lighting and buoyage in the Persian Gulf. 2. In i eply, 1 am to remark that the course of the recent correspondence is not accurately represented in the Treasury letter, and, in particular, the Secretary of State for India does not understand the allusion to “ the discrepant and varying statements as to the places where provision of buoyage, &amp;c., is of primary importance.” 3. In the letter of this Office, dated the 15th September last, it was recommended that sanction should be given to expenditure amounting, according to the most accurate data obtainable, to — £ Initial - - - - _ 47,600 Annual, recurring - - - _ 2,490 for the provision of— (1) an acetylene gas buoy, and one light-vessel in the Shatt-al-Arab; (2) lighthouses at Musandim, Tanb Island, and Shaikh Shuaib Island ; and (3) a light-vessel for Bushire. It was also explained (in paragraph 4) that some additional buoys might be necessary, as to which enquiry was being made in a telegram addressed to the Government of India on the 13th September. 4. The second letter of this Office, dated the 18th November last, supple mented the first by recommending that the buoys in question (of which a list was given) should be actually laid, at an estimated cost of— £ Initial ----- 2,800 Annual, recurring - - - - - 210 For convenience of reference, prints of the two letters''' are herewith enclosed. * Letter of 15th September 1911, with statement of lights. Letter of 18th bTovember 1911, with list of buoys. (In duplicate). 5. With regard to what is said in the Treasury letter as to the lighting of Bushire, I am to invite attention to Committee, dated the 29th April 1909, paragraph 9 of the Report of the from which it will be seen that they recommended— (1) a light-vessel at the outer anchorage ; (2) a lighted buoy at the inner anchorage. The former was included in the statement enclosed in the letter of this Office, dated the 15th September, the latter in the list of buoys accompanying the letter of the 18th November. In their letter of the 28th October last, the Lords Commissioners raised the question whether a light buoy could not be substituted for the light-vessel proposed at the outer anchorage at The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.29 Bushire, but the question of the light buoy at the inner anchorage, recom mended in the telegram of the Government of India, dated the oOth September last, was not thereby affected. No authority can be discovered for the statement of the Lords Commissioners that “ Bushire alone requires one lighted buoy as a matter of urgency.” On the contrary, it clearly appears from the telegram which they themselves quote, that such buoys are urgently required at Bahrein and Bunder Abbas as well, as is also shown in the list enclosed in my letter of 18th November. 6. The Secretary of State trusts that the foregoing explanations will remove the misapprehension which now exists. He concurs in the view that it is desirable that, so far as possible, His Majesty’s Government should be in possession of a complete scheme of the lighting and buoyage of the Gulf before the project is actually proceeded with, but he trusts he has made it plain that in my letters of the 15th September and the 18th No vember, taken in connection with the previous correspondence, they abeady had such a scheme before them. There is only one item of the lecommenda- tions made by the Committee of 1909 which has not been discussed in the telegrams from the Government of India or the letters addressed to your Department, viz., the provision of a depot for the maintenance of the lights and buoys. As your Department is aware, the cost of the depot was was estimated at 22,0001. by Mr. Hood in his Supplementary Report dealing with the financial aspects of the Committee’s proposals. The matter has not been touched upon since because it was necessary, in the first instance, to settle the particular lights and buoys for the maintenance of which the depot would be required. As the Committee’s scheme for lighting and buoyage was on a larger scale than that now proposed, it may be hoped that the cost of the depot will be less than the original estimate of 22,0001 The point is dealt with in the telegram* * Dated 23rd January 1912. , , p T j * addressed to the Government oi India, of which copy is transmitted. It will thus be seen that the only part of the scheme which has not been put before the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in my letter of 15th September, supplemented by that of the 18th November, is the depot. 7. Their Lordships will now be aware that the total expenditure on the complete scheme is estimated not to exceed — £ 102,400 Initial - - - Annual, recurring 7,700 made up as follows :— Initial. Annual, recurring. Proposals for lights recommended in India £ £ Office letter of 15th September 1911 47,600 2,490 Lighthouse Tender (proposed in same letter if less costly arrangements impracticable) Proposals for buoys recommended in India 30,000 5,000 Office letter of 18th November 1911 2,800 210 Depot—probably less than 22,000 (I v chided in figures above.) Total _ _ _ 102,400 7,700^ Sir Edward C^rov is aware, it was the extreme desirability of anticipating the possible action of other Powers that has all along caused this Office to press this scheme upon His Majesty’s Government. It is therefore hoped that the Lords Commissioners will, in view of the political considerations involved, no longer think it necessary to withhold their sanction, but will accept as a charge against British revenues a moiety of the expenditure estimated as above, on the distinct understanding that everv effort will be made to avoid or reduce the expenditure on the tender and the depot, and that the suggestions made in their letter of the 28th October 1911, will, if possible, be adopted.
