About the middle of September 1937 the Shaikh received a letter from Hajji Abdullah in which he wrate ab&amp;ut oil ana promised to send a motor car to the Shaikh. The Shaikh wrote a letter to Hajji Abdullah which he sent to Abdur Rahman Falknaz, his agent at Dubai, for despatch by air mail to Basrah.

Care was taken to ensure that the Enable translc-tions were identical with the phraseology used in the case of Dubai, with the necessary alteration of names. 3. The Residency Agent has now; reported that he delivered the correspondence to the Shaikh on the 5th January 1938, and that the Shaikh attempted to evade sending a reply, pretending that the Political Agreement and the first letter did not coincide with the drafts which he had been shown before. The Residency Agent states (Signature) +T . t / ' ( Designation )(To) that it was only with great difficulty that he succeeded in the Shaikh has used the phrasing of the approved Draft 2, but has made one minor amendment and has added a sentence which /« should not be there* Before therefore proceeding sendia® Di . r&gt; fc should be accepted. The 3haikh having 'taken notice of the conditions set out in my letter and having agreed to them' the final sentence of his letter can, I think, be ignored as meaningless in effect. On the other hand it might conceivably be argued that this final sentence vitiates the agreement ex pressed earlier in his letter. If that view is held it will be necessary to return the letter to him and insist on the excision of this sentence. This involves firm treatment and T would request instructions whether you would prefer me to fly to Sharjah for the purpose or to instruct Captain Galloway to deal with the matter* If, however, the view is accepted that the interpolated sentence does not have the effect of vitiating the Shaikh' s agreement then I will proceed to issue Draft !

The Shaikh’s promise to Gaptain Hickinbotham that he would send the letter in question, was of a most categorical nature as I have confirmed from the latter. 5. If Shaikh writes the correct letter within say a week of Captain Galloway’s communication to him well and good. If he is still obdurate, however, we must consider what line of action to take. There would appear to he the following courses open (a) I would have to report the matter to His Majesty's Government and could propose to them that, as the Shaikh had refused to recognize the Political agreement, and since the Concession between Company and the Shaikh depended for His Majesty’s Government’s sanction on such recognition, the Concession would lapse temporari ly until such recognition was forthcoming. This would mean that, thou^i the Company have paid the Shaikh his lump sum down, they v/ould cease to pay him the monthly payment of Es.2500/-. This might bring him to heel. (b) I would report the matter to His Majesty’s Government and merely state that local pressure v/as being brought to bear on the Shaikh, and that I would report the result. These local measures would be \ v ic) stoppage of travel papers. (d) If the Shaikh did not comply immediately we would have to shift the Trucial Gathering from s harj*ah- 3 . is) -r-S) : !)

If the Shaikh^ gathering for any reason could not be held at Debai, then we could announce to all the Trucial Shaikhs that ovdng to the Shaikh of Sharjah having broken his promise to His Majesty*s Government, the gathering could not be held and they consequently and their people would be de prived of their enjoyment on account of the breach of faith by the shaikh of Sharjah, ie) Should the Shaikh still prove obdurate, then we shall have to get sanction from His lAajesty*s Government to deal with his pearling fleet. 6* In addition to getting the Shaikh to sending the necessary letter, there is a matter of principle involved, and if we let the Shaikh get away with it, and not act up to his word, the general effect on the Trucial Coast will be unfortunate. 7. It may be that the Shaikh will produce the correct letter straight away, and all the above may not be necessary, but in view of the delay involved in commuuicating between here and Bahrain and vice versa I thought it oeat ? in case of eventualities, to save time by considering possible measures now. llease consider them and have your opinions ready in case of need® 8.

In regard to the line of action to be followed I think it would be well not to adopt course (a) in paragraph 5 of your letter. It is deducable that the Shaikh’s stand over a minor point and his deliberate refusal to understand the explanations given indicate that he would be glad to rid himself of all obligations imposed by the Concession. Personally I would prefer the course suggested (SignUuie) in/- ( Designation)in sub-paragraphs (b) to (e).

Apart from the particular instance of tne Shaikh of Sharjah breaking nis promise, there is a general attitude of obstruction and opposition to His Majesty’s aovarnaent, both latent and patent, amongst tne snaliens of tne Trucial Coast at the present juncture, which is causing me some concern. The Shaikh of Has &amp;1 Kraimah, far instance, was guilty some time ago of an act of extreme discourtesy to one of His Majesty’s Sloops, and naa refused to send a letter of regret to tne Senior is aval Officer. In consequence of this I have informed him that he will not receive tne good offices of His Majesty’s Government, which includes tne facilities of his travel papers. Some months tave passed by since he was informed of this, but hitherto ne has been obdurate. The various other Shaikhs, as you are aware, are adopting an extremely obstructive attitude towards tne entirely reasonable terms of Petroleum Concessions Limited.

We agree that in the light of the difficulties which the Company have experienced in their negotiations with the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast for the grant of oil concessions it would he best to leave matters in abeyance for say six months and we are prepared to advise the Company accordingly. We are, however, somewhat concerned as to the possibility of a difficult situation arising if, at the end of the waiting period, the Company again fail, through no fault of their own, to obtain concessions from the remaining/ m’ble Lieutenant Colonel Sir Irenehard Fowle, KCIE., CBE., H.B.M.’s Consulate-General, Bushire.remaining Sheikhs, and we should Toe glad to have your considered views on this aspect of the matter, togetner with an indication of the line of policy thau you would 3 Ugg 0 S , t should Ids followed in that event botn in relation t 0 the Sheikhs concerned and in regard to possible pressure / from competitors^ (such as the California Company) of Petroleum Concessions Limited for permission to negotiate. In this connection we have been considering Lewisohn’s suggestion that our insistence on having the co-operation of the Sheikh in regard to the Political A greements between His Majesty’s Government and the Company may have something to do with the Sheikhs’ refusal to come to terms and we should be glad to have your opinion on the point, you consider that there is something in it, or tha.t the somewhat complex arrangements for exchanging notes with the Sheikbe relative to the Political Agreement are liable to arouse misunderstanding or suspicion in their minds, it might be advisable, following the recent precedent of Musca t , to c onsider whether there are any points in the Agreement itself, or - more particularly' - in the complementary Exchanges of Motes, which might be modified3. or simplified, without materially lessening the value of those documents, so as to make them more acceptable to the She ikte concerned; for example, is there any real necessity to require the Sheikh to obtain our approval in regard to the setting up of a Bank ? ’'e should be glad to have your views on this suggestion. In the last resort we should be prepared, if you consider that the circumstances justify it and that the Company s prospects of clinching matters would be substantially increased thereby, to consider, in consultation with the other interested Departments of His Majesty's Government, whether we can take the risk of dispensing altogether with the Sheikh's co-operation in the Political Agreement between the Company and Kis liajesty’s ^overnmen^.

My dear Fowle, With reference to my demi-official letter No. P.Z. 3639/38 of the 28th May regarding the 'concession hunting' side of Petroleum Concessions Limited’s activities on the Trucial Coast woul &gt;u kindly refer to the last paragraph of Gibson’s nCTte’ of his conversation with Ballantyne on P 1st June, (on the subject of the Bahrein Unallotted Area) a copy of which was sent to you by mail of 4th June. We do not know, of course, how far Ballantyne’s hint of renewed interest in the Trucial Coast is to be taken seriously but the mere fact that he has mentioned the matter at this time emphasises the importance of our being prepared to meet a serious demand on the part of the Standard Oil Company to enter the 'Trucial Coast Field'. As regards the last sentence of Gibson’s note I do not think that we have heard previously that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi objected to the 'Political Agreement'.

P.Z. 3 dated the 28th May 1938 and P.Z. 3639/38 ‘dated the 8th June 1938, on the subject of concessions in the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms. 2. Two separate points are raised in these letters, namely (i) the policy to be adopted in the event of the remaining Shaikhs refusing to grant concessions to P.C.L. after an interval and/or in the event of possible pressure from competitor companies; and (ii) the possibility of modi fying the Political .Agreement or dispensing with the Shaikhs formal adherence thereto. I attach to this letter separate notes on these two questions. 'he Honourable Lieutenant-Coloenl Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, C/O Postmaster, Karachi. P10 rs •f* Yours sincerely,POLICY IN THE EVENT OF OBDURACY ON THE PART OF SHAIKHS OR OF COMPETITION BY OTHER COMPANIES • The essential factor to remember here is that His Majesty* s Government have authorised the issue of an ulti matum to all the Trucial Coast Shaikhs informing them in so many words that they may negotiate oil concessions v/ith P.C.L. and with no other company # It has been reported from time to time that some of the Shaikhs believe this pronouncement to be 'wind' and it is needless to argue again how devastating from the position taken up. I can conceive only one circum stance which would justify the withdrawal of the ultimatum, and that would be a publicly proclaimed statement that P.C.L. had forfeited the confidence of His Majesty's Government and were therefore no longer considered suitable concessionaires on the Trucial Coast; but that such a proclamation might be made can scarcely enter into the field of practical politics* Thus the position is that vis-a-vis the Shaikhs His Majesty's Government are, as it seems to me, finally committed. 2. The question arises whether other political considera tions may arise of such overwhelming weight that His Majes ty's Government must yield to-them in spite of the inevita ble loss of control of a large section of the Arab Coast in the Persian Gulf, and in spite of the danger that that in volves to Imperial interests. At the presant moment the only competitor company that need be considered seriously is the California Company. I have suggested in another connection that if, as seems inevitable, His Majesty's Government allow this Company, through its subsidiary the Bahrain Petroleum Company, to obtain a concession over practically the whole the result would be in loss of prestige and political control on the Trucial Coast if His Majesty's Government resiled of/-4 /- - 2 - of the Bahrain Unallotted Area, they may be able t o make considerable capital thereby for their dealings with the Company in respect of the Trucial Coast. 1 suggest that there are the following reasons for believing that the ar gument so developed should be decisive: (a) One may doubt if the California Company could count on active support from the United States Government in any demand for an open field on the Trucial Coast, owing to the existence of 'strained relations' between the President of the Unitedjstates and the big oil companies. The impression that I have gathered here is that the California Company would not expect support from their own Government except in circumstances such as the sequestration of property which they already own, e.g. in Saudi Arabia. In any event the Ame rican component of P.C.L. (which I understand is actually stronger than California Standard) would presumably have not less influence in Washington and could be counted on to nul lify any attempt by the California Company to enlist United States Government support. (b) I very much doubt if the California Company would take the risk of offending us by indulging in the very problemati cal effort to obtain the support of their own Government in opposition to British interests. They realise only too well their dependence in the Persian Gulf on British protection and, in their present circumstances, I have reason to know that they do not exclude the possibility of having to ask for that protection on the Hasa Coast if Ibn Saud^ death is followed by anarchy 6n the mainland. 3. I am aware that past history does not altogether sup port my contention, but it is a matter for consideration how far American pressure in regard to Kuwait, for instance, was due to the presence in England of an American Ambassador who was himself one of the great 'oil kings'.4. I have no doubt that the California Company will continue to 'make passes' (to use one of their own phrases) in the Trucial Coast direction, but I do not believe that those 'passes' need be taken over seriously. So far as Mr. Ballantyne’s show of renev/ed interest in the Trucial Coast is concerned, it seems more than probable from the timing of his hint that it was no more than a move in the Bahrain 5. How far one need take account of the possibility of competition from companies of less amiable nationality I do not of course know, but at least there are no obvious indi cations of it so far. (One can now I think safely deride the Pastori - Diba scare.) I believe it would not be over petition locally, but I prefer not to commit my ideas to paper unless and until the necessity actually arises. 6. In brief, therefore, I hold to the view that no devia tion from our present policy need be considered in the visible future, and that, given freedom from major world disturbances, it should be perfectly feasible to rely on 'mental attrition' tactics against the Shaikhs for at least the next tv/o years, game. whelmingly difficult in the last resort to counter such com should this be necessary. o0o=5/- 7 ^ POSSIBLE MODIFICATION OF THE POLITICAL AGREEMENT OR EXCLUSION OF THE SHAIKHS* CO-OPERATION THEREAFTER- The adherence of the Shaikhs to the Political Agreement between His Majesty* s Government and P.C.L. has, I presume, hitherto been regarded as necessary to provide a lever to ensure that the Company abide strictly by the provisions of the Agreement. As a measure of control over the Shaikh and his treatment of the Company it is of course unnecessary, tftngh it is true that the Company might lose by the disappearance of article 10 as part of an agreement accepted by the Shaikh concerned. 2. It seems to me that the essential articles in the Poli tical Agreement are Nos. 1 arcL 2 (read together), 9 and 11. All remaining articles can reasonably be held to be subsidiary to these four. 3. In so far as articles 1 and 2 are concerned, it could I think be held that the essential requisites can be met with the aid of the agreements given by the Trucial Coast Shaikhs in 1922 not to grant concessions to persons (which includes companies) except those 'appointed by the High Britfeh Govern ment'. What applies to the grant of a concession can reason ably be held to apply equally to its transfer. A further safe guard is provided by the article in the^(P.C.L.) eommercial agreement that 'the Shaikh agrees that the Company may transfer their concession to a British Company to be called Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited or to any other company registered within the British Empire ' Obviously however this safeguard is less effective than the 1922 Agreement. 4. As for article 9, and the pre-emption schedule, this can, one supposes, be regarded as unnecessary when one comes to practical facts. Whether or not there be a pre-emption clause at all, His Majesty’s Goveromant would undoubtedly take whatever oil they want in the event of war. standard7 4 2 5. Article 11 is, I think, really the crux of the situa tion. Though in point of fact it provides for arbitration, the question clearly arises from this article whether or not His Majesty's Government can impose their will on the Company without the aid of the Shaikh. It seems to me that there are two safeguards, one at present existing and one vhich must come i •———- o/ _ in course of time. The former is the approximate 50% British capital in the Company and the latter will be the inevitable Order-in-Council which must in time be applied to each of the ■ Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms in which the Company operates. Should His Majesty's Government find that the Company deliberately contravenes the terms of the agreement between them, it seems to me that they could rely being able to take action against the property of the Company in the Sheikhdom concerned through the powers conferred by an Order-in-Council on the local poli tical authorities. 6. I do not for one moment think that any modification in the Political Agreement or in the method of e xchapge of notes with the Shaikhs concerned, cumbersome though it undoubtedly is, would have any useful result on negotiations so long as the Shaikhs are required to adhere to some form of Political I think Agreement. It is/true tore to say that our insistence on the Shaikhs* adherence to the Political Agreement is an impediment to the Companji* s negotiations for commercial agreements, though it would be entirely w rong tolsuggest that the exclusion of the Shaikhs entirely from the Political Agreement would b e a panacea for all difficulties. Putting it briefly, if it is accepted that His Maj esty' s Government can ensure the Company's strict observance of the Political Agreement without dragging in the Shaikhs then it is well worth while to omit the Shaikhs from i^ since negotiations for commercial agreements should be quite uonsiderably facilitated thereby, even though the immediate satisfactory conclusion of negotiations should not be expected on this score alone.7. On the other hand the one thing which I do regard as most important is to insist on His Majesty’s Government’s approval to any Bank which might be st up in any Shaikh’s territory as a result of oil exploitation. A Bank is pe culiarly well situated for becoming the focus of hostile propaganda or intrigue, and it seems to me to be of the highest importance that if an when a Bank is established His Majesty’s Government should be satisfied that its finan cial stability is fully matched by the political soundness of its direction^Conf id ent ial Office of the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Karachi. 6th July 1938. D.O.HQ.C/427 Could you please refer to your letter Uo.P#Z. 3639, dated the 8th June 1938, on the subject of Petroleum Concessions Limited and the Trucial Coast. There are two points on which my views are required, the possible renewed interest of the Standard Oil Company in that area, and the question whetner the political agreement could be dropped vxs a vis the Shaikhs. As regaras xne first, 1 am replying in a separate letter; as re&amp;urds the second cuuiuients are as follows. 2. The main reasons for requiring a Shaikh to take cognisance of the politicalagreement are, as I understand it, with those of the political agreement, the latter shall prevail! (2) to provide a lever to ensure that the Company abiae by the provisions of that agreement. Both (1) and (2) are f^contained in (a) and (b) of paragraph 3 of letter Ho.T/1, yV*dated 22nd May 1937, from tiie Political Agent, Bahrain, to the shaikh of Debai, which has formed a model for agreements with the other Trucial shaikhs. 3. yith regard to (l). I presume tnat it would ce possible by careful e*aminatiun of the concesaivjn «na the political agreement to make sure thut no conflict can arise between the terms of the two documents. It was this over- riding clause that the ahaiJch of Sharjah, for instance, took gw of old: (1) that if the terms of the concession conflict exception/ •T. Peel, Bsquire, The India Office, Lond cm.exception to (vide my Express Letter Ho*c/71 # dated lotii February 1938J, though finally he agreed. 4. With regard to (2). This entitles the shaikh in certain eventualities to terminate the agreement between the Company and himself, but does not force him to do so at our request. So the lever, from our point of view, is not perhape/ae strong as it might be. On the other hand irrespective of the aid of this lever tne Company is not lixely to run counter to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. Further, in case of necessity His Majesty’s Government could presumably enforce at law in the United Kingdom the terms of the political agreement. Lastly but not least important, when and if the Company begin large scale operations on the Trucial Coast, an Order in Council, (or Orders in Council), as at qatar, will have to be made, and if necessary the Company could be proceeded against on the spot as a British Corp or at ion. 5. I do not think that the political agreement has actually prevented the remaining Shaikhs of tne frucial Coast from granting concessions bux it is probable tnat they have viewed it with some suspicion, ana have at any rate seized on it as an excuse for not coming to terms with the Company. similarly, the latter have quoted the political agreement as one of the causes which have prevented them from obtaining their concessions. If the political agreement were out of the way neither Company nor shaikhs would have this excuse. 6. In all the circumstances and on the balance of advantages I tnink the beat course to pursue would be to retain/retain of course the political agreement as between His Government and the Company, but not to require its cognisance by the Shaikhs. 7. fith reference to the question of requiring a shaikh to obtain our approval in regard to the setting up /of a bank, vide Political Agent, Bahraini letter Ho.T/2 n 1/ V 0 f 22nd May 1937 to the shaikh of Hebai. It would of course be preferable to obtain this undertaking in order to prevent the establishment of, say, a wholly foreign bank. On the other hand, we have already ensured against this happening in the two most important Shaikhdoms of the frucial Coast, Debai and Sharjah. Further^ Article 25 of the Concession stipulates that the Shaikh shall consult the Company as to the choice of a Bank, and I imagine that the Company would have a good deal of influence over the activities of any bamc actually established. Lastly since the main factor in the situation is that petroleum Concessions Limited should obtain their concessions, I think that on the whole It would be well to remove this last possible obstacle. I am of the opinion, therefore, that we shoula not insist on the proviso regarding the Bank. I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and Weightman.flonf identlal *' Offioe of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Gamp Karachi D.O.No.C/429 6th July 1938 Gould you please refer to my letter No.C/427 of the 6th July 1938 in which I promised to give my views on the possible renewed interest of the Standard Oil Company on the Trucial Coast. 2. The whole essence of this aspect of Trucial Coast Oil is the »ultimatum* delivered py His Majesty’s Government in xheir telegram ho. 1674, detect 17th June 1937 # In paragraph b of my .express Letter No.C/58, dated loth ultimatum, I thought should be pres seat i.e. that tne Shaikhs should be left alone. I am still of the same opinion. would have a most unfortunate effect on our prestige not % only on the Trucial Coast but generally in the other Arab States of the Gulf, where of course it will become known. I am therefore definitely of opinion that we must adnere to the 'ultimatum*. I have been partly influenced by the necessity of this in making the suggestions in my letter quoted in paragraph 1 above^ with a view to rendering tne detaining of concessions by Petroleum Concessions Limited as easy as possible. 4.

In the first place, though here I am speaking of something quite outside my sphere, I do not imagine that at the present time *Big Business** in the shape of the standard Oil of California would get much support from the American Government in regard to any scixeraes which they may have in regard to the 'frucial Coant. In the second place there is already an American element (standard Oil Company of Mew York ?) in petroleum Concessions Limited, which gives His Majesty^ Government a very good reply to any accusation that tney axe keeping American interests out of the frucial Coast. Moreover the /marican interests in Petroleum Concessions Limited would I imagine, if necessary throw their weight againex their competitors, the standard i Oil, should the latter ask for the assistance of the American Government. J*urther, the standard Oil Company of California, as represented oy the Bahrain petroleum Company, are anxious to stand well with His Majesty's Government. In these circumstances therefore, if the Standard Oil Company of California do approach His Maj esty’s Government for permission to enter the ?rucial Coast, I think that His Majesty's Government would be in a position to inform them politely but firmly that this permission would not be forthcoming. v * I am sending copies of tnis letter to Metcalfe and veightman.By Air Mail.

Arabian Peninsula. {Prepared in the Petroleum Department, June 1938.)— {Received in Foreign Office, June 11.) General. FOR the purposes of this summary the Arabian Peninsula may be said to lie south of a line joining Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea to Koweit at the northern end of the Persian Gulf. Included in this area are the following States, sheikhdoms or territories, in most of which petroleum concessions have been, or are likely to be, obtained :— (A) Under British sovereignty or protection— Koweit. Bahrein. Qatar. Trucial Sheikhdoms— Ajman. Abu Dhabi. Debai. Ras-al-Khaimah. Sharjah. Umm-al-Quwaim. Aden Colony. Aden Protectorate. (B) Independent States— Saudi Arabia— (i) Red Sea Area. (ii) Nejd— {a) Hasa. {b) Remainder of Nejd. The Yemen. Muscat and Oman^ 1 ) (C) Miscellaneous— Koweit Neutral Zone. Petroleum Concessions {Limited). 2. As Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are interested in the majority of the above-mentioned territories it has been thought worth while to include in this summary a short note on the genesis and composition of the company. 3. The company, which was first registered in October 1935, is a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the change of name was decided upon in order to facilitate the securing of concessions outside Iraq. The whole of the shares in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are held by the same interests and in the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the boards of the two companies are similarly composed, except that the Board of Petroleum (9 His Majesty’s Government exercise by custom only a considerable degree of influence over the affairs of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 9918 [330 1—1] BBM 2 i°l ■ Concessions (Limited) does not include an Iraqi Government Director. Lord Cadman is chairman of both companies. The shareholding of the Iraq Petroleum Company is divided as follows :—- Percentage. British— Anglo-Iranian Oil Company ... ... ... 23-75 Dutch— Royal Dutch Shell 23 -75 French— Compagnie Francaise des Petroles ... ... 23-75 American— Near East Development Company (i.e., Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum in the proportion of 50-50) ... ... ... 23-75 Participation and Investments (Limited)— C. S. Gulbenkian ... ... ... ... ... 5 00 100 00 Koweit. 4. The concession for this territory is held by the Koweit Oil Company (Commercial Agreement, dated the 23rd December, 1934; Political Agreement,( 2 ) dated the 5th March, 1934), the capital of which is held jointly by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of America (Mellon Group). 5. One well was put down on the north side of Koweit Bay, but only small quantities of oil were found. Another well has been drilled at Burgan, south of Koweit Bay, and was successful in striking oil. Koweit Neutral Zone. 6. The boundaries between Koweit and Nejd were settled at the Uquair Conference of November 1922, when certain territory was recognised as common to these two States. Under this settlement the Rulers of Koweit and Nejd were to enjoy equal rights in the zone until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived M between them. Consequently, neither Ruler can grant an oil concession in the zone without the consent of the other. 7. Matters in regard to oil negotiations in the Neutral Zone have, in consequence, reached a deadlock. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) cannot move because the Sheikh of Koweit, to whom application has been made, refuses to grant an option in respect of his share of the oil rights in the zone, since he considers that he is entitled to all the rights in the zone and hopes to obtain them when Ibn Saud dies. Petroleum Concessions (Limited), however, have been informed by the Sheikh of Koweit that he will, if he changes his mind, inform them before any other company. On the other hand, Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, who is now thought to favour exploitation of the zone by a British company, is committed to the Standard Oil Company of California by reason of a special agreement with that company, under which they received a preferential position in respect of Ibn Saud’s rights in the zone much the same as that which they received in regard to the unallotted areas in Nejd (see paragraphs 24-28 below). Bahrein. 8. Oil development in Bahrein is being undertaken by the Bahrein Petroleum Company (Limited) under a lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein on the 29th December, 1934, and modified on the 3rd June. 1936. The lease covers practically the whole of the Island of Bahrein, and runs for a period of fifty-five years from the 1st January, 1935. Up to the end of 1937 58 wells had been drilled or were about to be drilled, 33 were producing, and 14 were shut-in. Production during 1937 amounted to approximately 1,108,894 tons. ( 2 ) -By 11 Political Agreement is meant in this memorandum an agreement between the concessionary company and His Majesty’s Government, to which the Ruler concerned is usually an assenting party, by which the company undertakes not to transfer the concession to non-British interests and to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government generally.'■M.rriHTuawM HHIliHHHHi 9. Negotiations in respect of the area belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but not allotted to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in their lease, have been carried on between the sheikh on the one hand and both Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, on the other, but so far without definite result. 10 The Bahrein Petroleum Company was incorporated in Canada in 1929, the whole of the share capital being subscribed by the Standard Oil Company of California. In 1936 an agreement was reached between the Standard Oil Company and the Texas Corporation, whereby the latter company obtained a half interest in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As the Texas Oil Corporation has markets in various Eastern countries, this arrangement secures an outlet for the refined products obtained from the refinery recently erected in Bahrein. Qatar. 11. The oil rights in this territory were originally granted to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the 17th May, 1935. A political agreement was entered into on the 5th June, 1935. The agreement, which runs for a term of seventy-five years, was transferred to Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) (the operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in Qatar) on the 5th February, 1937. Geological survey work has been carried out and arrangements have been made to commence deep drilling operations in the autumn of 1938. 12. Considerable difficulty has arisen between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government with regard to the boundaries between Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Ibn Sand claims a frontier which in effect overlaps the limits of the concession held by Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) and indicated in the map attached to the concession. His Majesty’s Government do not admit Ibn Saud’s claim, but have offered him a frontier which, while lying to the south of the Qatar concession boundary, is nevertheless beyond what they regard as the legal limit laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. The Trucial Sheikhdoms. 13. The position in the Trucial States is as follows :— 14 A jman. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) held an option giving them the exclusive right to explore for oil in this territory for a period of two years. The option period expired on the 22nd January, 1938, but the company have so far failed to induce the sheikh to grant an oil concession. 15. Abu Dhabi. —The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 3rd January, 1938. Negotiations for a concession were recently suspended as the sheikh is proving difficult. 16. Debai. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this territory for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 22nd May, 1937, and Political Agreement dated the 5th February, 1937). No work has so far been carried out. 17. Ras-al-Khaimah. —The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 1st August, 1937. A political agreement, preceding the conclusion of a commercial agreement, was signed on the 25th March, 1938. Negotiations for the latter are in suspense. 18. Sharjah. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this area for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 17th September, 1937; Political Agreement signed the 12th November, 1937). 19. Umm-al-Quwaim. —No option or concession has yet been obtained in respect of this territory, but the sheikh recently informed Petroleum Concessions (Limited) that he was “ willing to negotiate.’' Aden Protectorate. 20. An application for an oil exploration licence in respect of this territory has been made by Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and also jointly by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have priority, and the Protectorate authorities have been recommended to grant that company an exclusive exploration permit for a term of two years, after which the other companies could be given an exclusive permit in respect of the territory not retained by Petroleum Concessions (Limited). A draft of the exploration permit has been agreed between the Colonial Office and the [330 1—1] b 2company, and sent to the Governor for consideration. In the meantime, Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have been given permission to send an exploration party to the Protectorate (see also note under “ Muscat and Oman '). Saudi Arabia: (i) Red Sea Area. 21. The petroleum rights in this area were granted to Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 9th July, 1936. The concession runs for a period of sixty years and covers the whole of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia to a depth of 100 kilom. (together with the Farsan and other islands and territorial waters). Prospecting work has been carried out by Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) —the local operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) but with the exception of the Farsan Islands and a very small stretch of the coast the results have been disappointing. Saudi Arabia: (ii) ~Nejd. 22. (a) Hasa. —The oil rights in this area were conceded to the Standard Oil Company of California by Ibn Saud on the 27th May, 1933. The con cession has since been transferred to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, a subsidiary company, the share capital of which is wholly owned by Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation equally. The concession runs for a period of sixty years. The area of the concession as set out in the relevant article of the concession agreement is as follows : “ All of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters), westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north, 30 degrees west, to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south, 30 degrees east, to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia.” 23. Drilling has been carried out by the company and some oil has been found. It has recently been reported that a well giving 3,400 barrels of oil per day has been brought in. Some of the oil from Hasa is being taken to Bahrein for refining. It is also understood that plans for the development of a port on the Flasa coast are under consideration and that the necessary chart will shortly be prepared by the Admiralty on the basis of information supplied bv the company as the result of a survey carried out by them. 24. (b) Remainder of Nejd. —The position as regards oil exploration rights in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea area or Hasa aiea concessions, referred to above, is uncertain. It was believed at the time that the Hasa concession agreement had been supplemented by a special agreement or “ secret clause,” giving the Standard Oil Company of California some kind of an option on this territory, but details were lacking. 25. Information has recently been received, however, which points to the probability that on the 29th May, 1933, the Saudi Arabian Government and the company agreed upon a modified form of the concession signed on the 27th May (referred to in paragraph 22), the modifications consisting of the addi tion of two extra articles, numbered respectively 3 and 7, which have been inserted in their appropriate positions in the body of the original agreement of the 27th May, the subsequent articles being appropriately renumbered, and a revised version of the (renumbered) article 35. 26. The effect inter alia of these additional articles (or special agreement) is to accord to the Standard Oil Company of C alifornia “a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area {i.e., the Hasa concession area) as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations.” His Majesty’s Government are not at present aware whether or where this “ contact line ” has been established. There is presumably an area uncovered by any concession or preference rights between the “ contact line,” wherever that may be, and the eastern boundary of the Red Sea concession.mammm (\cF 5 27. A further provision is that the Standard Oil Company of California shall have the right to recover “by means of deductions from one-half of the royalties due to the Government' the amount of two loans totalling £50.000 gold received by the Saudi Arabian Government from the company. 28. On the same date as the conclusion of this modified agreement letters Gere exchanged by the company and the Saudi Arabian Government defining the company’s preference rights in regard to (a) “ the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia ” referred to in paragraph 26 above, and (b) the Koweit Neutral Zone (see paragraph 7 above). The effect of these preference rights in (a) is to entitle the company to acquire an oil concession on terms equal to those which may be offered to the Saudi Arabian Government by another company. If the Standard Oil Company of California elect not to exercise their right, the Saudi Arabian Government is free to accept the other company’s offer. Otherwise, the Standard Oil Company of California’s preference right shall continue at least so long as the provisions of the special agreement remain in force. The Yemen. 29. No concession has so far been obtained in this territory owing to the attitude of the Imam Yahya, who opposes the exploitation of his country by foreign interests. The French interests in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have, how ever, been successful in inducing the Imam to permit two geologists to visit the Yemen for a period of six months. Muscat and Oman. 30. Two concessions^) have been obtained from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman by Petroleum Concessions (Limited), one in respect of Muscat and Oman except the district of Dhofar and the other in respect of Dhofar. Both commer cial agreements are dated the 24th June, 1937, and run for a period of seventy- five years. The Sultan at first showed himself averse from being associated in any way with any political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the company. This question was, however, discussed with the Sultan during his visit to this country in April of this year, and the Sultan in the end agreed to be associated with such an agreement in a modified form. 31. An aerial exploration which it is hoped to carry out in the eastern portion of the Aden Protectorate will probably include the western portion of Muscat and Oman. Refinery Agreement with Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 32. A general Refinery Agreement was entered into between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 5th February, 1937. Briefly, the agreement provides that whenever the production of crude oil in the areas over which the company hold, or may hold, oil concessions in the Persian Gulf area reaches a total of 500,000 tons per annum, the company shall erect, on a site to be agreed, a refinery or refineries with a total capacity of not less than 250,000 tons per annum, unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government that this would be precluded by commercial considerations. The agreement also provides for a re-examination of the question of the refinerv | capacity in the event of the total annual production exceeding 1 million tons per annum. Rre-em'ption of Oil in the Event of an Emergency. 33. The political agreements entered into between His Majesty’s Govern ment and Petroleum Concessions (Limited), in respect of the concessions secured the company in Qatar, Debai, Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah, provide, inter Ma, that in the event of a state of national emergency or war (of the existence °fi which His Majesty’s Government shall be the sole judge) His Majesty’s Govern- Nent shall have the sole right of pre-emption of all crude oil obtained under the concessions and of all the products thereof. His Majesty’s Government have also the right to require the company to the extent of any refining capacity it may have (*) (*) A separate concession may be granted by the Sultan later for his Asiatic territory, l,e 'i txwadur.r - . •; 5 * lf[H ! 0iies plior in each State (but see the preceding paragraph defining the refinery position) to produce oil fuel that shall comply with the Admiralty specifications at the time, provided that the oil is of a suitable kind and quality for this purpose, and to take control of the company's works, plant and premises. Similar provisions appear in the political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Koweit Oil Company. In the case of Muscat and Oman pre-emption will nc^ be provided for in the modified form of political agreement with which the Sultan will be associated (see note under Muscat and Oman above) but in a separate agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 34. No political agreement was entered into between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Bahrein Petroleum Company in respect of the concession in Bahrein (nor is pre-emption provided for in the lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein), but in view of the sheikh’s special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government it is not anticipated that any difficulty would occur in securing the pre-emption of Bahrein oil in the event of an emergency. ruder Petroleum Department, June 10, 1938ft l4806/P 89 2000 6.37 isied that in any further comm uni 's subject the under-mentioned letter m( ,y he quoted, and the reply pber fto- (»ier Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London, S.

Bear Mr. Peel, When this Company first went concession hunting on the Trucial Coast, it was decided provisionally not to approach the Shaikh of Kalba - who was at that time on the point of being recognised by H.M.C. as a separate unit - on the grounds that his territory was so situated as to have no oil interest. It does not seem certain, however, that this was a wise decision since Shaikh Khalid, the Regent of Kalba, seems to be a man of some personality who, besides controlling a considerable area of mountain territory, seems to possess influence on the Western side of the mountains also. In this connection the following passage occurs in a report dated May 10th 1938 from Bahrain :- M The R.A. informs me that Khalid, the regent of Kelba, has managed to get Fujairah and Dibah under his control. That is to say, they have sworn allegiance to him. This means that practically the whole of the Shamailyah is now dependent on Kelba. At the same time ¥adi n.1 Qor and Wadi Helu, sometimes known as ITadi Ham, have both recently paid tax to Khalid, instead of to Sheikh Sultan bin Salem as heretofore. Wadi Helu runs southwards from Khatt and joins Wadi A1 Cor in the vicinity west of the town of Kelba. Khalid has owned Dhaid for some time. It is believed that Khalid T s intentions are to re-unite the Qawasim territories in one sheikhdom under his own control. If Khalid is allowed to continue he might eventually succeed as he is universally liked. I called on Khalid several times/■M ~ 2 - times during last Ramadan at Adman, and afterwards cured him of malaria with Atebrin. Ke seemed a nice type of man and has sent me many messages since then* At the moment it looks as if Has A1 Khainah territory is now practically halved. Khalid is also friendly with the Bani Chittah^/' At the moment H.M.G-. are taking no action as regards Khalid's activities, although they are fully aware of the progress he is making.' I write now to ask: 1. Whether you feel any obdection to our approaching the Regent of Kalba in the same manner as other Trucial rulers if the local situation seems to call for this : 2. Whether you have any objection to our approaching, through him, tribes or places which one of the other Qasawim rulers has claimed or may claim, if he offers us mere effective assistance than they: 3* Whether, in your opinion, a concession from the Regent of Kalba can be taken as covering the whole of the Shumaliyah T v7hich of course includes Fujairah, Di'oah and other villages. As you will perhaps wish to consult your representatives in the Gulf, I am sending a copy of this letter to our Bahrain Office. Yours sincerely, ( Sd«) Stephen H. Longrigg. R. T.

As soon as Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad became Regent of* Kalba he established peace and order, all over Kalba terri- /If JfSr) f *■ tory (please see my letter dated 2nd Cctober 1937 paragraph 2 to Captain Hickinbotham) and the subjects of Kalba began to ply between Kalba and other places without being inter fered with by anyone. This caused the people of Wadi al Halu and Wadi al Qaur who are under Sharjah and las al Khai- mah respectively to go to Khalid and request him to consider them as his subjects. They took oath of allegiance to him. Shaikh Khalid promised to protect them and to do all that is possible to assist them but asked them to remain as be fore, namely, under their respective Shaikhs until the end of the present diving season when he will decide about their future de facto. 3. Shaikh Saif bin Hamad of Fujairah also took oath of allegiance to Shaikh Khalid who promised to help him in any manner he could but asked him to continue to exercise his authority as before until better arrangements could be made. 4. When Shaikh Rashid bin Ahmad, brother of Khalid and Shaikh of Diba, died on 29th December 1937, he was succeeded by his son Ahmad under the control of Shaikh Khalid. Shaikh Ahmad of Diba proved to be very weak and incapable of manag ing the affairs of Diba (Hasn). Shaikh Khalid, therefore, intends to make better arrangements at Diba and will, -pro bably, appoint a Wali, acting under the direct orders of Shaikh Khalid. By doing this the villages of Bidya, Sham,Dhadna, Ar-Eaul(2) and Ghurfa which are now dependent on Fu jairah but in the past were under Diba, will revert to Diba. 5. Shaikh Khalid ! s policy is to establish peace and order in all the Qawasimi territories and thus compel, by peaceful means, the people to submit to his rule end pay allegiance to him without using force, which his present financial position does not allow him to do, 6.

The infora&amp;tion from Bahrain quoted in Petroleum Concessions Limited* s letter is substantially correct. There is little doubt th&amp;t Shaikh Khalid does dream of the day when the whole of the ^swasimi territories will be re~united under one Shaikh, that Shaikh being himself. The inhabitants of the Wadi al Halu and the Wadi al Qaur hare taken oath of allegiance to him and he has promised to protect them and to assist them in any way possible, but has informed them that for the present they must remain under their respect ire Shaikhs (i.e. Sharjah and Has al Khaimah), until the end of the Airing season. Similarly Fujairah has taken oath of allegiance (Signature) to/2 - 1X0 to him, though Shaikh Khalid has told shaikh Saif bin Hamad that he should continue to exercise his authority “until better arrangements can be made M « In regard to Diba (Hasn) the present Shaikh is completely incapable, and the local expecta tion is that Shaikh Khalid will appoint a Wall to act under his own direct orders. 3. Hitherto Shaikh Khalid has acted with considerable circumspection and, whether from conriction or from shortage of funds, he has made no effort to extend his influence by forceful methods. At present he is universally popular and there is every possibility of his influence extending much more widely during the coming cold weather. 4. ,yith regard to the specific questions raised by Petroleum Concessions Limited, I have the following comments to makes (1) I see no objection to their approaching the Regent at Kalba in the same manner as the other Trueial Coast Rulers, but pending farther developments they should de&amp;l with him solely as the guardian of the minor Shaikh of Kalba. (2) Ho general sanction should be given in the terms stated by the Company. Presumably their immediate object is to obtain acoess to Jebel Faiyah through the good offices of Shaikh Khalid, and conceivably this will be the ultimate solution, nevertheless this particular question, (snd all similar questions) must be considered fully on its merits. I shall be addressing you separately regarding Jebel Faiyah. (3) It is essential to draw a clear distinction between Shaikh /: -3- Shaikh Khalid as Regent of Kalba and Shaikh Khalid as the potential Ruler of a combined qawasazni Sheikhdom. At the moment Petroleum Concessions Limited, can oril v * dc&amp;j vvitn nim in his former capacity and a Kalba concession would therefore cover only recognised Kalba territory and not the whole of the Shumaliyah. 5. Petroleum Concessions Limited would do well to confirm their friendly relations with Shaikh Khalid. 3d. K. yeightman. Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

We have 'been giving further consideration to the question of what action, if any, we should take vis-a-vis the Sheikhs, and what advice we should give to Petroleum Concessions Limited, v/ith a view to ending the present state of deadlock in the matter of oil concessions if no change in the situation has occurred Ly the end of the six month’s suspension of negotiations. 3. We feel satisfied that, on their side&gt; the Company are genuinely anxious to reach agreement, and only recently Longrigg has told us that if cash were the only obstacle in the way, the Company would he prepared, within limits, (and provided that in other respects the terms of the agreement were satisfactory from their point of view), to go even further than their present offers in hghtman, nsq*, r«C«o», -The Postmaster, order/ Karachi. / v I f / 5 f , J* - » -ifr: &gt; 2 . Tr order to clinch matters. But there would appear to he little doubt that the financial aspect is not the only stumbling block and that v/e must look elsewhere to find the reasons which have hitherto prevented the parties from coming to terms. For present purposes we need not consider Umm al Quwain, Ajman or Kalba since there is no reason to suppose that if the other Trucial Sheikhs agree to grant concessions these smaller States will not follow suit. 4. The real difficulty is in regard to Has al Khaimah and Abu Dhabi. As regards the former? it would appear probable that the Political Agreement has a good deal\ to do with the difficulty, even though, as stated by Fowle, it may not by itself actually have prevented the grant of a concession. At any rate the Company are quite convinced that but for our requirements in this respect the bheikh would have put his signature to the Concession Agreement last March, and they have therefore put forward very strongly their view that in the absence of some form oi pressure on the Sheikh from His Majesty’s Government (and this seems hardly practicable) their only hope of clinching matters within a reasonable time is that they should be given unfettered freedom to negotiate and conclude an agreement with the Sheikh, leaving questionsconcerning the Political Agreement aside until the z ^ concession has 'been signed. Pov/le has suggested that in all the circumstances the hest.course to pursue would he to retain the Political Agreement as between ourselves and the Company hut not to require its cognisance hy the Sheikhs, and I imagine therefore that you would see no objection to the course suggested hy the Company; hut before we consult the other interested departments in the matter there are two points on which we should be glad to have your views. 5. Firstly, we feel, and have so informed Longrigg, that if we agree to leave the Political Agreement question aside for further consideration, it would he necessary for the commercial agreement to he endorsed, at the time of signature, hy hoth parties, to the effect that it was subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. Longrigg, however, dislikes this as he thinks that it might frighten the Sheikhs and he has suggested that if we attach importance to the point the hest course would he for the Political Authorities to write at once to each Sheikh reminding them that in accordance with their written undertakings any oil concessions which they may grant hereafter will he subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. We feel here, however, that/that any such communication might do more harm than good and that it would he preferable to have the Concession Agreement endorsed in the manner suggested. Would you please let me know what you think? 6. The second point is this. Can you say what are likely to he the reactions of the Sheikhs of Sharjah and Debai if, in due course, we decide in the case of the other Trucial Sheikhs either (a) to modify or simplify the Political Agreements and complementary exchange of notes, or (h) to dispense altogether v/ith the Sheikhs* co-operation in the Political Agreement; e.g* would they (and the other Sheikhs) regard it as a climb-down on the part of His Majesty*s Government and if so how far would this result in a lessening of our prestige in that part of the world? 7. I now turn to Abu Dhabi. Here the position is different from that at Ras al Khaimah in th. t although the Sheikh has been offered more generous terms than those actually accepted by his neighbours (and the offer is not necessarily the last word), he persistently refuses to discuss business v/ith Petroleum Concessions Limited '*except on the same terns as Ibn Saud”. To this the Company are unable to agree and so far the question/(0 IXh CLuestion of the Political Agreement 'between His Majesty’s Government and the Company has not arisen although the Sheikh is no doubt fully aware of our requirements in tais respect, prima fac ie the deadlock at Abu Dhabi appears to be more serious than elsewhere and we should therefore be glad to know whether you think there is any real likelihood of a change of heart on the part of the Sheikh should the Company attempt to re-open negotiations with him during the coming winter, and, if not, whether there is anything that we can do to induce him to see reason. Would it do any good, for instance, to send him a further note reminding him of the ’’P.C.L. or no one” ultimatum with a hint that His Majesty’s Government really mean what they say? 6. We should be grateful for your views as soon as possible. 9. Copies of this letter are being sent to India and Bahrein (for the Agency file). )/ (9 CONfflDOTT IAL» Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, KARACHI.

( lliivs CX $ J»Z7 %JQJ 0 #ill you please refer to your demi-official letter Ho, P.Z.5634/38, dated the 25th August 1933, on the subject of Petroleum Concessions Limited and the Trucial Coast. that it is essential to include in any future Commercial Agreement an endorsement (or clause) that it is subject to the approval of His Majesty*s Government. If we are to dispense with the Shaikh*£ co-operation in the Political Agreement - and I fully agree with Sir Trenchard Fowle that we should do so - then this must be our minimum require ment; and it is from every point of view preferable to Longrigg*s suggestion of a warning letter to the Shaikhs. 3. as for your second point, I think I should say first that in my opinion a modification or simplification of the Political Agreement and of the complementary exchange of letters would have no practical value. If we are to facilitate the Company’s negotiations at all we must be prepared to dispense altogether with the Shaikhs* cognisance of and co-operation in the Political Agreement. There may perhaps be, as a result, some talk on the Coast of His Majesty’s Government climbing down, but there need be little fear of my serious loss of prestige provided we take the bull by the horns and inform the Coast of this decision through the Shaikhs of Debai and Sharjah. In other words 2 In regard to your first question I entirely agree I / R. T. Peel Require, M.C., The India Office, London.■i f - 2 - I suggest that both these Shaikhs should be informed that His Majesty's Gorernment hare now come to the conclusion that from their point of riew it is unnecessary to inrite their (the Shaikhs') oo-operation in any Agreement which may haTe been,or may be in the future, refcned between u. s Majesty's Government and the Company; and that consequently, while appreciating their (Debai's and Sharjah's) co-operative attitude towards this question. His Majesty's Government now propose to regard the entire correspondence with them relating to the subject of the Political Agreement as void arid or ! ‘° practical effect. 4. I anticipate that a communication in such terms would excite so much speculation - and uncertainty - in regard to His Majesty’s (JoYermaent* s motives that our loss of prestige would be negligible. And* alter arl, it is scarcely useful or reasonable to have some Slhaiichs adhering, while others do not adhere* to the Political Agreement. Vi* 5. wy only doubt is in regard to the question of Banks (of. paragraph 7 of Sir Trenchard Fowls* s demi-official letter No. c/427 of the 6th July 1938)* My own opinion has been that we ought to h&amp;Yd the final say in the selection of any Bank which may operate on the Trucial Coast* but you will see that Sir Ttenchard Fowls holds a different view. 6. To turn now to Abu Dhabi. It is extremely difficult to forecast what the Shaikh’s attitude will be during the coming winter. In May last I gave my opinion that it would take at least nine months and possibly as much as two years•rnrnmmm/gggf yeare for his OTtrwcenxng self-conceit to yield to the pressure of local influence (an euphemism for the anxiety of his relatives and advisers to get th*r hands on soae of Petroleum Concessions Limited’s money with the least possible delay). It is clear that the greater anxiety Petroleum Concessions Limited exhibit e.g. by over-import unity or by hints of increased offers the less effect can these local influences have. Squally we ourselves must do nothing which may encourage the Shaifch to believe that we have our anxieties, and it follows that if we are to send him reminders of the '•petroleum Concessions Limited or no one” ultimatum, or hints that His Majesty’s Government really mean it, they must be hung on to seme action of his own - for example a renewed approach to California Standard. And indeed one cannot hint to a Trucial Shaikh that His Majesty’s Government mean what they say I in making such a communication one must use the most explicit language. It is true that the information given by Ballantyne in his interview with Gibson on the 9tty June 1938 (of. the enclosure to Gibson's letter Ho. P.Z.3881/38 of the 3rd June 1938 to Seal) provides an excellent excuse for such a warning; but I see two objections to using it, (a) it is now a little too late and (0/ it anight prejudice the possibility of Abu Dhabi aid^to the exploration party at Baraimi (cf. my demi-official letter Mo.C/600, dated the 3rd September 1938). nevertheless other opportunities may occur later and, subject to the requirements of the moment, a reminder or warning could then be sent. 7. Recently Slut kh Ahmad bin Khalaf bin ’Utaibah, one of the most influential men in Abu Dhabi, informed the Residency Agent-4- Agent at Sharjah that he could negotiate the Abu Dhabi Oil Concession within ten days - though he omitted to add on what conceivable that his boast indiacates some change of heart in the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and Petroleum Concessions Limited*s representative may find his task easier this winter, nevertheless I would advise against any prolonged stay by the latter in Abu Dhabi unless the omens are distinctly favourable, I am convinced that by far the best possible course lies in an attitude of unconcern towards the Shaikh while the local influences to which I have referred above (carefully encouraged in their expectations) continue to increase their pressure, 8, There are of course other oomplioations so far as Abu Dhabi is concerned. Much may depend on the decisions reached regarding Khor el Odeid and the action to be taken to dis courage slave trade, Ae f however, decisions on both these questions may be delayed indefinitely it will serve no object at the present juncture to discuss their possible effects. terms.

Arabian Peninsula. (Prepared in the Petroleum Department, June 1938.)— (Received in Foreign Office, June 11.) FOR the purposes of this summary the Arabian Peninsula may be said to lie south of a line joining Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea to Koweit at the northern end of the Persian Gulf. Included in this area are the following States, sheikhdoms or territories, in most of which petroleum concessions have been, or are likely to be, obtained :— (A) Under British sovereignty or protection— Koweit. Bahrein. Qatar. Trucial Sheikhdoms— Ajman. Abu Dhabi. Debai. Ras-al-Khaimah. Sharjah. Umm-al-Quwaim. Aden Colony. Aden Protectorate. (B) Independent States— Saudi Arabia— (i) Red Sea Area. (ii) Nejd— The Yemen. Muscat and Oman.^) (C) Miscellaneous— Koweit Neutral Zone. Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 2. As Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are interested in the majority of the above-mentioned territories it has been thought worth while to include in this summary a short note on the genesis and composition of the company. 3. The company, which was first registered in October 1935, is a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the change of name was decided upon in order to facilitate the securing of concessions outside Iraq. The whole of the shares in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are held by the same interests and in the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the boards of the two companies are similarly composed, except that the Board of Petroleum ( l ) His Majesty’s Government exercise by custom only a considerable degree of influence over the affairs of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.

(b) Remainder of Nejd. 9918 [330 1—1] B2 Concessions (Limited) does not include an Iraqi Government Director. Lord Cadman is chairman of both companies. The shareholding of the Iraq Petroleum Company is divided as follows :—’■ Percentage. British— y Anglo-Iranian Oil Company 23-75 Dutch— Royal Dutch Shell ... ... ... ... ... 23-75 French— Compagnie Fran§aise des Petroles ... ... 23-75 American— Near East Development Company (i.e., Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum in the proportion of 50-50) ... ... ... 23-75 Participation and Investments (Limited)— C. S. Gulbenkian ... ... ... ... ... 5-00 100-00 Koweit. 4. The concession for this territory is held by the Koweit Oil Company (Commercial Agreement, dated the 23rd December, 1934; Political Agreement,( 2 ) dated the 5th March, 1934), the capital of which is held jointly by the x\nglo- Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of America (Mellon Group). 5. One well was put down on the north side of Koweit Bay, but only small quantities of oil were found. Another well has been drilled at Burgan, south of Koweit Bay, and was successful in striking oil. Koweit Neutral Zone. 6. The boundaries between Koweit and Nejd were settled at the Uquair Conference of November 1922, when certain territory was recognised as common to these two States. Under this settlement the Rulers of Koweit and Nejd were to enjoy equal rights in the zone until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived M between them. Consequently, neither Ruler can grant an oil concession in the zone without the consent of the other. 7. Matters in regard to oil negotiations in the Neutral Zone have, in consequence, reached a deadlock. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) cannot move because the Sheikh of Koweit, to whom application has been made, refuses to grant an option in respect of his share of the oil rights in the zone, since he considers that he is entitled to all the rights in the zone and hopes to obtain them when Ibn Saud dies. Petroleum Concessions (Limited), however, have been informed by the Sheikh of Koweit that he will, if he changes his mind, inform them before any other company. On the other hand, Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, who is now thought to favour exploitation of the zone by a British company, is committed to the Standard Oil Company of California by reason of a special agreement with that company, under which they received a preferential position in respect of Ibn Saud’s rights in the zone much the same as that which they received in regard to the unallotted areas in Nejd (see paragraphs 2L-28 below). Bahrein. 8. Oil development in Bahrein is being undertaken by the Bahrein Petroleum Company (Limited) under a lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein on the 29th December, 1934, and modified on the 3rd June, 1936. The lease covers practically the whole of the Island of Bahrein, and runs for a period of fifty-five years from the 1st January, 1935. Up to the end of 1937 58 wells had been drilled or were about to be drilled, 33 were producing, and 14 were shut-in. Production during 1937 amounted to approximately 1,108,894 tons. ( 2 ) By “Political Agreement” is meant in this memorandum an agreement between the concessionary company and His Majesty’s Government, to which the Euler concerned is usually an assenting party, by which the company undertakes not to transfer the concession to non-British interests and to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government generally.fmmmmmam 3 9. Negotiations in respect of the area belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but not allotted to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in their lease, have been carried on between the sheikh on the one hand and both Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, on the other, but so far without definite result. 10 The Bahrein Petroleum Company was incorporated in Canada in 1929, the whole of the share capital being subscribed by the Standard Oil Company of California. In 1936 an agreement was reached between the Standard Oil Company and the Texas Corporation, whereby the latter company obtained a half interest in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As the Texas Oil Corporation has markets in various Eastern countries, this arrangement secures an outlet for the refined products obtained from the refinery recently erected in Bahrein. Qatar. 11. The oil rights in this territory were originally granted to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the 17th May, 1935. A political agreement was entered into on the 5th June, 1935. The agreement, which runs for a term of seventy-five years, was transferred to Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) (the operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in Qatar) on the 5th February. 1937. Geological survey work has been carried out and arrangements have been made to commence deep drilling operations in the autumn of 1938. 12. Considerable difficulty has arisen between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government with regard to the boundaries between Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud claims a frontier which in effect overlaps the limits of the concession held by Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) and indicated in the map attached to the concession. His Majesty’s Government do not admit Ibn Saud’s claim, but have offered him a frontier which, while lying to the south of the Qatar concession boundary, is nevertheless beyond what they regard as the legal limit laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. The Tracial Sheikhdoms. 13. The position in the Trucial States is as follows :— 14 A jman .—Petroleum Concessions (Limited) held an option giving them the exclusive right to explore for oil in this territory for a period of two years. The option period expired on the 22nd January, 1938. but the company have so far failed to induce the sheikh to grant an oil concession. 15. Ahu Dhabi .—The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 3rd January, 1938. Negotiations for a concession were recently suspended as the sheikh is proving difficult. 16. Debai .—Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this territory for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 22nd May, 1937, and Political Agreement dated the 5th February, 1937). No work has so far been carried out. 17. Ras-al-Khaimah .—The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 1st August, 1937. A political agreement, preceding the conclusion of a commercial agreement, was signed on the 25th March, 1938. Negotiations for the latter are in suspense. 18. Sharjah .—Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this area for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 17th September, 1937; Political Agreement signed the 12th November, 1937). 19. Umm-al-Quwaim .—No option or concession has yet been obtained in respect of this territory, but the sheikh recently informed Petroleum Concessions (Limited) that he was “ willing to negotiate.” Aden Protectorate. 20. An application for an oil exploration licence in respect of this territory has been made by Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and also jointly by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have priority, and the Protectorate authorities have been recommended to grant that company an exclusive exploration permit for a term of two years, after which the other companies could be given an exclusive permit in respect of the territory not retained by Petroleum Concessions (Limited). A draft of the exploration permit has been agreed between the Colonial Office and the [330 1—1] b 24 company, and sent to the Governor for consideration. In the meantime, Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have been given permission to send an exploration party to the Protectorate (see also note under “ Muscat and Oman ). Saudi Arabia: (i) Red Sea Area. 21. The petroleum rights in this area were granted to Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 9th July, 1936. The concession runs for a period of sixty years and covers the whole of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia to a depth of 100 kilom. (together with the Farsan and other islands and territorial waters). Prospecting work has been carried out by Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) —the local operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited)—but with the exception of the Farsan Islands and a very small stretch of the coast the results have been disappointing. Saudi Arabia: (ii) Nejd. 22. (a) Flasa. —The oil rights in this area were conceded to the Standard Oil Company of California by Ibn Saud on the 27th May, 1933. The con cession has since been transferred to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, a subsidiary company, the share capital of which is wholly owned by Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation equally. The concession runs for a period of sixty years. The area of the concession as set out in the relevant article of the concession agreement is as follows :— “All of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters), westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north, 30 degrees west, to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south, 30 degrees east, to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia.” 23. Drilling has been carried out by the company and some oil has been found. It has recently been reported that a well giving 3,400 barrels of oil per day has been brought in. Some of the oil from Hasa is being taken to Bahrein for refining. It is also understood that plans for the development of a port on the Hasa coast are under consideration and that the necessary chart will shortly be prepared by the Admiralty on the basis of information supplied bv the company as the result of a survey carried out by them. 24. (b) Remainder of iV^'d.—The position as regards oil exploration rights in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea area or Hasa area concessions, referred to above, is uncertain. It was believed at the time that the Hasa concession agreement had been supplemented by a special agreement or “ secret clause,” giving the Standard Oil Company of California some kind of an option on this territory, but details were lacking. 25. Information has recently been received, however, which points to the probability that on the 29th May, 1933, the Saudi Arabian Government and the company agreed upon a modified form of the concession signed on the 27th May (referred to in paragraph 22), the modifications consisting of the addi- 1 tion of two extra articles, numbered respectively 3 and 7, which have been inserted in their appropriate positions in the body of the original agreement of the 27th May, the subsequent articles being appropriately renumbered, and a revised version of the (renumbered) article 35. 26. The effect inter alia of these additional articles (or special agreement) is to accord to the Standard Oil Company of California— “a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area (f.#., the Hasa concession area) as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations.” His Majesty’s Government are not at present aware whether or where this “ contact line ” has been established. There is presumably an area uncovered by any concession or preference rights between the “ contact line,’' wherever that may be, and the eastern boundary of the Red Sea concession.5 27. A further provision is that the Standard Oil Company of California shall have the right to recover “by means of deductions from one-half of the royalties due to the Government ” the amount of two loans totalling £50,000 gold received by the Saudi Arabian Government from the company. f 28. 6n the same date as the conclusion of this modified agreement letters were exchanged by the company and the Saudi Arabian Government defining the company’s preference rights in regard to {a) “ the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia ” referred to in paragraph 26 above, and (5) the Koweit Neutral Zone (see paragraph 7 above). The effect of these preference rights in (a) is to entitle the company to acquire an oil concession on terms equal to those which may be offered to the Saudi Arabian Government by another company. If the Standard Oil Company of California elect not to exercise their right, the Saudi Arabian Government is free to accept the other company’s offer. Otherwise, the Standard Oil Company of California’s preference right shall continue at least so long as the provisions of the special agreement remain in force. The Yemen. 29. No concession has so far been obtained in this territory owing to the attitude of the Imam Yahya, who opposes the exploitation of his country by foreign interests. The French interests in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have, how ever, been successful in inducing the Imam to permit two geologists to visit the Yemen for a period of six months. Muscat and Oman. 30. Two concessions^) have been obtained from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman by Petroleum Concessions (Limited), one in respect of Muscat and Oman except the district of Dhofar and the other in respect of Dhofar. Both commer cial agreements are dated the 24th June, 1937, and run for a period of seventy- five years. The Sultan at first showed himself averse from being associated in any way with any political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the company. This question was, however, discussed with the Sultan during his visit to this country in April of this year, and the Sultan in the end agreed to be associated with such an agreement in a modified form. 31. An aerial exploration which it is hoped to carry out in the eastern portion of the Aden Protectorate will probably include the western portion of Muscat and Oman. Refinery Agreement with Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 32. A general Refinery Agreement was entered into between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 5th February, 1937. Briefly, the agreement provides that whenever the production of crude oil in the areas over which the company hold, or may hold, oil concessions in the Persian Gulf area reaches a total of 500,000 tons per annum, the company shall erect, on a site to be agreed, a refinery or refineries with a total capacity of not less than 250,000 tons per annum, unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government that this would be precluded by commercial considerations.

Rre-emption of Oil in the Event of an Emergency. 33. The political agreements entered into between His Majesty’s Govern ment and Petroleum Concessions (Limited), in respect of the concessions secured by the company in Qatar, Debai, Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah, provide, inter alia, that in the event of a state of national emergency or war (of the existence of which His Majesty’s Government shall be the sole judge) His Majesty’s Govern ment shall have the sole right of pre-emption of all crude oil obtained under the concessions and of all the products thereof. His Majesty’s Government have also the right to require the company to the extent of any refining capacity it may have (®) A separate concession may be granted by the Sultan later for his Asiatic territory, G., Gwadur.V in each State (but see the preceding paragraph defining the refinery position) to produce oil fuel that shall comply with the Admiralty specifications at the time, provided that the oil is of a suitable kind and quality for this purpose, and to take control of the company’s works, plant and premises Similar provisions appear in the political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the^ Koweit Oil Company. In the c&amp;se of Muscat and Oman pre-emption will not be provided for in the modified form of political agreement with which the Sultan will be associated (see note under Muscat and Oman above) but in a separate agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 34. No political agreement was entered into between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Bahrein Petroleum Company in respect of the concession in Bahrein (nor is pre-emption provided for in the lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein), but in view of the - sheikh’s special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government it is not anticipated that any difficulty would occur in securing the pre-emption of Bahrein oil in the event of an emergency. f r \ Petroleum Department&lt; June 10, 1938.

December 8th,1938 Petroleum Concessions Limited, London. An Exploration Permit, for years extendable to and containing the prospect of a future Concession (if the Company should so desire) based on the &gt;f consent of both parties' 1 was signed here last night. .2 - The Arabic original and an English translation are attached hereto. The Shaikh retains one Arabic original. Copies In both languages are being passed to the Political Agent, Bahrain. . 1 It was explained in my letter of Dec. 7th that the Shaikh was not prepared to sign a Concession at the present time, even if the Company offered very much more than at pre vious discussions. It did not appear that any persuasions by the Company* s representatives could alter this decision, unless )&gt;erhaps by the offer of payment on a scale not pre viously contemplated. The choice there seemed to lie between leaving our position in this territory still quite indeterminate and offering the Baler an Option, or Exploration Permit, type of Agreement. After some conversations with him and his advisers, a draft exploration permit was submitted to the Shaikh, con taining (1) no initial payment, (2) moderate monthly payments, (3) fbll drilling rights, (4) promise of a concession later 'on terms similar to those granted by other rulers of Oman 19 , on demand by the Company in the event of oil being discovered, (5) considerably greater initial payments than had been con templated before, in that event only. The Shaikh, however, taaktsaxt declined to allow any drilling until after a con cession had been signed, and did not wish to b ind himself at present as to subsequent concession terms. He and his adviserstherefore suggested a simpler fora of permit, and this was finally agreed* Permit signed and herewith forwarded contains, as will be seen, the following principal matters:- (1) Exclusive rights of search and exploration (but not drilling) for years, extendable for a further one yearl 12) A subsequent agreement is to be made (prior to drilling) covering drilling, exploitation, etc* at any time the Companv may apply for it after exploration work* This shall be made 'with the consent of both parties'. (3) The Company may surrender the present permit at any _ time after the first year - i*e. it is not committed to any payment except the first. (4) The annual payment for the first years is at the rate of Rs. 30,000 (£2250) per year, and for the extension year at the rate of Rs* 45000 (£3300) per y*«r. There is an additional payment of Rs. 10000 (£750) on original signature and I promised a present of one Ford van. (5) The Company may not enter 'dangerous areas'. (It will —_ probably be found in practice that these areas if any will be areas improperly ndfcx claimed by the Shaikhjf as his: and, since they are not named, they could probably be entered, if required, under other than his auspices — with the pie* that we never considered them to belong to him nor to be covered by the Agreement). Such are the chief provisions* ^ As against a concession on the lines hitherto discussed, it represents an immediate saving of some Rs. 150,000 (initial payment) while postponing e Concession settlement, if the Com pany (after 4 field-seasons further work) still wishes to proceed to this. It is probable that the time will come within the next 3£ years when the Shaikh will be better dis posed to a Concession than he is at present, and the Company can take advantage of any such opportunity without having lost anything* On the other hand it may well appear during the period that, so weak is the inland hold of the coastal rulers, the Company would after ell be better advised to do its business with the ihhnd tribal chiefs (whose first step will doubtless be to repudiate all Ras al control) direct. Sd/- Stephen H* LongriggThis Agreement was concluded at Has al Khaimah on the 14th day of the month of Shawwal, 1367 A*H., corresponding to the 7th day of the month of December* 1938 A.D., between His S&amp;ccellency Shaikh Sultan bin Salim* Ruler of Has al Khaimah and its dependencies (hereinafter called 'the Ruler' ) f of the one part, and Mr. Stephen Hemsley Longrigg* General Manager of Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. (a British company registered in London), hereinafter called 'the Company', of the other part; and agreement has been reached as follows:--* (1) The expression 'the Ruler' includes both the present Ruler and any Ruler to whom may in the future belong the administration of Has al Khalnah and its dependencies. (2) The Ruler grants to the Company an exclusive right for the search for mineral oils and similar substances within the territories subject to his rule and under his administration as Ruler of Has al Khaimah and its dependen cies. The Company may employ all the means of search and exploration, except boring and drilling. If the Company, after its exploration, wishes to employ any boring or drilling, this shall be governed by a special agreement between the Ruler and the Company. The Ruler undertakes to assist the Company and protect its employees and pro perty to the full extent of his ability; but the Company shall have no right to claim against the Ruler for any damage in respect of any failure to comply with this obli gation. It is to be understood from this that there exist certain districts in the Territory (which would be) dan gerous for the Company, and the Company has no right of entry into these districts except after written notice from the Ruler to the Company that they are no longer dan gerous, and this (shall be the case) even if it involved failure to enter them up to the end of the period of this Agreement.• 2 . (3) Whenever the Company, after its explorations, shall be persuaded of the existence of oil within the territory, an Agreement shall in such case be concluded between the Ruler and the Company with the consent and free choice of both, to cover all that concerns the rights and obligations (which shall exist) between the Ruler and the Company. (4) This Agreement shall remain effective from the date of signature until the end of its period* (5) The Company shall pay to the Ruler within twenty days from the signature of the Agreement forty thousand rupees (Rs. 40000) in respect of the first year, and after the end of that year shall pay seven thousand five hundred rupees (Rs# 7500) every three months in advance# (6) The Company shall have the right to surrender the whole of its rights and obligations arising out of this Agree ment at any time after the pass age of one whole year follow ing signature, after giving three months written notice# (7) The period provided for exploration under this Agree ment. is two years and a half, and at the end of that period if the studies and e xplorations of the Company are not com pleted, and it requires an additional period to complete them, then the Company shall have the right to a prolongation of the period fen* one further year, with an increase of fifty per cent in the rent payable. (8) (a) The Company undertakes that its personnel shall not interfere in the government of the country or in any thing which may injure the local administration. Ib) The Company shall pay the salaries of the guards who shall protect the exploration personnel, and the nusiber of such guards shall be fixed by agreement between the two parties according to the conditions and circumstances# (Signature) General Manager of Petroleum (Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd Stephen H.

As you are aware, normally an oil ccncession is divided into three stages - Exploration, Prospecting and finally Mining. This was, for instance, the original form in which the Bahrain Concession was given t* ~ahrain Petroleum Company - vide Colonial Office letter No.79/^5/30 of the 8th February 1930 to the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, in later concessions, however, on the Arab side all three stages have been telescoped into one concession. 4. The present Exploration Permit of Petroleum Concessiais Limited a t Ras a l Khaimah is in effect the first of the above 2. On the balance of advantages it seems to me a good move •T.Peel Lond on.2 — stages and from another aspect is really a continuation of the /pi St • P.C.L. Has al Khaimah Option which expired on the 1st August 1937* An important difference, however, is that the further activities of the Company after the Permit expires are subject to the ♦’consent of both parties'* (see paragraph 5 (2) of Long- rigg^ letter of December 8th. Longrigg has not numbered his paragraphs,•business men' never do, but I have done it for him.) In the normal concession the concessionaire has an option to proceed to the second stage and then to the third provided he exercises this option within the period which is laid down. 5. With regard to Longrigg’s opinion on the subject of the decision to allow Petroleum Concessions Limited to negotiate direct with the Beni Kitab for a visit to Jebel Faiyah, commented on in paragraph 2 of Weightman’s letter under reference. It is possible that Longrigg may be correct but in order to give the Company any pooaible chance of getting to Jebel Paly ah this decision had to be made - see correspondence ending with India Office telegram No*1826 of 18th October 1938.

Dear Starling, Would you kindly refer to weightmim*s demi- official letter No. 0/602 of the 3i'd September (a copy of which was sent to the Petroleum Department with India Office printed letter No. P.Z.6290/38 of the 13 th September) and connected correspondence on the subject of oil concessions on the Trucial Coast ? the outset that we are to maintain the embargo on other competitors and do what we can to assist Petroleum Concessions Limited to obtain the outstanding concessions. Ls to what we can do to help the Company we may, it is suggested, advise them to try again this hutumn (but without outstaying their 'welcome). This the Company are prepared to do (and it is probable that Longrigg himself will, .undertake the task), but as you will have seen from the connected correspondence the Company are anxious that we should net require the remaining Sheikhs to co-operate, as Sharjah and Dcbai have done, in respect of the political agreement. Spring. e have no reason to suppose that this is not ahe of opinion that we should fall in 'with the Company’s views. In considering this matter we have assumed at They think that, but for this requirement, they would have obtained a concession from Ras-al-Khaimah 1 case, and as you will see Weightman and Fowle are definitely If this is done we should, of course, still insist on political/ Starling, Esq. , Petroleum Department (Mines Department), Dean Stanley Street, S.W.1.2. Political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company (including the important pre-emption clauses) and if it is thought desirable we could (as was suggested in your «««• * letter No. P. D. 859/4 Part I of the 25th .npril last on the subject of the Muscat Oil Agreement) require the Company to include a clause in the commercial agreement to the effect that the concession shall only be transferable to a British Company registered in Great Britain and having its principal place of business in this country. It would? however? in any case, be provided in the Political agreement that the concession cannot be transferred without the prior consent of —■ \ . f v- His Majesty’s Government? etc. (article 2 of the Political agreement). It is true that an explicit sanction is obtained for the Political agreement by the provision in exchanges of letters with the Sheikh and the Company whereby Mie former’s right is recognised to terminate the concession if the latter fail to observe the terms of the Political agreement. But we feel that this additional safeguard is hardly required because the Company would in any case be so dependent on the goodwill of His Majesty’s Government and so amenable to pressure in various forms that they would be extremely unlikely to fail to observe the terms of the .^greemenc. „e accordingly feel that in all the circumstances any risk of such failure is one that can be safely taken and that it is outweighed by the difficulties of getting the Sheikhs to grant concessions if they are required to underwrite (as it were) the Political agreements and we trust that you w iH ^ &gt;e able to agree with us on this point. If the principle is accepted that the Sheikhs may be left out of the Political agreement certain details will have to be settled. Firstly? there is Meightman’s suggestion that the Rulers/Rulers of Sharjah and Debai should be released forthwith 'li( from thc^'r obligations in respect of the Political Agreement. Fowle’s view with which we strongly agree, on this point, is that we need not at this stage release Sharjah and Debai from their obligations and that matters should be left as they are unless and until the Sheikhs themselves raise the question. ^ , Secondly, there is the point (discussed in paragraph 5 of Peel’s demi-official letter to heightman No. P.2.5634/33 of 25th August, and paragraph 2 of leightman’s reply of the 3rd September) regarding the necessity of having the concession agreement accompanied by an endorsement or clause, which would be binding on both parties, to the effect that it is subject to His Majesty’s Government’s approval. Longrigg has again expressed his objections to this as he feels strongly that any further insistence on the rights of His Majesty’s Government will almost certainly hamper his negotiations particularly in the case of Ras-al-Khaimah. Y.’hen putting this point to weight man it was assumed that a decision in regard to the Sheikhs co-operation in respect of the Political Agreement would not be taken until the concession agreement had been signed; but if we are to take this decision now it seems to us (and Fowle agrees) that the need for re-emphasising the position of His Majesty’s Government no longer arises. The Company fully understands that, in accordance with the general oil undertaking signed by the Sheikhs our approval of the concession is required, and there is no reason to anticipate that they will be difficult in the matter of the Political agreement, which moreover could be ready for signature perhaps simultaneously with, or at any rate soon after, the concession agreement. In/4. In any case the point can he put in writing to the Company before negotiations are re-opened. we should he glad to learn whether you agree.

Dear G-ibson, tfill you please refer to your letter P.Z.6290/38 of the 3rd October, and previous correspondence, about oil concessions on the Trucial Coast. The admiralty’s views on the various points raised may be summarised as follows j- (1) The ultimatum of 1937 * ^e agree that His Majesty’s Government should not be led by the opposition of the outstanding Sheikhs to withdraw from the ultimatum restricting the Trucial Coast to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. (2) I mprovement in financial off ers. that an improved financial offer at the present juncture by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. will have undesirable reactions on the Sheikhs who have already concluded agreements with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. on the terms originally offered. They may well consider His Majesty’s Government to be responsible for the financial loss which they will consider themselves to have suffered as a result of accepting, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, concessions at less favourable rates. Further, improvement of terms as a price for resistance may have a bad effect on our subsequent dealings with the Sheikhs generally. terms must remain primarily a question between the Company and the Sheikh, and therefore, if the Company are prepared themselves, without pressure from the Government, to improve their offer, we would be prepared to acquiesce. There appears to us to be considerable danger Nevertheless, it appears to us that the financial2. \7e would, however, desire that, so far as possible, improvement should be in respect of payments between which direct comparison is difficult, rather than in the rate of royalty, and that there should be as little obvious differentiation between the Sheikhs as possible. (3) Sheikhs co-operation i n lolitical agreemen t. The admiralty has felt considerable doubt as to the advisability or necessity £f relaxing, for the Sheikhs of ^*bu Dhabi and Has al Khaimah, and the lesser recalcitrant Sheikhs, the formalities insisted on for instance at Debai. The reasons for our doubts may be summarised as follows (a) It is true that the need for co-operation in the Political agreement did apparently deter Ras al Khaimah from signing. This consideration has not, so far as we can see, arisen at ^bu Dhabi, and there is no indication that Abu Dhabi would fall into line if this accepted procedure were dropped. Ras al Khaimah, himself, having stood out so long, may be unwilling to sign on the original terms even if we relax this condition for him. ke may well, therefore, be no better off, but have suffered some loss of prestige, if we give way on the Political agreement at this juncture. (b) *ilso only after considerable discussion did we «— give way, and then only partially, to the Sultan of Muscat, over the same question. It will not help our relations with him, if, after so much difficulty with him, we now give way, more easily, and more completely, to the lesser Sheikhs. (c) The Sheikhs' sanction does appear, in spite of ^— arguments adduced to the contrary, to be a valuable asset in certain contingencies. The safeguards in the agreements about which the -admiralty is particularly concerned are:- (i) the provision stipulating that the concessionnaire shall remain British. (ii) the x^re-emption clause attaching to the Political Agreement. (iii) the Refinery Agreements with the Companies. Provided the Company does in fact remain British, it should be 7 possible to take action in ihia country to enforce the pre-emption and refinery agreement./3. agreements. Oil Companies are ? however, essentially international; Petroleum Concessions Ltd. itself is only partly British, and the validity of the agreement hetween His Majesty’s Government and the Company that it shall not change its nationality, seems doubtful* Further, it'is always possible, by means of holding Companies, etc., or simply by purchase of shares, for transfer of effective control to be made to some second country without change in the nominal character of the Company. There may well be circumstances in the future in which, apart from some clear external sanction, we -would have difficulty in enforcing our agreement with the original concessionnaire Company. The Sheikhs’ sanction does provide a clear right to His Majesty’s Government to enforce its original agreement, whereas without it it might prove, at the least, legally and politically difficult to take strong action against the ultimate controllers of the original Company. ii.nd, apart from such considerations, there may always be found loopholes or legal difficulties in the political agreements which might make action even against a British controlled company difficult, apart from a clearly defined final sanction. The existence of such a sanction, however, would in itself make the Companies less inclined to prove difficult or attempt evasion. In view, however, of the agreement of your advisers in the Gulf in favour of dispensing with the Sheikhs co opera cion, we would, if the India.Office and other interested Departments are satisfied that this is the test course, not stand in the way of a new attempt, on this basis, with Ras al Khaimah, and, if necessary, ,Vbu Dhabi. \!q are not, however, in favour of releasing Debai and Sharjah from their existing obligations.

The Foreign Office (Baggallay's letter of the 12th October, h 5699/19/91) have concurred in our proposals, and the Admiralty (Jones's letter of the 20th October, M.04284/38), while emphasising the force of the arguments for retaining the co-operation of the Sheikhs in the Political Agreement, do not dissent from our suggestions if these represent the general view. xfe have now sent you (India Office letter of the 9th December, F. 2.8032/38) a copy of a further letter from the Political Resident, dared the 25th November, expressing views consonant with the suggestions made in our letter of' the 3rd October and asking for as early a decision as possible. y e should be grateful therefore i x we could be informed urgently whether you agree uith our proposals, namely that in order to'D^si Petroleum Concessions Limited in the special circumstances of the case he remaining Sheikhs should not be required to take cognisance of the Political Agreement, and further that the tor ling, Esq. , -oleum Depart me nt. concessions/concessions need not be accompanied by an endorsement or clause to the effect that the concession is subject to His /&lt;) Majesty’s Government’s approval; that the Sheikhs of Debai and Sharjah should not be released from their existing obligations, at any rate at this stage; and that one Company should still be required to conclude a Political Agreement v/i th Hi s Ma jes ty ’ s Government. If you agree, would you kindly also say whether you thiiu: it essential that the provision in the Political Agreement (Article 2) preventing transfer of the Company’s concession without the prior consent of His Majesty's Government should be reinforced by requiring the Company to include in their concession agreement a clause to the effect that the concession shall only be transferable to a British Company registered in Great Britain and having its principal iJlace of business in this country.

I forward herewith a copy of a letter dated the 21st December 1938 received from Mr. Longrigg, intimating the conclusion of an agreement between his Company and the Regent of Kalba, together with its accompaniments. 3. Although no final decision by His Majesty 1 s Government in regard to the question of retaining or not retaining the co-operation of the Shaikhs in Political Agreements has yet been received (cf. * ! : correspondence resting with India Office Printed letter No. P.Z. 8032/38 dated the 13th December 1938), it appears from the corres pondence just quoted that this particular question will raise no impediment to the approval of the concession negotiated. On the other hand the wording of the preamble to the Lease, and the fact that it has apparently been signed by Shaikh Khalid as Ruler of Kalba appear to me to vitiate the whole agreement. I have already communicated demi-officially with the Local Manager of Petroleum Concessions Limited suggesting that in the preamble, after the words ,f Regent/- is / &lt;? /e J s. u. ^ UP JrjTcTtt )-2 ,f Regent of Kalba M , the words 'acting on behalf of Shaikh Hamad bia 3aidj Shaikh of Kalba' should be inserted^ and taat at the end Shaikh Khalid*s designation should be Regent on behalf of the Ruler of Kalba and its dependence s Though it may well be that the object of this agreement is more to cement the personal friendship of Shaikh Khalid with the Company than to provide for a future oil field, never theless there must remain the possibility of oil being dis covered and the concession therefore should be in correct form. 4. It will be observed that, as Mr. Longrigg states, the wording of the concession has been considerably simpli fied in many places, in comparison with the standard form of concession hitherto used, and for easy reference I attach to this letter a schedule showing variations between the Dubai Concession and the present agreement. I need only draw attention here to three points:- (a) Article 4 scarcely seems to me to be appropriate in its present place and might more properly have been included in an exchange of covering letters. Nevertheless I see no reason for strong objection to it. (b) There is no article in the Kalba Agreement corres ponding to Article 21 in the Dubai Concession, in regard to transfer. The present concession has been signed on behalf of Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited instead of Petroleum Concessions Limited (which is pre sumably unobjectionable) and consequently no transfer provision is necessary. Indeed it is an advantage that the concession does not include provision for transfer to any other company. (c) There is no provision equivalent to Article 25 of the Dubai Concession in regard to a bank. It follows that not/-not only will His Majesty^ Government be unable to prevent the establishment of a wholely foreign bank but also the ©ompany itself will have no influence over the Shaikh in the selection of the bank. In this connection a reference ♦ 7 $ is invited to paragraph 7 of your demi-official letter No. C/427 dated the 6th July 1938 to the India Office. 6 . Subject to consideration of the points mentioned above, I recorafnend that the Company be informed that the concession, after amendment in respect of the designation of Shaikh Khalid, is approved by His Majesty^ Government, and that I should be authorised to make a similar communi cation to Shaikh Khalid on behalf of the Shaikh of Kalba. Political Agent, BahrainCopy of letter dated Dubai, 21st December 1938, from Mr* Stephen H* Longrigg to the Political Agent, Bahrain. I have pleasure in forwarding to you herewith a translated copy of an Agreement concluded yesterday between the Company and the Regent of Kalbah. I send also a copy of a letter addressed by me to my London principals, indicating certain points connected with the Agreement. In assessing both the territories and the degree of influence of Shaikh Khalid, I have had the advantage of the advice of the Residency Agent, Sharjah. As it was ascertained from the India Office some weeks ago that no objection would be felt to the Company obtaining these rights from the Shaikh of Kalbah, and as the form of the document follows closely that already approved by without any new features of which I can anticipate their disapproval, I hope that will X,-.. , ^v^ jm^rnsLy-.-i ^ be able shortly to signify that the present Concession may be considered as fully in force*-1 V COPY DUBAI TRUCIAL COAST December 20th, 1938, Petroleum Concessions Ltd. London. After a number of conversations between the under signed and Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed of Kalbah, all held at Ajman where the Shaikh is staying, an Agreement was signed today between him and the Company. &gt; This Agreement is forwarded to you herewith in the Arabic original, with an English translation. An Arabic original remains with the Shaikh, and translations are being sent to our Bahrain office and to the Political Agent, Bahrain. % The necessary funds for the payments specified are being mxmX obtained from the Eastern Bank, Karachi, by Air, as in the case of the recent Ras al Khaimah agreement. &lt;4 It will be observed that the new Agreement follows closely the lines of previous Concessions on the Trucial Coast. A quantity of unessential matter has been omitted, and the wording simplified in certain places. Efforts were made to ensure that the Shaikh understood what he was signing, but large parts did not appear to interest him. He was resolute only about obtaining f, the same as Sharjah and Dubai'. This, generally speaking, he has done. Article 4 is new, and emphasises that the Shaikh is a man of outstanding personality, and likely to be of real value to che '^omparry in its future efforts to obtain access to dif ficult areas. He is the oldest, and the most personally im -vuen uicil, of the Cuwasim rulers, although his own terri tory is small. It extends from the boundary between the Muscat territories at Murair and the Shumaliysh, to a point near Dibah at the north end of the Shumaliyah, omitting cer tain villages which have an independent status. He claims to be paramount over a good part of the mountain country behind/-behind that coast, and to be able to influence tribes well outside his own country. The village of Dhaid is his. The payments to be made on and after the discovery of commercial oil are the same as those provided in the Dubai and Sharjah Concessions. So also is the official payment on first signature; but the ^unofficial payments” (Rs 45000 in the case of Dubai and fis 55000 in that of Sharjah) are not to be made, there will be one motor car to be given instead of two, and it is hoped to keep the inevitable presents to the Shaikh 1 s relations within reasonable limits. The annual sum payable with effect from a year hence, is to be Rs 24000 instead of Rs 30000 at Dubai, and ife 40000 at Sharjah. Sd/- Stephen H. Longrigg.

P&gt;C. 32/140 19th DeceiifDer, 1938 Dear Ivjr. Gihson, I enclose, Lor the information of the India Office, a copy of an Agreement executed on the vth December,whereby the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah grants to P.D. (Trucial Coast) Ltd. exclusive exploration rights over his territories for a period of 2i years, v/ith right to a one year extension. A copy of this Agreement has been sent to the Political Agent, Bahrain. The Shaikh originally granted to the D’Arcy Exploration Company, who transferred it to P.C.L., a 2 year’s option which expired on the 1st August,1937. We have since been endeavouring to obtain from the Shaikh a concession on the lines of those obtained from Dubai and Sharjah, but the Shaikh has resolutely refused to sign such a concession at the present time, and it was considered preferable to get him to grant us an exploration permit rather than to leave the territory entirely uncovered. The uayments v/hich he is to get under this permit are considerably greater than the payment under the previous option, which amounted to only Rs.9,000 a year. Longrigg writes:- 'It is probable that the time will come within the next years when the Shaikh will be better disposed to a Concession than he is at present, and the Company can take advantage of any such opportunity without having lost anything. On the other hand it may well appear during the period/,f period that, so weak is the inland hold of the coastal rulers, the Company would after all he hotter advised to do its business with the inland tribal chiefs (whose first step will doubtless be to repudiate all Ras ai Khairnah control) direct.

(Designation)-2- ©&gt;**r as Officiating Political Resident that any agreement made with TOialid must toe solely in the latter*s capacity ae guardian of the minor Shaikh of Cal to a* The present agreement made toy Longrigg does not allow for this t and 1 think that, in order that the whole agreeriient should not toe vitiated, the preamble of the agreement mist be altered on the lines suggested toy /eightman In paragraph 3 of his letter under refer ence* A further point is that as the preamble reads now it seems to me that the agreement will only remain in force while Khalid is Regent, that is to say for another six years until the Shaikh attains hie maj ority. (c) I note that the agreement was concluded at Ajman. This in uy opinion is unfortunate as opportunity should have been afiorded for the Kalba notables to express their views according to Arab custom* I am afraid, therefore, that the circumstances under which the agreement was actually made may appear to the inhabitants of Kalba as somewhat dubious, unless Khalid indeed gave them previous information of the proposed agreement* (d) a most important point is, how is Khaiid going to di-spoee oi the money paid to him by the Company? He should of coarse pay it into the Kalba state on whose behalf he as Regent has received it. He will quite possibly in point of fact put it Into hia own pocket. His Majesty’s Government are not perhaps strictly respoiisible for how .Khalid disposes of the mon^r he receives /-3- receivea from the Company v but in local opinion inside Kalba and outeide it Hi a Majesty* s Goremment will certainly be held aorally responsible for guard ing the interests of the minor Uhaiich, and hia State. Until I am satisfied therefore that these interests have been safeguarded I suggest that His Majesty’s Government do not concur in the present agreement. (e) With regard to the territory as defined in \rticle 1 of the agreement, this coincides #ith His Majesty’s Government’s instructions - vide paragraph 1 of India Aw* Office letter No.P.ii.6232/36, dated the 28th Septem ber 1938. Chalid himself owns no territory, with the possible exception of Dhaid, to which the Shaikh of Sharjah can lay claim. In this connection see para graph 5 of Longrigg’s letter to hie Company dated the I s * * G ^ 20th December 1938. (f) In addition to the preamble, dealt with in (b) above, Chalid lias signed the agreement as iuler of Kalba. This designation should be cnanged on the lines suggested by ^eightman in paragraph 3 of his letter under reference. (g) There is no Article similar to Article 21 of the Debai agreement concerning transfer, and unless I am mistaken Veightrain’s views on this point (vide his paragraph 4 (b)) do not appear to cover an important point at issue, as tne agreement at present stands there is nothing to prevent Petroleum Development (frucial Joast) Ltd. from transferring the concession to, aay, an American Company. I am of the opinion, therefore /therefore, that an Article should be inserted limiting the transfer of the agreement to a British Company* (h) In regard to the Bank (Weightm&amp;n's paragraph 4 (c)). I think tnat a similar proviso should be inserted in the K&amp;lba agreement as is in the Deb&amp;i agreement. (1) It will be noticed that there is no provision that the agreement shall be subject to the approval of His of Majesty’s Government* In view however correa- * ^ J.H&gt;1 pondence ending with your telegram Ho. 19 of 3rd January I do not think that we need insist on this point* 3* With regard to Article 4 of the agreement. I agree with Weightraan that this clause should have formed the subject of a separate letter, as, however, it is in essence merely a promise of general help by 'halid to the Company in their negotiations I think it might be allowed to stand. I have no doubt, as Weightnan points out, that the agreement is perhaps as much to secure the personal friendship of Shaikh Khalid to the Company at to cover the prospect of an oil field in Kalba. Personally I rather doubt whether Khalid’s friendship is as valuable an asset as Longrigg appears to think, but that is a matter for the Company. 4, It would, of course, have been much better if Longrigg had consulted us as to the details of this agreement before actually concluding it. The only course now, it seems to me, is for Hia Majesty’s Government to inform the Company that until the points dealt with above have been settled. His Majesty’s Government /Government cannot approve of the agreement ad* T«C*Fo#le* political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Attested* % secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian fiulf*1 HJJ FUJ. eked. 10% The chief points v/hich occur to me are: (1) That, we had no previous knov/ledge that F. J.T. wished to obtain a concession from Kalba, thou £j h Mr.Longrigg states that the India Office have stated that there is no objection to F*J*L.obtaining a concession for Kalba f in fact it was well known that F.J.L. were not interested in Kalba. It therefore appears that the real intent of the concession is ( a ) to secure the concession over the Dhaid area which Mr.Fongrigg appears to be under the impression belongs to Khalid, v/hereas it belongs to the Shaikh of Sharjah and (b) to secure Khalid , s co-operation in conjunction v/ith P.C*L* # s desire to explore the Beni hi tab country* (2) That the concession was made in Ajman far from ITalba and that the Shaikhly family and wisemen of Kalba have not been (3) That the preamble of the concession is made out as between “Shaikh I'halid, Kegent of Kalba (hereinafter called the Shaikh} 1 ' therefore wherever 'Shaikh' appears in the concession it means Khalid who has signed as 'Kuler of Kalba and its dependencies'. He is not the Kuler* F*a* has commented on this point and 1 think that there can be no doubt that F.A.’s opinion that the concession is vitiated by the point is correct. (4) That Article 4 of the concession is as F.a. states out of place, but he thinks that no strong objection need be taken to it* Fersonally 1 do not agree. The purport is likely to be that Khalid will become the Jhief P.C.L. Agent, which in his Regency and Dhaid area may be well enough. But as 'Oman' is mentioned l sug 0 est the clause needs combing. Also I doubt if it is advisable to acquiesce in an Oil Company concluding under an agreement what is comparable with the interest of a political treaty or/ ^ ^or to recognise Ithalid’s binding himself to lend a hand in negotiations in territory which should not be c on ’s idered as under his influence. ' &lt;3 So far this winter Khalid has proved himself to be a broken reed, but if P.C.L. wish to conciliate '’•him I suppose we need not object, but to pay Khalid large suns mainly on account of Article 4 and only to spend ls.75 at Baraimi on actual exploration on the spot seems to me to be what we might expect of the half-witted tailor of Kuwait. J l think that we should definitely object to the preamble and form of signature as suggested by P.A. and the \rticle 4 over which P.A. has doubts also. a—</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/679</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/679</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Confidential 86/7 - ix B.52.

A copy of the political agreement can be found at folios 65-66. The negotiations ultimately concluded an exploration permit for the Shaikh’s territory; with an allowance within the permit to a subsequent agreement for drilling and exploitation should the results of the exploration be favourable.Also included is correspondence regarding the Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qasimī], Ruler of Sharjah’s refusal to undertake the previously agreed exchange of letters, including his attempt to reword one of the letters, and potential measures that could be used to compel him to complete the exchange prior to his eventual agreement and formal completion of the Sharjah Concession Agreement. A printed copy of the concession agreement, political agreement and letters exchanged can be found at folios 92-101.Further correspondence relates to the question of the political agreement and whether the agreement of the Trucial Coast Shaikh’s to such an agreement is necessary.The correspondence concludes that the agreement does not require the Shaikh’s approval however as Dubai and Sharjah had both previously agreed to the political agreement and the Regent of Kalba was happy to agree to it as part of the concession it was not necessary to take any action on the matter at that time. Also discussed is the requirement for HMG approval to the establishment of a bank as part of the agreement and whether this was necessary; and the movements of the Standard Oil Company of California and the likelihood that they were using their alleged interest in Trucial Coast Oil Concessions to improve their chances of obtaining a concession in the unallotted area in Bahrain.Other matters discussed in the volume include:attempts at re-opening negotiations with Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan [Shaikh Shakhbūt bin Sulṭān bin Zāyid Āl Nahyān], Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and the Shaikh’s insistence in writing that he was not bound by His Majesty’s Government approval and was free to negotiate with whomever he wished;a conversation between the India Office and Hamilton Ballantyne of the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) regarding representatives of the Shaikh of Bahrain (Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah) having alluded to the Shaikh’s desire to grant a concession for the remaining unallotted area of his territory to BAPCO but fearing that he would lose control of the Hawar Islands if he did so;Petroleum Concessions Limited’s interest in a negotiating concession for the territory of Kalba [Kalbā] with Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad bin Sultan [Shaikh Khālid bin Aḥmad bin Sulṭān Āl Qasimī], Regent to Shaikh Hamad bin Said [Shaikh Ḥamad bin Sa‘īd Āl Qasimī] who was a minor. The correspondence discusses the actual extent of Kalba territory; Shaikh Khalid’s desire to create a combined Qawasim [Qawāsim] Shaikhdom with himself as ruler and his close relations with the Bani Chittab [Beni Qitab] tribe; and the concession agreement that was reached between the two parties;printed summary issued by the Petroleum Department of His Majesty’s Government detailing petroleum developments in the Arabian Peninsula in relation to Petroleum Concessions Limited (folios 103-105, 127-129).A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 196-203.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Regent of Kalba</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Dhabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ras al Khaimah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Sharjah</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kalba</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Ra's al-Khaymah</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
