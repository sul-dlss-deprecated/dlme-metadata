MOLES WORTH SYKES. The ancient kingdom of Persia, to which I would draw your attention this evening, is perhaps one of the most attractive countries in the world, as not only is it rich in remains of a great antiquity, which have been the constant theme of historians for more than two thousand years, but to-day it presents so great a variety of interesting problems, and has so faithfully preserved its ancient immutable civilization, that every traveller who has once crossed its great plateau is fired with the desire to return again and again. Before approaching the subject of my three journeys, I would give a very brief description of the country upon which we are about to enter. The kingdom of His Imperial Majesty the Shah stretches, roughly speaking, for 1000 miles from east to west, and for 800 miles from north to south — an area rather larger than that of the countries composing the Triple Alliance. In the provinces which border the Caspian sea the rainfall is very heavy, but, with that small exception, the most noticeable feature is the dryness of Persia, and this is the main cause of its delightful climate. I have mentioned this before anything else, as it appears to me that sufficient attention has not been paid to the enormous effect that deforestation has had, not only on Persia, but on Central Asia generally. It is this fact, and this alone, I would urge, that explains why great armies were able to march across countries the sterility of which would, at the present time, bar the progress of anything beyond a very moderate force; and, conversely, it is upon the successful solution of this problem that the future of these desiccated regions (I use the term advisedly) depends. To continue, both on the north and south the great Frau plateau is held up-by mighty ranges, which aro traversal- by mule-tracts, and it is owing to the rugged nature of these passes that the isolation of Persia from the rest of the world is partly due. The plateau once reached, the traveller finds himself on a broad plain with mountain ranges on each side of him, which trend to the north-west with amazing regularity. For instance, when travelling to my district of Kerman, a distance of 600 miles from Tehran, I traversed the same great plain throughout, and never lost sight of the two parallel ranges at any portion of my journey. These mountains, which rise to great elevations, are, as my previous remarks would show, entirely bare of timber, while the whole country consists of a succession of oases, dependent for their existence upon “kanats.” By this term, underground channels which tap distant springs in the hills are meant, and it may be imagined how costly and laborious a system this is, the water being frequently carried from a distance of over 30 miles to the village it supplies. There are no navigable rivers in Persia, with the exception of the Karun, and it is extraordinary that between the Indus and this river, a distance of over 1500 miles, no considerable body of water reaches the sea. To the north, owing to the heavier rainfall, it is different, and there are two or three rivers of moderate volume flowing into the Caspian sea. , This summary would not be complete without a reference to the appalling wastes known respectively as the Dasht-i-Kavir and the as t i-Lut. These two great deserts, as a reference to the land maps will show, stretch right across Eastern and Central Persia, with the resu 11 at there is much less communication between neighbouring pi evinces t^e Persian Empire than their juxtaposition would lead one to expect, the wastes of salt-swamp and sand dividing the districts more com pletely than any range of mountains, however difficult its passes might be. . . It was at the beginning of 1893 that I obtained permission to rejoin my regiment, at that time stationed in the Punjab, via 1 ersia, an ^ first of all travelled to Odessa, where Colonel C. E. Stewart, Her Majesty e « &lt;^n- Paper read at the Royal Geographical Society, June 28, 1897.2 Geo.—Sykes—First Proof. consul-general, a prominent Fellow of this Society, not only gave me much valuable advice, but also furnished me with letters of introduction. In consequence, I did not enter Persia by the usual route, but crossed from Baku to Uzun-Ada, the starting-point of the Transcaspian railway, and thence steamed down the eastern coast of the Caspian to its south east corner. At Ashurada, a tiny island off the coast of Mazanderan, we lay to off the Russian naval station for a few hours, and soon after reached the end of the “ Murdab,” or lagoon, where we rowed through myriads of duck and every sort of aquatic bird, all strangely tame, to the rickety pier of Bunder Gez, after traversing which we found ourselves nearly up to the knees in mud. There being no hotel, and tents being out of the question, we were only too glad to find quarters at the telegraph office, where we received a warm welcome. After two days’ delay, we started for Astrabad in wet weather, and enjoyed a very full experience of what muddy roads can be. The mules were not so badly off, their loads being high up on their backs; but the ponies, which carried my servant and myself, must have been very weary, as we could hardly ever keep our feet out of the mud, so deep was it. Five hours’ marching through this mire only brought us 7 miles on our way; but, as we were told that the road upon the morrow was much better, we decided to halt for the night, and found quarters in the village of Kurd Mahalla, in the house of its headman, who holds the rank of major in the Persian army. Our host professed himself a profound theological student, and, after introducing the subject generally by stating that all Europeans worshipped machines, was anxious to know whether we English worshipped a steamer or a locomotive. On the following morning the country, which had hitherto been a melancholy tangle of low thorns and bushes, became quite park-like, and, as it cleared up, matters looked more cheerful. On passing through the village, which covers a large area, as every one lives inside a garden, we saw wheat being thrashed by means of a see-saw—a girl sitting on one end of the plank, and pulling herself up and down by a rope suspended above her. It was nearly sunset when, amid a deafening chorus of jackals, we entered the city of Astrabad, through a dilapidated gate. Inside not a soul was to be seen, and we rode on for a considerable distance before we pounced upon a stray citizen, whom we induced to guide us to the house of the British agent. My first inquiries were as to the possibility of travelling up the river Atrek to Bujnurd, but my host told me that the country was so disturbed, that the Persian government would insist on sending a large escort with me, which would have effectually prevented my mixing with the Turkomans, and so I determined not to seek any aid from the authorities. For about a week I made constant shooting-trips into the Elburz range, during the course of which I bagged a few wild boars, but saw no signs of the magnificent stags that roam the beautiful forests. Meanwhile my preparations were being qxiietly made, and I marched off due north to the Gurgan river, across a rich alluvial plain, until we sighted Ak-Kala, a fort that commands the bridge over the Gurgan, and the home of the present royal family of Persia. We then turned due east, and followed up the river until we reached the encampment of Moussa Khan, the chief of the Ak Ata Bai, the most powerful tribe of Yomut Turkomans. The camp consisted of about thirty “ alachuk, and as I lived in these very superior nomad dwellings for nearly a month, it might be as well to describe them. We must first of all imagine a huge beehive framework of wood, some 16 feet in diameter, over which thick black felt is stretched, and we have an ideal movable house, which, in cold weather, is infinitely superior to any tent. Inside are the “ lares and penates,” packed up in big trunks, while the rifles of the owners hang within easy reach. Strips of carpet are stretched round wherever there are joinings in the’ felt, and altogether, when the fire is lit on the hearth, one enjoys a feeling of real comfort. I fortunately had a letter of introduction from Colonel Stewart for my host, and in it my plan of travelling up the Atrek was mentioned. Moussa at first, however, utterly declined to help me, averring that I3 Geo.—Sykes—First Proof, was sure to be robbed, if not killed, in which case he would be held responsible by the Persian Government. Ho was also at a loss to know the object of my journey, and, as Colonel Stewart had not mentioned that I was an officer travelling on leave, I told him that I was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. When he found out that the object of this Society was merely the collection of geographical information, he could not conceal his contempt for a body which took such pains to find out facts that did not concern it in any way, while I am afraid that he thought me mentally weak for taking so much trouble without the hope of making money thereby. For three days nothing was settled, a hot discussion being eternally carried on in Turkish, until I told him that if he would not help me he would lower his reputation for hospitality in Europe, and, as I also pre sented him with a revolver, he finally agreed to send me on to the Atrek, where further arrangements would be made. It was across the snowy steppe that we marched, after bidding fare well to our host at the ford of the Gurgan, or Wolf river, which is apparently a faithful translation of Hyrcania, the Greek name for this district. After a weary march we sighted the Atrek, and were glad to reach an encampment, as the snow was falling somewhat heavily. In the morning I was informed that forage for the next five stages must ,be bought, as none could be procured further on. This was followed by an intimation that I must purchase a camel for £40 to carry it. Fortunately, I guessed that the desire to stick me with a camel at ten times its value was the reason for the alleged scarcity of barley, so I declined to do anything but move on. This was not so easy, as the Yomut Turkomans are very loathe to spee 1 the parting guest without first fleecing him, so that it was noon before the march was resumed, more or less parallel to the yellow- coloured Atrek, to which river, as to the Tiber, the epithet of “ flavus is most appropriate. Our way lay across what should be a fertile country, but the treeless, snow-covered steppe looked extremely dreary, and, to add to our dis comfort, no meat was procurable, as all the sheep were dying of some disease, and we had, consequently, to depend upon shooting a few pigeons, which were extremely hard to approach. For two or three days we were accompanied by a “ mollah,” or priest, and under his guidance we steadily ascended the left bank of the Atrek, as far as a point opposite Chat, where we forded the river, and followed up the right bank through a mass of low hills. Our escort consisted of three or four Turkomans, who, whenever they met another party, took the most warlike precautions, until they discovered whether those approaching were friends or foes. About 20 miles from Chat our priestly guide intimated that he was going no further, so, before continuing our march the next morning, I sent him a silver watch and a present of money. This, however, he returned without thanks, and said that he would like my telescopic-sighted rifle, which he had greatly admired. At the same time the muleteers came in weeping and howling, as they said that the Turkomans were going to take their mules and also rob me. I tried to quiet them, and sent my servant into the “ alachuk to harangue the heads of the tribe, while I got the mules loaded up. For an hour we waited, hearing only a stormy flow of Purki from the council-room, so, when the mules were ready, I thought that I had better see what was going on. I found Joseph dancing about in an agitated state, and upon my entrance he told me that they plainly spoke of robbery, and would not let us leave. He advised the rather foolish expedient of attacking them; but, instead, I told him to say how I loved the mollah, and I patted that scoundrel so violently on the back to show my atlection, that he could not go on speaking. The Turkomans thought it very funny, and when I ran the mollah outside, they brought his horse, and he came along with me just as. if everything had been arranged to his satisfaction. I forgot to mention that, before the acute stage was reached, I was asked to give a letter for him to show in case of complaints. In it I wrote that I expected to be robbed, and only hoped that any future traveller would thrash him had he the chance. Before saying good-bye to our friend, who only • X S3 ;4 Geo.—Sykes—First Proof. accompanied us for a couple of miles, I offered to give him a second note. This he felt sure would not be as laudatory as he imagined the first to be, so he said that the former one would suffice, and I am confident that he considers it to be couched in the most complimentary terms. That night we were not asked into the village near which we halted, so, surmising from this pointed lack of hospitality that treachery was intended, we kept watch. At about 2 a.m. some six or seven Turkomans sneaked quietly out with their rifles, and approached the tent. Finding that we were awake, they appeared to be surprised, and, after talking together, went quietly back to bed. As we were close to the country of the Goklans, I decided to change my tactics, and on the following morning abused the Turkomans for their violation of hospitality, and threatened them with the vengeance of the Governor of Bujnurd, who was, I said, a great friend of the British Government. This bluff, which, I am sure, lost nothing when interpreted into Turki, had its effect, and our guides, finding the game up, rode away, and, after firing a few shots at us from about half a mile off, to which we made no reply, left us in peace. The Goklan Turkomans received us in quite a different manner, and said that Huck Nafass, our mollah, was not only wanted by the Persian Government for several acts of robbery, but that any Goklan would shoot him on sight, had he the chance. I was consequently delighted to feel that I had escaped from his clutches without harm, and can only put it down to the fact that, although I was without an escort, he imagined that I held some very strong cards up my sleeve. We were soon joined by Mustapha Kuli, who had been Captain ^Napier s guide in 1877, and it is, I think, entirely thanks to him that I was so well treated. We were told that the road to Bujnurd lay across the Hanaki pass to the south, and that we were to quit the Atrek, up which we had been marching hitherto. The cold was intense, although it was the middle of February, but once over the pass we descended rapidly, until, at Semalgan, where we joined the usual Astrabad-Bujnurd road, we found the heat quite oppressive. Before reaching the town of Bujnurd, however, we had to cross another range of hills, where the fresh snow was so deep that it took us hours to accomplish even a few miles. Upon reaching the plain, wherein lies the city, I had my first experience of an “ istakbal,” or reception, a troop of Persian cavalry escorting us to the town, where we were lodged in one of the governor’s houses. When we went to pay our respects, we were conducted up the winding staircase of a tower into the presence of the Sani-i-Dowleh, the redoubtable warden of the marches, who for fifty years has been warring against the Turkomans. His Excellency told me, that when he was a young man it was impossible for any one to till the fields alone, and that at Bujnurd there were generally some hundreds of Turkoman prisoners, waiting to be ransomed or exchanged for captive Kurds. Nowadays there is comparative peace, cattle-lifting on a small scale having taken the place of the wholesale raids of the good old times. I was very glad of rest for a day or two, but the feeling that 1 was near my fellow-countrymen at Meshed, where I also hoped for letters, urged me on, and I was soon on the road to Kuchan, which has recent y suffered from the calamity of two earthquakes, causing the death of thcusands. ^ ^ visit there was a great deal of life at this centre, owing to its being on the “chaussee” that has been constructed between Askabad and Meshed. Soon after my arrival the postmaster came to call, and informed me, in the course of half an hours con versation, that he had a letter for me. As may be rmagined, I was extremely anxious to open it, and was rather annoyed he a, r dy remarked that he had not brought it with him About - hour he left, his servant came to tell me that the letter was lost bu was being searched for; and it was not until midnight that miss, g document was produced.5 Geo.—Sykes'—First Proof. For the remaining 90 miles I hired a waggon, its owner agreeing to reach Meshed on the third day; and so we started off with the pleasant feeling that this section of the journey was an accomplished fact. Unfortunately, at about 5 miles from Kuchan one of the horses had a violent attack of colic; so we had to halt for the night, as the poor beast was quite unfit to proceed, and it was not until February 28 that I drew up at the consulate-general at Meshed, where I was warmly welcomed by Mr. Ney Elias, whose untimely death this Society is now deploring. In his obituary notice, mention was made of the kindness he showed to all his juniors, and of this I have received innumerable proofs during the five years that have elapsed since I was first his guest. Meshed, as is well known, contains the famous shrine of the holy Keza, the last of the twelve Imams, and is the religious centre of Persia. The mosque is of great magnificence, and I hope to give a fair repre sentation of its exterior on the screen. I was much tempted to linger at Meshed, but, as every week’s delay meant more heat in the Dasht-i- Lut, I had to htirry through with my preparations, and after a week’s stay I continued my southward journey. As far as Turbat I was on a well-known road, which had been travelled over by Dr. Bellew in the seventies; but between Turbat and Jumain I found that several villages shown on the map were in ruins or unknown, while the river, termed the Kal Salah, which is shown as flowing east, actually trends to west, and is lost in the swamps to the north of Bajistan. At Tun I was on the northern edge of the great Dasht-i-Lut, which lay between us and Kerman, and which has not been traversed, in this particular portion, since the illustrious Marco Polo crossed it, in the opposite direction, when travelling from Kerman to Tonoca via Cobinan. As the great Venetian was not only a most accurate observer, but also wielded a graphic pen, I feel sure that I cannot do better than give his words, when describing the Dasht-i-Lut, which signifies the “Naked Icsart ”—a most appropriate name. He says, “ When you depart from this city of Cobinan, you find yourself in a desert of surpassing aridity. There are neither fruits nor trees to be seen, and what water there is is bitter and bad, so that you have to carry both food and water. The cattle must needs drink the bad water, will they nill they, because of their great thirst.” Friar Odoricus, in the succeeding century, who was apparently struck by another phase of the desert, describes it in the following lines, as if he were referring to a sea. He says, “ Now, that sea is a wondrous thing, and right perilous. For it is all of dry sand, without any moisture, and it shifteth, as the sea doth when in storm, now hither, now thither; and as it shifteth it maketh waves, so that countless people travelling thereon have been overwhelmed and drowned, and buried in those sands.” Our chief preparation consisted in engaging a few donkeys to carry forage for our mules, and, as there were said to be tanks with water on the way, we expected very little trouble. We soon left the Tun oasis behind, and entered the silent desert, where not even a crow is to be At the fourth mile was a tank of sweet water, where I insisted upon filling up my private water-skin, and at night we halted near the well of Khushab,' which means sweet water. However, it was much too sa t for me, so I was very glad indeed that I had taken the precaution to fill my “ mussuck.” , . , On the following morning, after drinking tea, only a pint remained; but we were promised excellent water at the evening’s stage of Ghahar Gunbaz, and so commenced the march in hope. Throughout the day we approached a snow-clad range, whic a PPf a ^® on no map, and, as we were at the end of March, I estimated its height at 7000 or 8000 feet. „ The heat and thirst were very trying and, to add to our iscom or , the water at the stage was simply green with salt. I attempted to drl “ it with lime-juice tablets dissolved in it, but in vain, and so I could only envy the others, who were able to swallow it with apparently no ill results.6 Geo.—Sykes—First Proof. We were only about 15 miles from Duhuk, which lay under the range referred to; so, after a sleepless night, we pressed on as soon as it was light, and by 10 a.m. we were able to enjoy beautiful water running down from the hills. The villagers were intently anxious to see the first European that had passed that way, but, considering their isolation, knew a good deal about what was going on in the world. We had to halt a day, as every one experienced such bad effects from the water of the day before, that I w'as most thankful not to have touched it. Duhuk is built in a gap half a mile wide, which separates the Tabas Kuh from the Mur Kuh, which latter range runs south-south-east towards Naiband. The onward journey lay through Arababad and Zenagun, where we saw palm trees for the first time. Another waterless stretch lay between us and Naiband, so, warned by experience, we hired three donkeys to carry water, and marched to Ab-i-garm, where there are extensive salt marshes and groves of tamarisk. As we had still nearly 30 miles to accomplish, I tried to push on at night, but we were afraid of losing the track, and so lay down to sleep until daylight. Our water was again exhausted, the skins having tainted it, so I rode on, in order to reach Naiband before the heat of the day. Fortunately the track was fairly distinct, but as hour after hour passed, and my pony began to be dead beat, I feared that I had lost my way, especially as there were two or three places where there was a choice of routes. Finally, however, I turned a corner and came upon a vision of fairyland. The hillside was covered with date palms, underneath which were glimpses of the bright green crops, and at the summit was an old fort in a state of picturesque ruin. Upon entering the grove, I saw streams in every direction, while huge natural grottoes completed the picture. My fiist care was to send off two donkeys laden with water, in charge of a man who knew the country, and in the evening the caravan came in, the water having reached them some 5 miles out, when they were all feeling too tired to go another yard. Two or three days were spent in climbing about the Naiband range while the mules were recovering, after which we had another waterless stretch of 39 miles, to a well with forty steps, which was said to be a favourite spot for Beluchi raids. During the next stage to Darband, we passed ruins that I believe to be those of Marco Polo’s Cobinan, as the modern Kuhbenan does not at all fit in with the great traveller’s description, and it is Jjust as well to remember that in the East the caravan routes seldom change. We now skirted the western edge of the Dasht-i-Lut, and followed the main caravan road until at Ab-Bid we kept away to the east, in order to explore the district of Kuhpayeh, which was then a blank on the map. We found that it contained numerous villages, and had an excellent climate, while at the time of our visit it was carpeted with hyacinths. , , ,, We approached Kerman from the east, and I little thought that within so short a time it was to be my home. The city lies at the end of a low limestone range, which was once impregnable, to judge by the huge old forts that are still imposing in their decay. The position of the city on the confines of the great desert, and at the confluence of four important routes, has always rendered it of importance, but, being on the frontier of Afghanistan, it has suffered terribly at each invasion from that quarter, as well as in the great fight for power that took place at the end of last century. The only buildings of any interest now left are the Kubeh-i-subs, which was finished just about the time of Marco’s journeys, and the Jabal-i-Sang, a stone shrine, perhaps of Arab architecture. _ _ Nowadays it is on account of its carpets that Kerman is justly famous, specimens of which will be shown in the adjoining room. I must, however, state that the so-called Kerman carpets sold in London must have been woven at some other Kerman than the one I refer to, as, both in design and quality, they are much inferior to the exquisite products of the looms of Kerman in 1 ersia. During my stay of a week I met several of the merchants of the place, both Mohammedan and Parsi, and I was particulail} struc y&gt; Geo.—Sykes—First Proof. 7 their very polished manners, which are, I afterwards heard, renowned throughout Persia. As the result of inquiries, X determined to take a straight line to Pariz and Baonat, as thereby I could fill in several blanks on the map, while, as the altitude was fairly high throughout, I should not suffer from the heat. When some five marches to the west of Kerman, I received a most cordial invitation to visit H.R.H. the Farman Farma, who was the Governor-General of Kerman and Persian Beluchistan, and, upon accepting it, was so hospitably entertained that I accompanied my new friend to Bahramabad. Among many other experiences, I was introduced to the sport of shooting gazelles off horseback, which con sisted in the riders spreading across a plain with intervals of 500 or 600 yards between each, and driving the quarry off its feeding-ground. In time the gazelles break back, when the sportsmen gallop to cut them off, and shoot them with slugs propelled by a heavy charge ol powder. The Farman Farma, who is one of the greatest sportsmen in Persia, on more than one occasion shot a right and a left at full gallop. I have seen hyenas, lynxes, foxes, and hares bagged in the same way. When, after being entertained right royally for about a fortnight, I resumed my journey, I had had an agreeable experience of Persian life, enjoyed by very few travellers, coupled with a warm invitation to return during the following winter. Upon entering Baonat, we were followed by a band of seven nomads, who were evidently on the look-out to attack us. However, we took all precautions, and maintained a bold front. Although both my rifle and gun were broken, we carried them in a very conspicuous manner. This band kept parallel to our march for three days, but they fortunately did not otherwise molest us. It is a remarkable coincidence that Captain Stotherd, of the Hyderabad Contingent, was set upon less than a month later, about 30 miles to the south of where I was, and, although he had only a single orderly with him, he accounted for four of the brigands, killing their chief. It is more than probable that he was attacked by the same gentlemen who took so keen an interest in my movements, and it is satisfactory to feel that Captain Stotherd made so good an im pression on them. Upon arrival at Shiraz, I was most kindly received by Dr. Scully, who told me that I had come at an interesting crisis, as there was war to the death between the townspeople and the nomads. The very next morning we were awakened by hearing volleys inside the town, and, climbing up to the roof of the telegraph garden, which is about half a mile from the city, we saw a regular fight taking place at the gate nearest to us. Fortunately, we were at right angles to the line of fire, and so could look on without much risk, until the nomads, who were greatly outnumbered, finally retreated. During these very stormy times, it was wonderful to see with what utter contempt for danger the English telegraph officials behaved, and it was mainly owing to the confidence felt in their reports at Tehran that the necessary steps were taken to patch up a peace. It was now the end of May, so it was necessary to travel b^ nigiit down the famous passes of the Old Woman and of her Daughter, which have been so vividly described in Mr. Curzon s monumental work , so that, after turning night into day for nearly a week, I was only too pleased to find myself on board the British India steamer at Bushire, where white bread and a whisky peg appeared to be delicious beyond expression. Karachi was reached early in June, and the rest of the summer was spent in compiling my work and planning fresh journeys, until, in October, 1893, accompanied by Surgeon-Major Brazier Creagh and Lieut. Duffadar Sultan Sukhru, of the 3rd Punjab Cavalry, I again landed at Chahbar, in Persian Beluchistan. This port was chosen, as since Grant’s journey, some ninety years ago, no European had travelled to Bampur by Geh. Before, however, entering Persian Beluchistan, a few words as to its character would perhaps not be out of place. The whole of the coast line from Bashikird nearly to Karachi is spoken of as Makran, the dis trict extending inland as far as the first important range of hills, thus including a strip of land from 60 to 70 miles wide. lor some 20 to 40v_y Geo.—Sykes—First Proof. ® miles from the coast there is a sand desert, with small hamlets, which draw their supply of water from shallow wells. Behind this is another belt of about the same size, consisting of low hills composed of mud or slate. Proceeding further inland, it will be noticed that there are continuous ranges of mountains running from east to west parallel to the sea. and so regular is this formation, that all attempts at opening up com munications in these parts must be done either to the east or west, as any road direct to the coast will lead over range after range of rugged hills. Thanks to the kindness of Mr. Possman, the director-general of the Persian Gulf telegraphs, we found camels awaiting us at Chahbar, and, owing to the exertions of Mr. Lorell, in charge of the telegraph office, we were able to get twenty-seven camels loaded up the day after landing our six horses and stores. The quarrels as to the partition of loads, and the interest taken by so many people in the camels, revealed to us the fact that several of these animals were divided into legs, each of which had a separate owner. The usual plan, we were informed, was for the driver to have one leg s interest in each camel, which was allowed in lieu of wages and rations. Our first march brought us to Tez, the famous Arab port in mediaeval times, but now no signs of departed greatness exist, except the innumer' able tombs of deceased worthies, and we had to drink filthy water out of a shallow hole, and be thankful that there was enough for all our party. Although marching by day was terribly trying for man and beast alike, the Beluchis spent so long in wrangling over the loads, and in tying them on, that it was 10 a.m. before the last of our camels started, and, as the road at first lay along the coast at the foot of a cliff, our horses very soon began to give in. We therefore halted for several hours in the shade, near some water-holes, riding on to camp in the evening. We there found only about half of our caravan, the other portion having halted 2 or 3 miles back, in a rage at being compelled to march some 12 miles, as they said that 7 miles is the limit of a march in Beluchistan. All travellers in this country should be provided with an inex haustible fund of patience, as the only part that the Beluchi camel- driver plays is to prevent any load whatever being put on his camel, while, if at all discontented, they will all decamp without giving any notice. In order to try for an earlier start, we halted for a day, and then pushed on at sunrise the following morning. However, the march was long, and by the time we reached Pesh Mant our horses had to be led, so utterly prostrate were they. Many of the party also suffered from sun fever, mainly because they got slightly chilled before the sun rose, and so felt the sudden change acutely. After four trying marches, we struck the Geh river, where we decided to make another halt. Just before reaching camp, I saw a couple of wolves, which fact is interesting, as they are not known to exist so near the coast. In the bed of the “ kaur,” the Beluchi term for river, we found isolated pools of doubtful water; but a march higher up, we came upon a bright flowing stream, bordered by palm groves. Geh is a large village, built on the fork between two branches of the river, and, with its large palm groves, forms a delighttul picture. As so many of our party had suffered from fever, we determined to make a rapid march in light order to Fanoch, and return to Geh by a different route. This we did with great success, finding at Mokht, a village near our route, a remarkable kind of glass bangle, of which I have given specimens to the British Museum. The pass below Fanoch must be a unique road. For 7 or 8 miles one has to scramble over boulders of the most varied hues, every colour of the rainbow being there, which gives an effect of great beauty. My companion’s geological researches convinced the governor of Fanoch that we must be in want of stone, and he was much disappointed when we showed no inclination to deal. Upon our return route, which was also across unexplored country, we struck the main river at Ichan, and so back to Geh. \\ e here found9 Greo.—Sykes—First Proof. every one quite well again, and as we were arranging for our onward journey, we were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a party of Beluchis, who had been sent down by the governor of Beluchistan to escort us to Bampur. They brought a letter from H.R.H. the Farman Farma, who welcomed me back to his province, and said that he would be at Bampur in January. Our journey to the Beluch capital was thus resumed under more favourable auspices, as no longer had we to waste hours in trying to buy barley, as it was at once produced—such a pleasant change. The Sirha pass beggars description, and I am still surprised that we got safely over it, as I should never have believed that laden camels could climb up the cliffs they did without accident. My companion’s mare did indeed fall, but luckily there was a deep pool below, so no harm was done. v At Bampur we found that Pahra was now the seat of government! and so pushed on there, where we were received by the Assad-i-Dowleh, who is a fitting ruler for such a wild race. He was civil enough, thanks to the Farman Farma; but when we informed him of our inten tion of touring in Sarhad, he tried to stop us by every means in his power. Having engaged camels with extreme difficulty, we marched due east to Magas, where the kindest inquiries were made after the late Sir Oliver St. John. We then turned north into unexplored country, and at the end of December reached Khwash, the capital of Sarhad. This word has been written and spelt in so many different ways, that I would mention that it is the Sarhaddi way of pronouncing “ khosh,” meaning “ sweet.” We were now close to the great volcano of Taftan, or the “ boiling,’ locally known as Chehel Tan, or the “ Mountain of the Forty Beings,” and as we were afraid that snow might hinder our ascent, we marched up its valley, where we camped at an altitude of 6550 feet, near a large cave, which protected our horses from the intense cold. My com panion was unfortunately ill, so, as the weather looked very threatening, I decided not to wait, but to make the attempt at once. For .7 miles the track led up the valley, which then terminated in an extraordinary fissure, termed the Band-i-Gelu. Creeping up this, we found ourselves in a valley, which smelt strongly of sulphur, but the going was easy enough until we began to climb the actual peak. First of all, we had to scramble over boulders, but these at 10,000 feet were replaced by soft lava ash, so that it was 2 p.m., after eight hours’ incessant climbing, when we reached the summit at 12,850 feet. We here found a plateau about 400 yards square, the northern portion of which is termed the Kuh-i-Ziarat, or “ Sacrifice hill,” while separated by a tiny valley lay the Mader Kuh, or Mother hill, which is still the actual object of worship for most Sarhaddis, although nominally they are Mohammedans. The volcano, which was belching out blinding clouds of sulphurous smoke, consists of two apertures, each some 3 yards in circumference, which apparently united a few feet below the surface, as there was only a yard or so of ground between them. With considerable difficulty, we extricated specimens of the sulphur and sal ammoniac, and then turned our attention to plane tabling. At the elevation we were at, we could see Sistan and the lake of Zirreh, mentioned in Matthew Arnold’s great poem, while to the north-west the boundless Dasht-i-Lut stretched for hundreds of miles. The descent was easy, in comparison, and by 9 p.m. we were safely back again in camp. The whole of this valley is full of ruined villages, opposite which are oval-shaped caves hewn out of the rock. These were some 8 feet in length, 6 feet in width, and 5 feet in height. No marks of smoke were visible, and, as they were very difficult of access, I would hazard the theory that they were humble imitations of the rock tombs at Pasar- gardae. After stopping long enough to allow my companion to scale the great volcano, on New Year’s Day, 1894, we started forth to find the village of Basman. As we could buy nothing on the way, we ran out of both forage and flour, and were consequently delighted to reach Basman, which lies at the southern end of the range of that name. Our camel-drivers here10 I Qeo.—Sykes—First Proof. j i V Tl » deserted in a body, but, as there was plenty to occupy us in exploring the range, this did not prove to be a serious blow. It took us three days to scale the great peak, so deep was the snow . but at last we arrived at the summit, and set up the plane-table at an altitude of 11,210 feet above the sea. We were on what is generally supposed to be an extinct volcano, and it is interesting to note that even here there is a legend of a saint called Kedr, who still lives in the mountain, just as in Greek mythology a giant is imprisoned beneath Etna. Upon returning to Basman, we enjoyed excellent moufflon-shooting, until the Farman Farma sent some of his transp jrt for our use, and we rejoined him at Bampur. In his company we travelled along the un explored tract of country where the Bampur river and the Halil Rud mingle their waters in the Jaz Morian. Additional interest was felt by us, knowing it to have been the road that Alexander the Great used in his march from India. Upon arrival in Rudbar, we turned northwards and left the Farman Farma, in order to explore the site of Marco Polos Camadi, where the china exhibited in the next room, together with the seals and other ourios, were all dug up. We came upon a huge area littered with yellow bricks 8 feet square, while not even a broken wall is left to mark the site of what was formerly a great city. It was now late in March, so we were only too glad to traverse the Jabal Bariz range and gain the elevated plateau of Iran, and, just a year after my first journey, I again entered Kerman. Here our party broke up, Surgeon-Major Brazier Creagh returning to India by Bunder Abbas, while I continued my journey towards Tehran. At Yezd I was most hospitably entertained by the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and at Tehran, Mr. Coningham Greene, Her Majesty’s charge d’affaires, not only made me free of the Legation, but also presented me to H.I.M. the late Shah, who was interested at hear ing about so remote a corner of his empire. I travelled to England in rather over a fortnight by the newly opened line from Petrovsk, on the Caspian sea, taking my faithful plane- tabler with me as a reward for his excellent work, reaching London late in June. After four months at home, during which my second journey was compiled, I was appointed to be the first consul for Kerman and Persian Beluchistan, and, accompanied by my sister, who shared my future wanderings throughout, we reached Tehran at the end of 1894.. We there spent a most delightful winter, enjoying the kind hospitality of Sir Mortimer and Lady Durand, so that it was a great wrench to leave all civilization behind and start forth on the long journey of 600 miles, which lay between us and my district. As far as Kashan, we followed my route of 1894, but for the onward march to Yezd I kept a good deal to the east, passing through Natunz and Kuhpa. Thereby I was able to fill in a large blank that has existed on the map quite close to Ispahan, while, as so often happens m Persia, I found the district to be quite as populous as the one bordering the main road. Kerman was reached at the end of March, and for some months we were busy enough, what with consular work and settling down. When, however, it grew hot in June, I determined to explore bar u, so as to trace out Marco Polo’s route, and we had a most delightful trip, during which we scaled the highest peak of the Lalazar range, 13,700 feet above sea-level-no mean feat for a lady to accomplish. There was also the best of moufflon-shooting, and we picked up several carpets woven by the nomads, while the climate at an altitude of over feet was perfection. However, we were forced to return home by quick march(* to meet H.R.H. the Farman Farma, who was once again governor of the pro vince, and the autumn was spent at Kerman, as we found interest g occupation in trying to unravel the ancient history of that city, not say we were very successful, as our offers of a reward for o and curios only produced a number of reflet tiles, a selection owe you will see in the next room. . . . . In January, 1896, telegraphic orders came for me to join Co -meGeo.—Sykes—First Proof. j j Holdich on the Porso-Beluch frontier, which instructions I should have been quite unable to obey, without considerable delay, had not my kiud friend, the Farman Farma, lent me his own transport. Thanks to that, we started off on the third day, leaving our household goods to look after themselves, and within a week we had reached Bam, until recently the frontier fortress of Persia. Everywhere I was shown the greatest courtesy, so that forage and supplies, which usually are impossible to collect, were ready at each stage, while from Regan, with only a day's halt, we were able to load up fifteen extra camels with all supplies, before crossing the desert that lay between us and Pahra. There my old acquaintance, the Assad-i-Dowleh, treated us well, and it only took two days to engage thirty spare camels and to load up supplies for twenty days, as the villages to the east were too small to be counted upon to any great extent. As far as Magas we followed the route of the previous year, after which we continued nearly due east, reaching the British camp at Kohuk on February 24, after accomplishing the march of 600 miles, mainly across desert, in forty days. Colonel Holdich has already read an interesting paper about the geographical side of the frontier com- : mission, during which we marched with our headquarters as far as Jalk, while excursions were made to the various points of interest along the frontier. Both at Jalk and Kohuk we found numerous tombs which were built by the Kaianian maliks, and which will appear on the screen. On one of these I found a brick bearing the date of 1027 Anno Hejra, or 1617 of our era. This confederacy of chieftains appears to have ruled in Sistan and Beluchistan during the prosperity of the Sefavi dynasty, and, as far as we know, they were finally crushed by Nadir Shah about 150 years ago. We accompanied the British Commission on its long march to Quetta, so that my sister may claim to be the first lady who has ridden (from the Caspian sea to India, a distance of nearly 2000 miles. While travelling up the valley of the Rakshan, through what is now a desert, we saw that for miles the country had been cultivated in terraces on such a scale that there must have been a teeming population where now one can wander for 50 miles without seeing the slightest sign of life. We found many ruined sites, with numberless fragments of pottery, beads, and bracelets, and felt that it was only deforestation that could have changed the country from a smiling plain of plenty to a barren and dry land, where no water is. Daily the thermometer registered over 90° in our tents, so it was with light hearts that we ascended on to the uplands of Beluchistan, until, at Kalat, we again reached a telegraph wire—that pioneer of civilization—and at the end of April we entered Quetta, where we were all most kindly entertained by the late Sir James Browne, whose name will live long on the Beluch country side. We were on the way to Simla, when the sad news of His Majesty the Shah’s death reached us, and it was quite touching to see how much our Persian servants felt the calamity that had befallen their native country. Nearly a month was spent in Simla, during which I was enabled to compile all my work up to date, and at the beginning of June we were once again at Karachi, bound for the Karun valley. We were caught by the beginning of the “ monsoon,” and, as we were on board the worst roller that the British India Company possesses, we were very glad to reach the shelter of the Persian Gulf. For the first time I visited Bahrein, when we rode on donkeys to the famous wells, and saw the extraordinary phenomenon of a spring of fresh water bubbling up in the sea, which is very shallow indeed all round the islands. The pearl fisheries were in full swing, and it was a most picturesque sight to see the fleet of little vessels all busily engaged in fishing for oysters. The weather was too hot and our stay too short for a visit to the site of the excavations; but there are few places so accessible that would, in my humble opinion, yield a richer harvest than this ancient aome of the Phoenicians, where Erythras, the “ Red King,” lies buried.12 Geo.—Sykes—First Proof. Off Bushire we again experienced rough weather, but when once we entered the lovely Shat-el-Arab, the moist heat was overpowering. At Mohamerah we found that the fortnightly boat was not due to start up the Karun for another week, so we continued our journey to Busreh, where Captain Whyte, Her Majesty’s consul, received us most hospitably. Before entering the valley of the Karun, I would mention that that river was opened to the commerce of the world in 1888, and that ever since Messrs. Lynch Brothers have maintained a fortnightly service, in spite of much hostile intrigue on the part of the local officials, who did their best to thwart the Shah’s policy. However, the extraordinary tact of Messrs. Lynch s agents has overcome much obstruction, and every one is now alive to the advantages that they have conferred upon the district, so that we may soon hope to see this system of mutual advantage placed on a thoroughly sound and solid basis. It is but 117 miles from Mohamerah to Ahwaz, but this occupied the best part of two days to accomplish, as we anchored at night. At Ahwaz, where a few years ago there were but a few wretched huts, warehouses and caravanserais of imposing appearance now line the bank, while great activity was everywhere visible. After spending a few days with Messrs. Lynch’s agent, Mr. Parry, in his company I proceeded up to Shuster in the s.s. Shmhan, the larger boat not being able to proceed above the natural barrage that crosses the river in five separate reefs. This is the crux of the Karun question, as, if the ancient dam were repaired, there would be water enough to fertilize millions of acres which now lie idle and useless. At Shuster, one of the dirtiest, hottest, and most fanatical towns in the world, we lived in cellars for the greater part of the day, as at 8 a.m. the thermometer regularly registered 108° Fahr., while at noon 129° was the average reading. As may be supposed, we were only too glad to return to the compara tively cool climate of Ahwaz, where July was spent. In August, I was so weak from fever and pleurisy that I had to seek medical advice at Busreh, and enjoyed every luxury at the consulate. The moist heat was, however, so trying that the doctor ordered a sea voyage, so that early in September we returned to Tehran by the roundabout way of Bombay, Aden, Brindisi, and Constantinople. I was, however, very anxious to have the Ahwaz-Ispahan road properly mapped as far as its junction with the Shuster route, as, until quite recently, Ahwaz did not exist, and so there was no road running to it shown on the map. Here the great value of my faithful plane-tabler came in, as I was able to send him in charge of my caravan through the Bakhtiari country and feel quite confident that when we met again at Tehran, he would have an excellent route report to give in, in which hope I was not disappointed. The winter was again spent at Tehran, where I saw H.I.M. Muzzufur- i-din Shah more than once, and his Majesty took much interest in the photographs that I had taken on the Beluch frontier. Moreover, I had the opportunity of making the acquaintance of the leading Persian statesmen, one of whom, His Excellency the Nasir-ul-Mulk, is here to-night, having returned to England the moment his official duties on thecontinent were finished. In conclusion, I would mention that, after travelling for many thousand miles in Persia, listill wish to travel there again, and, although perhaps the free open-air life and the glorious.climate have something to do with this, I cannot but help feeling that it is also owing to the Persians themselves being so hospitable and friendly a race.A ZfyJ &lt;n~ '?/*zS^ ■“ For the use of Officers in Her Majesty's Service only.

I have the honour to transmit herewith to your Lordship copy of a etter which I have received from Lieutenant-Colonel Picot, Acting ... eU ^ cl ^ ecre ^ ar ) i n Her Majesty s Legation, inclosing a manuscript of biographical Notices of Members of the Royal Family, Notables, Merchants and Clergy of Persia, which he has compiled during the past twelve months with infinite care and trouble. Some of the principal features of this work are that genealogical trees ol the Royal Family of Persia are given, showing the descent of its various members from Path Ah Shah, while, in addition to biographical notes of personages of the highest rank and importance in Persia, a short-history of some of the best known families is also given. Similarly with the tribes, a short history, with details of their various branches, sections, &amp;c., is gi\en, and much other matter which has not yet appeared in previous publications. Ibis document, when printed, will undoubtedly prove of inestimable value and utility to Her Majesty’s Legation and to members of Her Majesty’s Consular Service in Persia, while now that it has been once compiled it will be a comparatively easy matter to keep it up to date. I venture to express the opinion that great credit is due to Lieutenant- Colonel Picot, for the care and labour which, upon his own initiative, he has bestowed upon this work, and for the order and method with which he has succeeded in putting together the biographical sketches contained therein.

AIN ED DOWLEH, SULTAN MAJID MIRZA— Son of Azud ed Dowleh, Muchul Mirza (q.v.). Married a daughter of the Valiahd (present Shah) at Tabriz, with whom he held high appointments for some years. In 1896 was appointed governor of Mazanderan ; came to Teheran in 1897 without the Shah’s permission ; was sent to Kerbela, but returned in September of the same year and was pardoned. Age about 50; is Amir Tuman. Note. — January, 1898. Has, since above was written, been appointed chief of royal studs, stables, carriage department, etc. 2. AZUD ED DOWLEH, SULTAN AHMAD MIRZA, COM MONLY KNOWN AS MUCHUL MIRZA— Son of Fath Ali Shah by Taj ed Dowleh, and was born 1819. Has been governor of Hamadan and other small provinces. His three sons are Ain ed Dowleh, Sultan Majid Mirza, Amir Khan Sardar, l aji Ullah Mirza, and Saif ed Dowleh, Sultan Muhammad Mirza. His daughter, Shams ed Dowleh, was married to the late Shah. Age 78. 3. AZUD-ES-SULTAN, ABU’L FAZL MIRZA— Born 1883. Son of the present Shah. Age 14. 4. BAHA ED DOWLEH, HAJJI SASSAN MIRZA— Son of Baha ed Dowleh, Bahman Mirza, (b. 1811, d. 1861), who was a son of Fath Ali Shah. Was tutor to Muin ed din Mirza (born 1850, and declared Valiahd, but died 1856), and to Jellal ed Dowleh, Sultan Husain Mirza (born 1852, died 1868), both sons of the late Nassir ed Din Shah. Holds no official appointment. Age 65 ; is Amir i Tuman. 5. BURHAN EL MULK, NAWAB KHUSRO MIRZA— Grandson of Fath Ali Shah, and brother of Saham el Mulk (q.v.). Holds large landed property in Khorassan. In 1888 he was deputy governor of Khaf for his brother. Age 50.26 TEHERAN—ROYAL FAMILY. C. FATH ES SALTANEH, FATH ULLAH MIKZA— Son of Nayar ed Dowleh (q.v.). Is the present governor of Nishapur. His grandfather, Parviz Mirza, a son of Fath Ali Shall, was appointed governor of Nishapur in 1857, and when the late Nassir ed Din Shah passed through Nishapur on Ids way to Meshed in 1867, he conferred the title of Nayar ed Dowleh upon him. On his death, his son, Sultan Husain Mirza, succeeded to the title and the governorship, which he held until 1896. The Nayar ed Dowleh was appointed governor of Teheran at the beginning of 1897, and his son, Fath es Saltaneh, who was, at the time, acting governor of Nishapur was confirmed as governor. Although Nishapur is in Khorassan, it is not under the governor general of that Province, who exercised only nominal authority in revenue matters, because the revenue had to be paid and accounted for to him. The Nayar ed Dowleh has, however, put a stop to this also, by getting the revenue allotted for the salaries of the Teheran police. The governor of Nishapur is therefore quite independent of the governor-general of Khorassan. Age 27. 7. FIRMAN FIRM A, SALAR-I-LASHKAR, ABDUL HUSAIN MIRZA— The second son of the late Nusrat-ed-Dowleh, Firuz Mirza, and succeeded to the title on his father’s death in 1885. Received the title of Firman Firma on his elder brother’s (Nassir ed Dowleh, governor of Kerman) death in 1892. The following genealogical tree shows his descent from Fath Ali Shah and his relationship to the present Shah, Muzaffar-ed-Din :— I Muhammad Shah. , . I . Nassir-ed-Din Shah. Muzaffar-ed-Din Shah.

He was educated as an officer and received a fair military training in the Austrian Corps which he joined in 1880. Went to Tabriz as commander of the troops of Azerbaijan about 1886-87. On the death of his elder brother, became governor of Kerman, OTEHERAN—ROYAL FAMILY. 27 where he has, with the exception of short intervals, remained from 1891 to 1896. Has served for a short time as the Yaliahd’s (Muzaffar-ed-Din) deputy in Luristan. On the accession of Muzaffar-ed-Din Shah, lie threw himself into the opposition against the Sadr Azam (Amin-es-Sultan), and succeeded in bringing about his fall. Was appointed minister for war, 24 November, 1896, resigned September, 1897. Appointed governor-general of Fars and the Gulf Ports in October, 1897; as governor of the Ports, he farms their customs. Has great influence over Muzaffar-ed-Din Shah, whose daughter, the Umm-el-Khakan, he married. This marriage brings him into close relationship with the present Yaliahd who is a son of the Umm-el-Khakan’s mother. The Firman Firma is also connected with the Shah through his sister Hazrat Ulia, who is now the Shah’s favourite wife. Is a man of much energy, but wanting in judgment and tact. Is credited with possessing great wealth in landed property and investments in Europe. Age 40 ; speaks French. 8.

The chief of the tribe is the Ilkhani, and his deputy is the Ilbeggi; the former generally resides in Shiraz as hostage for the good behaviour of the tribe, while the latter is with the tribe. The last Ilkhani was Darab Khan (b. 1829), son of Mustafa Kuli Khan, Sardar of the Shahilu branch. His ancestor Ismail Khan (son of Jani Aka, son of Hamdar Aka, son of Muhammad Aka, son of Safar Ali Aka, son of Jani Aka, son of Kazi Aka, son of Amir Kazi, who flourished in the beginning of the sixteenth century) and his brother Hassan Khan were much trusted by Kerrim Khan Zend, and were chiefs of the tribe, but Kerrim Khan’s successors blinded Ismail Khan and cut Hassan Khan’s hands off. After the death of Ismail Khan, his son, Jani Khan became Ilbeggi, and in 1819 was made Ilkhani. He died in 1824 and was succeeded as Ilkhani by his second son, Muhammad Ali Khan (b. 1793), who died in 1851. Muhammad Ali Khan had married a daughter of Firman Firma Husain Ali Mirza in 1826, and left three sons by other wives, viz., (a) Jahangir Khan (b. 1815), Ilbeggi, who married a sister of Muhammad Shah and was commander (Sertip) of the Kashkai Infantry Regiment until 1849, when he was appointed governor of Darab. In 1851, on his father’s death, he became Ilbeggi and was appointed governor of Kazerun. He died in 1871. His son Muhammad Hassan Khan was Serhang of the Kashkai Infantry, and some time governor of Abadeh, and lately governor of Bonat. The second son was Lutf Ali Khan, who was Sertip of the Kashkai regiment from 1851 until his death in 1856, and left a son— Hajji Muhammad SadiJc Khan, now living in Abadeh. His third son, Hajji Nasr Ullah Khan (b. 1840), was Sertip of Kashkai regiment from 1856 to 1878, when he became Ilbeggi and governor of Kamfiruz and Chahar-dangeh. He died some years ago and left a son, Sultan Ibrahim Khan Sarhang (b. 1870). The eldest son of Jani Khan Ilkhani was Hajji Husain Kuli Khan, who, of a quiet disposition, was thought to be incapable of succeeding his father as Ilkhani, and settled in Kamfiruz, whereFARS. 83 three of his grandsons—Abbas Khan, Ali Akbar Khan, and Bakir Khan—are now living. The third son of Jani Khan Ilkhani was Murteza Kuli Khan Ilbeggi; he died in 1833 of a wound which he received in an engagement with government troops sent out to seize him. He left two sons, Ali Kuli Khan and Kobad Khan. Ali Kuli Khan was born in 1815, appointed Ilbeggi in 1871, and died not long ago. He left four sons : Allah Kuli Khan, Kuhandil Khan, Aman Ullah Khan, and Habbib Ullah Khan, who are now living. Kobad Khan died some years ago. He left one son, Imam Kuli Khan, now living. The fourth son of Jani Khan Ilbeggi was Mustafa Kuli Khan Sardar, who was killed at the siege of Kerman in 1831. He left two sons: one Sohrab Khan, who was executed in 1874, and left a son, Bahadur Khan, now living; the other, Darab Khan (b. 1829), the late Ilkhani, who died a short time ago, had three sons, all now living : Abdullah Khan, present Ilbeggi, Ahmad Khan, and Ismail Khan. The fifth son of Jani Khan Ilkhani was Muhammad Kuli Khan (b. 1809), who became Ilbeggi in 1835 and Ilkhani in 1851, and died 1867. He had one son, Sultan Muhammad Khan, who became Ilkhani in 1867, resigned in 1871, and has, several times since then, held the governorships of Ferrashband and Firuzabad. Up to twenty years ago the Ilkhanis of the Kashkais were very wealthy; since then much of their property has been sold or mortgaged, and they have many debts. The following are the sixty-six branches of the Kashkai tribe:— Urdakpai, Abu’l Hassani, Ukhchulu, Ukhchahpul, Arda- shiri, Aslani, Afshar i Kermani, Amirlu, Uriat, Irakllu, Ikdir, Inaklu, Ayublu, Papati, Baranikurdlu, Ballu, Balilahvand, Pagir, Bayat, Tulli, Chahardah- charik, Jamahbuzurgi, Chittiz, Jarkani, Jafarbeglu, Jafarbegi, Chigini, Khalaj, Dadahkah, Derrehshuri, Kahimi, Zengeneh, Sarui, Sahmdini, Shahulu, Shesh- buluki, Safikhani, Tayyibi, Alibeglu, Alikurdlu, Amalah, Farsimadan, Fili, Karacheh, Kobadlu, Karachallu, Karaghanlu, Kutulu, Kuehehbeglu, Kai, Karrai, Kermanlu, Kashkuli, Gellehzan, Kahku, Kahuvah, Mai Ahmadi, Muhammad Zamanlu, Margmari, Moghanlu, Moghani, Mosillu, Nimadi, Vanda, Yalmah. 22.

He is the great enemy of the Babis, and has caused many poor men to be killed. In 1889-90, he had a number of Sehdehis killed, although they were under the protection of government troops. For this, at the instance of Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister, ho was brought to Teheran, but was treated with so much honour, that when he returned to Ispahan his fame and power were largely increased. He and his brothers have more than once interfered with British merchants, to the latter’s detriment. They also twice caused European goods to be boycotted in the bazars of Ispahan. They are in close alliance with Hajji Mirza Ashtiani,of Teheran, and are fair representatives of the fanatical party of Persia. They have lately given much trouble to the British Legation at Teheran, owing to their persecutions of the Jews.

MERCHANTS OF ISPAHAN— In the following notes, the sum after the name is the amount the person is reputed to be worth. It is quite impossible to be at all certain of the accuracy of such estimates, which may be safely discounted to a greater or a less extent in all cases. All the Ispahan merchants, with perhaps a few exceptions, are willing to trade in anything in which they fancy they see a profit; and where articles are mentioned in connection with any merchant, they are those in which he mainly trades, and it must not be supposed that he devotes himself exclusively to them. 1.

Age 50. 12 BALUCH TRIBE OF KHORASSAN— A large number of families of this tribe are said to have been brought from Baluchistan to Sistan by Mahmud of Ghazni, from whence they were moved to Khorassan by Kherim Khan Zend. They number about three thousand families at present, and are scattered in the Nishapur, Sabzavar, Turbat i Haidari, Turshiz, Tabas, Jam, Bakharz and Khaf districts. Besides these there are several thousand families still in the Sistan and Kain districts.

HAJJI MIRZA IIASSAN AFSHAR, YEZDI— One of the principal merchants of Meshed. Age 50. 15. HAZARA TRIBE OF KHORASSAFT— After the last siege of Herat the Persian commander, Hissam es Saltaneh, governor-general of Khorassan, brought about 5,000 families of this tribe from Kala Nan, in the Herat district, to Khorassan. They were allotted lands in the Jam and Bakharz districts, and their chief, Yusuf Khan, was given the rank and pay of a Sartip, with a service of Hazara Sowars. After a short time about 2,000 families returned to Kala Nau, and the Persian government did not consider it advisable to leave the remaining families on the frontier. They, therefore, moved them to Isfarain, where they remained some years. From Isfarain they were moved to Kana Gusha, a village near Meshed. In 1877 Yusuf Khan was appointed governor of Bakharz, where he built the village of Muhsinabad, on the Herat frontier, and settled a number of the families there. His son, Ismail Khan, remained with a number of the families at Kana Gusha. Yusuf Khan died in 1885, and was succeeded by his son, Ismail Khan, Shuja el Mulk (q.v.). The Hazaras in Khorassan now number about 1,200 families, who live in Kana Gusha, Kanabist, Kalta Chanar, and Muhsinabad, in the Meshed and Bakharz districts. There are some families in the Zorabad district also. They all are Sunnis. 16. HISHMAT EL MULK, MIR ALI AKBAR KHAN— Is the present chief of Sistan, and was governor of Tabas. He succeeded his father (who was chief of both Sistan and Kain) in 1891, Ka'in being given over to his younger brother Shaukat el Mulk. He had the governorship of Tabas in 1896, but was dismissed 1897. The government of Tabas was for a long time held by the members of the family of Mir Hassan Khan, Vakil i Tabas. He was of Arab origin, of the tribe of Ibn i Sharban, said to have been brought to Tabas from Arobia by one of the Safavian kings. The'73 &lt; &gt; K HOE ASS AN. 95 chiefs of the tribe were formerly independent and only nominally under the Shah of Persia, but they gradually lost their power. The government of the district, however, remained hereditary till quite recently. The Vakil of Tabas was succeeded by Hajji Muhammad Bakir Khan, who was granted the title of Imad el Mulk by Nassir ed Din Shah during his first journey to Khorassan in 1867. The Imad el Mulk died in 1894, 77 years of age, and left three sons : Ali Akbar Khan, Muhammad lieza Khan, and Abu l Kassim Khan. On the Imad el Mulk’s death, his eldest son, Ali Akbar Khan, succeeded to his father’s title and to the government of Tabas. The second son became Imad i Diwan, and the third son was granted the title of Main i Diwan, and they were both appointed deputy governors of districts under their elder brother. The Imad el Mulk soon lost the governorship owing to his own incompetence and to the intrigues of his brotheis, who persuaded the priests to denounce him as a Babi. He was thereupon summoned to Teheran, and the Imad i Diwan succeeded him. He did not retain his post for long, and w T as dismissed in 1896, when the district of Tabas was added to the government of the Hishmat el Mulk. On the Bukn ed Dowleh’s arrival in Meshed in autumn 1897, Hishmat el Mulk was deprived of the governorship of Tabas, which was given to the Imad i Diwan. This, however, was not confirmed by the Prime Minister, who on obtaining a present from the eldest brother, Imad el Mulk, ordered him to be reinstated. In consequence the Imad el Mulk now holds the government of Tabas. In order to compensate the second son, his title was raised from Imad i Diwan to Imad el Mamalik. These three brothers must now be very near the end of their resources, and when they have no more money their ruin will be complete, and probably a generation hence their descendants w ill be occupying a position little removed from that of an ordinary peasant. . .. As the Hishmat el Mulk has large resources, in all probability he will eventually oust them from Tabas entirely and get its government for himself. The Hishmat el Mulk has two sons. The eldest, Mir Masum Khdn Sartip, 17 years of age, is deputy governor of Sistan. His mother is a daughter of Sherif Khan Sardar, chief of Nahroes, who occupied a prominent position in Sistan politics aftei the boundaiy arbitration was finished, and afterwards went over to the Afghans, and died at Kabul some eight years ago.

HAJJI ISMAIL— Architect in charge of the shrine buildings at Meshed, and general building contractor. Age 30. 19. JAMSHIDI TRIBE OF KHORASSAN— During the reign of Shah Kaniran, the Jamshidi tribe numbered about 12,000 families and were settled, under their chief Zaman Khan, son of Karah Khan, in the Badghis district of Herat. Zaman Khan s cousins, Mir Ahmad Khan, Abdullah Khan and Mehdi Kuli Khan (sons of Jabbar Khan, son of Mahmud Khan), who were also Jamshidi Khans, were inimical to him. From Badghis the tribe migrated to Merv and afterwards to Urganj ; about 2,000 families, however, remained and settled at Kurrukh, and Khan Hazrat, the Amir of Urganj, appointed Mir Ahmad Khan as chief of the tribe settled in that district. Abdullah Khan was appointed chief of the Jamshidis in Herat, but he tied to Maimenah, whereupon Allahyar Khan, son of Zaman Khan, took his position. About this time disputes arose between the Urganj and Aamut tribes, and during these disputes Mir Ahmad Khan was killed. The Khan of Urganj then appointed Mehdi Kuli Khan chief of the Jamshidis, and conferred upon him the title of Khan Aka. During the disturbances in Urganj, Mehdi Khan, who was anxious to return to his former residence, escaped and went to Andkhui. Herat was, at this time, being besieged by the Persians under Hisam es Saltaneh, Sultan Murad Mirza, who, acting under the orders of his government, persuaded 2,000 families of Jamshidis to migrate to Khorassan, under their chief Allahyar Khan, and settled them in the Sar i Jam district. After Hisam es Saltaneh’s return from Herat, the Jamshidi families in Andkhui came back to Herat and settled in Badghis, under their chief Mehdi Kuli Khan, Khan Aka, who was after wards murdered by Sardar Ayub Khan at Herat. His son Aalangtush Khan, who succeeded him, was killed by Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. The Jamshidis who had migrated to Khorassan remained in Sar i Jam for six months, but, as the Turkomans frequently raided that district, they migrated to Kanagushah and Karrabukhah, near Meshed, whence a large number of the families were sent back to Herat by their chiei : and on this beeominsrKHORASSAN'. 97 known to the Persian authorities, Allahyar Khan, the chief, fled to Herat. On his flight, the remaining families were placed under the Paoti chief Ismail Khan. The Jamshidis were then moved to Kushkhaneh, in the Kuchan district, where they remained for a few years with the Paoti families. Afterwards they were brought back to Kanagushah and Karrabukhah. In the meantime Allah- 3.11 Klrnn, being displeased with the treatment he received at Herat from Sardar Yakub Khan, fled to Meshed, and became chief of the Jamshidis in Khorassan. They then numbered about 300 families, but this number was subsequently reduced to 150 by a famine which occurred in Khorassan. Allahyar Khan died at Karrabukhah and was succeeded as chief by his son Zulfikar Khan. In 1885, half of the Jamshidis were sent to Paskamar, and the rest joined them three years after wards. At this time they only numbered about 80 families, which is their present strength. In 1889 Zulfikar Khan opened negotiations with the Russians, whereupon he and the tribe were sent back to Karrabukhah. He then fled to Russian territory, and his younger brother Muhammad Azim Khan was made chief. The tribe is now settled in Jellala- bad and Jiza Abad, near Shahan i Garmab, about ten farsakhs from Meshed. Zulfikar Khan returned to Meshed, and settled at Shurja, near Paskamar, where he lives at present. He is about 40 years of age, and, with his brothers, receives a pension.

Belongs to an old family of Arabs. The present generation is the eighth in descent from the founder of the family, Mir Ali Khan, of the Arab tribe of Khuzaima, which is said to have been forced to emigrate from Arabia to Khorassan in the time, of Khalifa Harun el Rashid, in the beginning of the ninth century, and was settled in the Kain district as a check on the turbulent natives of that district. The tribe remained wealthy flock-owners, and gradually increased in power till Mir Ali Khan, their chief, became Amir of Kain about the seventeenth centuiy. His son, Mir Masum Khan, is said to have been in Nadir Shah s service, and his grandson, Mir Alam Khan, is said to have been the man who deprived Shah Rukh, grandson of Nadir Shah, of his. eye- fi-ht at Meshed in 1748. In the disturbances that subsequently O108 KIIORASSA.N. ensued, Mir Alam Khan gained power and proclaimed himself Amir of Khorassan, but was forced to leave the country by Ahmad Shah Abdali. It is said that he was succeeded as Amir of Kain by Mir Ismail Khan, and the latter by Mir Alam Khan II, the grand father of Mir Alam Khan III, Hishmat el Mulk, father of the present chief of Kain, and of the present chief of Sistan and Tabas, who died in Meshed in 1891.

Age 65.KHORASSAN. 109 54 TIMURI TRIBE OF KHORASSAN— The Timuris are said by some to be of Tartar origin, but this is not certain, as they have neither a tribal history nor the distinctive Tartar features. It is, however, beyond doubt that they originally came to these parts from Syria, and therefore they may be Arabs. About 20,000 families of these people are said to have been moved from Syria to Turkistan by Amir Timur, hence their name. Amir Timur settled them in the Balkh district, which he gave them, as a dowry to his daughter, who was married to Mir Sayyid Kalal, a saint of Arab descent living on the banks of the Oxus, who was Amir Timur’s spiritual guide. On Mir Sayyid Kalal’s death, the tribe was distributed among his sons. One of these sons, Sayyid Mir Shahid (also called Mir Shah Khan), got about four thousand families and removed them from Balkh to the Herat district. He was very considerate and kind to his people, and his amiable qualities attracted the majority of the families remaining in Balkh, who also joined him and settled in the Herat district. When Muhammad Shah Kajar besieged Herat in 1838, he moved about eight thousand families to Khorassan under their chief, Kilich Khan, a great-grandson of Mir Sayyid Kalal, who gained great power and became the ruling chief of the districts of Jam, Bakharz, Khaf, and Zorabad, with the title of amir. About two thousand families of Timuris are said to be still in the Herat, Sabzawar and Farah districts of Afghanistan. The Timuris of Khorassan number some six thousand families.

ZAFEANLU TRIBE OF KURDS OF KHORASSAN— This tribe, which numbers about 40,000 families, was brought originally to Khorassan by Shah Abbas Safari from the west of Persia in 1600. Muhammad Nassir Khan, Shuja ed Dowleh (q.v.), is its sixth chief. A section of this tribe is settled in the district of Chenaran, and numbers about 800 families. The district was founded by this tribe after the expulsion of the Kurds from the Atak ; but it played a subordinate part in the history of the frontier until the time of Mamesh Khan. This chief raised himself from a petty vassal to an independent ruler in Khorassan, and for nearly 40 years, during Fath Ali Shah’s reign, was very unsubmissive. The possessions of this section extended up the Meshed valley as far as Kuchan, and down to Gunabad, 20 miles from Meshed. After Mamesh Khan’s death, his family gradually lost its influence and position.
