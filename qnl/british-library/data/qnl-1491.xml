I askod what the point was and ne replied (a) that they found American personnel unsatisfaccory In eastern waters end would propose to uso an American Jiaster and perhaps Chief Engineer and have the rest of the ship's company Asiatics, and (b) that If repairs are done to e ship under t.v &gt;e American » Flag at a foreign port the Company have to oay to the American Government a fine oi 50^ of the amount spent on repairs (unless the repairs ure necessitated by stress of weather). He added that It might please the Slaaikh# 5. The ininediate object of the Company on both points se« ms to be to srve money and it is possible to register the ship In Bahrain Just as chov.s arc- registered. I en not, however, qualified to express an opinion on so technical a proposal, but the following points occur to met-2. 4. -- said that the question ifcas one which I could not answer, but th*j t i wouxd consult His Excellency the Biaval ^oauaander -in-Chiel ana suhalt the matter to you.

The iionourable Lieutenant-Colonel T.C.Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush? re•On the evening of the 11th Jan.1935 Captain Smith com manding the Standard Oil Tanicship 'W. S. Rheems' called on me for a few minutes. He asKed if he could put something to me quite informally - what was my feeling about a proposal which his head office had in mind : to detach a tan^ship from their fleet and put her under the Bahrain flag. I asked what the point was and he cxplained that they did not find American crews satisfactory on eastern runs and v/ished to employ a lascar or other Asiatic crew. They apparently could not do this under the U.S.flag. Also there would ue a great saving of money over thee rew,and also over repairs (as an U.S. ship repaired abuiuad has t to pay 50% of the cost of any such repairs to the U.S. G-ovt. on ner return). I said that it was rather a big question to spring on me and that I had no idea off hand what the international implications would be. I jiielxiiaixxKExaayx said that if he had no objection , I would taKe the opportunity of consulting expert opinion when the Naval G-in-G and 3.H.O. came , as the matter was rather beyond me. He said he would be glad if I would and that perhaps we could talk about it again on his return in seven or eight wee^cs. I see 'snags' possibly , in the Persian attitude, in the fact that Bahrain has no shippinglaws so that ship registered here would have to observe no Plimsoll line or other such regulations, ov er the nationality of of tne crew and one or two other petty considerations. But I thinKoff-hand that it wo i^d be ^.uite welcome to the Shaikh and would m a sense give American snaction to the independence of Bahrain.
