She tells of being part of the small population of female students at AUC at the time, and the significant role of extracurricular activities like drama and sports, and the benefits of discussions and other interactions with American faculty members outside of class.  She credits her volunteer work with farmers in rural areas during the war as influencing her career. After teaching at Cairo School for Girls from 1942 to 1944, she continued her studies at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania in the United States, later going on to serve as a United Nations official, as did other AUC graduates like Aziza Hussein.  (Her name is also spelled Aida Guindi).</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
