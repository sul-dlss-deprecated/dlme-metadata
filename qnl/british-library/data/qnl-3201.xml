W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(tteceived October 2, 5'45 p.m.) Sir Tehran, October 2, 1914. (No. 291.) SIR G. (October 2, 10’30 a.m.) BUCHANAN’S telegram No. 448 of 24th September. None of the maliat of Azerbaijan has been paid into the Imperial Bank of Persia since Shuster left, and only a small portion of that of Resht I understand that the Persian Government have proposed scheme in connection with a plan for abolition of the collection of taxes by the Russian consuls, under which half of the maliat of Tabriz and certain other towns of the north would be paid through the Russian Bank and half through other banks which are not specified. As the Russian Minister jumped to the conclusion that the Imperial Bank of Persia was meant, it is probably to this last the Russian Minister for 4 oreign Alfairs referred. Prime Minister is most anxious not to give an undertaking that all the maliat in the Russian zone shall be paid through the Russian Bank because he does not wish to accentuate line of zone of demarcation. . . In my opinion, to accept such an arrangement would be a distinct infringement of the right of the Imperial Bank of Persia, but, as it is most desirable in the interests of all parties that a friendly arrangement should be reached, it would appear to me reasonable that the maliat of the five northern provinces, where Russian influence is paramount, be paid through the Russian Bank and that of the remainder of the provinces in Russian zone, where British interests are considerable, through the two banks equally. The 100,000£. loan secured on northern revenues made to Persian Government by the Imperial Bank of Persia in 1913 would, of course, have to be paid off before any such agreement could come into force. A scheme has been proposed under which Russian Bank would advance 1,000,000 tomans to pay off this loan, leaving 400,000 tomans in the hands of the Persian Government, and Russian Minister tells me he has asked Russian consuls to supply figures of the maliat collected, and asserts that he is ready to hand over money to the Persian Government at once. He says that if an agreement is made respecting the maliat he will at once instruct Russian consuls to cease its collection, and all that will be required will be that the financial agents shall keep Russian consuls informed of the deposit of the maliat due from each Russian subject. He says that undertaking would be given that all money would be paid in to the Persian Government and none deducted by bank to meet its own claims against the Government and private individuals, as was done in the past. I have spoken in the sense of third paragraph to my Russian colleague and to Persian Government. (Repeated to Petrograd.) [1002-117]CONFIDENTIAL h r 1 Vr '* V Sir G.

X7 SEP1914[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] r PERSIA. 5896 -^' 250 CONFIDENTIAL. _ Section 1. Q Ut. .43056] No. 1. (No. 244.) Sir, Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 25.) St. Petersburgh, August 16, 1914. ^ I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith translation of a communication which I have received from the Russian Government in reply to the aide-memoire demand put forward by the Russian Government for the dismissal of Samsam-es- Sultaneh from the post of Governor-General of Ispahan. THE Imperial Minister at Tehran was, in fact, instructed to demand the recall from Ispahan of Samsam-es-Sultaneh, the local Governor-General, and the Government to this effect, and to request that steps taken in this respect by M., Korostovets might be supported by their representative in Tehran. The motive which induced the Imperial Government to take this decision is the openly hostile attitude of Samsam-es-Sultaneh to everything Russian, and his provoca tive conduct towards the Imperial consulate in Ispahan. In his efforts to undermine the interests of Russian subjects in the province entrusted to him, he has taken under his special protection the well-known German protege and adventurer, Dr. Pugen, who has been endeavouring by the leasing of land to create extensive German interests in this part of Persia. Further, by raids on properties leased by the Russian subject, Karapetof, and others, as also by the groundless arrest of the peasants on these estates, he is inflicting heavy losses on those Russian subjects. Finally, he systematically refuses to deal with any law suits of Russian subjects. In particular, in the case of the purchase by the Russian subject, Mekhdief, of the harvest crop on the “ wakuf ” estate, Melavedjir, Samsam-es-Sultaneh gave orders for the harvesting of this crop by Government “ mamurs,” and when the Ministry for the Interior instructed him to deal with this case conjointly with the Russian consul, he refused to do so, and declared that “ the Government of the Shah evidently did not know that the interests of a Russian subject were involved.” The Imperial Government have grounds for fearing that this state of affairs may finally lead to measures of self-defence on the part of Russian subjects not finding actual protection and support of their lawful claims in the consulate. The result ^ of this would be sanguinary collisions between the people and the Administration, which would be especially dangerous and undesirable at the present time. The Imperial Government see no other way, therefore, out of the situation than the removal of Samsam-es-Sultaneh and his replacement by another. The Imperial Government, at the same time, consider it necessary to mention that they do not in the least cherish auy unfriendly feelings towards the Bakhtiaris in general. In particular, the rumoured intention of the Russian consul to purchase Sardar Jang or Sardar Ashd, who, it is alleged, have been offered a bribe of 30,000 tomans, has already been categorically denied by M. Preobrajensky, who, it may be stated, has no such means at his disposal. The Imperial Government cannot but note with regret that the activity of Russian subjects in Ispahan, which is, however, within the Russian sphere of influence, is which I addressed to the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram No. 472 of the 9th instant regarding the I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. of the Shah were informed that they would be held responsible for losses which might be incurred by Russian subjects through actions of the above-named Persian official. The Imperial Ambassador in London was instructed to notify the British Government viewed apparently with certain ala [2228 bb—l] by tUF British Missies in Tehran, which affirmsthat this activity will be detrimental to British interests. The Imperial Ministry have already instructed M. Korostovets to discuss this matter with Sir W. Townley in order to ascertain precisely the wishes of the British Government, and to endeavour to find a compromise equally guaranteeing the interests of both parties. It is very desirable that similar instructions be given to Sir W. Townley. St. Petersburgh, Juhj 31 (August 13), 1914. M From a telegram just received from the Russian Minister at Tehran, the Imperial Ministry learn with gratification that Sir W. Townley, in meeting the wishes of the Imperial mission, has expressed his readiness to advise Samsam-es-Sultanteh to give in his resignation. The Imperial Government consider it their duty in this respect to convey their sincere appreciation to the British Government. St. Petersburgh, July 31 (August 13), 1914.

At an opportune moment your Excellency should inform Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs of report that has reached His Majesty’s Government regarding Xaib Hussein, and state that, in view of Russia’s recent assurances regarding the abuse of protection, His Majesty’s Government feel confident that a notorious brigand who before now has flouted Russian authority will not receive such a favour. Your Excellency should at the same time enquire views of Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the financial outlook, and see whether his Excellency would view favourably the retention of the gendarmerie in its present state until the end of the war. Such an act could not fail to impress favourably the Persian Government.4 CONFIDENTIAL. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 11, 2*30 a.m.) Tehran, September 10, 1914. (No. 258.) (September 10, 9'30 p.m.) OFFICER commanding gendarmerie announced three days ago that the disbanding of the 1st and 2nd regiments (Tehran and Kum districts) would commence 12th September, as no funds to pay men were available. Danger has been averted temporarily, but it is hard to see how the future calls are to be met. It would be a disaster for us if the gendarmerie were to be disbanded at the present moment. In consequence of war trade with the north is at a standstill, and there is a fair chance of our recovering our lost ground if the roads can be kept open from the south. Tehran houses are already making preparations to order from India. We have money enough to keep Fars and Kerman going for a few months, but the danger zone is between Ispahan and Tehran, on which road Naib Hussein is beginning to make himself felt again. There are persistent rumours that Russians are about to give this arch-onender protection for himself and his property. Russian Legation returns evasive answers, but manager of Russian Bank at Ispahan has owned to the acting British consul-general that the matter is being negotiated. Persian Government has advised Russian Legation that it could not recognise Russian protection over these properties, which are stolen, and do not therefore legally belong to outlaw or his sons. It would, in my opinion, be greatly to our interest if we could guarantee upkeep of gendarmerie on its present footing until the end of the war, in order to maintain through communication between Tehran and the Gulf. 1 931—608, CONFIDENTIAL.

VYT-V-TT * Not printed. [2251 h—‘S] Copy to India 16 OCT 1914.9/B8 of 1914 CAM? ISPAHAN, July 18th, 1914. Sir:- 1 have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the new Russian Consul in Isfahan, throueh Haji tuha-mad Ibrahim, the rtussian Agent, has commenced to make overtures to Kafi-ul-Uamalek, the Isfahan agent and representative of the Sardar-i-Jang. A few days ago Haji Muhammad I brahim, accompanied by a local J ullah Vno. n. a- L'ullah i Daulatabadi, went to the eardar-i-Jang 1 s agent and after the usual preliminaries got to business. Vafi-ul-I'amalek is by birth a Khorassani and lias estates in furbat-x- Laidari. The Russian offer was that Kafi-ui-inmaiek should inform the Russian Consul of the name of his estate agent in Yurbat, tuat it should be arranged to pay this .flan 30 Tomans per mensem pro form, end under cover of being a Russian employ4 , be granted Russian protection for his person and property, and of course for the Kafi-ul- Sir W. Townley, K.C J .G-., do.Msumlek'B property also. further that they would extend Russian protection to Kafi -ul-Mamalek, should he desiro it. This was the bait to catch the unwary Kafi. Nov/ what did they want out of him? Their object was twofold, firstly to enlist his sympathies and assistance in drawing the oardar-i-Jang into the Russian net, and secondly to enlist his, and through him, his ii&amp;ster's assistance by playing on the enmity existing between them and the Samsam us Sultaneh, with a view to secure the latter* s dismissal from the Ispahan Governorship. They held out also a bait to the ;&gt;ardar i Jang. Being aware of the arrangement whereby 50% of the makings of the Ispahan Governorship ore payable to Jardar i Jang, and also that these moneys have not yet been paid and that some difficulty is being experienced in obtaining payment, they offered to pay caah dowa '30,000 ts or what ever sun the half share caae to* to the Sardar i Jang or his agent and the latter’s own personal allowance also, ar the price of Ms assistance in ejecting the damcar. us Sultaneh© II Sultaneh and replacing Mm by a creature of the Russians. The Russian a^ent has been very active in getting together a party to work against oamsam, and secure by some means or other his ejection. Up to the present the influential persons of tMs clique are the Agent himself, Soyid ul Iraquain, mullah i Daulatabadi , Akhund i Kalbaai , Shej kh lluhamned Baqir, the youngest son of the late Agha Jajafi, and the Reis i Nazmieh of Ispahan. One of the hullahs, .\ha is not of tMs party, conveyed to the Samsam a secret warning on the occasion when he went to the 1’asjid i Shah, in connexion with the obsequies of the late Agha Najafi, to be on Ms guard against the intrigues of this party. The Kafi ul liamalek is not unwilling to listen to these blandishments, as is evidenced by his biassed award in the case of a money claim by the late Reis i Nasndeh - now Russian Munshibashi - against the Governor General; in wMch case Kafi ul I.amalek was appointed one of two arbitrators, his confrbra being tho Lirza of Samsam-us- Sultaneh, Governor General of Isfahan. I do not tMnk the Sardar-i-Jang is very likely to fallII 0 &amp; fall into the Russian snare, though of course the money bait might tempt him, of Ids Agent I am not &amp;o certain. 1 shall ratch the situation and report further develop ments. Meanwhile to relieve Sardar-i-Jang’s most pressing immediate needs for money and keep him as far as possible out of the way of temptation I have been casting about and find there is still to Mo credit in the Imperial Bank of Isfahan, through an oversight the May instalment of the Oil Subsidy, for the payment of which I am making arrange ments. I have commnicated by telegraph v/ith the Sardar-i- Jang and shall inform Your Excellency on completion of the arrangement.

In reply, and without entering into a discussion as to how far abuses might be said to exist or not on the part of these subordinate collectors, I said that as far as the Belgian officials themselves were concerned the duty for which they had been appointed, viz., to account for and exercise control over such funds as were received on behalf of the State w r as, I had. always understood, being ^ efficiently performed by them and from this my colleague did not dissent. Now that these indirect taxes, I went on to say, had been handed over to the municipality there would, if the accounts which had been given to me of former methods of conducting Persian finance were correct, be very little real control at all, and I added that I could not myself see where the guarantees for the proper employment of the funds now obtained were to come from. The reply of M. Orlof on this point was not very clear, but I gathered from his concluding remarks that in case foreign subjects were asked to contribute to the cost of town improvements a certain control would be exercised by two of their representatives whom, he had reason to believe, the foreign consulates would be requested by the local authorities to appoint for that purpose.

(No. 239. Very Confidential.) [August 25, 3-15 p.m.) I HAA E had a long conversation with my Russian colleague upon situation. He j displayed a conciliatory spirit quite foreign to his previous attitude. If his assurances | were genuine, and he does not change his mind, much may yet be done towards re establishment ot a state of affairs less intolerable to Persian Government. Certain rich landed proprietors claiming Russian protection owe large sums of money representing unpaid taxes to Treasury. From fear of action that Russian Legation might take, these persons have never been energetically pressed to pay. Russian Minister assured me that such persons would never receive support from him, in their refusal to pav taxes and suggests that claims against Persian Government and their counter-claims against Russian Government should be examined by a commission on which the two legations would be represented. Idea appears to me to offer possible settlement of a grievance and would probably be acceptable to Government if B is Majesty’s Legation as well as Russian Legation is represented on commission. Sum involved is about 200,OOOZ. Russian Minister assured me that collection of taxes by Russian consul from Russian subjects and protected persons in Russian zone is a purely temporary measure, and will be handed back to Treasury officials as soon as an arrangement has been reached establishing an equitable basis of taxation for all. Meanwhile, accounts are kept, and Persian Government could be told in a fortnight if they sought the information how much has actually been collected. Russian Minister hinted that delivery of money might be made conditional upon wishes of Russia being met on certain points, presumably concessions granted, but he said he had no instructions. Such a condition, before paying over to Persia what is clearly her own, would seem to be a little unjust and arbitrary. He also said he was quite ready to co-operate in an arrangement under which provincial Governors should not be hindered in execution of their duties by restriction against interfering in villages owned or leased by Russians. This was with special reference to Ispahan. Russian Minister said he had no objection to Sardar Bahadur, but suggested that he should come here and talk over situation with us before taking up his post. He complained that his hands are much tied by M. Klein, who thinks that he knows much more about Persia than he (Russian Minister) does. |28 AUG 1914^' vV,0 - 2b v 72CONFIDENTIAL I'b'Tl Sir Edward (drey to Sir W. Townley (Tehran).

Samsam will resign at a word from me. I told my Pussian colleague that it appeared to me better that I should secure his resignation, if Ku&gt;sian Government was determined upon it, rather than that Russia should increase her unpopularity in Persia by demanding dismissal of a man who has occupied a post of Prime Minister, and whose chief fault is that he refuses to recognise unjustifiable contention of Russian officials that representatives of Governor-General have no right to penetrate into villages leased or administered by Russians. This holds good in neutral as well as in Russian zone, and makes it very hard to hold the Governor-General responsible for maintenance of order on the roads, the security of which is seriously threatened in district between Kashan and Ispahan. Samsam has not been very diplomatic in bis handling of very awkward question, which has been created solely by Russian methods, for which Zil-es-Sultaneh’s sons are in no small measure responsible. It is desirable, in the interests of peace on [?] Bakhtiari road and south of Ispahan, that a Bakhtiari should be for the present Governor-General of Ispahan, but I am doubtful whether Russians will agree to the appointment of anyone but a creature of their own.

In telling my Russian colleague what I had heard, I said I could not believe that story until 1 had more proof, but it served to show that policy pursued by Russia has created a belief that they would stick at nothing in order to damage British interests in Southern Persia.

Mornard had not mentioned the fact that the tax was to be collected by the Russian consulates. Though I assured M. Sazonof that my statement was founded on a memorandum which M. Mornard had himself drawn up for the use of the Persian Government, his Excellency disputed its accuracy and maintained that the suggestion that the land tax should be collected by the Russian consulates had been made originally by M. Mornard. As, however, his Excellency added that, as the collection of the land tax by the Russian consulates was now to be discontinued, the question had no longer any practical interest, I did not think it necessary to argue the point further.

YOUR telegram No. 153 of 14tla July. . . ^ Viceroy of India’s telegram of 11th June sums up situation in Southern Persia admirably, and puts forward a scheme for the protection of British interests with which, except in minor details, I am in complete accord, provided that His Majesty s Govern ment are of opinion that the moment has arrived when the Persian question should be treated from the British Indian standpoint only, but I ask myselt: Has that moment arrived ? Is it finally and conclusively proved that Persian independence and integrity can no longer be maintained, and that British intervention in the south on the lines of Viceroy’s telegram has become imperative ? In a word are we prepared to partition Persia?' For, disguise it as we may, that is inevitable tendency ol the measures proposed. The answer to this question is to be found in another query. Can His Majesty’s Government persuade Russian Government to so lar abandon their present policy in Persia as to return to status quo existing at the time ot the signature of convention of 1907 ? If the answer to this question is m the negative, and we know the answer before even the question is put, there would appeal to be no alternative but to adopt policy which must lead to partition sooner or later. Russia cannot withdraw from the position she has created for herself m the north Her subjects have acquired large landed interests impossible to abandon, unless Persia could buv them out. She cannot relinquish her claim to refuse 1 ersian authorities permission to enter villages bought or leased without an intolerable loss of pies ige. Further, regeneration of Persia depended, in my opinion, upon, the European- administered institutions. Attitude of Russia towards the gendarmerie and the Belgian financial administration has so discredited these institutions as to render their future utility more than problematical, unless they can be re-established m public esteem by some marked act of open support. _ . . . -i Therefore it would seem that the British Indian policy proposed is the only one to be adopted at the point we have now reached, but the less stress laid upon the integrity and independence of Persia the better. Even, however, after the sacrifice of that chimera, the 1907 convention seems to me to remain a working proposition, provided that the present areas can be maintained by an understanding between the Lo Governments as to what each can do in its own zone, and, above all, if the position of each in the neutral zone is absolutely and clearly defined. . 7 Vital British interests concerned demand that this zone m its almost entire^ should come under the preponderating influence of His Majesty s Dorermnant. Public opinion in Russia would probably never tolerate open avowal of this. It seems therefore essential that we gradually acquire tacit consent of Russia to protect 0111 own interests. This could probably best be done by putting British officers on trade routes in manner suggested in the Viceroy’s telegram in the place of bwedes, and by getting the various important tribal chiefs from Turkish fiontiei to erman o &lt; j foi 'TJropose^to' deal with the other points mentioned in India Office letter by despatch.Q^ almost appear as if we have now reached point where a semblance of Persian independence can alone be maintained by means of a loan with a commission of control.Immediate. and Cojifidential. \ -y 4 ^ O t &gt; c j t » &lt; i » : ; ; —f - The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India, and is directed by the Secretary of State to transmit the accompanying copies of Z. telegrams , as marked in the margin.

I HAD a long conversation this morning with my Russian colleague upon the subject of the Persian memorandum respecting the recent action of Russian consuls in Azerbaijan and elsewhere, which formed an enclosure in my despatch No. 182 of yesterday’s date. M. Korostovetz, with whom I had already exchanged views upon the subject yesterday afternoon, repeated what he had then said about the Persian Government making some proposals which would facilitate a settlement, instead of contenting itst with a bald statement of so-called grievances. I pointed out that it hardly appeared reasonable to expect the Persian Government to offer Russia an easy ^ ay out o a a se situation, for which they (the Persian Government) could not be held responsible, and I asked the Minister what he considered could have been put forward as a suggestion that would have facilitated a settlement. „ M. Korostovetz replied that it is necessary that there should be some sort ot control, and that it is essential to secure that the taxes collected from Russian subjects should be paid into the Russian Bank. He added that many Russians and Russian- protected persons complained that they were improperly taxed, and again urged that all that had been done had been done in consequence of a proposal made _ by the Treasurer-General. On my pressing the point, he seemed unable to substantiate his case very clearly, and took refuge behind the statement that he was not personal y responsible, as he had acted upon instructions received from St. Petersburgh a tei e had communicated M. Mornard’s proposal to his Government. I called my colleague’s attention to the tact that it is a habit of taxpayers to complain of the taxes they have to pay, and that the somewhat arbitrary method of imposing taxes in Persia furnished ample opportunity to the discontented, but as e if there was any reason to suppose that a Russian occupying one farm was more severely taxed than a Persian occupying the neighbouring one. If the Persian found that the Russian did not pay his taxes, he would probably not be slow to obtain that Russian protection, which could apparently be had for the asking which would exempt him also from paying his taxes. It was to put a stop to this abuse that M. Mornard had tried to make an arrangement with the Russian Legation, and had put torwarc a proposal which had been at once misconstrued and put in force without any answer o acceptance being returned. I argued that it was clear, and had hit lei o a waj/S een accepted, that clause 5 of the Treaty of Turcomanchai, by sanctioning the acquisition of dwelling-houses and business premises in towns, implied that Russian subjects had no right to possess landed property elsewhere. M. Poklewski, by constantly alluding to the necessity for a revision of this prohibition, had officially recognised its Granted, however, that Russians could possess such property, I could discover no reason why they should not pay the land tax upon the same like any other landowner in Persia, nor could I see why the Russian consul should meddle in the matter, 01 ' y the money collected must necessarily be paid into the Russian Bank Moreover said, both he and the Russian Government appeared to have overlooked the fact that the “ maliat ” of Azerbaijan and Nazanderam, in the latter of which provmces the Imperial Bank of Persia has no branch, has never been paid into the British Bank. I added that the action of the Russian Government appeared like an attempt to coerce the Persian financial administration into taking any legitimate banking business from this British institution, which was quite justified under its charter, made P™ to the 1907 understanding, in doing business throughout Persia, irrespective of zones or spheres ° f ”trkorostovetz here urged that all the banking advantages in Persia are on the side of the Imperial Bank, and th^t it was but fair to bring grist to the Russian mi [2192 u—2] 3XJUL1914 I Cap- 7 &lt; inc.;a; 31 iJUL 1914 Im this way. He also sounded me as to whether, in the event of the Russian consuls being told to desist from the collection of taxes, some arrangement could n °t jje reached under which the northern “ maliat ” should again be paid into the Banque d Escompte. I replied that there could be no possible trouble about reaching such an agreement,^ provided that the Imperial Bank was paid off the money advanced by it to the Treasury on that security. The Russian Bank would then have nothing to do but to advance money to the Treasury on the same terms as the Imperial Bank does to-day, but it could hardly be considered fair that the impoverished Persian Treasury should be forced to borrow money at a high rate of interest from the Russian^ Bank, when it could obtain the same money at a lower rate from the British Bank, which I had reason to know does very good business at this lower rate. M. Korostovetz pleaded that the less fortunate circumstances of the Russian Bank should be taken into account. To this I replied that I could not see why, as long as the conditions^ were fair, and no existing arrangements between the various Governments were infringed, the Persian Administration should be called upon to pay for the unlucky position of the Russian Bank or British interests be damaged. It was clear from the turn Rie conversation took that, as I had long suspected, the grievance that the 44 maliat of the northern provinces is paid into the Imperial Bank is not foreign to this effort on the part of the Russian Government to force a portion at least of the northern revenues into the coffers of the Banque d’Escompte. I then read M. Korostovetz Sir G. Buchanan’s telegrams No. 138 of the 2 1st June down to the passage where his Excellency reports that M. Sazonof declaied that he would not let Persia stand in the w^ay of the maintenance of good relations between England and Russia, and No. 141 of the 25th June. I called his special attention to the°fact that M. Sazonof appeared to be misinformed as to the capability of the financial administration to collect the taxes without the assistance^ of the Russian consuls. The Treasury can quite well do this, provided that no opposition is made to their operations by the Russian consuls, and that orders are issued to Russian subjects and protected persons to pay the taxes. ^ # , I urged that it is most desirable that an immediate stop shou.d be put to the abuse of extending Russian protection to anybody who seeks it in pursuit of his own ends. M. Korostovetz appeared ready to recognise that this abuse was a real one, and assured me that he had not since his arrival in Persia extended Russian protection to a | single Persian. He argued that it was impossible for a Russian Minister to refuse to do this when he was urged to do so by some Grand Duke whose support had been sought by an influential Persian. I replied that he was presumably alluding to certain special cases which had only served to bring discredit on the persons seeking Russian protection, but that the real abuse is caused by the manner in which the Russian consuls in the provinces extend wholesale protection to Persians. To such a pitch has this been carried that reports of a recent conflict between villagers under Russian protection with their neighbours under German protection in the province of Ispahan speak of the combatants as Russians and Germans. # M. Korostovetz asked me why I espoused the Persian cause so warmly. 1 replied that I did so for two reasons : firstly, because the attitude of Russia appeared to me to be at variance with the spirit of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, to the observance of which I felt myself in honour bound ; and, secondly, because Russian action clearlv caused damage to British interests, as I had already sliown him. He asked how the possession of landed property by Russians affected British interests. I replied that it did so only in so far that we had always scrupulously observed the meaning of the Treaty of Turkomanchai, and that by ignoring it Russians had stolen a march on us, and had acquired valuable property which British subjects, in some cases, would have gladly bought, had they been permitted to do so. It had, I said, been the system of lending money at usurious interest to impecunious Persians on mortgages of landed property that had brought the Russian Bank to what he had described to me as a critical situation. M. Korostovetz owned that whatever the meaning of clause 5 of the Treaty of Turcomanchai might be, the Banque d Escompte is precluded by the terms of its concession from lending money on the security of landed property. My Russian colleague gave me no hint that he thought that I had been made con versant with the contents of the note of protest before it was presented to him ; but, as I o-athered that he would like to know if I had had any share in it, and as doubtless mischief- makers had assured him that I had inspired it, I told him that upon the Persian Government seeking my advice as to whether such a note should be presented or not, 1 had asked for your instructions, Sir, as I knew that the situation in Persia was under discussion in London and St. Petersburgh, and that you had replied that I should te3 the Government here that I could not advise them, and that they must use their own judgment in the matter. I laughingly added that he had doubtless heard all sorts of stories about what I had done, as I had been solemnly assured that he had himself concocted the first note, subsequently cancelled by the Regent, with the Minister for ^oreign Affairs. . . ^ , When I came to the mention of the neutral zone, in reading Sir G. touchanan s telegram No. 141, M. Korostovetz expressed great inferest, and asked me to tell him all I knew about that part of the discussions which had taken place. I replied that I knew no more than was stated in the passage of the telegram I had just read, from which it appeared that the Russian Government favoured a partition of the zone, whilst His Majesty’s Government preferred not to alter the status quo. M. Korostovetz then repeated at great length what he had said to me previously, namely, that he had always considered the neutral zone a mistake, and that he had been confirmed in that opinion from a study of the archives of the last seven years, which he had made before coming here. I gathered from what he added that his opinion had been recently asked upon this point, and that he had replied that his experience since he had been in Persia had further strengthened his conviction. I understood from him that he had advocated the creation of a neutral zone formed of the capital and the province ot Tehran, somewhat on the lines of the district of Columbia in the United_States, and that he was in f av £ ur of Russia turning her entire attention to the consolidation of her interests in the five northern provinces, in which she should be given an entirely free hand, untrammelled by our “friendly remonstrances.” “People,” he said, “believe that because Tehran is in the Russian sphere it is entirely under _ the influence of the Russian Legation. Such, however, is not in fact the case, and British influence is greater than Russian. In reply to an enquiry as to what I thought about the zone question, I replied that it had always seemed to me that the disappearance of the neutral zone must eventually lead to partition. The recent feverish zeal of the Russian consuls at Ispahan, who appeared determined to create of that province a second Azerbaijan, mio-ht, however, well produce serious friction some day between British and Russian interests unless our respective attributes in the neutral zone were more clearly detined The acquisition by His Majesty’s Government of important interests m the oil-fields, and the practical Russification of a large tract of country by the administration ol the Zil-es-Sultan’s properties by the manager of the Russian Bank, had brought our interests into unpleasantly close touch. If the Karkunan irrigation scheme went through it would cause our respective influences to overlap in a manner that might be productive of an incident at any moment. . _ x* M. Korostovetz then said that he personally had never been in favour ol this scheme, both because he considered the field of operations too remote from Russia s legitimate sphere of interest, and because he much doubted the financial success of such a vast undertaking in the heart of Persia. He said that he had been surprised that we had not openly opposed the scheme from the first, and that he thought that it would have been more frank of us to ha ve done so. I replied that we had been perfectly frank in our attitude at the moment, as it did not then appear as if the scheme could do us any harm. Circumstances, I said, had now changed, and the acquisition of the important oil interests appeared to me to make it imperative that we should improve our existing nood relations with the Bakhtiaris. The introduction of a large_ Russian enterprise did not appear calculated to help us in this direction unless British capital and bntis engineers were associated with it, because he knew very well that the presence of a lame number of Russians on the outskirts of the Bakhtian country would be likely to lessen our influence over that tribe, or would at least give the chiefs a, chance of endeavouring to make use of each of us to our mutual disadvantage. Since seeing M. Korostovetz I have heard from Akbar Mirza, the son of the Zil closely connected with the scheme, that it has been practically abandoned. i i j + In conclusion, I said to M. Korostovetz that this frank exchange of views should at least serve to dispel a belief which appeared to have gained credence that our relations are not so cordial as they were in the past. We neither of us, I added had perhaps so much need of that expansiveness which was an amiable characteristic of M. Bokiewski but I felt sure that we understood each other, and that we were both imbued with an earnest desire to co-operate loyally and cordially in the execution of our duties m all matters in which our mutual interests are concerned. M. Korostovetz warmly recipro cated my sentiments, and we parted on the best of terms after a two hours conversation which had been marked throughout by friendly cordiality. I r» Q AT P WALTER TOWNLEY.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government] r &gt; [B] PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. CONFIDENTIAL [July 20.! Section 1. [32817] No. L Sir W. Townley to Sir Edioard Grey.—(Received July 20.) (No. ISO. Very Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, June 19, 1914. THE Russian Minister called upon me a few days ago to ask me for certain information about the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Syndicate, with a view apparently to ascertaining where the wells actually being worked are situated. M. Korostovetz did not appear to desire any detailed information. I pointed out on the map the various places where work is in progress. The conversation then turned upon general topics of interest, and I informed M. Korostovetz that I understood that the Persian question is to form the subject of early consideration on the part of our two Governments. 1 sketched roughly the nature of the communication you, Sir, made to the Russian Charge d’Affaires in London, the purport of which you did me the honour to communicate to me in your telegram No. 109 of the 4th instant. I also informed my Russian colleague of what had passed at the conversation between Sir G. Buchanan and M. Sazonof on the 9th instant. M. Korostovetz at once took up the cudgels for Arfa-ed-Dowleh, and said that he could not understand how M. Sazonof could have spoken in such a manner of a man whose breast is covered with high Russian decorations, and who is a personal friend of more than one Russian Grand Duke, and whose agrement as Persian Minister in St. Petersburg!! was practically obtained by M. Poklewski more than a year ago. M. Korostovetz appeared to attribute the opposition to Arfa-ed-Dowleh to M. Klemm, j who is anxious to retain Ishak Khan at St. Petersburgh as a means of communication with Saad-ed-Dowleh, whom he still strongly supports for the highest administrative : post in Persia after the Shah’s coronation. My Russian colleague then proceeded to j speak in disparaging terms of Saad-«d-Dowleh, who would be, he seemed to consider, an undesirable Prime Minister, both because he has no following, and because he would certainly prove himself an obstinate and difficult man to deal with. I replied that this might well be the case, more especially for Russia, as the Turkish Ambassador had told me that Saad had boasted to him that, if he came into power, he would clear all the Russian troops out of Azerbaijan in three months. The Ambassador appeared to have been much impressed by this tall talking on Saad’s part, which was doubtless only on a par with his assertion to the Turkish representative on the same occasion that all South Persia would be with him, the true fact being that South Persia is so afraid of what might happen if he came into power that negotiations are already on foot with a view to bringing about a combination of the important southern tribes to meet all possible eventualities. Saad, I said, had also told the Ambassador that he would only accept office on the distinct understanding that the two legations would not interfere in the formation of his Cabinet. This showed, it appeared, that he had changed his tactics since he endeavoured to form a Cabinet on his return to Tehran about eighteen months ago. On that occasion he used to send a trusted emissary to M. Poklewski once every two days with a fresh draft Cabinet for his approval. It might of course only mean that Saad is skilful at suiting his con versation to his listener. Anyhow, I added, he had won a new adherent to his cause in the Ambassador, whose faith in the amusing, loquacious old charlatan I had failed to shake. We then turned to the question of Azerbaijan, and M. Korostovetz stated that the ! Persian question had really little to do with the continued presence of Russian troops in that province. He volunteered that order had been sufficiently re-established to allow of a large number of the Russian troops being withdrawn, but, he added, “ the Viceroy of the Caucasus impressed upon me when I was at Tiflis, on my way here, that Russia cannot afford to leave the vulnerable southern frontier of the Caucasustmmm WBSii&amp;BBBKEmB 9. exposed to a possible aggressive movement on the part of Turkey. M. Korostovetz then said that Russia would never annex Azerbaijan by force of arms. To this statement I replied, “ No, you are content to do so by illegal purchase of landed properties.'’ M. Korostovetz laughed, and said that such a method is a perfectly legitimate one, and ^ should be encouraged. I answered that this at all events is being done by Russian consuls, not only in Azerbaijan, but in other northern provinces as well as in Ispahan, but more especially in Asterabad, where I understood that Russian agents were selling lands that do not belong to them to Russian immigrants, who are arriving a thousand at a time to colonise Persian territory. The contention that Russians could hold landed property in Persia appeared to me, I said, a novel one, and one that seemed quite at variance with the spirit of that clause of the Treaty of Turkmanchai which laid down that Russian subjects can possess residential property and places of business in towns, thus clearly indicating that they cannot possess real estate elsewhere. Moreover, it was a well-known fact that it was generally understood that foreigners could not hold such property. This had been recognised by his own predecessor, M. Poklewski, who had said to the Regent in my presence some two years ago that a revision of this habit, custom, law, prohibition, or whatever it might be, would be sought as one of the conditions of the loan which was then believed to be impending. The acceptance of the principle by Russian agents had further been confirmed quite recently by the representatives of the Russian Bank who went to London to settle the question of the mint contract with the Imperial Bank of Persia. At the conclusion of the negotiations they had solicited the friendly co-operation of their British colleagues in getting this very prohibition raised. I owned that the managers of the Russian Bank here, by lending large sums of money on landed properties to impecunious Persians, had apparently discounted the future revision of the prohibition, but he himself, on his arrival, had complained that the bank had done bad business, and had sought my intervention in order that the Imperial Bank might* make more room for them. I pointed out at the time that the British Bank would never compete in this business, which savoured more of money-lending at high rates of interest than of genuine banking business. M. Korostovetz replied that he could not agree with me that the Treaty of Turkmanchai gave any indication that foreigners could not hold landed property in Persia, but he said with a cynical laugh that he had told the Persian Government that he would not oppose their buying out the Russian owners if they made a loan for that purpose. He argued that it was always open to people to buy land in a foreign country, and refused to see that the conditions in Persia are different to those existing elsewhere, because the purchase of land here entails not only the land, but all that is on it and connected with it, including the labourers, passing practically out of Persian administration under that of the nearest Russian consul, who at once protected it as if it were a new-gotten piece of Russian territory, taxes not even being paid unless they were collected by the Russians, in the which case the Persian Government heard no more about them. M. Korostovetz then said that he had been asked soon after he came to Tehran what he was going to do to assist the regeneration of Persia. He had replied that he had received no instructions from St. Petersburg!! about that. All he had been told to do was to endeavour to get the Urmia Concession and one or two others, and to secure an increase of the Cossack brigade. He concluded that Persia could look after her own regeneration. He then went on to say that it was ridiculous to expect that the Russian representative would interest himself in the welfare of a foreign country, however unfortunate, except in so far as that welfare coincided with the furtherance of Russian interests. It was different for me, who represented what would probably be generally voted the most civilised and most civilising country in the world, whereas no one would call Russia civilised. The same argument held good, he continued, as far as supporting the constitutional form of government is concerned. Such an attitude is natural to an Englishman, who has constitutional institutions inbred in his bones, but it was folly to suppose that a Russian can genuinely support such a form of government. He had, he said, sent numerous telegrams to Shuja-ed-Dowleh, in accordance with his instructions, urging him to facilitate the elections, but how could he, the representative of a country in which the Duma will probably be swept away in a few months, put forward arguments to convince Shuja of the desirability of a Constitution. I have reported this conversation at some length because it appears to me interesting as showing the spirit which animates my Russian colleague. Outside indicationswould make it appear doubtful whether he has telegraphed to St. Petersburgh in the sense of the language he held about Arfa-ed-Dowleh. I have also good reason to believe that, despite what his personal opinion about Saad-ed-Dowleh may be, he is strenuously carrying out instructions from St. Petersburgh to push his candidature as •/hime Minister after the coronation. I hope to be in a position to report further upon this subject in a later despatch. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY.CONFIDENTIAL. Sir W.

I 111 reference to my telegram No. 185 of to-day’s date, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of an unsigned memorandum which was presented to the Russian Minister by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 27th instant. This document, which recapitulates Persia’s various grievances against the recent actions of Russian officials in Azerbaijan and elsewhere, would have been handed to M. Korostovetz on the previous day had he not adopted the somewhat peculiar attitude of refusing to see Vossugh-ed-Dowleh on that day, although he must have been aware that yesterday being a Persian holiday it was not a convenient day for the Minister to make the communication. Vossugh-ed-Dowleh came to me directly from the Russian Legation and handed me a copy of the memorandum he had left with M. Korostovetz. His Excellency requested me to send you this document, Sir, and said that the Persian Government solicited the good offices of His Majesty’s Government as a signatory of the Anglo- Russian Convention of 1907, to which Persia had adhered, in representing to the Russian Government that the action of the Russian officials in Azerbaijan and elsewhere was contrary to the spirit of that arrangement. I informed Vossugh-ed-Dowleh that the question was occupying the attention of the Governments of London and St. Petersburgh, and that I had reason to believe that a friendly exchange of views had already taken place. I subsequently saw the Russian Minister, who told me that he had replied to Vossugh-ed-Dowleh that he would transmit the memorandum to his Government, but had pointed out in his own name that it would be more easy to reach a settlement of the questions at issue if the Persian Government made some proposals of a nature to make it appear that they were anxious to reach a friendly settlement. I told M. Korostovetz that the Persian protests appeared to me to be perfectly legitimate ones, and that the Government could hardly be expected to suggest offering favours in return for the abolition of what they considered to be abuses. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Unsigned Memorandum communicated to Russian Minister by Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. A LA veille du couronnement de Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah, le Gouvernement persan attache une grande importance a ce que cette solennite ait lieu dans un atmosphere de calme et de tranquillite; il a egalement c\ coeur de pouvoir, dans la mesure du possible, resoudre les difficultes qui genent la marche des affaires du pays.

After reading aloud to me those portions of it which had reference to Persia, and after saying that he had on the preceding day read the memorandum which had been given to Count Benckendorff, the Emperor enquired whether it was only recently that the situation in North Persia had been causing-His Majesty’s Government such grave preoccupation. I replied that, though the anxiety which that situation was causing them had recently become acute, it had been of gradual growth. I had personally in the summer of last year advocated a frank exchange of views on the subject of Persia, as I had even then feared that the trend of events in the northern provinces would sooner or later create a situation that might prove fatal to the Anglo-Russian understanding. Since then events had been moving rapidly, and North Persia was now to all intents and purposes a Russian province. In saying this E begged His Majesty to believe that we did not for a moment doubt the assurances which he had given us as to his determination not to annex any portion of Persian territory. We were making no complaints, we were only recording actual facts. Unforeseen events had led to the occupation of certain districts in Northern Persia by Russian troops, and little by little the whole machinery of the administration had been placed in the hands of the Russian consuls. The Governor-General of Azerbaijan was a mere puppet, who received and carried out the orders of the Russian consul-general, and the same must be said of the Governors at Resht, Kazvin, and Julfa. They were one and all agents of the Russian Government, and acted in entire independence of the Central Govern ment at Tehran. Vast tracts of land in North Persia were being acquired by methods which were neither legal nor defensible, large numbers of Persians were being con verted into Russian-protected subjects, and the taxes were being collected by the Russian consuls to the exclusion of the agents of the Persian financial administration. The above system was being extended to Ispahan and even to the neutral zone. We had not the slightest desire to dispute Russia’s predominant interests and position in the north, but it was the methods by which that predominance was being asserted and the attempts that were being made to extend it to the neutral zone that compelled us to ask ourselves whether the time had not come for us to take measures to safeguard our own important interests in that zone and on the Persian Gulf. I had ventured to speak thus frankly to His Majesty, as I felt that the whole question of Anglo-Russian collaboration not only in Persia but in Europe was at stake. The actions of the Russian consuls had a cumulative effect, and, though the consuls were no doubt animated by the laudable desire of advancing Russian interests in Persia, they forgot that the policy that they were pursuing must react unfavourably on Anglo-Russian relations all over the world. His Majesty was aware that without the support of j Parliament His Majesty’s Government, much as they might desire it, would be powerless to maintain the Anglo-Russian understanding on its present close and intimate footing. The sympathies of both the Liberal and Conservative parties were being gradually alienated by what was happening in North Persia, and it w T as impossible for you to defend the actions of the Russian consuls or to represent them as according with the principles of Persian independence and integrity laid down in the Anglo- Russian Agreement of 1907. The Emperor, who throughout our conversation, which lasted over an hour, spoke to me in the most gracious and friendly manner, said that he heartily welcomed a frank exchange of views as calculated to remove the danger of any possible misunderstanding PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. B] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 10 . [June 29.] [ 29082 ] No. 1. (No. 192.) Sir, Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edioard Greu.—(Received June 29.) 192.) I HAD the honour of being received in audience yesterday by the Emperor and St Petersburgh, June 25, 1914. of delivering to him the letter which the King had commanded me to hand personally in the future. He quite understood the motives which had induced the King to write [2159 #—10] ^2 to him. The present situation in North Persia had been brought about by circum stances which the Russian Government could not control. It had originated with the troubles caused by the Fedais in Tabriz and by the necessity which had subsequently arisen of safeguarding Russia’s very important interests in the north. No one regretted this necessity more than himself. In the first place, he could give me his word of*^ honour that he sincerely desired to withdraw his troops, and, in the second, he felt that he was laying himself open to the suspicion of acting contrary to the assurances which he had given us. We were not the first to complain of the action of the Russian consuls. The Viceroy of the Caucasus had quite recently addressed a similar complaint to him, and had called his serious attention to the fact that each consul struck out a line of policy of his own without any regard for the general line of policy prescribed by his Govern ment. The first thing, therefore, to be done was to control his consuls, and he would cause the whole matter to be enquired into by a committee at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Emperor then turned the conversation on to the question of the neutral zone, and expressed the strong conviction that by far the simplest and most rational maimer of defining our respective positions with regard to it was to partition it. I replied that, though I personally entirely agreed with His Majesty that if misunderstandings were to be avoided in the future some agreement ought to be come to as to what Russia and England were respectively entitled to do in that zone, His Majesty’s Government had, I believed, no desire to extend their responsibilities by enlarging the area of their present zone. We were a naval, and not a military, Power, and we did not wish to make unnecessary calls on our Indian armv. Subsequently the Emperor said that he would reply personally to the King’s letter, and that in the meanwhile he would have all the points raised in the memoran dum communicated to Count Benckendorff most carefully examined at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I would no doubt also continue my conversations with M. Sazonof. It might, he thought, be, perhaps, necessary for us to revise the agreement of 1907, and if such a course commended itself to His Majesty’s Government he was quite ready to consent to its revision. He could only tell me, as he had often told me before, that his one desire was to remain firm friends with us and that, if he could prevent it, nothing should stand in the way of the closest possible understanding between Great ! Britain and Russia. After leaving the Emperor I met M. Sazonof at a garden party given in honour of the British squadron, and again later in the day at the Embassy dinner. In the course of the two conversations which I had with his Excellency I informed him of all that had passed at my audience with His Majesty. M. Sazonof professed to make light of the difficulties raised by the action of the Russian consuls. He defended their action in the matter of the collection of taxes on the ground that they were but doing what M. Mornard had asked them to do, and he contended that it was impossible for them to refuse to take under their protection persons who appealed to them to protect them against extortion and violence. I told his Excellency that he was under an entire misapprehension on both these points. It was owing to the action of the consuls that Russian-protected persons had refused to pay taxes when those taxes were collected by M. Mornard’s agents, and if M. Mornard subsequently, and without the authorisation of the Persian Government, consented to the taxes being collected by the consuls and paid into the Russian Bank, it was because M. Korostovetz had urged this course and because M. Mornard feared that, if he did not agree to it, the consuls would prevent any taxes being paid. As regarded what he had said about Russian-protected subjects, he was wilfully blinding himself to the fact that by an organised system of Russian immigration, and by the conversion of Perisand into Russian-protected subjects, whole districts were being treated as Russian territory. M. Sazonof refused to admit this, and proceeded to complain of the action of the Imperial Bank in continuing to receive the taxes collected in the Russian zone. I replied that, by their charter which had been acquired before the signature of the agreement of 1907, the Imperial Bank were empowered to conduct financial operations all over Persia, and that, if M. Mornard preferred to deal with them rather than with the Russian Bank, it was simply because they had shown a greater readiness to transact business with him on fairer and more reasonable terms. M. Sazonof tells me that he will send me a written reply to our memorandum in a few days, and he seems prepared to meet our wishes to a certain extent by exercising a greater control over the Russian consuls and by discontinuing the present system under which the taxes are collected through their agency. On my observing to himyesterday that he would take a very different view of things could he see with his own eyes all that the consuls were doing, he said that he might, perhaps, send an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on a tour of inspection to report on the whole question. *He further told me that he had spoken to the Emperor as to the advisability of f transferring M. Korostovetz to another post, as he had grounds for believing that the relations between our two legations were not as good as they should be. He | complained, however, of the tone of recent debates in the House of Commons and of the inveterate suspicion with which Russia was regarded in England. One would think, he said, from the language used whenever Russia was credited with harbouring designs of aggiandisement that England had never laid her hands on Baluchistan and other territoiies adjoining India in order the better to secure the strategic safety of oui Indian Empire. I replied that I was not aware that we had ever annexed territory m violation of a formal agreement with another and friendly Government. The , suspicions of which he had spoken would inevitably be fostered were the progressive advance of Russian political influence to be extended south through the neutral zone. \ \\ hile it is, I think, possible that we may come to some agreement on the two points above referred to, it will be very difficult to obtain a guarantee that will ensure the stiict observance of the agreement thus arrived at. What, however, presents the gi eatest difficulty of all is the question of the neutral zone. Both the Emperor and M. Sazonof advocate its partition. The latter yesterday remarked to me that he could not consent to our absorbing the whole of it, and I am very strongly of opinion that, if there are insuperable objections to partition, we must, by an exchange of notes, clearly define oui respective positions with regard to it. The Indian Government appear to hold that we must assert our commercial and political predominance in that zone, but that we must at the same time refrain from adding to our responsibilities by extending the area of our present sphere. These two points of view are, so far as I am able to judge, incompatible, nor do I know on what ground we can claim predominant political influence in the neutral zone without a revision of the 1907 agreement. I have, moreover, always failed to understand how we shall add to our responsibilities by the incorporation in our own sphere of some portion of the neutral zone. If we have important interests to defend we shall have to defend them whether they lie within or without our sphere, and the mere fact that we shall have a more extensive sphere of influence than at present does not, to my mind, entail the obligation of defending it by force of arms. Should, in the future, differences of a serious character arise between Russia and Great Britain we should be perfectly free to choose our own ground from the strategical point of view for the defence of India. I do not myself foresee the slightest ground for apprehending an Anglo-Russian conflict for years to come, but nothing, I venture to think, is more calculated to create tension between the two countries than to leave the neutral zone, as it is at present, a debatable ground, about which there will be constant bickerings and mutual recriminations. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN.[This Docmnent is the Property of His Britannic M^iesty s Government.] [A] PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [31801] No. 1. [July 14.] Section 1. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 14.) (No. 215.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, July 11, 1914. WITH reference to my telegram No. 153 of to-day, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith translation of an aide-memoire which has been communicated to me by M. Sazonof, and which contains the reply of the Russian Government to the memorandum handed to the Russian Ambassador in London on the situation in Persia. I M 5} VP cxP ’GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum communicated to Sir G. Buchanan hy M. Sazonof. (Translation.) IN the memorandum submitted by the British Foreign Office to the Imperial Embassy in London, and dated the 10th June of this year, the views of the London Cabinet are put forward as to the present position occupied by Russia in Persia, and the opinion expressed is, in effect, that the actions of Russian representatives in Northern Persia are undermining the principle of the independence and integrity of the country on which the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 is based. In support of this opinion the following data are quoted :— The Governor-General of Tabriz has become an autonomous ruler who does not obey the instructions of the Central Persian Government, and at times even acts in direct defiance of orders given him. He is at the same time completely under the control of the Russian Consulate-General, the commands of which he obeys implicitly, and the support of which deprives the Central Government of the possibility of calling this personage to account. Further, Persian Governors such as, for instance, those at Resht, Kazvin, and Julfa (Ispahan) are in fact selected, or at least maintained, in their posts by Russian consuls, and their residence in the locality is conditional on their acting in full accordance with the wishes of Russian representatives. The Central Government do not dare to dismiss them except with the consent of the Russians, however revolu tionary, dishonourable, or' generally unsatisfactory their behaviour may be. The Russian Minister at Tehran recently called for the resignation of the Minister for the Interior, who, it is said, is one of the least incapable and inactive of the officials of the State, and was selected for this post upon the recommendation of the Russian Government itself. By affording Russian protection to individual persons in Azerbaijan, Meshed, and even in such southern localities as Ispahan, Russian administrative control has to a considerable degree extended to the financial administration, which in consequence is at times seriously embarrassed thereby. In Azerbaijan there have been instances when a great portion of the taxes due from persons under Russian protection have been collected, entirely independently of the Persian financial administration, by Russian consuls who have deposited the money in the Russian Bank without rendering any account of the amounts thus taken from the Persian Treasury. The result of this action has been the complete disorganisation of the finances of this province. Without annexing Northern Persia in the full sense of the word, the Russian Government have practically acquired the supreme political authority and a preponderating influence through their agents in the entire administration, which, if not in name, has in fact become Russian. The result of Russian methods of action in Northern Persia in connection with the unsatisfactory position of a: [2192 o—l] 17 JUL1914 r-,2 and north-west of almost a monopoly for Russian trade. With the impetus &lt;nven to this trade by the substitution in the north of Russian for Persian authority, it must inevitably develop a tendency to penetrate to the south also, replacing both here and there British and other foreign trade which can only enter Persia by southern trade routes, and is entirely cut off when these routes are closed. Further, a general tendency, it is said, is observed for Russian political influence to extend to the neutral zone, as is evidenced from the action of the Russian consul at Ispahan and his intervention m the duties of the Governor-General of this province as also ±rom the project for an irrigation concession at the source of the Karkunan Before proceeding to a review of the above-quoted points from the memorandum ol the London Cabinet, the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs deem it necessary to express certain general considerations on the question of Russian methods of action in -L eisia m connection with the situation in that country. ft is well known to the British Government with what complications the cnamge ol the btate regime in Persia was attended, and how the events which took place in that country reflected adversely on Russian interests, which, owing to the contiguity of the two countries and the close economic ties which have long since existed between them, appreciably exceed, at least in the northern part o iersia, the interests of any other Power. Without entering into details it must be noted that the decline of the Government authority and the disorders w uc i arose as the result of anarchy in the country caused losses amounting to many millions to Russian subjects, and even led to no small sacrifice of human life At the same time during this period, with rare exceptions, there was noticeable a systematic attitude of ill-will towards Russia on the part of Persian ruling spheres imbued with ultra-nationalistic ideas not in accordance with the cultural or ethical’ level of these spheres, or with the general economic and political condition of Persia. -p ndUC ^ ? con dition of affairs the Imperial Government, to their extreme regret found themselves compelled to take their interests in northern Persia into their own hands by the installation of Russian troops in the more important localities. This step which was attended with considerable material sacrifice and other inconveniences for Russia, resulted m the establishment of comparative order within the localities specified, to the general advantage not only of Russian subjects, but also of other oreigners, and, above all, of the local population. The presence of Russian columns m Persia has not borne, and does not bear, at the present time, however, any character o t le nature of an occupation, as the Russian troops are in no way concerned with the internal life and administration of the country. The task of the columns is to maintain order by the prevention of bloodshed and armed attacks between mutually hostile local parties. _ On the other hand, such circumstances as the weakness of the ties uniting the provinces with the centre, and the above-mentioned feeling of the latter as also the impossibility of permitting anti-Russian agitation, lawlessness, violence! extortion, Ac., m localities where the troops are quartered have inevitably demanded the exercise of certain action on the local authorities by the Russian consular representatives who have been compelled nolens volens to take upon themselves to a certain degree a leading role m local affairs m order to avoid complications which might have far more seiious consequences. Again, local Persian administrators sincerely desirous of main taining order m the provinces entrusted to them, and who have not aimed solely at the giatification of the nationalistic tendencies of the Extreme Liberal parties in the capital or at deriving personal material benefits from their official position, have naturally sought a rapprochement with Russian representatives, clearly recognising that only u it i their support and the presence of Russian detachments can the aims for which j * hey are stri ™g ^ attained. Owing to this, the necessary state of affairs has now ; been created, by virtue of which in the majority of the northern provinces of Persia a i predominating influence of Russian consular representatives is noticeable. This m ijence wings about those conditions under which only is a peaceful development of local tile and safety of person and property conceivable, with the natural result of prosperity of trade and industry. Although a recognition of this is possibly displeasing to the national self-respect of Persian-ruling spheres, the people every- w ere fully appreciate the blessings which they obtain in this manner, blessings w ich they could scarcely obtain at an early date under a weak and inconsistent Government, the activity of which is hampered by the absence of solidarity and an almost incessant struggle by separate individuals for power. The Imperial Government, as formerly, free from all aggressive aims and in no way dreaming of any forcible acquisitions whatever, consider that in addition to safeguarding their strictly commercial and industrial interests in Persia, they have a3 cultural mission to perform, the pacification of the Persian provinces adjoining Russia, and the bestowal of tranquillity on their population, closely bound economically and by conditions of life with the population of their own outlying regions. They are of the opinion that this duty will rest on them until the Persian Government themselves shall be in a position to guarantee law and order throughout the country. Turning to the separate points of the British memorandum, the Imperial Government think it their duty to put forward the following explanation :— The most important province of Persia, from the point of view of Russian interests t , fTn Azerbaijan, from time immemorial closely connected with the Caucasus. The Imperial Government cannot be indifferent as to who stands at the head of this province, which still quite recently was the scene cf the greatest disorders and most unbridled action by the dregs of the so-called Persian revolution. After a series of unsuccessful local rulers, appointed by the Central Persian Government, the power finally passed into the hands of the present Governor-General, Shuja-ed-Dowleh, who from the very commencement displayed great firmness and a full knowledge of local conditions, and knew how to restore order in the province within a comparatively short period of time, and to inspire the necessary respect towards himself. It is natural that such a personality won the approval of the Russian Government, and commenced to enjoy the full support of their local representatives. Unfortunately, however, the Tehran Cabinet up to the present have been unable to reconcile themselves to the fact that Shuja-ed-Dowleh has established himself in Azerbaijan by an unusual method, Te., without the proper reverences and gifts in Tehran. Sympathy with the ex-Shah, of which he is usually charged, was fully refuted by the manner in which he acted during the attempt of Mahomet Ali to recover his lost throne. Persistently following one aim only—the restoration and maintenance of older in his province, Shuja-ed-Dowleh remained a true servant of the Government, deviating only from the execution of such proposals of the latter as either were conti ary to the aim specified, or threatened to involve him in a conflict with the Russians, whose support he naturally valued as the sole means for a successful realisation of his task. Appreciating the ability and great energy of this man, the Imperial Govern ment cannot but esteem him, and wish that he may retain authority as long as possible. Unfortunately, however, Shuja-ed-Dowleh himself is now with increasing frequency complaining of bad health, and is desirous of the necessary lest, theiefoie the question of his replacement by another has perforce become one for consideration, and has already formed the subject of discussion with the Government of the Shah. ^ As regards the selection of persons for administrative posts, and also the changing of such, this, in accordance with old-established custom, has always been effected by ( agreement between the Imperial and Persian Governments. So far as is known, the British Government have also enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, this right, an instance of which w r as recently noted in Seistan and Kainat. This right of a voice in such \ questions by the two Powers most interested in Persian affairs arises from the necessity that by a due choice of persons they shall guarantee their vital interests in their respective spheres of influence. It is impossible, moreover, not to note here that Russian representatives, of course, never support Governors of revolutionaiy, dishonourable, and unsatisfactory character.” The resignation of the former Minister • for the Interior, Prince Ein-ed-Dowleh, a typical Persian of the old regime, was evoked chiefly because he renewed to its full extent the former method of sale of posts, and foi the sake of his own interested, avaricious aims removed men useful fiom a Russian point of view. Apart from this, the Prince, in search of popularity among the extreme nationalists, commenced to conduct a policy clearly ill-disposed towards Russia, while, on the other hand, as is Atell known to the Imperial Government, playing a double game and secretly in touch with the reactionary elements, assuring them of his immutable devotion to absolutism. Such duplicity could only have the most ruinous consequences from the point of view of the establishment of tranquillity in the country which is so desirable. It is impossible not to mention, among others, also those intrigues which Ein-ed-Dowleh conducted against other members of the Cabinet, as,^ for instance, Vosug-ed-Dowleh, who were recognised by the Russian and British Governments as the most useful members of this Cabinet. . , . n During the burdensome times through which Persia has lived and is in part still passing, and owing frequently to the insecurity of person and property, the number oi natives seeking the protection of foreign representatives has undoubtedly considerably °rown. In this category are principally those persons who are under financial obliga Sons to banks and trading firms and the ruin of whom would involve severe loss tor the latter, and also persons who, during the difficult time of persecution ol everyt img [2192 o—l] 15 24 Russian in Persia had the courage, as formerly, to display feelings of friendliness towards Russia. The protection of such persons from persecution and violence is naturally the duty of Russian representatives in Persia. This institution of protected persons is undoubtedly undesirable in principle and conducive of no little trouble, but it will automatically disappear when law, order, and respect for the political convictions of others are reinstated in the country. Noting in passing that Ispahan, although it lies somewhat to the south, forms, nevertheless, a portion of the zone apportioned to Russian influence by the agreement of 1907, the Imperial Government cannot accept as correct the opinion that the protection afforded to the above-mentioned persons is a source of embar rassment or loss to the finances of Persia. On the contrary, the Imperial Government maintain that it is only owing to the co-operation afforded by the Russian representa tives to the Persian financial administration that the latter is in a position to realise its functions, and regularly to increase the revenue of the Treasury of the Shah. The difficulties which this administration at times meets in its path are for the most part the result of ignorant methods and an unwillingness on the part of its separate organs to reckon with local conditions of life and other peculiarities. Among these organs, ) unfortunately, are certain Belgian officials, who do not listen to the good advice offered them by the Russian representatives having relations with them, and always tendered in a kindly spirit. The frequent conflicts which have in consequence arisen between officials of the “ maliat ” administration on the one hand, and Russian subjects, together with those under Russian protection, on the other, induced the Imperial' Minister, in agreement with the Chief Treasurer of Persia, to entrust the collection of taxes from these persons to Russian consuls, with the participation of the Discount and Loan Bank of Persia. By this measure, among others, has been partially decided the question of the deposit in the above-named bank of the Government revenues of Northern Persia, which, contrary to the spirit of the Anglo-Russian agree ment of 1907, M. Mornard, since 1913, has been placing in the British Bank. However, the Persian Government saw a violation of their rights in this first attempt to introduce a new method, guaranteeing the Government of the Shah an accurate receipt of taxes and avoidance of such highly undesirable mutual friction and recrimination, and M. Mornard hastened, not only to repudiate the agreement concluded with them, but even to talk of the arbitrary actions of Russian consuls. At present, the question of the collection of the “ maliat ” from Russian subjects and proteges also forms a subject of negotiation between the Imperial and Persian Governments and with a readiness on the part of the latter to meet half way the legitimate wish that the revenues of the northern provinces shall be deposited with the Russian Bank, as was done in 1912, and with the establishment of a certain control by the consulates as regards the correctness of the assessment, a favourable settlement of the question appears fully possible. It is scarcely necessary to mention that a precise account is kept of all sums collected by Russian consuls, and that not one copeck of these amounts is taken from the Persian Treasury. If the Persian Financial Department state otherwise such statement does ] not merit belief. Owing principally to the geographical position of the two countries, Russian trade has always predominated in northern and north-western Persia over the trade of all other States. If the imports of the latter have specially diminished of late years it is due—as is justly remarked in the British memorandum—chiefly to the absence of safety for traffic along the caravan routes of southern Persia. However, the Imperial Government cannot but recall that on their part they have never placed any obstacles in the way of the British Government in its endeavours to secure an effective protection of the southern routes. As regards the penetration of Russian wares into Southern Persia, no such movement is at present noticeable, and even appears to be little likely beyond the limits of the Ispahan province, which constitutes, as has been already pointed out, a portion of the Russian sphere of influence. Finally, with reference to the mention made in the memorandum of the tendency of Russian influence to extend into the neutral zone, it can only be said that such tendency may to a certain degree appear only in the Ispahan province, as is shown by the instance cited in the British memorandum of projected irrigation work in the same region. Moreover, the appearance of influence and a realisation of economic enterprise within the limits of the neutral zone is not forbidden either Power by the Anglo-Russian agreement, and, so far as is known, Great Britain is taking wide advantage of this right in Bakhtiaria, and in her relations with such persons, as, for instance, the Sheikh Khasal of Mohammerah. In concluding with this point their reply (to the memorandum), the soundness of5 which can scarcely be denied, the Imperial Government cannot conceal their profound regret that their actions in Persia, dictated by vital necessity, regularly meet with such evident mistrust from British public opinion, notwithstanding repeatedly given assurances as to the entirely disinterested motives of Russia, confirmed by all her actions during the period of the Persian crisis. This symptom is all the more to be regretted in that its action may extend far heyond the limits of the comparatively narrow scope of Persian affairs, and may find an echo in other points of contact of the interests of the two Powers. Deeming such consequences as equally undesirable and even dangerous for the two friendly Governments, and endeavouring by every possible means to assist in the removal of the above-mentioned distrust, nourished apparently to a considerable extent by traditional fears in India of a possible Russian invasion of that country, the Imperial Government are prepared with all attention and good wishes to consider, jointly with the London Cabinet, what measures can be taken with a view to a lasting establishment of a reciprocal correct understanding and complete confidence, which is so important for their respective interests. o[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA.

Since, however, the Russian Government suggest Sardar Reshid as the particular candidate for the post which Sir W. Townley should be instructed to suppoit, Sir E. Grey cannot disguise the fact that, according to the information furnished to His Majesty’s Government, Sardar Reshid’s previous history from the days of his employment as a menial in the service of the Governor of Ardebil has been such as to inspire the greatest possible mistrust both as to his capacity and as to his personal character.

Sir, Tehran, June 10, 1914. I HAVE the honour to enclose copy of a despatch from the acting consul-general at Ispahan, which gives some account of the difficulties which are created for the Govern or-General by the Russian consulate-general in that town. I brought the ques tion of M. Evreinof’s written injunction to Samsam-es-Sultaneh not to send his agents M. Korostovetz promised to refer the matter to Ispahan, and subsequently informed me that M. Evreinof and M. von Kaver, the manager of the Russian Bank, had informed him that it was impossible to allow Samsam-es-Sultaneh to send his agents to villages under Russian administration because the sole object in doing so was to extort money from the peasants. Such a charge as this is easy to make, more especially when previous Bakhtiari Governors have made themselves notorious by their oppressive exac tions, but I am disinclined to think that Samsam-es-Sultaneh would be animated by such a motive, and it is almost certain that he would not choose villages under Russian administration as a suitable field for such proceedings. I pointed this out to M. Koros tovetz, and said that it appeared to me that it this principle were maintained it would render the task of the Governor-General an impossible one. It appeared to me that Russian administration of a property could hardly be held, with any justification, to authorise such property being considered as conquered territory in the heart of a friendly country. M. Korostovetz replied that he understood that an agreement had been made under which each party undertook to consult the other when necessity arose. I said that such an arrangement appeared to me unobjectionable, but I have not heard from Ispahan of any such understanding having been reached. The second incident reported by Mr. Bristow is again typical of Russian behaviour, and is even more significant, because it shows that the example of the consulate-general is closely followed by Russian subjects having no official standing, and who would certainly not dare to act in such a manner were they not sure of the support of the consulate. _ . . M. Evreinof’s meddling in the formation of the Committee of Overseers, appointed to arrange the procedure of the elections, was also a high-handed and improper proceeding, typical of the mentality of Russian officials in the Russian zone, who would appear to consider that the Anglo-Russian understanding gave them the right to act as if the portion of Persia north of the neutral sphere had been handed over to them to do what they like with it. The attitude of the acting Russian consul-general in the matter of the refusal of Samsam-es-Sultaneh to nominate the agent of the consulate-geneial Governor of Julfa is also quite unwarrantable. Not only had the Russian consul, in my opinion, no h busmess to meddle in such an affair without consulting his British colleague, Julfa being in the neutral zone, but the person in question is a most undesirable character, whose behaviour has necessitated numerous complaints on my part, as well as upon that of the German Minister, the Turkish Ambassador and the Persian Government. I have also called the attention of M. Korostovetz to this matter. Samsam-es-Sultaneh, as you are 'aware, Sir, was put forward as a suitable Governor-General for Ispahan after I had consulted with M. Sabline, who submitted the proposal to St. Petersburgh for sanction. My sole object in suggesting Samsam-es- _ , r K , T 1 T° T 1 • i l J.1 _ 1 i. 4-' ' Plo o nrl o [B] PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA.

JSultaneh was because I believed him to be the best of t.2 one who was likely to retrieve, at least in a measure, the good name of the Bakhtiaris, which had suffered greatly during the governorship of his immediate predecessors. Moreover I had good ground, I thought, to hope that his appointment would be agreeable to Sardar Jang, whose continued administration of the Bakhtiari country is most desirable. I was mistaken in this expectation, as subsequent events have shown. Previous Bakhtiari Governors have proved subservient tools of Russian policy in Ispahan, on the principle that a peaceful life is the best and most lucrative. The fact that Samsam will not bow the knee to M. Von Kaver, who is the ruling spirit of Ispahan, and to M. Evreinof, has sufficed to acquire for him his determined Russian opposition. Akber Mirza, the son of the Zil-es-Sultan and a liege Russian henchman, who is now in Tehran, loses no opportunity of saying openly that Samsam-es-Sultaneh must be got out of Ispahan at all costs. _M. von Kaver has assured me that he has greatly assisted Samsam-es-Sultaneh in his endeavours to capture a notorious brigand called Reza Khan Joozani, but the fact remains that this outlaw always succeeds in taking refuge in some village of the Zil-es- Sultan’s, into which Samsam’s men are forbidden to penetrate. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul-General Bristow to Sir W. Townley. {No. 16. Confidential.) ^ r ’ T XT X 7 T? i Ispahan, May 8, 1914. the honour to report that during the last few weeks I have had many interviews with the Governor-General, and the constant subject of his Excellency’s conversation has been the difficulties put in his way by the Russian consul, Evreinof, and the manager of the Russian bank, M. von Kaver, ably assisted by their agents, notably a M. Karopikof, agent in charge of the properties belonging to the Banu Osma, sister of the Zil-es-Sultan. Samsam-es-Sultaneh showed me yesterday a letter from the Russian consul, in which M. Evreinof stated in black and white that the Governor-General had no right to send his agents to a certain village as it was “ connected with a Russian subject ” ; that is to say, to a village less than half of which is leased to M. Karopikof. What had actually happened was that the Governor-General, having heard a complaint against a certain Government soldier who happened to be residing in the village, was sending to arrest him, when M. Evreinof, hearing of the Governor-General’s intention, sent his Excellency the above letter. The Governor-General was naturally very annoyed at the Russian consul’s letter, and had prepared a stiff answer. I suggested, aowever, that instead of sending this answer—which could only have had the effect of further straining his relations with the Russian consulate—His Excellency should reply that the contents of the Russian consul’s letter were of such importance that he had reported the whole matter to his Government and awaited their instructions. Another case ol a similar nature occurred a few weeks ago : Samsam-es-Sultaneh sent two men to arrest a certain ryot at a village named Mousi Abad ; on their return to Ispahan with their prisoner M. Karopikof seized all three, kept the Governor’s men prisoners for the night and the following morning sent the ryot back to his village. The matter of the forthcoming elections too has been a cause of much friction between the Russian consul and the Governor-General. * A few weeks ago the Governor published a notice giving a list of seven persons employed as a committee of overseers to undertake the management of the elections. M. Evreinof immediately wrote to the Governor-General requesting him in a peremptory manner to appoint a certain Mirza Hassan Ali Khan, saying that among the number of these overseers there should certainly be one to represent the interests of the Zil-es-Sultan. M. Evreinof added that he could not understand why the Governor-General had passed over this gentleman although he had nominated a man in foreign employ; by this M. Evreinof referred to the appointment of the Imperial Bank, a worthv old gentleman, whose appointment I had certainly never sought and to which I attach no importance whatever. A third cause of friction between the Governor-General and the Russian consulatehas been the question of the price of bread : this the Eussian faction at Ispahan has exploited for all it is worth as a means of causing trouble for Samsam-es-Sultaneb. For some days a crowd of about forty men and women have been collecting at the door of the Eussian consulate shouting for bread and abusing the Governor-General. I venture to agree with Samsam-es-Sultaneh that this was entirely engineered by the agents of the Eussian consulate, and this idea is confirmed by the publication in the local newspaper, “ Ziandeh Eudd,” yesterday of a notice by the Eussian consul saying that for many days past crowds of men and women had taken refuge at the door ot his consulate imploring his aid to cheapen the price of bread in the town and, in spite of all his efforts with the Governor-General, the price remained as high and the quality as bad as before, he (M. Evreinof), therefore, had decided to open twelve shops at various points in the town in which good bread in sufficient quantities could be obtained at a reasonable price. As a matter of fact I am informed that this bread in no way differs either in price or quality from the average bread to be obtained at the ordinary bakers shops in the town ; the point, however, of M. Evreinofs notice in the papers can obviously only be to put the townspeople against the Governor-General. Another grievance of the Eussian consul against the Governor-General is concerning the governorship of Julfa, the Armenian quarter of Ispahan. For some years this had been given by previous Governors-General to the “ agent of the Eussian consulate. Samsam-es-Sultaneh on his arrival, despite the protests and demands of M. Evreinof, refused to allow him to continue in office. I venture to think that the Governor- General was quite justified in this action, seeing that this man is actually employed at the Eussian consulate in addition to having fulfilled his post in a very unsatisfactory The above will perhaps be sufficient to show your Excellency how the Russian party here are doing their best to make Samsam-es-Sultaneh’s position impossible and to compel him to resign. The impression is firmly rooted in the town that Samsam-es- Sultaneh owes his appointment to your Excellency and that he was sent here against the wishes of the Eussian Government. Before Samsam-es-Sultaneh arrived here M. Evreinof used openly to say that he would never come and now he has arrived he looks on it as essential to get rid of him as soon as possible. I am doing my best to encourage the Governor-General to be careful to see that the tone of his communications with the Eussian consul are such that the latter shall have no real ground of complaint against his Excellency.

No. I. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(^Received June 29.) No. 162.) Sir, Tehran, June 8, 1914. I HAVE the honour, with reference to my telegram No. 123 of the 7th May and to recent telegraphic correspondence upon the subject of the collection of taxes in North Persia by the Russian consulates from Russian subjects, Russian protected persons, and on account of Linds leased from Persians by the same, to transmit to you herewith copy of memorandum which the Treasurer-General has drawn up for the use of the Persian Government. It appears from this document that the action taken by the Russian Legation here was based upon a letter written to M. Korostovetz by M. Mornard on the 7th February last. The reason for this letter was a telegram from the Belgian financial agent at Tabriz complaining that for the most part the taxes that could not be recovered were those due from Russian subjects and protected persons who were supported in their refusal to pay by the Russian consulate-general. M. Mornard’s object in writing this letter would appear to have been to endeavour to enlist the sympathies of the new Russian Minister, who had assured him upon his arrival in Teh i an that he disapproved of Russian subjects and protected persons not paying their taxes due on properties owned in Persia. He points out in this letter that if there are any reasons of which he is ignorant that such persons should not pay their taxes, an arrangement might be made under which the Persian Government would agree that a special account should be opened at the Treasury into which all the land ■tax paid by Russian subjects throughout the northern provinces should be paid. M. Mornard added that the money thus collected would be deposited in the Banque d’Escompte (Russian Bank), but although he implied that such moneys might be used to meet foreign claims for postal robberies and other incidents, he specified that no usage should be made of the money until an agreement had been come to on the subject between the Persian Government and the Russian Legation. No mention was made in M. Mornard’s letter of the fact that the tax should he collected by the Russian consulates. No answer was returned to this communication, which was clearly in the nature of a proposal calling for a reply. On the 9th April the Minister for Foreign Affairs was informed that the Russian consulate-general at Tabriz had announced to the Governor- General and to the general public that from the previous 21st March (Noruz) Russian subjects and protected persons would have to pay the taxes due from them to the Persian Government into the Russian Bank through the consulate-general. It was added that any Persian subject who had leased his lands to a Russian subject would have to observe the same procedure. The Minister for Foreign Affairs at once caused a verbal remonstrance to be made to the Russian Minister, who replied that the arrangement had been made with M. Mornard, and produced the letter from the Treasurer-General quoted above in support of his contention. The emissary of the Minister for Foreign Affairs would seem to have read a more complete surrender of the position into M. Mornard’s letter than appears to me to have been intended, but the matter having been submitted to the Council of Ministers it was unanimously decided to disavow his action, and to inform the Russian Minister that the Treasurer-General had no authority to write in the name of the Persian Government, which formally refused to be bound by his proposal. In their keenness to throw a heavy stone at M. Mornard the Ministers would appear to have overlooked the conditional nature of the proposal made to M. Korostovetz, and to have ignored the fact that the latter had not closed with the bargain suggested to him. The Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs at St. Petersburgh has assured His Majesty’s Ambassador that the only object of the Russian Legation in issuing these instructions to the consuls in the provinces was to assist the Persian Government in the collection of the taxes. The same argument has been put forward by the acting consul-general at Ispahan, as also by M. Korostovetz here. It would seem to one who has followed the Persian question very closely for two years that invaluable assistance to the Persian Government in this direction might have been given long betbr^-tfim^by the [2159 —7] 'y i'll f 17JUL19H C' ii’UOH ■&gt;&gt; , T—j-ffre 'i.•&gt; simple issue of orders by the Russian consular authorities to all Russian subjects and protected persons to pay their taxes. The Treasurer-General has repeatedly, but ineffectually, pressed the Russian Legation to issue such orders, benevolently over looking the fact that the possession of landed property, other than that situat d in towns and requisite for business purposes, by foreigners is clearly forbidden by Persian' law. It is probable that, hitherto, Russian subjects have generally evaded the payment • of taxes, but at Resht their collection by the Russian consul has long been practised, though that official has never rendered any account of the sums collected, nor of the manner in which the money has been disbursed in the reduction of Russian claims that have neither been specified nor^sanctioned by the Persian Government. M. Mornard’s memorandum deals also with the fact that Shuja-ed-Dowleh has re-established a municipal council at Tabriz without the sanction of the Central Government, and that he has arbitrarily declared that certain important indirect taxes, to be devoted to the financial wants of the municipality, shall be collected under the old system of farming, and shall no longer be leviable by the Belgian financial administration. It has been clearly established from other sources, notably from a statement made personally to His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz, that this action of Shuja-ed-Dowleh was strongly supported, if not actually initiated, by the Russian consul-general at Tabriz, who would appear to have actually inspired an order concerning the proposed widening of certain streets, which it is proposed to carry out without making any provision for compensation to be paid to Persians or foreigners whose properties may suffer loss in the process. It is clearly desirable that such a measure for enlarging certain of the narrow streets of Tabriz, to meet the requirements of modern vehicular traffic, should be carried out, but it should be done on a system which would guarantee house-owners from arbitrary oppression and loss. Another point in the memorandum to which attention might be called is the intention to establish a Russian post office in the Djabba Khaneh, the acquisition of which State property by a Russian subject for a ridiculously inadequate sum of money formed the subject of a bitter protest on the part of the Persian Government some months ago. The Russian Minister has explained to me that it was never intended that the consul- general should establish a post office outside the consulate, and that he much regretted that M. Orlow had so misunderstood his instructions. M. Korostovetz states that his real intention is to diminish gradually what h is become a crying abuse, namely, the advantage taken of the convenience of the Russion legation weekly mail by persons not connected with Russian institutions, to despatch and receive letters and parcels from Europe. The same abuse apparenty existed at Tabriz. Upon the receipt of a complaint from the consul-general that his staff could not cope with the mass of postal matter, he had, he told me, advised him to seek from the Caucasus the assistance of regular postal officials to handle the correspondence, but he had intended that these officials should be attached to the consulate-general within the precincts of which the work would be carried out. M. Korostovetz added that he had himself written to St. Petersburg to request that a postal official be attached to the legation at Tehran to deal with the corres pondence which has became too great a tax upon the legation staff. He said that he has every intention of reducing the volume of correspondence that passes through the legation, although he cannot refuse to transmit letters and parcels sent by such people as Kamran Mirza, and other persons of position who have long enjoyed the privilege, and none of whom will consent to use the Persian post. This reluctance on their part to make use of an administration that works admirably is probably due to the fact that all their correspondence is addressed to the Ex-Shah, to his family and to other members of the reactionary party now domiciled in Europe. It would almost seem as if M. Korostovetz, in his anxiety to lessen an abuse, has taken steps calculated to call public attention to that abuse, and to bring about the establishment of a Russian post office here and at Tabriz that it may be hard to dislodge. There is no doubt that he is endeavouring to diminish the volume of postal matter passing through the legation, as he has circularised persons who have been in the habit of availing them selves of the convenience, to the effect that they must discontinue doing so. He has, in consequence, somewhat hurt the feelings of the French Minister, who claims that the courtesy shown here is reciprocated in Morocco, where the French convey the Russian legation’s correspondence. It would appear to me noteworthy that but little stress is laid in the protests against Russian action in Azerbaijan upon the fact that there is a steady growth of the purchase of landed property by Russians. Indeed, tbe fact that it is recognised that one of the abuses is the non-payment of the tax on land by Russian subjects, is almostCONFIDENTIAL. Sir W.

Russian reply is of inordinate length and disappointing. Considerable space is devoted to defence of Russia’s action, but arguments are weak and tone childish. Though no precise engagements are taken, it leaves it to be inferred that bhuja is to be sacrificed, and that collection of taxes by consuls is to be stopped. In telling me yesterday that I should receive reply m course of the evening, Minister for Foreign Affairs said he was giving us satisfaction on both the above- mentioned points as well as on that of the post-office, which he was prepared to abolish, and that he understood from letter he had received from London that these were the three questions to which we attached importance. I also gathered from what he said that practice of creating protected subjects will be discouraged. . , If Minister for Foreign Affairs has not given through Russian Ambassador in London more definite assurances with regard to all these questions than those contained in Russian aide-memoire, we ought, I think, to ask for them. If acquisi ion of lands by Russian subjects is to be continued, we might stipulate that agents oi the Persian Administration are not to be excluded from estates thus acquired, as has been the case at Ispahan. . . . , , i On my referring in our yesterday’s conversation to question of the neutral zone, Minister for Foreign Affairs said that, in concluding paragraph of his aide-memoire, he had put forward what he termed an “ amorce,” by which I understand him to mean an invitation for us to make proposals on the subject. . . nr j f ^ As his Excellency could not see me to-day, and as he is leaving on Monday lor the country, I shall not see him again till end of next week.

I SPOKE to the Russian Ambassador to-day about your Excellency’s telegram No. 130 of yesterday, recording that M. Sazonof had begun a conversation by a violent attack upon telegrams about Persia recently published in the “ Times.” I said that, as a matter of fact, when these telegrams appeared in the “ Times ” I had already come to the decision that I must discuss these Persian matters with the Russian Government, but the last thing I desired was that'the subject should be brought up in the press before I had done so. If therefore M. Sazonof thought that this was a press campaign inspired by me, I could assure him that this was the last thing that I desired at the moment. I also pointed out that M. Sazonofs idea, that the Persian Committee exercised influence over His Majesty’s Government, was quite wrong. The only influence that the Committee could exercise depended upon their power to influence public opinion, and this, in turn, depended on the material at their disposal. I did not understand M. Sazonof’s reference to German intrigues, unless he meant that German influence was brought to bear on the press in England, which might be the case, though I had no knowledge of it. I said that M. Sazonof’s idea that there was something behind all these attacks on Russia was quite wrong. I was even more upset about Persia than he was, because of the effect that the Russian proceedings in Persia might have on public opinion here. The Russian Ambassador pointed out that apparently concessions were being made, the Governor-General of Azerbaijan was to be changed, and Shuja was no longer to hold this post. I said that it was not so much a question of whether this or that Persian was Governor-General of Azerbaijan. It was a question of whether the Governor-General, whoever he was, was influenced by the Russian consul to act fairly and properly towards the Central Government in Tehran or whether he openly defied the Central Government. Count Benckendorff asked me what I thought was really needed in connection with Persia. I replied that I thought a closer grip over Russian representatives in Persia was needed, and an understanding in the Russian Foreign Ofhce that the effect of these various actions of Russian consuls in Persia was cumulative and must react upon the general political relations of Russia and the European situation. The representatives of any foreign country in any particular part of the world were apt to have a wrong perspective and to pursue particular objects in that one particular part of the world without realising the effect that their action might have on general policy. The essential thing was that the representatives and agents of a foreign Government in each part of the world should be made to subordinate their action to the requirements of general policy. Finally, I gave Count Benckendorff a paraphrase of my telegram to your Excellency, in which I had recorded my conversation with M. de Etter, and the memorandum, of which a copy is enclosed herein. I asked him to take this paper away with him and read as a statement of our position. When he had read it we could discuss the matter further. I had defended the sending of Russian troops into the north of Persia on the ground that the Anglo- Russian Agreement of 1907 must not be interpreted in a way that altered to her disadvantage the position of Russia in Persia as it existed in 1907 ; but it followed equally that the position in Persia should not be altered to our disadvantage ; and, when I looked at the other side of the shield, the British and not the Russian side, it was evident that the cumulative effect of all the events and of Russian action since 1907 had been to alter the situation to our disadvantage. Count Benckendorff promised to study the memorandum that I had given him. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. [2159 fc—1]^. O’.. t~r£h-A 16JUN19H:-!Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum communicated to Russian Ambassador, June 10, 1914. IN a recent conversation with Sir G. Buchanan, M. Sazonof alluded to the intentionO of the Russian Government to ask His Majesty’s Government to recognise more fully Russia’s predominant interests in northern Persia. Although such predominance of interest was fully recognised in the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1007, his Excellency thought the Russian Government had reason to complain that British consular officers in Persia did not always act in a manner conformable to such recognition in practice. He referred on this occasion more especially to the opposition which the British Legation at Tehran was alleged to have made to a Russian irrigation scheme at Ispahan. A separate memorandum will deal with this particular question. M. bazonof s complaint of the attitude of British agents in Persia was, however, of wider application, and he gave expression, not for the first time, to his dissatisfaction with the spint in which these agents are said to criticise the proceedings of the Russian consular authorities in the northern zone. His Excellency foreshadowed the presentation on his part of a note explaining in greater detail the view which the Russian Government took of the situation, and their proposals for meeting it. The promised note will it need hardly be said, be duly examined with the greatest interest and in the most friendly spirit. The British Government on their part are seriously concerned at the present position in Persia and the direction in which it is developing. Without, therefore, waiting for the receipt of M. Sazonof’s note, they think it right to place befoie the Russian Govern ment certain observations, inspired by their desire that the respective interests of the two countries in Persia should continue as hitherto to be frankly and amicably discussed between them. n • n i n i , In view of M. Sazonof’s recent remarks, it appears desirable to recall that the An^lo-Russian Agreement of 1907 was based upon the assumption of the independence and integrity of Persia. The division into three zones flowed from strategic rather than from political or commercial considerations, and in no sense did the agreement contemplate, or aim at, a political or administrative paitition of Peisia. Important events, however, which were not, and could not be, foreseen in 1907, have since occurred, bringing in their train, among other things, a military occupation of northern Persia by a Russian military force varying in numbers from 12,000 to 17,000 men, and the establishment of what amounts in practice to a Russian political protectorate over those regions. _ 7 , . . . . It would be difficult to describe in any other way the de facto administrative status of the northern provinces of Persia. The Persian governor-general at Tabriz is now to all intents and purposes an autonomous ruler. He pays no heed to the authority of the Central Government, and even at times issues orders in a sense contrary to their express instructions. The governor-general is, at the same time, entirely under the control of the Russian consulate-general, whose behests he implicitly obeys, and whose support alone prevents their protege from being called to account by his ovn Government. Again, Persian governors, as at Resht and Kazvin and at Julia (Ispahan), are piactically chosen, or, at any rate, maintained in their office, by the Russian consuls, and the condition of their remaining in office is that they must act as the Russian agents desire. The Central Government dare not dismiss them except with Russian consent, however rebellious, dishonest, or otherwise unsatisfactory their conduct. It will be remembered that the Russian Minister at Tehran recently brought about, on grounds closely connected with an instance of this nature, the resignation of the late Minister of the Interior, probably one of the least incapable and least inefficient officers of State m the country, and originally selected for his post on the strong recommendation of the Russian Government themselves. . r . ., _ r By the °rant of Russian protection to individuals, with all that this implies, m Azerbaijan, Meshed, and even as far south as Ispahan, the Russian administrative control is extended in great measure into the financial administration, which is at times seriously crippled thereby. In Azerbaijan instances have occurred where the major part of the taxes due from the very numerous Russian-protected persons have Been collected to the total exclusion of the Persian finance administration, by the Russian consuls, ’and by them lodged in the Russian Bank, without even an account being rendered of the moneys thus diverted from the Persian treasury, so that the nance o the province has been completely disorganised. , , , It is true that the Russian Government have not in set terms annexed the north of Persia but, on the contrary, have repeatedly disclaimed any intention of doing so.(S) [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.

Persian Legation, June 4, 1914. Enclosure in No. 1. Resume of Telegram received by Persian Legation from Persian Government. ACCORDING to reports continually received from Tabriz the Shuja-ed-Dowleh interferes with, the financial affairs of the province. He himself is about to collect the revenue of the province, and puts difficulties in the way of the officials of the Ministry of linance, and in some districts he has completely prevented these officials from doing their work. Owing to these circumstauces people refrain from paying their taxes. I he representatives of the Ministry of Finance sought the assistance of the Persian Cossack Brigade to collect the revenue, but the Cossack Brigade has replied that they w r ould only obey the orders of the Russian consul-general. The Persian Government have discussed these questions with the Russian Minister in Tehran, and have pointed out that if they have so far consented to retain Shuja-ed-Dowleh as Governor-General of Azerbaijan it was simply in view of the promises of the Imperial Russian Government that Shuja-ed-Dowleh would change his ways. If Shuja-ed-Dowleh did not rely on the support of the Russian Government he would not act as he does, and could not disobey the orders of the Central Government. I he attitude and the silence of the Imperial Russian Government is inconsistent with the assurances of good-will and co-operation which they always give. The Persian Government have again and most earnestly informed the Russian Government of their desire, and of the urgency of replacing Shuja-ed-Dowleh by another Governor-General—they are perfectly willing to send some one who would be agreeable to the Russian Government. And the Cossack Brigade must obey the orders of the Persian Government, and if the officials of the Ministry of Finance should at any time require their assistance they should give it at once. The Persian Government consented to the increase of the Cossack Brigade in Tabriz in order to make use of them when required, but if they act in the manner they do, what difference is there between them and the Russian Cossacks ? According to another report it appears that Russian post-offices are being established in Tabriz, and Russian postal officials have already arrived. How contrary such actions are to the assurances of good-will always given by the Russian Govern ment ; and such action is incomprehensible! The Russian Government must be urgently and earnestly asked to desist from such actions. June 4, 1914. [2159 e—7] Coev to triC;: a 9 JUU1914(Up) [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Matiesty s Government] I TRANSMIT to your Excellency herewith a copy of a minute by Sir E. Crowe relative to the present situation in Persia. As I informed your Excellency in my telegram No. 242 of the 4th instant, I M. DE ETTER again spoke to me to-day about the irrigation concession on the Karun which Russia is anxious to obtain for some of her subjects. He recalled that we had admitted no British rights would be infringed, and that the Russian Govern ment had accordingly asked for the support of our legation. Nevertheless the Persian Government was not giving the concession. I said that according to what we learnt from Tehran, nothing short of actual compulsion would induce the Persian Government to grant this concession to Russians, and no wonder. Speaking quite privately, and as a friend, I asked M. de Etter to try and place himself at the Persian point of view. The northern part of Persia, notably Azerbaijan, was now a Russian province ruled by Russian officials. The governor- general refused to acknowledge the authority of the Persian Government in any matter, and did so with the full approval of the Russian authorities. No Persian officials were allowed to collect taxes. These were levied by the Russian consuls and paid into the Russian bank, no accounts being even ever rendered. Land was under every kind of open illegality transferred to Russian immigrants by the square mile, whole villages and their outlying populations were taken formally under Russian ‘‘ protection, ^ which meant that for all practical purposes they ceased to be Persian subjects. Hie Cossack brigade paid for by the Persian Government was removed from theii conti ol the simple expedient of the officers declaring that they were under the orders of the Russian Minister of War. The Russian bank used its whole so-called banking machinery for substituting itself for the Persian Government administration and seducing what remained of loyalty to their Government of local chiefs and small people alike. # i n • n In this way Persia, whose integrity and independence the Russian Government had solemnly pledged themselves to uphold, had been shorn of hei most impoitant provinces. This Russian activity was now systematically pushing further south. It had become ominously prominent at Ispahan, where the Russian officials, consuls, bank, Cossacks, &amp;c., were repeating the same process with redoubled energy. I asked M. de Etter to say himself whether if he were the Persian Government he would gi’v e further extensive “ concessions ” to Russians in that region ? _ M. de Etter made no attempt whatever to deny or even palliate, least of all to defend, these Russian proceedings. I then continued, still asking him to treat what I said as private and coming from myself personally, that there was another even more important side to this question : that was the position of the British Government as a joint guarantor of Persia’s integrity and independence. I asked him to ppen his eyes and ears and judge for himself the strength and intensity of the feeling that was being aroused in this country at the utterly false position in which Plis Majesty s Government were being placed by the manner in which the Anglo-Russian agreement was in practice applied in Persia. / [A] PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA.

[2159 7*—3]I expressed my deep conviction that unless the situation was remedied, and that soon, the whole policy of Anglo-Russian friendship, on which His Majesty’s Govern ment had built, and which was the corner-stone of their foreign relations, would come to a disastrous end. I assured him that we in this office were getting thoroughly alarmed at the situation and felt that something radical must be done. The Russian^ Government had made all government of Persia impossible, and had undermined that State so effectively that it now began to look doubtful whether it could ever be expected to recover. We could not go on pretending to be blind ; however much we disliked complaining of the proceedings of Russian officials, the utter disregard of the whole principle on which the Anglo-Russian agreement respecting Persia rested, made it impossible for us to accept in silence the present situation and the certainty of its continuing to be changed in the same direction, to the utter discomfiture of every vestige of Persian authority in the country. M. de Etter listened with attention and sympathy, and finally said: he was well aware of the situation, he was sadly familiar with the disastrous effect produced on public opinion in this country ; he felt himself the absolute necessity of remedying this state of things, in the interest of our two countries ; and he would not only himself welcome, but would do all he personally could to bring about, a frank discussion of the difficulties which Persia was raising up between us, in order if possible to find a surer basis for that friendship and general political understanding which he knew his Government regarded as a vital Russian interest in the present time. M. de Etter said he did not propose to write home anything now of what I had said, but he was going to St. Petersburgh very shortly and he would there do his best to bring the situation home to those responsible for Russian policy and prepare the ground to the best of his ability for the proper consideration of a fresh departure and a more practical line of policy.

He said nothing about your conversation with Russian Charge d’Affaires, but spoke of the influence which the Persian committee exercise over His Majesty’s Government and of German intrigues. I told him that Russian consuls had of late been going rather too far and too fast. You were, I said, greatly preoccupied, as you could not defend in Parliament collection of taxes by Russian officials, who rendered no account for them to Persian Government, and who, moreover, settled, without the consent of the latter, financial claims of persons hostile to the Government. I also referred to actjonyoLRussian consul at Ispahan, in accordance with instructions contained in ynnr Yrfi gimiE Tiu 199 fy., and remarked that situation similar to that which had been created in' Azerbaijan was gradually being extended to Ispahan and the neutral zone. His Excellency disputed correctness of latter contention, and defended action of Russian consuls in collecting taxes on the ground that this course had been suggested by Mornard. He had had, he said, quite enough of these continual complaints about Russian consuls, and he would instruct them to refrain altogether from facilitating collection of revenue, and the Persian Government would not then receive a penny from these taxes. He was, he said, far more upset than you were about the situation, for he felt that there was something behind all these attacks on Russia. He had made great sacrifices to our friendship, but he could not go on doing so indefinitely. He was even sacrificing Shuja, though it would be impossible to find anybody to replace him. I remarked that Shuja might be useful to Russia, but that as he only obeyed the orders of the Russian consul-general, and ignored those of his own Government, he was undermining the principle of Persian independence.

Latter, his Excellency said, who had been in the Caucasus, was nothing better than a highway robber, and would never be allowed to set foot again in Russia. x\s the conversation was becoming somewhat heated, and as I had not yet submitted to him your latest proposals about Thibet, I suggested that we should postpone further discussion about Persia till you had given Russian Ambassador your proposed memorandum. His Excellency leaves again to-morrow night, but I am to see him before he starts to learn his views about Thibet. !o. 130.

[ pointed out that Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 was based upon independence and integrity of l ersia, and was not an agreement for its partition. The spheres of interest were for purposes of commercial concessions. The occupation of Northern Persia by Russian troops was technically a breach of Anglo-Russian Agreement, but I had always explained it by saying that we could not object in times of disorder to Russia taking measures essential to protect her trade and interests. ' displacement of the Belgian financial administration, the collection of taxes by Russian officials without rendering any accounts, the fact that the Governor- General of Azerbaijan took his orders from Russian officials and refused to acknowledge those of the Government at Tehran, could not be explained in the same way. I asked Russian Charge d’Affaires how Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs could himself possibly supply me with explanations that would reconcile these proceedings especially the interference with finance, with the basis of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1909 ? ^ &amp; . The mattei was made more serious by the fact that the same proceedings were beginning at Ispahan and spreading into the neutral zone. . 1 ^ as sure the Russian Government did not intend to sacrifice Anglo-Russian friendship to the collection of taxes in Persia, but this was what was bein 0, done. Anglo-Russian friendship here had hitherto had the support of the majority of both political parties, but I could not keep this if these proceedings continued. I told Charge d Affaires that I was having a memorandum prepared, and should take the matter up with Count Benckendorff on his return next week, and you need not therefore open the question at St. Petersburgh till you see Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs in the ordinary course unless it is mentioned to you. (Repeated to Tehran, No. 109.) [GOO—79]i V A (Immediato.) i India Office, Whitehall, JP O June 1914. Sir, • ' In forwarding for the information of the Secretary of State for-Foreign Affairs enclosed copfy of a telegram*' from the Government of India, the Secretary of State for India desires to offer the following observations upon the measures recom mended by them for the rehabilitation of British interests in South Persia. 2. The Marquess of Crewe agrees with the Government of India that these measures, initiated and carried out in the spirit which animates His Majesty’s Government, would not only be fully ■compatible with, but would tend actively to promote, the independence and integrity of Persia: But he is constrained to admit that they would not generally be so regarded, while they might easily furnish a pretext to the Russian Government for the initiation of similar measures in a contrary spirit. These considerations must be faced from the outset, but need not be deterrent. 3. It may be more difficult to reconcile the .proposed measures with the other obligations of His Majesty’s Government. It is obvious that they could not be undertaken without a previous under standing with Russia, and her probable attitude may be inferred from the reproach made in connexion with the Trans-Persian Railway, that His Majesty’s Government seemed to he seeking a monopoly (of railway construction) in the neutral sphere. Thus the whole question of the Con vention might be raised, and proposals for the enlargement of the British sphere be forced upon us. Copy fo India 3 JUL1914 4. As regards that r contingency. Lord Crewe shares tlie objections felt by the Government of India to raising the question of abolishing the neutral sphere. Apart from considerations of enlarged responsibilities, increased expense, and possible effect on Moslem sentiment, British com mercial and political interests are so distributed over the neutral sphere as to make relinquish ment of any portion of it to Russia difficult and hazardous. An examination of the map will render discus sion of this point superfluous, but it is clearly not probable that it will be accepted by Russia. The object of His Majesty’s Government should, there fore, be to secure our position in the Gulf and the The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office: S. 246.lands bordering On it without raising tho question of partition. 5. The first step which Lord Crewe wouldurge is the strengthening of our position in Arabistan. Whatever may be the ease in theory, there can be* ho doubt that the aaquisition by Bis Majesty’s- Government of a predominant share in the Anglo- Persian Oil Company has materially extended ouiv responsibilities in Western Persia, and it is fortunate that this has happened in a region in which our political interests are already deeply involved. The maintenance of the status quo in Arabistani has long been recognised as essential to our position in the Gulf, and recent developments have only emphasised that fact. But the course of events that is likely to ensue upon the death.- of Sheikh Khazal gives rise to some anxiety, and, in this conneetion I am to invite attention to, the letter from the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 3713, of 7th December 1913, and other correspondence sent to your department, on the IGth instant, and to the telegram* from the Govern ment of India, copy of which is enclosed. The case is stated with; such ability and cogency by. Sir P. Cox that detailed comment seems un necessary ; it isj however, for consideration whether the opportunity should not be used to obtain from the Sheikh of Mohammera. an undertaking similar to that given by the Sheikh of Koweit in the ■ Agreement of 23rd January 1899, binding him self, his heirs and successors not to cede, sell,, lease, mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to any foreign Power, or the subjects of any foreign Power, without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. Lord Crewe would propose, with Sir E. Grey’s concurrence, to instruct the Government of India to endeavour, ifi they see no objection, to obtain such an undertaking; but in any event, to give to the Sheikh, on the occasion of his investiture with the K.C.S.l.^ the enlarged assurance forming enclosure 2 in Captain Birdwood s letter, No. 467,. of 14th February last. 6. His Lordship would also recommend that, as proposed by the Government of India, action should be taken in the sense ©f paragraph 17 (6), (c), and (d) of Sir P. Cox’s letter, and at an early date. 7. Returning now to the Government of India’s telegram of the 11th instant, Lord Crewels of opinion that if the Sheikh of.Mohammera is thus fortitied, if. a clear and friendly understanding exists with the Bakhtiaris, and if at the same time the railway is pressed on to Dizful with the least possible delay— a measure to which lie attaches very great- importance—the effect is likely eventually to be felt in Luristan. But in the meantime the Anglo- Persian Company should be in a position to-^lefend itself against tribal attacks, and Lord Crewe 'would suggest that it should be required to maintain, at its own expense, a corps of local levies. 8. '1'lie subsidy recently renewed to the Tigris .and Euphrates Navigation Company should suffice to secure that Company against Messrs. Wbnckhaus’ encroachments on the Karim for the next two years, during which it is hoped that the new •directorate may see lit to adopt more active and business-like methods for the furtherance of its business ; and Lord Crewe is of opinion that the measures above indicated, taken together, will sufficiently safeguard the position of Great Britaki in this most important region. 9. In southern Persia His Lordship attaches primary importance to securing a lease of the islands at the mouth of the Gulf, and to pressing forward with as little delay as possible negotiations with Kussia that will permit of the construction of a railway inland from Bunder Abbas. But as regards the latter he is unable to recommend that any further concessions should be made in respect of an alignment east of that place, or of British predominance on the southern section and in the port itself; and he would ask whether it is impossible, irrespective of these negotiations, to arrange with the Persian Government for the commencement of the southern survey. Such a measure, which would seem to be justified by the fact that the Persian Railways Syndicate liave a claim on His Majesty’s Government prior to that of the Societe, in respect of a line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, might serve to bring the Russian Government to a more speedy decision. If the survey is undertaken Lord Crewe would urge that it should be under the protection of a British escort. Its operations will be in districts that have not yet been policed by the Swedish gendarmerie, which is notoriously undermanned. 10. The question of this gendarmerie is one of great difficulty. Lord Crewe has hitherto supported the Swedish officers, not because he felt great confidence in their eventual success, but because he realised the grave political objections to the substitution of British officers. The course of events has neither increased his confidence nor diminished the objections; but without endorsing Sir \Y. Townley’s opinion as to the success that has actually been achieved, so far as the south is concerned, be is impressed by the con siderations advanced in the Minister’s telegram N T o. 181, of the 19th instant, and recognises that the coronation of the young Shah is the worst possible moment for a change of policy that could hardly fail to throw the new Government into opposition to British interests. Such a step too, would, he thinks, be likely to endanger the success of the programme outlined above, which pre-4u supposes a'certain Amount of good wrlf on'4lie part of the Persian Government. If therefore, Sir E. Grey approves this' programme, and .there is a reasonable probability of carrying it out, Lord Crewe is of'opinion that His Majesty’s Government could afford to tolerate the Swedish regime in Ears and Kerman for another year at all events, and to continue.to advance funds for the purpose. But he considers it essential (1) that the advances should be administered under the supervision of His Majesty’s Minister, and should, not be used out side Ears and Kerman; (2) that the Swedish Government should be pressed not to agree to an} 7 modification of the contracts with the new officers in the directions indicated an Sir W. Townley’s telegram of 18th May, and to see that only first-class officers are sent; ' (3); that the Persian* Government should; be urged to instruct the Swedish officers that their first duty is to maintain order on the roads to the coast, and that it should be impressed both on that Government and on the Swedish Government, that inasmuch as the gendarmerie owes its continued existence solely to British money and support, British interests and commerce have a claim upon its services, second only to its obligation of loyalty to Persia; (4) that orders for supplies in Ears and Kerman should be placed with British and Indian firms. The last is, perhaps, a small matter in itself, but it appears to his Lordship to be one in which His Majesty’s Minister should feel bound to exercise a special degree of watchfulness in behalf of British and- Indian commerce. In return for this concilia tory attitude’, (the continuance of which, however, should be understood! to be .conditional upon a marked improvement in 4he efficiency of the force), His Majesty’s Government would expect amenability on the part of the &gt; Persian Government in respect of the lease of the islands and other matters men tioned above. 11. Lord Crewe puts forward these suggestions with a sincere desire to avoid a radical departure from the traditional policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment in Persia. But he realises that, even if they are successfully carried out, they are the minimum that is required for the maintenance of British interests, and that they must be supplemented by a firmer resistance of all attempts to push Russian influence south of Ispahan than the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention may, perhaps, be held to justify. If they prove impracticable, he sees no alternative to a revision of that instrument, with all the disagreeable contingencies that may ensue.

Sir, In forwarding for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs enclosed copy of a telegram from the Government of India, the Secretary of State for India desires to offer the following observations upon the measures recom mended by them fpr the rehabilitation of British interests in South Persia. The Marquess of Crewe agrees with the Govern ment of India that these measures, initiated and carried out in the spirit which animates If is Majesty’s Government, would not only be fully compatible with, but would tend actively : to promote, the independence and integrity of Persia. But he is constrained to admit that they would not generally be so regarded, while they might easily furnish a pretext to fhe Russian Government for the initiation of similar measures in a contrary spirit.

But in His Lordship’s opinioh. the main difficulty in a partition of the neutral sj’Jmre lies in the/facty that British commercial and ponKcal interests are so distributed over it that then portion of it that can safely be relinquished &amp; 245.&lt;&gt;* An examination of the map^jll render discussion, of this point superfluous, ^ it is clearly •not probable that it will be accepted by Russia..

Subject has had our earnest consideration. \\ e realise that while we have scrupulously observed our obligations, the Russian Government and their oilicials in Persia have practically ignored their formal engagements to respect integrity and independence of Persia. Yet we are convinced that, but for Convention and the restraining influence of His Majesty’s Legation, independence and integrity of Persia would, long ago, have been swept aside, and that our best interests still lie in the steadfast maintenance of Convention, as long as possible, consistently with preservation of our commercial and political predominance in the neutral and British spheres. We are aware that since the Convention this predominance has suffered considerably on the mainland, mainly owing to conditions of rampant anarchy, which resulted from Nationalist movement. On the other hand, our position in the Gulf has, in the meantime, been considerably consolidated, and if current proposals for acquisition of certain islands take shape it will be practically unassailable ; to this measure we attach greatest importance. We recognise that specific measures are necessary to recover lost ground on land, and with that end in view we strongly advocate replacement of Swedes by British officers for employment with gendarmerie on the trade routes in Southern Persia. In addition to this there are other feasible measures of peaceful penetration which would tend to consolidate our position, such as— (1) Organisation of local levies for protection of railway survey and working parties in Luristan, and similar measures for sites for oil works and pipe-line in which we are now so strongly interested. (2) Exercise of controlling influence over tribal chiefs as advocated in my telegram of 11th June in the case of Soulet and Kawam. (3) Construction of railways under British auspices from coast to plateau. All these measures are connected witli our vested interests in the South ; are compatible with integrity and complete independence of Persia, and could give Russia no reasonable ground for complaint having regard to manner in which she deals with her own interests in the North. As regards proposed increase in our sphere in connection with probable railway alignment we are of opinion that it has no advantage except in tiiat connection, and that no quid pro quo should be given for it beyond our acquiescence in Mahdiabad-Bunder Abbas alignment. In any case as there is apparently a hitch in Trans-Persian railway negotiations, there would seem to be no urgency about this matter, and we are of opinion that it would be better to postpone suggestion of it as being calculated to raise general question of abolition of neutral zone. Referring to Note of recognition that Russia desires from us, mentioned in our telegram of 21st May in connection with Tibet negotiations, we are at a loss to understand how, short of annexation of Azerbaijan Russia’s position in the North could be more predominant than it is or what she wants more. While the above are our views as to directions in which our interests lie we do not overlook contingency that modification of Convention may at any time be forced upon us by Russia’s action in the North. \\ e wish to make it plain, however, that we regard abolition of neutral zone as a measure attended by most portentous objections and reiterate our conviction that we should avoid it as long as possible. Amongst these objections would be enormous cost ; hostile Mohammedan opinion ; doubtful attitude ol Germany.From Viceroy, 19th June 1914. Foreign Secret. Sheikh of Mohammerah. Please see Pushire letter No. 3713, dated 7th December 1913, regarding aspirations of Sheikh. In view of fact that we have always endeavoured to meet Sheikh’s wishes as much as possible owing to large development of British interests in Arabistan, his wishes for modification of assurances should, we consider, be acceded to. We accordingly recommend issue of revised assurances as contained in draft letter forwarded with Bushire letter No. 467, 14th February, copy of which was enclosed in Cox’s weekly letter to Hirtzel, 12 M., 19th March. This we think would serve the purpose indicated in paragraph 14 [paragraph 15 in India Office print], clause 1, of Bushire letter of 7th De cember 1913 referred to above. Sheikh would no doubt appreciate it greatly if we gave him this fresh assurance simultaneously with bestowal of decoration on ^King’s birthday, and we request permission to do so confidentially. With regard to clause 2, paragraph 14 [paragraph 15 in India Office print], of that letter, we are of opinion there would be no harm in making friendly communication to Bakhtiaris in the manner suggested in paragraph 16 (d) [ paragraph 17 in India Office print]. In regard to clause 3 of paragraph 14 [paragraph 15 in India Office print] of same letter, the action suggested in paragraph 16 [paragraph 17 in India Office print] (b) and (c) would undoubtedly place Mohammerah situation on a satisfactory footing, and an opening or even a necessity for taking it may conceivably arise in the course of explanations which Ills Majesty s Government may contemplate making to Russian and Persian Governments regarding our action in acquiring predominant share in Anglo-Persian Oil C0 Xt both the expediency of course proposed and the juncture for taking them seems matter rather for consideration between His Majesty’s Govern ment and His Majesty representatives concerned.4 From Viceroy, 2\st May 1914. (Not repeated to Peking.) .Foreign Secret, libet. Please refer to your Lordship’s telegram of 20th May. Condition No. 1. McMahon lays great stress upon undesirability of deleting Clause X., in which Russia appears to have no direct interest. Although this Article is not of great intrinsic importance to us any change in initialled text would, in his opinion, open door to a renewal of discussions which China would welcome, and, in view of information which has reached him to-day from confidential Chinese sources, he believes that consent of China to signature of Agreement could scarcely be hoped for should such a loophole be oftered. We share his view, and consider that any opening for further discussion of the text would be likely to wreck Agreement. Condition No. 2. We agree to exchange of notes and proposed Russian secret note. Condition No. 3. We agree to exchange of notes and secret note, but we understand that although the designation of our Agent is to be com mercial he will not be debarred from carrying out duties as defined by Article VIII. Proposed note to Russian Government regarding Northern Afghanistan presents no serious objection, since it does not prevent Amir from giving a concession to a British subject should he wish to do so. But when published it would be liable to be misunderstood by Amir and to arouse general comment. If it is impossibie to arrange that note should be secret, we trust that we may be allowed time to communicate it to Amir with suitable explanation before publication. As regards proposed note relating to Persia we consider that matter has nothing to do with Tibetan arrangement and should be treated independently and separately. 1 do not gather that our immediate views are desired upon the proposed note, but while deprecating any strengthening of the Russian position in Northern Persia as tending to the disruption of Persia, we could not agree to ■mdfcuJ- suc h a/change in the North without similar recognition of British interests in South.Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 19, 2'5 p.m.) Tehran, June 19, 1914. (No. 181.) (June 19, 3 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 4 to Stockholm of 18th June. If the Swedish Government persist in their intention to recall the military mission lent to Persia for the purpose of organising a gendarmerie, we shall find ourselves here in a precarious and almost desperate situation at a moment when the young Shah is about to ascend the throne. I had yesterday most satisfactory proofs that the Shah and some of the more enlightened of his entourage are fully conscious of the onerous duties which await His Majesty, and that he and his younger advisers, amongst the ablest of whom is a son of the late Mozaffereddin Shah, have been discussing seriously and intelligently the qualities of the various public men best suited to form a Cabinet after the Coronation. I was not aware till yesterday that the Shah was taking such a serious interest in the future of his country. Persons who have been brought into contact with him lately, including my wife on her return from Europe, have been struck with the marked advance in him from a fat shy boy to a thinking youth. He also now speaks French fluently, and does not require the services of an interpreter. I gathered that Shah does not mean to be swayed by the advice of men like Kamran Mirza and the old reactionary party. It would be hard if a boy sovereign who shows promise should be confronted by such a situation as would be created by the withdrawal of the Swedes. Who, and what, is to take their place, and how are the 7,000 gendarmes who would be left without officers to be centrolled ? British officers would certainly be as distasteful to Persia as Russians, and, I am convinced, that the} 7 could only be imposed on Persia by some drastic measure such as an ultimatum or a bribe in the shape of money to finance the administration. Treasurer- General has often told me that he would go if the Swedes do, as his administration could no more work with British officers than with Russians. I would beg once more to place on record my firm conviction that the Swedes can yet succeed if a fair chance is given them, and if they are genuinely supported. They have fardts but they have done good yeoman work. All impartial persons capable of judging the situation are unanimous in their praise of the result achieved when viewed as a whole. The only alternative, unless it is proposed to let Persia again make a trial of governing herself by her old methods, is British officers in the south and Russians in the north. Such an arrangement would lead to partition in some form which in addition to many other drawbacks would eventually prove much more costly to British taxpayer than a few hundred thousand pounds advanced to Persia at a remunerative rate of interest.

Sazonof’s statement respecting position in Russian sphere of influence is as misleading as it is inaccurate, as his Excellency must have been well aware. If it is intended that use of expression “ north and south of Persia ” in the discussions about radius of action of gendarmerie should mean that north equals Russian zone and south equals neutral and British zones, it will be found that out of a total strength of about 6,000 gendarmes two-thirds are employed in Russian sphere of influence as against one-third who are employed in neutral and British spheres—namely, in Shiraz and Kerman districts. The much vaunted quiet and prosperity of Russian sphere is entirely due, as far as such parts of it are concerned in which there are no Russian troops, to the efforts of the gendarmes, who have restored order on the roads from Resht to beyond Kum, and from thence on to Sultanabad and from Kazvin to Hamadan, whilst all the district round Tehran is now perfectly quiet, and such brigands as Naib Hussein of Kashan, who laughed at a Persian Cossack force sent against him, and robbed and disarmed a party of Russian soldiers on another occasion, are, out of fear of the gendarmes, endeavouring to make peace with the Government, and are suing for permission to go to Kerbela. It is conceivable that M. Sazonof does not know that roads from Tehran to Meshed and from Hamadan to Kermanshah and Turkish frontier are in Russian sphere, but it is inconceivable that he should not know that their state of insecurity is only equalled by that of Luristan in the neutral zone and of Kurdistan in the Russian zone. When one considers the work that Swedish officers have done with some three or four thousand raw Persian levies, one cannot but smile at M. Sazonof’s self-satisfaction that some 10,000 Russian regulars have kept order in Azerbaijan whilst allowing brutal atrocities to be perpetrated by their puppet Shuja under their very noses, and consequently with their tacit approval. t To trot out the German bogy as a reason for not increasing Swedes is farcical. Beyond the fact that they are ^better soldiers, more methodical, and much more hard-working than their Russian fellows, they have made no displa} r of German tendencies except in their acceptance of hospitalities of German Minister, and have never had a word with any Russian authority. Such excuses can only be intended to cloak the real design, which is to prevent Persia from developing a force which may be capable of bringing about her rehabilitation, and to replace Russian troops by a force bound to Russian interests which will not act counter to -infant policy of absorption pursued by ^ Russian consuls, who make nse of Russian troops and Persian Cossacks to intimidate such Persians as may have the courage to refuse to make over their lands to Russian subjects or protected persons. This system of colonisation is being carried out on a laige scale at the present moment in the frontier region between Astrabad and Meshed, where a large Russian immigration is proceeding. _ ., „ . Persian Ministers refuse to see their folly in preferring Russian tioops paic or y Russia to Russian troops under a Persian name paid for by themselves. Doubtless if M. Sazonof had a hint of this the threat, already used when increase of Cossack detachment at Tabriz was demanded, would again be made, namely that Persia must for the future pay for Russian army of occupation. 1 t oioug i le orm of Cossack brigade is a deception; the force would always remain a weapon of coercion in the hands of Russian consuls. f - ' ' 26 MAR 1914! f [32i-354jAfter russification of military forces would come thatj of financial administration. Already new Russian Minister lias urged, from behind his favourite screen of “ personal opinion,” that Treasurer-General should have Russian financial agents in the north Position of Gre at Brit ain i n Per sia has suffere d eno rmously si nce .signing of conv entioi^ of 1907, how much only those who ha ve long known the couiitry can realise . British trade has been practically driven out of Ispahan, is non-existent north of that city, once the cradle of British commerce in Persia, and is rapidly losing ground at Hamadan and places east of that important centre. This result is not alone due to disturbed state of southern roads, but also to the fact that roads north and east of towns named have been rendered safe for passage of Russian goods, not by Russian troops, but by gendarmes under Swedish officers. M. Sazonof is either so blind to Russian interests, or so intent upon his plan for swallowing Persia against his will, that he does not see what his half-German Swedes have done for Russia. I would venture to repeat that I am of opinion that British national honour demands that whatever Persian force may be used in neutral and British spheres should be put under British officers if forces employed in Russian sphere are to be under Russian officers. The gravity of the situation must be the excuse for the length of this telegram.A CONFIDENTIAL. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 15, 11 p.m.) St. Petersburgh, March 15, 1914. (No. 71.) (March 15, 8 ’25 p.m.) IN the course of a long and friendly conversation yesterday 1 spoke to Minister for Foreign Affairs in the terms of your telegram No. 132 , reading him some of the more important passages. 1 also reminded him of the services rendered by the gendarmerie on the Hamadan-Kazvin road, to which reference was made in Tehran telegram No. 84 . '(fi The attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs was at first very uncompromising. He disputed the necessity of the proposed increase, and said we must not ask him to consent to the employment of gendarmerie in the Russian sphere. North Persia was quiet and prosperous, thanks to the presence of Russian troops, and the introduction of a new force under Swedish officers, who were half Germans, might lead to unfore seen conflict with the Russian authorities. I replied that the Russian troops could not remain permanently there, and the Persian Government ought to be allowed to provide for the maintenance of order now that it had the means of doing so, thanks to the Swedish officers, who simply did the above-mentioned duty without any political bias. A refusal on his Excellency’s part would mean that Russia intended to govern North Persia as she was doing at present. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that we equally governed South Persia through our consuls. I said that, though our influence was predominant there, we were pursuing the constructive policy of helping the Persian Government to maintain order and administer the country through its own instruments, whereas the policy of the Russian consuls aimed at destroying the authority of the4? Persian Government! and creating a state of things which would render the withdrawal of the Russian troops impossible. On his Excellency’s declaring that Russia had already withdrawn some of her troops, 1 asked whether any had been withdrawn from Kazvin. He replied that decision had been taken and he did not understand delay, but he would make enquiries. He added that the presence of Turkish troops near the frontier rendered it impossible for Russia to withdraw her troops from the frontier districts. He had repeatedly told me that Russia had no intention of annexing any part of Persian territory/ I said that I placed implicit confidence in the sincerity of his Excellency’s assurances, but that I feared that unless Russia seconded the efforts now being made by the Persian Government and helped them to build up national administration in the north of Persia, circumstances would prove too strong for her, and annexation would ^ sooner or later be inevitable. His Excellency often reproached Indian public^vilH unwarranted suspicions of Russia, but I feared that knowledge of policy pursued by Russian consuls in North Persia would tend to strengthen these suspicions^ Minister for Foreign Affairs, after remarking that Indian public opinion knew nothing about the Russian consuls, said he would make us the sacrifice of five more Swedish officers for the south. I replied that this was not a, sacrifice [group omitted: ? such] as we [group omitted : ? would make] if we wished to occupy the country with our troops, as Russia was doing in the north, ^ and I again appealed to him to consent to their employment all over Persia, pointing out how difficult it would be for you to [? explain] his refusal. His Exceffency, however, absolutely refused to do so, saying that the Cossack brigade must be extended and used in f? north]. On my remarking that the force was very inefficient and its officers anything but competent, his Excellency said that it must be thoroughly reorganised. He was ready to consent to its being made more dependent on the 1 ersian Govern- [322—276]2 ment and to necessary reforms being introduced as regards conditions, pay, &amp;c. The Persian Government, he added, were very foolish in not consenting to its extension, as they were but delaying the withdrawal of the Russian troops. On my enquiring whether his consent to the employment of five more Swedish officers for the south was given unconditionally, and without reference to increase in Cossack brigade, his Excellency gave me to understand that it was only conditional on their not being employed in the north. I told him that I feared you vould be much disappointed with his decision. } . . I feel it useless for me to attempt to overcome his Excellency s opposition, and that all we can do is to insist on the thorough reform of the Cossack brigade.CONFIDENTIAL. A | (No. 133.)

Almost the first operations undertaken by gendarmerie were upon Kazvin-Hamadan road, which js in the northern, or Russian, zone. Gendarmerie post has been in existence at Ivazvin for more than two years. Most friendly relations have been maintained between Swedish and Russian officers there, and, as has been shown by recent reports from British ^ ce- consul at Hamadan, Russian trade has benefited largely from good order preserved on the road at the expense of British trade, which has been handicapped by the troubled state of the roads to the west of Hamadan.

R. ^ (March 12, 1215 p.m ) CONSIDERABLE comment lias been aroused here by report of an interview accorded by the Russian Minister to a reporter of an opposition newspaper. The Russian Minister says that his remarks have been reported correctly. Chief points touched upon were :— 1. Russian Policy in Persia. —The Russian Minister stated that he could not say definitely what is the policy of Russia, but he had been instructed to strengthen friendly relations between the two Governments, to help the progress and independence of Persia, and to further the reforms inaugurated. He added that divergent views existed in Russia upon Persian question, but that the Russian Government held that necessary assistance must be given to the Persian Government to enable them to conduct their own affairs. 2. Employment of Russian Troops in North. —The Russian Minister said that he considered Russian troops should be withdrawn. The Emperor of Russia had expressly instructed him in this sense, as also had the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whilst the Governor-General of the Caucasus shared the same view. Evacuation would be begun at Kazvin, from which place all the troops would be withdrawn by the end of April, leaving only a small consular guard. 3. The ex-Shah.—The Russian Minister stated that, when at St. Petersburgh recently, the ex-Shah was told categorically that he must put all idea of returning to Persia out of his head, and that the Russian Government would not assist him. 4. Russian Policy and Persia’s Constitution .—The Russian Minister said that only in the event of a recrudescence of disorders would Russia make amendments of a nature to secure a suitable constitutional system. 5. Convention of 1907.—The Russian Minister said that time alone could show if it would work iu Persia’s interests. All depended on the attitude of Ministers, who jeopardised their country’s future by their differences among themselves. 6. Neutral Zone. —This was created, the Russian Minister said, because in 190i a certain distrust of each other existed between the British and Russian Governments. 7. Gendarmerie .—The Russian Minister pointed out that the conditions under which this force was created had altered. W hat was intended to be a small force to keep order on the roads 'was growing into a national army. He was not opposed to this augmentation, but the question must be considered afresh by the Go\ernments interested 8. Loan .—This question depended, the Russian Minister consideied, on two considerations — elaboration of a budget, and building of railways. As to the former M. Mornard had told him that, if the two Governments made an imme diate advance to Persia to enable him to pay salaries and pensions, he could draw up a proper budget in two years. If the railway question were settled, a large loan 9. Trans-Persian Railway. —Russian Minister said that the only hitch between England and Russia was due to the desire of the former that hne should go from north-west to south and Persian Gulf, whereas Russia wished it to go more to the 1 la The Treasury and Russian Opposition in [r] --Persian Government had complained of this, but he believed that much of the trouble arose Horn the fact that 1322-239the system under which land tax is now levied is a novel one. He expressed his surprise that persons under Russian protection had come to him and said that they need not pay tax on their estates. 11. Azerbaijan .—Russian Minister said he had received no definite instructions^ on this question, but that his Government was friendly towards Shuja because, aftei the years of confusion, he was the only man who had been able to maintain order in the province. He could give no opinion on question of his dismissal, as there had been no official communication about it from Persian Government.CONFIDENTIAL Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan (St. Petershurgh). (N°. 132.) , u i^ Foreign Office, March 12, 1914, 4*20 p.m. PERSIAN gendarmerie. ( u&gt; y Sir W. Townley’s telegram No. 82 of 10th March. I trust that the friendly discussions between Sir W. Townley and his Russian colleague will facilitate a satisfactory arrangement, but it seems to me necessary to remove all possible misapprehension as to the position in Persia and our attitude towards it. 1 he opeiations of the Swedish-officered gendarmerie are at present practically restncted to the south, where the force is doing excellent work, having regard to the inadequate numbers of officers and to other difficulties. His Majesty s (joyernment do not understand on what possible grounds the Russian Government can in iairness claim a right to withhold their assent to the increase of the Swedish staff, which is absolutely necessary if order is to be re-established and main tained in the south. The maintenance of order is the first duty of the Persian Government, and to prevent the Persian Government from taking such measures would be tantamount to saying that the prevalence of disorder in the south is a Russian interest. 1 do not believe for a moment that Russian Government would think of acting on such a view. It must be remembered that the interruption of trade routes in the south excludes British trade from the neutral sphere, and that for Russia to oppose measures such as extension of Swedish gendarmerie, which are necessary to keep open those trade routes, is in practice to give Russian trade greater opportunities than British of entering the neutral sphere. British traders already complain that this is the effect of present conditions. His Majesty’s Government consider, therefore, that the Persian Government must be free to engage a sufficient number of Swedish officers to enable the gendarmerie to carry out their paramount duties This is due to Persia and essential to enable [British trade to compete on equal terms in the neutral sphere. British interests are thus directly involved. His Majesty’s Government must ask the Russian Government to consider whether opposition to the organisation of the only possible effective police force in those regions is compatible with the policy of Anglo-Russian co-operation and friendship. His Majesty’s Government on their part have at the cost of much parliamentary trouble in this country loyally refrained from putting difficulties in the ■way of Russia in upholding her interests in the north of Persia, precisely because they have always recognised that Russia has a vital interest in the preservation of order and repression of lawlessness in the north. But His Majesty’s Government must ask that British interest in the maintenance of order in the south should be correspondingly recognised, and they cannot agree that Russia has a right to make the maintenance of order there impossible except in return for special concessions to herself. The question of the employment of the Swedish gendarmerie in the north is a separate one. Whilst the Persian Government ought not to be hampered in using their own police forces to keep order in any part of their own country, His Majesty s Government readily admit that Russia’s special position in the north entitles her to ask that extension of sphere of operations of the gendarmerie to those regions should be discussed with her. So far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, the} would be prepared to support an arrangement by which the gendarmerie would be employed on the roads in the five northern provinces, whilst simultaneous!} the force of Persian Cossacks under Russian officers were increased. This should, however, in fairness, be subject to the proviso that certain important reforms in the constitution and administration of the Cossack brigade are carried out, which a competent authorities, including, it is believed, the Russian Legation at lehran, 1322 - 251 j■ recognise to be absolutely necessary if the Cossacks al , e , 0 f “thfehlh police force They were originally organised as the personal bodyguard ot the b c .

T \ * (March 10, 4 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 41 of 28th February : Gendarmerie and Cossacks. I have discussed question at great length and with absolute frankness, both with the Russian Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Former is unwilling to commit himself to any definite suggestion, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the C abinet would never consent, except under great pressure, to the permanent stationing of Cossack detachments in any towns but Tehran and Tabriz. Russlans , request that in return for their consent to the engagement of five additional Swedish officers the Cossack brigade should be increased has been answered in this sense. Russian Minister, after asking for plain answer, now complains that Persia’s reply is a point-blank refusal of Russia’s request, though worded in conciliatory language, and only consented to transmit its contents to St. Petersburgh after the Minister for Foreign Affairs had agreed that he would again lay before his colleagues question of Cossacks being established in the north if the necessity should arise. Russian Minister told me last night that, unless Persian Government agreed to this in principle, he is convinced that Russian Government will oppose all increase in number of Swedish officers, but he expressed his opinion that the Russian Government could not justifiably oppose employment of gendarmerie throughout Persia, since no restriction was made when the force was created, and thought that, if His Majesty’s Government urged Persian Government to agree to the establishment of Cossacks in certain places in five northern provinces, the Russian Government woidd waive their objection to gendarmes being employed on the roads in those provinces. I pointed out to him that it seemed to me most unfair that the development of a force which had proved its value should be hampered by such a condition, but I promised to lay the matter before you for your favourable consideration. It does seem hard to take advantage of the situation to impose a distasteful condition on Persia, but it appears to be clear that some concession will have to be made in order to remove Russian opposition, and if it is established that the gendarmerie can be employed on the roads throughout the country, the Cossacks, beyond the fact that their increase will entail useless and unnecessary expense upon the Exchequer, will possibly not do much harm.^RSIA AND CENTRAL ASJA. | [February 28.J CONFIDENTIAL.

The Russian Minister replied that of course there is no foundation for such tales ; that he could not see that disorders here could be in Russia’s interests ; that any new troops that might have come in were merely to replace time-expired men; and that his latest advices from Kazvin showed that a large number of men were preparing to start.

In answer to a request for my views on the subject, I said that it seemed to me possible that an arrangement might be made, if the Russian Government considered that such an unsatisfactory force as the Cossacks is essential to the welfare of Russian interests, under which the brigade can have detachments in certain places in the five provinces, whilst the policing of the roads is entrusted throughout the country to the gendarmerie. # . .

Tehran, February 7, 1914. I HAA E the honour to report that I had a long and interesting conversation with M. Korostovetz, the new Russian Minister, this afternoon. In reply to his enquiry as to my views upon the present political situation, I said that it seemed to me to be much in its usual state, a good deal of uncertainty, due in no small measure to the intrigues of those in office among themselves, and of those out of office who are anxious to get in. On the whole, I added, the position appeared to me a fairly sound one, such as could be still maintained for several months, provided that our two legations worked loyally and cordially together in such a manner as to give similar advice to the Government on any important question. M. Korostovetz seemed a little surprised when I told him that the two legations have virtually governed Persia for some time past, since the Ministers take no action without consulting us. For this reason, I said, it was most desirable that we should be quite frank with each other in our exchanges of views even at the risk of occasionally finding ourselves on thin ice. M. Korostovetz most cordially agreed. M. Korostovetz here enquired if I thought that the present Cabinet could continue in office after the Shah had ascended the throne, and whether, in the event of it being found impossible to elect members for a Medjliss, the coronation would have to be postponed. I answered that in Persia one must watch the course of events and seize the opportunities that might present themselves. The maintenance of the present Cabinet must, I thought, depend in no small measure upon the composition and views of the new Medjliss, if one was formed. I added that it would be essential, in my opinion, that a sound and reliable adviser should be found to guide the young Shah s early footsteps. M. Korostovetz agreed, and seemed to have no doubt that a Medjliss could be elected, and that it would probably prove a better one than the last. I said that I much hoped that this might be the case, but that I feared that there would, however well a new Medjliss might start, be opposition to the foreign institutions, when once the new Assembly felt its power. I then, at his request, sketched rapidly the characters of the leading personalities, explaining as concisely as possible the reasons why the Regent does not like to have men of marked personality, either on account of their position, prestige, or intellect, about him. His Highness, I showed, much prefers men of a lesser calibre who cannot compete with himself, his otherwise sound views being unfortunate y somewhat obscured by his regard for his own position and future. 1 pointed out that “ se ]f ” plays such a large part in the policy of each individual statesman that it is almost impossible to hope for a homogeneous Cabinet. This unlucky characteristic caused public and private individuals in Persia to be especially prone to speak ill ot each other, and to spread stories likely to prejudice the neighbour. In speaking of Ain-ed-Dowleh, I said that I had reason to believe that the Russian Legation was not at the present moment very well disposed towards him, but reminded M. Korostovetz that His Highness had been included m the Cabinet solely at M. Poklewsky’s instigation, and that the same influence had exerted itself to patch up a nine-vears-old quarrel between the Prince and His Majesty s Legation. I had oun His Highness a most capable and useful Minister to whose personal influence I attributed no small share in the improved conditions that had been established in ose parts of Persia in which British interests are specially engaged. 1 expressed a hope that he would not listen too readily to tales that he might hear about the Prmce v l o has many enemies who cannot forgive him the haughty bearing he assumes towards men who are his colleagues and equals under the Constitution, but who were formerly no more than his paid clerks. „ , ? • n M. Korostovetz spoke at some length about the question of the zones of that had been created under the 1907 agreement, and appeared to favour rather [2063 i—9]■Avm 1 ,v strongly the idea that the sort of “ no-man’s-land,’’ known as the neutral zone, had been proved a failure after an experience of seven years, and should now disappear. He considered that, although Russia had no intention whatever to penetrate into regions in which British interests are paramount, this sort of “ terrain vague ” on the_ southern frontier of the Russian zone must always remain a source of danger to our gooc /&gt; relations, because consular politicians are after all human beings, and it is too much to expect them to be so far above the frailty of mankind as to resist the temptation to acquire some possible kudos by pushing Russian interests a little larther south than may be entirely legitimate, seeing that there is nothing in the 1907 agreement which pjohibits such action. Though much hoping that such would never be the case, he feared that any day a delicate question might arise out ot what appeared to him, a new-comer, an unsatisfactory situation. I expressed my entire participation in his fears, and took occasion to call his attention to the fact that it had been quite recently reported to me that the Russian agents at Ispahan are becoming extremely active, and would appear to be adopting the regrettable methods employed at Tabriz and elsewhere in the north, under which persons who have no sort of claim to it are accorded Russian protection, for themselves and properties. This was started, I added, by the success of the arrangement under which the manager of the Russian Bank at Ispahan had become the administrator of the properties of the Zil-es-Sultan. As had been seen during the recent disturbances at Ispahan, certain disaffected persons had become much emboldened by the possession of a measure of Russian protection, and I had heard with regret from our acting consul- general that Russian agents are very busy acquiring the protection of their consulate for villages situated near Ispahan which can have no well-founded claim to such protection, which sometimes carries with it, among other advantages, immunity from paying taxes. He must not be surprised, I said, if some soreness is apparent at Ispahan, where British residents have witnessed the practical ousting of British trade from a town that might be considered the cradle of British commerce in Persia by Russian goods, thanks to the force of circumstances rather than to the superexcellence of the rival wares. _ M. Korostovetz said that he had discussed this question of the obliteration of the neutral zone with Count Benckendorlf at St. Petersburgh, and had gathered from his Excellency that His Majesty’s Government are opposed to any revision of the agreement of 1907 at the present moment. 1 pointed out that we had hardly got our fair share in 1907 and that it would be hard to revise the agreement in the sense of suppressing the neutral zone, since our legitimate and old-established rights there gave us a justifiable claim to the whole of it. M. Korostovetz appeared to consider this no serious obstacle, and seemed even to think that there would be no great objection to pushing the Russian line back a little towards the north, but he anticipated that the real difficulty would be the fact that the capital would lie in the Russian zone, and that His Majesty’s Government would consider that this would give Russia an unfair advantage. # . I replied that I believed Count Benckendorff to be right in his belief that His Majesty’s Government have no wish to see the agreement of 1907 revised, but I added, speaking for myself personally, it appeared to me that such a scheme as he seemed to favour would lead to the early partition of Persia. We must not forget that what bad been openly represented as a commercial arrangement in 190/ had become, as was inevitable, a purely political one in 1914. I could, I said, see only one way by which, whether the status quo is maintained or not, the partition of Persia can be avoided, and that was by the establishment of a military force the gendarmerie, in other words—which should be allowed to act freely as a Persian force under foreign officers without any political bias in all parts of Persia. Would the Russian Govern ment allow such a force to act in the northern zone, given, of course, that they would not operate in those parts of the country where there are Russian troops ? I expressed my firm personal conviction that Persia could only be restored to her former state of independence and recover her position in the world as a kingdom free from the bonds of tutelage if the two Governments genuinely and cordially supported her in the development of the two essential institutions—the gendarmerie, which should take the place of an army, and the financial administration. M. Korostovetz smiled, and said that he did not think that his Government would look favourably upon the employment of the gendarmerie in the Russian sphere. St. Petersburgh had only just begun to realise what the gendarmerie is becoming, and he had been distinctly told that he must give the Persian Government to understand quite clearly that any reduction of Russian troops must be followed by anincrease of the Cossack brigade. Russia, he said, must have a force under her own officers on her immediate frontier; she would always he afraid lest the Swedes should come under the influence of some Power hostile to her interests. He intended to praise the question at once because he feared that if he did not do so he would one day find himself put an awkward query by his Government about the scope of the gendarmerie. To explain his meaning, he told me that he had been somewhat surprised when at Resht to receive the visit of two very pleasant Swedish officers who told him that they were preparing to put gendarmerie posts on the road between Resht and Enzeli. He had asked M. Sabline if he had been advised of this intention, and he had replied in the negative. Under such circumstances, he feared the possibility of one day hearing from the Russian consul-general at Tabriz of the arrival of Swedish gendarmerie officers for the purpose of establishing posts between the capital of Azerbaijan and, say, Ardebil, which would be followed by a rebuke from St. Peters burgh that he had not kept his Government properly informed. I said that a decision on the part of Russia to exclude the gendarmerie from the Russian zone appeared to me destined to lead to the partition of Persia because T personally considered that our position in Persia would not be equal to that of Russia if the entire northern half of the country were given up to troops under Russian officers, whilst our interests in the southern half were safeguarded by troops under Swedish officers only. We should be forced to bring in British officers, and the “ Schah de Perse ” would become indeed a“Schah de Paille.” Moreover, I said, I had reason to know that the Persians themselves would much prefer Russian troops to Persian Cossacks, because the former must one day evacuate the country or take it, with all that that would mean, whereas the latter could never be got rid of and would always remain to all intents and purposes a Russian force, paid by Persia, under Russian officers, equally paid by Persia, but under no contract to serve Persia, and acting solely under the orders of the Russian military authorities, Persia not even being consulted about their coming and going. Moreover, I asked, has the Cossack brigade during the thirty odd years that it has been in Persia ever done anything to show that it is capable of performing the duties that would be thrust upon it ? M. Korostovetz at once agreed, and said that it is just this fact that the Cossack brigade has never done a thing during the thirty-four years of its existence that has awakened a feeling of shame in Russia, that a force under Swedes has proved its worth after a bare two years’ trial, and has shown that Persians can be made into soldiers. The whole system would have to be reorganised, and put upon a sound business and military basis. Upon my expressing my warm approval of this determination, M. Korostovetz appeared to think that I considered that, under such altered conditions, there would be no objection to the brigade being employed exclusively in the Russian zone. He endeavoured to get me to authorise him to report in this sense to St. Petersburgh. _ it I replied that I did not know the views of His Majesty’s Government, to whom I had already referred the question, as I had foreseen that it must become one of urgent actuality; but that my personal opinion was that such a step on the part of Russia must lead to a total reconstruction of the situation, and that I could not consider that such action would be consistent with a genuine desire to see Persia re-established as an independent kingdom. There might, I ventured to add, be less objection to seeing the Cossacks gradually take over, as an experiment, those districts actually occupied by Russian troops to-day, with the exception of Kazvm, but I felt sure that it would make a very bad impression and lead to partition, which, I believed, the Russian Government as sincerely wished to avoid as did His Majesty s Government, were the entire Russian zone to be entrusted to an increased brigade. i j t It was clearly understood that our exchange of views was merely personal, and tor that reason we were able to speak out frankly. I was favourably impressed by M. Korostovetz, with whom I found it possible to carry on a most friendly conversation upon ground that I have always hitherto found most dehcate_ We reserved the various questions connected with the Russian Bank, the Trans-Persian Railway, the sale of the Crown jewels, &amp;c., to later conversations. From our very pleasant talk to-day, I have every reason to hope that the excellent relations exis ing between the two legations will be more than maintained. I have, &amp;c.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 16.) (No. 30. A r ery Confidential.) Sir Tehran, February 5, 1914. ALLUSION has been made in my preceding despatch upon the situation at Burudjird to the rivalry that exists between the Cossack brigade and the gendarmerie under their Swedish instructors. The question is, unfortunately, a much more serious one than a mere matter of emulation between two rival corps under foreign officers m the service of Persia. There are strong indications that the Russian Government wish to see the Cossacks increased in such a manner that they will alone be used in the northern zone, whilst the services of the gendarmerie will be exclusively reserved for that part of the country lying south of the Russian zone. A chance word of the new Russian Minister when at Kazvin, on his way up to Tehran, has awakened much anxiety in the minds of the Persian Ministers, two of whom have since represented to me that the Government would be obliged to resist any such pretension to the utmost M. Korostovetz said, in conversation with the Governor of Kazvin, that the withdrawal of Russian troops from that place would necessitate the creation of a force capable ot maintaining order, and hinted that such a force would be best supplied by the establishment of a detachment of Persian Cossacks m the town. As a matter of fact, the gendarmes who police the road from Kazvin to Ramadan have a depot at the former place, and are quite prepared to increase the number of their men stationed at Kazvin so as to guarantee order in the town. . . „ „ . ^ , The above-mentioned Ministers, one of whom was Minister for Foreign Affairs and the other his brother, the Minister of Finance, said that, mtbeir troops are far preferable to an increase ol the Cossack brigade. In the former case, either they will evacuate the country some day or they will openly take possession of it witli all that such a step would mean, whereas in the latter case Peisia is sa e for ever with a force that is to all intents and purposes a foreign one for which, more- ever she ha, t 0 pay, whether she likes it or not. They pointed out that the Russian officers attachef to the Cossack brigade are in no sense servants of the Persian Government They have no contract, take orders from no Persian official, come anc go as it suits the military authorities at St. Petersburg!! to tell them, without any advice of chanees being made to the Government, present no accounts and only render the ^ i T j tVipm when it falls in with their ow'ii views to do so.

It would appear to me essential, under ^ such altered conditions, that British officers should take over the force that the Swedes, have created with so much success. I trust, Sir, that you will understand that I only put forward this view in the event of it being decided that Russia is justified in taking over the northern zone with Persian Cossacks, and that I am as fully persuaded as before that Persia’s future as an independent nation can alone be secured by the employment throughout the country of a truly Persian force under unbiased foreign instructors, such as the Swedes. That force should be increased, in my opinion, as far as Persia’s financial resources will allow. There should be a strong depot always maintained at Tehran ready for any eventualities, and all idea of a small army should be discouraged—at least, until such time as the financial condition of the country is a much more flourishing one. The gendarmes are all that is required for the present, and, if Russia wdll allow them to gradually take possession of all the roads, order will be re-established, and the tranquillity of the country will be assured in a manner which will permit the Russian troops to be withdrawn much more quickly than if they were to be replaced by such an unsatisfactory military unit as the brigade has proved itself hitherto. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.] [B] PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. [February 16.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [6895] No. 1. Sir W.

J and 10 of the 11th January dealt with the questions of continuing the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway survey under existing conditions and ol the preparations being made by the general commanding the gendarmerie for restoring order in the Burujird district. I contented myself in the above-quoted teiegrams with a somewhat full explanation of the situation, but for fear lest I might create a misunderstanding in the necessarily rather cramped space of a telegram I did not endeavour to enter into the more complicated political aspect of the questions, winch renders them, in my opinion, extremely serious in the possible bearing that they may have upon Anglo-Russian relations in Persia. It was clear, I think, from the first moment that the question of a British railway to Khoiemabad was laid before the Russian Government that the scheme was not agreeable to them, although the idea was somewhat reluctantly accepted. Negotiations foi the option for this railway and for the Russian Julfa—Tabriz line v T ere carried on simultaneously, but as soon as it v^as clear that the Russian concession would be granted the attention of His Majesty’s Government was called by the Russian Govern ment to the danger that the proposed British enterprise might entail excessive expenditure on the part of the Persian Government, or might necessitate the pledging of securities that would be required for the guaranteeing of the large loan then said to be in piospect. Under these circumstances it is unlikely that the Russian Government will be unduly distressed to learn that the survey operations have had to be suspended. I merely call your attention to these points, Sir, 'without in any way wishing to hint that the opposition that has been encountered in Luristan is in any sense attributable to Russian action. There exists no shadow of reason for supposing, as far as I am aware, that such is the case. But the situation may possibly become somewhat different as concerns the gendarmerie operations to be undertaken in the Burujird district, upon vdiich, in my opinion, the ultimate restoration of order in Luristan so much depends. This district is entirely within the Russian zone, and, although Russia has shared with Great Britain the expenses incurred upon the gendarmerie, there can be no doubt that she is jealous of their being used in the northern sphere. The Russian Government would much sooner that the services of the Cossack brigade should be requisitioned, although no longer ago than last autumn the general in command refused to send a force of 2u0 men to Burujird in order to allow the gendarmerie to carry out a more sweeping movement than w r as possible with the force at their disposal. Moreover, it is well known that the Cossacks are neither sufficiently numerous nor reliable enough as a military force to undertake the vwk which the Swedes have in view. Given that the gendarmes are allowed to carry out the punitive measures in the Burujird region which they are being insistently pressed by the Persian Government to undertake, will they be permitted to carry on the operations into the province of Kermanshah, where it is highly desirable, in the interest of British trade, that order should be re-established on the important trade route between Kermanshah and the Turco-Persian frontier ? The situation upon that road has been intolerable for some time past. Representations repeatedly made to the Persian Government upon the subject of the manner in which the Governor-General, Prince Farman Farma, not only makes small effort to keep order, but allows his own men to distinguish themselves among the worst of the pilferers, have had but little effect. It is commonly stated by those who are in a position to know the true facts of the case that the Prince could easily restore order were he minded to do so. Under such conditions one is constrained to seek some reason why Farman Farma remains unpunished, although he persistently refuses to obey the orders sent him. A [2044 q—3 J2 remark let drop by the Russian Charge d’Affaires to a would-be successor to the Governor-General, to the effect that the Russian Government will never consent to the recall of Farman Farma from Kermanshah, gives a clue to the cause of the boldness with which the Prince persistently refuses to obey his Government’s orders. Undent the circumstances one is, perhaps, justified in seeking to understand why the Russian Government supports an official whose only claim to their gratitude is that he maintains disorder instead of re-establishing order, when it is generally recognised that he could quite well do the latter if he chose, with the very considerable force that he has at his disposal, as a backing to the strong personal influence that he possesses in the district. One is reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the Russian Government does not desire to see order re-established, either because it is in the interest of Russian trade that a valuable road into Persia should be blocked for British commerce, or because, as has been suggested by Mr. Smart in recent despatches from Tabriz, Russia has some ulterior political object in wishing to see a state of anarchy maintained in a district into which she may wish to penetrate later on. Some colour is given to this sup position by the fact that Shuja-ed-Dowleh, the Russian puppet now acting as Governor-General of Azerbaijan, has recently suggested to the Persian Government that the province of Kurdistan should be included in his jurisdiction, thus opening a straight path for Russian penetration to Kermanshah. The eagerness displayed by the Regent and certain members of the Government to see a gendarmerie detachment established at Kermanshah shows that they would sleep more'happily if theysknew that a strong Persian force lay across the Russian path to the south, through a district that may at any moment lend itself to an excuse for foreign intervention on account of its disordered state, a state for which Russia may justifiably be held responsible so long as she persists in her support of the wilful fomentor of the disorders. Moreover, were a force of gendarmes to be established at Kermanshah there would be much less danger of Salar-ed-Dowleh carrying out his threat to return to Persia next spring than would be the case were the Prince to be only opposed by a Cossack force, whose fidelity is as much open to suspicion as is its capability of doing anything open to doubt. Although I have felt it my duty to lay the situation before you, Sir, as I see it, I would most respectfully venture to suggest that no good purpose would be served by making a communication to the Russian Government for the present, at all events. Either, as I sincerely hope, my suspicions will be proved unfounded, or, should the Russian Government really harbour such designs as have been attributed to it, a communication upon the subject would but serve to incite the responsible authorities to take still more active steps to forestall the proposed movement of the gendarmerie. It is clear from recent despatches received from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah that the Cossacks do not mean to be left in the lurch if they can help it. There are 120 men now at Hamadam, and about 100 more at Kermanshah with a Russian colonel in command. Farman Farma wishes to make use of these men on the Khanikin road, but they are not suited to such work, and are probably too few in numbers to perform it. Still, as long as they remain at Kermanshah it will be hard for the gendarmes to go there, unless it is clearly understood that the Cossacks will remain in the town and the gendarmes go on the road. I had commenced to write this despatch some days ago, but decided to postpone its completion until I had had some exchange of views with M. Korostovetz, the newly- arrived Russian Minister, upon the subject. I have not yet found an occasion for an exhaustive conversation with him, but in view of the receipt of the enclosed despatch from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Hamadam, showing the interest taken in the state of the Kermanshah-Khanikin road by British firms, and for other reasons which will appear, I have deemed it advisable to take advantage of an opportunity which offers to submit my observations to 3 mu, Sir. Mr. Cowan’s despatch speaks for itself, and requires no comment, whilst there appears no necessity to transmit the newspaper extracts it contains. The new developments of the situation arise from the fact that it is reported that Farman Farma has, under definite instructions from here, as stated in my telegram No. 32 of to-day’s date, decided to send an expedition to restore order on the road, and that Ain-ed-Dowleh has made up his mind that there is no use waiting any longer for Nizam-es-Sultaneh, whose present whereabouts are undiscoverable, and has appointed his own brother, Haji Saif-ed-Dowleh, Governor-General of Luristan, with Burujird and Arabistan. This has been done with the full approval of the Regent and after consulting me as to whether such an appointment was likely to meet with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. It will not have been forgotten that the3 Ain’s brother incurred our displeasure some years ago in connection with an incident at Kermanshah, but the relations between Ain-ed-Dowleh and this legation were very different at that time, and other circumstances have changed. For this reason, and because the Minister of the Interior has shown himself consistently well-disposed to us since he has been in office, it did not appear to me advisable to oppose the appoint ment in question. Moreover, there would seem to be reason to hope that Sa'if-ed- Dowleh may prove an efficient Governor with the support of his brother. He is well acquainted with the district, in which he enjoys considerable influence. Despite the fact that the proposed Governor-General has by no means a brilliant record, and does not enjoy a very good reputation, Ain-ed-Dowleh appears to be confident that he will be able to secure the free passage of the railway survey party from Dizful to Khoremabad in a very short time after he has taken up his duties. His Highness wishes him to start for his post at once, but says that there would be no use in his doing so unless he can be accompanied by 300 gendarmes. Should they not be available recourse will have to be had to Cossacks. This brings us to the serious side of the question. As you are aware, Sir, a large gendarmerie expedition is being prepared for despatch to Burujird, but the general commanding says that their instruction is not yet complete, and much deprecates their being sent in an imperfect state of preparation. If they are not sent the Ain, who is not very favourably disposed towards the Swedes, may see in the general’s refusal to meet his wishes an intention to slight him, and may not unlikely have recourse to the Cossacks, who would probably jump at the chance of getting first to Burujird. If they do so it will put an end to the proposed gendarmerie expedition, as, on account of the question of command, and in consequence of the rivalry which exists between the two corps, it would be almost impossible for the two to co-operate. I have seen General Hjalmarson, who promises to send the 300 men if possible, but, after a conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I propose to advise Ain-ed- Dowleh to await the arrival of Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who has already left Marseilles, or at least to wait a little longer before sending his brother, so that the gendarmes may have time to make all their preparations in comfort. There would not appear to me to be any immediate hurry, as it is unlikely that order can be re-established in time for the survey to proceed this spring. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh entirely concurs in this view. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Vice-Consul Cowan to Sir W. Townley. ^ ^ Hamadan, January 27, 1914. WITH reference to my despatch No. 4 of the 18th December, 1913, I have the honour to enclose herewith copies of an article and a leading article from the “Manchester Guardian ” of the 7th January dealing with the question of the Bagdad road. # Shortly after the receipt of the paper containing these articles I was paid a visit by Mr. Heskel Peress, a Bagdad merchant here who represents seven Manchester firms. He informed me that he had written about the state of the road to some of his principals, and I have reason to believe that his example has been followed by other Bagdad merchants here. It is, therefore, evident that the Manchester firms are now fully aware of the obstacles in the way of their trade, and are not disposed to acquiesce in them without a strong protest. Mr. Peress is reputed to be a keen business man, and I have had personal experience of his honesty and straight dealing, and consider that his statements are to be relied on. As regards the articles themselves I am, upon the whole, in entire agreement with them, except with the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should demand that Russia should cease encouraging lawlessness on the road. Such a demand is manifestly impossible, as there is no direct evidence that such encouragement has been given, although it would be hard to convince public opinion here that it has not been and is not still being given. But I am more strongly convinced than ever of the necessity of immediately extending the work of the gendarmerie along the Nermanshah— Kasr-i-Shirin section of the road. When I was in Kazvin recently I discussed this * Not printed.4 question with Majors Karlberg and Thorell, and found that the former especially was in agreement with me in principle. Both he and Major Thorell, however, were afraid that the gendarmerie would never be allowed to police the road from Kermanshah to^ the frontier owing to Russian opposition. This opposition would take the form of a^ Cossack brigade at Kermanshah. I have occasionally in my diaries mentioned the prevailing report that such a brigade was about to be formed. I have now the honour to enquire whether there is any foundation for it? In my opinion the formation of such a brigade in this district would be most deplorable, and would realise the worst fears of the two Swedish officers mentioned. Now that the pay of the Cossacks has been raised to the same standard as the pay of the gendarmerie, recruiting in the western province for a Cossack brigade would seriously prejudice recruiting for the gendarmerie, as the lax discipline of the Cossacks and the quasi-Russian protection which they enjoy would be more attractive to most Persians than the hard work and strict discipline of the gendarmerie. Nevertheless, the existence of such a force at Kermanshah would furnish the Russian Government with an excuse for objecting to the establishment of a force of gendarmerie in that neighbourhood, on the ground that the Cossacks could do all that is necessary to restore order, in spite of the fact that the existing Cossack brigades have hitherto consistently refused to do regular police work, and have never done anything to justify their existence as a military force. I have just received the information that, owing to- the measures taken by His Majesty’s Legation, Farman Farma has been at last compelled to act in the matter of extortions by the road guards, and that, in consequence, caravan charges between Kasr-i-Shirin and Kermanshah have fallen considerably. This is satisfactory if it continues, but in order to secure any permanence it is necessary that the road should be patrolled by the gendarmerie, and that the task of keeping order on it should be entrusted solely to them. I have, &amp;c. N. -PATRICK COWAN. o[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.] [2044 i—5] PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. I [February 9.] CONFIDENTIAL. I Section 5. [5875] No. 1. Sir TF. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 9.) (No. 23. Very Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, January 21, 1914. I HAVE the honour to state, with reference to recent telegraphic correspondence upon the subject of the state of Luristan, which has caused a delay in the survey of the proposed railway from Khoremabad to Mohammerah, that the general commanding the gendarmerie is preparing an expedition ol‘ about 1,200 men, under six Swedish officers, which it is intended shall reach Burujird about the 10th March next. This force will be equipped with machine guns and a mountain battery, and will certainly be the most thoroughly drilled and best furnished force that has ever been sent against the Lurs. The general is keeping the destination and date of departure of the force secret, even from his own officers, and it is not stated in the general orders under which the composition of the force is arranged where it is to operate. He has also not informed the Persian Government of his intentions, although he is pressed almost daily to send an expedition against the Lurs, because he is anxious to deal a sudden and effective blow at the robber tribe, and feels confident that, were he to confide his plans to any member of the Government, either by accident or design, the news of his intended movement would reach the enemy, who would then have time to escape to the mountains, thus rendering his task doubly hard. It is not proposed that the operations shall extend further south than Khoremabad, and it is impossible to foresee what the effect of the movement may be upon the country through which the railway survey will have to pass, as far as the immediate future is concerned. It may be that the blow which it is hoped to deal to the Lurs may so inspire them wdth a belief in the power of the Government that they will renounce their old evil ways and become amenable, or it is equally likely that, driven back into their own country without any booty, they may be so exasperated that they will seek to wreak their vengeance on whatever may come their way. It is perhaps unfortunate that these punitive operations should coincide with the date of the survey w'ork, but, as there would appear to be no other way of restoring order than by teaching the tribesmen a lesson by means of the gendarmerie, and as there are other important British interests to be helped in the district where the measures are to be taken, it would seem to me highly desirable that they should be carried out. If it is not done, we have no reason to suppose that there will be any real improvement in Luristan, or that the survey work can be carried out; whereas, if the operations are successfully completed, we should have good reason to hope that it will be possible to finish the work of the survey satisfactorily at an ulterior date. When he has done what has to be done in the Burujird district, it is General Hjalmarson’s present intention to leave a sufficiently large force at Burujird and Khoremabad to secure the maintenance of order, and to send a part of his men to Kermanshah to take over the road between that place and the Turco-Persian frontier, on which robberies and exactions are carried on at the present moment on a scale that quite puts the Bushire-Shiraz road into the shade even in its palmiest days. Here it is not unlikely that the gendarmes will come into collision with the Cossacks for the first time, since the Russian officers of the latter force, who are with every reason extremely jealous of the successes of the gendarmerie under their Swedish instructors, are straining every nerve to collect a force that will be capable of doing work that properly belongs to the gendarmerie, but which, for political reasons, the Russians do not wish to see fall into the hands of the Swedes, who are so much more truly than themselves a genuine Persian force with no sort of political axe to grind. The Persian Government are fully alive to the importance of the gendarmerie taking over this particular road in their name, and thus establishing a true Persian force right up to the frontier, which will not only serve to keep order, but will see that disorder will not be fomented by interested persons who might well foster an unsettled eondition of affairs in a district into which Russia might one day feel herself constrained to send troops in order to protect foreign trade interests. Unfortunately, the state of the road is sobad, thanks in no small measure to the wilful maladministration of Farman Farma, that it has been found impossible to turn a deaf ear to the demand of the Governor- General for Cossacks, if no gendarmes are available. Bad luck or a well-timed appeal on the part of Farman Farma will thus result in the Cossacks getting first on to a road which it is most essential should remain in genuine Persian hands. The Cossacks are by no means well suited to the work which will have to be^ performed, and their past record is not one that inspires much confidence that they will do it successfully, so that it is yet possible that the gendarmes may have to be called in to complete the task. It is to be hoped that such will prove the case, because, if the Cossacks are successful at Kermanshah, it will be hard for the Persian Government to refuse what is sure to follow, namely, a request for the permanent establishment of a Cossack post of some hundreds of men at Kermanshah, which is, it is true, in the Russian sphere, but on a road that is of great importance to British and Turkish trade, and which will become of even greater importance when the Ivhoremabad line is made. The Regent has on several occasions pointed out to me how undesirable it would be to see a semi-Russian military force established at Kermanshah, and has told me that he would resist such a proposal with all his might.

I n n vp WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul McDouall to Sir W. Toumley. (No. 5.) Sir, Kermanshah, January 9, 1914. I HAVE the honour to report, with reference to my despatch No. 2, dated the 6th current, that Farman Farma is making preparations for his expedition to the western districts, but up till now he has not received the necessary funds from the Finance Department. A post-cart has been robbed in the Zohab district lately, and those who know the Farman Farmas methods believe that he instigated this to put pressure on the Treasury to pay him what he demands. I would not say that this is the case, but it is said. The telegraph superintendent, Khabir-es-Sanaieh, who has just come from the districts, was made to pay 16 tomans by the road guards, and the kalkhani refused to allow posts to be erected in their district unless a sum of 5 krans per post was paid. Farman Farma says he requires money, Cossacks, and ammunition. Colonel Ouchakof, who leaves to-day, told me he was hurrying back to see what could be done to provide Cossacks, as those at Hamadan could not be spared from there. The Farman Farma himself says Cossacks are useless, but, failing gendarmes, are better than nothing. The Cossacks, owing to their conduct in Salar-ed-Dowleh’s rebellion, have a bad name—in fact, no prestige whatever—and are locally said to be cowards who will never fight. Their conduct in the rebellion was probably due more to sympathy with the rebels than to cowardice. I had a long conversation with my Russian colleague regarding this expedition. He said we ought to write supporting Farman Farina’s demands for the necessities for this expedition, which would show that we acted together. He pointed out that any Governor replacing Farman Farma would probably be worse ; therefore it was better to support him and get this expedition made so as to ensure the safety of the road both for British trade and Russian pilgrims. I said I would write to you on the subject. I fully agree that if Farman Farma were recalled there would in all probability be a time of disorder largely due to the Farman Farma’s own methods, unless a really capable man were on the spot with a small force. I know of no such man, unless Nizam-es-Sultaneh were available. The Farman Farma is a man who must be driven, and even then will only work in his own way. The tribes being obedient to, and in constant communication with, him, I believe that there is no danger of his force being attacked, and that his presence in the districts with a small force is all that is necessary to restore order if he wishes to do so. This he will not admit, and says that the days are gone when his name was sufficient to restore order,'as the tribes now2 have magazine rifles. With such a master of intrigue and lying it is difficult to get at the truth. If he is to remain as Governor, it appears to me that we can only get order restored by supporting him in obtaining what he states as necessary for his expedition, and then constantly press him to put the road in order and settle the claims there.

Sir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson. Sir, Foreign Office, August 29, 1907. I HAVE to-day authorized your Excellency by telegraph to sign a Convention with the Russian Government containing Arrangements on the subject of Persia, Afghanistan, and Thibet. The Arrangement respecting Persia is limited to the regions of that country touching the respective frontiers of Great Britain and Russia in Asia, and the Persian Gulf is not part of those regions, and is only partly in Persian territory. It has not therefore been considered appropriate to introduce into the Convention a positive declaration respecting special interests possessed by Great Britain in the Gulf, the result of British action in those waters for more than a hundred years. His Majesty’s Government have reason to believe that this question will not give rise to difficulties between the two Governments should developments arise which make further discussion affecting British interests in the Gulf necessary. For the Russian Government have in the course of the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of this Arrangement explicitly stated that they do not deny the special interests of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf—a statement of which His Majesty’s Government have formally taken note. In order to make it quite clear that the present Arrangement is not intended to affect the position in the Gulf, and does not imply any change of policy respecting it on the part of Great Britain, His Majesty’s Government think it desirable to draw attention to previous declarations of British policy, and to reaffirm generally previous statements as to British interests in the Persian Gulf and the importance of maintaining them. His Majesty’s Government will continue to direct all their efforts to the preserva tion of the status quo in the Gulf and the maintenance of British trade; in doing so, they have no desire to exclude the legitimate trade of any other Power.

The Governments of Great Britain and Russia having mutually engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and sincerely desiring the preservation of order throughout that country and its peaceful development, as well as the permanent establishment of equal advantages for the trade and industry of all other nations ; Considering that each of them has, for geographical and economic reasons, a special interest in the maintenance of peace and order in certain provinces of Persia adjoining, or in the neighbourhood of, the Russian frontier on the one hand, and the frontiers of Afghanistan and Baluchistan on the other hand ; and being desirous of avoiding all cause of conflict between their respective interests in the above-mentioned Provinces of Persia ; Have agreed on the following terms :— I. Great Britain engages not to seek for herself, and not to support in favour of British subjects, or in favour of the subjects of third Powers, any Concessions of a political or commercial nature—such as Concessions for railways, banks, telegraphs, roads, transport, insurance, &amp;c.—beyond a line starting from Kasr-i-Shirin, passing through Isfahan, Yezd, Kakhk, and ending at a point on the Persian frontier at the intersection of the Russian and Afghan frontiers, and not to oppose, directly oi indirectly, demands for similar Concessions in this region which are supported by the Russian Government. It is understood that the above-mentioned places are included in the region in which Great Britain engages not to seek the Concessions referred to. IL Russia, on her part, engages not to seek for herself, and not to support in favour of Russian subjects, or in favour of the subjects of third Powers, any Concessions of a political or commercial nature—such as Concessions for railways, banks, telegraphs, roads, transport, insurance, &amp;c.—beyond a line going Rom the Afghan frontier by way of Gazik, Birjand, Kerman, and ending at Bunder Abbas, and not to oppose, directly or indirectly, demands for similar Concessions in this region which are supported by the British Government. It is understood that the above-mentioned places are included in the region in which Russia engages not to seek the Concessions referred to. III. Russia, on her part, engages not to oppose, without previous arrangement with Great Britain, the grant of any Concessions whatever to British subjects in the regions of Persia situated between the lines mentioned in Articles I and II. Great Britain undertakes a similar engagement as regards the grant of Concessions to Russian subjects in the same regions of Persia. All Concessions existing at present in the regions indicated in Articles 1 and H are maintained. IV. It is understood that the revenues of all the Persian customs, with the exception of those of Farsistan and of the Persian Gulf, revenues guaranteeing the amortization and the interest of the loans concluded by the Government of the Shah with the “ Banque d’Escompte et des Prets de Perse” up to the date of the signature of the present Arrangement, shall be devoted to the same purpose as in the past. It is equally understood that the revenues of the Persian customs of Farsistan and of the Persian 'Gulf, as well as those of the fisheries on the Persian shore of theCaspian Sea and those of the Posts and Telegraphs, shall be devoted, as in the past, to the service of the loans concluded by the Government of the Shah with the Imperial Bank of Persia up to the date of the signature of the present Arrangement. V. In the event of irregularities occurring in the amortization or the payment of the interest of the Persian loans concluded with the “ Banque d’Escompte et des Prets de Perse ” and with the Imperial Bank of Persia up to the date of the signature of the present Arrangement, and in the event of the necessity arising for Russia to establish control over the sources of revenue guaranteeing the regular service of the loans concluded with the first-named bank, and situated in the region mentioned in Article II of the present Arrangement, or for Great Britain to establish control over the sources of revenue guaranteeing the regular service of the loans concluded with the second-named bank, and situated in the region mentioned in Article I of the present Arrangement, the British and Russian Governments undertake to enter before hand into a friendly exchange of ideas with a view to determine, in agreement with each other, the measures of control in question and to avoid all interference which would not be in conformity with the principles governing the present Arrangement. Convention concerning Afghanistan. The High Contracting Parties, in order to ensure perfect security on their respective frontiers in Central Asia and to maintain in these regions a solid and lasting peace, have concluded the following Convention :— ARTICLE I. His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they have no intention of changing the political status of Afghanistan. His Britannic Majesty’s Government further engage to exercise their influence in Afghanistan only in a pacific sense, and they will not themselves take, nor encourage Afghanistan to take, any measures threatening Russia. The Russian Government, on their part, declare that they recognize Afghanistan as outside the sphere of Russian influence, and they engage that all their political relations with Afghanistan shall be conducted through the intermediary of His Britannic Majesty’s Government ; they further engage not to send any Agents into Afghanistan. ARTICLE II. The Government of His Britannic Majesty having declared in the Treaty signed at Kabul on the 21st March, 1005, that they recognize the Agreement and the engage ments concluded with the late Ameer Abdur Rahman, and that they have no intention of interfering in the internal government of Afghan territory, Great Britain engages neither to annex nor to occupy in contravention of that Treaty any portion of Afghanistan or to interfere in the internal administration of the country, provided that the Ameer fulfils the engagements already contracted by him towards His Britannic Majesty’s Government under the above-mentioned Treaty. ARTICLE III. The Russian and Afghan authorities, specially designated for the purpose on the frontier or in the frontier provinces, may establish direct relations with each other for the settlement of local questions of a non-political character. ARTICLE IV. His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government afhrni their adherence to the principle of equality of commercial opportunity in Afghanistan, and9 they agree that any facilities which may have been, or shall be hereafter obtained for British and British-Indian trade and traders, shall be equally enjoyed by Russian trade and traders. Should the progress of trade establish the necessity for Com mercial Agents, the two Governments will agree as to what measures shall be taken, due regard, of course, being had to the Ameer’s sovereign rights. ARTICLE V. The present Arrangements will only come into force when His Britannic Majesty’s Government shall have notilied to the Russian Government the consent of the Ameer to the terms stipulated above. Arrangement concerning Thibet. The Governments of Great Britain and Russia recognizing the suzerain rights of China in Thibet, and considering the fact that Great Britain, by reason of her geographical position, has a special interest in the maintenance of the status quo in the external relations of Thibet, have made the following Arrangement:— ARTICLE L The two High Contracting Parties engage to respect the territorial integrity of Thibet and to abstain from all interference in its internal administration. ARTICLE H. In conformity with the admitted principle of the suzerainty of China over Thibet, Great Britain and Russia engage not to enter into negotiations with Thibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government. This engagement does not exclude the direct relations between British Commercial Agents and the Thibetan authorities provided for in Article V of the Convention between Great Britain and Thibet of the 7th September, 1904, and confirmed by the Convention between Great Britain and China of the 27th April, 1906 ; nor does it modify the engagements entered into by Great Britain and China in Article I of the said Convention of 1906. It is clearly understood that Buddhists, subjects of Great Britain or of Russia, may enter into direct relations on strictly religious matters with the Dalai Lama and the other representatives of Buddhism in Thibet; the Governments of Great Britain and Russia engage, as far as they are concerned, not to allow those relations to infringe the stipulations of the present Arrangement. ARTICLE III. The British and Russian Governments respectively engage not to send Representa tives to Lhassa. ARTICLE IV. The two High Contracting Parties engage neither to seek nor to obtain, whether for themselves or their subjects, any Concessions for railways, roads, telegraphs, and mines, or other rights in Thibet. ARTICLE V. The two Govermnents agree that no part of the revenues of Thibet, whether in kind or in cash, shall be pledged or assigned to Great Britain or Russia or to any of their subjects.
