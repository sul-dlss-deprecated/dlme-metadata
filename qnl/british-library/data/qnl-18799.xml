                           Aucklandat Bushire; it's purpose being to collect up to date intelligence from the Resident. It notes that he has therefore delayed the vessel's return to India pending the receipt of dispatches from HM Chargé d'affaires at the Court of Persia, and the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. In the meantime, it notes that the vessel is being used to convey packets, and treasure to Bussorah [Basra] for the latter.It further explains that the Resident's expectation that Persian policy would be guided by the operations of Turkish forces on the Danube and in Asia has been confirmed by efforts to complete the fortifications at Karrack [Khārk, Jazīreh-ye].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x000026#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
