Mesopotamian Antiquities. (Memorandum bi t Political Department, India Office.) 1. The position before the war was regulated by the Ottoman Law of Antiquities, under which antiquities were the property of the Imperial Government, and it rested with the authorities of the Imperial Museums to license excavators. It is understood that licences did not allow the export of original antiquities, but only of photographs and copies; but this rule does not appear to have been strictly enforced in practice. The information available in the India Office as to pre-war operations is scanty ; but it appears that British, trench, German and American excavators had worked on various sites. It was reported, however, that the French had done nothing since 1909, and that the American operations had been relatively unimportant. How recently British or Americans had been at work, before the war, does not appear. Ihe Germans were at work immediately before the war at Babylon and other places. 2. During the early part of the war, a good deal of work appears to have been done by the Germans. On the occupation of Samarra by the British, some 90 cases of early Moslem pottery, glass, and plaster work, collected locally by two German Professors, were found packed ready for despatch to Berlin. There were also found in and about a house occupied by German excavators at Babylon, a large quantity (17 cases) of small objects—pottery, bricks, terra cotta figures, &amp;c.—and some larger antiquities. 22 additional cases of German finds from uncertain sites were also reported. 3. Shortly after the occupation of Baghdad a Proclamation was issued by the General Officer Commanding (22nd May 1917) declaring all antiquities to be the property of the Administration, and prohibiting destruction, unauthorised dealings, &amp;c. The export of antiquities, except under licence, was also prohibited. Officers and men of the army were specially warned that antiquities must not be damaged or removed. 4. Two questions of policy were in the natural course soon raised, viz., (i) what should be done with the collections of antiquities already excavated ; and (ii) what line should be taken as regards further excavation. The former question was first brought into prominence by the capture of the Samarra collection. Alter some discuss’on, the Civil Commissioner was informed in December 1918 that His Majesty’s Government were unwilling to sanction the removal of these objects unless they were such that their custody in European museums would clearly be the most appropriate course. In the course of the correspondence, a Foreign Office letter (27th January 1919) to Sir F. Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, laid down general principles which have been reaffirmed subsequently but not up to the present applied in practice to any particular cases Lord Ourzon is in principle averse from the exportation of antiquities from the country of origin to Europe, save in the case of duplicates or antiquities such as cuneiform inscriptions, tablets, &amp;c., where the inscription and significance can be more readily elucidated in a western capital or where the antiquity is such as to have little or no connection with the surviving city.” Permission has not up to the present been given for the removal of the Samarra collection from Mesopotamia, and it remains stored at Basra. The other collections made by the Germans at Babylon and elsewhere also remain stored in Mesopotamia. 5. Meanwhile, in November 1917, the British Museum had represented to the War Office the desirability of attaching a competent archaeologist to the army in Mesopotamia, drawing attention to the fact that a former member of the staff of the Museum; Mr. Campbell Thompson, was already serving in Mesopotamia with the Intelligence Branch. Finally, Mr. Hall was nominated by the British Museum and left for Mesopotamia in November 1918.4 C. Fite question had also been raised of taking steps to safeguard important monuments such as the ruins of Ctesiphon. It was decided in the autumn of 1918 that official research and excavation could be postponed^ but that operations limited to preliminary measures for the preservation of certain specified sites should be put in hand forthwith. A certain amount of preservation work has since been done. 7. Subsequently it appeared that Mr. Campbell 'Thompson (in the spring of 1918) and Mr. Hall (in the winter of 1918-19) had been allowed by the local authorities to undertake excavation on behalf of the British Museum on several sites, and that, though orders were sent to the Civil Commissioner on the 23rd May 1919 that the resulting collections must not be removed from Mesopotamia unless and until His Majesty’s Government were satisfied as to the desirability of their removal. Mr. Hall had before that date been allowed to ship to England both his own collection and Mr. Campbell Thompson s. r lhe disposal of these collections has been the subject of correspondence with the British Museum. The collections are now in the Museum, which has been allowed to retain them for the present on condition that it is recognised that the objects are the property of the Mesopotamian Government and that they are described as being 'lent by that Government. 8. The developments referred to above brought to a head the question of the policy to be adopted in regard to further excavation, it was decided, and the British Museum and the Civil Commissioner were informed in February 1920, that His Majesty’s Government must take the view that further excavations in Mesopotamia should not be allowed until the local Government had an Inspector or Department of Archaeology qualified to permit and control such excavation, and to take immediate decisions as to the disposal or preservation of the objects discovered. In some later letters, the form of wording used was that no further excavations could be permitted in Mesopotamia at least until a law of antiquities for that country had been brought into operation. Replies in this sense have been sent to the British Museum, who applied in July last for permission to send Mr. Hall out for the present winter season to complete the excavations he had in hand; to the University of Philadelphia, who asked in June last for permission to send an expedition (they had sent several expeditions before the war, to excavate at Nippur under a concession obtained from the Turkish Government); and to Professor Langdon, of Oxford, who asked in November last that the University might be allowed to send a representative to Mesopotamia to lay claim to a site. It should perhaps be mentioned that Professor Breasted, of Chicago University, was on the other hand allowed (mainly because information was received at this Office so late that it Was difficult to take any other course) to take an “ archaeological expedition ” to Mesopotamia in February 1920. with the object of inspecting possible sites for excavation. He was warned that it would probably not be possible to allow excavation work in the near future, and that no more could be promised him than that any proposals he might make would receive full consideration when the time came. 9. No definite steps have yet been taken towards the creation of an Archaeological Department, or a museum, in Mesopotamia. The provision of funds will be a difficulty; and in this connection it may be noted that Professor A. T. Clay, of ^ ale, visited Mesopotamia at the beginning of 1920 to discuss the question of establishing a School for Archaeological Research at Baghdad. Dr. Ward, an American, bequeathed his Oriental library lor this purpose, and Professor Clay stated that the Archaeological Institute of America was ‘‘ ready to support in a modest way an effort to provide such facilities. Professor Clay discussed the whole subject with the Civil Commissioner. ^ It is not clear from our papers exactly how this proposal now stands. The draft mandates for Mesopotamia an 1 Palestine include a clause providing for the enactment of a law of antiquities, on the lines indicated in the Turkish Peace Treaty, in replacement of the former Ottoman Law of Antiquities. (It is laid down that this law is to ensure equality of treatment to the nationals of all States, members of the3 League of Nations.) A law has already been drafted for Palestine, and a copy of the draft has been sent to Baghdad. 10. It may be mentioned that a close interest in the whole question has been shown by the Archaeological doint Committee (an advisory Committee formed at the end of 1918 by the British. Academy, in conjunction with the leading archaeological societies, with Sir F. Kenyon as Chairman). Ihe Committee’s comments on the Palestine draft, and a draft suggested by the Committee themselves, have also been sent to Baghdad. 11. As remarked above, one question outstanding at present is that of the disposal of the Samarra and other German collections, at present stored in Mesopotamia. It has been proposed from time to time to send the Samarra collection to this country, but it has not been considered possible hitherto to sanction this. The question has also been raised (and is brought up again in papers now under submission) of obtaining the co-operation of the German excavators in the opening and cataloguing oi the Samarra and other German collections. But in this matter also no action has up to the present been thought possible. 12. It should be mentioned that another large collection of antiquities (4-18 cases), shipped by the Germans from Mesopotamia before the war, was intercepted by the Portuguese authorities at Lisbon, on the S.S. Cheruskia, ..and remains there at present. Tentative steps have been taken with a view to inducing the Portuguese Government to return this collection to Mesopotamia; but, according to present indications, the Portuguese appear - determined to keep it in Portugal.
