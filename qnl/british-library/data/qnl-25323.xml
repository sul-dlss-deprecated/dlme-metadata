L$»- Colonel Cox wrote me officially yesterday that Haji Hassan bin ^amaye had already approached him direct in the matter of the shipment of oxide mentioned in my despatch No.42 and that he had refused him permission; this for my personal in formation. He said that he was not empowered to accept my inter vention in the matter of a shipment undertaken by Hassan for his own account; that it on the occasion of the last shipment he had corresponded with the Imperial Vice-Consulate this was due to a misunderstanding, he having thought the shipment was for Wonkhaus and Co:. •&gt; On what Cox bases this latter assumption I cannot comprehend for all we asked after the initial hindrance of shipment was whether shipment would be allowed if it was on account of Messrs: Wonckhaus. For such a case also the Acting English Consul-General refused his consent or the ground that he had no instructions from his Government, and then when Cos on his return from leave spoke to Hassan at Lingeh he gave him the desired permission (so he ^rote to me) without wishing to raise the question of whose account the shipment was for. Of course I do not know whether Hassan when on the subject of the new shipment informed the Consul-General direct that it was for his own account. Messrs Wcrckhaus in their letter on the subject to me only say that 4f Hassan wished to cleanse, break up and convey the oxide gf the beach with a view to shipping it to India after completio^of the cleansing etc: operations, which would take a month or two. own Whether on nis/account ( or -mining Company’s) or whether on account of others is not stated. As Cox sent me his letter, as usual, a few hours after the fortnightly post to Lingeh had left. i can only obtain information on this point by next postrepresentation of his personal interests through the Imperial 7ice-Ponsula ls. But as regards oxide cargoes - when these are Mining Company, in which Messrs: Wonckhaus (apart from their this justifies the intent Pen of the Imperial Vice Consulate, although these two points, i.e. Hassan’s right to represent the latter, are disputed hy the English. To this may he added as more external considerations (1) that Hassan has given full powers and transferred the representation o 4 ' his interests in everything concerning the Abu Musa oxide affair to the German firm, (2) that hitherto all requests and correspondence have passed through this firm and the Vice Consulate; that Hassan should address a request to the English Consulate-General direct is an innovation which I only learped of fiE®® from Cox* letter. Lack of time as well as serious eye trouble (as already, re ported) interfering greatly with my capacity for work have not so far permitted me to study the question thoroughly in all its details. So far I can only judge it as above and will answer Cox in this sense. I will also by next post ask Messrs Wonckhaus for precise information on whose account the proposed shipment is to take place and also why Haji Hassan has this time, contrary to his former custom, addressed the English Consulate General direct. Under the circumstances the reply can not reach here under about three weeks i.e. about the same time as the arrival of this des patch in Berlin. 1 respectfully request Y.E. for telegraphic ins tructions whether, in case the shipment is proposed not for ac- I am to maintain the standpoint that Hassan is acting as Director and that accordingly - the maintenance of the first two points not on account of Wonckhaus and Co. - he acts as Director of the contracts to deliver) are interested as partners. In my opinion Mining Company, and the partnership of Messrs: Wonckhaus in the count of Wonckhaus and Co but o^ Hassan or the Mining Company, of Company, that Wonckhaus and Co are partners in the Company merit ioned8 mentioned should as a matter of fact follow from the contents of the last Memorandum handed to the British Government-*- Cox’s denial of the Imperial Vice Consulate’s right to intervene is to be refused acceptance.

C-46. § Reference despatch- 5 G— 44 dated. 19th MayH After Lt-Colonel Cox had refused to permit the shinijient of oxide on account of H.Hassan bin Samaye which was referred to in despatch ho. 44 dated 1.0th ultimo, Meggrs 'Vonchhaus, Lingah reported to me, before receiving my enquiry on whose account the shipment was to take place, that they wished to effect shipment on their own account. To my letter imforming him of this Cox replied yesterday that his instructions only empowered him to allow such shipments as were destined to put Messrs WoneVhaus in a position to fuxfii their contracts concluded before the can cellation of|the Mining concession; and that as these shipments had taken place two ^ears since and therefore the shipment now projected could not come within this category he regretted he 7/as unable to take any steps in the matter. The stand-point of the English Consul-General seems to me unjustifiable, the object Ms attitude can only be chicane. The Bote of the English Foreign Office dated 10th January 1908 which Your Excellency communicated to me in your No.4 dated 5th January 1908 III-B 65f/358'0 might be regarded as a basis for the standpoint of the British Government in this question: but in that Note there is not a word about Messrs Wonckhaus’ contracts, but onl;y that the English Government saw no objection to ■Yonch- haus’ 'removing from the Island the oxide already mined and i ready for shipment'. This is precisely the case now, it is a question of some 400 to 500 tons of oxide which has already been mined and now onxy requires to be broken up and conveyed to the shore. ( That IM breaking up and transport to shore do not er~ elude the 'readiness for shipment' 1 have already had the honour to explain in my despatch No.! 1 ? of the 95th March 1908, and the consent of the English Government tc the 3hip%&amp;®&amp; then or thecarpet shows that the latter bays recognised as just the stand- poir.it there taker up by me). The refusal of wonderful as he had the Consul-General seems to me all the more written me or the 11th April last in connect ±ur. with the shipment per S.S.'Naseri' or account of Hassan that he had told nassan ' que lorsque nous consent ions a 1 * enlevement c_ ^naigem^n^, il euait entendu que le chargement serait pour le compte de la maison WoncVhaus and Cc, afin de la'mettre a meme ^ I d * executer leurs contracts; il n’etait point entendu que ce fut pourle compte de Kassan. Nonobstant une fois notre accord donne je ne aoulus pas retirer parole (entant que la Residence etait 0 , 1 cftncerree)' . Alreadyremarked in m^ despatch No.44, all I ha^e asked was whether the shipment would be permitted in case it was for vA- account of Wonckhaus. In any case the sentence quoted from Cox 1 s letter shews that originally the permission to ship was granted the German firm in order that they might fulfil their contracts. Wherefore does Cox now refuse, not two months later, the permit to Wonckhaus on the pretext that the shipments necessary to com pletion of contracts were executed tv/o years ago? (quite apart from the fact that as remarked above - the original general consent of the British Government to oxi ie shipments does not contain this limitation to the quantity required for the ful filment of contracts). Messrs Wonckhaus inform me further that the English represen tative in Lingeh had told Hassan that shipment could not be per mitted him because the oxide in question 'belongs to Messrs Wcnckhaus”. 1 at once asked the firm to make sure of thQ exact wording of this communication (to Hassan); should it be shown that emphasis was really laid (in the communication) to Hassan on the fact of the oxide belonging to Wonckhaus, that would at least be significant of the way in which Cox proceeds I From all these facts I can on±y see in Cox’s refusal to re lease the oxide an endeavour to make difficulties, at least to delay shipment by means of a procrastinating correspondence with Berlin and London, and also to show his power over all the yajr'fexs Part iesparties interested. 1 ain also convinced, that he vrill act in the same way in case he receives from his Government instructions to release this shipment and should later a fresh shipment of oxide still remaining over be contemplated. As yet I do not know if and how much oxide may be on the Island ready mined in addition to these 400 to ‘iQC tons. 1 will not fail to make enquiries and let Your Excellency know as scon as possible. I shall make another attempt to induce Cox to release the oxide by referring him to the above cited sentence of his letter of the 11th April, tut I fear that he will find some pretext or another for getting round the logical sequence of the same. I venture therefore to ask Your Excellency to take the necessary steps nov; with the British Government so that Cox may be instruct ed to release both these 400 and 500 tons and any other mined oxide which may remain over after their shipment, and to take the necessary measures for the safeguarding of preliminary labour and shipment. As for my right to intervene with Ccx even in the case of a shipment which, is to take place on account of Hassan or the Mining Company I have merely informed the Consul-General briefly that I must maintain my right of intervention in such cases but consider it for the moment superfluous to go into the question, as the present shipment is for account of lYonckhaus and Co and therefore my status in the present case is beyond question. I have already had the honour in my despatch 44 to expose the reasons which in my opinion legitimise the interference of the Imperial Yice Consulate or the Imperial Government represent ed by here. Now after examining the circumstances afresh I cannot give up the standpoint adopted by me then. If the par tnership of Messrs Wonckhaus in the Mining Company and Hassan f s right to represent the latter an Director,‘which together form the basis for the German intervention, are disputed by the En glish, this does not in my opinion oppose the up-holding of the standpoint described. The waiving of Hassan’e right -to- repre sent also leads to the logical conclusion e.g. of declaring the forward contract made by him with .'/onekhaus not binding on the MiningMining Company, and yet the validity of the contract wan upheld by the Imperial Government and the shipments of oxide resting upon it were approved by the British Government, Lt-Oolonel Cox does not fail in a single note written on the Abia Musa affair, especially when it is a question of shipments and the lilte, to remark expressly that all this is ’’without prejudice to the final ruling and decision of the whole affair by our respective Go vernments”; under the same reserve also I suppose/ must he placed the right of the Imperial Government and of this Vice Consulate H to intervene in cases where Messrs Wonckhaus are not interested directly as shippers but only indirectly as partners in the in (Mining) Company, If/the final decision Hassan’s right to con duct the business and the German firm’s partnership are recog nised - and that is after all from the German point of view one of the principal aims of the negotiations - It would be most im portant from the point of view of German interests that the business and the working of Lhe Miring Company should be inter rupted as little as possible during the course of the said ne gotiations . The importance from the local point of view of establishirg the German right mo intervene gains considerable weight from the fact that Wonckhaus’s contract -to- deliver with Hassan runs out very shortly. It can hardly be doubted that the English -at least so far as Mr. Cox comes into question - will use this circums tance to refuse or make as difficult as possible any further German intervention by pointing to the termination of the said contract; let therefore the tight to discuss questions in which Wonckhaus and Co: are already interested in their capacity of partner in the Mining Company properly represented by Hassan be established from the very beginning. Regarding obtaining permission to ship, I beg to observe that I shall upx represent this./Your Excellency telegraphically so as to avoid needless waste of time. But 1 thought it best not to send my telegram until my despatch ITo.44 reached Berlin and gave Your Excexlency a picture of the position as it then stood which would render a more lengthy and costly description of the same13 by telegram unnecessary. This telegraphic report would mahe the telegraphic instructions requested by me on the subject of the intervention question superfluous as this question for the time being is not acute by reason of the taking, over of the shipment on account of the Uerman firm. On the 'Other hand I beg to request instructions by letter on the subject. Copy Tehran (Sd) Listemann.1 4 TRANSLATION No.0.47 Euehiro 11th June ' 1 .91 n P^om - Listemann, Bushire. To - Imperial Chancellor, Berlin In continuation5 $ of my No.46 dated(j 5th instant. 8 % On the occasion of a brief visit from Mr. ilosenfeld the former Manager of the Lingeh Branch of Messrs posed shipment of oxide and derived the impression from what he said that Lt-Colonel Cox and his representative in Lingeh are striving to draw Hassan bin Samaye over to their side. Mr.Cox’s attitude to me too seems to pursue this end inter alia ; by refusing my intervention regarding shipments for Hassan and by declining to permit shipments for ’Vonckhaus this Vice Con sulate is apparently to be scolded, the bond which link to gether the Vice Consulate (or Messrs Wonckhaus) and Hassan are to be loosened and the last named is to be exposed mors than aver to English influences. Should Cox carry his point he would probably use it in order to give Hassan to understand that he could neither count upon German help for himself nor even expect that the German firm would be allowed to ship oxide in the future; then that would perhaps be represented as a gradual withdrawal on the part the Imperial Government as and/a precursor o^ a speedy final decision of the whole Abu Musa affair in favour of the English and to Hassan the moral would be preached that he would do better by a speedy surrender to save what still could be saved. The return of the prodigal would perhaps be made easier for him by the assurance that the , past would be forgiven and forgotten, and the question of the mining, concession regulated on a purely English basis so that Hassan too would find his advantage therein. A condition pre vious would of course be that he should completely forswear his former gods and make the above settlement possible by taking back and recalling all his previous acti(15 That Cox has such plans in view apart ^rom other 'reasons for his actions I consider highly probable. He is undoubtedly endeavouring to colxect evidence to corabat the strong arguments proofs and/adduced in the last German Memorandumt- 'Which I conclude from various indications to be very distasteful to him; to up set the German case without the u^e of prejudiced means would certainly be rather difficult. it may however be regarded as beyond question that Cox is not ion scrupulous in obtaining and using material for proof and in choosing his means: Shaikh Salim’s letter to his nephew segger in which he declares he never thought of claiming the Island o^ iibu Musa as his property is undoubtedly not Shaikh Salim’s own work and contradicts absolutely his former attitude. Similar letters, withdrawal of former declarations, caixing in question the genuineness of letters and entries in books may perhaps be expected from Hassan also and might possibly, as many of his statements and documents are of the highest importance for the whole case, give quite a different turn to the decision of the case. But if Hassan declared he had faked (forged) certain letters or book entries it would be as difficult to convince him of the genuineness^ of the documents and the falsity of his later statement as it is to prove that the above mentioned isikx letter does not contain Shaikh Salim’s real opinion and .vas not written by him of his own free will and spontaneity! it is however very probable that, Hassan might succumb to attempts of this nature; the old man, who for so long has put all his capital and all his energy into the Abu Musa mines, has only one thought (and that id) to see one more success before he dies: once he hag been convinced that he can achieve i this success only in the way indicated then it is quite possibly he would succumb to this very temptation, for he has lost much of his pristine vigour and firmness through old age, ill success and disappointment (Olcouragement), and even the rest honourable *rab remains in the long run an Arab, and that is a man who doesn’t worry about an occasional untruth. It may well be that these fears will never be realised, but theythey are not groundless. Nothing is farther from ray thoughts than to use such fears and anxieties as a foundation for an i Half a word missin attitude devoid of legal basis. But I am of opinion, as I had the honour to explain in my two last reports, that the most important points about this question, namely the right of Messrs: Wonclrhaus -on the strength of the English Governments consent of January 190B to ship in the future oxide already prepared, and the right of the Imperial Government and this ■/ice Consulate to intervene in the case of shipments on account of Hassan or the Mining Coy:, that these two points are comple tely justified in law, correspond to the attitude hitherto taken up by the Imperial Government and follow logically from it. My statement of the above fears and anxieties pursues exclusively the object of drawing attention to the fact that p or us to hold on to the above mentioned two points is not only sound law but under certain circumstances might be of the utmost practical significance for the final settlement of the whole Abu Musa case. As Mr. Rosenfeld told me there was no particular haste for the projected shipment I have abstained from the telegraphic 5request (referred to) in my despatch Ho. ^6 for the obtaining of permission to ship or rather for the^ obtaining o? corres ponding instructions to Cox, which would have required a more lengthy statement of the case and have confined myself to stating the case by telegram only so far as the present super fluity of the telegraphic instructions regarding question of intervention asked for in despatch No.44 was clear therefrom, and I thought for the rest I might refer to my detailed des patch No. 46 sent off last week. (Translator’s note. I haven’t the foggiest notion Wbat he means' is but thi^ what he says.) Regarding acceptance of (the right to) ship I have written Cox a tain that i consider his point of view unjustified and would request him to submit the question to a further examina tion: answer still outstanding. I heard from Rosenfeld that there must be a not inconsi derable . I17 dorable quantity of ready mined oxide lying on the Island, but he was unable to gi'/e the number of tons- even approximately; I will therefore by next post ask Lingeh for information. He also told me that the English communication to Hassan mentioned in my despatch Ho. 46 forbiding him to ship oxide because it belonged to Messrs: Wonekhaus, was transmitted to him verbally by the former Consular Agent Agha Badr, who is often utilised still as ' confidential intermediary by the new flee Consul( who is not yet completely into his work) and who also receives orders from Cox himself direct. The sentence in question is therefore not to be used juridically; for Aghd' Badr would naturally dispute it and even if his statement were considered ss counterbalanced by Hassan f s Cox would disavow his Agent and repudiate responsibility: nevertheless the communica- tion was probably as stated and would any how he characteristic of the English attitude. Copy to Tehran.C-51. Bushir©, 2nd July 1910. From - Listemann, Bushi^©, To - H.S. the Imperial Chancellor Dr. Bethmann Hollw©^. in continuation of my doapatch No.C~47 of 11th ultimo, iipon my request that he would again examine th© question of the shipment of 400 tons of oxide to India, Lt-Colonel Cox has now at length replied (15 days after receipt of my communication) that he cannot alter hisjopinaon and permit shipment. He states that he approved of the previous shipment per S.S.'Haseri' because he was of the opinion chat it was meant for the com pletion of former contracts of Messrs Wonckhaus; when he heard the shipment was to be for the account of Haji Hassan he did not wish to withdraw the permission once given, although ac corded under a misunderstanding; only on his return to Bushire had he learnt moreover that according to Wassrauss Messrs: Wonckhaus contracts had already been completed by the 'Louise” shipment of 1908. Under these circumstances he could according Vo his instructions do nothing more, and must ask ms to take any further steps to obtain fresh instructions to himself through Tour iJSfltcellency. Mr. Cox therefore returns again and again to the improbable story of his 'misunderstanding” about which 1 shall have more k to say below. As for the completion of the tfonckhaus contracts by the 'Louise' shipment certainly this (passage) does occur in a letter to Major Trevor dated 1st March last but at the game time attention is drawn to the fact that Oox subsequently tc tils shipment ^i-.fcrmed me that hs had instructions to faci litate the shipment by Messrs ddnekhaug all oxide already mined (compare ry despatch o* 1 6th March last). I do not know on what nr. wassmuss bases his opinion that the contractual obligations of tbs Uerman firm were completed with the 'nouisie* i shipment; the hitherto Manager of donckbaus’ hingeh Branch,j L I,r ' * {0s9rr 3l d . told ms during his 7isit here at the beginning of Jure that he himself did not know whether and how far the farm had fulfilled their obligations, as the matter was dealt with in Hamburg without full information being supplied to the Branches irj the @ulf c However that may he, the f'act remains that the British Go vernment m its g cte of the 10th January 1908 in no way made its permission to ship the oxide already mined conditional upon the completion of existing contracts; a fact which the British Government, certainly now seems to wish to ignore, as appears from tht, noi,e to the imperial uharge d t A f, fairs in London dated 22nd May last. Bhe description in this note of the w inisunderstanding* so often dragged in by Cor is somewhat curious: by tbe simple clear statement of Wassmuss f letter of the 9th August 1909 ” c r est la cOmpagnie miniere de Haji Hassan bin Samaye &amp; Co qui ^ent sxpedier cee 400 tons d’cxyde' ... Cox wishes to ’’understand” that Mr. ,7assmuss merely wanted to emphasise his opinion that a Mining Company existed in which Wcrcbhaus and Coy'’ had an in terest’. I can hardly believe that Oox wishes to attribute to himself such lack of intelligence as seriously to maintain that he did not understand this plain sentence. It is easier to as- sum© that the English party thought itself entitled to treat the Imperial Vice Consulate as quite a 'quantite negligeahle and so to twist its official notes as to give them a meaning which dovetailed with British xxxs aims but was the very opposite of the plain meaning of the words used which are as a matter of fact unmistakeable. I cannot refrain therefore from agreeing with the view expressed by Mr.Wassmuss in his despatch No.C.21 viz: that the way in which the Imperial Vice Consulate is treat ed by British officials is unseemly. Moreover the way in which Cox now tries to put me off with a repletion of his eternal ’’misunderstanding” seems to me hardly vseemly. I venture a t -respec tCitil J.y to ask Your Excellency whether protestjjjj' could no&amp; bo entered against, this treatment of the German representative ti here and a rep^ion of the same prevented. If Cox once ‘ gets the20 the impression that he can with impunity treat interpret and. misunderstand official Notes in the abo^e fashion, any further rendered extraordinaryly difficult and correspndence with him will be/unfruitful * dith equal right he might later on declare - provided he saw advantage in it ~ that he understood my statement that the proposed shipment was to take place on account of Wonckhaus and Coy: to mean that I wish ed to emphasise the existence of the said firm and perhaps to draw attention to* the fact that the firm had a certain interest in the Abu uusa affair. In short, he could later declare with reference to every single official note that he understood the precise opposite of what it clearly and plainly meant. 1 venture also to repeat my request that it may be laid down that this Vice Consulate has the right of intervention in such cases where it is only a question of the German firms indirect interest in the affairs of the Mining Company managed by Hassan; i I beg to remark that the English intervene in cases where the interests of an English party are much more remote and dubious than in the present case: e.g. the date question of last summer. Not to lay down such a ruling would in addition to the above mentioned disadvantages also inevitably result in a considerable weakening of the position of the Imperial Vice Consulate vis-a- vis the British Consulate General and third parties, and the English. Consulate-General would than think it could permit it self things quite other than the above described method of treating German official notes 0 Finally I venture to request Your Excellency to move the Government of Great Britain to instruct Lt-Colonel Cox to fa- all cilitate shipment of the 400 tons of oxide si and also/out standing already mined oxide in accordance with the position Copy to Minister Tehran.From - German Embassy, London. do - Imperial Chancollor, Berlin.

' ij To my Kota to the British Government regarding Abu Musa in continuation of III a 8610 of the 92nd ultimo, the enclosed re ply has been received. In it the British Government endeavours to prove that the shipments of ore intended by Messrs Woncbhaus and Go: are no longer designed to make it possible for the firm to complete the contracts for delivery entered into before the legal question, was raised, which was the condition under which the British Government had permitted shipment. Cherefore the demand of the firm (they say) is a clear violation of the agree ment between the English and German Governments; the British Consul-General Bushire in forbidding shipment has merely carried out the intentions of the British Government as expressed in the i^emo: of 10th July 1908; the British Government might claim to have the right to adhere to that^emo.; as meanwhile the wording of other Botes might be interpreted to mean that the shipment of all oxide already mined was permitted uncondi tionally they will agree to the desired shipment and instruct Lt-Colonel Cox accordingly. Meanwhile they hope the Imperial Government will not support other requests of this nature which ^essrs Wonckhaus and Go may make. In conclusion they declare that in the former case mention ed in my Bote the English representative acted correctly. Regarding the first part of this reply Note ( of the British Government) I have the honour to remark that their observations do not constitute an answer to the corresponding points made in the marginally noted (i.e. the German communica tion^. In view of the clear wording of the English Notes of the 4th and 23rd July 1908 which indeed have induced the Govern ment here to agree to our request, I had based myself in pre vious negotiations solely on these unconditional declarations of the English Government and have not gone into tbe pretexts9?

As however they do not wish to continue any longer the dispute, which has already xasted nearly 4 years, or to cause the commercial house interested any further loss, and as they moreover have endeavoured from the beginning and still are endeavouring to treat the whole question in dis pute in the friendxiest spirit possible, the British Govern ment propose^ settlement of the dispute on the lines of the following compromise:- 1. ihe English Government recognise the desire of Messrs vVonckhaus and Co. for compensation for the interruption of their work - an interruption which is to be attributed to the fact that Hassan Samaih was not in a position to carry cut his contract with the firm - and are ready to facilitate the fulfilment of this wish. The English Government propose that the firm should submit to them, through the German Go vernment an exact account of their claims for compensation under this heading, as they (British Government) have hithertohitherto received no precise information regarding the ex tent of losses incurred, although some light was thrown on the subject in paragraph 5 of their Kote of the 22nd August 1910 received 23rd august. 2. ihe English Government also recognise the desire of uessrs Wonckhaus and Go, to be placed again as far as possible in the position they were in commercially at the moment of the interruption of their (mining operations) and will to this end use their influence with the Shaikh o^ Shargah vm to get him to approve of a fre^sh concession to selected in dividuals for the continuance of said mining operations. The English Government will also endeavour to bring about a uni fication of the contents (?) so that the contract dated 1st July 1906 can be extended for a period equivalent to the du ration of the interruption of operations i.e. from 10th October 1907 to 1st June 1910. So that the contract could e.g. run from 1st May 1912 to 31st Jecember 1914. Should ^essrs: Jonckhaus in accordance with this proposal be restored to their old contract, their losses as treated under To. 1 would obviously be confined to the delay in re ceiving their commercial pr&amp;fits on account c f ‘ the interrupt ion of work. Also it may be noticed that notwithstanding any recipro cally - accepted clauses in the present contract the parties n are not bound to enter into a fresh agreement after termiratic of the (said) contract. 3. The English Government maintain in its entirety their y~ for magi position, that the Ghaikh of Sha^gah was acting within his rights as an absolute Sovereign when he recalled the con- j cession, and they (the Government) expressly lay down that neither they themselves nor the Shaikh of Shargah can be held in any way responsible for xosses incurred by Messrs Wonckhaus and Go.but rather the firm’s claim for compensation lies ex- clusively against Hassan Samaih. Meanwhile the English Go- vernment undertake to do their best to arrange that the firm shall25 shall r8G0i'78 coriipensation as eventually assessed. In oonclu^sion the Note expresses the hope that the Imperial Government, having regard to the good intentions which have influenced the English Government In proposing this compromise, will show itself ready to co-operate in the settlement of this long drawn out dispute by recommend ing Messrs -Vonckhaus to accept the compromise. I have not yet received any reply to my Note of the 6th November 1911 addressed to the Government here in compliance with the marginally noted instructions regarding shipment of oxide from Abu Musa.

Bated - 21st March 1912, We thank the Foreign Office for thedrcommunications to us which show the i«3llnat Igm. of the English Government in principle to come to a good understanding with us over the Abu Musa dispute. Certainly the communication of the English Government con tains fan expression of) the wish for a good understanding: but the way broadly sketched therein is quite impossible as it lies Government in the power neither of the English /nor of any other factor to restore the status quo ante* d Nevertheless we are favourably impressed by the communication of the English Government and hereby declare ourselves inclined in principle towards a good understanding between ourselves and the ether party to the question. We do so especially from a desire that the English Government also may recognise our good-will and that this fact may result in as good relations as possible with the English Authorities and officials there for our establishments in the Persian Gulf. We honestly and urgently desire to stand always on good terms with the English organs in the Persian Gulf and wish un pleasant incidents and the like to be excluded for the future. Immediately upon receipt of the communications we addressed Mr.Brown, who has gone through and worked through the whole matter, with the request he would as soon as possible make pro posals on the basis of which a good understanding might be arranged. We would also remark that ir our letter to Mr.Brown we laid stress upon bringing i.hto Play the greatest possible moderation in claims for compensation in order, so far as lies in our power to make the settlement of this ancient matter as easy as possibL for the Foreign Office and the English Government, UponUpon receipt of Proposals from that side we ourselves to present our claims for compensation Office and we hops this will he the case in four will permit to the Foreign to six weeks. Your obedient' 1 ( , (Sd) Robert Wonckhaus Go28 $ FRAGMENT of an undated and vary lengthy letter from Listemann to v. (The remainder is partly missing and partly undecypherable). &lt;$ Some time in 1913 apparently. x x xx obviously this is the only reason for such expressions sm the English Note as 'H.M.G. will endeavour” - 'will do their beat' - etc. That in fact the English Government will decide the question alone and without questioning Shaikh Segger is as evident as that the Shaikh would never be in a position to pay the amount of compensation but the British Government would bear the burden if it came to paying! (Sir Percy Cox’s letter which forms my enclosure No.2 shows sufficiently what is the English view of Shaikh Segger’s 'independence' and his 'sovereign right of jurisdiction' !) Perhaps it would be worth considering whether the 'binding obligation' of the English Government (would run to) payment in the shape of a guarantee? Should the English make difficulties over a moderate pay- of ment a further pursuit an the case appears distinctly xkb rich in expectation. The English Memo: of 6th December 1912 in ' Cs spite of the iaKgfc&amp;y haughty language in which it couched /v 'lit. proud note which it strikes) contains very numerous weak and very debateable points which it would not be hard to refute. aJr cVn-'O Real conyincing of the German Memorandum are scarcely to be found in it. As in the first English Memorandum this one often puts statements in the place of oroofs; what the German Memo: states is of course incorrect, what the English says is right; that needs no proof. The witnesses adduced by the German document are of course quite unreliable, those on the English aide above suspicion. It is for example incompre hensible why the Persian, Shia’ merchants of Bushire who have no relations with the Arabian littoral, should have more accu rate information about conditions in those parts thait the Arab Sunni merchants of Basra; the little error made by these latter when they speak of Abu Musa 'in Persia' is anyhow all the more pardonable29 pardonable because as is well knovm the Persian Government fell into it themselves years ago! The remark that some of the witnesses cited on the German side are 'petty merchants' would suit quite as well or better a very large number of the English witnesses. If all pearl merchants who work with foreign capital (vide 15 below of the English Memorandum) are therefore unreliable, one must refuse to believe and trust the whole guiltA of native pearl merchants, for hardly one of them possesses the fairly large capital necessary for the pearl trade, nearly all of them work partly with foreign capital! In the same way there is hardly an Arab or Persian merchant who does not when occasion offers smuggle as much tobacco coffee arms etc as he can! If the testimony of Abdullah bin Hassan Gelladari is refused as biassed because he is the agent of Messrs Wbnckhaus it is noteworthy that he was once Agent for to the German firm for about 9 months, from the beginning/aS the end of 1912, i.e. about 2 years after he had given up his wit nessing! If Nejef (enclosure 57 of the English Memo) swears he never offered Mr, Brown his share in the mining concession for sale, Mr, Brown (as he stated at the time vide enclosure 33 German Memo: November 1909) is ready to take his oath to the contrary, and it is only a question of whether more trust is to be reposed in the oath of a European or a Persian; usually the English ha$ little doubt about this question. When Mr. Brown on the 22nd October 1907 sailed for Abu Musa, says the English Memo: at page o3, he took a German flag with him and wanted to hoist it over the accumulated oxide. Mr. Brown disputes vigorously ever having had such a mad idea; the boat he was using belonged to Messrs Wonckhaus and carried the German flag as it did on all other journeys and when in harbour . at Lingah, that is all. And so the Arabs on the island fired upon the German flag. The account given by the Arab eyewit nesses of the attack on the boat contradicts in important points, e.g. in the time stated, the written report drawn up by Mr. Brown immediately after his return to Lingah: whereas the Arabs only spoke out some four months later, when their recollection3 recollection could hardly be quite fresh* The first Arab eyewitness only saw 10 to 15 Arabs in all on the beach some of whom were standing by the accumulated oxide; the other sees 30 in the same place I The circurns tance distinctly reported by Mr. Brown that in the afternoon a boat manned by armed Arabs pushed off to attack his boat, is wanting (in the testimony of) the Arab eyewitnesses. I only wished at this stage to give this small selection of inaccuracies etc.: It seems to me not difficult to refute many other important points of the English Memorandum and I will at once begin collecting material for that purpose in case no settlement should be arrived at on the basis of Brown f r proposals. At this point I beg once more to draw attention to the fact that the Abu Musa affair has stirred up a lot of dust in the whole Gulf and that it would of necessity greatly shake the position of Messrs Wonckhaus and German trade generally if in this particular case after years of struggle the firm named were put off with a small sum by way of compensation. The English would make the widest possible use of this in order to make it clear to the natives that one word o* the British Resident sufficed to exclude the Germans from this or that business and that in spite of years of trouble on the part of the Germans nothing can be done against it. 1 smst also give expression to the conviction which I have had for a long time but especially since the second German Memorandum became known to the English authorities here,namely that the latter know the weakness of their position very well and therefore are trying to defer settlement of the case. The treatment of each request for another shipment of oxide and of many other questions offered splendid opportunities for this system of procrastination; it seems as though the Resident, furnished in most matters with such ample full powers, were unable to x take the slightest decision in the Abu Musa case without obtaining instructions from London round by Calcutta] I have not thought it necessary to report fully in evto (Y.E.) upon the numberless small difficulties which have been made* But I am entirely under the impression that all the^difficulties and the meticulously tt dilatory” treatment of the case had for their object to tire out persons interested on the German side of the case and to disgust them (if I may permit myself this drastic expression) with the whole Abu Musa business to such an extent that they would only long to bring a the case to an end in any way that gave an appeai^hce of com- pansation. I can honestly assure (Y.E.) on the strength of a 7 years’ experience here and 4^ years' acquaintance with the Abu Musa case that such a settlement would cause untold harm to German trade in the Gulf, which already has to contend against such great difficulties. Should therefore a really satisfactory and sufficient settlement not be obtainable from the English I have the honour to request (Y.E.) to proceed further with the matter and act against the second English Memo: which as already stated offers many a weak and assailable spot and hardly one really con clusive proof. A further shipment of oxide to India is expected shortly* L.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000d5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/319C</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000d5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/319C</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 4919/1912 Pt 2 'Abu Musa Oxide Concession: transmission of files of German Consulate at Bushire'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1916/1916</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-05-11T00:08:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (32 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged chronologically from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 32; these numbers are printed or written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file consists of English translations of six letters originally written by the German Consul, Bushire (Dr Franz Listermann) to the German Imperial Chancellor, Berlin (Dr Theobold von Bethmann-Hollweg) and also from the German Ambassador, London (Count Wolff Metternich).
