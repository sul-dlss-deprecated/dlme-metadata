Secret, No. 35. To Flis Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. Policy in regard to the Aden hinterland. &amp; My Loud, I have given careful consideration to Your Excellency’s Secret Despatch of 9th August, No. 119, as well as t &gt; the enclosures with which you favour me containing the correspondence with the G-overnment of Bombay and the Resident at Aden. I am obliged to Your Excellency for thus placing me in complete possession of the opinions held both at Simla and by the local authorities upon the points of detail involved in the policy laid down in my Despatch No. ’20 (Secret) of 4th May. 2. The discussion throws light upon the views that have influenced the course pursued since the delimitation of the external frontier of the Aden protectorate, and it marks the difference of opinion that exists as to the objects sought by the local authorities and His Majesty’s Government respec tively. The retention of a part of the Aden garrison at D’thala, and the permanent presence there of a British Agent, are advocated by the Government of Indians developing the policy of the delimitation by the extended establishment of British authority among the tribes on our side of the border. To accomplish this end, it appears to be considered necessary to overcome the reluctance of the tribes men to accept the suzerainty of the Amir of D’thala; to carry our influence into the territory of other tribes with whom we had practically no dealings till, during the delimitation, treaties were concluded with representatives of the Upper Yaffai, who are now discovered to be persons of no real authority ; to secure for the Chiefs of the protected tribes ready and friendly advice in the settlement of tribal disputes; to check the spread of the Pan- Islamic programme in Yemen; and io maintain our reputation with the Arabs. In the opinion of His Majesty's Government, on the other hand, British interests at Aden are mainly centred in the British territory and fortress at Aden, and the primary object of recent arrange ments with the Ottoman Porte was to reduce the risk of international complications by arriving at a definite understanding as to the outer boundary of S. 26. A 19lliis cardinal principle, then, we hold in common. The suggested applications of that principle, how ever, disclose a view of its practical meaning, which I am unable to share. For example, Your Excel lency discusses the use of a subsidy in enabling the Amir of D thaia to hold his own either against the tribes or the Turks ; and the point is emphasised that “ such success as has hitherto attended the “ policy of consolidating the waning authority of the Amir of E’thala, lias been mainly due to the “ moral and material support which is afforded to “ hi m by the presence of our political agent and “ the British force at that place.” Or, as the Aden Resident puts it, the moral support of our troops “ in time overcome the reluctance (of the tribesmen) to accept the Amir’s suzerainty.” Surely here is an unexpected version of the policy of non-interference with the domestic affairs of the tribes, and studious non-entangle ment in purely tribal affairs (paragraph 8). It seems to reduce cordial adhesion to the much, less hopeful level of pious opinion. This rather perplexing interpretation of the policy of non-interference and freedom from entangle ment undergoes in later paragraphs a still more formidable extension. “ If Turkish intrigue and “ Mahometan fanaticism are to be left uncontrolled “in that country [the Aden Hinterland] so the Government of India assure me—“ we fear “ that we shall before long be involved in opera- “ tions that might have been avoided by a firm “and consistent attitude towards the tribes” (paragraph 13). But what is this attitude to be ? Interference or non-interference ? We are to take in hand from Aden the control of Turkish intrigue and Mahometan fanaticism. “ It [our withdrawal],” says the Resident at Aden, “ would afford them “ [the Turks] unlimited opportunities for . . . “ the furtherance of the Pan-Islamic programme.” Can we hope to exercise this control over such subtle and pervasive forces as fanaticism and intrigue without meddling in any of the internal and domestic doings of the tribes ? We are urged to look even further than this. “ There is a real danger,” Your Excellency warns us, “ that, if we “ now withdraw, in a few years we may be “ confronted with an independent Arabia.” These apprehensions, if I understand them aright, point to an indefinite period of such observation and control as would either be meaningless and in effectual, or else would inevitably draw us into that active, perpetual, and costly interference, to the mischiefs of which we all with entire sincerity profess ourselves alive. 4. Here I find myself compelled to draw atten tion to the Indian aspect of this discussion—that being the only aspect with which the Government of India is immediately concerned. We are, it would seem, to extend the military and financial liabilities of India, not merely to help or defendthe fortress at Aden, but “ to stem a re igious tide in Yemen,” though, by the way the stemming of religious tides is a delicate operation, ami has neve hitherto been regarded as a desuab.e or even tolerable element in Indian policy, ^t, I would ask whether this is a case m which ye^iould be guided by precedents from the North-West a other frontiers of the Indian Empire. The Aden Hinterland is not a frontier province in any natmal sense. Aden is an outlying post admmistratively connected with Bombay, and wholly different in its character fromthe boundaries that have been reac le upon our vast border line to-c'ay after twenty years of conflict both in counsel and in arms. II position of Aden, in short, in the ordering ot Indian territories and policy is peculiar, and arguments overlooking this circumstance may easily tail nf nnv true mark of Indian statesmanship. 5. Whether the rise of an independent Arabia he a near or a remote contingency, there can at least h* no doubt that the advent of such a question upon the international horizon, whatever part a British Government might choose to take in respect of it, would assuredly be a subject ol Imperial policy, not to he decided by considerations of Indian interest alone or even primarily. Bora Salisbury, as Secretary of State for India, pointed out in the year 1874, the marked change that has’been effected in the military, political, and commercial value to Great Britain of our position at Aden, since it came into our possession as a decayed settlement of comparatively small impor tance nearly seventy years ago. The Suez Canal wholly transformed its place in any system ol Indian interests, making it the key to the great commercial highway to the East, used by great fleets of merchant ships of all the nations ot the world. We are thus involve:!, said Lord Salisbury, “ in diplomatic action in which India “ l ias no direct voice and over which she has no “ practical control.” The occupation of Aden, m short, derives its principal importance “ from its “ relation to the general foreign policy of the “ Empire, in which it holds a position analogous “ to that of Malta and Gibraltar.” This propo sition is beyond dispute. In view of it any enlargement of Indian obligations in regard to Aden is wholly unjustifiable, and all operations tending in any degree towards such an enlargement are to be sedulously and vigilantly avoided. 6 * * 6. Erom these larger considerations of general policy, I pass to what may be regarded ^ as the secondary arguments in your Excellency’s Des patch. It is stated that Aden is unhealthy, and that troops cannot l)e tiained at Aden. Neither the Aden Administration reports nor the Army Medical reports accessible to me tend to prove that the climate has become of late more injurious either to Native or European troops. Compared even with the returns for Poona, Aden seemsto be not particularly unhealtby. Indeed, it would appear that the Native troops have suffered more severely than before since they were required to serve in the inferior. As regards training 1 understand that the position is not affected by anything that^ has occurred of late, and so mng as our military and naval requirements demand the presence of a garrison on this distant portion of the Presidency of Bombay, the situation must be alleviated otherwise than by the main tenance of a sanitarium in the interior. If in the opinion of your Government any special measures are required at Aden itself for the comfort of the garrison or for their proper training, I shall be ready to consider them, but His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to withdraw the troops which are required for other purposes at Aden to D thala, which is nearly a hundred miles from the coast. I shall therefore be glad to learn when Your Excellency in Council lias withdrawn to Aden, or, if you think fit, to India, the detach ment now stationed at D’thala, which can be most conveniently effected in the course of the present relief season. 7. I may notice one other argument which is brought forward as a reason for remaining in the Amiri country—namely, the control of the arms traffic. So long as arms can be landed on the coast, no troops that we can employ in the interior ivill prevent the passage of arms, and I am unable to agree that the Europeans stationed at D’thala can be of any material service in stopping that traffic. 8. The question has also to be considered in its financial aspect. The latest Aden administration report received (for 1904-05) shows the expenditure under the heads respectively of “ Political,” “ Terri torial and Political Pensions,” and “ Military,” as Bs. 3,02,014, Us. 73,775, and Bs. 38,54,091. Doubtless this scale of expenditure has since been reduced in consequence of the termination of the delimitation proceedings, but the figures I have quoted are very greatly in excess of those for the year 1899-1900, when the cost under “ Political ” was Bs. d ,97,826, under “ Territorial and Political Pensions” Bs. 73,383, and under “Military” Bs. 17,62,816. 9 9. As regards the Political Officer at D’thala, it was recognised in my Despatch of 4th May that in existing circumstances his immediate withdrawal might be impracticable. This view is confirmed by the Despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople of the 7tli August last. But His Majesty’s Government continue of opinion that his retention should be strictly temporary ; and the Political Officer should conduct affairs on that understanding, so as to minimise the effect of his departure when it takes pilace. In the meantime there is no objection to his discussing, as suggested S. 20. B'by Si r Js 0’Conor, affairs of secondary importance With the local Turkish authorities when necessary. He should, however, be circumspect in dealing uit i complaints, and careful not to exaggerate such incidents as may occur. The need for caution is shown by the precipitancy ot the action taken on the occasion of the alleged violation ot Amiri territory reported in the correspondence termi nating Avith the Government ot India s Lettei ot o.m-n Deeember 1904, No. 253. 10 I must request that no sort of permission or encouragement he given to the extension of any line of railway into the British territory at Aden without my express sanction, and I should h ve to he informed what steps have been taken by th e Abdali Sultan towards giving any concession for railway enterprise in his own country. I notice that the commerce of Aden by iand has fallen off in recent years, and I should wish to know what estimates have been framed ot tiie cost of a railway in the Abdali territory and ot its nrobable profits. 11. Your Excellency revives the question of the detachment of Aden from the Presidency of Bombay. That question, last raised by the Governor-General in Council in 1903 in the Despatch 155 mentioned by Your Excellency, is of great importance, and deserves the full consiueia- tion that you may be disposed to give to it. It will, however, be more freely discussed when the administration of Aden has resumed its noimal lines. Meanwhile, if Your Excellency should approve of any suggestions made by the Government of Bombay for strengthening the administi ation of that portion of the Presidency of Bombay, I will give them my prompt attention. Since the Resident must be largely occupied in his military duties, I am disposed to believe that the appointment of a specially qualified First Assistant to co-operate in tribal and frontier affairs, would be altogether advantageous, and I should he glad if an arrangement with that object could be made without delay. t * No. 66 (Secret), dated 14th May 1903.

I am obliged to Your Excellency for thus placing me in complete possession of the opinions held both at Simla and by the local authorities upon the points of detail involved in the policy laid down in my Desputch^/of 4th May, 2.

The retention of a part of the Aden garrison at D’thala, and the permanent presence there of a British Agent, are advocated by the Government of India as developing the policy of the delimitation by the extended establishment of British authority among the tribes on our side of the border. To accomplish this end, it appears to be considered necessary to overcome the reluctance of the tribes men to accept the suzerainty of the Amir of D’thala; to carry our influence into the territory of other tribes with whom we had practically no dealings till, during the delimitation, treaties were concluded witli representatives of the Upper Yaffai, who are now discovered to be persons of no real authority ; to secure for the Chiefs of the protected tribes ready and friendly advice in the settlement of tribal disputes; to check the spread of the Pan- Islamic programme in Yemen; and to maintain our reputation with the Arabs. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, on the other hand, British interests at Aden are mainly centred in the British territory and fortress at Aden, and the primary object of recent arrange ments with the Ottoman Porte was to reduce the risk of international complications by arriving at a definite understanding as to the outer boundary of S. 26. BBHHHBSSPiMH the tribal country in political relations with the British settlement. Turkish infractions of a serious character since the notification made to the Pnrtp in 1873, have been mainly due to the want of a map recognised as correct by both the Turkish and the P British Governments. Within the pro tectorate of the nine cantons since the occupation ot Aden in 1839 there lias usually been some dogreii of . disturbance, and the precise authority ot ihe leading Chiefs has changed so much from time to time that our policy in direct negotiations with the tribesmen has necessarily followed the varying exigencies ot ?he dav For instance, the Subaihis were by the engagement of the 5th of May 1881, recognised as under the “ sovereign authority ot the Abdali Sultan, but after live years it became necessary to treat that arrangement as inoperative, and the Subaihis resumed their former indepen dent relations with the Aden Residency. The guiding fact is that during tne last halt century these inter-tribal disputes have, to a large extent, regulated themselves, and admitted of peaceful settlement by the Resident at, Aden, without the continual presence of either troops 01 Agents in the interior. In the opinion ot His Maiesty’s Government the recent treaties ot demarcation and protectorate ought to strengthen the hands of the Political authorities at Aden m resuming the long-standing policy of inactivity, and call for no departure from it. It may ho perfectly true that the Arabs expect British troops to remain in their country, and that some Chiefs and some sections of tribes might be glad ot their support. But His Majesty’s Government never authorised any action calculated to commit them to this extension of their responsibilities, involving, as it must, an augmentation of the Aden garrison, and an increase of expenditure. Ihe protection formally extended to the tribes is a protection against foreign aggression, and had particular reference to the proceedings of the Turkish Government, in respect of which the situation has been fundamentally altered by the settlement of the frontier agreed to by the Porte. The presence of a British garrison at D thala is only too likely to he regarded as inimical toTurkish ^f^ste and as indicatingjin intention to interfere, m o r e than tormerlv m matters of tribal ad mini s- tiation. It is inconsistent with a policy ol reliance on the effect of diplomatic representations at Con stantinople in the event of violations of the frontier or serious disputes, and for the reasons stated in paragraph 2 of my Despatch dated 4th of May ^ is onen to other serious objections. 3. With much satisfaction I observe that the general principle now decisively adopted by His Uln.iestv’ s Government commands the cheerful adnerence of Tour Excellency in Council. You inform me (paragraph 4) that you “ most cordially “ subscribe to the policy of non-interference with “ the internal and domestic policy of the tribes.”rhis cardinal principle, then, we hold in common. e suggested applications of that principle, how ever, disclose a view of its practical meaning, which I am unable to share. For example, Your Excel lency discusses the use of a subsidy in enabling the Amir of D thaia to hold his own either against the tribes or the Turks; and the point is emphaai^d that “such success as has hitherto attended the P olic y consolidating the waning authority of the Amir of D’thala, has been mainly due to the “ an d mwhUu&gt;l support which is afforded to “ him by the presence of our political agent and “ British force at that place.” Or, as the Aden Besident puts it, the moral support of our troops “ in time overcome the reluctance (of the tribesmen) to accept the Amir’s suzerainty.” Surely here is an unexpected version of the policy of non-interference with the domestic affairs of the tribes, and studious non-entangle ment in purely tribal affairs (paragraph 8). It seems to reduce cordial adhesion to the much less hopeful level of pious opinion. This rather perplexing interpretation of the policy of non-interference and freedom from entangle ment undergoes in later paragraphs a still more formidable extension. “If Turkish intrigue and “ Mahometan fanaticism are to be left uncontrolled “ in that country [the Aden Hinterland] ”—so the Government of India assure me—“ we fear “ that we shall before long be involved in opera- “ tions that might have been avoided by a firm “and consistent attilude towards the tribes” (paragraph 13). But what is this attitude to be ? Interference or non-interference ? We are to take in hand from Aden th e con trol of Turkish intrigue and Mahometanr^fttnaticism. ^Thc I'm 1 i hci'anoa. of the Parulslamic prpgj^brtrnfe^in Yemen,” says the Resident at -&gt; ^Ldtfirf'‘’ r would result from our with- an we hope to exercise this control over ( such subtle and pervasive forces as fanaticism and 1 intrigue without meddling in any of the internal / &lt; a t- ^ Vnd domestic doings of the tribes ?

But what is this attitude to be ? Interference or non-interference ? We are to take in band from Aden the control of Turkish intrigue and Mahometan fanaticism. “ The furtherance of the Pan-Islamic programme in Yemen,” says the Resident at Aden, “ would result from our with drawal.” Can we hope to exercise this control over such subtle and pervasive forces as fanaticism and intrigue without meddling in any of the internal and domestic doings of the tribes ? TVe are ur^ed to look even further than this. “ There is a real danger,” Your Excellency warns/Uwjl “ that, if we “ n o w withdraw, in a few years we may be “ confronted with an independent Arabia.” These apprehensions, if I understand them aright, point to an indefinite period of such observation and control as would either he meaningless and in effectual, or else would inevitably draw us into that active, perpetual, and costly interference, to the mischiefs of which we all with entire sincerity profess ourselves alive.

I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant,S. 26. Note by Sir Hugh Barnes. I do not at all share Sir TV. Lee-Warner’s apprehensions. I have had twenty years of tribal management on the Indian frontier, and I think the Government of India and the local authorities are right. I agree entirely with General de Brath’s excellent letter. I was not in London when the Despatch of 4th May was drafted, and I was absent from the discussion in Committee, which preceded its issue. TV hen I returned I contemplated writing a note for Mr. Morley explaining where I thought the Despatch went too far. But in the end I decided to wait till the Government of India’s reply was received. I am glad, therefore, to have this opportunity of stating my views. I take no exception to the general warning contained in the Despatch to he cautious, and to refrain from extending our responsibilities and from interfering with the domestic affairs of the tribes. Not that I think that the Government of India have ever had any desire to annex, or administer, or to interfere unnecessarily with the tribal government. But local officers are sometimes inexperienced and occasionally indiscreet, and even the Eoreign Department may sometimes be inclined to make too much of trifles. Such warnings, therefore, as the Despatch contains are always useful and tend to keep the supervision of the Government of India alert and vigilant. But the specific orders given in the Despatch seemed to mo to be too positive, and I think the apprehensions, on which they were based, have been exaggerated. In the first place the demarcation with Turkey of the boundary of our sphere of influence had no connection with any so-called forward policy. I was the Indian Foreign Secretary at the time, and I was not conscious of any desire on the part of the Government of India to extend our respon sibilities or to increase the measure of our interference. On the contrary it was hoped that the demarcation would reduce our responsibilities by freeing us from the anxiety and the risk of frequent disputes, and of possible conflict, with the Turks. In the circumstances of the time, the demarcation was a measure of simple necessity if we were to ictain any sphere of influence at all, and I regard its successful accomplishment as a very valuable political achievement. It is the latest application of a policy which the Government of India has successfully pursued on many points of the Indian frontier for the past 30 years, the policy, wherever practicable, of fixing a limit both to their own ambitions and to the encroachments of aggressive neighbours, by laying down treaty boundaries. Thus we fixed the boundary of Persia and Baluchistan in 1872, of Bussia and Afghanistan in 1885, of ourselves and Afghanistan in 1896, of Tibet in 1891, and of Burma and China by the Conventions of 1894 and 1897. At any rate, the Aden demarcation is now an accomplished fact. It is clear from their Despatch that the Government of India fully accept the view that ordinarily questions of trespass across it by the Turks should he settled by way of Constantinople. They also assert that they cordially subscribe to the view of Lord Lansdowne and of His Majesty’s present Government that there is to be no increase of interference with the internal and domestic affairs of the tribes. It seems to me, therefore, that the only question at issue is the2 best method of dealing with the Chiefs and the tribes, in order to carry out this policy with due regard to Treaty obligations, and with the least risk of disturbance. Now, short of annexation, or administration in some form without annexation, which no one desires, there are two methods of dealing with frontier tribes in a position similar to that of the Aden tribes. There is the policy of absolute or almost absolute non-interference. That is the policy which was pursued for nearly 60 years on the Punjab frontier, with the result, as once described by Lord Lytton in a famous Despatch, that we were forced into constant punitive expeditions, and that no British officer 8 life was safe a mile beyond our own frontier. The other is the policy of friendly intercourse and co-operation with the Chiefs and Headmen, of givingthem support by the grant of small subsidies, of interfering not at all in the internal management of the tribe, while endeavouring to prevent intertribal fighting by tendering cur good offices in the settlement of inter tribal quarrels. That is the policy which in Baluchistan, while preserving the autonomy of the tribes, has replaced chaos by peace, order, and prosperity. There has been a battle royal between these two policies on the Indian frontier for the past thirty years. The latter has won the day, and has been successfully applied on the northern frontier, in Hunza, Nagar, Dir. Swat, and Chitral, while it was the hope of its successful application, so far as possible, on the Punjab frontier, that led to the formation of the Punjab frontier Province. I speak with knowledge, for after fighting the battle of the policies on the frontier I was able to w r ateh its progress from the Foreign Department under three successive Viceroys. It is the latter policy which the Government of India are adopting in the Aden Hinterland. To my mind there is no question of its superiority to the other policy provided it is properly supervised. We have object lessons in the results of both all along the Indian frontier. Twenty years of the one means no progress, but rather retrogression, for meanwhile the tribes become better armed and more unruly. Twenty years of the other means the growth of a new and more settled generation disinclined to fight, and accustomed to peaceful pursuits. The Aden Hinterland is especially well suited for the application of the latter policy, for, as in Baluchistan, the people have an aristocratic form of government and obey their Chiefs. The area, too, of the country is small, while the population is sparse and very easily controlled. In fact, compared with the difficulties we have suc cessfully accomplished elsewhere, the problem at Aden seems to be a simple one. We have a fairly quiet people to deal with, and have Treaty relations with their Chiefs, who are in our pay. Our objects are to encourage good government, to keep open the trade routes, to discourage intertribal quarrels, to control the arms trade by pressure on the Chiefs, to prevent raids across the frontier, and to keep in friendly relations with the local Turkish officials across the border. For the rest, the tribes should be left to govern themselves. While, therefore, reiterating the importance of interfering as little as possible, I w r ould allow the Government of India to continue their present policy and, at any rate for the present, to keep their Political Officer and the troops at D’thala. Otherwise, as experience else where teaches us is probable, we may bring about the very position we desire to avoid, and be forced into punitive expeditions to put down tribal disorder. The expeditions no doubt would not be serious ones, for the Aden tribes are not formidable. There is no comparison between Afghanistanand D thala, and very little analogy, it seems to me, between Somaliland and the comparatively settled country round Aden. But expeditious are to be avoided, if possible, and I think we are far more likely to avoid them by HintTnd. 0Ur PreSent POli ° y than ^ Wifchdra ™g altogether from the As to the proposed railway to Nobat Dakin, I would treat the Abdali Sultan with perfect frankness. We don’t want the line; but if he wants it and is prepared to pay for it I would not throw obstacles in the way The Sultan probably knows little about the cost of constructing railways and of their upkeep. I would offer him the best advice we can give him. If our experts, after examination, consider it would not pay, we should place th e figures before the Sultan and strongly discourage its construction. He is likely readily to acquiesce if he is convinced he will loose hy it. If, on the other hand, it will pay, and the Sultan can find the money, I would let him make it, and allow it to run into Aden. This is a very hurried note, and I intended to rewrite and amplify it. But as I understand Mr. Morley wishes to see it at once I send it on as it is. Since it was written I have seen Sir W. Lee-Warner’s draft Despatch. I am afraid I cannot concur in it. I demur altogether to his view that affairs in the Aden Hinterland were quieter before the demarcation than they are now. It is only necessary to read the account of Aden in Aitchisons Treaties to see that in the past we have constantly interfered to settle tribal disputes, and often hy force. If the orders which it is now proposed to give were strictly carried out, the local authorities would never he able to interfere at all. But that is an attitude which, in practice, I believe it will be quite impossible to maintain. Constant exceptions will he forced upon us, and in the end the sum of our interferences will he at least as great under the new as under the existing system, while our relations with the tribes will be hostile instead of friendly. My main point is that we ought not to forbid, as I understand the Despatch of 4th May did forbid,® even the limited amount of interference and control which expe rience shows us we have usefully exercised in the past. If it is now clearly stated that this is not intended, much of my objection to the Despatch disappears. I have no wish to see a railway made to D thala. If Turkish intrigue, encroachment, or interference on our side of the border did not exist, or could otherwise be effectually prevented, I should not be sorry to see the Political Officer withdrawn from D thala. But in the interests of the trade of Aden, and the supplies of Aden, for our own good name and because of our Treaty obligations,there are, it seems to me, two things we cannot allow within our sphere* viz., anarchy, that is, serious intertribal disorder, and foreign interference. To prevent the first, some measure of interference—at least as much as we have exercised in the past is essential; to prevent the second, it looks as if for a time at any rate it was necessary to keep an officer at D’thala. If we judge by the past, the Turks are sure to intrigue if they can, and it seems to me that the irritation between us and the Turkish Government is likely to be much less if border matters are quietlv settled on the spot without reference to them than if with imperfect information we are constantly making ineffectual protests at Constantinople. Without therefore agreeing in all the arguments of the Government of India, some of which, such as their reference to a possibleindependent Arabia, and to the need for checkmg Pan-Islamrc propaganda, “pear to me to be far fetched and irrelevant, I am m favour o leaving the Pobtical Officer in D’thala for the present, and I do not like leaving him fhe c w thout troops. I would also make it clear that there is no intention of nrohibiting such limited interference as the Residents have successfully exercised in tie past to keep open the trade routes and adjust intertribal quarrels. jj Barnes. 5th September 1906.CONFIDENTIAL 1906. T/«s document'is the^roperty ofthe Secretary of State for India. Aden Policy, Note by Sir W. Lee-Warner on Government of India's Letter, No. 119, dated 9th August 1906 (Pol. No. 1455/06). 1. The predominant issues seem to be— 1st. Has the policy advocated by the Government of India and condemned by His Majesty’s Government led to an increase of troops at Aden ; and must it continue to require this ? 2nd. Has it, and roust it lead to increased and increasing inter ference in the Hinterland ? 3rd. Is the retention of a Hill Sanatorium essential for the health of the indispensable garrison of Aden ? 4th. Is the extension of railways politically or commercially desirable ? I. and II. may be considered together. 2. The Government of India show conclusively that their policy will require a larger garrison than Aden required during the last century. The demarcation “ led to the despatch of the remainder of the British battalion and an extra native infantry regiment to Aden ” paragraph 10. “ These troops owing to the troubles in the Yemen have been located at « D’thala.” The Government of India have never shown how those distant and chronic troubles made this location necessary, and the argument if admitted vrould lead to still further increases \ loi the leligious conflict there is permanent. There are other reasons assigned for their permanent retention there; our protectorate treaty is said to require their presence, since our vacation of D’thala would result in the Amir leaving the district ” and taking refuge in Aden “ as his position would become untenable.” Why untenable ? Not only because of the Turks, but as General De Brath writes paragraph 6. i., “ the moral support ” of our troops “ will in time overcome the reluctance (of the tribesmen) to accept the Amir’s suzerainty.” So, forgetful of Afghanistan, we are to employ British troops to coerce the Amir s SU Worse than this, there is a wider circle of responsibilities which the presence of our troops is creating now after 67 years of peaceful hold of Aden In the country of the Yafai, and the confederacy of Juban, Nawa, and Dabiani, “ Turkish ascendency would follow on Turkish intrigue ” if we withdraw. S. 26. AA in the furtherance of the Pan-Islamitic programme in Yemen,” says the Resident, would result. So we are to cheek that natural and continuous movement. And finally, nearer Aden, “ the Chiets constantly appeal to us for friendly advice in the settlement of tribal disputes.” The nearer we are to these Chiefs the more frequent will be their appeals to us. Ir short we are to embark on an entirely new policy outside the fortress of Aden which will require an Agent and more troops in order to maintain an unnopular Amir on his throne, to combat a Pan-Islamitic programme m Yemen, to settle tribal disputes, and maintain “ our reputation among the Arabs ’’ paragraph 12 of the Government of India’s letter. At a time when we have barely troops enough for the most essential purposes, is it wise to begin a new policy in South Arabia which will involve such large demands on our strength . , Then as regards the political interference, we must not overlook the contrast between Aden under a soldier who has never had any previous political experience, and the North-Western Frontier. On the NorthAt estern Frontier picked political officers are controlled and educated. At Aden very ■junior officers are under the control of the Brigadier, and there is no one to check the natural tendency of interfering. The reports just received show conclusively that the local officers and the Government of India contemp ate the need “‘to promptly repress at its start any movement which promises to he dangerous,” whereas our experienced officers on the North-Western Frontier have in the last few days allowed Badshah Khan, and his brother, and the Dir Khans to light and settle their own disputes. We have not the machinery at Aden for teaching our politicals when not to interfere, and 1 1 j i ^ ji 4-1-1 om nf. A flpn out; oi tu8 ^- 1-1 in way of interference. . . . , Finally, we must enquire wliat all this interference will mvo \e m e way of expense. In 1901-02 political agencies cost Rs. 111 1904-05 Rs. 302,014, while political pensions rose from Rs. 6l,00U o Rs 73,775. Military rose from Rs. 2,046,857 to Rs. 3,854,091. These figures are taken from the annual report and may he incorrect; hut they suggest enquiry. III. 3. The Government of India consider it an increase of strength to Aden to have a garrison at Dthala, 95 miles distant, because i. Aden is unhealthy. ii. Troops cannot he trained in Aden. iii. The concentration of naval forces in European waters might leave “ the command of the Arabian seas in foreign hands, and our communications with the Hinterland would be needed tor supplies. # . . , . iv. We can better control the arms trade by plunging into t le m e These arguments seem to me very inconclusive. As to the health of Aden the Government of India produce no figures, while e administration reports tell another tale. The Aden report for 1904-0says ‘Hhe general hea 1 ^ of the civil population at Tawahi and Maala is reported to have been good.” The European General Hospital’s Sure were for daily average attendance :— 1 o Sick.

Ct U XA.U.Ollj clllLl. Ill tv Europeans ratlier healthier at Aden last year than in previous years. Hie admissions of* natives into hospital considering the strength, 670 men, were the highest for years, while there were only 906 cases of Europeans admitted out ot a strength of 1,367. The European death-rate was higher but not so high as in 1898. These figures, however, require scrutiny, as some deaths may be due to active service; hut, after all, compared with the so-calleu healthy station of Poona, the death-rate at Aden calls for no special remark. W ith a reduction of the Aden garrison to its former strength an improvement should occur. ii. As regards the training of troops at Aden, no complaints used to be made, since the country between the rock and Sheikh Othman is perfectly flat. If the garrison were reduced to its former numbers, which were considered sufficient for the fortress, there should be no difficulty in training them. This however is a military question. iii. As regards the Naval policy of the Admiralty and the need for communication with the interior, the argument seems almost desperate. But at any rate if we were at peace with Turkey there would be no need for a garrison at D’thala, and if we were at war a thousand men there would not secure us the supplies needed. iv. As to the arms traffic, it is certain that a garrison at D’thala can have no manner of influence upon the trade considering the long line of frontier and the Turkish landing places at Sheikh Said and north of it. Experience has proved that we cannot check the arms traffic without an honest international agreement, and that we can secure neither in the Persian Gulf nor in the Bed Sea. IV. 4. There remains the question of the Sultan of Abdali’s railway. Onr hands have been somewhat forced in this. The Abdali Sultan is very poor, and could never have thought of a railway unless it had been suggested to him. It is, however, certain that unless we allow it to run to the port of Aden no one will dream of making it. We have nothing to gain and much to lose by giving such a permission. If ever we were obliged to defend Aden in a war in which Turkey was against us, the railway might possibly even help our enemies. The argument of trade is surely a weak one. The 5. 26, A 24 imports into Aden by land, and our exports from it by land, are shown Value in Rupees . 1 1904 - 05 . | 1903 - 04 . 1902 - 03 . I 1 1901 - 02 . 1900 - 01 .

This railway project was never even discussed when trade was thriving in the last century, and the fortress and settlement of Aden were the main care of the Eesident. It was pushed forward with feverish haste and without reference to the Secretary of State only when the redundant garrison was sent out to D’thala, and the means of getting the troops back quick y o their proper duties was therefore required. The Secretary of State has never sanctioned the extension of any Abdali line into the British territory at Aden, and without that sanction the project must die a natural death. We have therefore the remedy in our own hands. 5 The Government of India raise a number of other controversies which only confuse the main issue. That issue is whether the ascertainment of the exact boundary of our protectorate and the Turks’ agreement to it requires a departure from the sound policy previously pursued of leaving the tribes to choose their own rulers and settle their own affairs. It is said that we have given them protection. But obviously such protection means agams Turkish or foreign invasion, and nothing more. We can only aggrava e our difficulties by planting troops a hundred miles from the sea on t ic ui is frontier, seeming to menace the holy cities, and offering outages o pioneers ot the Islamitic movement. _ i 4 . i h Whether Aden should be governed from London, or as it used 0 oe y the Bombay Government by means of a Resident chosen by the Bom ay Government, is a separate question. By law Aden is part of the Bresic ency of Bombay, and as long as the Bombay Government selected i s own Eesident it kept the settlement in order. The change began w len ie Government of India selected the Eesident without arrangement with the Bombay Government. A reversion to the former system seems lug i y desirable Whether ive can possibly control the arms traffic when the whole coast of the Bed Sea is open to their importation ; or whether the protected tribes should be ruled by a Sovereign or a number of tribal Chiefs; these are o standing questions which have been discussed for 20 years. But they have nothing to do with the main immediate issue whether we should ad o our other burdens an Arabian question, and plant a garrison, not to defend Aden by sea, but to stem the tide of Islamism in Yemen. For such a policy we have, I think, neither troops nor money, and, if once the troops are wi i-JPolicy in hinterland. No. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, regard to the Aden I have considered Your Excellences Secret Despatch in the Foreign Department, No. 119, dated the 9th of August 190G, dealing with the decision of His Majesty’s Government, conveyed in my Secret Despatch No. 20, dated the 4th of May last, and with certain questions connected with it. 2. The discussion throws light upon the views which influenced the Government of Bombay and Your Excellency’s Government in the course which has been recently pursued since the external frontier of the Aden protectorate was (dearly defined, and it emphasises the difference of opinion which has arisen between the objects which the local authorities and His Majesty’s Government respectively seek to attain. The retention of a part of the Aden garrison at D’thala, and the permanent presence there of a British Agent, are advocated by the former as a means of overcoming the reluctance of the tribesmen to accept the suzerainty of the Amir of D’thala, as a check to the spread of the Pan-Islamitic programme in Yemen, as securing for the Chiefs of the protected tribes ready and friendly advice in the settlement of tribal disputes, and as maintaining our reputation with the Arabs. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, on the other hand, British interests at Aden are mainly centred in the British territory and fortress at .Aden, and the primary object of recent arrange ments with the Ottoman Porte was to reduce the risk of international complications by arriving at a definite understanding as to the outer boundary of the tribal country in political relations with the British settlement. Turkish aggressions of a serious character have been very few since Aden was occupied in 1839, and when they have arisen such delay as has occurred in their settlement has been due to the want of a map recognised as correct by both the Turkish and the British Governments. 'Within the protectorate of the nine cantons during the same period, there has always been some measure of disturbance, and the precise authority of the leading Chiefs has varied so much from time S. 26. I. . Bto time that our policy in direct negotiations with the tribesmen has had to follow the varying exi gencies of the time. For instance, the Suhiuhis were, by the engagement of the 5th of May IS M recognised as under the “ sovereign authority ol the Abdali Sultan, hut after five years it became necessarv to treat this arrangement as inoperative, and the Subaihis resumed their old position ol independent relations with the Aden Residency. But the important point to notice is that dining the last half century these inter-tribal disputes, as well as more serious differences with the Turks, have, to a large extent, regulated themselves, and admitted of peaceful settlement by the Resident at Aden, without the continual presence of troops or Political Agents in the interior. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the recent demarcation and protectorate treaties ought to strengthen the hands of the Political authorities at Aden m resuming the policy of inactivity formerly pursued, and do not call for any departure from it. It may be perfectly true that the Arabs expect the British troops to remain in their country, and that some Chiefs and some sections of trihes would he glad of their support. But His Majesty’s Government never authorised any action winch would commit them to such an extension of their responsibilities, involving, as it must do, an augmentation of the Aden garrison, and increased expenditure. I he protection which they have more formally extended to the tribes is a protection against foreign aggres sion, and had particular reference to the proceedings of the Turkish Government, on whose good faith to respect the boundary agreed upon reliance must be placed. The presence of a British garrison at D’thala, which is only too likely to be regarded as a sort of menace to the sacred cities, cannot but obscure a policy of trust in the diplomatic assu rances made by the Porte, and for the reasons stated in paragraph :2 of my Despatch dated 4th of May 1906, is open to other serious objections. 3. It is, however, stated in the correspondence now sent to me that Aden is unhealthy, and that troops cannot be trained at Aden. No statistics are furnished in support of the first statement, and neither the Aden Administration reports nor the Army Medical reports accessible to me tend to prove that the climate has become of late more injurious either to Native or European troops. Compared even with the returns for Poona, Aden seems to be not particularly unhealthy. Indeed, it would appear that the Native troops have suffered more severely than before since they were required to serve in the interior. Be that as it may, it seems but reasonable to expect that when the garrison is reduced to what is necessary for the maintenance of the fortress and the protection of British territory, the health of the troops will not be worse than it was. As regards the training of troops, I understand that the position is not affected by anything which has occurred of late,j ^ -CL L *t:* T T v '£^ -c- A *e^t^iu. *Lcc/ and so long as our military and navy requirements demand the presence of a garrison on this distant portion of the Presidency of Bombay, the situation must he faced and alleviated by other measures than those recently employed, if in the opinion ot your Government any special measures are required at Aden itself for the comfort of the jgamspn^ or for their proper training, I shall he fi»jMied\to consider them, but JBis Majesty’s Government are not prepared to withiraw to D’thala^ f ud(U\ &amp;+Le y ^ 6g ■ ■ be C-'f*- *- ^x^lc-cn 4. I may notice one other argument which is brought forward in the correspondence as a reason for remaining in the Amiri country—namely, the control of the arms traffic. So long as arms can he landed on the coast, no troops that we can employ in the interior will prevent the passage of arms, and I am unable to agree that the Europeans stationed at D’thala can he of any material service in^stoppingj&gt;tiat traffi^ 5. 1 must, therefore, request that your Govern ment, in concert with the military authorities, will determine at once what the strength of the Aden garrison should be, and withdraw the troops altogether from D’thala in the course of the next two months^ 6. With regard to the discussion that has taken place regarding a line of railway, I must request that no sort of permission or encouragement he given to the extension of any line into the British territory at Aden without my express sanction, and I desire, to be informed what steps have been taken by the Abdali Sultan towards giving any concession for railway enterprise in his own country. I notice that the commerce of Aden by land has fallen off in recent years, and I should wish to know what estimates have been framed of the cost of a railway in the Abdali territory and of its probable profits. 7. Your Excellency in Council raises the question of an alteration of the law and the detachment of Aden from the Presidency of Bombay. That question, if it is to be revived, can better be discussed when the administration of Aden has resumed its normal lines. The demarca tion proceedings have apparently been misunder- stood ; when their proper object is^rHa^otfntiosd, the troops withdrawn to Aden, and the Political ^ / Agent 4* restored to his duties in Aden with only 7 such occasional visits to the tribal country as may be needed, I trust that the affairs of the tribes will settle down to the condition of comparative quiet which they enjoyed in the past. Your Excellency, I am aware, looks beyond these unimportant controversies to an “ independent Arabia which will “ have lost faith in our ability or willingness to “ keep our promises to our friends,” but His S. 2(&gt;. * B 2 &amp; ct 4imammamMaamm Majesty’s Government have no wish in circumstances to look further than the settlement and fortress of Aden, desiring only to protect the defined Na interland of th e Nnm Cantons f rom Turkish aggression' and to avoid creating any impression of a desire to manage tribal affairs or to take a part in the politics of Arabia. S. In conclusion I recognise that the removal of a large portion of the Aden garrison to a cantonment in Foreign territory so far from the coast, and the discussions which have taken place, without reference to my predecessor or myself, regarding railway extension in Arabia, have created a spirit of unrest and consequent difficulties in the re-establishment of political relations with the Nine Cantons on the old footing. But I am confident that with tact and loyal adaptation to existing circumstances of the traditional policy of non-intervention, the country will settle down to the quiet condition in which it was before the frontier was traced. If, however, Your Excellency should approve of any suggestions made by the Government of Bombay for strengthening the administration of that portion of the Presidency of Bombay, I will give to them my full consideration. Since the Pcesident must he largely occupied in his military duties, it would seem that the appoint ment of an experienced First Assistant capable of conducting the administrative duties of Aden and of controlling any tendency to exaggerate incidents or to take part in tribal disputes is a matter of primary importance.

To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., Eis Majesty's Secretary of State for India, . Simla, the 9th August 1906. Sir, In your Secret despatch No. 20, dated the 4th May 1906, you acquaint ed us with the views of His Majesty’s Government on the main questions arising in connection with the tribes of the Aden Hinterland and you intimated to us the methods by which effect should be given to those views. In your telegram of the 19th June permission was given to us to express our opinion on points of detail involved in carrying out the policy so laid down and on any questions affecting the administration of Aden. Of this permission we now (1) Letter to the Government of Bombay, Poli- Venture to avail OUrselVCS J and at the June ? 9 o(h N °' 2413 E - B '’ dated the 12th same time we forward a copy of the ( 2 ) Letter from the Government of BomW, marginally noted correspondence with the Political Department, No. 4967, dated the i 3 th Government of Bombay and the Resident July 1906, and enclosure. at Aden On the Subject. 2. The^ propositions advanced in your despatch are that the demarcation of the frontier has pot affected our policy as regards the tribes in the Hinter land, and that there is no desire to interfere with the internal and domestic affairs of those tribes, though the interference of any other Power with them will not be tolerated. You add as a further explanation of the policy which should be pursued that, while the strength of Aden must always be a standing object in national policy, that strength will obviously be impaired by quarrels with the tribes, intervention in their disputes, multiplication of agreements with them, the location of troops far from the fortifications of Aden, or an excessive readiness to resort to expeditions out of proportion to any advantage to be gained by them. You conclude that trespasses across the Turkish frontier should not he exaggerated and should be dealt with, if necessary, at Constantinople; that, save in a small strip immediately adjoining British territory, internal disturbances should be disregarded and no step taken without your express sanction that might lead to military or political entanglements; neither a railway to D’thala no'r a cantonment or sanatorium there should be contemplated; the troops now at D’thala should retire, leaving only a small escort for the Political Agent, who2 h If |I[l|j !J| Hi i : &gt; ! i Ji j ! y should he withdrawn as soon as may he, and should thereafter only visit the place temporarily and for special purposes. The despatch of postal runners or agents of Government into the interior should he avoided. Any project for dTsarming the tribes should he dismissed from consideration. Punitive expedi tions for offences committed during the demarcation should not he undertaken. No demonstration along the frontier is needed, and no attempts should be made to conclude fresh treaties without previous reference to you. It is stated that any other policy might draw us into a repetition on another scene of the recent transactions in Somaliland. 3. We notice that these instructions have been formulated in connection with the appointment of a new Resident at Aden and on consideration of the correspondence forwarded to you by the Governor of Bombay on the 12th March 1906. The proposals put forward by Major-General Mason, the late Resident at Aden, and the opinions of the Bombay Government as expressed in those papers were receiving our anxious consideration, as in some respects they involved important departures in the direction of an extension of the existing tribal levy system, of a scheme for managing the tribes adjoining the Turkish frontier through subsidised superior Chiefs, and of more energetic measures for the suppression of the arms traffic, the importance of which has been so frequently impressed upon us by His Majesty , s Government. Simultaneously, we had under consideration the question of the railway proposed by the Sultan of Lahej through Lahej territory to Nobat Dakim, at the point of junction of the main trade routes to Aden, and of the admission of the line to Aden itself. On some of these matters we had almost arrived at a decision. T-hus we were prepared to support the proposal of the Bombay Government that Ras-ai-Arah, which is now one of the principal centres of the arms traffic, should he occupied by a small force, in order to enable us to maintain a closer watch over the conduct of the trade with the Hinterland and a more effective patrol of the coast line, while at the same time protecting ourselves against the possibility of a port not directly under our control springing up on this very important section of the coast. Recent reports show that the export of arms from Jibouti to the Hinterland is in active progress, and if it is to be checked, otherwise than by its effective prohibition at Jibouti itself, as suggested by us, we cannot devise any other remedy in our own territory than such an occupation and patrol. 4. At the same time we most cordially subscribe to the policy of non-inter ference with the internal and domestic policy of the tribes, while not tolerating the interposition of any Foreign Power, which was enunciated by Lord Lans- downe and in which His Majesty’s present Government in the fullest sense concur. Our whole administrative policy has been directed to prevent the necessity for such interference; and we shared the objections of the Bombay Government to the punitive expeditions proposed by the late Resident, even though these were designed on the smallest scale compatible with the object of securing redress for the murder of a British postal runner within British territory proper at Aden, and for the discontinuance of a deliberate violation by the Turks of the demarcated frontier at Ad J)oka which, if unchecked, might well become serious. These are objects which within the tenour of your present instructions would justify active interference; and we are addressing you in a separate communication on the subject of the continued infraction of the frontier by the levy of dues by the Turks at Ad Doka; while the question of securing redress for the outrage within British territory at Aden will be further considered in the light of the present situation. As to the Lahej Railway, it is hardly necessary for us to remind you that the scheme uas not in any way due to British suggestion in connection with the presence of troops at H’thala, or otherwise, but originated entirely with the Sultan himself, who granted a concession in 1904 to the firm of Cowasji Dinshaw. This con cession did not appear to be altogether suitable in the interests either of the Sultan or British territory, and since then we have been trying to make more satisfactory arrangements to enable the Sultan to give effect to his laud able desire to develope his territory, which we could hardly prohibit, while abstaining as far as possible from interference in his internal affairs. Iho3 matter will be reported to you in due course, and we need not do more here than remark that, if the Turks do take steps to carry out their proiect of constructing a railway from Hodeida or Mocha to Taiz with the assistance of iomgn engineers and capitalists, some improvements in communications with the Hinterland will probably be necessary, unless Aden is to lose the whole of the inland trade and to sacrifice her strategical security on the landward side. . 0n the subject of the general control of the tribes, the late Resident inclined to direct dealings with the smaller Sheikhs and a possible extension of the levy system to watch the demarcated frontier. The Bombay Govern ment on the other hand, as is shown in paragraph 9 of their letter of the 13th July, which forms an enclosure of this despatch, favour a system of granting subsidies to the important Chiefs. ^ On the merits of these alternative policies we had not yet arrived at a decision. The controversy has cropped up in various portions of the Indian land frontier: each case can only be decided on its merits: and the matter must now await the final settlement of the main question of policy. We would only indicate that, if the proposals of the Bombay Government are adopted and the Chiefs are able to hold their own, there may be a risk of serious collisions between the forces of the subsidised Chiefs and the Turkish troops, which it would be impossible to ignore, unless the Chief, as might easily happen at D’thala, came to terms with the Turks with the result that the objects of the demarcation of the frontier would be entirely frustrated. At the same time we venture to doubt if any reasonable subsidy would enable either of the Chiefs or at any rate the Amir of D’thala to hold his own either against the tribes or the Turks, for such success as has hitherto attended the policy of consolidating the waning authority of the Amir of D’thala has been mainly due to the moral and material support which is afforded to him by the presence of our Political Agent and the British force at that place. 6. His Majesty’s Government deprecate the despatch of postal runners or agents into the interior, and probably have in view the unfortunate case of the postal runner who was recently murdered as he was leaving Aden for the Hinterland. The maintenance of a political establishment, and a military force at D thala no doubt necessitates the up-keep of communications, and the frequent passage^ of posts and supplies. The recent outrage, however, occurred not in tribal territory, but within the limits of British administration; and, even if our post were withdrawn from D’thala at once, it would be impracticable to avoid the need for maintaining communications with the Sultan of Lahej, and other Chiefs of the Hinterland; if we did so, it would create the impression among our proteges that we had determined to abandon them to the aggression of the turbulent trans-frontier tribes under nominal Turkish rule. We desire to emphasise strongly the total loss of confidence in our will or capacity to protect them which must follow such a belief and the disastrous effect which this would necessarily have not only on our relations with the tribes themselves, but also on our dealings with the local Turkish officials. 7. We have noted the opinion that any protest against Turkish aggression should be by way of action at Constantinople, and recognise fully that in the ultimate resort this is the only means of bringing pressure to bear upon the Porte. At the same time we desire to draw attention to the fact that the relations of our Political Agent at D’thala with the local Turkish officials at Kataba have been most cordial and friendly. He has recently obtained the pay ment of the sum of £400 due to the Amir of D’thala for damages caused during the forcible occupation of his villages, and he has been able to secure a friendly settlement of frontier cases which might otherwise have led to serious trouble, besides taking direct action through the tribes, which promises to be successful* for the restoration of damaged and destroyed boundary pillars. But for his presence at D’thala and the influence that he there exerts, these objects could not have been attained without difficult negotiations at Constantinople, which, in view of the habitual procrastination of the Porte, might have involved serious measures. We would, therefore, deprecate the entire stoppage of such friendly relations with the local Turkish officials.4 8. Having thus explained that we have no desire to extend our rospon- gihilities and entangle ourselves in purely tribal affairs, we proceed to the examination of a question to which we attach vital importance and which it appears to us may have been prejudged, under ^ejdea that we are associated with a policy that we in no way desire to support. We refer to the decision that the troops and the Political Agent should be withdrawn from D thala. If His Majesty’s Government were led to that decision by a fear that our ageats at D* thala would use their position there as a vantage-ground for undue inter ference with the tribes, their views may be materially modihed by the strong opinion of the Bombay Government, which at first viewed the establishment of the Political Agency there with distrust, and by the assurances to the contrary which we have now given. And the facts that there is no accommodation for the D’thala troops at Aden, and that the arrangements necessary for their return to India or England must involve some delay, give us an opportunity of submitting the matter for reconsideration both on strategical and general grounds. 9. His Majesty’s Government hold that the strength of Aden as a fortress will obviously be impaired by the location of troops at a distance from its fortifications, and that, as the recent delimitation has fixed a line beyond which Turkish troops or agents cannot advance, the rfitcntion of British troops or the permanent maintenance of a Political Agent at D thala, is both unprofi table and a source of weakness. We desire respectfully to question these con clusions. Regarded from a purely strategic point of view, the situation of the post at D’thala only 96 miles from Aden is, in the opinion of our military advisers, such as to augment the strength of that fortress Eor dominating as D’thala does the principal points on the newly-demarcated frontier, and com manding the main trade routes which lead to Aden from the Hinterland, it enables us with a small body of troops, and at no great expense, owing to the comparatively small extent of country concerned (far smaller than that of Somaliland) to enforce our will at any time and promptly to repress at its start anv movement which promises to he dangerous. ^ If we were to withdraw from this advantageous position, we should leave the initiative to the tribes, who by choosing the time most inconvenient to us could give much trouble and lock up a considerable body of troops. It must be remembered, moreover, that D’thala occupies an important position on the line of communications between Aden and Yemen, and that there is a prospect that the tiedjaz Railway will at a near date be continued to the Yemen, or that an independent line linking up with the Hedjaz system will be constructed. It is in fact only a few months since the British Ambassadors at Constantinople and Baris informed Sir Edward Grey of schemes seriously put forward for a line from Hodeida through Sana to Taiz, in the direction of Aden, which would he linked up with the Hedjaz line. With a Turkish rail-head at Taiz close to our recently-delimitated border and linked up with Constantinople and no point occupied in the Hinterland from which British influence could be effectively exerted to retain the allegiance of the tribes, it would be possible seriously to threaten Aden from the land side, and the whole strategic position of that fortress would be changed. 10. The sanctioned garrison of the Aden Fortress consists of the following troops:— 3 Companies Royal Garrison Artillery; 600 British Infantry; 1 Company Sappers ; 1 Battalion Native Infantry ; The Aden Troop. Barrack accommodation does not exist for more than this strength and it is impossible to keep troops in camp at Aden. The former practice was o retain the remainder of the British Regiment in India, which was in every way undesirable. The necessity for producing visible arguments on the spot m the fshape of ships of war at Hodeida and a stronger military force at D’thala, in order to overcome the reluctance of the Turks to carry out their own proposals for demarcation, led to the despatch of the remainder of the British Battalion and of an extra ative Infantry Regiment to Aden; and these troops, owing to the troubles in the Yemen after the conclusion of the demarcation of the frontier, have been located at I) thala with the happiest results on our influence with the tribes. The present policy of concentrating our naval forces in European waters might easily leave the command of the Arabian Sea in the hands of a Eoieign Bower for a considerable time, in which case it would be most desirable to have our communications with the Hinterland and its supplies fully open. More than this, the sanctioned garrison of Aden is not sufficient to man the defences, even if the deteriorating effect of the climate can he over looked, and in the event of war with a Naval Power an immediate increase would he necessary and this it might not be possible then to send by sea. The climate of Aden is such as to tax severely the health of the troops stationed there. Owing to the nature of the country very little military training can be done, while no other occupation or amusements are available for the men. This combination of a most trying climate with enforced idleness has a disastrous effect on their health. On the other hand, the uplands of D’thala form an admirable training ground, while the climate admits of men working in the open air all day long. They thus retain excellent health, and their efficiency as soldiers is very different from that of men confined to the limits of the fortress of Aden. Even if the other weighty reasons adduced by the Resident and ^ the Bombay Government for retaining troops there can be ignored, we consider that, on the score of humanity, as well as of efficiency, the withdrawal of the troops from D’thala to Aden is to be deprecated. On military and strategical considerations, therefore, our Military advisers regard the withdrawal of the force at D’thala as open to serious objection, and we entirely concur in their view which will, we trust, receive full consideration. 11. Erom a political point of view, we are no less opposed to a withdrawal from D’thala. The mere delimitation of the frontier line seems to us to be little security against the advance, if not of Turkish troops, at least of Turkish agents, as the Ad Doka incident shows; and a Political Officer stationed at Aden and only occasionally visiting D’thala would have small opportunity of check ing or reporting the existence of Turkish intrigues in the protected territory. It must be remembered that, after such a withdrawal as is now contemplated* he could probably only pay such visits with a considerable escort, which might give rise to trouble and certainly would not conduce to the ready collection of secret information or the spread of friendly influence. The result of this ignorance and impotence might well he a spread of disaffection in the country behind Aden, which in the event of difficulties with Turkey or some other Power would greatly weaken the position of the fortress. It is, moreover,! undoubted that we are bound to check raids or encroachments from the BritisM side upon Turkish territory ; and this obligation has been repeatedly recognised' by His Majesty’s Government and enjoined upon us by them at the instance of the Turkish Government. Eor this purpose no instrument can be so effective and inexpensive as a small body of troops maintained in a central position at D’thala. 12. Another political consideration is the effect which our withdrawal would have upon our reputation among the Arabs, a matter of the first import ance, especially at present, when it is doubtful whether the Turks will be able to restore their rule in Yemen, or whether they will be succeeded by independent Arab tribes owing possibly a nominal allegiance to the Imam of Sana. In this connection the case of the Amir of D’thala seems to call first for examination. The position of this Chief is mainly the creation of the delimitation proceedings. Before those operations the Turks had gradually encroached upon the area which was nominally his, and had reduced his posses sions to a fraction of the territory in which he has now been reinstated. The Amir’s prestige had diminished along with his dominions, and if the reports received during the past few years from our officers in the Hinterland can be relied on, he believes that he owes his present position to British intervention^ he welcomes the presence of the Political Agent and the British force, and6 he is convinced that he would suffer from the proposed withdrawal. Only eighteen months ago the Amir entered into a treaty by which he was assured that the British Government would extend to the territory of D’thala “ the oracious favour and protection of His Majesty the King-Emperor ” ; and two years a&lt;m the Resident expressed his conviction that our vacation of D’thala would immediately result in the Amir leaving the district and taking refuge in Aden or Lahej, as his position would become untenable. Such a result would lay us open to the charge of a breach of faith and of our treaty obligations. The comments of the'Bombay Government on this opinion, contained in a letter, dated the 28th August 1904, were as follows :—“ The Governor in Council cannot but feel that it would he an incalculable advantage if the Resident were placed in a position to reassure the Amir regarding our intentions. Such reassurance would in all probability not only strengthen the Amir’s position, hut would have a pacifying effect on the whole countryside. It is natural that so long as the tribes have reason to believe that our influence will be withdrawn in the very near future, they should maintain an attitude of expectancy and take up a position which will enable them to secure every possible advantage in the event of our withdrawal. The Amir’s position has been strengthened, and it will remain secure so long as we remain at D’thala”. In this connection we invite attention to the strongly expressed opinions of the Bombay Government and of the Resident, with whom we desire fully to associate ourselves. The cases of the Haushabi Sultan, of the Upper Yaffai, and of the Nawo, Rubeaten, and Dthabiani tribes are, as the Resident shows in paiagraph o of his letter, not widely different from that of the Amir of D’thala; and to abandon those who have cast in their lot with us and to whom we have promised our countenance and protection appears to us unwise even if it can he regarded as consistent with pledges we may fairly be considered to have given. There is thus a real danger that, if we now withdraw, we may be confronted in a few vears with an independent Arabia which will have lost faith in our abilitv or willingness to keep our promises to our friends, and which will therefore be contemptuous of or hostile to us. We submit that, at least until the issue of the present struggle between the Turks and Arabs is known, it would he impolitic in the highest degree for us to abandon our important post of observation and control at D’thala. 13. We have now attempted to show that the withdrawal of our troops and of the Political Agent from D’thala will, both from a strategic and political f point of view, gravely impair the strength of the fortress of Aden; while the i disadvantages expected by His Majesty’s Government to result from a retention of our position should, with the exercise of discretion and a loyal adoption or 1 the policy of non-interference, be easily avoided. On the general question we view with grave concern the policy of withdrawal from the responsibilities and obligations, which we have deliberately undertaken in the Aden Hinter land, as likely to cause us future trouble of a serious nature in that region. If Turkish intrigue and Muhammadan fanaticism are in the future to be ieit uncontrolled in that country, we fear that we shall before loag be involved m operations that might have been avoided by a firm and consistent attitude towards the tribes, and we would, therefore, deprecate the proposed change m policy as being, in our opinion, likely to bring about the very result that Mis Majesty’s Government desire to avert. At the same time we fully recognise that the shaping of a foreign policy especially in a matter affecting the European Powers must rest with His Majesty’s Government, but we earnestly trust that the decision of His Majesty’s Government upon this point may be reconsidered in the light of the facts and arguments which we have now ventured to place before you. In any case we would suggest that the present oppoituni y may perhaps appear favourable for further examination of the question ot tne transfer of Aden to the direct control of His Majesty’s Government, as I presented in our despatch No. 66, dated the 14th May 1903, to which we aye i received no answer. In that communication we pointed out the desirao i y 1 of uniting financial and political responsibility in the same hands; our °P ini .y^ 1 then given is fully confirmed by the subsequent course of events; and witn I the greatest respect for the views of His Majesty’s Governmen ne nowventure to express a hope that we may be relieved of the administration of the Settlement and Hinterland as we feel considerable doubt whether this can be effectively conducted from India if the step contemplated is finally taken.

Political Department. Bombay Castle, 13th July 1906. The Hon’ble Sir STEFNING W. EDGERLEY, K.C.Y.O., C.T.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay ; The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT or INDIA, Foreign Department. Sir, I am directed to reply to your No. 2413-E.B., dated the 12th June 1906, requesting that the Government of India may be furnished with a full statement of the views both of the Resident at Aden and His Excellency the Governor in Council on the policy which the Secretary of State has desired to he pursued in future in the Aden Hinterland, with special attention to the points detailed in that letter. I am to append a copy of the Resident’s letter No. 3851 of the 1st July 1906, and to offer the following remarks:— In the first place His Excellency the Governor in Council thinks it desirable very briefly to recapitulate some salient points of the correspond ence on the subject in recent years. In March 1902 the Government of India in their letter No. 516-E.A,, dated the 7th March, raised the question of the desirability, after the delimitation of the frontier of the Protectorate had been concluded, of amending and revising the arrangements then in force with some of the tribes or clans and asked this Government for any general recommendations they might desire to make in view of the altered circum stances which were likely to arise on the demarcation of the frontier. That letter was answered by this Government in their No. 5151 of the 14th July 1902, in which the internal independence of the tribes and their liberty to manage their own affairs was strongly insisted upon, and His Excellency the Governor in Council expressed the view that it was undesirable to formu late any fresh policy in dealing with the tribes near Aden, but that the growth of our friendship and the consolidation of our interests should be left to those natural forces which must naturally tend to that end. That view of the policy and aims of the British Government was accepted in the Govern ment of India’s letter No. 1856-E., dated 9 th September^ 1902. The question of our liabilities in the Hinterland was further discussed in my letter No. 2119, dated the 12th January 1901, and the policy recommended in letter No. 5151 of the 14th July 1902 was again pressed, namely, that the possibility of tribal co-operation and responsibility should be exhaustively tested and proved inadequate before any other policy was adopted, and I am to point out that it was clearly stated as the opinion of this Government that if the more active proposals then being suggested were adopted, it would not be possible in the circumstances of the Hinterland to draw back from what might be done. The views put forward in these letters were endorsed and enforced by the Despatch of His Majesty’s Secretary of State No. 15 of the 1st April 1904. The Secretary of State wroteI recognise the obligation which the delimitation may involve of performing certain friendly oilioes for tlio Turkish officers and in particular of restraining the tribes within the British Protectorate from committing offences beyond the border. In this view it m ay be necessary to impose upon the Amir of Dthala and other tribal Chiefs by fresh agreements international responsibilities which they have hitherto evaded.” And he went on to demur to any extension of our inter ference with the tribes themselves or any weakening the defence of Aden itself by exciting opposition in the interior and taking part in tribal disputes which CON HO) Government of India’s Despatch No. 3 63 Secret, dated the 31st August 1905. Secretary of State’s Des patch No. 35 Secret, dated the 10th November 1905. do not affect external relations. In the letter of this Government No. 30-M., dated the 18th April 1904, which was written before the above Despatch could he considered in Bombay, His Excellency the Governor in Council again pressed the desirability of avoiding any imputation of a premature and unnecessary interference with the internal independence of the tribes. His Excellency the Governor in Council, therefore, feels that he is at liberty to submit his views at the present moment without the risk of any imputation that this Government has been in favour of a forward policy in disregard to the wishes of superior authority. 3 . In May 1904, His Excellency Lord Curzon took the step of posting a Political Officer at Dthala, where he has since remained, and I am to state that while His Excellency the Governor in Council was not wdiolly in favour of that step at the time it was taken, yet there can be no reason whatever to doubt that the Political Agent’s presence at Dthala and also the presence of the British troops who are there in consequence is entirely acceptable to the Amir of Dthala and to the inhabitants of the Amiri territory. I am to invite attention to the Government of India’s telegram No. 3095-E.A., dated the 17th September 1904, which gives eloquent expression to the views of the Amir of Dthala on the subject. I am also in the same connection to point out that when the question arose of the policy to be followed by the Political Officer stationed at Dthala, His Excellency the Governor in Council in his No. 3861, dated the 20th June 1905, expressed strong preference for the policy of building up and supporting the authority of the Amir of Dthala and enabling him to govern the territory rather than of interfering directly and dealing with the subordinate Sheikhs ourselves. The policy there recommended of strictly confining the Political Officer’s activities to friendly advice and beneficent assistance was accepted by the Govern ment of India and the Secretary of State in the communications marginally* noted, and I am now to record the deliberate opinion of His Excellency the Governor in Council that as a result British policy in the hinterland of Aden is not only one of non aggression, but one which has been pursued hitherto with the full acceptance and good-w r ill of the Amir of Dthala wdthin whose territories the Political Officer has been posted. So far as the North-East portion of the Hinterland goes that represents the present position. 4 5 4. In the South-Western part of the Hinterland from Nobat Dakhin to Sheikh Said there has been latterly a somewhat abnormal recrudescence of inter tribal disputes and these have affected us in two ways, partly as resulting in outrages within that limited area of the Protectorate, similar to that formerly- known on the Somali Coast as the ten mile limit in which, as the Secretary of State lays down, disturbances call for interposition, and partly by raids across the frontier into Turkish territory which in the words of the Secretary of State’s Despatch No. 15 of 1 st April 1904 it has become one of our obligations to prevent. There has also been in the same region, ever since the tower of Auja difficulty, fear of encroachment of local Turkish officials and this manifested itself recently at Mafalis in the manner already reported to the Government of India. The accommodation of all these matters led His Excellency the Governor in Council to consider that some exercise of steadying influence was necessary and to make the proposals in my No. 1804 of the 5 th March 1906. I am to say that those proposals did not contemplate any violent action, but merely a deputation of officers to the country affected with sufficient authority to make an expression of the Government wishes through their medium respected and to cause the tribes to understand that the representative of British authority at Aden was able to enforce the language of admonition which he from time to time uses when occasion demands. 5 . Passing now to the questions in your letter under reply, it is only necessary to refer to your telegram No. 3905-E. A., dated the 17 th September 1904, to tbe Secretary of State, to his reply thereto, and to the Treaty subsequently concluded with the Amir, in consequence, on the 28th JSovember 1904, and to the subsequent course of events to make it clear that the Amir of Dthala willffli S tortCi 5 ab T i ^ r P ra -? 1 ''! it J! &lt;lra ^ al asa br each of faith and as a grave i qnq * , . am P 0111 ^ ou t that m 1905 Lord Lansdowne, whose views of the appointment tUe then Seove ^of State for India in making nt „ a , P ' m f ,m nt &gt;* ? tb v? Permanent and the Political Agent’s presence at Whala so fai from hemg likeiy to lead either to political or military entangle ments is hkely in the opinion of His Excellency the Governor in Council to prevent such entanglements arising. Already it has been necessarv to’ nehliho 61 ? /i Kpmr three of the boundary pillars recently erected in that eighbourhood and it is certain that the witlidrawal of our officer will lead to very great difficulties for the Amir of Dthala and he a grPat encoura' e- ment to all promoters of mischief both within and beyond the frontier recently ltH r Pnrot;ri Sly f the + ReSide A t W , iUbein 1 very much less advantlS SdrawalPf tip p rf- 0 '‘, f ancl to checkmate encroachments.

With regard t) the queftion tLVttf , 6 ? 1 &lt; | l f‘• &gt; ' ltldraw . a ! on tlle Power of control of the arms traffic, I am to say 1 esult is inevitably to confine our power of control to a sea patrol, and I 1906 ffiwhiffiftffi 1 ^ 1 ff P ara S ra Pbs 9 and 11 of my No. 1805 of the 5th March I960, m which the ineffectiveness of this method of dealing with the question is order^oMl ef' ^ mat * er „ th T e Resident will still have the benefit of the recent ?anft 1 4 • G ? vel ' n ™ e , nt of Illdla la fbeir No. 1956-E.

Wlt b . tbe help of the Aden Arsenal in a position to compete 11 illicit tiade from Jibouti, but obviously his position will be very much weakened by the absence of touch with tribes outside Aden. 6 . I am to say that His Excellency the Governor in Council considers it scarcely necessary to discuss the question of the effect of the orders on the health o e troops. Ihe Resident and General Officer Commanding has commented thereon m paragraph 7 of his letter and it is well known to the Government of India that the confinement of British troops to the limits of Aden itself has al ways been the cause of a heavy death-rate and extremely prejudicial to the effici ency of regiments posted to Aden. There is no doubt that a garrison which had i Wed t ° retain hs strength and efficiency in a sanitarium on the highlands of Hthala would be infinitely more fresh and efficient in point of health for the defence of Aden on necessity arising than one that had spent all its time in Aden itself. Trom a military point of view His Excellency imagines that arrangements whereby the troops as a body are kept in health and ^ood training at the inland end of a short Railway while a skeleton garrison con stantly relieved watches over the forts themselves is not only an efficient policy hut also a humane one. 1 ^ * 7. In connection with this subject, I am to invite orders on the subject of the Sultan of Lahej’s project for a Railway in his territory. The matter was last placed before the Government of India in my No. 1513 of the 24th Eebruary 1906, and I am to invite special attention to the fact that the Saltan has actually already given a concession for making such a Railway in his own territory. With the hope of making the undertaking somewhat more useful Government intervened to delay action thereon and have considered the possibility of giving the line entrance into Aden on certain conditions. If, however, the British Government decline to further interest themselves in the matter the question will certainly re-arise whether the British Government have any right to interfere with the Sultan’s administration of his own territories in such sense as to prevent him from going on with his original enterprise. There is no doubt the Sultan will regard our withdrawal from co-operation as an unfriendly act which has put him to loss. 8 8 . Turning from the past to the future, I am now to discuss the question upon the assumption that the Secretary of State’s Despatch represents, in the words of his telegram of the 19th June, the definite intentions and purposes of His Majesty's present Government. In that case I am to suggest for the con sideration of the Government of India that, when the Head Quarters of the Political Officer at Dthala are removed to Aden, it should be distinctly on the understanding that he can and should in accordance with a right given by ourWie- visit Lahei and Dthala freely and somewhat frequently. It is essential that the Resident should maintain a means of obtaining information as to the nosUion of affairs on the frontier, as to the condition of the boundary pillars, and as to the progress of the Amir of Dthala, whom we have launched on a course of rule from which there is, so far as he is concerned no turning back rnrnnh te disaster. The position, I am to suggest, should be very much Sat'recommendai ir^the letter No. 30-M. of the 18th April 1904 from this Goyernment. , 9 Concurrently I am directed to press strongly on the attention of the Government of India the absolute necessity of the adop^ cited in the closing paragraphs of my letter No. 1804, dated tne &amp;tn maicti 1906 and of extending that policy so as to include the Amir of D a a. To counterpoise the results of the withdrawal of our presence ana moral assistance 15 the subsidies to both these Chiefs should be very considerably enhanced That to the Sultan of Lahej should be so increased that he may be in a position at all times to assert unaided that supremacy in the South-West of the Hinterland which we have recognised as his prerogative ever since 1881. That to the Amir of Dthala should be so increased that he may be compensated (so far as we possibly can arrange) for the withdrawal of our assistance and support and be*enabled to exert freely the influence which money carries in the Politics oi; tbe Hinterland. 10 Bv some such means as these it might be possible, in spite of the withdrawal, to gradually reach the position of influence exercised ti.e witnarai g j th0 h placed before the Goverfment of India by this Government up to Ipril 1904. The success of such proposals will, of course, have been prejudiced by the subsequent posting of anofficer°at Dthala and his later withdrawal. But it is perhaps permissible still to hope that our officers may be able to consolidate a position with these two S which will enable us sufficiently to discharge the obligations which the delimitation may involve. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Signed) S. W. EDGERLEY, Chief Secretary to Government.security. There is no need that it should he made beyond the limits of Abdali territory, and difficulties of construction alone would, I think, preclude its being taken into the Dthala hills. 6 . Having stated my opinion generally, I now propose to consider in greater detail the effect of such a policy on— (i) the Amir of Dthala, (ii) the Hinterland tribes on the frontier and those through whose territory main caravan routes pass, (iii) the Turks and the Imam of Yemen, (iv) our ability to restrict the illicit arms traffic, and on their re-export to Somaliland, and elsewhere. With regard to the Amir 'of Dthala, it is certain that he would view with little less than consternation the withdrawal of our troops from Dthala. As a result of thirty years of Turkish encroachment and intrigue, his tribesmen have learned an independence and a waywardness that have estranged them from him. The moral support which the Amir derives from the actual presence of our troops in his country has done much to correct this, and will in time over come the reluctance to accept his suzerainty which constitutes his prime weak ness at present. Save for our presence in his country he would be unable to fulfil his treaty obligations qud keeping open the roads and protecting the traffic they carry. He is well aware that our presence in his country does not predicate any desire on our part to administer his territory, but the time when he will be able and willing to dispense with our support is yet too far distant to determine. Withdrawal at this juncture wnuld be disastrous to the Amir. (ii) The same applies in a different degree to the frontier tribes and to those through whose territory run the main trade routes. As an example I may cite the case of the Haushabi Sultan. This Chief is a young and inexpe rienced ruler of tw r o years’ standing who has no better example to follow than that of his uncle of infamous memory, who habitually coquetted with the Turks and alienated the sympathies of his tribesmen by his tyrannical rule. The realisation of Sultan Ali Mani’s hopes depend upon our presence in the country. He has an extensive territory coterminous with the Turkish border and some of the principal trade routes pass through his country. He has frequently complained of revenue aggressions by Turkish Arabs. These aggressions, though not serious in themselves while we are at hand to support him, would soon become so if we withdrew from the country. It should be recollected that even though the Turkish Government may desire, they have not the ability, to restrain their Arab subjects and intrigue and aggression will become chronic. Again the case of the Upper Yafai may be instanced. ^ There is here no actual demarcation of the border, nor may such be desirable just now. But the Yafai require the constant and close attention of the Political Agent. ^ On our withdrawal, Turkish political ascendency would follow on Turkish intrigue. The same may be said of the confederacy which comprises Juban, Nawa, and Dabiani which are all closely united in Arab politics with Upper Yafai. Juban, it has been allowed, is within the sphere of Turkish influence, while the restate within our own. Juban resents this decision and accuses us of bad faith and threatens to bring about the defection of the other three. If we withdraw, we shall everywhere be accused of surrendering Arab interests to the Turks aad our prestige will suffer proportionately. (iii) As to the effect of our withdrawal on the Turks and the Inam of Y emen it is not difficult to predict that the Turks would view our departure with unqualified satisfaction. It would afford them unlimited opportunities for intrigue and for the furtherance of their pan-Islamic programme. The Imam himself is no negligible quantity. The success that has attended his arms constitutes a serious menace to Turkish preeminence in the province of the Hedjaz and the two sacred cities. The Arab world on this side of the border is w r atcking with keen interest the conflict in the Yemen. The Imam may yt rule the territories contiguous to our frontier. It is well known that he has ftaddressed some of our Chiefs and their attitude is as yet uncertain. Those best able to gauge local feeling correctly are not prepared to endorse the opinion that the Arab Sunni and Shiah are hopelessly irreconcilable. It must be recollected that the whole of Yemen up to the port of Aden was once ruled by the Imam, and that some of the present Chiefs within our sphere are descendants from Viceroys of the Imams of Yemen. (iv) In regard to the effect of our withdrawal on our ability to restrict the illicit traffic in arms and ammunition, there is no doubt that with a recrudescence of disorder will spring up an increased demand for cheap arms. If we are not on the spot, we shall be unable to watch it or check its develop ment, and we shall be in even a worse position than we are now to prevent the re-exportation of arms to Somaliland and elsewhere. 7. So much for the political side of the question. Prom a military p 6 int of view, our withdrawal from Dthala must be regarded as wholly disadvant ageous. The station of Aden tends to become more and more crowded year by year notwithstanding our efforts to prevent it. The Isthmus barracks have been abandoned on account of their unhealthiness, and those at the Crater should be given up for the same reason. The climate and surroundings are such that no military training is possible, while opportunities for recreation are almost non-existent. The British troops there are simply rotting. Dthala on the other hand has a good climate and is exceptionally healthy, the men can be worked there all the year round, and their presence is acceptable not only to the Amir but to his people. We shall shortly be able to draw the supplies required for the troops largely from the country itself, with corresponding benefit to the people of Dthala and with economy to ourselves. I should like to see the regiment of Native troops now there withdrawn, and replaced by two companies of British troops. This would have the effect of reducing the garrison by six companies and at the same time would enable us to withdraw all British troops from the Crater. 8 . In conclusion I venture to deprecate any multiplication of our respon sibilities and any interference in tribal affairs in the Hinterland. But our presence there has, so far, been productive of nothing but good to the Chiefs and tribes under our protection, and this being so, having put our hand to the plough we should not turn back.Confidential. a. ble Sir STEFNING W. EDGEELEY, K.C.Y.O., C.T.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay; Political Department. To The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT oe INDIA, Eoreign Department. Sir, I am directed to reply to your No. 2413-E.B., dated the 12 th June 1906, requesting that the Government of India may be furnished with a full statement of the views both of the Resident at Aden and His Excellency the Governor in Council on the policy which the Secretary of State has desired to he pursued in future in the Aden Hinterland, with special attention to the points detailed in that letter. I am to append a copy of the Resident’s letter No. 3851 of the 1st July 1906, and to offer the following remarks:— In the first place His Excellency the Governor in Council thinks it desirable very briefly to recapitulate some salient points of the correspond ence on the subject in recent years. In March 1902 the Government of India in their letter No. 516-E.A., dated the 7th March, raised the question of the desirability, after the delimitation of the frontier of the Protectorate had been concluded, of amending and revising the arrangements then in force with some of the tribes or clans and asked this Government for any general recommendations they might desire to make in view of the altered circum stances which were likely to arise on the demarcation of the frontier. That ? letter was answered by this Government in their No. 5151 of the 14th July 1902, in which the internal independence of the tribes and their liberty to manage their own affairs was strongly insisted upon, and His Excellency the Governor in Council expressed the view that it was undesirable to formu late any fresh policy in dealing with the tribes near Aden, but that the growth of our friendship and the consolidation of our interests should be left to those natural forces which must naturally tend to that end. That view of the policy and aims of the British Government was accepted in the Govern ment of India’s letter No. ISSb-E.,^dated 9th September 1902. The question of our liabilities in the Hinterland was further discussed in my letter No. 219, dated the 12 th January 1901, and the policy recommended in letter No. 5151 of the 14th July 1902 was again pressed, namely, that the possibility of i y ^ tribal co-operation and responsibility should be exhaustively tested and proved inadequate before any other policy was adopted, and I am to point out that it was clearly stated as the opinion of this Government that if the more active proposals then being suggested were adopted, it would not be possible in the circumstances of the Hinterland to draw back from what might be done. The views put forward in these letters were endorsed and enforced by the Despatch of His Majesty’s Secretary of State No. 15 of the 1st April 1904. The Secretary of State wrote:—“ I recognise the obligation which the delimitation may involve of performing certain friendly offices for the Turkish officers and in particular of restraining the tribes within the British Protectorate from committing offences beyond the border. In this view it may be necessary to impose upon the Amir of Dthala and other tribal Chiefs by fresh agreements international responsibilities which they have hitherto evaded.” And he went on to demur to any extension of our inter ference with the tribes themselves or any weakening the defence of Aden itself by exciting opposition in the interior and taking part in tribal disputes which cox 4102 do not affect external relations. In the letter of this Government No. 30-M., dated the 18th April 1904, which was written before the above Despatch could he considered in Bombay, His Excellency the Governor in Council ao-ain pressed the desirability of avoiding any imputation of a premature and iinnecessary interference with the internal independence of the tribes. His Excellency the Governor in Council, therefore, feels that he is at liberty to submit his views at the present moment without the risk of any imputation that this Government has been in favour of a foru ard policy in disregard to the wishes of superior authority. 3. In May 1904, His Excellency Lord Curzon took the step of posting a Political Officer at Dthala, where he has since remained, and I am to state that while His Excellency the Governor in Council was not wholly in favour of that step at the time it was taken, yet there can he no reason whatever to doubt that the Political Agent’s presence at Dthala and also the presence of the British troops who are there in consequence is entirely acceptable to the Amir of Dthala and to the inhabitants of the Amiri territory. I am to invite attention to the Government of India’s telegram No. 3095-E.A., dated the 17th September 1904, which gives eloquent expression to the views of the Amir of Dthala on the subject. 1 am also in the same connection to point out that when the question arose of the policy to be followed by the Political Officei stationed at Dthala, His Excellency the Governor in Council in his No. 3861 dated the 20th June 1905, expressed strong preference for the policy of building up and supporting the authority of the Amir of Dthala and enabling him to govern the territory rather than of interfering directly and dealing with the subordinate Sheikhs ourselves. The policy there recommended of strictly confining the Political Officer’s activities to friendly advice ani beneficent assistance was accepted by the Govern ment of India and the Secretary of State in the communications marginally* noted, and I am now to record the deliberate opinion of His Excellency the Governor in Council that as a result British policy in the hinterland of Aden is not only one of non aggression, hut one which has been pursued hitherto with the full acceptance and good-will of the Amir of Dthala within whose territories the Political Officer has been posted. So far as the North-East portion of the Hinterland goes that represents the present position. ** Government of India’s Despatch No. 168 Secret, dated the 31st August 1905. Secretary of State’s Des patch No. 35 Secret, dated the 10th November 1905. 4. In the South-Western part of the Hinterland from Nobat Dakhin to Sheikh Said there has been latterly a somewhat abnormal recrudescence of inter tribal disputes and these have affected us in two ways, partly as resulting in outrages within that limited area of the Protectorate, similar to that formerly known on the Somali Coast as the ten mile limit in which, as the Secretary of State lays down, disturbances call for interposition, and partly by raids across the frontier into Turkish territory which in the words of the Secretary ot State’s Despatch No. 15 of 1 st April 1904 it has become one of our obligations to prevent. There has also been in the same region, ever since the tower ot Auja difficulty, fear of encroachment of local Turkish officials and this manifested itself recently at Mafalis in the manner already reported to the Government of India. The accommodation of all these matters led His Excellency the Governor in Council to consider that some exercise of steadying influence was necessary and to make the proposals in my No. 1804 of the 5 th March 1906.

Passing now to the questions in your letter under reply, it is on y v ' necessary to refer to your telegram No. S905-E.

With the hope of making the undertaking somewhat more useful Government intervened to delay action thereon and have considered the possibility of giving the line entrance into Aden on certain conditions If however, the British Government decline to further interest themselves in the matter the question will certainly re-arise whether the British Government have any right to interfere with the Sultan’s administration of his own territories m such sense as to prevent him from goino* on with enterprise. There is no doubt the Sultan will regard our co-operation as an unfriendly act which has put him to loss. 8 . Turning from the past to the future, I am now to discuss the question upon the assumption that the Secretary of State's Despatch represents, in the or so his telegram of the 19th June, the definite intentions and purposes of His Majesty s present Government. In that case I am to suggest for the eon- siderationot the Government of India that, when the Head Quarters of the 1 olitical Officer at Dthala are removed to Aden, it should be distinctly on the understanding that he can and should in accordance with a right given by our ) his original withdrawal from / 0 l u4 treaties visit Labei and Dthala freely and somewhat frequently. It is essential that the Resident should maintain a means of obtaining information as to the position of affairs on the frontier, as to the condition of the boundary pillars, and as to the progress of the Amir of Dthala, whom we have launched on a course of rule from which there is, so far as he is concerned, no turning back without complete disaster. The position, I am to suggest should be very much that recommended in the letter No. 30-M. of the 18th April 1904, from this Government. 9. Concurrently I am directed to press strongly on the attention of the Government of India the absolute necessity of the adoption of the policy advo- cated in the closing paragraphs of my letter No. 1804, dated the 5th March 1906 , and of extending that policy so as to include the Amir ot Dthala. lo counterpoise the results of the withdrawal of our presence and moral assistance, the subsidies to both these Chiefs should be very considerably enhanced. That to the Sultan of Lahej should be so increased that he may be in a position at all times to assert unaided that supremacy rn the South-West of the Hinterland which we have recognised as his prerogative ever since 1881. That to the Amir of Dthala should be so increased that he may be compensated (so far as we possibly can arrange) for the withdrawal of our assistance and support and be enabled to exert freely the influence which money carries in the Politics of the Hinterland. 10 Dy some such means as these it might be possible, in spite^ of the withdrawal, to gradually reach the potion of influence exercised through the Chiefs which was the object of the policy placed before the Government of India by this Government up to April 1904. The success of such proposals will, of course, have been prejudiced by the subsequent posting of an officer at Dthala and his later withdrawal. But it is perhaps permissible still to hope that our officers may be able to consolidate a position with these two Chiefs which will enable us sufficiently to discharge the obligations which the delimitation may involve.

DeBRATH, C.B., C.I.E., Political Resident, Aden; To The CHIEE SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of BOMBAY. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your No. 107-P., dated 16th June 1906, giving cover to No. 24 j 13-E. B., dated 12 th June 1906, from the Government of India, and to Secret Despatch*'No. 1 , dated 4 th May 1906, in which my opinion is asked on the subject of our withdrawal from the Aden Hinterland. 2 . The matter must be considered from two points of vfdw—(a) political and ( 6 ) military. Dealing with the political aspect first, our complete withdrawal from the Hinterland would, in my opinion, be shortly followed by a recrudescence of tribal fighting, lawlessness, and acts of violence on the trade routes; by an increase in the illicit traffic in arms ; and by an era of intrigue on the part of Turkish frontier officials. Those Chiefs who have thrown in their lot with us would lose all confidence in our policy, and once having lost it would never recover their faith in us. A decrease in the volume of inland trade with this port would at once follow as a natural consequence of the insecurity of the roads, and of our inability to supervise and control the levy of transit dues. 3. But if His Majesty’s Government do not regard these matters as important, and are prepared to withdraw from the protected tribes the benefits and assistance that they unquestionably derive from our presence, limiting the visits of the Political Agent to those occasions on which Turkish encroachment may render his presence necessary, then there is something to be said in favour of our complete and permanent withdrawal from the Hinterland and its affairs. This Residency would be relieved of an infinity of labour and correspondence with the tribes, and from a certain responsibility which now attaches to the assistance we afford to the Chiefs, while some saving may result in the grant for Durbar presents. 4. But between this course and that which we now pursue I see no middle road. By means of constant personal intercourse with the Chiefs and people the Political Agent, Dthala, and to a lesser degree the Resident, is able to win their confidence and regard. The Chiefs constantly appeal to us for friendly advice in the settlement of tribal disputes and we instruct them as opportunity offers in the principles of good government, and encourage them to develop the resources of their States. They readily draw comparisons between our methods and the malpractices and extortion practised by the Turks and the comparison is altogether in our favour, and will continue to be so as long as they have no reason to doubt our good faith, and the genuineness of our support. By these means we have legitimately extended and consolidated our influence and civilising power in the Hinterland. Both Chiefs and people are fully aware that we have no intention of absorbing territory or of assuming control of affairs within tribal limits. Our withdrawal from the Hinterland would undoubtedly undo all the good work that we have done there during the past three years. 5 . In regard to the railway through Lahej territory which the Abdali Sultan is anxious to construct, I see no reason why we should check his spirit of enterprise provided it will not affect Turkish susceptibilities. The raihyay would certainly prove a civilising influence, and would promote trade and con 410a• f V It Ibf ill !•»' security. There is no need that it should be made beyond the limits of Abdali territory, and difficulties of construction alone would, I think, preclude its being taken into the Dtkala hills. 6. Having stated my opinion generally, I now propose to consider in greater detail the effect of such a policy on— (i) the Amir of Dthala, (ii) the Hinterland tribes on the frontier and those through whose territory main caravan routes pass, (iii) the Turks and the Imam of Yemen, (iv) our ability to restrict the illicit arms traffic, and on their re-export to Somaliland, and elsewhere. With regard to the Amir of Dthala, it is certain that he w0 ^ view with little less than consternation the withdrawal of our troops from Dthala. As a result of thirty years of Turkish encroachment and intrigue, his tribesmen have learned an independence and a waywardness that have estranged them from Wm The moral support which the Amir derives from the ac ual presence of our troops in his country has done much to correct this, and will in time over come the reluctance to accept his suzerainty which constitutes his prime weak ness at present. Save for our presence in his country he would be unable to fulfil his treaty obligations qu&amp; keeping open the roads and protecting the traffic they carry. He is well aware that our presence in his country does not predicate any desire on our part to administer his territory, but the time when he will be able and willing to dispense with our support is yet too far ffistant o determine. Withdrawal at this juncture would be disastrous to the Amir. (ii) The same applies in a different degree to the frontier tribes and to those through whose territory run the main trade routes. As an exampie I may 6 citethe case of the Haushabi Sultan This Chief is a expe rienced ruler of two years’ standing who has no better example to follow t a that of his uncle of infamous memory, who habitually coquetted with t Turks and alienated the sympathies of his tribesmen by his tyrannical rule. The realisation of Sultan Ali Alani’s hopes depend upon our presence m the country. He has an extensive territory coterminous with the Turkish border and some of the principal trade routes pass thro 'S^ ^ 19 co un ‘ry. H e has frequently complained of revenue aggressions by Turkish Arabs. These aggressions, though not serious in themselves while we are at hand to support hfm, would soon become so if we withdrew from the country. It sbouid be recollected that even though the Turkish Government may desire, they have not the ability, to restrain their Arab subjects and intrigue and aggressi n become chronic. Again the case of the Upper Yafai may be instanced. There is here no actual demarcation of the border, nor may such be desirable just now. Hut tn Yafai require the constant and close attention of the Political Agent. _ Un o withdrawal, Turkish political ascendency would follow on Turkish intn ue The same may be said of the confederacy which comprises Juban, Nawa ana Dabiani which are all closely united in Arab politics with Upper Yafai. J uban it has been allowed, is within the sphere of Turkish influence, while the rest are within our own. Juban resents this decision and accuses us o ^ a threatens to bring about the defection of the other three. If we wi 1 * a ’ , shall everywhere be accused of surrendering Arab interests to e u our prestige will suffer proportionately. (iii) As to the effect of our withdrawal on the Turks and the Inam of Yemen it is not difficult to predict that the Turks would view our departure with unqualified satisfaction. It would afford them unlimited oppor uni intrigue and for the furtherance of their pan-Islamic programme. I he imam himself is no negligible quantity. The success that has atten e ^ 18 c ^ constitutes a serious menace to Turkish preeminence m the province ot tae Hediaz and the two sacred cities. The Arab world on this side of the bord ® r f* watching with keen interest the conflict in the Yemen. Ihe ^ ^ ^ rule the territories contiguous to our frontier. It is well known ia ^ &amp;addressed some of our Chiefs and their attitude is as yet uncertain. Those best able to gauge local feeling correctly are not prepared to endorse the opinion that the Arab Sunni and Shiah are hopelessly irreconcilable. It must be recollected that the whole of Yemen up to the port of Aden was once ruled bv the Imam, and that some of the present Chiefs within our sphere are descendants from Viceroys of the Imams of Yemen. (iv) In regard to the effect of our withdrawal on our ability to restrict the illicit traffic in arms and ammunition, there is no doubt that with a recrudescence of disorder will spring up an increased demand for cheap arms If we are not on the spot, we shall be unable to watch it or check its develop ment, and we shall he in even a worse position than we are now to prevent the re-exportation of arms to Somaliland and elsewhere. 7. So much for the political side of the question. Erom a military point of view, our withdrawal from Dthala must he regarded as wholly disadvant ageous. The station of Aden tends to become more and more crowded year bv year notwithstanding our efforts to prevent it. The Isthmus barracks have been abandoned on account of their unhealthiness, and those at the Crater should be given up for the same reason. The climate and surrounding are such that no military training is possible, while opportunities for recreation are almost non-existent. The British troops there are simply rotting, Dthala on the other hand has a goodTclimate and is exceptionally healthy, the men can be worked there all the year round, and their presence is acceptable not onlv to the Amir but to his people. We shall shortly be able to draw the supplies required for the troops largely from the country itself, with corresponding benent to the people of Dthala and with economy to ourselves. I should like to see the regiment of Native troops now there withdrawn, and replaced bv two companies of British troops. This would have the effect of reducing the garrison by six companies and at the same time would enable us to withdraw all British troops from the Crater. 8 . In conclusion I venture to deprecate any multiplication of our respon sibilities and any interference in tribal affairs in the Hinterland. But our presence there has, so far, been productive of nothing but good to the Chiefs and tribes under our protection, and this being so, having put our hand to the plough we should not turn back.Minute Paper.

The retention of a Political Officer at Dthali Was originally provisional. In Septembei 190T my Predecessor assented to the proposal of the Government of India “as a temporary measure, to “ retain a British officer and a small body ot troops “ a t Dthali.” This assent he limited to one year, requesting that after the expiry of that time he should he informed as to the existence of “any “ real necessity for maintaining the official and his “ escort at Dthali.” In November 1905, however, he accepted the reasons of the Government of India for making it permanent. In view of the change of circumstances which will be the result of the present instructions, His Majesty’s Govern ment are satisfied that the arrangement need not be regarded as a permanent one, and that it will be sufficient if the Political Agent is permitted to visit Dthali temporarily and for special purposes as occasion may require.

It appears to be supposed^ that the process of delimitation, satisfactorily carried out in concert with the Turkish Government in the Aden hinterland and establishing a definite frontier between the territories of the Sultan and certain of the tribes, brought with it an extension of the responsibilities and obligations of Great Britain. JLord Lansdowne, who was actively concerned in the transaction, explicitly rejected that construction of what had taken place. In the House of Lords on SOth March 3903, replying to a question whether the demarcation arranged with Turkey had enlarged the British sphere of influence, he said : “ With regard to the responsibility for these territories, I do not see why what has taken place should make any difference in these responsi- “ hilities. We have never desired to interfere &lt;c with the internal and domestic affairs of the tribes. On the other hand, we have throusrhout { ‘ made it perfectly plain that we should not “ tolerate the interference of any other Power with “ them.” In this interpretation His Majesty’s present advisers in the fullest sense concur. The security and strength of Aden as one of the main posts and fortresses that guard the line between England and India, must always be a standing object in national policy. That strength will obviously be impaired and not augmented by quarrels with the tribes, by intervention in their disputes, by multiplication of formal agreements with them; andmy any excessive readiness to resort S. . A ,i * i 1 H) / 1 JX^cXa. / l to expeditions out of all proportion, whether immediate or indirect, to either the occasions for them or to any clear advantage to be gained by them. 3. If, as His Majesty’s Government have decided, the main purpose of the recent delimi tation is achieved by the fixing of a line beyond which Turkish troops or agents cannot advance, I submit to your Excellency the following propo sitions as well fitted to carry out our decision. So far as the Tnrkish frontier is concerned, it is in the highest degree desirable that accidental advances should not be exaggerated, and our first protest would naturally be by way of action at Constantinople. Round Aden and. within the narrow limits of the protectorate^^ hire should ho drawn within which internal disturbance would naturally call for watchfulness, acts of violence on British territory would, of course, be punished promptly. Beyond that line our Agent should be careful to avoid every step that might lead us into military or political entangle ments, without the express sanction of the Government of India. A railway to Dthali and a cantonment or sanatorium there, should be considered as outside the contempla'ion of the Government^ X ~~ ✓ t 4. The retention of a Political Officer at Dthakf 4 , was originally provisional. In September 19(74 my Predecessor assented to the proposal of the Government of India “ as a temporary measure, to “ retain a British officer and a small body of troops “ at Dthala.” This assent he limited to one year, requesting that after the expiry of that time he should be informed as to the existence of “ any “ real necessity for maintaining the official and his “ escort at Dthal^d’ In November 1905, however, he accepted the reasons of the Government of India for making it permanent. /^Foi 7 my own part I can discover no further evidence of this necessity. If the Political Officer b/ withdrawn, there can he no advantage, andHrere are very^ obvious disadvantages, in maintaining the garrison of 883 men now stationed at Dthala. The reasons that were believed to demand me garrison in 1904 would seem now to have lost tjaeir force. JL JThe despatch of postal runners or agents of the British Government into the interior is to be as much as possible avoided. Any project for _ disarming the tribes in the nine ‘CentEes should he dismissed from serious consideration. Punitive expeditions for offences committed during the demarcation, and not punished then and there, are now out of the question. No demonstration along the demarcated frontier seems to he needed. -T~ tZL ^ °f~ ^ ^ Ti JZl \*-*-*~Z . ^ A as. ir Ct&lt;: 6 Jr e d- 1 / L PA. / t La XLm ^ r tv, A. ^ ^ ^ Z l /i ^ d x ^ e ~ i \s . ^ (S Irifr ^ x * 1 ' t &amp; tU l u t c —^ f\AA 6 .^L Irf’ust that-thuve propositions may com- mend themselvessAo yrjm?—dBxeeBency, either as matter/for/instructions to the Resident whom $ tx tr*Aj » far &lt;c Ul &gt;vCC^-ZTi^y^ixy^ ^ ^^p^r/rt (jt, (Z2jzVu&lt;Z) k U- ^ ^ India Office, London, 1906.

In continuation of my letter No. 725 datad fho am, • l . reference to your letter No 922, dated the 3nl instant I have he honouT to forward herewith copjes of translations of two letters received bvTnn hG wJu “ 1 th ” Iu ” li S1 ' il, “ “*«' “»Mr SJ Wz S5.' St ■ I 2 -' 1 h a - ls v att n ch 8 list * ? f th , e 1,084 which l las been returned. The manner in winch this has been opened and generally tampered with, of course, consider ably aggravated the offence I have heard from the Abdali Sultan in the course of the week that some Currency Notes were found in the post, and that the Attifls were arranging to send these to Jibouti to get them cashed. Of this I have at present received no confirmation, but the maiority of the nost was evidently gone through with a view to some such action. Accordino-to intormatwn which I have received the Mansab of the village of A1 Kadthi’ is himself not blameless in this particular matter. Most of the statements of which copies have already been forwarded Government were taken on oath before competent Magistrates, and I attach this week copies of the marginally noted statements similarly taken. I also attach copy of note of an interview held with the Mamai Sheikh and his son. 4. The Mamai profess loyalty to Government, but I am informed that all the M ahasha tribes, the Mamai, Juledi, Somati and other petty elans are, as a matter of fact, on terms of intimacy with the Attifi and Yusufis. And the attitude assumed by the Mamai at present juncture cannot be termed satisfactory. o. In regard to the Attifi s contention that the recent offence w r as com mitted in pursuance of a raid, I attach the statement of one of the most important leaders of the Ahl-al-Ban. Further inquiry will be made into the point. It may be admitted at once that hostility has for many years past existed between the Attifi and the Abdali tribes of which, of course, the Ahl-al- Ban is one. But this has been due to the lawless raids of the Attifi, and the raids of the opposite party have been by way of retaliation. I attach copies of the marginally noted correspondence which I have had with the Abdali Sultan on this subject in the course of the week, and I would invite reference to the 3rd para graph of General Maitland’s letter to your address No. 166, dated the 6th June 1903, bearing on this particular point. 3.

(3) Residency Office No. 787, dated the 8th February 1906. 7. The most important point for immediate consideration is what further action shall now be taken in the event of non-compliance with the demand which I have now rej-ieated to the Attili and Ifusufi Sheikhs. As already stated I do not anticipate compliance with the demand for the surrender of the con 1706—1 ° Printed on page Yh.2 offenders. And Go^nmen^the 2 direction in which expedition. 8 It is of course, open to me to deduct the value of the postman’s camel, rrLirffi s alone receive a regular stipend and that the small one wh.oh is distributed between the Sheikh of two distinct sections. 9 As pointed out in paragraph 7 of General Maitland’s letter to your address No. 112, dated the 23rd September 1901, the occasional plunder of a few camels with their loads would make up to any section of the Subelu the money value of the stipend and presents which they would ordinarily receive Som us, and recent events illustrate the truth of his statement that the Subehi care nothing at all for us directly.” 10. At the same time a certain amount of pressure can be brought to bear in the manner indicated and of simultaneous exclusion of the tribes from the benefits of intercourse with Aden and Lahej &amp;c. The ultimate result of such measures would, of course, possibly bo further offences on the roads necessitating the adoption of more drastic measures. 12. More pressure is gradually being brought to bear upon the Eijai, Makhdumi and Mansuri to effect the capture of Captain Warneford s murderer, hut as at present advised I do not consider it probable that these ordinary measures will have the desired effect. 13. In the 2nd paragraph of your letter No. 922, dated the 3rd instant, an assurance is requested that a sufficient force is available to compel success in the case of a combination in active hostility against the British Government by the several sub-tribes of the Subebi and possibly of others. This assurance I‘am prepared to give. In regard to whatever measures are taken against the Subelii we can certainly count upon the friendship and, if desired, the active co-operation of the Abdali Sultan which he would, I am sure, be pleased to give. And I do not anticipate any such general combination of the Subehis as to unduly tax the resources at my disposal. 14. As to the time of year for punitive measures they should be carried out at once and concluded before the end of March next or else they should he deferred till next November. It is clearly preferable that they should be undertaken at once. 15. As to the locality, nature and extent of the punishment to be inflicted, I would propose to despatch two forces from Aden, one known as the Northern Porce and one as the Southern Force. The Northern Force consisting or 1 men mounted on camels and horses would march from Aden to^ Dar-al- Kmdaimi vid Amrija where 50 men would he dropped to form a defensive post. The Southern Force would consist of 300 men with two mountain guns (2 V *5 B. M. L.) and two maxim guns and some Sappers with explosives. About 20 of these would he mounted for reconnoitring purposes ; the remain ing being on foot. This force would move by sea from Aden to Ras-al-Arra whence they would march to Dar-al-Kudaimi vid Turan and Bir-am- Mu’Ammaria. These two places would be held by 50 men each as defensive posts on the line of communications, and the remaining 200 men would combine with the mounted force at Dar-al-Kudaimi. The Commanding Officer a Dar-al-Kudaimi wmuld thus have at his disposal 300 men of whom 120 won he mounted, and two mountain guns and two maxims.v Qi an . uttimatum would be sent to the Attifl and Yusufi Sheikhs, and if demands, still remained uncomplied with within a speci fied period, raiding parties would be despatched into the surrounding country fo+hp 2^ a- 1 a J a . llable 1 } v ®“ s t 0 ck and to destroy crops and dars belonging to the offending tribes. A1 Kadthi being a place generally regarded as holy would probably not itself be destroyed. The treatment accorded to A1 Faira, oftlm'hffiaMtan^ 111 Turan of course ’ largely depend upon the attitude * y 17 ; 1 T1 1 0 are unfortunately a very nomad clan and have no really fixed abode to form the object of direct attack, and it is, therefore, not possible to accurately foresee the extent of the punishment which it may be possible to mulct upon them in the manner suggested. 18. Of course, should active opposition be met with from any of the other sub-tribes in the vicinity punishment would be inflicted upon them, the detail of which would have to be also decided by the Political Officer on the spot according to circumstances. 19. Necessary operations would probably not take long to complete, and the punitive force would then retire by the routes originally traversed. At Amrija I do not anticipate opposition, but reinforcements will, of course, be held in readiness at Aden ready to proceed there at a few hours’ notice in the event of necessity. These reinforcements would consist of European troops which are not included in the main expedition. 20, At Ras-al-Arra H. M. S. Proserpine should be stationed pending the return of the Southern Eorce, and prepared to render any special assistance which may be necessary. 21. Arrangements would, of course, be made by the Military authorities for supplies and to generally carry out the details of such an expedition. Letter dated the 3rd February 1906. From— Sheikh Ali ha Saleh, the Attifi, and Sheikh Saleh lin Saleh-am-Thol- tain, the Yusufi ; To—The Political Resident and his Assistant. We have received your letter by the hand of Sheikh Mashwal-as-Suwailmi in which you write about the raiders who had committed an outrage at Sheikh Othman. They were ignorant people and had left without our knowledge. They raided when we were absent from our country. Some of our animals were plundered by the Alkamis, and we went in their pursuit. They (raiders) resolved to make the raid after we left after the animals. They started to attack their enemies, but they do not know the places. It was not their intention to deliberately carry away your property or to offend against your children and they did not know that what you have mentioned in your letter to us would happen. You write us about the murderer; there is hostility between the Ahl-al-Ban and us from before and of olden times. They had killed the son of Rajeh Mohsin, and the persons who killed him were Ahmed Abdul Wahid, Jabr-al-Ban, and Mohamed Ubeed who has his dagger and gun. The Ahl-aLBan and the Abdalis attacked us again and killed the Akil of our country, Ahmed ba Saleh and Ali Ba Saad, the Yusufi. They plundered us of 40 she-camels and 60 cattle, but the Government did not think of punishing them for the loss of our relations and property. You write us about the limit. All the limits are belonging to Govern ment, we and the Abdalis are the subjects of Government; but if you consider that we are not in your limit, we want a certificate to be given to us to that effect. The post was robbed when we were away, and the Mansab had secured it until we came back. We have already sent it to you. We could not give it to any one before, as we were afraid of your punishment, but as soon as we have received your letter we have delivered it to the son of Saeed Jaffer. We4 inform you that there is no payment due for its recovery. We have given all that which we have received. Haidara bin Ahmed and his brother met our foolish people and asked them for something of the loot, so the saddle and saddle-bags were given to them. We are not aware what was there in the saddle-bags of the things of the post. Wh^-n fV»o raid took nlace Saleh bin Saleh Tholtain was in your We have sent the post with the son of Saeed Jaffer simply because Sheikh Mashwal is busy in the matter of the plunder which wasAaken away from us. As regards your letter to Sheikh Saeed ha Ali we have despatched it to him, and you will get his reply. ^ May you know of this. We send you this with Sheikh Haza bin Kasim Makbil. And salutation. Letter without date. From— Sheikh Ali bin Saleh ba Rageh and Sheikh Saleh bin Saleh-am- Tholtain ; To—The Political Resident, Aden. We have received your letter and its contents was known and understood. As regards the murder of A1 Majali bin Saif of Ahl Alban they precedented us bv killing the son of Rajeh Mohsin-al-Yusufi and carried away his property, rifle and arms. The culprits were Ahmed Abdul Wahid and Jaher Alban. We inform you that there exists between us (the tribesmen) murder and plunder since the time of our fathers and forefathers. They after having killed the son of Rajeh-am-Mohsin attacked us again and killed Ahmed bin Saleh ha Rajeh, the Akil of our country and the protector of the limits, and Ali bin Saad-al-Yusufi and carried away from them a very large property, viz., 40 she- camels, arms and 60 cattle. You write that all the limits are yours and that we and our enemies, the Ahdalis, &amp;c., are in your limits. Now if you will enquire, you might investigate the matter between us and we won t object, we are not obstinate. Those who created this attack, they have done it on their enemies, they had not started to offend against your property, but they had only gone against their enemies. We are all in your limits. If you say that we are not in your limits, we want a written document in our hands certifying that we are not living in your limits. You write to us about your articles ; they were taken by ignorant persons ; when it has come to us (Sheikhs) we have preserv ed what we have received. We did not trust any one to take it to you before fearing your punishment. We after having received your letter dated Tuesday, the 16th, which was received by us on the 7th of Al Hajja, we accordingly send you the post with the lad named Saleh bin Sheikh Saeed Jaffer-al-Mamai. Your lad Sheikh Saleh bin Saleh-al-Tholtain informs you that this had happened during his absence in your service ; he was not at the country; and salutation.

You have been a long time returning to us the post, and we are not pleased that this was not returned, as it ought to have been, at once and without waiting for even our first messenger to arrive demanding it. When our first messenger did arrive it should, of course, have been returned at once. We are much displeased at your delay. Now without any further delay return to us at once all other portions of the post which yon may have since found in the possession of the marauders, the camel of Maja’ali Sef, his jambia, and the saddle of his camel. As to the saddle you say that it was given to another Haidara dm Ahmed, the Kijai. We have, of course, written to the Rijai Sheikh about this. But the responsibility rests on you to return to us the property robbed from our servant by your young men. As to the young men we have already named them to you—- (1) Tugaish din Saleh-am-Thcltain, (2) Ahmed din Abdulla din Awadth, (B) Mahomed din Saleh ha Raj eh, (4) Saleh din Abdulla ba Jahia, (5) Hasan Saleiman, the Seyaili, and we have already told you to arrest them and to send them to us for us to inquire into their offence. We have received the orders of our Great Government to repeat this demand to you. And we write to say that the young men should be brought to us by you at once and without any further delay and handed over to us to be tried in our Court for the offence which they have committed. This demand must be complied with within 10 days of the despatch of this letter at the longest. This is a longer time than is really necessary, and it would be well for you to comply with our demands now as soon as you possibly can. We are already, as we have said, much displeased with your delay over complying with the demands which we have previously sent to you. As to what you say about the enmity between you and the Ahl-al-Ban, that is a matter which we are inquiring into and will in due course full}) considtr before passing any orders in regard to the murder of Maja’ali Scf. But your young men have raided our property from our servant in our limits, and for this offence we demand that you arrest them and surrender them to us for trial by our Court, cois 2ul0—2We would urge you for rSondLTwlthlhne^nd which the Great Government has now ordered U9 ^We send. 0 y^uTthis letter by the hand of Haza Kasim Mukbil, the Duheni, onr^ otp spnrl one cony of it to each of you. Letter No. 846, dated the 10th February 1906. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden ; To—The Abdali Sultan. We send you, oh friend, copy of a letter which we are to-day sending to the Attifis and Yusufis concerning the recent postal robbery at Sheikh Othman. 2 The Mamais who are in here now are evidently savage and rather ignorant people. We trust that they will commit no mischief on the roads. Tt would be well to warn your soldiers to be on the alert. 3 Please write at once to the Rijai Sheikh to whom we have already written ourselves that the murdered postman’s saddle should be at once restored to us by Haidara bin Ahmed. 4 Please tell us all yon know of the existence of a blood feud between the Attifi or Yusufi and the Ahl-al-Ban. The Attifis say that the son of Rajeh Mohsi was killed by Ahmed Abd-al-Wahed and that Mahomed Obed has his dagger and gun. Said Jaffer^ Sheikh of El Mamaia, states upon oath:—I heard two days after it happened that “ A1 Avatif ” had made a raid and attacked the Ahl-al- Ban,” killing one man, and carrying off the Sirkeri mail-bags. Then I went from Shireikh, where I was, to Kaviat-al-Kadthi where I found the Attifi and Yusufi Sheikhs, but the rest of the elan had gone to the hills, and, as the Sheikhs told me on my asking, had taken the mail-bags with them. I pointed out to them the folly of what their tribesmen had done and said that I was the friend of the British Government. As they did not hand over the bags, I returned home and wrote a letter to Ali bin Saleh and Saleh ba Saleh to the effect that until they returned the Government property none of their tribe would be permitted to enter my country. This was written on a Thursday, and the next day Sheikh Ali ba Saleh, Saleh ba Saleh-am-Tholtain, and the Mansab of A1 Kadthi came to me with two bags, one of which was empty and the other contained papers. After counting the papers before Sheikh ismail and Abdu Burai, they handed them over to me. I gave them a receipt for what they gave me ; the papers were much torn and damaged, but the Sheikh said they had received them in that condition from their young men. The Attifi Sheikhs also gave a letter contain ing a list of papers handed over by them ; this I have delivered in the Residency office, along with the bags and papers as received by me. I have a copy of the receipt which I gave, which I can produce : I do not remember the number of opened letters, but the number of unopened ones was 51. The camel is with Sheikh Ismail at A1 Kadthi, but I hear the Ahl-al-Ban are going to ranson it for $50. Before me, (Signed) A. H. Mosse, Lieut., Assistant Resident and Magistrate, First Class.

I arrived at A1 Kadthi on Saturday and found there Sheikh Ali ha Saleh, the Attifi, and Sheikh Saleh ba Saleh-am-Tholtain, the Yusufi I delivered one letter to each of these Sheikhs and said that ’the Government demanded the surrender of the murderers of the postal sowar and the return of the mail bags. They replied that as there was a blood-feud between the Attifis and the Ah]-ai-lkni (deceased s tribe), there was no reason why the men who imd kilTed Ai Maja’ali should beTianded over, three of their men having been killed previously by the Abl-al*13an, X said that was no reason for their people killing the man in British territory and warned them that the British mightf if angered, come and burn their villages. They replied that Government had taken no notice when the Ahhal-Ban had killed three Attifis and looted their cattle, and they did not see why they should interfere now. That the blood-feud was the sole cause of the present murder. They said they would be willing to submit to the British Courts provided the latter also punished the crimes committed against themselves by the Abdalis, but they had not least intention of surrendering the offenders under any circum stances. They told me that the mail bags had already been handed over to the son of Syed Jaffer-el-Mamai to take to Aden. They gave me a letter with their reply which I have brought and handed over in the Besidency Office. A third letter which was given me in Aden I gave to Sheikh Ali ba Saleh to send on to the addressee Sheikh Saeed ba Ali Attifi, who was not present at Al Kadthi. I was told that the deceased’s camel was with the Mansab of Al Kadthi, Sheikh Ismail, who was prepared to surren der it on payment of $60, but not otherwise. Before me, (Signed) A. H. E. Mosse, Lieut., Assistant Besident and Magistrate, Eirst Class. Aden, 10th February 1906. I interviewed Sheikh Saeed Jailer, the Mamai, and his son Saleh bin Saeed this afternoon. They said that they and the other Wabasha tribes, the Juledi and the Somati, and the sub-tribes Zufeti and Aufadthi lived in the south of the Wadi Maadin and that the Jorabis lived in the North. They said that they them selves possessed two villages, Shurej and Dhu Sabr, which were c J; &lt; j )S0 . e f c 1 other and lay between Wali Astani and Wali Abdur Baham. At Shurej they said that there were about 100 houses, at Dhu Sabr about 30. They said that their total numbers w r ere about 150 souls excluding children. Part of the Mamail were, they said, under Sheikh Ahmed Basus and there was another Sheikh Sakeh bin Ahmed. The followers of bheikh Ahmed-am-Thoman which was south-west of their villages and formed part of the same range as Masanna, but projected in the direction of bhawar. They said that the Attifis were now at Masanna in the hills^ and hadj;aken most or tueir ianus tuere. xu — i auu„i; and Am Ukarija. Their dar at Am IJkaria had been destroyed by the Abdali Sultan some time ago. In ordinary times also they grazed their herds near Jabalain, but now had driven them up into the hills near Masanna. Araira, they said, was cultivated land below Jabal-am-Thome and really belonged to them, the Mamai. The Yusufi were now also at Masanna. At the dar al What only an old man named What now lived. Ml I I i /8 They said that there was cultivation at the top of Masanna. The Attifis, they said, lived in the Kobt and had no settled abode. Am Fajara belonged to the Kulefi Bir Ali ba Jirja to the Buremi. Shawar was a Juledi village. II The Sheikh then proceeded to urge that the Attifis had sent in the hv him largely owing to his advice and he represented that he had proved himself in this matter the friend of Government and then proceeded to press for the orant of a stipend or anyhow larger presents^ than heietofore. He himself 'spoke pleasantly and was a somewhat nice eldeny man. His son Saleh Seed! a youth of about Id to 17 years old, was, however of a different stamp. He was a truculent, insolent young savage ana evidently beyond his father s control His father, the Sheikh, admitted this fact and that his son had already given him trouble by‘killing a man-one of the Humedi tribe. Whereas g the Sheikh admitted the fact that he had always been treated with due generosity and courtesy by Government and had always been on good terms the son declared bis intention of now making conditions subject to which the tribe would serve Government. He expressed himself dissatisfied with^ his &gt;ii i lt~ Ha had not vet arranged a suitable marriage fathers treatment, xxe sum tuat lie nau not yet 0 fnfna,, for him. He said in fact that he wanted to be now independent of his father and to have a separate monthly stipend of 10 rupees. The boy said that he could not read or wnte, but that God had blessed him with mtelhgenoe and that he proposed to hire a clerk and be a regular correspondent of Government and he granted a personal allowance of Hs. 10 a month for that service. I then had four of the elders of the tribe in. ^ They admitted that their Sheikh had been treated with due honour and friendship m the past but they urged that greater generosity was now needed to satisfy their needs. They wished to serve Government and to get a regular money payment instead of the occasional presents (about Rs. *00) a year now bestowed. When asked in what way they wished to serve Government they replied that they wished to protect their country and the roads in the vicinity from the Turks and also from marauders, such as the Attifi. They, however, agreed that there was nothing to fear from the Turks and that the Attifis had not of late made any attack upon them. I pointed out to these people that the Attifis had chosen them to be their messengers in sending in the recently robbed post in accordance with our demands, and I said that I was sorry that they had chosen the present oppor tunity to refer in ungrateful terms to their treatment in the past, and to urge their own claims and greater consideration. It was clear, I said, that they, like the Attilis, had troublesome young men to deal v\ith and keep in order. I only hope that they would be more successful than the AttitB had been of late. I informed them that I would, of course, represent their case to the Politi cal liesidcnt. Meanwhile, I said that the best thing they could do was to persuade the Attifi. of the necessity of complying with our demands for the surrender of all stolen property and offenders. I said that I felt sure that we should always continue good friends and that I would in due course inform them of any special services which might be required of them. Meanwhile, 1 advised them not to let the counsels of bred strong youth to unduly prevail. I then had a few words alone with the youug Saleh dm Saeed, one of the most extraordinary young savages I have ever met. He is stunted somewhat in growth, has small stumpy hands and feet and a mouth full of discoloured but serviceable-looking teeth. He had a belt of French cartridges and the usual jambia at his waist. Nothing would satisfy him but the Rs. 10 a month which he had asked for for himself. He refused to say good-bye. And in taking my hand he said that he demanded from the hand of Government Rs. 10 a month. When I said that I would see if I could find him some employment in the service of Govern ment, he said that he could only serve in his own country as he had suggested. 1 have never met anything quite so precocious before. He left the room without saying good-bye in the most insolent manner, and I then informed9 MS 'M ‘Mils the elders that unless this boy apologized and assumed a more reasonable attitude they could not expect me to recommend greater generosity towards their more responsible selves. Thus the interview for the day terminated. 9th February 1906. (Signed) E. de B. Hancock, Captain, Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden. % for redl idfife vld Go^' p.

The offenders were the five youths named by us in our letter to the Attifis. time immemuriai givou. uw yj*. Aden a certain man named Darid-al-Akrabi was killed by the Buremi at Hiswa. He was not of the Ahl-al-Ban. A Somati was also killed there. An expedition went against the Burema in the time of Colonel Hunter and Colonel Stevans. Certain dars were destroyed and 13 men were captured. Shortly afterwards the Buremi submitted and were pardoned. Then Hussein-am-Suffi interrupted the post between Aden and Perim and robbed it. Mahomed Saleh with the Ahl-al-Ban went against him. Some of the stock was raided. He was afterwards pardoned. There is no feud between us and the Attifi in particular. Saleh ha Rajeh, the father of Ahmed Saleh, and Ali ba Saleh ba Rajeh, the Attifis, killed a cousin of mine named A1 Haj bin Ahmed Eadthl a good many years ago. This A1 Hai was uncle of Ahmed Abdul Wahid. After that the Attifis used to come and occasionally raid our cattle. Then I married a Kijai girl. And then a truce was effected between us and the Attifi, which rested during the life-time, and Ahmed Sakeh ba Rajeh, the Attifi. This t rU ce was arranged through Ahmed Saleh ba Abdullah, the Rrjai. He was the eldest son of the Rijai Sheikh and is now dead. This truce lasted up to the death of Ahmed Saleh ba ilajeh, the Attifi. The verv last time that Saleh ba Saleh-am-Tholtain, the Yusufi, came to Aden he staged for some days with me at Sheikh Othman. We were then on good terms.' He kept Ms camel with my nephews and we gave him a saddle has • this was given to him by Abu Besa of the Ahl-al-Ban. 1 and Abu Besa arranged with him for the continuance of peace between us.

Mason, Political Resident, Aden; To— Sultan Sir Ahmed Padthl, K. 0. S. I., the Abdali. We have, Oh friend, received your two letters dated 21st A1 Kida 1323 (16th January 1906) concering the murder of the lad Maja’ali and your later letter dated 23rd A1 Kida on the same subject. We have written in the matter to the Sheikhs of the Attifis and Yusufis to demand the return of the mail bags and the surrender of the offenders and we await their reply. We also await further information from you and we expect to hear in a day or two the result of Sheikh Awadth bin Salim’s endeavour to recover the mail bags. We notice that in your first letter of the 21st A1 Kida you refer to hostilities existing between you and the Yusufi. It was, Oh friend, on the 19th August, 18th Jomad Akhar last, that you informed us that you had made a truce with the Attifis, and Colonel Scallon wrote to you on the 24th of that month expressing his satisfaction at the same, and also the hope that the truce would continue permanent and that the peace of the country would not again be disturbed. You informed us when the truce was made, and you should clearly, Oh friend, have also informed us at once when the truce was broken and the hostilities which you refer to began to again exist. We have, of course, reason to believe that the recent outrage about which we write was mainly the result of such hostilities and no doubt also connected with the death of Sheikh Ahmed bin Saleh ba Raj eh which your troops caused last May. J ^ * As you are aware, Oh friend, hostilities amongst our friends and stipendia ries are not pleasing to us. And from the present case the inconvenient consequences also appear. In future we trust that you will first take our advice before entering upon them, and you should, of course, inform us when hostilities commence again after a truce of which you have formerly told us.11 r ;u IJ01l9|ll ki Q m tkt aatill Oapt, ;o rw ace ^ Letter dated the 30th January 1906. From—Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl, the Abdali; To—The Political Resident, Aden. We have receive! your letter No. 415, dated the 24th January 1900 I„ rep y we inform your honour that we had intimated to you in our letter of 18t 1 Ima(i ^ kll ° r ( 19tl1 August 1905) the period of the truce, and the reply of Colonel Scallon confirms our statement concerning the specified period. This, therefore, was a sufficient announcement of the commencement and termination (of the truce). 2. When did the Attifis and Yusufis had fulfilled the term of a truce or an agreement ? We have simply concluded the truce owing to your persis tence m view of their entering into Aden. They visited Aden, and no sooner they departed they violated the truce by their carrying off the camels, &amp;c near Am Shu’aibi as we had apprised you in our letter dated 13th Raiab 1323 (12th September 1905). After this incident Sheikh Ahmed Ali, the Attifi carried away a camel load of Kat from Kazan as we had written vou in our letter dated 16th Rajah (15th September 1905). Please refer our letters which will show sufficient proof of the violation of the truce and outbreak of hostility. 3. We are much surprised at your mentioning the killing of Ahmed Saleh ha Rajeh and did not refer to our tribesmen who were killed by the Attifis and Yusufis. d. In regard to truce and hostility that we should not make with certain tribe except after consulting you, we realize no result of the reports of the various deeds committed by the Subehis since the death of our late brother Sultan Padthl bin Ali up to date which were duly communicated to you. As to permanent peace if such could be effected, we do not dislike it. You state, moreover, Oh friend, that the outrage recently committed undoubtedly had connection with the death of Ahmed Saleh ha Rajeh who was killed by our soldiers. We hope that your honour will draw your attention to the outrageous act perpetrated by them and the murder of Makhraz within your limit, and the plunder of all his camels during the life-time of the aforesaid Ahmed Saleh (ba Rajeh). 5. It is necessary for us to address you regarding every misdeed perpe trated by all the Subehis on the limits and routes as they are your allies and under your protection. And your aid, such as stipends and presents, has been unceasingly granted to all the Subehis. You may instruct them to abstain from committing transgression on the limits and routes. Unless you punish or give us a suitable assistance for chastising them they will not cease from com mitting such acts. As far as we are concerned we are not responsible except for the acts perpetrated by our tribesmen on the routes only. Please refer treaty No. 35, dated 18th June 1834, treaty No. 36, dated 11th February 1849. It appears from your letter that you wish to impose the fault on us in favour 6.

From—The Political Resident, Aden ; To—The Acting Chief Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. In continuation of my letter No. 552, dated the 28th ultimo, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the further information of Government, translation of a letter which I have this week received from the Abdali Sultan. ’ 2. A copy of my letter No. 524, dated the 27th ultimo, to which this is a reply, has already been forwarded to you with my letter No. 550, dated the 28th January 1906. And I herewith forward copy of the reply which I have addressed to the Ahdali Sultan in reply to his letter. 3. The Juberi are a small nomad clan of Subehis numbering about 60 men only, and it is doubtful whether their correction really necessitates the outside mercenary assistance which the Abdali proposes to enlist for the purpose. It is, however, possible that corrective measures may elicit some form of opposition from other nomadic sub-tribes in the vicinity. 4. ^ There would appear to he no question that the Abdali Sultan is now primarily responsible for the general safety of the roads up to and including Nohat Dakim. But it is to be observed that, as will appear from General Maitland’s letter No. 248, dated the 25th September 1903, this is not the right occasion upon which the Juberi have relieved their feelings and their lawless tendencies by firing on the post of Nobat Dakim. And it is to be considered how far it is desirable that this tendency should now be checked and to what exteut it is desirable that the Abdali Sultan should at the present juncture be encouraged and assisted to undertake their correction. 5. From the attached copy of a memorandum dated the 3rd instant received by me from the Political Officer at Dthala it would appear that the Abdali Sultan whilst anxious generally to obtain the support and material assistance of Government does not plead actual inability to deal with the present situation unaided. At the same time it is clear that he is anxious to take the pesent opportunity to claim assistance under the terms of the treaty dated the 18th June 1839 which was ratified by the Governor General in Council on the 24th October 1839 and which provides for the British and the Sultan making common cause “ in the case of any attacks upon Lahej or the the Abdali tribe.’ , 6. I accordingly have the honour to solicit the early orders of Govern ment as to the reply which shall now be made to this demand. 7. In Government of India letter to your address No. 516-E.A., dated the 7th March 1902, assistance towards his operations against the Subehis was denied to the Ahdali Sultan, and in their letter No. 1890-E., dated the 15th August 1903, the view was expressed that assistance need not be rendered as the raids then under reference were not connected with depredations on the trade routes. Your letter No. 8642, dated the 23rd December 1903, referred to the desirability of sach measures being taken as would enable arrangement to be inaugurated which would permanently safeguard the trade routes into Aden and would enable me to submit proposals for establishing the Sultan of Lahej in positions which would enable him to effectively fulfil his responsi bilities as to the trade routes and security of travellers in the Subehi country. In Government of India letter to your address No. 464-E.A., dated the 10th coh 2011—12 TVhruarv 1904 it was remarked that Government felt not only entitled but eaUed won to insist upon a greater immunity to the caravan routes passing thioush Amiri territory between the Interior and Aden, and it was also ^ riLl t^nl some form of levy might ultimately be required to keep the ^ Jd in Govermnent of India Despatch No 130, dated the 21st July noni * address of His Majesty’s Secretary of State, it was pointed out thaif* despite 6 considerable stipends paid to several Chiefs order had not been preserved outrages had disturbed the security of the trade routes and our had been unable to enter tribal territory without a strong escort or S payment for the right of passages and that we had had to remain m ignorance of trite ^ ^ ^ dat(jd tbe 23l , d September 1904, His Majesty’s Secretary of State remarked that in his view British interference with the tribes f ,, THnteriand should be restricted to the minimum necessitated by obhga- r th Wards the Turkish Government and that the protection of the trade routes wTs o d ne o to duties common to all the tribes which the British Govern- ^pnt must he prepared to enforce.

The view has also been expressed by this Residency that at the present time it is more desirable to liberate the Haushabi from his position of nominal dependence upon the Abdali than to strengthen the authority of the A Mali oyer the Haushabi This view was expressed with special reference to Mr. Wood s letter to your address No. 1856-E., dated the 9th September 1902. 10 Recent events at Nobat Hakim, the recent postal robbery and murder at Sheikh Othman, and the Abdati Sultan’s renewed requests for assistance appear to render it necessary to now again consider and, if possible, to decld e upon the policy which shall henceforth be pursued m the Aden Hinterland in regard to offences which interfere with the peace of the roads or affect either British or foreign subjects. I refer to such offences as the murder of Captain Warneford at Am Rija, the murder of a Hunkah, Italian subiect in Attifi territory in November 1904, vide this office letter No. 5762 , dated the 24th September 1905, the recent murder of a Somali in Makhdumi limits and offences directed either against solitary travellers or trade caravans. 11. I attach to this letter a list of the various offences perpetrated by the Subehi since 1901, when a similar list was forwarded to Government by General Maitland with his letter No. 112, dated the 23 r d September 1901. Of these some have been brought to notice by the Abdali Sultan and may be held to ,• lit m Qnfl nthprs have been renorted irom various other sources. 12 It will be observed that in his memorandum dated the 3rd instant, of which a copy is attached, Major Jacob has referred to certain previous corres pondence on tbe subject of tribal levies. And I now have the honour to attach, for the consideration of Government, 8 n0teS ’ datedthe31st Aq ' copies of the marginally noted eompara- gll This office Nos. 6615 and 6616, dated tively recent correspondence on this the ^8th August 1905. subject. Certain of the points raised in Major Jacob’s memorandum, dated the Jacob’s notes of the 31st August 21st January 1906. 1905 have been already disposed of, or treated separately. The portion to which reference is now invited are only those referring to the general questions of order on the roads and tribal^ levies. Similarly in regard to his memorandum of the 31st ultimo attention is only invited to those particular questions. TV -Api-endix A.July * ) tries olige- lies ertie nurlii 13. The various detai s of Major Jacob's proposals I do not propose to here enter into. These will be remarked upon later, if desired, ibr^the present I would only invite consideration of the general su»&lt;mstion that at, various posts along the roads Native Levies should be posted and charged with casual 'offenders. 01131 ' 11 ^ t0 GoyemmeHt of ^feguaJding travellers’ against refe ? his Proposal as «an embryonic form of tribal levy. It will be observed that he leaves certain fixed responsibilities for portions of the roads to some of the Chiefs whose territories are traversed and that it is only at certain places upon the Aden-Dthala road that he suffffests small garrisons and occasional patrols of Native Levies. I am inclined to think that it would prove feasible to, in due course,. extend the levy scheme so as to embrace that portion of the community which at present earns fees from passing caravans by acting as “ Mukadams ” or guardians on the roads. 15. Such a levy could occasionally be made use of to administer correc tion as well as to maintain order, and their use for such purposes should prove generally a more simple and less costly undertaking than the use of more regular forces. This would apply particularly in the Subeki country where water is scarce and wells are distant from each other. The operations of such a body would perhaps in some cases be somewhat of the nature indicated in paragraph 13 of my letter No. ^&gt;56, dated the 28th ultimo, and assume the form of a sharp counter raid upon marauding parties. There would at any rate be available a mixed body of different tribes and clans in the actual service and pay of Government and ready to act promptly upon emergencies such as those under immediate reference. 36. I take this opportunity to submit these proposals for the consideration of Government, but in doing so I would not recommend that either the Abdali or the Amir of Lthala or the Haushabi Sultan or any other of the regular and more important Chiefs of the Protectorate should be freed of responsibility for the safety of the roads lying within the limits of their own territories. 17. I would, however, recommend that these Chiefs’ responsibilities should be limited to their own territories and that in the Subehi country and in various other portions of the Protectorate where the rule of no single Chief is at present effective, measures should now be taken to more firmly establish our own influence rather than to establish that of individual Chiefs who have in the past consistently displayed their inability to maintain the requisite order. I would urge that where the Abdali Sultan now periodically engages Yafai and Aulaki mercenaries from the East with a view to his own ends and for general purposes of correction or retaliation, a regular levy in our own employ, more or less on the lines suggested by Major Jacob, would be preferable and more consistent with our position as the Paramount Power. 18. Meanwhile I would solicit the favour of early orders as to the precise nature of the reply which should be made to the Abdali Sultan’s claim to assistance under the terms of the old treaty of 1839. ■i I *4 9 Oh friend Ton have referred to the matter concerning the firing of , t 2 V- Uil tne a, nw Qnldierq at Nobat Dakim as if it did not appear to the Jabira on yonr a No . 415 dated the 24th January 1906, to ou“ddSTo» Vetoed to the case as “ an outrage committed at Nobat Dakim.' An outrage ^means) is an act of the gravest nature thus is there anything graver than killing lives and plundering the properties of the travellers on the route ? a You state that the acquisition of Nobat by us imposes various obliga tions oh friend, we are not responsible for anything after we do our utmost efforts Our utmost effort is to keep soldiers in it (Nohat) and we have already garrisoned it After keeping soldiers on our behalf in the posts what responsi bility could there be whilst we have done all we can ? 4 We shall not allow the Juberi to escape punishment even if there would' be any killing and fighting between them and us. We have requisi tioned for soldiers from the Mashrik (East) and we expect them after the Id with a view of punishing them (Juberi). We will do the utmost we can. But to decisively put an end to the transgression of the Subehis and others on the wute does not appear that it could be effected unless you will materially assist us for punishing all the marauders by your force winch all persons regard it with terror. 5 You state that you are surprised at our quoting the old treaty of 1839. We have not mentioned the treaty in respect of this matter alone, but we have alluded to it because we observe that you are not paying attention to the misbehaviour of the Subehis, such as the killing of lives, plundering properties and intimidating the travellers since 1315 (1888) to 1323 (1905-06) during which time we have been reporting to you all matters, but you have neither punished them nor have you supported us for punishing them. Please send us an answer to our letter dated 27th Al Ki’da 1323 (22nd January 1906). Letter No. , dated the February 1906. From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident, Aden; To—The Abdali Sultan. We have, oh friend, received your letter dated the 5th Al Hijja con cerning the recent Jubori outrage at Nobat Dakini. It does not seem worthwhile to argue about the precise signification of the word outrage. The Juberi attack was, of course, an impudent affair, but it was not a very for midable attack and the Juberi are but a small clan. We have no doubt that you will be able to correct them and to keep order on the roads without any very great trouble. You are, of course, the best judge as to the necessity of enlisting forces from the East. As to your responsibility for the safety of the roads, it is hardly necessary to remind you that now that you have taken charge of Nobat Dakim the responsibilities—which formerly rested with the Haushabi Sultan and to which you have always been yourself the first to draw attention in the past, now devolve upon you. These are not, of course, confined to posting a few soldiers at a certain post, but effect the general safety of the whole road up to Nobat Dakim. As to the deeds of the Subehi generally, oh friend, we are aware that some of them have from time to time given trouble. Similarly, some ^ of them have from time to time suffered. We are paying due attention to their actions and, as we have already informed you, we are bringing the same again to the notice of the Great Government. Meanwhile we trust that there will be no further trouble on the roads which are under your special charge.Memorandum dated the 3rd February 1906 by Major H. F. Jacob Political Officer, Dthala. Proposals hitherto before Government have related, I believe, exclusively to the policing and patrolling of the newly demarcated Turkish border. This Government have not approved. My own views accord entirely. By reason of the interests common to both parties in places across their several borders, there are bound not infrequently to be cases of petty annoyance. 1 refer K As Salamh^AmSr “ m ^ Viciaity of Kataba ( Turkish ) The Amir of Dthala has by Treaty stipulated to protect his pillars, and the creation of Levies to secure this end appears superfluous. If after reasonable trial he be found wanting, the Amir’s protective arrangements may be discussed afnd replaced by sounder methods. As to watching those limited borders I am of opinion that time is the best agent to educate the Arabs on both sides the border in the distinctions of meum and tuum, and that if the Political Officer lived at Sanah (Amiri), through which place in times of peace pass some of Yemen s richest caravans, not alone would encroachments tend to decrease of potential grounds for complaint fail germinate, but also we should that entente and good-will on the frontier whereby trade would be facilitated and the “ pari passu ” pacification of the more turbulent and but little known of the cis-frontier tribesmen on the North-East boundary would be a foregone conclusion. To sum up : Place the Political Officer at Sanah (10 miles from Dthala); insist he shall know both Arabic and Turkish—Many of the Turkish Civilians are exiles from whom and could I but talk Turkish, learnt at Istambul, my influence across the border would be incalculable. Again, the Political Officer should prelerably be single and he expected to make an indefinite stay in the Hinterland where changes of personnel give a set-back in every quarter. Another and ancillary factor that will work silently but powerfully for rest on the border is the recently authorised Arab Hospital. Both on humane and also on political grounds the invaluable lesson to be learnt by Subehi marauders and Arabs generally, were it known that misdemeanours on the trade routes, whatever their origin, affected us both equally ; and that the British Govern ment, in this early period of their forward and pioneer policy inland, must be quick to perceive the importance, plus attendant economy, of combination to further a community of interests. He dwelt on the possibilities of our predicament in the event of an assault on Aden by sea, when, cut off from sea borne supplies, we became dependant solely on the products from Inland. He asked how it was possible to guarantee a continuous supply from this source go long as trade was not sedulously promoted now in times of peace ; that the forwardness of the Subehis and the perpetual apprehension of disturbance from this quarter made his, and other peacefully disposed, people shrink from agricultural pursuits to the extent the country was able to offer if perfect security were the order of the day. Let the co-operation be however small, but co-operation and the co-operative spirit was a desideratum. I relate this conversation, for it will prove of interest to Government and is illustrative, furthermore, of the principle I have so strongly urged Government to adopt in the matter of Tribal Levies along the present main trade route to Dthala. Let us take the tribes into our confidence, and we may remove our more expensive posts on the line of communications. Said Sir Ahmad “ I am, with you, the executive part of Government.” I am very sure this is a sentiment we cannot too strongly encourage. Our interests are identical with his. It is better to work the many through the medium of a few, and this policy is feasible where we have a ruler of the calibre of the Abdali Sultan. His influence extends throughout the Hinter land. He has marriage ties with Upper Yafa. By the liberality of his presents to all and sundry he has earned the style among the Arabs of “ our father,” and is consulted wherever our influence is now in process of extension and yet still further. Where we have means of Government so economic and easily negotiable, it is surely wiser to co-operate than to take up the reins and drive qon 2011—2nnacli alone. If the Abdali is enriched by the process, and even this be bis end in view, the net result is satisfactory. A rich and prosperous neighbour is the more securely united to us, and we shall be able, the more be depends on us, the better to direct the policy we wish to pursue. In the matter of the postal runner and the Atifi Subebis, the occurrence took place in our limits, and if punishment is decreed by Government, we should not be too keen to secure Abdali co-operation unless be press for this on the plea that bis tribesman was murdered. The two cases of Nobat Dakim and Sheikh Otbman are not on all four?. In the former, we would shrink from the veriest appearance of dissociation from treaty engagements, and would emphasise our friendship for a house which has been foremost to court our friendship and whose attitude towards us we have signalised by substantial favours: in the latter, we should demonstrate our readiness to avenge a personal insult: to show we are unwilling to delegate our duties to another; still less to stand aside till that other assist us, or, if we take no measures in person, himself come forward to avenge his own. Memorandum No. 84, dated the 4th February 1906. Powarded with compliments to the First Assistant Resident, Aden, for the information of the Resident and in connection with my recent report made from Nobat Dakim Confl. No. 51 of 25th January 1906. (Signed) H. F. Jacob, Political Officer, Dtbala. Some Political aspects of my tour in the Haushabi country—(Captain G. A. F. Saunders, R.E , D.A.A.G., accompanied me). 1. I found Sultan Ali Mani apparently quite reconciled to the official recognition of his choice recently made at Nohat Dakim to adhere to the agreements entered into by his predecessor with the Abdali Sultan; he remain ing at the same time a ruler who had direct treaty relations with the British Government. In this case it is well to abide by the trite maxim of ( quiet a non mo vere ’ 2. I had lengthy interviews with the Sultan. I specially discussed his relations with the Dthambaris and the responsibility resting on him to keep order in his borders and ensure security ou the trade-routes passing through his dominions. ’Ali Mani ’ reminded me that there lie within his territory, which is, moreover, very extensive and sparsely populated, seven trade-routes and that it was practically impossible for him unaided to a guarantee peace and order along their entire lengths. This is factor to be considered when we come to appraise the Haushabi’s police control of his districts. The routes he has to safeguard are :—(I) A portion of the Wadi Tiban route md Lijma, and al Qam’a, (II) The Mashwara, (111) Mawia via Nashamm and Wadi Warezan, (lY) That of all Millak. (V) Wadi ’Akhan vid Jol Madram, (VI) That between the Wadis Tiban and Warezan, c illed Mahsus, going to Qaddas (Turk), (VII) Dar Shaihan or Ramla road behind Jabal Munif, All these routes are well traversed. I spoke to him about the eight camels recently looted near Al Millah. He said that the Haushabi, Saiyid Fadthl at ouee went to the Dthambaris to demand restitution and pledged three rifles with them. They claimed in addi tion $ 500 and the return of the two camels formerly plundered from them by Haushabis. The Saiyid pointed out that he had an oflset to this claim, viz., four camels raided some little time ago from Haushabi subjects, but the Dthambaris ' would not listen to his overtures. The Saiyid and another, one ’Obed ’Umar, the Kazi of Raha, are stiil negotiating.mferfm* mm ' 3e froi selvef'^riatt^ l™ constant !y at P^^er amongst them- • e i S ‘v 1 6 i ia 1 ter Sa ^ “ ie Haushabi on accession sraye them no nresonts anrl it is believed, whatever the cause he of their animosity, that hy these reprisal on the trade-route the Dthambaris wish to blacken ’Ali Mani^face/ ’ I do not understand how ’Ah Mam’ will stop these raids on that particular route unless he he allowed to garrison al Millah with 4,0 or 50 men. This is his Wish if given by us a fair number of rifles. The proposal is a good one, and will enable us to relieve the detachment there. Doubtless, the levy system is the very best we can devise all along the route. By it we put cash into the pockets df the people and give them an interest in preserving order. The Dthambaris feel themselves out in the cold. They are marauders from their youth. Give them some remunerative work which, if faithfully carried out, will further tend by the increase of trade to relieve their present impoverished condition and they will prove fast and useful friends. On the other hand, reprisals in the form of pumtiye expeditions work temporary wonders only, and in their train rancour and ill-will in perpetuity. I would encourage the fraternisation of these two peoples by establishing, as soon as we can, mixed posts of Haushabis and Dthambaris on the Habil Shams. In the interim some action is necessary to reduce the number of these oft-recurring misdemeanours. I would recommeud what^ the^ Haushabi Sultan and ’Alawi Sheikh have urged. I have myself practised it uith the Sha iri-tribe near Dthala. It is the well-known plan of blockade. I propose to shut out all Dthambaris from Dthala, Lahej and Aden till the loot now taken has been restored. This punishment has the merit of being such as the Dthambaris can terminate as soon as they will. Its duration is in their hands. Its inclusive scope serves to bind the clansmen together. Where a few misbehave, the whole are made to suffer. They will see that the well-being of the community at large is dependent on the' good behaviour of each and every section. In Somaliland we used also to keep as political detenus in Berbera what were called “ goodmen,” i.e., men whose detention was felt by their fellows who would hasten to redeem them. The ransom figure was the value of the loot taken. It was not necessary that these detenus should be in any way connected with the crime. Saiyid Eadthl bin ’Alwai, an influential man of the Badfan country, himself advocated this system and says all the Chiefs en route would gladly combine. I strongly approve. 3. As to the dia due for the Bada’i murder. The murderer is at lar^e and his whereabouts unknown. I again impressed on the Sultan his responsi bility in the matter, and that he could not expect Turkish co-operation unless he himself set a good and prompt example. I told him I would not ordinarily interfere with blood-feuds in his own limits, off the trade routes, in cases where his own subjects exclusively were concerned, but that this particular case was outside his purview to settle as he thought best, and that the sum of $ 300 must be handed over to me. This he promised to do at once. He would, if necessary, deduct the same from his dues drawn at Lahej. I left him to deal hereafter with the property of the murderer in Haushabi limits. 4. On my way to Ad Dareja I w 7 as accosted by Nash* bin ’Ali, the Akil of Mabrak who complained of the Turkish subject across the border, the al Wajihi. I instructed the Sultan to make a specific complaint in writing. the caravans to Dthala should be diverted through Musemir, along the Makhran the Wadi Tiban route used by the Amiri tribes of the Hamada and AhmedSf, and also the Karabi (Turkish). I do not set much value on his suggestion, but introduee it because of the I am sure this is the end to which we must work. There is no other way to check excessive and illicit dues. The focussing of the collection at one place is '. 4 Ic Whilst at Musemir I heard of the presence two miles (at Dahana from Mama o£ Muhammad Nasir Mukbil who lias given so much trouble on the Hausbabi border. The news I received was to the effect that he has a small following of 40 men and was “ sitting on the fence watching the probable outcome of the Turks) Imam quarrel. I accordingly went to Mawia after receiving an invitation from the Superintendent of Customs there and spent an hour in his company. I was fortunate to meet the nephew of Muhammad Mukbil Nasir, one Kaid Saleh. The impression at Mawia among the Arabs was to the effect that we had come to arrest Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, and mv obiect was to prove to him that we knew, and were on, our border and did not intend to countenance any further advances on his part. The Turkish Superintendent told me this man’s attitude towards themselves was at present outwardly friendly. My visit was marked by great cordiality, and I feel sure that a hint to Taiz will be sufficient, if hereafter necessary, to secure the deten tion of Muhammad Nasir Mukbil in Turkish territory where he will be power less to practise his pinpricks. The country about Mawia is rich to a degree and the crops magnificent. Mawia village pays $1,500 per annum to the Turks and the people complain of cash payments at frequent and irregular periods. I learnt that therish cultiva tion n°ht up the hill slopes in the entire country-side was necessitated by the importunate demands of the Turkish revenue-collectors. The populace appear ed submissively polite. 7. Captain Saunders will doubtless mention the vast potentialities of a rail road through Musemir by al Malaha and the Wadi Fakir to Ad Dareja. The country is well adapted for the purpose, and except for the portion between Musemir and al Malaha the land is very productive and taps a very rish radius. The strategic value of this line, if in future we wished to push ahead, would be immense. 8. These crops everywhere along the Wadi Tiban, Tubagbain gorge, at Musemir, and in the Haushabi country were superb. Dthala, 31s£ August 1905. (Sd.) H. F. Jacob, Capt., Political Officer, Dthala.

I i lor tisf Memorandum dated the 21st January 1906 by Major H. F. Jacob, Political Officer, Dthala. Although not inclined to suggest help in men to the two Sultans in the recent affair at Nobat Hakim, but favouring, rather, independent action on their part (unless we aided with ammunition), I am not at all sure that the 1839 Bond is couched so explicitly as to preclude at any time our co-operation with Sultan Ahmed Eadthl in repelling attacks of a similar nature. While anxious to avoid any academic discussion on the point I am led to believe that the loose wording of the English (and I have no Arabic counterpart of the Bond to correct me) may be read in support of my contention. At any rate, we cannot afford to depart appreciably in these Bonds from the literal interpretation. The Arab mind is very suspicious, and Sir Ahmed told me he treats all treaties with us as irrevocable and inviolable as if entered into with the Almighty. In the said Bond the words “ Labej or the Abdali ” and “Aden or the British soldiers ” either mean exactly as stated, or they mean an attack likely to endanger on the one part Lahej, i.e ti A1 Hauta, the town rather than the country generally termed Lahej, and on the other our possession of Aden. I do not think we can interpret as without the purview of that Bond any fresh acquisitions of the Abdalis, not his when the Bond was concluded 66 years ago. We have clearly to uphold the integrity of the House of Lahej and to preserve it from dissolution, and this we will gladly do as he is our oldest friend through whose mediation, directly or indirectly, most of the Treaties with other Chiefs have been concluded. I say nothing of the liabilities we took over from him in the way of stipendiary Chiefs when we appeared as Paramount Power in Aden in 1839. Sir Ahmed told me at Lahej three days ago that he was well able, unaided, to dispel any such Subehi attack, and did not press for our co-operation on this particular occasion of the (alleged) attack on Nobat Hakim. He, however, emphasised the idea is most valuable though the Arab’s natural reserve is an initial obstacle not easily to be overcome. Behind the frontier the case assumes another aspect. Here we have no civilised power kept straight by international agreement and fully alive to the mutual benefits derivable from rest and order. Bather are we face to face with more or less fanatics, men with varying idiosyncracies of temper; who are really independent of us and as certainly of one another, revelling in axiomatic that order on the border is meaningless if disorder and chance lie behind, and it is along these post border routes that trade moves and requires con 2011—310 . adhere to our principle of a minimum of interven- encouragement We * mus J b e schooled to work at their own tion in Arab affairs T necessar ii y come from without.

The course indicated to the Political Officer in Dthala is to give the Amir i f TVn&lt;a has been my steady aim. Everywhere in his districts “ins stTnhk company and in countless ways I strive to effect a reconciliation with his tribesmen' The results are with time. No reform can be pressed “ »u unwOUno- pupil. Suggestions are offered, and if finally approved are ron foot ae^allyb/the Amfr. The people learn their ruler’s importance while the reform endures, being neither enforced nor premature. Now along these times of bridging over the existing estrangement between ruler and ruled is the scheme “ I propound oy which the people co-operate to safeconduct trade along the trade routes. It is unadvisable, seeing the Amir’s actual predicament, to say to him, “ You are bv treaty hound to police the route lying in your country. Make, therefore, suitable arrangements, failing which you will suffer the penalty attaching to a breach of engagement, plus the resultant tribal ill-will” Hoc volo sic jubeo. Nothing will be gamed, but we shall see tribal resentment increased an hundred-fold. The Amir unaided, police his roads. He has tried and failed. If it be said that his vastly increased emoluments from Government call for more successful efforts, i would reply that though in theory this is correct, yet surely the battered position to which we have raised, and now left, the Amir has demanded the corresponding enhanced stipend he now receives. He is our creation, and ha 1- measures would defeat our end in view. To adhere to the strict letter ot the bond will mean disaster to the cause we espouse. We shall be obliged here after to give armed assistance, and the harvest will be an increase of dissensions, restlessness, insecurity of route, and, as a resultaut. diminution of trade our arrival, that it, at the very opposite pole to which we are now steering. To cement their friendship it is that I have advocated a stipend, through the Amir’s medium, for Muhammad Saleh, the Kotaibi Chief, and in additii n would secure the co-operation of Kotaibis and others in the patrolling and .safeguarding of the trade-route from Dthala to Nobat Dakim. This oan be best done by an embryonic form of Arab Levies which is administration by the people and for the people, and will be attended with far greater economy than the present scheme offers. Blood-feuds are a cherished heritage, and we have neither time nor the wish to interpose. Where, however, such tribal disturbances bring insecurity to the caravan route, the matter demands our attention and action. The past policy of alternate inaction and vengeance may be relegated to a dead past. ° Vide also ray memoran dum of 7th Septemter 1905 above my No. 43 L of same date.11 The first post we come to in our downward journey is Hardaba (17 miles*). Here we have a blockhouse in the hands of the Amir of Dthala and 20 soldiers. These are a part of the force which by revised Treaty he is bound to maintain. No extra payment is, therefore, requisite. The blockhouse is, however, badly placed being too high up the hill, while caravans passing below would require their guides near at hand. The blockhouse was built to watch the country for miles round at a time when it was thought the Kotaibis were somewhat unsettled. It has served its purpose. A far better position can be had some 800 yards up the Saila (river bed) at the juncture of two -tracks coming from the Hadfan hills. I would propose a small building here after the Arab model. (b) Next comes Suleik (21 miles*) garrisoned by 100 men of the 81st Pioneers. This post cannot at present be safely surrendered to the tribesmen. Eventually, after their internal dissensions are settled, the Kotaibis might hold the place under the Amir. The water is good, and the Port itself is placed at an inlet to the Kotaibi country. It is probable that rest camps in the shape of huts will be always required on the march from Nobat Dakaim to Dthala, and this is the best place for the same. (c) Lower down (at 22j miles*) is the “ Dar al Qabtan,” a fort on the hill of Hamra, and held, since the Kotaibi restlessness, by 30 men of the Alawi Sheikh. The objection taken against the site of the Hardana blockhouse holds good here. The position is too far off the road. Again, and this is the chief objection I have, the fort was built for the ’Alawi ostensibly to protect trade, but actually to repel any Kotaibi attack on that side. Now that the Kotaibis show a conciliatory spirit and we are kept to make them our friends, it is politic the ’Alawi should vacate the post. The following disadvantages may be enumerated in its retention :— (1) Inaccessibility from the trade-route. (It was originally a watch-tower merely.) (2) It is situated on debatable ground, the Kotaibi claiming it as theirs. Muhammad Saleh told me he had strong objections to the ’Alawi holding this hill, but if the latter was permitted to hold it from Government let it any rate be called “ Dar al Qabtan ” (after the late Captain Warneford) and not Al Hamra, its local name. This latter name, he said, would wound the susceptibilities of the Kotaibis. (3) It was created to check the Kotaibis, and has no raison d'etre at this juncture, nay, its retention will preclude that degree of friendliness which I am now striving to maintain between the ’Alawi and the Kotaibi. (4) It is too close to Suleik and is superfluous. Instead of this site I would build in Arab style a Dar or Port for the ’Alawi at a spot clearly within his own territory and nearer Jimil—in fact on a site opposite to his village of Ma’baga and in proximity to his custom house. This is further down the road from Suleik, say, some two miles, and is chosen because of the change of tribal jurisdiction that we shall get here. Prom here there are some five miles to (d) Al Millah (29^ miles*). This is Haushabi territory. The place is somewhat unhealthy, but the water-supply is good. There are here 30 men of the 81st Pioneers. Al Millah is a convenient spot on which to erect a few huts to serve as a rest-camp on the march up, or the ground may be kept clean, merely, and troops may pitch their tents carried with them. Politically no purpose is served by the retention of this place, but two miles lower down we have (e) Bus Habil Ash Shams (31i miles*), i.e., the 4e head ” of the plateau so called. This is Haushabi soil. The Dthambari raiders find it an excellent rendezvous when contemplating a raid on caravans, and here I advocate a mixed post of Haushabi and Dthambari men, say, 26, armed and paid by Government. The Dthambaris are bom raiders. I believe this confidence will not be misplaced. * These distances are from Dthaia.12 (f\ l’ r om this post we travel 10 miles* and then Nobat Dukam, 41 j miles*, is reached. The Sailit Billeh leading to Nobat Dukaim is Haudhabi, though the environments styled Al Hurrikat have lately passed into Ahdali hands. In Haushabi territory and on the banks of the Sailat Billeh I would erect a post of Haushabi soldiers paid and armed by Government and numbering 16 men. Nobat Dukaim is itself the appanage of the Abdali ^ Sultan. We have 60 men of the 81st Pioneers garrisoning the place, and there is a rest-camp for troops. The latter may be kept and huts constructed. The railway’s northern terminus will be here. The Abdali post of 16 mixed Abdali and Subehi garrison, the old post of Dukaim on an eminence over the river liban. These require no stipend from Government. I see no reason to retain Indian Troops here. They do not safeguard caravans. This is not their r61e. ^ They practically hold the rest-camp, as is the case at Al Millah, and Suleik and furnish escorts to officers and others to and from Dthala. There is a Com missariat Zariba here. If the troops are not shortly to work on the road Al'Millah-wards and keep their Head-Quarters here, I would suggest the feasibi lity of abandoning the post. A few Abdali soldiers would guard the huts or the camping ground. The Abdali Sultan is opening bi-weekly markets at this post Several caravan routes meet here, and we already have a native population living in kachha huts. The place will grow rapidly with the railway here, and doubtless Parsee merchants from Aden will set up their shops. Bail way employes will eventually reside here. The Haushabi post to the north of the present camp on the Sailat Billeh is in Haushabi territory will be manned by men, to conduct cravans upwards as far as Has Habil Ash Shams, from where the escort will be changed, and so on up to'Dthala. A part of Arab garrisons along the route will be responsible for the safety of the road and will for this purpose carry out occasional patrols. Their duties are, therefore, two-fold. With regard to the Levies I would suggest a Havaldar should receive Bs. 15 file Bs. 12 each. posts:— 1 At Ma*baja 1 Havaldar and 20 men ... 2 Bas Habil Ash Shams 1 Havaldar and 25 men 3 Post on Sailat Billeh 1 Havaldar and 15 men monthlv pay of the and the rank and men at the various Bs. • 255 • • « 315 • • • 195 Total men 63 ... 765 I give No. 2 more men because the country here is wild, No. 3 has a reduction because the Abdali post is contiguous, I have not included in these numbers the Amiri post at Hardaba of 20 men, nor the Abdali post at Nobat Dukaim of 15 because these latter are paid by their respective rulers. One day Suleikh will be surrendered and men will he required there also. The choice of men will he made by me in consultation with the Chiefs concerned. I have already received many applications and the measure is a most popular one. The Arab likes to hear he is trusted. All will be dismounted. Dress .—At present the only distinctive mark need be a khaki turban. I have not included the’cost of M. H. carbines for each Levyman and 10 rounds of ammunition per carbine as a first issue. I ask for M. H. so as to make a distinction between Government servants and others. This mark also will be much appreciated. In this same connection I would propose to replace the present escort of 20 Aden Troops under a Jamadar by an equal number of Arabs—all picked men. I have nothing against the Aden Troopers who have a distinct r61e in the Hinter- * fbese distances are from Dthala.13 . V land, but believe my work will be render^ noai™. i .

EDGERLEY, K.C.V.O., C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay ; To The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT oe INDIA, Eoreign Department. Sir, I am directed to submit, for the orders of the Government of India, the general question of policy in that portion of the Aden Hinterland which is in the occupation of the Subaihi, the Abdali and Haushabi tribes. 2. Various correspondences have of late been submitted to the Govern ment of India which show that a definite line of policy should be settled for the guidance of the officers of the Residency at Aden. In my letter No. 1511, ' \ dated the 24th February 1908, is submitted the last receipt on the subject of an attack by certain of the Subaihi on the levies of the Sultan of Lahej at the / post of Nobat Dakim. With my letter Nofl340, dated the 15th February 1906, ' papers regarding uneasiness caused by apprehended encroachments of the Turkish Revenue Officials at A1 Doka were laid before the Government of India. The correspondence regarding the murder of the late lamented Captain ^ Warneford at Am Rija has been from time to time submitted with letters leading up to my No. 1620, dated the 27th February 1906. With my letter No;*L506, dated the 23rd February 1908, the latest information as regards the murder of a postal runner near Sheikh Othman on British territory has also been submitted. With my letter No. 1428, dated the 20th February 1908, the latest report containing suggestions by tbe Resident at Aden on the suoject ot the arms traffic from Jibouti is before tbe Government of India. All these questions have now been the subject of personal discussion with the Resident at Aden. 3. I am to refer to the last of these papers at the moment only to draw attention to the fact that should there be a decision to endeavour to patrol the coast with armed dhows and possibly with a small steamer, which is one of the suggestions in the letter of the Resident on that subject, tne Attifi. poit of Rascal-Arrab is the centre indicated for such operations. 4 Dealing with the papers regarding the murder of tbe postal runner, I am to remind the Government of India that while the Boundary Commission were at work in the Haushabi territory several cases of attacks by the Subaihi on our followers near Nobat Dakim occurred, and eventually His Excellency the Governor in Council recommended in my No. 8342, dated the 23rd December 1903, that punitive measures should be taken to punish these attacks on British servants and subjects before the Boundary Commission entered Subaihi country. Sanction to these proposals was given by the Government ot India, but before it was possible to move in the matter the Boundary Commission were on the punt of entering the Subaihi country and it became undesirable for any action to be taken. It appears to His Excellency in Council that in accordance with the principles then relied on, which, as shown in my No. olol, dated the 14th July 1902, are the traditional principles governing our relations with the hinter land tribes, it is not possible to overlook the murder of this postal runner andr - mil mnJt I i ,f 4 : i ! 11 1 i jr ( | » Kr ill,! H: I yU. W i / ! that punishment must follow an incident of the kind. The man was in our service and travelling on our duty. The attack on him was made actually i n Aden limits by tribal raiders. The mail bags in his charge were carried off, their contents rifled, and the attitude of the tribe in their latest reply to the Resident is one of unrepentant indifference and support of the offenders. Judging the incident by the principles which were stated and apparently accepted in the letter of December 1903 above referred to, His Excellency the Governor, in con sultation with the Resident, has come to the conclusion that this incident cannot he passed by and that it is necessary, having regard to the course of this and other recent incidents, to assert a respect for our authority generally in the aroa from Nobat Dakim on the east throughout the Subaihi country to the recently demarcated boundary on the west. If that he admitted, 1 am to pass to the question of how action should be taken. ^ 5. It will be seen from the Resident’s No. 863*, dated the 11 th February 1906, and it is also evident from experience in the case of 0 Submitted with this Gov- Boundary Commission, that it is too late to send “he 23rfPebrX JmG.' terr j‘ 0r y th l S ^S 011 - The ?.° ld Weatller has passed, the climate is very severe, the crops are probably off the ground, the inhabitants of the region are, unless detained by their crops, very nomadic in their habits, and an expedition at the moment would probably be very expensive in every way and possibly ineffective, but at the same time it is undesirable to delay action too long, and I am to submit that it is possible to take immediate action, the effect of which can be maintained during the hot months, wliich will reach the Attifi sub-tribe, and which will at the same time serve our purposes mother respects, e. g., the arms traffic. 6. I am, therefore, to recommend that the first step to be taken should be to send out a force by sea and to occupy Ras-al-Arrah and Turan at as early a date as possible. These places are the principal villages of the Attifi tribe to whom the murderers of the postal runner belong. Notice should then be given to the various sub-tribes of the Subaihi, whose conduct it has been necessary to criticise, that, unless before November next they give satisfaction to the Resident’s demands against them, further action will follow. Ras-al-Arrah and Turan should be held under the civil control of the Assistant Political Resident at Perim, and the occupation should be uti ized to obtain what information is possible as regards the arms trade from Jibouti into that part of the Protectorate. 7. The next question for consideration is as to the action that should follow if the tribes are still unwilling to meet the Resident’s demands. Lliero are two policies possible. The first is one as to which the Government of India up to this time have not made any very certain pronouncement, which the Gov ernment of Bombay would recommend, and which has been stated more than once. I am to refer to this Government letter No. 30-M, dated the Ibth April 1904, which recommended that the most powerful of the Chiefs in the Hinter land, the Sultan of Lahej and the Amir of Dthala, sho dd be utilised to carry out our policy by subsidising them and giving them both moral and material support as might be necessary. I am to point out that this is the policy favoured in paragraph 7 of Mr. Fit z Maurice’s Notes* Govemm^fetter’No 30 -VX^ oi c 190J '&gt; a nd ^ is within the knowledge dated the iSth April 1904. of the Government of Bombay that it is the policy which had the support of Colonel Wahab. So far as the Amiri country and the North-East Frontier are concerned it has been adopted in the appointment of Major Jacob and the instructions which he has received. The matters under discussion in the present letter all arise in the Subaihi country which falls within the sphere of influence, which in pursuance of that policy would be assigned to the Sultan of Lahej, and the policy which the Government of Bombay would recommend in the first instance to the Government of India is to afford to the Sultan of Lahej that “material backing of Government’ the absence of which in the past led, in Mr. FitzMaurice’s opinion, to the lailure of the policy when previously enunciated, as for instance by the Subaihi Treaty of 1881, and on the necessity for which stress was laid in paragraph /4 Iftv 41 rrinpinles as.Maior Jacob is working in that direction in the Amiri territory? ^^o^ndition was .made by Colonel Wahab in his No 23,* ILi ^ dated the 19th March 1904, save that he considered * Submitted With ibis 01ie officer would snASce for the whole border. Its Government No. dated adoption will necessitate the sufficient relief of one the mh April 1904. 0 £ J t p e Assistants from routine work to enable him to tour when necessary among the Subailn tribes. r Ihe adoption of the latter alternative is a remedy of temporary cnaracter and is less likely to lead to future improvement of the tribal relations with either the Sultan of Lahej or the Residency. lam also to notice that in the letter which I am shortly to address to you on the subject of the arms traffic from Jibouti it will be found that His Excellency the Governor in Council, after consu-tajon with the Resident, is of opinion that the first alternative policy above recommended would also subserve, and at a less cost than direct action by the Resident, the interests which it is necessary to guard in that respect. 9 There has been already some delay in the consideration of the action desirable in regard to the murder of the postal runner, and I am to ask very early orders as to the sending of a force to Ras-al-Arrah and luran to hold those places pending a further consideration of the proposals in this letter. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, S. W. EDGERLEY, Chief Secretary to Government.Confidential. No. 1805. Political Department. Bow,bay Castle, 5th March 1906. Prom The Hon’ble Sir STEYNiNG W. EDGERLEY, K.G.Y.O., CJ.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay; To The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT oe INDIA, Eoreign Department. Sir, I am directed to advert to my letter No. 6694, dated the 19th October 1905, on the subject of the arms No. G630, dated the 29th October 1905, with enclosures, traffic in the Gulf of Aden, No. 26o, dated the 14th January 1906, with enclosures. an{ j ^ gy'bjjjit the marginally noted further correspondence from the Resident at Aden dealing with this subject. 1. I am to submit these reports in full because they are referred to in the report, which the Resident has sent to the Secretary of State, in response to direct orders, of which report a copy was sent to you with my No. 1423, dated the 20th February 1906, and because these letters are referred to in other reports from the Resident. It appears to be, therefore, desirable that the Government of India should have them on their records. But the letters of October and January last to some extent cover the same ground and for purposes of a general consideration of the subject might have been a good deal condensed. 2. I am to offer the following remarks on the question after consultation in Bombay between His Excellency the Governor and the Resident at Aden. 3. The present position in the Hinterland is described in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Resident’s letter of October last, and in discussion the Resident has laid great stress upon the fact that practically every adult inhabitant of the Hinterland is already armed with firearms of some kind or other and, as he reports, generally with a French rifle which has come by some route or other from Jibouti or Obokh. The Protectorate is, therefore, in his opinion, full of arms already, and it is clear from the papers, which have from time to time been forwarded, that arms can be purchased in the French possessions without let or hindrance. Furthermore, it is obvious from the Resident’s letter No. 265, dated the 14th January 1906, that, in the absence of very clear orders from Paris, it is futile to expect any assistance from the French authorities at Jibouti and Obokh to stop the traffic. It is rumoured that their recent experience in Yemen has led the Turks to be much more strict in this matter than they previously used to be, but of this there is no certain information. It appears from the interview with Gommandatore Pestalozza, of which a note has been submitted with the Resident’s letter No. 265, dated the 14th January 1906, that the local Italian officers are somewhat lukewarm in adopting the measures which the Resident at Aden and His Majesty’s Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of the Somaliland Protectorate are prepared to adopt, and which they consider cannot succeed without full co-operation by the other signatories of the Brussels’ Convention. 4. So far as the recommendations contained in the first twenty paragraphs of the Resident’s letter No. 265 of the 14th January 1906 are concerned, these are for the consideration of the authorities in London. Any assistance by the con 2014other Powers in the region that may be given will, of course, tend to secure the objects now under consideration, but so far as this Government is concerned it is necessary to consider the situation simply on the basis above stated, viz., that the Aden Protectorate is already full of arms, that the whole adult male popin lation is by custom actually armed and that there is an easy source of supply within reach at Jibouti and that there is no prospect of help from the autho rities of that settlement. 5. I am briefly to refer to paragraphs 10—16 of the Resident’s letter of October last, in which he discusses certain orders he had received from the Bom bay Government in letter No. 2107, dated the 31st March 1905, and in regard to that I am only to say that the paragraphs seem to have been written under a misapprehension and* that as regards the provision of a supply of arms in Aden, the Resident is in accord with the views expressed in the letter of March last and that the Resident’s opinion on the suggestion which was made to him ia paragraph 5 of the letter he discusses w ill be found in paragraph 17 of his letter of October 1905. It is not^now a matter which calls for further discussion. 6. The various suggestions contained in the letters now forwarded are very briefly : — (1) Some general measure.of disarmament; discussed in paragraphs 18 and 20 of the letter of October last ; (2) The possibility of registration of arms and the provision of a source of supply which could compete with Jibouti but be under our own con trol; discussed in paragraphs 12 to 16,19 and 21, of the letter of Octo ber last and paragraph 25 of the letter of January ; (3) The possibility of patrolling more efficiently the coast line of the Pro* . tectorate; discussed in paragraphs 22, 23, 24 and 25 of the letter of October and paragraphs 21 and 21 of tlie letter of January ; (4) The possibility of establishing posts of observation on the littoral both to the west and east of Aden ; referred to in paragraph 27 of the v ’ letter of January ; ^ i r i ^ p' (5) The need and the inefficiency of the Sultan of Lahej’s assistance to us in this matter ; referred to in paragraph 28 of the letter of January. 7. Taking these matters in turn, His Excellency the Governor in Council considers that any idea of the disarmament of the tribes can at once be dismissed as impracticable and as being entirely opposed, even if practicable, to what is known of the wishes of the Secretary of State, for nothing in the shape of dis armament can be carried out w ithout^assuming responsibility for administrative measures in the Hinterland which it is understood is not in any way desired. 8. Turning to the second series of suggestions as to the desirability of placing within the reach of the tribes a supply of arms under our own control in Aden, this has already been placed before the Government of India in my letter No. 1476, dated the 23rd Eebinary 1906. lire question of registration will be dealt with in a letter in which I am to discuss certain amendments proposed in the Arms Regulation. 9. Passing to the question of establishing a more efficient patrol by means of dhows and light-draught steamers, I am to call attention to appendix 1) to the Resident’s letter No. 265 of the 14th January 1906, which gives roughly the estimate of cost so far as ascertained from an inspection of records belonging to the Somaliland Protectorate. As to this, I am to say that no doubt the provision of some such system of patrol would render the direct importation of arms into the Protectorate a matter of greater difficulty than at present and the provision of a light-draught-steam-boat or fast motor-dhows would no doubt subserve many useful purposes between Aden and Perim besides that of dealing with the arms traffic. It would, for instance, facilitate the supervision of the pearl industry discussed in my letter No. 7160, dattd the 6th November 1905, if it is intended to move in that matter. It might he utilized to carry the Government mail between Aden and Perim or Ras-al-Arrah and Perim and thereby dispense with the necessity of paying a subsidy ior the conveyance of that mail, and it is obvious that a light steamerof the kind oa the coast might not infrequently bo of service to the Resident “\ sc ° n * u&lt; ?. u9 . W ° rk - ' But . th0 . e , 08t of establishing and maintaining an efficient patrol is by no means inconsiderable, and I am to point out that there is no doubt that the flank of any such arrangements could easily be turned Arms are already landed in some quantities southward of Mokha, at Kadduha and probably at Debad as pointed out in the papers received with Foreign Department No 46-E.B. of the 5th January 1900.- A glance at the map will show bow little difference it would make to the trade which is said to go on if arms were landed here and then passed into the Protectorate by land. Any proposal to efficiently guard the land frontier of our Protectorate is, of course entirely out of the question. Therefore the establishment of a patrol to the west ot Aden is a measure which can only be very partially successful, and the expenditure which it would involve is, therefore, relatively considerable His Excellency the Governor in Council is farther of opinion, as will be seen below, that a considerably less expenditure than the money which, 1 steamer and 3 dhows would cost (probably not less than Its. 75,000 per annum, with an initial expenditure of not less than two lakhs), if used in another direction, would produce at least equal results. 10. As regards the further suggestion of the establishment of posts on shore, I am to invite attention to my hio. 1801, dated the 5th March 1906, in which it has been suggested in connection with certain offences by the sub-tribes of the Subaihi that a post should be established at Ras-al-Arrak, at any rate temporarily, on other grounds. That might be maintained for such time as the Government of India may see fit and possibly permanently with a view to secure the internal order of the Protectorate. So long as it is maintained it will, no doubt, be the most convenient centre for any system of patrol which it may be decided to try. It is further suggested in the Resident’s letters that posts might be established on the littoral to the east of Aden. His Excellency the Governor in Council dots not at present recommend that course. It is alleged that all the tribes, not excluding the Sultan of Lahej himself, are quite willing to engage in this trade, that the profits are considerable and that the arms are run across from ports on the littoral on the west of Aden to ports on the east and thence shipped to the Italian Protectorate in Somaliland, and thus evade our port regulations at Aden and such watch as we are at present able to keep on the proceedings of boats which trade with Jibouti. The evidence in favour of this scheme of trade is not very strong, but it is no doubt probable that arms like other goods are passed from our eastern ports to Somaliland. If, however, an effective patrol or other means can be taken to the west of Aden to stop the trade at that point, it would seem to be unnecessary, even in the interests of the Somaliland Protectorate, to attempt to control, the eastern ports, and it is certainly unnecessary to do so in the interests of the Aden Hinterland itself. 11. I am, therefore, to pass on to the last matter of suggestion which His Excellency the Governor in Council has to consider. At present it seems to be clear that the tribes have at least the reputation of being quite willing to engage in what is to them a profitable business, not even excluding the Sultan of Laliej. It is also certain that the leading characteristic of the Sultan is a love of money, and that he has done little in our interest, except words, since receipt of the orders of the Government of India in their No. 516-ft. A., dated the 7th March 1902. One possible policy is to endeavour to convert the Sultan from that attitude, so far as it exists, into one of whole-hearted co-operation with us in this matter. In my letter No. 1801, dated the 5th March 1906,1 have been instructed to place before the Government of India proposals that the policy of working through the Sultan should be consistently and fully utilized for the control of the Subaihi tribes. I am now to suggest that if that policy be sufficiently liberally and consistently adopted to secure his active co-operation with us in the suppression of the importation of arms from Jibouti into the Protectorate, it would probably be the most effectual measure that could be taken for that purpose, and though it no doubt means liberal recurring expenditure on the Sultan, yet I am to submit that tnis policy would almost certainly not cost so much as the suggested arrangements for patrolling the coast, for an establishment of outposts, and other repressive and disciplinary measures4 which in default of some such policy, the Residency must from time to time “ Tins sueffestion has been previously placed in a few words before undertake. This suggestion n dated the 22nd May 1902 _ As ^nte^uUn my ”0 1804, dated the 5th March 1900, that policy would also LS rve otier objects, and it appears to His Excellency the Governor in Council, on a survey of the conditions of the Hinterland, to he the mast suitable and economical policy for our various needs to recommend to the Government of India. 12. I am, therefore, to suggest— (1) That as recommended in my letter No. 1476, dated the 23rd February IQOfi a full and sufficient supply of arms for the actual needs of the tribes which will compete in price and popularity with the French weapons should he made available under tbe orders of the Resident at Aden ; (2) that snch moral and material support should be given to the Sultan of Label as will enable him and render hinn willing to control various small sub-tribes which are at present subject to no control in practice, and to also make bis territories an efficient barrier to the trade m arms from Jibouti. 13. Failing tbe above recommendation it is, of course, possible to try some of tbe repressive measures above indicated or, again, there is still one other alternative, if it is open to us under the Brussels Convention, and t at is, that having regard to the attitude of the French and Italian Governments and to that of the Turkish Government in normal times vyhen not engaged in putting down its rebels, and having regard to the fact that the Aden Hinter land is practically already full of arms, and again to the fact that the weapon which we should supply from Aden would be greatly superior to the LeGras rifle, which the tribesmen now obtain from Jihouti, the present unequal and apparently useless struggle against this trade should be abandoned.

LETTER to His Majesty's SecreU of State for India, dated the March 1906, No* Z+f-* .[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] Printed for the use of the Foreign Office. March 1906. CONFIDENTIAL. (8614.) Memorandum respecting the Aden Frontier Delimitation. WHEN in 18/3 the Turks, who had evacuated the Yemen in 1633, reoecupied that province, t he re were nine tribes in the Hinterland of Aden with whom Her Majesty’s Government had direct relations, and whom they considered to be more oi less under their protection. These tribes are the Abdali, the ladhli, the Akrabi, and the Subaihi, which are the nearest to Aden; the Haushabi, the Alawi, the Amiri the subjects of the Amir of Dthali), the Yaffai, and the Aulaki. These two last-named tribes are each divided into two sections, the Upper and Lower Yaffai and the Upper and Lower Aulaki. The Turkish Government have contended that the Sultan s sovereignty extended over these tribes in virtue of the former occupation of Yemen. We, on the other hand, have always maintained that they were independent. In addition to the Turkish claim of sovereignty, there have, ever since 1873, been constant dis putes also in regard to the frontiers between these tribes and the territory' under the direct administration of the Turkish authorities. Both subjects have from time to time given rise to discussions, sometimes of an acute nature, with the Porte. In 1873 it was proposed that the nine tribes above named should be taken under British protection. The proposal was not sanctioned; but while the question was under consideration at home, the Ptesident at Aden had, under instructions from India, sent a British force to support the Chief of Lahej (in the territory of the Abdali tribe) against the Turks, who were giving military assistance to a rebel against the Chief. The Turkish Government endeavoured to make a bargain that, as they had disclaimed [ 249 ] Bany intention to interfere, the British force should he withdrawn from Lahej. This was declined, and it was not until the Turkish troops had evacuated Lahej that the British force returned to Aden. The right of the Porte to request the withdrawal of the British troops was at the same time expressly denied by the Secretary of State for India, “ since the relations of the British Government with the tribes round Aden are independent of Tuike\ r , whom we do not admit to have any locus standi in that region.” In the same year (1873) Her Majesty s Am bassador at Constantinople informed the Porte that Her Majesty’s Government would not tole rate the interference of the Ottoman authorities in the territory of the nine tribes, and this declaration has been repeated several times since. The intrigues and interference of the Turkish officials nevertheless continued in the following vears, and in 1885 culminated in a more decided forward movement, resulting in the occupation of Jalela, in the heart of the Amiri country, and several other villages belonging to the Amir of Dthali. Her Majesty’s Government protested against this occupation, though Jalela was not men tioned, hut the Turks wmre in strong force at the time, and nothing more was said than that Her Majesty’s Government could not acquiesce in the indefinite occupation of the Amir’s villages. In the autumn of 1885 the whole subject of our relations with the Aden tribes was discussed, and certain proposals were made which were referred to the Government of India. These proposals were to the effect that, of the nine tribes, the four nearest to Aden (the Abdali, Subaihi, Akrabi, and Padhli; should be placed under British protection by Agreements con cluded with the Chiefs; that Agreements should he concluded with the Haushabi and Alawi and with the Lower Yall'ai, binding them not to sell their territories, or accept the domination of any other Power; that the Upper Yafifai and the Aulaki should he left independent; and that as regards the remaining tribe—the Amiri—we should quietly desist from our present attitude of opposition to the Turks, allovviug the absorp tion by them of the hamlets on the uplands, and possibly pensioning off the Amir and his imme diate successors.Secret despatch, August 6, 1886. Secret despatch to India, December 9, 1887. Foreign Office to India Office, November 19, 1887. 3 The Government of India in 1886 expressed themselves in favour of these proposals, but recommended that Treaties should also be entered into with the tribes occupying the coast eastwards between Aden and the limits of Muscat, so as to exclude all chance of foreign interference on the seaboard. Owing to negotiations on other matters proceeding at Constantinople, no action was taken till the end of 1887, when the Government of India were authorized to proceed with Pro tectorate Treaties with the Akrabi, one of the nine tribes, and with the Wahidi and Mahri, two tribes on the coast to the east of the Aulaki and outside the nine tribes. As regards the substitu tion of a Protectorate form of Treaty for one binding the Chiefs not to sell their territories or accept the interference of any other Power, Lord Salisbury expressed the opinion that “ the responsibility incurred by the British Govern ment in either case is much the same, while a Treaty of Protectorate gives a more complete control and is more efficient to counteract inter ference by foreign Powers than the less definite Agreement previously suggested.” In 1890 Protectorate Treaties were ratified with the Fadhli, Akrabi, Lower Aulaki, and certain Atifi and Bashemi sections of the Subaihi, and also with the principal Chiefs along the coast, east of the Aulaki, as far as the Muscat frontier; in 1895, with the Haushabi, Alawi, and Lower Yaffai ; in 1903 and 1904, in consequence of the difficulties experienced by our Com missioners during the work of delimitation with Sultan Khatan of the Upper Yaffai, and with three sections 0 of that tribe, with two Sheikhs representing the Upper Aulaki,f and with the Chief of Behan-el-Kasab ; and in 1905 (after the completion of the delimitation) with the Amiri As regards the Abdali, the fact that the terri tories of the Sultan were already under British protection was recognized in an Agreement of 1882. In 1900 a Turkish subject erected a fort at Ad Dareja, in the Haushabi territory. Diplo matic representations proved unavailing, and a force had to be sent from Aden in July 1901 to expel the intruders, who were assisted in their resistance by Ottoman troops. Further en croachments in Amiri territory were reported, * Dthali, Mausatta, and Muflabai. f Yeshbum and Nikb.and in October 1901 the Government of India suggested a delimitation of the frontier, an independent proposal to the same effect beinj? made almost at the same time bj the Ottoman Government. The proposal was accepted, and the Commis sioners met at Dthali, the chief village of the Amiri, in February 1902. The British Com missioner was Colonel TV ahab, B.B., of the Survey Department of the Government of India. He was familiar with the country, having carried out surveys in 1891-92 as far north as Dthali. It transpired, however, that the Turks had utilized the interval before the Commissioners met to occupy with regular troops and artillery a number of points in Amiri territory which had hitherto been in the possession of the Sheikh, among others Jalela, which they had previously occupied in 1885. They also established irregular Arab levies over a great part of the Amiri terri tory, terrorising the natives and making them believe that Turkish rule was to be established. Inflammatory religious appeals against the British were also circulated. The Turkish troops and levies had orders to prevent any British party from moving about for purposes of survey or inquiry, and persons attached to the Commission were actually fired on. The British escort at this time consisted of only 150 men, while the Turks had, apart from levies, over 800 regulars and eight guns on the Dthali plateau in the immediate neighbourhood of the British camp. His Majesty’s Government protested against these encroachments without result, and eventu ally, to ease the situation, it was proposed in June that the delimitation of the Amiri country should be postponed, and that the delimitation of the country of the Yaffai (another of the nine tribes), lying to the north-east of the Amiri, should be proceeded with. This led to no result, as though the Turkish Government professed to accept the proposal, the Commissioners on the spot received instructions not to recognize the Yaffai as one of the nine tribes. A complete deadlock ensued, the Turkish Government being unable or un willing to control their local authorities. In these circumstances it was decided, on the recommendation of Sir N. O’Conor, that Mr. Fitzmaurice, second dragoman of the Embassy at Constantinople, should be appointedf)@) to the Demarcation Commission as Joint Com missioner. He was acquainted with the attitude of the Turkish Government at Constantinople, and it was anticipated that his command of the Turkish language and experience of Turkish officials and methods of business would render him a valuable colleague to Colonel Wahah. He ioined the Commission at Dthali at the end of November. In December 1902, His Majesty’s Govern ment reluctantly decided that it was necessary to send up troops to support the Commission at Dthali and to reinforce the Aden garrison from India. Four hundred men and four guns were accordingly sent early in January 1903 to Dthali, and reinforcements were sent from India to Aden. In order to prevent the arrival of Turkish reinforcements at Hodeida, His Majesty’s ships “ Hermione ” and “ Intrepid” w r ere sent to Aden from the Mediterranean. By May the force on the Dthali plateau and on the com munications had been increased to about 1,500. These proceedings had a good result. Orders were sent from Constantinople in February which caused the local authorities to modify their attitude, but it was not till towards the end of March 1903 that the levies were finally dis banded, and the Turkish forces withdrawn behind the line which His Majesty’s Govern ment had claimed provisionally for the Chief of Dthali, leaving Jalela in his possession. With this withdrawal of the Turkish troops the preliminary difficulties disappeared, and delimi tation, in the proper sense of the wmrd, may be said to have begun—thirteen months after the meeting of the Commissions. Though organized obstruction ceased with the withdrawal from Jalela, it was some time before the excitement created in the tribal country ceased, and progress was at first slow. However, in May 1903 it was possible to with draw the ships. In June a proper survey of the Amiri border was completed, and the British pro posals as to the general line to be followed by the demarcation were referred to Constantinople. In September and October the Shaibi country up to the Wadi Bana was surveyed by the Joint Com missioners, and a line agreed to and demarcated. In October the actual demarcation of the Amiri country was begun by the Joint Commissioners, the doubtful points as they arose being settled [249] ° Cwhich the Ottoman Government claimed as part of their district of Rada, but they were con sidered hy His Majesty’s Government, on satis factory evidence, to he connected with the Yaffai, and thus to fall within the British Protectorate. On the 23rd September Sir N. O’Conor reported that, at a farewell audience before he left Constanticople, the Sultan “opened the conversation hy assuring me that he would give his formal consent to the Aden frontier delimita tion next day.” This undertaking, however, was not observed. On the 25th October Lord Lansdowne found it necessary to instruct Mr. Townley to inform the Porte that His Majesty’s Goverument proposed to send a ship of war to the coast to watch over British interests, and the Admiralty gave orders to the Commander-in-chief on the East Indies Station to send a ship. On the 28th October Mr. Townley reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs begged that the dispatch of the ship might he delayed, and promised an answer hy the 3rd November. On the 4th November Mr. Townley telegraphed that the Sultan’s reply had been handed to him in the shape of a telegram to the Turkish Ambas sador for communication to Lord Lansdowne, hut that, having regard to the terms, he had refused to act on it. On the same day the Turkish Ambassador presented the reply to Lord Lansdowne. It spoke of the line proposed for the Subaihi border as a “ marked encroachment,” claimed Dabiani, Nawa, Tuban, and Rubeaten as “belonging incontestably to the Kaza of Rada,” and begged for a reopening of the question. Lord Lansdowne replied by reciting the Sultan’s promise of the 23rd September and the failure to give effect to it. He said it was “outrageous that at the last moment an attempt should be made to reopen the question; ” and that the arrangements for sending a ship of war to the coast, which had been suspended at the Ambas sador’s special request, would certainly now be carried out. The “ Proserpine ” arrived in the Red Sea on the 6th November. On the 30th December Mr. Townley reported that an Irade had been issued instructing the Turkish Commissioners to draw the boundary outside Bab-el-Mandeb to Kudam (the Vilayet8 of the Yemen retaining Turba and the wells, as also the territory bounded by a line terminating at Sheikh Mirad). The wording of this Irad6 betrayed complete ignorance of the question, and also stated that neither Government was to be allowed to send troops into the Nine Cantons. No mention was made of the delimitation of the boundary north-east to the desert, but a promise was given that no portion of the territory would be ceded to a third Power. His Majesty’s Government decided that the stipulation as to the dispatch of troops to the Nine Cantons was inadmissible, and Mr. Townley was instructed to press for compliance with the original demands, including the recognition of the north-eastern frontier. (To Mr. Townley No. 3, Telegraphic, of the 9th January, 1905.) The Turkish Ambassador was also informed that, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, the Porte were acting in a most unreasonable manner. (To Mr. Townley, No. 27, of the 18th January.) On the 7th February Mr. Townley was instructed to inform the Porte that His Majesty’s Government took note of the new Irade, and of the Porte's intention not to send troops into the Nine Cantons, but that His Majesty’s Govern ment would reserve to themselves their indis putable right to send British troops there when and wherever they pleased. On this under standing His Majesty’s Government were ready to demarcate the line from Mudariba to Sheikh Murad, but should fresh difficulties be raised by the Porte, His Majesty’s Government would be obliged to decline all further negotiations, and would take their own measures for defining the line they considered it necessary to claim, and for maintaining their rights over territory included in it. (To Mr. Townley, No. 41.) At Sir N. O’Conor’s suggestion, His Majesty’s Government later consented to drop all reference to the dispatch of troops into the Nine Cantons. His Majesty’s ship “ Perseus ” was ordered to Turba, in order to give her moral support to His Majesty’s Government’s efforts to arrive at a settlement, and on the 14th March Sir N. O’Conor was informed by the Porte that instructions had been sent to the authorities of the Yemen for the delimitation of the frontier of the Subaihi from Mudariba to Sheikh Murad, as also for the prosecution of the delimitation of the frontierI 9 between the Yaffai and the Yemen, from the Bana Biver north-east to the desert. On the 21st April Sir 1ST. O’Conor reported the signature of the proces-verbal, and Mr. Mtz- maurice was congratulated on the successful issue of the negotiations. The proces-verbal, after reciting the boundary as far as the Wadi Bana, defined on the signed maps, states, as regards the frontier beyond the Wadi Bana, that it was generally in a line north east from Lakmet-es-Shah to the desert; that the whole of the Aulaki and all districts of the Yaffai (including Unbeaten, Nawa, and Dabiani) lying to the south and east of the line to the desert belong to the nine tribes. It is silent as to Behar, with which we have a Treaty and which we regard as Aulaki; and also as to Beda, with which the Resident at Aden was authorized to conclude a Treaty, which, however, has not yet been executed. Beda is apparently neither Aulaki nor Yaffai, but is reported to lie south of the line north-east to the desert. In order to place officially on record the settlement which had been arrived at, Sir 'N. O’Conor proposed (despatch No. 396 a of the 10th June) an exchange of notes, to which were to be attached copies of the maps showing the frontier as finally traced by the Joint Com mission, and of the proces-verbal exchanged at Sheikh Sa'id between the two Commissioners. This proposal was approved, and Sir N. O’Conor was instructed to insert in the British note a paragraph to the effect that the actual demarca tion of the frontier north-east from Bana was to be postponed to a more favourable moment. (To Sir N. O’Conor, No. 225, of the 11th July.) A map of the frontier delimitation is annexed.10 i i , j \ Supplement. On the 8th March, 1906, the following despatch was addressed to His Majesty s Am bassador :— “(No. 96.) “Foreign OJice, “March 8 , 190t5. “ I HAVE received and considered, in communication with the Secretary of State for India, your Excellency’s despatch No. 81 of the 7th ultimo, in which you explain that difficulties might be raised by the Sultan in granting a fresh trade for the official record of the result of the Aden delimitation, and suggesting that it might be sufficient if Mr. Fitzmaurice were to com pare the maps at His Majesty’s Embassy with those in the possession of the Ottoman Minister for W ar. “I gather that your Excellency is of opinion that tire establishment of the identity of the two sets of maps in this manner would constitute a sufficient record of the frontier delimitation, and, in these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government- think it unnecessary that you should press for a more formal ratification of the Arrangement. “ I am, &amp;c.
