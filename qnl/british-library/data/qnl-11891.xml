N.-W. The road i 27 leads over a plain^ salt and sandy towards the sea, but grassy towards the hills, to Shaikh Abdulla (Stage 7, Route 63, Vol. Ill, Part 1 ) at about 8 miles. At 6 miles cross a ravine filled with salt water. Then for 10 miles over a barren marshy plain. The remainder is over a plain gradually rising towards the south, and sloping to the foot of the hills. This part is said to be good grazing land with numerous flocks of sheep and goats. The river HindSn is crossed just before reaching the town. In the Foreign Be-Route No. 1— could. partment Gazetteer, 1905, it is said that the river is unfordable at Hindian town, the breadth in February being 80 yards. It can be forded 9 miles above the town; Hindian town is mostly in ruins ; population numbers about 1,000. Cultiva tion is mostly confined to the river-bed. Route No. 3 connects here. Water. —Bell says that the water from the river was hardly drinkable in February, being tainted in passing through the hills south of Zaidan. In September it was reported sweet and clear. Supplies.—Some probably available. 2 BANDAR MA’SHUR 25.—General direction ——— N.-W. First 3 miles 52 over a plain with grass which, however, ceases in the next 3 miles. Beyond that the plain falls and is again covered with grass. The last 6 miles are over a plain of dark-brown alluvial deposit with very little grass. In spring rain water is abundant here, but in summer there is very little, and that quite brackish, in wells. Route No. 7 connects here. The next stages are by Burton. 3 SARAIMEH 15.—Leaving Bandar Ma’- —-— shur in a N.-W. direc- * 67 tion the road traverses a barren plain. At 2 miles ground full of ravines is crossed. This would be deep after rain. It draws to the west of Ma’shur to the creek. From this point patches of wheat become com mon. Frequent camps occur and grass and scrub increase as the Jarrahl is approached. At 13 miles the road touches the river and turns down its left bank. Passing the village of Khwaja reach Saraimeh situated on both banks of the river at 15 miles. Road passable to all arms. Fuel and forage and large flocks of sheep as the river is approached. Patches of wheat almost throughout. No water between Bandar Ma’ shur and the river. 4 JANJIREH 15.—Follow the left bank •—■— of the Jarrahl N.-W. 82 for miles the road then turns to the west, the river pursuing a winding course in the same direction, the road touching it at 6 J and 9 f miles. Irrigation canals, into which the water is raised,a Route No. 1— conld. -commence at the 8 th mile. At 12 miles a canal 15 feet 'wide crosses the road i it would have to be ramped, and the mouth, 2 miles to the north, could be blocked. A level plain is crossed and Janjireh reached at 15 miles. Road passable throughout to all arms. Janjireh is a large village or group of settlements with some date-groves, but otherwise standing in open country. . Water. —Plentiful. PW.—From scrub. Supplies. —Available. 5 FALLAHlEH 13.—At Janjireh the Jar- (S. W. edge) rahi river is dis- gg : „ . persed into canals, its principal streams being directed to Umm-ul-Sakha, Buzleh and Fallahieh ; from these main canals a network of minor channels spreads in every direction over the palm-groves and open fields. The canal running south from Buzleh alone reaches the sea, one small channel joining the Karun above Muhammareh. At Janjireh therefore it is necessary to take boats, of which, with sufficient notice and the co-operation of the Shaikhs of Buzich and Fallahieh, large numbers could be collected. From Jan jireh to Fallahieh the diminished channel of the Jarrahi is followed for some 6 miles in a south-westerly direction :_here the river practically disappears and a canal is entered, Fallahieh being reached at 9 miles. To control the canal system of Falla- hieh°it would be necessary to hold Janjireh, as from there any part of the country can be flooded, or deprived of water, by directing the stream up the Jarrahi into the desired canals. From that point laden animals could by pursuing winding path s to Bu zieh and Fallahieh, and skirting the marshes west of that place to the south, reach the Karun river. 6 KARUN RIVER ? 30.—Continuing down the canal, which dimi- 125 nishes as the water is drawn off into the palm groves to either hand, the south-west edge of the palms is reached at some 13 miles from Janjireh; the canal here becomes a mere ditch, 8 feet wide with 1 J to 2 feet of water, and the desert is entered. The canal is descended in a south-westerly direction for some 15 miles ; for some miles extensive marches lie to either hand; they then gradually merge140 ; dh &gt;-Y -| r vi.,j T t r H , Route No. 1- in a grassy desert, which would be largely flooded after rain. The canal to this point is not more than 6 to 8 feet wide ; it then gradually turns to the west. As the Karun is approached marks of the rise and fall of the tide are seen and it broadens and deepens. The Karun is reached at about 30 miles from the south-west border of the Fallahieh groves, at Sulaimamek about 15 miles above the Muhammareh. 7 MUHAMMAREH 15.—For details,', mde Gazet- teer of Persia, Volume III.

HA /iPA r' 1 CHAM SI AH 17.—General direction W. — The road leaves Beh- 17 behan in a north westerly direction and runs down the centre of the Behbehan valley and parallel to the Marun river for a distance of 6 miles. Just before reaching Charasiab, 4 miles, the river changes direction due west and crosses the traveller’s front. The river is actually touched first at Lasapid (8 miles, no supplies except a few sheep), from which point the road traverses the left bank due west. The track leaves the bank of the stream from t;me to time and meanders through the belt of low hills and broken ground, which separates the Zaidan and Behbehan plains. At 17 miles the wide reach of Cham Siah forms a convenient camp. There is a hamlet consisting of a few brushwood huts near the ford, the inhabitants being Agha Jari Lurs. In the dry season the river can be easily forded in many places, but7 Route No. 3 — contd. after rain would be generally impassable except at well- fords which would remain good owing to the hard pebbly bottom. Water.—Qood, from river. o .*Li au m i i r GARGARI iitm . jii t * 2 \ S fl f. IJ ; z/jazirf 15.—General direc fcioit S.-W. The Marun river is left imme diately as it takes a sharp turn north-west at Cham Siah, while the Gargari track follows a south-westerly course, winding for 10 miles through the same belt of hills mentioned already, as dividing the Behbehan and Zaidan valleys. The track, although in many places leading over rocky ground, presents no real difficulty to mule transport in fine weather, and is pass able by infantry and cavalry, but not by artillery. At 10 miles the road descends sharply to the Hindian valley, which has here widened out to about 12 miles. The village of Gargari lies due south from the point of debouchment and is reached by a track passing over alluvial pasture land. The river Hindian flows due west, 2 J miles south of Gargari, and its bed here is about 1 mile broad. 3 I) EH MULL A 22.—General direction VU — — by S. Leaving Gar- 54 QoM. gari (which includes 2 villages, viz., Upper and Lower Gargari both lying some dis tance away from the river), the best way for a caravan is to avoid the river-bed and to keep to the usual general west direc tion at a distance of about 1 mile from the right bank of the river. At 5 miles the traveller is confronted by a plateau which at first sight is like an island, but on closer acquiantance proves to be the general level of the Jarrahi plain standing out against the lower level of the river bed, which at this point takes an elliptical course south wards, passing the village of Ghuleh on the left bank, before resuming its original west course to Suvaireh, where its direction alters finally to the southward. The caravan track keeps along a chord of the ellipse, as it were, c Suvaireh and thence again follows the general course of the river to Deh Mulla, which is reached at 22 miles. Here there are some. 3,00.0 inhabitants. Near the- town the river is about 50 yards broad and flows between steep banks ; in the autumn it appears to be fordable anywhere, the bottom being of firm9 Route No. ^—eontd. *•.' • '?Z‘ « N .* f JL ,’JL r [ :J east of Bebbehan. About miles from the latter place cross the river Martin which is fordable at this spot, leaving on right a little up the stream, the village of Kazim and on the left the village of Hurestan, Kurdistan, and Husainabad. 2 BABA AHMAD 24.—General direction M. -W. Reach an old gji square building in the form of a Musalman imdmzddeh. Gross a low range ^ of cal careous hills, and reach the village of Charu. Continuing in a north-north-westerly direction, reach Tashan (9 miles). Here There is a spring of very clear water where sacred fish are kept. Move north-west having to right stupendous mountains, bear ing from south-east to north-west and a range of hills of less attitude, in a parallel line, on the left. The road soon becomes very rugged, and the country around dreary and entirely devoid of vegetation. Cross the dry beds of several mountain streams, and arrive at the entrance of Tang-i-Sarvak after a tedious march. Enter the narrow defile, hemmed in between lofty rocks, which overhang the way. A mountani stream below. By a steep ascent, among loose stones, at times upon an old pavement, the polished stones of which are so slippery that horses can with difficulty advance. The path soon widens, and reaches a grove of oaks, cypresses, and a tree peculiar to the southern parts of Persia, called the kandr. There is said to exist a communication between this spot and Isfahan , and, though the road is very steep and rugged, still, to judge by the slippery worn-out pavement above alluded to, it formerly must have been much frequented. Emerge from the defiles of Tang-i-Sarvak. The road lies through an uneven country. At first skirt the mountain of Nauzar, and proceed, after haying rounded it, over uneven ground, much resembling that which is passed over in previous stage consisting chiefly of gypsum hillocks entirely destitute of habitations, but offering here and there patches of green turf and brushwood, especially along the vaffey of a mountain stream which is crossed. Baba Ahmad has some clear springs, and is surrounded by high reeds and grass. 3 SARILEH 32J.—General direction N.-W. The road now qq winds over a hilly country in a north-westerly direction. Soon cross the riverRotiTE No. 4— mntd. Mughar, coming from Tang-i-Mughar, and soon after another river. Both are greatly chocked up with bushes. Cross another mountain streani. An ascent, and then a steep descent —the country much broken into hill and dale. The village of Bui Faris discernible to north-north-east. Cross the river of Bui Faris. Turn to N. N.W., and pass by the remains of some stone walls. Cross two rivulets—the second a stream of some size, but both overgrown with high reeds Ascend a hill and along a high tableland with traces of cultivated ground and former habitations. Cross a stream covered with reeds, the country still hilly and the mountains of Nauzar discernible to the south-east. Up a very steep and craggy ascent winding among high mountains, which command it on the right and left. From the summit of the mountains along which road goes, take the direction of the villages of Patak and Dalun lying to the north on the plain below. Here the hills o i right slope gra dually into the plain, leaving the Mangasht mountains behind them' covered with snow. Reach the plain of Patak and the village of new Patak, leaving the ruins of the old one behind. Cross the river or Allar of Ab-i-Talh, a considerable stream running from east to west between high banks. The village of Dalun with An Imdmzddeh is left on the right.

Ford the clear waters of the Tazang, a broad • and noble stream, with a hard gravelly bottom. A fortified Janaki village stands on its right bank, and another surrounded by gardens on its left. Ascend a steep hill by a circuitous path, and enter a hilly country. The road first leads to the north, then turns to the east, the general bearing being by compass north-east. Come to an arched gateway called Rahdar-Dar- vazeh-i-Gach. From Rahdar-Darvazeh-i-Gach the fort of Mangasht lies due east. Over high and uneven country of the Shara-Gach-i-Barvazeh, begin the steep descent into the plain, leaving Mangasht to the south-east, the road leading duo north. Cross the river Tala, coming from the valley of Man- ganun on the south-south-east, and reach the ruins oi11 Route No. 4— contd. Cross the Ab-i-Zard. Ascend a hill, and come down on the plain of Kaleh-i-Tul. For rest of route see stage 6 of Route No. 15. NTote.—T here are two tracks connecting this route with the country to the east. (a) Manganun to Kaleh A’la (route 8) vid Hapurd. 16 miles. A track con necting Kuhgalu and Bahmai territory with the Bakhtiari Garmsir. NTot in general use, owing to the hostility which has long existed between these tribes^ The road, is difficult in places, and is of little importance. Water .—-Plentiful at all times. Supplies .^—Plentiful in the Manganun valley, as far as the rule of the Bakh tiari extends, but in Bahmai territory scarce. Leaving the village of Manganun strike south-east into low gach hills which occupy the broad valley between Kuh-i-Mangasht and Kilh-i-Saulak (or Sarvak). At 1 mile pass Tamurad, 1 mile north of road. At 2 miles Ab Gandu J mile south of road. At 3 miles a road diverges east to Lakum and Kaleh Mangasht; see below. Continue south-east. At 6 miles descend into ravine. At 9 miles, pass through district of Barm-i-Sih. A fine spring here issues from the rock. At 10 miles pass through district of Pusht-i-Parr. At 11 miles through district of Wajil. From 10 miles onwards the inhabitants are no longer sedentary but nomadic. At 16 miles reach Kaleh A’ala, a “ strong place ” of the Bahmai, recently rebuilt. Supplies scanty and fuel plentiful. (b) Manganun to Kaleh Mangasht via Lakum, 24 miles. A cross route of no importance except to parties wishing to exploit the supplies of grain and fodder of the district. General direction south-east. Leaving Manganun, strike west into low gach hills which fill the valley and at 3 miles strike off from Kaleh A’ala route (a).. At 4^ miles village of Gunbad, J mile north of road. At 5 miles Chigasurak 1 mile to east. At 6 miles Shamsabad inhabited by Saivids. At 7 miles village of Saulak, 2 miles to east on side of hills. At 10 miles reach Lakum. Supplies limited; fodder and grain obtainable,. Continue west passing at 10 miles a deep gorge in hills to north, through which a track for foot passengers only was reported to lead to the yailaq district of Sablistan ; at 11| miles enter district of Wajil inhabited by Bahmai, Bakhtiari subjects for the most part. The country is here covered with fine balut trees many of considerable size and of great age. At 14 miles descend into ravine, crossing which arrive at the foot of Kaleh Mangasht (a notable local fortress) ; no inhabitants ; the hill is considered as the property of the Bahmai, in whose hands it has long remained. A spring of water on the top of the hill, a little grazing, and some ruins. It can be ascended only on foot by two tracks. (Wil son, 1908.) Route No. 5.

Supplies .—For 200 men and 500 animal?. 2 PATIK 12.—General direction S.-S.-E. Cross the 241 Ab-i-A’la immediate ly on leaving the village and over low hills, entering at 2 miles on to Sarileh plain, the village of that name, with the fort of Kaleh-i-Bagh-i-Naranji dominating it. {See Route 4).13 Route No. 5— contd. This fort is a recent erection. It should not be confused with Kaleh-i- Antai\ an ancient ruin, said to contain a deep well, which stands on a ridge between Sarileh and Patlk. The road passes at 3 miles a large spring, Barm-i-Jamal, whose waters flow into the Ab-i-A’la. Continuing over the plain, which is extensively cultivated, at 8 miles pass Dalun \ mile to east on north bank of Putang river which is crossed at 8 ^ miles, ford able except for a few hours after heavy rain. The track now enters the Patik plain, marshy in places, but largely cultivated, and reach the Bagdili division of Patik at 11 J miles, and the Patik division at 12 miles. Water .—Always plentiful in streams. Supplies .—Por 200 men and transport. 3 BUL-FABIS 9 .—General direction S. —-—- (Bu’lfabis) by E. Leaving 331 Patik, strike over Patik plain ; road is easy and flat. At 2f miles leave plain and ascend over low gach hills which bound the plain to the south as well as to the west. At 3 miles reach summit and watershed, whence Kaleh Nadir (a prominent sugar loaf peak) and Sarileh are simultaneously seen. Continue south by east over stony hills ; road steep and stony. At 5| miles road descends steeply to ndld filled with high reeds known as Darreh Nali. Water all the year round, tents as a rule in summer. Cross ndld by a difficult track through high reeds and ascend low hills again. At 6f miles cross 2 nd ndld, also full of high reed'. At 9 miles reach Ab-i-Bul-Faris, along which settlements of Bahmai, and, in winter, of Turk, are scattered for 2 miles up and 2 miles down stream amidst extensive irrigation ; 1 J mile up stream is the Imamzadeh Jamal-ud-Din Husain on left bank. Extensive ruins are to be seen, but no permanent dwellings : 50 families in summer, 250 in winter. Bui-Fans is in the hands of a Turk tribe who purchased the land not long ago, but taxes are collected by the Bahmai chief. There are also about 40 families of Saiyids who remain here all the year round, and are reported to be connected with, and to pay taxes to the Taib! Kuhgalu. Water —River.

A track also runs along right bank of stream through a narrow gorge passed at 2 miles north-east of Shikaft-i-Talleh, some natural caves, reached at 4 miles and near by some ruins of no interest called Saiyidun. See Route 4 (stage 3). irn i 7 l Bid-Fans to Stdtdndbdd. Xote.—T his is a cross route of little importance connecting Bul-Fans with Ha muz and Sultanabad. The latter 21£ miles from BCd-Farls. Obstacles .—The Ab-i-Bul-Paris as far as Pijan runs swiftly between banks overgrown with reed 15 to 18 feet high and almost impenetrable. The river is fordable, but always with difficulty, and only here and there, as the bed is deep though the volume of water may not be large. There is an alternative route Mamatain. General direction west-south-west. Leaving Bul-Farls strike along west bank of river for 1 J miles, passing through rice fields. At 1 | miles, cross Ab-i-Bul-Paris at the confluence of two ndlds. Cross again twice shortly after, reaching ruins of village, built of stone, on left bank at 2-| miles. The track now keeps to left bank till Pijan is reached. At 4 miles enter Tang-i-Dugacheh ; track steep and difficult. At 5 miles leave Tang. At 10 miles reach Pijan. Ten acres irrigated land ; 30 families Kuhgalu Bahmai Saiyids from Imamzadeh-i-Mir-Salar, east of Dishmuk. The land is under the same Government as Bul-Faris and also belongs to Turks. This place might conve niently be made a halting place. Supplies very scanty ♦ barley at ruinous rates ; fuel plentiful ; —grazing good always. Continuing west-south-west, and leaving Pijan, cross river and pass over low steep hills. At 12J miles descend steep slopes to dry ndld. At 14J miles touch Ab-i-Bul-Faris again, and cross it, recrossing it at 15-| miles. At 17 miles reach top of hill whence Sultanabad and plain are first visible.

The first mile of the road from Ma’shur is swampy in winter and almost impassable after rain; it then becomes sandy and somewhat firmer, but is said to be very deep in wet weather. At the point where ships discharge cargo is a firm patch of sand ; the creek here turns south-south-west towards the anchorage at the junction of the Khur Dauracj. At this point the width of water at ordinary low tide is 15 feet and depth about 3 feet, the banks are of shelving mud and the water at high tide some 50 feet wide : to facilitate landing from boats or baggalas a pier of 20 yards would be necessary, so as to reach the middle of the patch of firm sand. The road from there to Ma’shur would in wet weather require to be built with brush wood faggots, etc., which could be procured from the_ Jarrahi river : the stream crossed at one mile south of Ma’shur would have to be traversed by a made causeway of 15 yards in length. Apparently there is no nearer approach than the point above described to the anchorage near the mouth of Khur Dauraq. Animals cannot approach the sea in that direction, while a man can go on foot with difficulty; along the creek towards the sea, soil is of a kavir description and renders the going very heavy after rain. Between Bandur Ma’shur and Ramuz (stage 3 ) the road is largely used by caravans which appear to ply mostly during the summer and autumn after the wheat and rice have been harvested. There does not appear to be much traffic on this section at other times of the year. The teat from June to September inclusive v ould make military opera tions almost impracticable, but for the rest of the year, pro vided the difficulties of landing at Bandar Ma’shur could be negotiated, this route would be far the most suitab.e for an advance to the Bakhtiari mountains. The road iu this section is practicable for all arms ; requires cutting and widening for wheels in stage 3 at 35 miles. Either bank of the Jarrahi river can be followed. The fords at Khalafabad (stage 2) are practicable for laden animals for the greater part of the year, except after heavy rain.

Epitome.—Th&lt;d main road to Dishmuk and the Kuhgalu country from Ramuz and Shushtar. Little used in 1908 as the Bahmai subjects of the Bakhtiari Khans, were hostile to the Bahmai subjects of 5 Ali Murad Khan of Kaleh-i-Dishmuk, and not under the control even of their own chief. Unless both sides of the Tang-i-ChavIl were held a small force could anni hilate an army which was marching up the Tang. Passable all the year round, though near Dishmuk 2 feet of snow is often encountered from December to March. As far as Mamatain it is easy, but this village once past, the road becomes difficult, passing through 2 gorges, and crossing and recrossing constantly the Putang river, a difficult track, impassable for two or three days after heavy rain. The road is only fit for mules. The road is difficult in places in the Tang-i-Chavil, and heavily laden mules will give trouble, and horses could scarcely proceed in places. After Tang-i-Chavil the road is steep, but offers no special difficulties.

The Tang gradually deepens, and eventually at 7 miles attains a depth of about 1,500 feet. (Another track passable in dry weather keeps to river bed all the way.) At 8 miles, the track, descends to river level to a pasture with a few acres of cultivated land. At this point Tang-i-Shibr joins the Tang-i-Chavil from the north. Tang-i-Shibr contains sulphur deposits which are regularly exploited for local use, and to some extent for exporta tion. At 8 | miles a ravine coming from south joins the main Tang. Continue along right bed at bottom of Tang, which gradually narrows to about 550 yards, at the same time dimi nishing in height. The track which follows the river is com pletely dominated by the cliffs above. At 13 miles the Tang turns north through an impassable cleft in Kuh-i-Dilli known as, Tang-i-Rusmeh. {See alternative stages.) The district of Rusmeh is now entered; no supplies; nO’ permanent huts, only tents. The track continues at the foot of Kuh-i-Dilli amongst steep wooded foot-hills.

Authorities. —Baird, 1906 ; annotated by McDouall, 1907.; Epitome .—The route merely consists of a track across open uncultivated ground, passing, as a rule, within a mile or so of the left bank of the Karun. The use of this track is chiefly confined to messengers moving between Muhammareh and Ah- waz these generally follow this route between Ahwaz and the Marid stream crossing the Karun by ferry at the point. There is little caravan traffic on this route, as most of the traffic be tween Muhammareh and Ahwaz is carried by boat. After rains the whole of the country passed over becomes sodden and heavy, making the going difficult, and, it is said, sometimes imprac ticable. The soil on both banks of the river is the same, but the ground on the left bank is said to be more liable to inunda tion than the other. Certain parts of the ground passed over are impregnated with salt, and these are said to be worse than the remainder after rain. The route in dry weather would be suitable for transport of any description : after rain wheeled transport would find difficulty, and could probably not count on doing more than31 Route No. 12— could * 8 to 10 miles per day. After rain, transport of all kinds, and men, horses, would find it difficult to do more than short marches. The only physical obstacle is the passage of the Marid, some 12 miles above Muhammareh. When the water is low (i.e., between May and October) this stream is fordable, though the bottom is always muddy. After the rains have begun (i.e., any time between November and March) this river is often un- fordable, and must be then crossed by a ferry, the animals being [swum over. The best place for the erection of a bridge or for the passage by ferry, is within a couple of yards of where it takes off from the Karun ; further down the stream gradually develops into a marsh, and a secondary obstacle in the shape of a Fallahleh canal would have to be crossed. The width of the Marid channel averages about 40 feet at the point where the crossing recommenced. If troops were to be sent from Muhammareh to Ahwaz by the left bank of the Karun, it would be preferable that they should be camped north of the Marid channel. Water .—Water is obtainable from the Karun river only and conveyed direct to this point by boats from the transports which would have to be left at Muhammareh. Fuel.—Fuel is obtainable from brushwood which grows along the bank of the river, but the supply is rapidly diminish ing.

The country traversed is open, uncultivated ground offering very good graz ing in dry weather ; in rain it is probably very heavy. At 7 miles the Marid has to be crossed. When the river is high this is a broad and difficult obstacle, and passable only by ferry : in dry weather it is fordable, the best point of passage being within 200 yards of the Karun. There is an ■ d native boat at the village of Marid available as a ferry ; it can take over ten passengers at a time, but horses have to swim over. Vehicles, cannot pass. The width of the channel is 40 feet, but the amount filled with water may be less or more, according to the season of the year. In the beginning of November 1906 it was fordable, the water mounting as far as a pony’s shoulder. ,t ; ' H 25 ’ALI-BIN-HUSAIN 15.—Three solitary palnr trees standing on the banks of the Karun mark the spot known as ’AlI-bin-Husain, which is the usual halting place.

This route would be impracticable unless the troops could complete the march of 32 miles, away from the river im one stage, as there is no water anywhere en route.

The road is easy no longer level; passable by all arms except artillery and wheeled transport; to the north and east the country is undulating. No track yet. Cross the plain, a swamp in rain. At 4 miles cross a tributary of the Gupal river by a bridge ; the stream meanders slowly between mud banks 18 feet to 20 feet high. The water is brack ish but drinkable. It has a taste of naphtha and is the same brackish water that is found in the marsh which is fed by it. On the banks of the stream are the summer grounds of the “Bowie ” (Bavi ?) tribes. There are signs of cultivation. The river shows marks of flood 6 feet higher than its normal level. It was 30 feet broad and 6 feet deep when crossed (April 1910). McGowan describes it as 40 yards wide and very deep and rapid in February. Hopkins found it 20 yards broad and 2J deep in April. After rain it is usually impassable. About 1 mile to the left is the Arab village of Rashid, 50 mud huts and a mill with six grindstones. Track now commences and runs through about 4 miles of wheat land.

The river has a very strong current and in April 1903 was 70 yards wide and 3 feet deep, running in a bed of shingle and boulders f mile wide. The water which comes from the snows was chalky in colour but very good. Fording the river is difficult ; unloaded donkeys were carried away. This river emerges from the hills about 5 miles north-east of Ramuz and flows in a southerly direction across the plain. No other river debouches from the hills near Ramuz. Thence across a well cultivated and irrigated plain in a southerly direc tion. At 15 miles pass through low hills. Pass villages of Basaidi, 10 mud houses ; Pikin, 5 mud houses ; and Palim, 5 mud houses. Cross a dry shingle ndld bed, 200 yards wide, with pools of water standing in it. The ndld runs in a southerly direction. Then over 3 miles of grassy plain and enter well irrigated and cultivated country.

The route is at present a fair mule track and could be im proved into a good camel road without great difficulty. It. Route No. 15— can be used throughout the year. In winter it is closed to camels by snow and occasionally for short periods altogether. Latterly (1913) it has been closed to caravans from June to September by Kuhgelu raids over the Kuh Mangasht. The route was cleared of boulders and the necessary bridges constructed by Messrs. Lynch Brothers in 1903, under arrange ments with the Bakhtiari Khans. The latter have an agreement with Messrs. Lynch Brothers in regard to the upkeep; but in 1913, little had been done beyond the building of six blockhouses and some desultory .repairs to caravanserais. It has been an ancient highway of considerable importance and traces of former paving occur from time to time in the mountainous section. For further details of its construction and the present arrangements, under which it is maintained, see the article under the heading Bakhtiari in the Gazetteer, Yol. III. See also the description of this road in the Military Report on South-West Persia, Yol. IY. In comparing this route to Isfahan with the route via Shiraz, the latter is considered in every way more suitable for the move ment of any considerable body of troops, for the following reasons On the Lynch Road, camping grounds at several successive stages would suffice for only 300 animals ; supplies are scanty for several successive stages; the gradients are excessively trying; if any of the three bridges along the road were held, they would be difficult to force. It is best to consider the road in four sections or phases :— '• - —'' ■ • ' ; •■iit ■ Miles. (1) The plain section, Ahwaz to Salmieh . . 40 ( 2 ) The low hills section, Salmieh to Malamir . 69 (3) The mountainous section, Malamir to Kharaji . 104 (4) The upland section, Kharaji to Isfahan . . 68 Section ( 1 ) presents no difficulties for wheeled transport, except in wet weather. Runs across flat, barren desert plain. Section (2) could be improved at great expense and delay into a road fit for wheeled traffic. It is at present a fair mule track. It is difficult in places, but never impassable, except for a few hours after rain. Does not rise above 3,000 feet.Route No. 15 — contd . Section (3) is wholly unsuited for wheeled traffic, and parts of it are not practically possible of adaptation. As a camel and mule track it varies greatly according to the temporary state of upkeep. It cannot be described as good or easy, especially for large parties of animals. Section (4) could be rendered feasible. It is at present a good camel and mule track and guns could probably be got along it with difficulty. It is practicable for mules, horses and camels throughout, but no camels are taken over the road after the first rains as the steep slippery slopes of mud make progress impossible for them. Physical obstacles ,—No repairs could fit the track for wheels. Many of the gradients are very trying and would require repair if in regular use by large bodies of troops. Local labour bad and difficult to obtain. Should opposition take the form of destroying any of the three main bridges along the route, it would be difficult for troops to force a passage. The main physical obstacles are :— ( 1 ) The descent from the Gardan-i-Sarrak (Stage 8 ) to the Pul-i-Shalu, the earlier portion of which is very trying owing to the old paving, which is now worn smooth and slippery. The actual descent to the Pul-i-Shalu is very steep but , capable of improvement. (2) The descent from the Gardan-i-Marvari (Stage 10) to the Pul-i-Amarat which, in summer, is the worst portion of the route. The north face of Kuh Marvari is very precipitous with continual cliffs and slabs of sheet rock. The path follows the only break in these cliffs where a gap of some 800 yards of earth and stone enables the road to zig-zag down at a very steep gradient. Any improvement, without con siderable blasting would be difficult. ( 3 ) Snow also lies on the Laghamgir pass (Stage 11 ) for short periods; but causes no serious difficulty to caravans. ( 4 ) Snow often lies on the Northern slopes of the Barrah Murdeh pass (Stage 12); but the gradients are quite easy and no difficulty would be experienced in clear-43 Route No. 15— contd. * * \ ^ s. • ¥ x .’1 f I 1 F / I ing a track from Gadumkkar to the head of the pass /A '1 \ “I'!*! miles^ whio/h would toon fTio rmon for some depth with snow from December to March. If caravans are numerous they make a hard beaten path over the snow, even if three or four feet deep, and then little difficulty is experienced. &gt; Snow does not lie for more than ten days in the upland snow in whiter there is an alternative road from Du Pulan (Stage 12) to Ardal 8 miles and thence the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash to Kharaji (Stage 14), 20 miles, the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash is a narrow precipitous gorge, the track only 2 feet wide in places. Mo improvement of this defile is practicable. (b) Both the Zirreh and the Darkash Warkash passes may be entirely avoided by a track which diverges at Siligun about 2 J miles north of Naghun and runs via Chighakhur, Urujan, Tang-i-Duzdan and Khulinjan. A madroad connects feihgun with Ardal. This route is some 24 miles longer than via, the caravan route but can easily be covered in one extra sage while the highest point in d ang-i-Duzdan is more than one thousand feet „ At Present the track between Khulinjan and Bagh Abrisham is encroached on by cultivation, the exit to the Chighakhur vailey is closed by a rocky spur, and the road continuing to Budalji is not driveable. This road could, however, be easily adapted to wheeled traffic throughout. (c) A slightly more circuitous route is followed by the Khans when driving from Isfahan to Chighakhur : valleys. Alternative Stages — (a) Owing to the Zirreh pass being frequently blocked by lower than the Zirreh pass and the approaches are much less would require improvement for military use, vide Route 16. D, Route No. 15 — contd. Climate. —The route is practicable for troops all the year round; but the cold and snow from December to March and the heat, especially in the lower stages from June to August would prove very trying. Local and Indian country-bred horses do not suffer severely from the heat or cold. The rain of the year is received chiefly in January and March. (a) Transport. —Any force requiring over 500 mules should bring its own transport with it. Mules in large numbers are not easy to get at Ahwaz at any time. Messrs. Lynch Brothers could state appi'oximately the amount of transport available at any particular moment. Shoeing, but only with Persian shoes, can be done at Ahwaz, Ramuz and Malamir. (b) For the lower stages some 6,000 camels might be collected from Koweit though the estimate is optimistic. Including Dizful, Shustar and the numbers working on the Lynch road from 1,000 to 1,500 mules might be collected under favourable circumstances. Owing to the present insecurity of the routes the numbers available have much diminished in recent «*Ff iv-ff'Qr if ) 11 prim fvfr ft ft If ffTAfi / in fiJ'T Off ^OifXH JifOui* years. (c) Donkey caravans ply between Ahwaz and Isfahan and a few hundreds of these might be employed, with their own Charvandars, in supplementing supply convoys for troops. They would not prove suitable transport to accompany troops on the march. The llliats require all their own transport for at least two months in the spring and for two months in the autumn. The animals at the end of each move are unfit for immediate employ- i i T &gt; J LW u iJKwv/ t/IJ J ^ i J Ml J $5 V i JI / r M i i.\J i T ^Ci ment. Both donkeys and bullocks would prove very unsatisfactory transport for military purposes even if available. The idea of supplementing transport from the llliats is not very practicable and the question of collection too problematical for reliance to be placed on the figures. Camping grounds, —-Between Pul-i-Shalu (Stage 8 ) and Du Pulan (Stage 12) inclusive the recognized camping grounds are congested; but space sufficient for a Brigade could be found at all of these, by camping in the neighbouring cultivation except at Shalil (Stage 10) when camp would have to be made 4 miles along next stage. a45 Route No. 15 — contd. Accommodation.—-^evais, are available at Wais (Stage 1 ) Malamir (Stage 7) and every stage onwards. They are generally too filthy and out of repair for use by an European and tents are necessary. The Malamir serai would shelter 50 men and 50 animals and the Qaleh, J mile distant, a like number. Shamsabad (Stage 15) 50 men and animals, Qehfarukh (Stage 15) 100 ditto, Labid (3 villages) (Stage 16), Madraseh (Stage 16), Bistagan (Stage 17), and Pul-i-Vargun (Stage 17), 200 each, Bagh Vahsh 100 (Stage 17). Water .—At Wais excellent from the Karun. At Salmieh (Stage 2 ) from wells which it would be necessary to dig beforehand for troops except in winter, when the water lies in pools from December to March.

The road then ascends a spur between two ravines. The ascent is short but steep, and the summit, known as the Gardan-i-Alwanieh, 810 feet, is the point at which the road passes under the protection of the Bakhtiari chiefs. The descent is easy. Several torrent beds are crossed which are always dry excepting immediately after rain. From the bottom of the descent, where a small brackish stream called the Rudkhaneh-i-Gazm has to be crossed, the road runs over an ■ . • ■ . - undulating plain for 6 f miles. This locality is known as Gazin and at this point a Qashqai settlement (Hamsayas of the Bakht iari) will be found from December to March ; later on in the year it moves to mile 8 |. The road now lies in a dip between low hills emerging at mile 8 on to a nearly level bit of ground followed to 8 J miles which is the summer encampment of the qashqais. It is located at the head of a brackish stream. There is a spring of fresh water near by to the south-east. There are oil springs in the vicinity, grain and fodder for 500 animals can be obtained in season. The road now follows a dry torrent bed between hills of broken rock and earth. At 9J miles the first considerable ascent commences up a spur from the head of the torrent valley over hills of broken disinte grated rock. The ascent is accomplished by zig-zags and in volves a climb of 800 feet along a rough road which has been cut into the spur. To the north the country is open, undulat ing and covered with grass. The road then winds through gypsum hills to mile 10 and then ascends by a winding track, cut in a spur, and easy for transport to the summit of the Gardan-i-Jaru (FSOO 7 ) at mile 11 .

The ascent up to the gardan is stony but gradual up a series of zigzags which are most numerous in the lower portion and entails a 40 minutes’ climb (G. S. 13J). The road in early times has been paved up to the summit (4,050') with large eobble stones which are still firmly cemented in. From the summit at mile 7 the road gradually drops to 4,000 into a small torrent bed which crosses the road at right angles and falls into the valley of the Kuh-i-Ishgil through a rocky ravine, thenQe through an undulating plain of cultivated ground to mile 10J. A guard tower has been built at the summit to protect cara - vans against Kuhgalu raiders. At 10J miles the descent of the Gardan-i-Sultam commences in a direction east-north-east. Angle of descent easy (G. S. 6°). The foot is reached at 3,200' after 45 minutes. The road surface of the Rah-i-Sultani is paved with large cobble stones, which in course of time have got polished like marble and are very slip pery. About half way down the descent another torrent is crossed, but neither this nor the one at the foot of the Gardan-i- Sarrak has sufficient drainage to ever prove an obstacle From the foot of the descent the road runs east-north-east through the valley of a stream lying between high hills. The bed of the stream is crossed several times and contains but little water in dry season, though there is a trickle and water in pools at the end of the dry season. At 13 miles a spring of good water known as Chashmeh-i-Khatun is passed. The supply disappears into the ground about a mile further on. The road now turns south-east for the remainder of the stage. At about mile 14^ the route runs for a distance of some 60 yards or so along the perpendicular face of the hills on the north side of the valley and elsewhere along the edge of a steep and almost vertical drop to the stream 30 or 40 feet below. The path to Qaleh Madraseh is narrow and. except at the end lies along the north side of the ndld. The ruins of Qaleh Madraseh, mentioned as a rest-house by the Arab Historian Ibn Baua in his travels, is reached at mile 16. The ndld is here joined by another from the east—the Tang-i-Kaf.

At 19 miles the highest point the Gardan-i-Gatchi is reached 3,500'at the head of the valley and the descent to the Karun commences. The descent is very trying at angles varying from 7° to 18° and the track moves partly down the bed of a narrow ravine and partly along its edge. The ravine is crossed two-thirds of the way down. Further on a small plateau overlooking the Karun river is passed, the descent being continuous and thence a steep descent to the bridge is made. This final descent to the bridge is very steep and cut in solid rock, winding and difficult. The bridge is placed very low down so as to reduce the span to a minimum. The bridge is an iron suspension bridge of 43 feet span erected in 1903 by Messrs. Lynch Brothers. At the bridge the Karun flows between perpendicular cliffs and the span of the bridge gives the unalterable breadth of the river at this point. In early spring the current runs at 13 feet per second but it is liable to rises of several feet in a few hours. From tho bridge a steep ascent leads to a wide plateau on the right bank of the river. This ascent is not so steep as that on the Malamir side and is cut in gravelly soil. There is a serai in bad repair on a small and inconvenient platform half w r ay up to the plateau and a new serai half finished in 1913 on the plateau itself. Before the bridge was built the river used to be crossed by a ford and ferry at Gudar-i-Balutak about 4 miles up stream. From there the road proceeded south of the present one through the hills until it reached Qaleh Madrasseh via the Tang-i-Kaf. The best camping ground is found 1J miles to the east of the bridge on the river bank. Between Gardan-i-Sarrak and Gardan-i-Gatchi the scenery is magnificent. oT fmtrG wen A Water.— river.

It rises again to the summit of the Gardan-i-Gil (sometimes known as the Gardan-i-Rikat) by a similar road. The summit 2,830 is reached at 3J miles, and a descent similar to that on the northern face is made. The G. S. of these ascents and descents is 8°. From here on the ground is fairly open with cultivation and the oak forest and the road is good throughout and traverses the lower slopes of the Kuh-i-Safid, north of the Ab-i-Rikat.

The lower half of the descent is bad, lying over ground which presents constant patches of sloping sheet rock affordincr a slippery foothold. At the foot of the descent (5,300') at mill 5 a narrow tongue separating two valleys, both of which fall to the Bazuft river, is crossed and a steep ascent follows. At 5,600' the road rises in 20 minutes’ climb to the Gardan-i-Ruar 6,300' and drops again slightly along spurs and valleys of the Kuh-i-Marvarid to a ruin at 8 miles. Shortly after this the Gardan-i-Marvarid is reached with a guard tower guarding the pass. The descent from the Gardan-i-Marvarfd constitutes the greatest difficulty on the whole road. The northern face of the Kuh-i-Marvarid overlooking the Bazuft river is very precipitous with constant cliffs and verv steeply set slabs of sheer rock.

Caravan time 7 f hours. the caravanserai the route follows the valley of the Shalil stream, crossed in the last stage, running along the slopes of the hills on the left bank of the stream. The path, which is made for the first If miles, is cut in a slope of soft earth, which is constantly slipping and being washed away. The path is consequently so narrow that caravans coming in opposite directions have great difficulty in passing each other in many places. Parts of the track are very difficult in wet weather owing to mud. For the last quarter of a mile the road runs over nearly level ground, just above the stream. It then makes an ascent of 1,100' in rather more than two miles. There are several intermediate ascents and descents. At 2-| miles the route, hitherto running in an almost easterly direction, turns sharp to the north, leaving the main valley, and ascends a steep narrow side valley (G. S. 13k down which flows the Shalxl stream. The waters are used at a bend in the route for driving two flour mills. At the mills a small left bank tributary is crossed which would probably never cause trouble. A path 5 feet to 6 feet wide has been cut in the steep hill side on the east of the valley. At 4 miles the road reaches an elevated plateau (o,100') and' runs for a few hundred yards along rice fields. A good camping • ground for a brigade could be found near this spot. There is a steep ascent to a small gar dan where there is a guard tower (5,400') at 4J miles. From here the road passes through undulat ing and thickly wooded country along the lower slopes of the Kuh-i-Gurrah gradually rising to a height of 6,500' at mile 7 1 whence the road turns south-east up a narrow valley between two stony spurs, the entrance to which is through a rocky cleft about 50 yards in length. ^ 11 SARKHUN * • 13.—General direction for the first 8 miles E. and after that X.

From here the road descends 2,000' {G. S. 13°) in a south-easterly direction. The descent is steep in places but the surface is good. At first for about J a mile the path descends one valley, then winds round a spur and crosses a side valley ascending a spur with zig-zags in places. The road gradually turns north, north-east and the Gul Shur 5,000 stream is crossed at 10J miles. After crossing the stream, which is fordable at all times without difficulty, an ascent of a few feet is made on the far side to reach the higher ground on the right bank of the Sarkhun stream or Ab-i-Hilisat, which is then followed until it is crossed at the end of the stage. Here it issues in the form of a spring in a cavity in the cliff on the left or west side of the road. The quantity of water varies with the season, but a few yards below the head spring there is always a copious flow. A wooden bridge of about 12 foot span has been provided here. To reach Sarkhun caravan serai on the left bank of the stream a torrent bed has to be crossed. This is often dry but a considerable amount of snow water comes down at times.

About 1J miles up it crosses to the right bank and tlien enters the Tang-i-Sarkhun, a narrrow gorge with, perpendi cular cliffs about J of a mile long, the slope of which is 4°. In the course of this gorge the road takes to the bed of the water course in which it continues after the gorge has opened out into a narrow valley. A short distance up the valley the road turns back at less than a right angle and ascends the flanking hill on the left or west. It skirts round the end of this hill known as the Gul-Rukruk. The ascent becomes steeper, 6J°, and rises to the summit 6,600 which is reached at 3 miles. It then resumes the direction of Du Pul an skirting the Tang-i-Hazar Jarib for T| miles to the mouth of the Tang-i-Gandum Kar. During a portion of this distance it runs along the edge of high perpendicular cliffs which form the eastern side of the Tang-i- Hazar Jarib. The descent is gentle at first (6°) to 6,506 at 5 miles with a direction north-west. At 5 miles the descent becomes steep, 23°, and continues north-east to 5| miles to the mouth of the Tang-i-Gandum Kar, where this Tang joins that of the Hazar Jarib. The lower part of the Tang-i-Gandum -f -r- _ ' .’ -*■ • Cv Kar is a narrow gorge between perpendicular cliffs. A few hundred yards up on the eastern side there is a cave facing north in which about 20 people couM find shelter. A small stream of perennial water runs through the Tang-h Gandum. Kar and thence down the Tang-i-Hazar Jarib emerging close above the Sarkhun Serai in the form of the torrent bed men- tioned in the last stage. The track crosses from the left bank to the right bank of this stream, which just above here has one of its sources in a considerable spring, after leaving the defile at 6 miles. From Gandum Kar, 4 9 £0Q', at the mouth of,the defile the track rises to the lowest point of the semi-circle of hills which heads the valley and basin. Up to here the ascent has been gentle and the going good. It now becomes steep (G. S. 8°) and stony and finally ascends in rivetted zigzags up a steep hill face of loose stones and earth. The crest, known as the Gardan-i-Gandum Kar, 8,100, is reached at 71 miles after a, final climb of 500 feet. There is a good camping ground at Gandum Kar but no supplies except fuel and water. From here the road leads north down into the Gaud-i-Barreh Murdeh or the Barreli Murdeh depression 8,250 / which for two months in winter is practically closed by snow. The basin is 1| miles wide and a J. jj jj. j~ U 1 .ti l - ilfiv 1 E60 Route No. 15— short zigzag ascent leads to the highest point on the stage, the Oardan-i-Barreh Murdeh (8,350') which is 2,700' above Sarkhun. The depression can be crossed with the help of good mules and by tramping down the snow sufficiently to bear the weight of laden animals ; but it is dangerous to attempt it in bad weather. From the north crest 9 miles the road turns north-west and descends by zigzags, general slope (G. S. 9°) to Sardab spring 7 800 at 11 miles. Level ground and water is Scarce. Here the direction changes N. E. slanting to the left down the moun tain side, which slopes to the Karun river. Including Sardab seven valleys and ravines are crossed on the way. The route then ascends towards the further side of the valley and crossing the ridge descends by a long and stony descent, the Chift-i- Maiburun. Betweeen this and the next ravine the track is cut round a spur into limestone rock, known as the Arsun-i- Bulangi, which is steep and rough. At this point, 6,000, mile 14, the road again changes 1ST. N. E. The remainning ravines have steep ascents and descents. At mile 18| the tipper plateau of the Karim is reached, whence there is a fall of over 200 feet to the Brick Bridge, known as Pul-i-Malik, crossing the river. Span 12 yds. 11 feet roadway, 150 feet above the water, The bridge is high in the middle. The immediate descent to and ascent from the bridge are difficult, being cut steeply in bed rock. The caravanserai has been built on the left bank of the river, which here flows through cliffs, and is 100 feet above the bridge. A track to Muri branches off to the west near the serai. This is a hard march either way. Oak wooding throughout the march except from Gardan-i-Gandum Rar to Sardab between which points there is scrab. The stage is exposed to raids from the upper Tang-i-Hazar Jarib. Du Bulan has 100 houses, 1,000 sheep and goats, 50 cattle, a few donkeys and horses, 3 mules. Yearly produce 6,000 mans of wheat and barley, 1,000 mans of rice. * mi ' 1 Camping ground .—The best camping grounds are on the left bank of the Karun on either side of the junction with the Ab-i-Sabzch Kuh, and ground on the left bank of the Ab-i- Sabzch Kuh, between that river and the village of Du Bulan, when these are not under cultivation. 11 ^ y* 1&lt; 1‘ ) Fuel. —-Plentiful; water plentiful.

The route then descends to cross the Ab-i-Sabzeh Kuh, a large tributary of the Karun which it joins about 150 yards below the bridge. The descent is very steep in parts and soft soil which becomes heavy after rain, j; i IM!, H A The present bridge over the Ab-i-Sabzeh Kuh is a rickety structure of hurdle work made of brushwood supported on trees ; but a bridge with brick piers is being built (1913). In dry weather the Sabzeh Kuh stream can be forded near its juncture with the Karun. At this point the alternative route via Ardal to Kharaji diverges along the right bank of the Sabzeh Kuh. ' .-h,. i : on • .rr- - The route leads out of Du Pulan village east by south and up the Kuh-i-Bazgiran until it strikes a made path known as the Rah-i-Gil-i-Safid which it follows to the left of the pass in a northerly direction (G. S. 11°). The upper part of the ascent is rivetted in zigzags and the summit, 6,800, is reached at 3f miles. The road then descends rather steeply for about J mile and then crosses a plateau overlooking the Ab-i~Sabzeh Kuh. At 6| miles the edge of the plateau is reached and the road leads westward descending (G. S. 12°) to the Ab-i-Sabzeh Kuh 5,400 which is crossed at 7f miles, being a drop of some 700 feet in the last mile. - ■ In the descent three narrow ravines from the plateau above are crossed and final drop is down a similar ravine. The river is crossed by a ford, but when necessary by a bridge f of a mile up stream made of timber on two stone piers. The ascent from the river is very steep in places and is in soft soil. Just after crossing the village of Darreh Gall ah Gah is passed mile to the south. Ascending from the river the route runs very broken ground cut up by ravines and culti vated to a considerable extent. The path is a mere track G. S. 10°. At 10 miles it reaches the plain (G.

Afr/f The route then descends by three zigzags G. S. 12 ° to the Siligun stream 7,790 which is forded at H miles. This stream never contains a large body of water and its waters are tapped at 3 miles by a watercourse which runs along the hill on the left bank over the gardan just crossed and back into Naghan for which it is the main water supply. After crossing the Silegun the road follows up its right bank, running a few feet above it by a bad and stony bit of road to Sidagum 7,900. The valley of the stream is here very narrow and a path has been cut in the sides at many places. At 2 | miles a track diverges nearly due east to Chighakhur about 9 miles distant. . Ar &gt;&gt;.: mSi :| i Here the valley opens out into a Highland glen and the road becomes a mere track over undulating ground, gradually ascending to 5 .j miles, where the main ascent of the Kuh-i- Zirreh is commenced. The ascent is by zigzags, many of which are very short, (G.. S. 11 °). The ground is rocky and steep, and the climb is a stiff one. From the point where the zigzags commence to the head of the? pass at 6-5 miles the ascent is 300' in a distance of 1,300 vards.. The outer edges of the path are in places rivetted with stone work.

From the bottom of the main descent a further descent of about 250 feet in | of a mile leads to the village of Shalamzar at 10J miles. Half a mile short of Shalamzar a deepish but narrow irrigation cut is crossed by a stone and earth culvert in good repair, roadway .10' (1913). Bridging material is available at Shalamzar. Just before Shalamzar a small stream, the Ab-i-Shalamzar, is crossed by a wooden bridge of two spans about 12 feet each and roadway 10 feet wide.

Camping grounds exist at this and the other villages en route to Isfahan, if an alteration in the length of stages is desired. Rente 16, a carriage road to Ispahan connects here. Beyond Shalamzar the road crosses the valley bottom and rises by a short but steep ascent (21°) to the summit, 6,850, of the Gardan-i-Shalamzar a neck in a low ridge of conglome rate hills north of the village. From the summit 11J miles, the descent is less steep, 12J°, and at the foot, 6,650 at 11| miles the Tashniz-Chighakhur road is crossed. At 12} miles the road turns north-east and from this point the villages of Tashniz and Sartashniz are visible 2 miles to the west. Just before reaching the bridge over the Ab-i-Jahan-bm, the road branches in various directions, S. E. to Gishnagan, S. S. W. to Shalamzar and W. to Junagan. The bridge is of masonry, in good repair, and can be crossed by carriages. The Khans have made a carriage road from Shalamzar f of a mile to the wmst of the caravan route and from there it is possible to drive to Junagan, Shalamzar, Gishnagan and Isfahan.

The general width of the valley in which the Ab-i-Gargar runs is about one mile ; its banks are of marl and stand at steep slopes. At / miles small irrigation channel is crossed and the road runs over well-irrigated country# At 9 miles a white tower, known as the Sahib-un-Nabbi is passed. At 10 miles is the village of Khuid Buleh and one and half miles further on the village of Bunar. At 13 miles small canal is crossed, and at 14 miles the wharf is reached at which boats generally discharge their cargoes for Shushtar. A little further on the villages called Shalaill and Mahi Bazan are passed. At 18 miles the road goes through a cutting and then over some undulating ground, and then through another cutting about 600 yards long and into the well cultivated plain of Shushtar. The ground is much broken up by ravines and canals. Before reaching the town the bridge of Pul-i-Laskar, some 50 feet iong and 10 feet broad is crossed. The road, generally speaking, throughout the stage, is narrow and bad. rn 5 AB-I-BlD 19.—-General direction N. . W. The road crosses the Ab-i-Shatait about a quarter of a mile below the bridge which is broken in the middle, by means of tallies (rafts on inflated skins). The river in spring is about 400 yards in breadth, with a current of 3J to 4 miles per hour. The passage is dangerous for animals and the crossing is attended with considerable delay. Leaving the river- bank the track gradually ascends over stony ground towards the hills and by a final steep, though short, ascent it passes through the Gardan-i-RIsh-i-gir, at 3 miles. In the summer this is a favourite spot of the marauding Arabs for looting travellers. An easy descent now follows on to the Aqili plain, which bears most luxuriant crops. At miles the road is abreast of the village of Jallakhan, which is about one mile to74 Route No, ll—condd, the right, and situated on the right bank of the Karun, The river here has made a great bend to the west and almost en circles on its left bank the best part of the ’Aqili plain.

The track runs through wheat cultivation from here on to Ab-i-Bid, at 19 miles. The village which lies on the bank of the stream has a kaleh with a population of 1,200 (in the winter only), besides large herds of cattle and sheep.

Further on, at 8 J miles, several broad and stony channels of the Ab-i-Karmak, extending over two miles, and flowing south-east, are crossed. In the spring rains these are strong running streams up to 120 feet in width and 3 or 4 feet deep, but always fordable. In the summer they cease to exist. A gradual rise thence to Ilf miles is succeeded by undulating ground with watercourses to 13| miles. The road then tra verses a plateau two miles wide, from which there is a slight drop across undulating cultivated;land intersected by water channels into Pizful. The town has an imposing, appearance when ap proached from this side, and extends over a considerable area of ground. It is situated on the left bank of the Ab-i-Diz, and from that side presents a very picturesque sight, with its houses overhanging the river to a height of over 200 feet. It has a population of some 25,000 and is probably one of the filthiest towns in the universe.

At about 8 miles the road ascends out of the valley by a bad ascent of some 500 feet by means of a winding path, which in places is a mere staircase cut in the soft rock. The remainder of the route is over smooth and easy going. The road now runs between gypsum hills, when the neighbourhood of the river is again reached. Just before reaching Gurgir at 14 miles, a sulphurous stream is crossed. The old Gurgir is about two and a half miles fur ther on, and two small villages on the site of the former Tambih have taken its name. There is a certain amount of cultivation surrounding these villages. Water. —The fresh water from a small stream is hardly drink able owing to pollution from the villages.

The fords are rough, bottom full of large boulders, water I foot deep in April, 6 ' deep in October. Water salt and quite undrinkable. Just after the tenth crossing there is a steep ascent of 400 yards by a zigzaged path and a steep but easier descent to Qaleh Madraseh at mile 12 . At Qaleh Madraseh there is a small stream of fresh water, a little rice cultivation and some ancient ruins. Supplies in small quantities can be obtained in the winter months from nomad encampments in the vicinity. Leaving Qaleh Madraseh the river is crossed for the eleventh and last time and the road now gradually ascends the Murdafil pass. Going very rough and the last mile extremely steep and difficult by zigzags. The summit is reached at mile 15. The foot is reached at mile 17 where there is a caravanserai, known as Caravanserai-Agha Mehrab. Fresh water from stream, no fodder or supplies.

From Minaftun to Tambih the road leads over gach hills and is very steep and difficult in places. Thence to Sar Tiyuk the road is easy over gently undulating ground, the gach hills south of Gurgir offering little difficulty. From Sar Tiyuk to Ramuz : difficult and even dangerous in places amongst low rocky hills of up-ended strata. The gach- north of Ramuz is particularly difficult for large caravans. If a cart road be projected the physical obstacles would be many. A Pioneer Regiment working for a week on each of stages 1 and 3 could make the track reasonable for laden mules.

No difficulty for small bodies of troops, if the killiks are available : horses and cattle are made to swim across, but sheep and goats are usually placed on the raft. ( 2 ) Tang-i-Dulau: steep, rocky and in places dangerous for mules with clumsy loads. Camels could not use it.

At 16 miles commence descent into the Karun valley, zig-zagging down the side to the Gudar, near which are generally some nomad tents. The Gudar is on a straight stretch of the river. It is also known as the Gudar-i-Khani. Alternative ferries are : down stream Gudar-i-Gazistun; up stream Pa-i-Pul-i-Landar, the former much, the latter little, used. [Note. —There is a track from Gudar-i-Landar to Maidan-i-Naftun 16 miles. General direction south-south-west. Ascending the steep slope of the Karan valley, strike south by several alternative tracks over the gach. The most frequently used track passes Bard-i-Nishandeh, a stone pillar about 15 feet high (q.v.), a second track strikes east of this place, rejoining the firstnamed track at 7 miles. A difficult, steep stony ravine is now descended and the stream at the bottom followed for 1 mile. The road then ascends inclined strata over a ridge, whence Masjid-i-Sulaiman can be seen, marked by a large Jcunar tree : this point is reached at 12 miles. The road now follows a stream draining south to Maidan-i-Naftun and the Tambi river, and is easy for pack animals.

From the 82 water mill at Bard-i- Qamchi proceed S.-E. up Daireh Kaleh; ascending the hill for 500 feet at once, and continuing along its steep and difficult slopes. At 2 miles strike the first of a series of oil springs, the product of which is regularly burnt for pitch. The lower part of the valley is well-cultivated, rice being the chief crop. Ancient walled hill terraces and ruined houses abound, indicating a large settled population at some past period, possibly that of the Atabegs, when they ruled from Malamlr. The track from 5 to 5 miles is difficult and even dangerous over shale slopes. At 7 miles extensive ruins of no special interest. At 8 miles enter tract of Darreh Shami inhabited by numerous families of the Rewa Haft Lang. At 8 miles the stream receives a tributary from the N. At 13 miles cross to N. side of stream, but at once recross and proceed through tract of Gud Nargisi. The river bed is now dry, but there is a small fresh spring at 11 miles.

Close to it is the large spring of “ Sardab (cold stream), which gushing out of the rock J mile off, pours as a foaming torrent straight into the Karun just below the remains of a large and ancient stone bridge. This would indicate the importance of the road over the Gurab pass in former times. A tem porary structure of wood near Rustam! answers its purpose now. At 7J miles pass hamlet of Shahzadeh; thence into ’Al! Kuh, at this time a city of the dead. All the inhabitants have disappeared, partly for want of water, partly as Illdts.

On the left bank of the other ” stream is seen another severe rift, the Tang-i-Kufia, through which bends a small stream allowing room for a mule track leading from the Duab valley over the Gardan-Gil-i- Surkh (i.e., red earth), close to a very red-looking hill top to Birgun and onwards. Through the rift is seen a cultivated upland valley, Mish Mal-i-Kuh. Another cultivated habita tion high up the Kuh-i-Maisru is known as Asbauar. The track continues up the right bank of the Duab to its source, which is at the foot of the pass over the Chari range; but this track is stony, and is only used by those wishing to proceed to the cultivated plots and tree plantations in this long valley near the water’s edge known as Dez Darun, in the centre of ■of which out of the foot of the still snow-clad Kuh-i-Milli (or Asbiuni), gushes another of those ready made magnificent streams, adding much to the volume of the river into which they boisterously fall.

The ends of this range forming the tangl on either side have sloping spurs over which about 300 feet above the river-bed goes the main track on the left bank. The peaks are about 1,000 feet above the road, and fully command the entrances and approaches. The country is as usual treeless and shrubless but with excellent pasturage. Midway in the tangl a spur projects almost across it, which forms a suitable place for a tactical barrier. The Zindeh Rud on emerging from the tangl leaves the Bakhtiari country of mud hills, separates at first Raridan from the Chehar Mahals, and then slowly winds its way through lower Mahallat towards Isfahan. The village Lidigan is in Chehar Mahal, and Chehil Chashmeh (forty springs) is in Faridan. Camp 1 mile north-east of tangl. At the northern mouth where camp was pitched is a tumulus, said to be of very ancient date, called Kaugunak. From here a good road runs north about 15 miles to Askandaria (stage 4, Route 24) where water is plentiful and supplies are available. Askandaria has same 200 houses, 2,500 live stock. 6 6 CAMP NEAR THE 12J.—Leaving Camp took CHASHMEH- a track leading over 64J I-DIMEH, the Garaganaki range ^^lO' back to the Bakh tiari country. It was a very good and easy track through the col figured 9,350 feet taking two hours to reach from Camp. The Garganaki range is very broad-topped, and has many small up-land valleys in which Illdt camps are scattered about. For, though hot, the neighbourhood affords excellent grazing all the summer through. From the Gardan-i-Garganaki moved along an excellent track due south for two hours, about 6 miles. Half-way crossed the Gurba valley and stream, 7,550101 Route No. 2()- -contd. feet; then followed up the Zindh Rud valley, and camped near the Chashmeh-i-Duneh, one of the main sources of the Zindeh Rud. I Bats abundant, also fodder and firewood. Close to the spring are the ruins of a square left fort. From here a good track along the right bank of the stream, and a better on the left, leads up the Gurba valley to the Gardan- i-Bard-i-Mir Jamal, 15 miles. The rise to 9,880 feet is imper ceptible except for the last two miles, when it is perceptible but yet easy. The col is flat for | mile with a good camping- ground and water. It is commanded by peaks on either side which rise to 12,000 feet. The valley passed through is a large wide grazing ground treeless, but with many springs and rivulets. From here an excellent track over low mud hills crosses the Ab-i-Chamandar and enters the Shurab valley skirting its western edge, moves up a ravine parallel to the Karun range and over a col, Chelgird, 8,750 feet, into the Karun upper valley. Just before entering the ravine leading to the col is the Imamzadeh Agha-i-Sahib. From here a road runs over the Gil-i-Shah Lerdakus pass. Track good to entrance of tangi, 8,300 feet, crossing 2 streams, en route, distance 3 miles. From the entrance to the tangi the path is stony for J mile. Then struck snow, and a very easy zigzag ascent for 2 miles to the top. Elevation 11,300 feet. Pass at this time, June, quite feasible for pack animals and in great request by the Ilidts. The southern descent is also easy by zigzags though the abruptness of the slope of the hill, a sheer drop of 3,000 feet makes it look imposing. At the foot of the pass is a camping place with trees and water, whence the road to Shushtar via Chihlan can be seen. 7 G ARD AN -1 - G A V 13J.—Ascend by the — Gardan or Gal-i-Gav 78 (the cow pass) by an excellent mule track up the stream coming from the Kuh-i- Rang. After H miles enter the spurs of this mountain at a prettily watered spot with flour mills called Safir Diveh, an excellent camping ground. Another such long open space, affording a good camping ground, is passed at the 3rd or 4 th mile by name Chaman Shaikh ‘All Khan, having a good spring known as Chashmeh-i-Gulchin. After this, rise gradually over the Kuh-i-Rang spurs as they spread to the south. At the 7th mile enter a valley, where the main track from the102 Route No. 26— contd . Pambakal Pass, now in full view, joins. At the 8 th mile., after crossing another spur, descend into the Lah Zard (green valley), 9,200 feet with nice encamping space and plenty of water. This was once a fertile spot judging from the long aqueducts cut into the side of the large spurs. At the 9th mile another space known as Agha Murad (9,500 feet). At the 10th mile the track leads over another high spur (9,800 feet) and then descends into an open valley, Juh-i- Jar, well dotted over by Mat encampments. The track now rises perceptibly, though never without being easy, stoneless, and excellent in dry weather, for 3 | more miles to the col known as gardan (or Gal-i-Gav) at an altitude of 10,150 feet.

It is an excellent mule track, passing over the cross spurs of the large spur from head of the Kuh-i-Rang. At 4 miles steepish, but quite good enough bit, leads into the valley of the Chilhash, which torrent coming from the Kuh-i-Rang is reached at the 6 th mile (7,800 feet). Two miles further down the stream from this point is the Imamzadeh and village of Pir Sar Sahld,* prettily situated in a * Note.—S awyer gives the following two routes from Sar Sahid to Dizful but without distances.

This village is on the main track to the garmslrs round Dizful. From here took the main track used by the Illdts passing along the crest of the Rissa hill, 8,500'. Leaving the hamlet of Birgun in a deep valley on the left at the 8 th mile, reached camp at the foot of the large spur from the Kuh-i-Rang, and on the stream Chilhash, at the 10th mile. No supplies, but an Jtidt encampment close by. 9 CHASMEH SIRDUM 12.—Track ascends the 7 , 000 '. col to camp known as 100 the Birgun Kutal and then descends into a long ravine with torrent for 3J miles by zigzag road to where another ravine with torrent is joined at a place replete with trees, affording grateful dark shade from overhanging rock and waterfall known as Sirpul (6,800 feet). Half a mile further the thickly-wooded Warreh Rasia from the Kuh-i-Rang is entered, and the track taken up the valley on either side of a rushing stream for 3 miles another favourite camping ground (7,500 feet) at the foot of the ascent to come. This ascent over the mightly spur from the Gartak peak of the Kuh-i-Rang is steep in parts, but has an excellent mule track and offers no difficulties to being ridden on horse-back the whole way. Though only half a mile in horizontal projection, the ascent took half an hour and the top registered 9,200 feet. The descent is less steep, and the track passes over several minor spurs from the main spur, the intervening ravines having springs of excellent water at the 12 th mile. After 5 hours’ march, camp was found in one of the lesser ravines, where excellent fodder, water, and fuel were at hand. 10 PUL-I-GAUKUN 10 .—Continue along the -— 6,800' main track over the 110 main portion of the ^Gartak spur. One and a half hours’ climb to top of pass which is 9,680 feet. The track has two rocky bits requiring a little care to pick out a path, but is otherwise an excellent mule track. Steep in parts, but stoneless. Descent into the Gaukun valley steep also, and the lower portion has a bad bit of rock for about 50 yards, which was, however, negotiated by horses and fully laden mules without difficulty. Track continuesKoute No. 26 — contd. down stream for a short way, and ascends a slippery piece of chalk hill side. On reaching the top, main track bifurcates, one to north-east up a Icutal to the GarganakI range, thence to Kalasur, the other goes down the valley to the Pul-i-Gaukun, and then ascends to col between the Farldun and the Shahan hill tops. Camp at 1 J miles from the bridge. The Gaukun stream flows at right angles to all the large Kuh-i-Rang spurs, and at this place has somewhat receding cultivated banks for 2 miles. This open space is known as Gaukun. The stream enters this space through a narrow tangi, and leaves it two miles further down through another one, narrow with perpendicular sides, up to 2,000 feet high. 11 GARDAN-I-KAMA- 7.—Up the valley between RUN, 9,500' the Shahan and 117 Faridun ranges. The track ascends a spur of the Shahan, which is separated from the Faridun hill by a narrow deep gorge through which flows the Kamarun stream into the Gaukun. At 1J miles the col of this spur is reached, and a slight descent is made into a fertile, well-watered upland valley 5 miles long, having the hamlet of Kamarun on a streamlet prettily situated about half-way. At the 7th mile from tho Gaukun a col is reached (Gardan-i-Kamarun). Here camp was made. A capital mule track, stoneless, and, still within a few feet of the top, over smooth spurs well covered with vegetation, enables the Shahan peak to be reached with ease riding on horse-back. The central peak is 12,900 feet, a few feet higher than the Kuh-i-Rang, and from it the two highest peaks of the Zardeh Kuh are estimated as between 13,000 and 14,000 feet; the last-named figure is certainly not reached. 12 MASIR MUGUVI 12.—General direction 8 , 100 ' N.-W. Continue 129 down the Muguvi valley westwards, known as the Pashandagan or Samistan valley from two hamlets of that name situated in it. At the 3 rd mile from the col a streamlet is struck which flows through a narrow but highly cultivated valley with both banks enshrouded in bushes, the path follows it down for 5 miles, when another stream is crossed, flowing from the Shahan range through the higher valley and hamlet of Samistan. At the105 Route No. 26 — contd. 9th mile the hamlet of Pashandagan is reached. Hence the stream takes a more southerly course, hemmed in by precipi tous banks. From here, passing through the hamlet of Samis- tan, a mule track leads over the high range by the Chukashan pass into the Faridan, low lands beyond. The main track now leaves the valley and hamlet of Pashandagan (7,700 feet)' and at once ascends a spur by a zigzag smooth path for a height of 1,500 feet. From a knoll close to this col (9,200 feet), a good view is had of the country to the south. Hence the track passes the hamlet and cultivated area of Home, and after going over another spur from the main range, descends into the Masir Muguvi valley. Village of Masir surrounded with cultivation,, near a stream. 13 GUVEH, 6,500' 12.—General direction N. - W. Track up 141 the valley, along a stream till a col is reached at the 3rd mile showing 8,800 feet. Hence the track descends into another straight valley closely hemmed in on the south by a range sharply faced, and to the north by the well-cultivated spurs of the Miligun range, the continuation in the same alignment of the Shahan range. Following an excellent track, passing now through corn-fields, now along the bank of a stream shaded by pollard and elm,, the village of Tarseh is passed at the 5th mile, that of Sarkaleh at the 6 th, Dehnau on the left bank at the 8 th, and the village and cross valley of Guveh at the 12 th mile. Guveh Tang I is im passable for mules, but a foot-path exists. The tangi and the valley about here is thickly-wooded. Stream 6,400 feet. 14 KALEH HUM A* 13.—General direction N.-N.-E. The track 154 after crossing the stream by a wooden bridge at once ascends, steeply but easily, * 3 * Note. Kaleh Huma to DizM (from native information).

The main track goes on in the same general direction to the Zaugi country, but a good road leads off to Kaleh Huma about 2 miles further on. The shorter mule track was taken leading over the range. The track is an ex cellent, easy zigzag, for 1,400 feet. The hutal and a peak close to it (9,650 feet) afford a full view of the surrounding country. The track descends easily for 800 feet, and then moves along the foot of the range, leading over a low spur at 9th mile (8,400 feet), and then makes straight for Kaleh Huma across the plain. At the 10 th mile the village Raceh and at the 11th the village Haveh, conspicuous on a slight elevation, are passed, and at the 12 th mile a stream is forded, and the ascent made to Kaleh Huma. Kaleh Huma is the capital of the Mugvi tribe. The Kaleh is a mud caravanserai surrounded by mud and stone houses. It is situated at the foot of a large spur from the Talanda hill and is visible from all parts of the open valley. Numerous springs in the neighbourhood and good grazing. Armenian villages scattered about here. 15 15 MAKHADl 8 .—Urom Huma are two .— — good tracks, one a 162 few miles shorter over a col; the other following the water-course through a tangi in a chain of low hills. The latter track chosen. An excellent dry weather one over stoneless mud spurs. At 3 miles pass the remains of a village burnt down in a raid. At the 5th mile the Ivaz Tangi (6,900 feet) is entered, and the track changes to the left bank of the stream (the Ab-i-Garmak). The defile, about 100 yards broad and bounded by steep mud hills (400 feet to 500 feet), is 2 miles long. At the southern end, on a -conspicuous crag, the abrupt end of a spur, are the remains of a castle or stone building of ancient date known as Kaleh-i- Dukhtar. It is in a commanding position, and in former days might have been made impregnable. At its foot, 800 feet below, runs the stream, here joined by another water-course from the west named Darreh Shikaft. These two streams make the Vanavi for a few miles, which, when joined by the Ab-i-Safid, 2 miles lower down, becomes the Kakulistan, and when joined by the Gaukan and Gava at Baznul, the Ab-i- Diz. The track now descends into the Makhadi (7,600 feet) valley, the first Zallaki possession encountered. Makhadi,H miles, 5,000 feet. From Makhadi a track to Sang Kaleh descends more than a thousand feet to the bed of the Kakulistan (6,300 feet) which stream, now 20 yards wide and 3b feet deep, has cut for itself a channel through mud hills and rocky ranges- regardless of natural formations, and forms an important physical feature of this country. Owing to the low altitude' of its bed and immediate vicinity, and its narrow defiles here and there, it is discarded as a habitat, and possesses no track along its course. The high, flat broad mud spurs alongside form the cultivable portions on which the Iliats from neigh bouring villages reside. After crossing to the right bank the track to Sangkaleh moves up a high spur at once, and makes an abrupt cliff and surrounded by groups of trees. The Biz consists of half-a-dozen semi-artificial caves with breast high loopholed rubble walls. One cave contains a perennial spring* Close above Arjanak is a small lake 100 yards by 50. From here there is a good path up a ravine, to the Gal-i-Badash, which soon ascends into one of the large spurs of the Kaleh Kuh. After 12 miles along a good horse and mule track the Gal-i-Badash is reached. Camp at spring about 300 feet below * 4 excellent track. Track follows bed of the Muar-i-Zarun stream which is 20 feet wide and 2 feet deep. Enter the Haziwand territory. From here there is an excellent track ascending the Gal-i-Chukan.

DIZFUL di 60' Bii .1 - d / oi dd ft \y- By the river Diz from Band-i- Qir, During the spring rises of the river, navigation is possible for a large light draugut steamer as far as Deh-i-Kfau, about 100 miles by river, and 20 miles from Dizful by land, but there is no surveyed route on record between these points. As far as Kut Bandar, the river is navigable throughout the year for small steamers ; distance from Bandi-i-QIr between 70 and 80 miles. The course of the river is very tortuous, through flat uncultivated plains, and extensive jungles. The Arabs on the banks muster about 2,000 strong ; about half are armed with M.-H. rifles. Provisions,, such as meat, wheat and barley and perhaps some mules might be obtained at Saiyid Ahmad Tafik’s encampment on the right bank. At present no native boats trade on the river. On March 18, 1893, the stern-wheel steamer Shushan ascended the Diz as far as Jisir, about 14 miles from Dizful, in a direct line. The river is from 100 to 250 yards wide. The current runs at 3 knots below and 5 knots above Kut Bandar.— {Plant)..

The west bank of the Diz is barren and devoid of undergrowth, but the east bank is thickly wooded from the junction of the Kharur to Deh Nau. At 45 miles cultivation is reached, the fields being watered by canals from the Shaur; at 52 miles low hills are crossed offering no diffi culty. Six miles to north and south of Shush extensive irri- gated and unirrigated cultivation is encountered. The Diz is in spate in April and May for about a month, and then floods the country between the Kharur and Sharish ; at this time the road would be impassable. Heavy rain would make the road impassable for a few days. Physical obstacles.—( 1 ) Kharur river* This stream flows in a deep narrow bed and must be bridged if the road is to be used at all by carts, or regularly by mule caravans. A bridge with a span of 22 to 25 feet would probably be ample. The banks are of alluvial soil and firm. Baliams can ascend river from the Diz for at least 2 miles. The approximate dimensions of the river in a very dry December were :~Depth of water 5 ', width 18', width of river-bed from bank to bank at desert level 45^ current 3 miles per hour. ( 2 ) Sharish — {a) small creek, 4' deep and fi 7 broad ; could be filled up with fascines ; a single pipe of 2 ' diameter in centre would be ample to provide for the flow, which is almost nil. (b) A larger creek about 20 yards broad, 5 / deep in centre, could be dealt with in the same way as (a), with 2 pipes in centre*136 Route No. 35—contd. 'flow of water very small; brushwood ad lib, available on east bank of Diz. SKI (XAWHA) HSTklTK (c) A strip of marsh 100 yards broad, and always about 1 ' 6 ' deep in water ; muddy but fairly firm bottom ; could be adapted to wheeled traffic by a corduroy causeway of fascines. Safety of road. —If traffic were being carried on by this road with the sanction and support of Shaikh Khaz’al, the only danger to caravans would be from incursions of the semi independent tribes living on the banks of the Karvheh, such as the Khasraj ; also to a less extent from the unrulv tribes living on the east of the Diz, and until lately under' Shaikh Farhan. The land actually traversed by the road belongs almost entirely to tribes well under control, i.e .— Near La’ imi . . . Burwaiyir (Buvair ?) Arabs. Shaur . . . . ’Anafijeh. Nor^h of Shrish . . .... Shaikh Shabail. South of low hills . . . Saiyid Ahmad. North of low hills . . . Shaikh Haidar. If regular traffic on the road be projected, it would be almost essential to build a walled caravanserai at each regular halting place, in order to guard against raid, and also to contain supplies of fodder, which could not be obtained locally. Miscellaneous. —Railway metalling available at Aminleh, from sands on hills. Railway metalling available at Shush, from river-beds. Trial pits in low hills south of Shush might disclose gravel beds. i Water. No difficulty as long as the Karun, Shaur, Sharish. ■or Diz are depended on ; nil elsewhere, except from wells here and there in the desert; water can be obtained anywhere by digging. Fuel. —Plentiful everywhere. Fodder. Grazing in poor everywhere ; a little all the year round along the banks of the Diz and Shaur. Supplies. Practically nil except near Shush, where up to 500 mules or horses could be regularly supplied with fodder on notice being given to Shaikh Haider. Elsewhere along the road animals are fed on camel thorn and millet: barley' and straw being seldom obtainable.

The 10 / road leaves the town of Muhammareh skirtmg the northern wall, at first in an easterly direction. ; The soil is clay and in many places swampy ; date plantations occur here and there. At mile 1 the road becomes a mere track across the mud flat. The country is barren to the north but a belt of cultivation fringes the Karan. At. mile 2 J the route lies over country which becomes a vast swamp in the spring rains. At mile 4J a small village and date plan tation about 1 mile to the right. The going after rain is heavy and swampy. At mile 7 Qisbeh a small village of reed and straw huts is passed. It is situated on the left bank of a muddy creek, about 50 yards wide by 3 feet deep, which frequently presents considerable difficulty in fording. There is usually a site for a camp three miles further on, opposite Dair Island, but the actual site depends on the state of inundation and the state of the river with reference to a suitable place for bringing barges alongside. Grazing for camels is available, but for no other animals. Generally speaking this route is rendered impassable during flood seasons but when the Karan river alone is in flood and not the Shatt-al-Arab as welly it is sometimes possible to find a land route (which however would not be passable for wheels by reason of the narrowness of the roadway of two bridges over small canals between Muhammareh and Manduwan) by making a wide circuit inland starting in a northerly direction, passing 2 miles from the village of Manduwan and then proceeding east and joining the river upstream of the Qisbeh Creek. This adds over four miles to the distance of the stage. This was the route which it was proposed the 23rd Cavalry (F. F.), should follow on the 20th May 1915 ; when, however, the Shaft- ai-Arab also rose, this route too become impassable, and the regiment was conveyed from Muhammareh to near Salmaneh by boat.

If the main track, which is the best, be followed, the Kash gan is followed in a north-north-east direction to 5 J miles, where it bends north-north-west: at 6 miles the road leaves it and ascends the Paru Pariz valley which is open, devoid of gach and cultivated. The track winds gently up the valley by easy gradients and for the first 3 miles only needs clearing of stones to be a good cart track. The last part of the ascent to the low pass 4,400' which separates the Paru Pariz valley from the Rumishgan plain is steep ; easy for mules, but would need grading for carts. At 11 miles a track diverges direct to Chashmeh Kalag Rud on the track to Madian Rud. At 12 miles ’Ali Gijan Imamzadeh is reached at the head of the Ru mishgan plain.

Epitome .—-This route has frequently been used in the past- owing to the impassability of the routes up the Saidmarreh valley. On leaving Pa-i-Pul-i-Karkheh it enters Pusht-i-Kuh territory, in which it runs till the crest of the Kablr Kuh is crossed at any one of several points. Thence to the Said marreh river the country is occupied by the Zainiwand under^ Mir Said Muhammad Khan, a subject of the Vali, but to some extent under the influence of the Sarclar Akram. Thence to Khurramabad it runs through territory controlled as far as the Kashgan directly and from the Kashgan to the towns indirectly by Nazar ’Ali Khan Sardar Akram (1911). There is a fairly good road throughout, better probably than any other track in Luristan. It needs clearing of stones. Snow falls on the portions of the route above 4,000 feet, but not enough to block traffle for more than a day or two. The heat in summer would render is advisable for caravans south i of the Kabir Kuh to move by night, as a rule. The physical obstacles met with are the Kabir Kuh, in: the ascent of which there is a short difficult space ; the Karkheh,, over which are several fords passable for mules in autumn- only, at which season the water reaches the mule loads ; the Saidmarreh and the Kashgan, both passable for mules only from July to November.

The valley is bounded by rocky hills on either side, and the road is in places a mere mule track though easily convertible to wheels. At 3| miles a track diverges to Kamalwand and Zad, whence Zagheh can be reached. The main road turns north-north-east through Tang-i-Zaideh Shir (4,900') across a grassy cultivated plateau : south of the tang stands an Imamzadeh. The gorge is 4,300 yards wide and rocky hills 1,000' on either side. The route follows the stream across the Taijareh plateau, left at 9 miles, through a rocky gorge, and enters the Deh Safid plateau 3,500' con tinuing north-west. The Darreh Daraz valley is now ascended : the track keeps to the west side of the valley to avoid a gorge ; and ascends a steep pass, which could easily be improved, to Kaleh Kurisi, a ruined mud fort (6,000'). At this point a track diverges over Kuh Bumani (7,000') to Darreh Saki 6,200' in the Hurud valley, 8 miles distant. The track des cends again into the Darreh Daraz valley occupied by ’Ali Khanl Sagwands : portions known as Chinar Badar and Abis- dan are passed, and, at 19J miles (5,900'), the ascent out of the valley is commenced over the Zagheh pass, summit 7,200': ascent and descent on either side are steep.

Mounted men can cross this ford in 7 minutes. A guide should be obtained from Sheikh Mushatat. Easily fordable by cavalry in sections. 3. The third ford, sometimes called Mahellijah, is 2 miles south of the Bu Amu Ford and 5J miles S.-S.-W. of Shush. This ford runs directly across the stream for 50 yards (greatest depth 3 ' S') to a pebbly spit, then along the crest of the spit (over which the river flows) for 300 yards when a sandy strip is reached. The last seventy yards has a maximum depth of 2' T\ Mounted men could cross in 5 minutes from bank to bank. In August, 1916, this ford was passable for pack trans port but it is doubtful if it would ever become passable for loaded carts on account of the strong stream in the last 70 yards. Both banks of the river are here jungle clad. Entrance and exit are easy over sand and pebbles. Easily fordable by cavalry in sections.

Brom this point to the oil springs on the river, in a gorge, is 4 miles, along the east or left bank of the stream, which is known higher up as the Ab-i- Daman. At the point where the track crosses the river, the bed is full of large boulders, and the banks on either side are high and almost perpendicular ; the construction of a cart road would involve great labour at this point. Carts, however, could be brought up to the cliff on the dast side of the gorge, and above the oil springs, by a track which diverges from that described about 3 miles before reaching the Ab-i-Talazi, and runs north-west to the gorge.

Epitome .—This road may conveniently be divided into two sections : I. The part traversing the mountainous tract from Deh Bala to where it emerges on to the Tigris plain at Kalateh (8), lOOf miles in length. II. The part following the Tigris plain to the Karkheh river ? which it crosses to Dizful and which is 84 miles long. In Section I the road traverses the intricate hills lying be tween the wall-like range of the Kabir Kuh and the Tigris plain. The road is in parts very narrow and steep and is impassable for artillery. Owing, however, to the calcareous nature of the ground and the quantity of gypsum found in the hills, mules can obtain a good foothold on the track. This part of the road is most easily traversed from March to une inclusive. Then forage is most abundant, the crops stand ing or just reaped, and the tribes with their flocks and herds are camped adjacent to the tracts traversed by the road. During the autumn forage is less plentiful and the tribes move to re moter valleys. From November to March the country is mainly deserted the tribes migrating to the Tigris pMn. In Section II the road traverses an almost level plain and is practicable for all arms on any breadth of front. The Tigris p ain from Kalateh to the Karkheh river is, however, only181 Koute No. 45^^— contd. practicable for troops from October to March. During the rest of the year it is almost deserted. In October the tribes of Pusht- i-Kuh descend from the mountains bringing with them large flocks and herds. The Indian-corn is then ripe and the desert always provides a certain quantity of grass. In February the approach of spring provides the most luxuriant herbage which dries with the first heat of March and April, during which months the tribes migrate to the hill country. It is apparent therefore that this section is traversable by troops in winter and spring only. In the winter the direct road from Kalateh to Deh Bala, Section I should not be attempted, but the level road to Zorbatiyah, route No. 46, should be followed. I. Little rain falls after May, but from November and May showers are frequent and heavy. II. From June to September the heat is very great. Water. —I. Abundant. II. Procurable throughout, except in the tract between the Jlk and the Karkheh rivers, stage 12. It is, however, often impregnated with salts and sulphur. Fuel.- —I. As far as Khuskhadul (stage 3) wood is plentiful adjacent to the road ; from there to Kalateh fuel is procurable, only from the mountains, generally some miles distant. II. Scarce ; at some stages scrub fuel, but at most there is none. The passage of the Karkheh river from November to May would require special arrangements if the fords were impracti cable. Skilled local guides are absolutely necessary for the passage of the river at any season. Forage.—I. Plentiful throughout the year, the grass being especially luxuriant in the spring and early summer. II. Vide above, “Road” II. Supplies. —I. The crops of wheat and barley are green m April and ripen during May to July according to elevation.. From Arkavaz (stage 2) to the Mama river (stages 5 to 8), cultivated lands are adjacent to the road. The autumn crop of Indian-corn is scanty and insufficient for the supply of a foice of anv size. From April to October vast numbers of sheep and goats and some cattle are pastured. In the earlier months they are on the lower levels near the road, and in the autumn recede to the remoter valleys and higher elevations.182 Route No. 45— contd. II. Vide “ Road ” above. In no case should infantry endeavour to follow this section of the route until arrangements for supplies have been made with the tribes and the Vali of Pusht- i-Kuh; or if unaccompanied by cavalry, whose services would be absolutely necessary for foraging. Alternative stages. — {a). Deh Bala to Deh Luran (stage 9). Distance practically the same. Route practicable for pack transport. Supplies scanty. Water plentiful, except in stages 2 and 8. Impregnated with sulphur in stage 4. (b) Route 44 can be used as an alternative from Deh Luran to Shushtar instead of to Dizful. • : (c) Kalateh (stage 8) to the Karkheh river (stage 12).

Road this stage is passable for guns up to 7| miles. After that artillery cannot pass, though the road is a good trank for laden animals. In spring time a route is followed which avoids crossing the river as far as possible. In the autumn and the hot weather, when the river is low the most direct route is taken. Husaimeh consists of two forts belonging to the Vail of Pusht-i- Kuh, and forming his winter residence ; the lower fort is on the right bank of the river ; the other is west of it on higher ground, 200 yards away. Both are completely commanded within close rifle range by hills on the south-east, and west sides. The valley is 200 yards wide and bordered by bare rugged i 11s.

Description is 87 i •&gt; allii ni taken from Vaughan. Road over level ground, irrigated and swampy, and covered first with gardens and cultivation and then with willow bushes to 1 mile, where the river is crossed to avoid ascending a spur. Then cross again and proceed up the left bank of the river. The cliffs on either side are about -} mile apart, but close in to 100 yards. This is the Tang-i-Gunjan Cham. The road when the river is in flood in the spring time runs along higher up on the rifdit on the side of the ravine. At If miles reach a point where the united stream formed by two streams, one from Chini Malik and the other from the Imamzadeh Khasa ’AH, join the Gunjan Cham river. Cross the river; two streams, 20 feet broad and 18 inches deep, bed stony. The track here divides. The one on the right is used when the river is in flood in the spring time. Take the one on the left and pass along the united two streams, up a gorge crossing and re-crossing the stream. At 2| miles reach the point where the stream from the Imamzadeh Khasa ’AH joins the stream from Chini Malik from the left. Up the right bank of the Chini Malik stream, the first portion of the road being cut in the hillside and revetted with brushwood. Cross the stream and ascend into broken ground at three miles, where the other track from If miles joins in again. Cross several irrigation streams, and pass through some cultivation, elevation 1,530 feet. At of miles pass the village of Amirabad about 10 houses with trees and gardens about f mile on the right of the road. At 7| miles cross a hollow down which a copious fresh water irrigation stream finds its way. At 8 miles cross a salt stream in a hollow. At 10J miles pass a pyramidal shaped pillar or obelisk with an inscription. It marks the tomb of a former Vail of Luristan, and is known as the MU-a-Kutchalli. Several more similar monuments are dotted about the Bahnravan plain which is now being traversed. They form good landmarks and are denoted by the Lurs by the name of “ mil.” Maunsell did not follow quite the same path as Vaughan apparently ; his description of this stage is therefore also given. Up the pebbly bed of the stream. The valley here is 200 yards wide and people were cutting grass for hay by the water’s edge. Some of the stones were incrusted with white saline deposit from the water. The water itself was bitter but drinkable.205 Route No. 46 . s, '■ - ' — t , , I 'V'.' i . • . . p|' ( ff ( ' ! fj p&gt; fv- • Ascend a spur SO' high to avoid crossing the river. Descend and at miles ford to the left bank. The track is rough over smooth rounded stones through a clump of oleander and tall sedges. Up the left bank of the main channel and at 2 miles cross it by a ford, 30 yards broad and 2 feet deep over a gravelly bottom. The river valley here is 400 yards wide, bounded by steep earth cliffs. Leave the wide valley and begin to enter the Tang-i-Gunjan Cham. The valley is 50 to 60 yards broad. The road is 3 to 4 feet wide and is well used track. Ascend by a series of short rough zigzags covered with loose stones and gravel with an occasional sheet of gypsum or soft white limestone. This ascent is by a ravine formed by a small tributary. The track now leads along the edge of an earth cliff, 150 to 200 feet high, streaked with gypsum, and up and down several small side ravines, it is narrowed in places where the earth has fallen into the river-bed. At 2J miles leave the edge of the Gunjan Cham river, the river flowing immediately below in a grave] bed, 200 to 300 yards wide, and the stream spreading over in a number of small channels. Cross a dry water course with a rough descent and ascent in and out, and turning sharp up it skirts for 200 yards. The ravine is 50 feet deep. At 5 miles emerge from the Tang-i-Gunjan Cham, the river of that name lying on the south side. Several streams from the north side of the plain unite and flow into the river near the mouth of the pass. They run in ravines with high clay banks eaten out of the soft soil. Soft white limestone appears here and there with an occasional stratum of gypsum or talc. Cross the Bahnravan plain, wide and bare and reach the Mil-a-Kutchalli on the left bank of a stream. Ford the stream 20 feet wide and 1 foot deep. The banks are 15 to 20 feet high of clay and gravel and the bed is lined with oleander reeds and a few tamarisk bushes. On the bank of the stream at 10 miles is a spring, Chin! Malik, water drinkable with only a slight brackish taste. Vaughan, continuing from the Mil-a-Kutchalli, says the road crosses a dry water-course and is good over the open plain of Bahnravan, and at 11J miles reach the stream containing a few inches of water, with bushes on its bank. Hoad this stage fair to If miles : then to 3 miles bad ; thence onward good. It is impassable for guns but fair for laden mules. When the river is in flood in the spring, the road is206 Route No. 46 — contd, TwSt'O’}—-'Oir ^JrJ ul i 0 ■ : i. : ' impassable, but the floods seldom last more than one or two Hi mi i-v* mrohdgnoi &gt; r ’M t?-b •&gt;; - Vi - •. .

Up the valley to If miles, where there is a stream about | mile to the right. Water is slightly brackish, but fit for animals and drink able for men. Ascend by a bad bit for about 100 yards and then over some hillocks. At 3§ miles a road joins in on the right from Deh Bala via Chasmeh Marbara and Tang-i-Kuh-i-Sultan, Alternative. Road now very good. At 7| miles the Imamzadeh Khasa ? A11 lies about 3J miles off near the foot of the hills bordering the plain on the south. It has a dome. Pass a nomad camp of a few huts and a ruined building on the left of the road. There is probably a spring of water within J mile of the camp in the direction of the hills. The plain or valley extends to the left for several miles and has bushes on it and some grass. The hills south of it are bare of trees, while those north of the road have a certain amount of small stunted ones. Then across the Hashdana valley keeping within | to 1 mile from the range on the right. The road runs over fairly level ground dipping every now and then into hollows down which the drainage from the range comes. Go on skirting the hills on the right in a north-north-west direction. At M miles reach a ruined building on the right of a water-course dry ir October ; a road from Mandali, 24 miles distant, comes in here, from die left. Then by the water-course and pass through a gap in the hills. The Tang-i-Niyaz has rocks on either side. Continue up the water-course* At 11J miles cross a stream of fresh water. This is the first fresh water met with since leaving ChinI Malik, the only other water being that passed at If miles. At 12f miles road again crosses the stream and ascends and runs up the left bank. Then again crosses the stream and ascends and passes a ruin of masonry on the left of the road at 13f miles. ThenRoute No. A xip the righA bank and at 13| miles cross the stream amid bushes. Up a ravine and ascend out of it into the level Niyaz Valley, elevation 5,220 feet. Cross it and leave it at 14| miles. Road ascending is bad. At 15 miles pass a small but good spring. At 15J miles cross a small water-course, dry in October except for pools. On up a gentle ascent on the side of the hills on the right, a valley on the left. Road now good ascending over wooded hills. At 16| miles cross their level summits, where a road comes in on the right, coming down the valley with the water-course which is crossed at the. bottom of the descent from the hills. This water-course comes down a valley from the hills on the right for about 3 miles. Then ascend over a low hill, and descend into the Chamba Valley. Troops can camp any where about the valley, where there are stretches of level ground. There is a short bit of bad road at If miles, and from Ilf miles to 13J miles the road is bad and impassable for guns. The remainder of the road is good and passable for guns.

At | mile cross the river by an easy crossing ; about 16 feet broad, water 16' deep, banks easy (October). The river comes through an opening in the hills, 100 yards to the right. Commence a steep ascent up the hills on the right, the road winding in that direction away from the river. The first f mile of the ascent is along a hill-side formed of loose shale at a steep angle. The road is held up to a great extent hy a brushwood revetment. At f mile ascent becomes less steep. The river appears through the hills on the right whereat there are at least two waterfalls of some height. There is said to be a difficult foot-path somewhere near its course which leads to Deh Bala. Then up a slope and ascend over the hills on the right. At If miles enter a ravine over some shelves of rock. At If miles pass a small spring of good water and some bushes close by.

At 21 miles through a ridge by a narrow defile. Pass through a defile called the Gardaneh-i-Khur-nuk. It is a rocky defile, 5 feet broad, between low r hills forming a ridge. The track winds about in every direction and, owing to sudden ascents in the track of from 2 to 3 feet over smooth rocks, it is difficult for horses and laden animals. At 3J miles leave the defile and ascend ; then on over and amongst low hills. 'Down into the dry water course and over a small col, passing a small spring at 4 miles. The road ascends steadily and passing through some broken ground. At 5 miles, a track comes in on the left from MandalL On up the valley^ leaving it and winding round the side of the hill on the right, and cross a low saddle at 5f miles. Descend down a narrow valley. Cross the river and ascend to 7 miles. Descend over a low spur on the left bank of the river by a steep track made in the hillside and revetted with brushwood. Cross the river at 7| miles and cross and recross it again in the next j mile. Road now runs up the right bank of the river between high hills covered with loose shale. The hills are wooded. Cross the river again by an easy crossing similar to the first one described and ascend gently to a ridge reached at 9| miles. This ridge, facing south, has the river on its right and a hill on its further bank and forms a good defensive position to protect the valley against an advance from the south up the river. Then to Deh Bala by a good broad track running up the valley. At 9| miles a track comes in on the right from Marbara. Road this stage is bad for the first 44 miles and good from the col for the last 7 miles. On account of the narrowness of the road in places and sudden abrupt ascents for a few feet, it is impass able for guns and difficult for mules. Were it blasted in about 20 different places, each of less extent than 5 yards in length, it would be a good road for pack animals. Deh Bala is situated in an extensive valley at the foot of the Manisht Kuh, There is room for a large force to camp. The place is the summer quarters of the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, Chief of the Fail! Lurs, Large numbers of mules are bred here. From here roads lead to Sar-i-Pul-Zuhab, Route No. 58 ; and to Dizful, Route No, 45 and to Shushtar. (Route No. 45, alternafive stages).

About 300 yards 146| after leaving Peh Bala pass the mouth of a fine hdriz with a copious supply of clear cold w’ater. Road here runs north and passes through a wooded' defile, 300 yards wide, having a dry stream bed down the centre and bordered by rough crags and precipices. At 2J miles reach the foot of the Daluva Pass. This defile is known as the Tang-i- Deh-Bala. Elevation 5,500 feet. Direction now changes to west. Ascend by a narrow track following a ravine. ■ At 3 miles, 5,850 feet up the right side of a rocky ravine, the track being over shelving sheets of limestone. At 3^ miles, 6,290 feet. Track follows very steep windings among boulders and trees, rising 2 to 3 feet at a time.. Maunsell, who came down this pass, says that the ascent of it must be very difficult. Then a short portion with an easier gradient. At 4 miles 6,620 feefe Up a side valley following a rough track up a series of short zigzags in and out among overhanging trees and jutting pieces of rock. This road is well frequented and is the only way into the Deh Bala Valley, from Charduvar, and presumably vice- versa. At 25J miles, 7,300 feet. Track now r lies along th® ridge of a steep spur. It is a rough narrow r and stony track up a series of short zigzags. At 5 miles, 7,665 feet. This eleva tion was found to be the “ tree limit 55 on the southern slopes of the range. The slopes below that become thickly wooded with oaks, pistachio and hawthorn. Then to the summit, track running parallel to the ridge among slippery rocky strata set up on edge with rises here and there of from 2 feet to 3 from one rocky ledge to another. The summit is reached at 5J miles, and has an elevation of 7,800 feet, or 4,560 feet above Charduvar and 2,835 feet above Deh Bala. From it a fine view r of Deh ,Bala and the adjoining valley is obtained. Maunsell, who crossed from Charduvar to Deh Bala, says that the descent to Deh Bala is much steeper than the ascent from Charduvar, The ascent of 3,700 feet from the Ab-i-Zangavar took him 4|r hours, being a long steady pull, and the descent to Deh Bali took 2 hours. Commence to descend down the first part ofRoute (No£&gt; 46—cowfci the ridge by a narrow 3 to 4 feet track among low brushwood. Track here runs almost north. At 6 miles reach, a coZ from which a fine view is obtainable to the north-west of the Zarneh and Ivan valleys of the Baghdad-Kirmanshah road. Route No. 95. The flat summit of the Manisht Kuh lies to the north-east.' A steep rough track leads down the ravine to the rear towards Ivan. Track very rough and narrow between strata. At 64 fniles, 7,400 feet, track becomes broad and with an easier gra dient. At an elevation of 7,120 feet the tree limit is reached. Above this nothing except low shrubs and a few hawthorn bushes grow. Track skirts a deep V-shaped ravine to the right. At 7J miles, elevation 1,895 feet. Track becomes more stony Immediately on the right is a deep ravine, very rocky and thickly wooded. Its opposite slope is topped by a high cliff. Track broad and good and more level. Then a descent of 130 feet in a short distance. Round the jutting out portion of a small spur. At 84 miles, 6,600 feet. At 9] miles, 6,470 feet, a small spring enough water to fill the hollow of one’s hand when scooped out. A descent of 260 feet to 9f miles by a broad stony track, gradient much steeper. Gradient becomes less steep as descent progresses. Pass some oaks, 3 to 4 feet in diameter, rather stunted in appearance. Thick shrub undergrowth along the hill-side. At 114 miles, 6,120 feet. At this elevation The “ Gavmn,” a low prickly shrub, which was seen at a similar elevation further north in Turkish Kurdistan ceases. Road-now nearly due east. A long stony descent, gradient } to J. The road is broad and winds among the trees. At 124 miles reach the bottom of the pass, 5,780 feet. A deep wooded ravine bordered by crags makes a deep loop to the south-west. Beyond are some steep cliffs. By a stream bed, dry. At 134 miles pass the large spring of Chmi Gutchan, the source of a small stream which the road afterwards follows. A small valley of the same name runs in for a mile to the eastward in which is another sping, and where spine patches of cultivation were seen. Chin or Kinl is the word used for a spring by both Kurds and turs. Following the stream the track is stony and with an easy descending gradient. The valley becomes more confined; a • deep loop runs 2 miles into the south-east lined with wooded crags. Scenery very striking. To the south-east lies a hemispherical Basin topped by a line of cliffs and with theRoute No. 46— contd. lower slopes of shaley spurs very thickly wooded. ^ Track descends along the left side of this. To the west is the fiat summit of theManisht Kuh ? the upper portion being a cliff, 500' to 600' high of grey limestone, and the lower slopes rounded spurs of broken shale thickly wooded with oaks and wild undergrowth. To the east is the Gacha Kuh a line of steep crags and cliffs, cut up in all directions by rocky ravines. The lower slopes are well-wooded. Road follows the stream by a rough track over large round stones. The valley is about 100 yards wide with steep shelving sides. At 14| miles it contracts again and the road enters the Tang-i-Duaman, A email stream runs down it and the road follows its bed among boulders and stones. On either side are cliffs, rising perpen dicular for 200' to 300' of wbitish limestone. The pass is 30 to 40' wide and the road is only a passage 3' to 4' broad between- the boulders. The track is well frequentedj and numerous mule caravans were met about a dozen in each. Donkeys are also much used to carry wheat, rice and dried fruits to Charduvar. From marks on the boulders this stream rises 4' in flood season. This would make the road impass able. The exit of the gorge or rift is well-wooded with large trees and undergrowth. There are several large caves in the cliffs at the exit wliich is reached at 14§ miles. Then by) a good broad track with stony bits here and there. Round the north-west extremity of one of the lower outliers of the Gacha Kuh. Descend a branch valley to the stream by an easy gradient. Ravines are full of boulders and shrub under growth and contain a little water. Some fine oaks, 2 to 3 in diameter, scattered about the slopes. A few pistachio and hawthorn trees also seen. Stream is about 100 yards broad with shelving banks. Then a gradual descent to the Ab-i- Zangavar at 19J miles. Large flocks of sheep and goats were seem The Ab-i-Zangavar is the upper portion of the stream which runs through the Tang-i-Zangavar below Charduvar. The river-bed is composed of large round stones and gravels and is 60 yards wide. The channel in Auust was only 20' wide and some 6' deep, the water being led off into irrigation cuts. A few mud huts were passed but the majority of the people were in booths of branches. Reach the head of the valley with a strip of maize and rice on either bank of the stream, 400 yards broad. Mash, kind of vetch, also in some quantities. Nor Route No. iQ—contd. wheat seems to be grown. Several irrigation channels are crossed on either side of the stream. Wind along the head of some small stony ravines which run towards Zangavan Road still almost due west away from the Manisht Edih. The is dotted with fine oaks, 2' to 3' in diameter, but there is or no undergrowth. Good soil with rich grazing in the earlie portions of the year. The track is a well worn one with easy gradients, up and down several ravines. Still going east reach the highest point of a ridge, 1,475 above Charduvar at 22J miles. From here a good view is obtainable of the Zangavar Valley to the south. A track leads to Zangavar, but it is steep and stony. Road then runs by a broad track diagonally along the rounded summit of the ridge to 23J miles. Then follows a small stony ravine with an easy gradient for J mile. From 24f miles to 25f miles pass an outcrop of sloping sheets of limestone, the track being a succession of steps or stairs for a short distance. Follow an easy track of clay, 10’ to 12 wide, descending the edge of a spur to 26j miles. The ground is cut up in every direction by dry ravines with some stray bushes and shrubs. This is a well-frequented track and the only means of communications between Deh Bala, Zangavar and Gharduvar. This line of low hills is known as the Charmin Kuh. Des cending the spur, reach the Chanareh river at 28 miles. The river is a succession of deep pools with low cliffs on either bank. In high water it looked difficult to find a suitable ford except near Charduvar. Maunseli could not hear of any bridges. The track then keeps along the river following the contours of the projecting spurs, the soil is of clay and loose shale, and the road is rough and cut up by the leakage of a large irrigation channel which runs just above it on the hillside. Several dry ravines were passed from the south. Immediately before entering Charduvar, ford the river. Here several paths come in from the north-west down the valley from Zarneh and Asima- bad, on the Baghdad Kirmanshah road. Route No. 53. The river here was 60 yards wide and 2 / deep, running in a gravelly bed with a rapid stream. There was a good deal of water and more was led away info irrigation cuts. Some of these were HI broad and 8' deep, and were crossed by narrow of three-trunks and fascines. Some rank grass grew along river banks. The spurs of the hills come close to either bank and the river valley is 200 to 300 yards broad. At 30 miles*Route No. 46- Charduvar, a village of 50 huts on the Chanareh river. The villagers had left their houses (August) and were living in booths of branches close by. Along the river bank is an irrigated fringe of maize and rice about J mile wide. 9 PALANGIR direction N.- 4,725' N.-E. Road runs 173i across ^{bare and un- dulating valley to the foot of the \ ardalanyPass. Crossing *01110 low spurs and isolated mounds. The ground slopes gradually down towards the river Chanareh, which shirts the valley on the south after emerging from the Tang-i-Salim. At the bottom of the pass is a small spring, slightly bitter, caused by some gyp sum strata close by. Ascend the steepest portion of the pa*s„ Track very rough. It rises in this portion from 3,ISO' to 5,360'. The southern slope of the range is a curved sheet of rocky strata without a single break except the gully up which the path runs , formed by the erosion of a small stream from the top. The sec tion of this face of tbe range could be pictured by drawing a quarter circle, the circumference being formed of the smooth surface of the strata. The track is steep and difficult, - The hillside is strewn with jagged pieces of rock and boulders and the ascent lies in picking a way up, over or between these, io places there are sudden rises of 3' to 4' and occasionally sheets of the underlying strata have to be crossed. There are small, tracks in every direction, all equally bad. Maunsell cam© down the pass and it took his mules and horses 1| hours to reach the bottom. He says that the ascent would take at least 3 hours. After reaching the 5,360' elevation the track is still steep, but gradually becoming less so. There is a stream bed in the centre of the valley up which the track runs amid boulder* and loose stones with low cliffs on either side. Running up the side of a rocky ravine the broad level summit of the southern portion of the fop-most ridge is reached at 7^ miles, elevation 5,420'. A fine view of the Ab-i-Chanareh, or Ab-i-Karind in the Tang-i-Salim to the left is obtained from here. It flows in a narrow rift with enormous cliffs on either side. Tnesx across the southern portion of the ridge by a broad and easy track giving a gradual ascent over clay soil dotted with tiees. Road here about east. Turn the end of the ridge and go along, the slope to the south-east by a 6' to 8' ledge on the hillsideRoute No.46— among a few trees and unnergrowtIi. Then follow a narrow watershed with a long &lt;iQep walley on either hand at 10 miles and at JOJ miles reach the summit of the pass at elevation of 6,000'. The ridges rise 500 / to 600' higher than this on either side. Descend the south side of the ridge by winding down a small stony ravine and cross an open glade dotted with large trees to 11 miles. Road here is a good track over a clay soil. Plenty of withered branches and firewood. Pass three springs in a ravine here. This is the last water before reaching Mumunai village at 18 miles. Through the upper portion of a well-wooded and undulating vaHey, sloping south-east, and to Ilf miles reach the foot' of a ridge. Ascend by a very rough and stony track, and reach the narrow rocky summit at 12| miles. Elevation b^OlO 7 or a rise of olS 7 from the bottom. Descend again immediately by a series of short zigzags over loose stones among trees; gradient is about 20°. At 134 miles reach a vaHey at the foot, 360 yards broad and thickly wooded with oaks, 18' to 2' in diameter. The valley runs steeply down to the Tang-i-8alim, a glimpse of which can be obtained at the bottom to the north- west. Cross the valley and at 14 miles reach the bottom of another ascent. Ascend diagonally up the hillside by a steep and narrow track which grows worse as progress is made. It lies between large boulders and shrubs. The last 100 yards of the ascent is over sheets of limestone split into large slabs by the action of the weather. Coming down this part the horses had to be very carefully guided. At 14^ miles reach the top of the ridge, elevation 0,640c The summit is a razor-edge. The soil among the boulders is rich. Numerous small shrubs and undergrowth, cover the slopes. The general direction of these ridges is 310 and 130°, Descend from the ridge by a series of short zigzags in and out among boulders and trees. The gradient for the first 400 vards is fhWr» +W loaf onanf oo 0 and the track running among large loose stones and between low trees and shrubs. The track gets less rough and stony towards the bottom which is reached at l$f : miles. Strike across the valley at the foot of the ridge in a direction almost due north. Other tracks lead further up the valley, but are no easier than this. The ridge of the Vardilan Kuh are generally parallehahd fuil south-east and north-eakt. The sizeRqtjte No* of the trees is better higher up the ridge, and a great portion of the firewood for Kirmanshah is brought from here and is mostly used for burning lime. The lower portions of the valley are almost entirely denuded, and the best trees in the most in accessible portions of the ridge. A dry stream bed and a few very small springs are passed in the centre of the valley. The trees are mostly ballut oaks and hawthorn with some pistachio. On along the hillside to 17f miles, where the summit of a ridge is reached. It runs in a direction of 140° and gradually increases it steepness and height. To the south-east are the steep rocky ridges of the Vardalan Kuh, thickly covered with oaks and a low scrub. There is a good view from here of the passage of the Chanareh river through the Vardalan range. After flowing in a valley some 600 yards wide immediately below the track, it makes a sweep to the south-west for 1J miles and then enters the Tang-i-Salim, a series of deep rifts, passsing each ridge of the range in succession and dividing each from top to bottom of the hill. On either side are a series of steep wooded slopes and huge rocky precipices. A path leads through it, said to be unfit for mules. Before entering the pass is a belt of irrigated Indian- corn and rice crops about 500 yards wide, irrigated by canals along the banks. Winding round the end of the steep rocky ridge on the right of the road, which is narrow', turns sharply from its previous north-east direction and emerges into a small valley running north-west. At 18 miles pass Mumunai village in the centre of the valley. It contains 50 huts surrounded by a small orchard and patches of cultivation. A shallow pond lies close by with numerous springs bubbling up through the gravelly bottom. Road now' gets broader. At 19J miles reach a ridge at the head of the valley. The Chanareh river breaks through the ridge in a narrow gorge 1 mile, to the left. On the overhanging cliff is the Ziarat of Hamazadeh, a conical-shaped tomb surrounded by a thick grove of oaks. Two other similar shaped tombs lie in the yalley to the south. This ridge is reached by a good easy track ascending up a small ravine. This ridge is the last outlying portion of the Vardalan Kuh on this side. Descend from the low ridge and at 19f miles enter the fertile valley of Harassan. At 20f miles cross a small stream in the centre of the valley by Barika, a small village of some 50 mud huts on its right bank. The stream was almost dry, the water being led away in small channels for irrigation. The village ofRoute No. 46- Harassan lies 3 mile's.'up the valley to the east. . It is a place of 150 houses clustered round a mud fort and surrounded by orchards. The valley is fertile and well-watered from a large spring near the village. The valley is shut in by a low range of rocky hills, 1 mile east of the vilage. This is the limit of Hasand Agha/s property. Over the hills to the east is Hululan, one day distant. Ascend out of the valley over a series of mounds and another low spur at 22miles and cross the head of the fertile val ley of Gurravan, extending on either bank of the Chanareh river. It runs about 4 miles to the soiith-east and is not culti vated. At 24| miles ascend over a spur. The road, especially the ascent, is rough and over jagged ledges of soft white rock. By taking the main valley from Palangir along the stream bank this ridge might be avoided. At 24 miles reach the top of the ridge, a low stony spur from the range to the eastward. Then to Palangir, across the foot of a side valley running east. Road good, 30' broad, over clay and gravel soil, skirting numerous irrigation channels watering the maize crops in the valley. At 27 miles Palangir, a village of 100 houses and near it is a small orchard and vineyard and some fields of hemp and sesame. The wheat in August had been harvested, but the Indian-com was just ripe. A large stream runs down the valley. It com mences at Sham and numerous springs increase it after leaving that place. This and the other villages in this vicinity are the property of Hasan Agha of Kirmanshah. Numerous flocks of sheep and cattle were seen grazing on the hillsides. The head man of the village owns 40 fine mu!es : This district breeds mules in considerable numbers. On the opposite side of the v m a west of which is a wide valley running north-north-west, 4 or 5 miles broad and 20 to 30 miles long, down which flows a large stream.

At 3 miles pass Maidassar, a village of 30 houses at the foot of the range bounding the valley on the west. On the crest of the hill above is a ziarat in a grove of fine oak trees. These trees are considered sacred and are never cut or lopped. They show the possibility of planting all these bare hills. Half mile to the south of the village the ridge ends abruptly and at its end is situated a cluster of springs with a large supply of water. This, and the water from the stream from the Sham spring, affords an abundant supply for irrigating the valley. Large crops of Indian-com were grown in irrigated patches along the stream bank. They weie just ripening in August. Bus or the liquorice plant also grows wild here. Gross the lower portion of a side valley running east for a short distance, and reach 5 miles. The main valley on the left is 1 mile broad and at the foot of a rocky ridge on the west side is the village of Hamarra containing 150 mud huts.

To the north-west runs a valley, 2 to 3 miles broad, bounded by low ridges and extending up to some 10 miles in a north-westerly direction. At 7 miles pass a small mound, | mile to the east, crowned by the ruins of a square mud fort. It was formerly a position of some importance. The mound stands at the foot of some stony spurs from the low rounded range bounding the valley in that direction. A village of some 40 mud huts, called Shani, lies just behind the mound. •&gt; A good deal of wheat and barley cultivation in the valley. Then through the Shani valley. The road inclines away from the east side. Soil is a fertile clay and gravel. The valley is level and well-cultivated and is 1J miles wide. The water from the stream is led into numerous irrigation channels. The stream bed is called the Chashma-i-Shani. At 8| miles pass through an orchard of apricot trees with two mills. Follow the right bank of the stream. Pass several large springs of good water in the stream bed. At 9 miles through the Tang-i-Shanx, a narrow defile with steep rocky sides, some 300 yards long and 30 yards broad. The road follows the stream bed among stones and boulders and is rough going. Then turn sharp round the end of a ridge bounding the .south side of a valley. The ridge is218 . Route- steep and covered with low shrubs. It runs parallel to the Lanavan Kuh. Follow' a stream bed almost dry and lined with a few shrubs. Then strike diagonally across the valley and follow the northern side of the valley, which here is 500 yards wide for | mile to 11 miles. The track is a broad road of 30 ' with a gentle ascent. At 11| miles pass the village of Anjirak, a cluster of 40 mud huts, situated near a spring with a plentiful supply of water, at the foot of an ascent. Ascend to the edge of an abrupt dip of the valley caused by an outcrop of horizontal strata of hard white limestone. The first part of the ascent, for | mile, is by zigzags among boulders and large loose stones ; track stony and difficult. Then over sheets and slabs of rock in places gradient steep and track bad. Rocky ravines lie on either hand. Ats 12 miles reach the edge of the dip, having ascended 230 from Anjirak. Then by a gentle ascent across the Kilandasht valley.

It runs in a deep ravine with high clay sides, 80' deep, the descent and ascent being a rough 4' ledge in the slope. The water is slightly Iwackish. Cross to the left bank. Road crosses the wide undulating plain, stretching to the south-west of the Tang-i- Gunjan Cham. This plain is known by various names, the up])*‘r portion being known as the Gusdana, and the lower as the Bahnravan plain. The soil here is a light clay, through which numerous beds of gypsum appear. Water in the streams brackish (August). In the spring on this plain and the low hills which border it grow plenty of short grass and are full of encampments of Lurs who graze their flocks here. At this time of year it is bare and burnt up, and the glare was severe while travelling over these white roads and dazzling sheets of gypsum. When the mountain streams are full, the water on this plain is good, but at this time most of the streams are bitter or brackish. At 15J miles road is a broad gravelly track under the foot of a low rounded hill on the right. Commence the ascent to the Karrapi plateau, the track keeping to the right side of the valley skirting the stream which cuts its way in the soft clay in a narrow ravine, 50' to 60' deep with perpendicular sides of clay. This is the lowest spur of the .range. A few tamarisk bushes or thin fringe of reeds by the stream banks is all the vegetation which can be seen. At 15f miles the worst part of the ascent is commenced. Up to this the valley was J mile wide with undula ting clay hills on either side. Descend the spur on the south side to the stream valley at 16 miles, the road follows the edge of a deep narrow ravine 20' wide and 100' deep in which the stream runs. Up the valley through low shrubs and reeds lining the river bank into the Tang-i-Ghulam. The entrance is by a small valley 150 to 200 yards with shelving sides bordered by rugged cliffs at the summit. The defile is 200 yards long and closes in to 20'wide with limestone cliffs, 200' high on either hand. The gradient is not so steep, but the path is obstructed by ■ enormous boulders and loose rounded stones. A small stream runs through the pass containing 1' of water in August. The track passes through the water, so that in the spring the road would be impassable. After the pass ascend to the end of a spur reached at 17 miles. The ascent is by a series of zigzags out of a narrow ravine, barely 40 yards wide.

The spur is narrow with a deep ravine on either hand, bordered by steep slopes of clay and rock with an occasional low tree or bush. Track gradually descends by a valley converging into the deep ravine down to the left which further on becomes the Kuh-i- Sultan defile which the track is approaching. Enter the Kuh4- Sultan defile, by which name the narrow part of the ravine m&gt; known. It is 400 yards long, and the track winds between large boulders and loose jagged pieces of rock. The track is- narrow and there are sudden rises from one rocky ledge to another. The ravine is V-shaped and the gradient is J to 7 . Out of the defile at 19 miles and on up the ravine. The valley winds a good deal but gets broader as the ascent continues. The rocks grow less and the masses of limestone strata; cease to appear ; the track is narrow, about 4'. to 6' broad, and revetted on the outside by branches kept in position by large stones. Then up by a broad track in the shale of the centre of the ravine. The sides are dotted with a few trees and shrubs. Reach the elevation 1 of 4,215'. Then by an easy descending gradient skirting the southern side of the ravine. The slopes are loose disintegrated shales. The track is a 4' to 6' ledge worn in the side of the spur. Strike diagonally across a spur to the right and skirt the northern side of a ravine, elevation 4,735'. The hillside is much cut up; with deep ravines choked with boulders. Up a ravine with an easy gradient. The track is covered with loose jagged stones and winds between broken slabs of rock. Continue ascend to the plateau the direction in the last mile changing from north to east. The KarrapI plateau, 5,295', consists of the ridge of a long flat spur from the main range forming a sort of upper plateau. It is some 800 yards wide with a rich black soil,, cultivated with wheat in small patches. The crops had been harvested in August.

This is the outer ridge of the Pusht-i Kuh, the hills lying belov^ being small spurs and off-shoots of this* The Tigris and the plains are visible in the distance. Gradua descent by a broad track, 15' to 20 7 wide, through a thickly wooded country to 2J miles. Track runs nearly east along the hillside diagonally. At 3 J miles pass a spring with a copious supply of sweet water emerging from the hillside near a grove of oaks. It is in a circular basin in the hillside, 1^ miles in diameter and surrounded by cliffs^ 50' to 100 7 high. The stream runs down the valley to the south-east, towards Gunjan Cham. The valley in which this river runs can be traced from its source in the northern end of the Kabir Kuh winding through several gorges and traversing a very rough wild country. To the north-west a glimpse can be obtained of the small plain of Atash, shut in between high ridges. This is on the banks of the stream from the Deh Bala plain which passes through these ridges by a series of deep gorges. These are the head of waters of the Ab-i-Tursakh.

It is 4 7 to 6 7 wide and has an easy gradient. A deep wooded ravine lies at the foot of the slope to the right. The country to the south-east is very rough, crossed by several wooded ridges divided by deep craggy ravines, generally parallel ;and running north-west to south-east. It extends to the foot of the Kabir Kuh and also to the northward for some ^.distance. These ravines to the right drain into the head watersRoute No. 46 — contd. of the Gunjan Cham river. The top of the ridge, 5,380', is reached at 8 miles. Descend steeply again down a broad track over clay and disintegrated rock. The trees are ballut oak, pista chio and hawthorn. Reach a narrow valley b etween two parallel ridges ; ground much cut up with small ravines and choked with undergrowth and trees. There is a dry stream bed in the valley. At 8J miles ascend again following a small wooded ravine by a narrow stony track. At 9| miles round the southern end of the ridge. At 10J miles a fine view of the north-west extremity of the Kabir Kuh, 20 miles to the east bearing 118° is obtained. It is well wooded and slightly higher than the Manisht Kuh. It is divided from the Gatcha Kuh by a series of rugged ravines and valleys, all of them looking of a very impass able nature. Here turn sharp over the ridge by a stony spur and descend steeply over clay and disintegrated rock. Then a gradual descent over the lower spurs of the wooded range to the south-east of the Deh Bala valley by a broad track among stunted oaks. From 10| miles to 13f miles road runs almost north up a side valley, crossing some small ravines. Soil is of a poor clay and gravelly, covered with a little scrub. At 13| miles pass a curious conical hill called Kaleh Kairan, 2 miles to the north-west on the edge of the valley. The top is flat and 400 yards in diameter scarped by perpendicular limestone cliffs. On the south-east side for a short distance the cliffs disappear in a steep rugged slope up which is a bridle path. There is no building on the top, but it is used as a place of refuge by the neighbouring tribes. It cannot be commanded from any of the neighbouring heights. Then cross the valley, some 1| miles broad and 6 miles long to Deh Bala. Track slightly as cending. The valley is well cultivated with irrigated crops of For Deh Bala see main route. maize.

In August 1916 the road was stated to have been put in good order and to have been used by an Ambanah. # • i Water .—From Badrah to Tursak (25 miles) no water on the road but about midway a good track branches off to the hills, where at Bagh Hassan (distant 1J hours from the main road) is a large stream of slightly brackish water. q At Tursak the water is brackish. Probably plentiful but no information available on this point. From Tursak to Manclali the best road is that near the hills. . \ to Three hours u B. from Tursak and half an hour east of the road is 10 J miles Chagha Lajama where brackish wat ^r can be had from stream ten feet wide and two feet deep.

From Gulgul the road descends to the valley of the Samiarreh river and is more difficult, traversing passes barely practicable for laden . animals. On reaching Budbar (stage 7) the Saimarreh river must be forded; it is practicable for laden animals only from July to October. From Budbar to the junction with Boute No. 46 the Kirmanshah- Kut-al-Amarah road, the road is good with the exception of the section up the Zangavar valley , stage 10, and is easily improvable to a state traversable by artillery. The spring is indicated as the best season for the passage of troops. Cavalry could traverse this route with ease and rapidity owing to the abundance of forage.

ABU ARUJ 14 &gt;1 TIJOl dll 14 , country through which the road ru^f^at bht inter^ersed with moimcls, which are seldom more than 15 feet above the surrounding country, and ha% gently sloping sides, They form no red obstacle to the movements of men, horses or even carts but they afford cover from view or fire to a considerable distance in rear of theni. The first mounds of this kind are met with at a distance of 3 to 4 miles, from Baghdad in a north-easterly direction. Three or four miles further on a different .sort of mounds is encountered, the silted up remains of old can a s running generally north by west to south py east. There are two or three such embankments running parallel : to each other, and varying in height from fifteen to dve feet, and m breadth from forty to ten feet. For the first 8 miles the soil is light clay, but as the river is approached, the soil becomes more , sandy. In dry weather carts and animals can move. over this country in almost any direction with ease, but even a little rain proves a Serious obstacle, for then the soil becomes first slippery arid then sticky and quaggy. After an inch or rain this-country is difficult, even for footmen, to traverse, and after a heavy fall it would generally be impassable for at least 24-.hours after the ground began to dry. The Dialah at the boat ferry has steep banks, in many places precipitous : and is about sixty yards wide. The depth varies according to the season, and varies considerably, from, about fifteen to two feet. The ferry consists of a light boat, of rectangular or punt shape, about 30 feet long by ten feet wide, one end of which is opened and nearly flush with the bank, and at thisRoute Ho. 83—contd. end embarkation and disembarkation take pladiF-A slack hemp rope is stretched from bank to bank, and moored to wooden- pegs let into the banks. Along this rope the ferry boat ir hauled by men inside the boat; two men suffice for this unless the wind is unusually strong and directly up and down stream when more labour would be required. The boat can carry eight horses at a time and a proportionate number of mules ; or other animals ; the sides of the boats are only about three- feet above the water, and if the animals are restive there is some danger of their jumping out of their boat, or patting their feet through the sides which are lightly built of laths laced between timbers of about four to six inches in diameter,, which form the ribs of the boat. The outside of the boat is or bitumen very commonly used m W? neighbourhood, and is the only protection against leak- age, but it appears to be sufficient. The boat is furnished with a long rudder built out of a framework of light timber. The rudder makes a powerful lever and the boat is propor tionately handy. The current of the river varies according to the season from four miles an hour, after a rise, to an almost imperceptible flow during the dry season. The banks of the river are steep even at the ferry, but it is not necessary to* unload animals laden with ordinary weights. On the far, or left bank, there is within fifty feet of the top, the remains ot an old canal which seems to have taken off from the Dialaffi a ns point. The canal is silted up, but it is about twenty feet wide and about ten feet high. Abu Aruj is a little north r about one mile of the ruins marked as Safrl on most maps, but the Arabs m the neighbourhood never seem to have heard ot this name. No information concerning supplies, etc. 2 SANNIYEH —General direction! north-easterly. The , i , . nature of the soil is f. ® .i 88 ? 1 ^ c a y&gt; hut this side of the Dialah is much greenen an a on t e Baghdad side. There is a certain amount of spasmodic cultivation in some of the hollows where rain water has collected, but it is not annual. There are one or wo encampments of Arabs which wander over the plain, halting at different places where there is water until it is finished. The country is featureless and flat, with a few moundsKoute No. 53 — contd. at intervals. During winter season this portion of the deserfe is dotted with shallow lakes of water, and it is not possible to move in a straight line in any direction for more than three or four miles at a stretch. These lakes are merely collections of rain water in depressions of the ground, and do not generally exceed three feet in depth. There are no reeds or grass in these lakes and no cover of any kind on or near them. During the winter, grass is very abundant but very short, and in the* hot season the water and grass disappear, and the place be comes a burning desert of dust. There is a certain amount of fertile land at Sanniyeh which is the property of the Sultan. This place is not marked on the map and there is no mention of what the water-supply, etc., is. The distance of the march also is not given, and so the total distance, as measured on the map, between Abu Aruj and Baiadruz, namely, 32 miles, has been divided between the two stages. 3 BALADRUZ 16.—General direction north-easterly. For 46 the first 12 miles of this march the country is exactly the same as before, but on nearing Baiadruz it becomes lower and marshy. During or soon after rain this country must be quite impassable. At two or three miles from Baiadruz a few irrigation channels are met with, but they are not a serious obstacle even to carts. The main canal from the north, however, known as the Baia druz canal is about 8 feet deep and about 20 feet vide, and when full is a complete obstacle to all progress except at very few places where it is bridged. There are only three such places in the neighbourhood of Baiadruz and one bridge (about four miles north of Baiadruz) only consists of two palm trees thrown across, with some dust and mud spread over them. The other bridges are one of brick and one of wood in the village of Baiadruz itself. The brick bridge leads into and is part of a farm belonging to a Constantinople Greek, named Zarifi. This brick bridge is about ten feet wide and strong enough for field artillery or ordinary carts. It leads into the farmyard, from which there is a road with an exit to right and left, on the opposite side of the bridge, the farm houses and buildings are of brick and consist of four courtyards lead ing by narrow passages into one another. Baiadruz is thickly * B252 Route No. 53 — contd. wooded and consists largely of date gardens and fruit orchards. All these gardens and orchards are enclosed by walls, about a foot and half thick and about ten feet high. Each enclosure ihas one or two narrow doors. The bazaar consists of one street and is insignificant; the lanes between the gardens are about 12 feet wide and very filthy ; they are nearly all rectangular. The wooden bridge over the canal in the centre of the village is a frail structure of wood, fit for loaded mules and perhaps camels, but hardly for anything heavier. It is about four feet wide and is supported in the centre by a brick column. There is not a single tree or bush between Baghdad and Man- dali except at Baladruz, and the country, with the exception of the few mounds and canals already noted, is nearly as flat as a table. 4 MANDALl 27.—General direction E. by X. Leaving the 73 gardens the route starts over a broad clay track through grassy fields skirting an irrigation cut. For 2 miles the only road leads through a reedy marsh with from eighteen inches to two feet of water ; the bottom is fairly firm going, but in places there are deep muddy cuts into which the animals sink. The track is cleared of reeds and there is no chance of missing it in the water. The marsh is said to be dry or nearly so in the summer months, but, according to Hubbard, was under 2 feet 6 inches of water in April and was said to have been up to the level of a man’s chin a short time previously. This portion of the route must therefore be completely blocked at certain times in the spring as the water stretches for some miles on each side. By making a detour of some miles to the south, the marshy part to be crossed is said to be less, but the route described seems to be the regular caravan route. At 4f miles, the marsh being left, the plain is regained, in the hollows of which there is an abund ance pf short green grass. At 12f miles a small stream with an occasional pool of sweet water is reached. The ground slopes down gently from here to Mandall. At 18 miles the Halt river is reached, a sluggish stream 20 to 25 yards wide and 6 feet deep with steep earth banks lined with reeds and tamarisk scrub. In the hot weather the water is not only unpleasantly flavoured with petroleum but is unwholesomeRoute No. 5$—contd. to drink, causing diarrhoea. The banks of the Naft are at present impassable for carts but ramps could easily be made, for the soil is a soft red sandy loam. At 20f miles the ford over the river is reached, which is some 40 yards wide and 2 feet deep, with easy approaches. The bottom is muddy. At 22| miles the large tomb of Nubi Tehran, or Imam ’Abdullah, is passed on a mound a mile and half to the south ; a stream flows midway between it and the road. There are several springs and streams passed in this dip, all brackish and unfit to drink, and the ground is thickly covered with saline in crustations. The only form of vegetation is a few low bushes. At 24f miles a few scattered fields of barley are reached as the town is approached. At 27 miles is the village of Mandali situated in a large patch of date gardens. It is surrounded by trees in walled gardens. The trees and garden enclosures are of the same kind as in Baladruz but far more extensive. The houses are built largely of mud or sun-dried bricks and the enclosure walls are in nearly every case built of mud. Mandali is on ground sloping to the southward, and is amply supplied with good water which is brought by a canal taken off from the Gangir river at a distance of about three miles to the north-east of the town. This canal divides into three branches of which one turns northwards without entering the town and is lost in the desert about six miles to the north of Mandali. This branch is almost parallel to the branch from Kifri. The other two branches pass through the town and bifurcate in various directions on the way. The supplies available at Mandali are of the same kind as those available at Baladruz but about treble the quantity. There is ample water in the Gangir river all the year round. The stream is very rapid near Mandali, about five miles an hour, and the water is about 2| feet deep and 60 feet wide at the end of February. The banks are gently shelving and the bottom is pebbly. At the time when the snows have begun to melt the stream is probably much larger. 5 MU AR ANN A CAMP 251.—General direction north-easterly. The 98| road at first runs through the narrow street and date gardens between high mud walls, and crossing several small irrigation channels254 Route No. 53 — contd. emerges on to the plain and follows the edge of the enclosures. At 1 mile the date groves are cleared, and the road crosses a wide grassy plain leading towards a gap in the range in front. At 2f miles two irrigation channels are crossed, 6 feet wide and 2 feet deep, watering the Mandall gardens and coming from a dam on the Gangir near the Tang-i-Sunmar. Four- small date plantations with tombs are dotted alongside this- canal; there are also several mills, and the banks are lined' for a short distance with barley crops. The clay soil of the plain ends here and the ground becomes stonier and rougher. At 3| miles, the Rud-Khaneh-i-Gangir, or the Ab-i-Ravan, lies 500 yards to the south running in a wide gravel bed along several small channels. The road crosses some low undula tions. At 4} : miles the route lies alongside the bed of the river, here 400 yards wide. The water is brackish and the banks quite bare of vegetation. On the left bank are some low sandstone cliffs. At 4| miles the frontier is marked by a pile of stones standing just at the mouth of the valley through which the road runs. The road is a good thirty-foot track, over red sandstone and gravelly conglomerate. This open defile where the river debouches into the plain is known as the Tang-i-Sunmar. At 5 miles the road continues up the valley here about one mile wide, bordered by low undulating hills. A small and very brackish stream enters on the left bank from the direction of Jabal Atish. Naphtha springs lie in that direction. The river here winds considerably and at six miles the main channel is forded, 40 yards wide and two feet deep, with a rapid current and numerous side channels. The total width of the river bed is some 400 yards. The bed- consists of large loose stones and gravel, and the going is rather rough. On the left bank is a small spring of sweet water ; the river is still brackish. The road continues to skirt the left bank; an easy broad track, though somewhat stony in places. From 8.y miles to 10 miles the road gradually ascends up a valley three miles broad, bounded by barren rounded gravelly hills. There is a little grass with an occasional tamarisk or oleander. The river bed is lined with tall sedges and reeds. A lOf miles there is a good track 10 to 12 feet broad over gravelly soil, crossing some low undulations and spurs from the range to the south-east. At 11J miles the river bed is half a mile wide with some patches of good grass;255 Route No. 53—contd. on the right bank. At Ilf miles, on the opposite bank, is the tomb of Imam-i-Suninar, or Kaleh Sunmar, on some gravelly mounds on which are several upright stones. There is a tumulus, called Kaleh Sunmar, some 80 feet high and 300 yards in diameter. The road crosses numerous spurs from the hills to the south-east now 300 to 400 yards distant. The soil is stony and covered with patches of grass. The valley narrows down to one mile wide. The river is rapid flowing over a stony bed a quarter of a mile wide. At 14| miles the road winds round the foot of a steep spur ; the hillside is strewn with conglomerate boulders. At 16| miles a sandstone ridge is crossed extending across the valley and forming a cliff some 40 feet high on the northern slope. By making a detour of a quarter of a mile to the eastwards, an easy place to de scend is found passing over ledges of soft friable sandstone and between boulders. An easy carriage road could be cleared over this in a short time. At 17 miles there are several springs of good water, surrounded by patches of luxuriant grass. The track is good but somewhat stony in places. At 17f miles the road crosses a small rounded ridge on the crest of which commanding the road are the ruins of an old square fort, known as the Kaleh Dabrul Khan, the outline of which is now visible ; the river runs in a bed, 400 yards wide, a quarter of a mile to the eastward. On the right bank are some gypsum and chalky cliffs overhanging the water and on the left gravelly cliffs 80 to 100 feet high. From here the road descends a short‘steep skqDe, over an easy track amongst conglonerate boulders opening out to view the Vurgatch Valley, half a mile broad, bordered to the south-east by a steep range of the same name. At 18 miles at the foot of the incline the Gulail Mulishi stream is crossed, 10 yards broad and 2 feet deep, coming from the Kuh-i-Kaleh-i-Baghdad, to the south-east. Its waters are brackish and undrinkable. Above this point the river water is sweet. The hills on either side are quite bare. At 20J miles some ruins, known as Nala Shaikhuna, are passed close to the river at the foot of a low spur from the right. The valley here narrows to 400 yards. At 21 miles the road de scends a sandstone ledge crossing the valley by a rocky rough descent for 50 yards; by clearing some of the rough places a good cart road could be made. At the foot of the descent another valley opens out, 600 yards wide. The border hills256 Route No. 53 — contd. become more precipitous and rugged and gradually increase in height as we ascend. The river-bed now is 80 to 100 yards wide and is a deep rapid torrent. It runs between cliffs of white limestone 25 to 30 feet high, and the bed is filled with reeds and oleander shrubs. At 21 J miles the ruins of the old bridge of Pul-i-Surufsha is passed, the greater part of which has been swept away. At 22f miles the Gangir river is forded again about a quarter of a mile above the old bridge ; the river is thirty yards broad and two and a half feet deep with a rapid stream over a gravelly bed, making a difficult ford. A steep cliff comes close to the left bank and necessitates this ford being made. At 23f miles the road is a rough narrow track closely overhanging the bank. The valley is 300 to 400 yards wide and the river winds from side to side of it. Several steep narrow valleys parallel to each other come in on the left bank. The ridges on either bank become higher and more rugged as the road ascends. At 24J miles the road is running up a narrow valley by a narrow track over large stones and round some jagged spurs from the hills to the north-west. At 24| miles the river is skirted flowing in a deep bed bordered by cliffs 100 feet high. In the valley there is a splendid grass and a few patches of Indian corn are cultivated. At 251 mile the Gangir is forded for the third time. The ford is 30 yards wide and 2 feet deep, with a gravelly bottom and easily shelv ing banks. The track is stony and little used. At 251- miles the encamping ground on the river bank is reached. There are no villages to be seen in the neighbourhood. This is a camping ground for the Karind Turks in the summer.

The road leads 114J up the valley crossing several ravines and clay undulations covered with rich grass. At f mile the river is bordered by cliffs 40 feet high of white chalky rock and conglomerate. At 1 mile the road descends steeply through an opening in the cliff into the river-bed. This avoids a spur which juts out from the right. The track in the river-bed is rough and obstructed by oleander bushes andRoute No. 53 — contd. reeds, along the foot of the cliffs. The valley is 300 yards wide, bordered by steep bare ridges 400 to 600 feet high, the river flowing along the western side. A little cutting in the soft shale of the hillside would enable the road to be carried round the spur. At 1J miles the road ascends a small gravelly ravine out of the river-bed and reaches a grassy terrace which borders it, and then runs round the foot of several spurs, the extremities of the range forming the Tulvar-i-Khuda range, a series of rocky impassable ridges running parallel to each other, and rising 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the valley. At 2| miles the river is running in a deep bed 40 to 50 yards wide bordered by gravelly cliffs 80 feet high; the valley is 200 to 300 yards wide and is formed of a series of flat grassy terraces at the foot of the hills on either bank. The road keeps along the terrace on the left bank. The rock is a hard grey lime stone. At 3J miles the road runs round the foot of a steep rocky spur which abuts here on the stream. This is the extremity of the highest ridge of the Tulvar-i-Khuda. The track is stony but easy. At 3J miles are the ruins of a bridge called the Dukhtar-i-Kurd. A few wild figs are to be seen on the hillside, and good grass covers the slopes. At 4J miles the road runs through the Diz Giran valley, by a broad and easy track along the terrace running by the north side of the valley underneath a rocky cliff 100 feet high. The valley here is three-quai’ters of a mile broad, and the border hills are very rugged and steep. At 5 miles the valley is a quarter of a miie wide, and the road is good with a very gradual ascent. On the right bank are steep cliffs. At 6 miles the valley widens from one to one and a half miles, the river winding down the centre. It is six miles long running in an east-north easterly direction. On either side are low shaley spurs from the steep ranges further back with numerous small valleys and streamlets which flow into the river. The upper portion of the valley is known as the Ziarat and the lower as the Diz Giran valley. At 7J miles an undulating valley is entered half a mile broad bounded on the south-west by one of the ridges of # the Tulvar-i-Khuda range ; a few shrubs and wild fig trees are to be seen. At 7J miles a steep rocky spur is passed the prolongation of a ridge from the south-east which here juts across the valley and causes the river to make a sharp bend; the end of the ridge forms a steep cliff •overhanging258 Route No. 53 — contd. the river-bed. The track ascends a side valley for a short distance and then turns up over the ridge following a steep ascent for 300 yards, by a series of short zig-zags. At 8 } miles the road descends into the river valley and again reaches a Wide grassy terrace overlooking the river-bed. A cutting in the soft shale round the extremity of the ridge would make this into a good cart road. At 9J miles the hills on the left bank overhang the river, the strata forming nearly vertical sheets. For 500 yards the track, a one to two foot ledge, takes advantage of the broken parts of these strata. In places it has been helped by revetments of bushes and stones. The river is not fordable here or this bad portion might be avoided. The rock is soft shale and a cutting could be made with little difficulty. At IO 4 miles the valley makes a bend to the north east, and river forces its way through a gorge, known as the Tang-i-Shutar Gardan. The passage is only 30 to 40 yards wide bordered by steep limestone cliffs 150 feet high, at the bottom of which rushes a foaming torrent. The road is a broad track closely overlooking the cliff along the left bank. The remains of an old bridge and some buildings, said to have been a customs bar, are situated in the pass. The river gorge is three-quarters of a mile long, and after that the valley again widens. At 11 J miles the track descends by a series of easy zig-zags into the river-bed, and the river is forded for the fourth time, by a ford 40 yards wide and 2 feet deep, over a rough rocky bed in a rapid stream ; the approaches on either bank are easy. The ascent on the right bank is a steep but easy track, 6 feet to 8 feet wide up some shelving rocky strata. The valley now becomes narrower and V-shaped. This is the Sambak valley. At Ilf miles the road turns sharp to the right up a side valley. Tam valley is 50 to 60 yards wide and on the south-west side abuts a steep ridge ending in a crumbling rocky cliff 500 feet high along the foot of which a small stream winds. The track follows the stream bed. At 124 miles the valley gradually opens out into a wide undulating plain with several side valleys. It is bordered by rocky ridges covered with shrubs and trees, rising 600 to 700 feet above it. The plain rises gently to the north and the road continues up the centre of it. The stream in it is crossed four times; 10 yards wide and one foot deep, bordered by sedges and shrubs. Sonle signs of irrigation and a few patches of Indian259 Route No. 53— corn are to be seen. At 15| miles the camping ground of Oham-i-Surkh is reached in the centre of the valley on the stream bank. Water .—Good from the stream. Fodder—Grazing excellent. Supplies. — Nil, with the exception of sheep and goats that could be purchased from the nomads in large numbers. 7 ZARNEH VALLEY 20 J.—General direction south-easterly. The 1341 road follows a broad track up the centre of the valley inclining towards the north east and gradually ascending. There are several small springs in the hill sides, and the water-supply is good and abundant. The border hills are of a white limestone. On the west of the plain is a curious isolated hill called the Kaleh-i-Markara, the top of the hill being crowned by a cliff 60 feet high, and the ruins of an old fort. At 1J miles the road winds round the foot of a spur from the range to the east here, called the Bagh Kuh. The soil is a hard gravelly earth, with large stones and boulders ; the lower slopes are dotted with shrubs and stunted ilex and oaks. At 3 miles the road turns up through the Tang-i-Khushk, and ascends a gentle slope up a valley, in which the track is good with a few scattered stones. The Gllan Kuh is a steep rocky ridge bounding the valley to the north-west and lies immediately to the left. The pass is a deep gap between this and the Bagh Kuh, both ridges ending in terraced bluffs overlooking the road. At the foot of the pass, at 3f miles, the gradient is 5°, and the valley is 60 to 80 yards broad with a small stream. There is now a gradual ascent up the valley bordered in places by cliffs 30 to 40 feet high. The road is stony but fairly easy going, winding among the trees and boulders. At 4J miles a craggy cliff, 400 feet high, overhangs the road 200 yards to the left; this is the end of the Gilan Kuh. At 4| miles there is a short ascent for 30 yards, by a series of short zig-zags over loose stones and between trees. This continues to the summit of the pass. The ascent is gradual the whole of the way, and if the track was cleared of some of the boulders and the gradient lessened for some of the way near the summit by zig-zags, a good cart road could be made. It is passable for artillery in its present condi260 Route No. 53 — contd. tion. At 5 miles the summit of the pass is reached at an eleva tion of 1,875 feet above the Cham-i-Surkh plain. Immediately below to the north-east lies a deep narrow valley running down towards the Gungir. The road from the summit keeps along that side of this valley and is rough and narrow; in places it is only an eight to a five foot ledge. The soil is rich clay covered with grass. To the left is the Gilan Kuh ending in a series of terraced bluffs. Several ravines run towards the valley to the right, and the opposite slope is thickly wooded, with some steep limestone cliffs near the summit. At 7 miles the route lies down a series of sharp zig-zags over loose jagged stones fallen from the cliffs above. The dry bed of a stream in the valley is reached, after about 200 yards of difficult going. At 7-j- miles the road takes a sharp bend through the lower pass, also known as the Tang-i-Khushk. The pass is a rift in the mountain range, from 30 to 40 yards wide, the total length being 1,300 yards, bordered by precipitous cliffs of grey limestone the strata of which run nearly horizontally. The road is rough and stony, but some parts have been im proved by laying down branches with earth and stones on top, but in the spring a torrent sweeps down the centre. It is level throughout and for the last three hundred yards the track lies in the dry bed of the torrent. There are several caves at the northern mouth of the pass. At 7|- miles the road opens out into a narrow valley with steep stony sides on either hand. At 8 miles the road emerges into the Mindar valley, running north-west in th edirection of Gilan, and south east in the direction of Zarneh. It is here one and a half miles wide and gently sloping up from the centre in a series of rounded grassy ridges dotted with fine trees like an English park. The road bifurcates here, one branch running down to Gilan and Qasr-i-Shirin (see Route No. 57). At 9| miles the road is a broad track over light gravelly soil. At 10| miles the summit of a long gradual ascent is reached. This ridge forms the watershed of the Gilan and Zarneh valleys. At II miles the road passes several ruins and scattered stones making the site of a place called Karan. The trees gradually disappear as the descent is made and the Zarneh plain itself is quite bare. At 20J miles the camping ground near the ruins of old Zarneh is reached. Supplies may be procurable from nomads.261 Route No. 53—con^. 8 CHARMILLA CAMP 13^.—General direction N. —_ E. The road follows 147f a broad track down the centre of the valley, over gravelly soil, where the going is easy. It slopes gradually towards the centre, and numerous small streams are passed flowing towards Zarneh ; these join the head waters of the Gangir. At 1J miles some ruins are passed situated by a fine spring; on the west side of the valley, here four miles wide, are a series of deep wooded ravines and ridges. The Gangir flows through a long narrow gorge in these hills called the Tang-i-Aiwan and emerges into the Jam Sambak valley where the road leaves it. At 4f miles the ruins of the village of Zarneh are passed on a large tumulus in the plain a few of the houses still being standing, but mostly in ruins. The country is deserted except by the Kalhur Kurd nomads who come here in the summer months and retire to the plains of Zuhab for the winter. The tumulus on which Zarneh stands is 200 yards in diameter, and rises 100 feet out of the plain. Just north of it lies a large spring called the Chashmeh-i-Zarneh from which a large stream of excellent water issues. The plain grov/s good grass. The nomads send men directly the snow is off the ground to sow patches of Indian corn which they reap when they arrive later on. Numerous other smaller springs are passed and water is abund ant at all times of the year. At the southern end of the plain is Manisht Kuh, At 5f miles Zarneh plain is left and the road turns up through a pass in the ridge bordering it on the east. The pass is thirty to forty feet wide bordered by steep grassy slopes dotted with a few trees and topped by steep rugged cliffs. The track is level, but the going is rough owing to loose stones which might easily be cleared away. At 16J miles the pass wddens to 200 yards but the going is still rough over loose stones, the cliffs to the left are 400 feet high ; the road follows the dry bed of a stream. At miles the pass again narrows to 90 yards with steep slopes on either hand, where the track is nearly level and the going less stony. At 8 miles tin valley opens out into a small grassy basin two hundred yards broad, in which there are a fe^w stunted trees. At 8| miles the road emerges into a small grassy valley a quarter of a mile broad bordered on the north by a steep ridge called the Gumir Kuh, impassable on this side because of262 Route No. 53— contd. sheets of vertical limestone strata. The valley runs up two miles in a north-west direction and is well wooded. The road leads diagonally across the valley. To the south lie the undulating table land and hills of Asimabad, or Asmana- bad, where are the extensive ruins of an ancient city. A long gradual slope rises from here to the flat summit of Manisht Kuh. At 10 miles, the head of the valley is reached, and the read turns east up a stony rough ascent for four hundred yards through trees. The track is much obstructed by large stones. A quarter of a mile further on the track is rough, skirting a small craggy ravine to the right. This rough ascent could be made easier by carrying the road a wider sweep to the south and bridging the ravine or filling it in. At lOf miles, there is a sharp ascent by a series of zig-zags in the craggy hillsides for two hundred yards, and the track is much obstructed by overhanging trees which catch in the mule loads. At 11J miles the summit of the col is reached and the road proceeds along the ridge by a broad track. The soil is rich and grows good grass. The track is broad and well defined through forest, and the going is easy. At 12 miles the head of a fine valley, running in a westerly direction, and known as the Chillav, is passed. The track descends from the head of the col into it and then turns north again and emerges into a small grassy basin shut in between the hills. A road leads through Chillav from Gilan. This is the halting place, and it is some times used by the nomads as a camping gronud. A road branches off from here to Harunabad through Guar. Supplies might be obtained from the nomads, especially livestock. Route No. 56 crosses in this stage. 9 TIRAU CAMP 12J.^—General direction —— northerly 7 -. The road 160-| commences the ascent of the Kalaja Kuh, a lofty rocky ridge separating the road from the Harunabad district. The mountain side is sheets of grey limestone rock with but little soil between the stones, ^and fissured in all directions with deep ravines. It is quite barren except for a few stunted trees dotted here and there. The track winds slightly to the left over a stony spur on leaving the camping ground. At 1J miles there is a rough stony ascent but with an easy gradient. Were the loose stones cleared*263 Route No, 53— conid. a good cart road could be made. At 2 miles, the road rim.? along the edge of a deep craggy ravine filled with low trees and 'shrubs. A quarter of a mile further on there is a steep rough bit for 300 yards after which the gradient is easier to the &amp; summit. From here there is a gradual ascent following the line of a stony ravine. There are a few dwarf oaks, pis tachio, and hawthorn trees on the hillside. The track consists of several mule paths running between large stones. At 3 miles the summit of the pass of Darband-i-Kalaja is reached ? the crest of the ridge, a rounded summit, lies 1,000 feet higher to the right. This is the highest point on the route. The descent of the northern slope of the ranges is much steeper, and at the commencement of the descent the road leads between low trees and among boulders scattered about on the hillside. At 3* miles the road runs in and out of a small rocky ravine,, where there is more soil, and more trees and grass on the hill side. At 4f miles, the road becomes much steeper and is very rough in stony zig-zags. This lasts for 150 yards an then the slope becomes easier. At 4f miles the road is an easy descent among some clay spurs jutting from the foot of the range with well-wooded slopes. At 5j miles the foo of the range is reached and the route strikes across the Guar valley, which extends for some 20 to 25 miles'. Its average width is three to four miles, covered with an abundance of fine grass and watered by numerous small springs and streams from the foot of the border ranges. At 5 miles there is a stream in the centre of the valley, 12 feet wide and 8 inches deep with, sloping earth banks flowing over a gravelly bottom. t miles § the defile of the Tang-i-Juimark, 300 yards broad, is entered, in the range bordering the valley on the norm. 1 e road is a level and much used track, with rocky shelving slopes on either hand. About three-quarters o a mi e u the valley is 100 yards broad ; the road bifurcates, one bra h going direct to Karind over the Nua Kuh said to be a rough mountain track. At 9 miles the road emerges in _ grassy valley three miles long running nort -wes w A east and down which a small stream runs o Jo ^ ^ stream. At 10J miles the other side of the vall J 13 ’ and then the road ascends through a succession of stony spam and mounds. The track is good, but very roug tered loose stones. The Tang-i-Juimark presents no difficulties264 Route No. 53— contd. with the exception of the road being stony. The gradient is easy and the pass broad enough between shelving stony ridges. From here a small stony ridge is ascended, covered with stunted oaks and shrubs. At 11] miles, the summit of the ridge is reached and the road commences zig-zag ging down a narrow track over stones and boulders between low trees. The slope of the hill is 22°. This is the most diffi cult portion of the stage. After a descent of 320 feet the road reaches the level of the Tirau valley, and starts along a broad track across a grassy valley. At 12J miles the halting place is reached on the banks of a small stream. Several t Id ruins and the remains of an ancient town are scattered about the valley. The valley is twelve miles long and four miles wide divided down the centre by a succession of grassy undulations. There are two little streams uniting in one and flowing north west down the centre of the valley. The soil is a rich gravelly clay. The range to the south is much steeper than that to the north ; both are very stony and dotted over with low trees. This is a summer encamping ground of the nomads. Water .—From the streams.

The road. strikes diagonally across the valley from the camping gound, commencing the ascent of the rounded ridge nortlnwest of the valley. At 1 mile an ascent is made by a rough stony mule track, 6 to 8 feet broad, following the side of a small ravine. By clearing the stones this might easily be made into a good road. This series of undulating hills are known as the Chalbaca Kuh, which forms part of a long spur from the Nua Kuh to the north west. Paths cross it at any point. At 2 miles an undulating plateau is reached dotted over with a few good oak and pis tachio trees. There is no perceptible track here and horses sink into the soft friable soil at every step. At 3] miles a gradual descent is commenced following the line of a rocky ravine. At miles the road emerges on to a lower grassy terrace of the ridge, by an easy gradient. At 5 miles the ruins265 Route No. 53 — contd. 1881 J of a village are passed and the road descends a grassy valley bordered by a few stunted trees. Soon after the valley narrows to a quarter of a mile with craggy sides and the going becomes more stony. At 7-| miles the route emerges into an open basin half a mile wide with fine grass. Half a mile further on the valley again narrows to one hundred yards with low cliffs on either hand. The track is stony but the going easy ; a little clearing would make a road of easy gradient through this pass. At 8J miles the valley opens out again. A side valley bounded by rounded hills stretches away to the left for about a mile. All this ridge is fertile soil growing rich grass, but without a single inhabitant. The numerous ruins passed testify to former prosperity. The road now enters a craggy valley bordered by cliffs of grey limestone down which runs the Karind river, or, the Ab-i-Karind. This is called the Tang-i-Isma’ilu. At miles the river is forded, 30 yards wide and 2 feet deep, with a rapid stream over a stony bed among boulders, and the route continues along a broad track down the left bank ; the pass is a hundred yards wide and on either side are two high conical craggy cliffs Emerging frmn the pass the river makes a rapid turn off to the right and the road leaves it and turns up a small valley bordered by rounded hills. It is a well-defined easy track, along a stream bed, now almost dry. There are some patches of cultivation along the river bank. This is the first point where wheat was seen after leaving Mandall. At 10 miles the main road from Baghdad and Kirmanshah is reached; vide Route Iso* 54, Raghdeh to Xirmanshah via Khaniqin.

At 10 miles, the bed of an old canal is crossed. At 10| miles a sudden dip in the plain is reached. The Dialah river here is about a quarter iof a mile to the south, the river making a sharp bend. The road crosses a hollow said to be the ancient bed of the fiver, in which there is water in high floods. At 11| miles the river bank is reached. The stream is about 150 yards wide with a moderate current. It runs in a deep bed sunk 25 to 30 feet below the general level of the plain with steep earth banks. The ferry at the time of the report consisted of an old baggala, which carried about six animals. Buhriz is reached at 11J miles, and is a place of about 400 houses on the left bank of the stream.

The track is ten to twelve feet wide through barley and wheat fields. Good clover and grass on the waste land. The canals are mostly four feet wide and one foot deep, and easily crossed. The main channels are six to eight feet deep and difficult for mules. Flocks of sheep and goats are grazed on the plain. At 2 miles the small shrine of Imam Abu Fayiab is passed one mile to the south. There is a cluster of thirty mud huts with a few date trees around it. This forms a good landmark on the plain. The belt of irrigated land now gradually ceases and open alluvial plain commences. The shrine of Abu Khamls lies about six ; miles to the south. At 3J miles the irrigation cuts are left • and the route strikes across the plain in an almost due easterly direction. The track winds about considerably. At 6J miles are the ruins of Shahr Habib, where there are extensive ruins strewn with broken pieces of pottery and bricks marking the site of an ancient town.

The 181 road ascends gently np the valley passing some cultivation, a camp, and a stream at 21- miles. At 3 miles the road crosses the Gardaneh-i-Dar Badam. A range of steep hills lies on the right. Thence for half a mile the road lies over open ground, and passes a small spring, and then runs down a dry water-course. Then on through forest and across the plain of Saihas, which is well-wooded. There is a gentle ascent from the plain to the summit of a hill which is crossed at 6f miles and another at 7 miles. A quarter of a mile further on the road runs through a dry water-course, where the road is stony and surrounded by forest. A stream is reached at 8 miles, where a road branches off north-west to Khusruabad. After crossing the stream the road runs across a broad and level grassy valley, and gradually ascends to the summit of a low pass at 8f miles. The road now descends a steep and rocky hillside among dwarf oaks, and crossing a valley ascends gently to the summit of another low pass at 10| Details.270 Route No. 54. miles. From here the first part of the ascent is over rocks and is impassable to guns, after which the ascent is continued up a dry and stony water-course, between the hills covered with scrub jungle. At 12| miles the Ab-i-Karind touches the left side of the road. At 13f miles the river is forded, a swift and deep stream, 18 to 20 feet broad, between steep banks 15 feet high ; the ford has some 14 inches of water in it, with a firm bed and gravelly banks, impassable to guns. The route then lies over the plain, until just before entering the town, the main Baghdad -Kirmanshah road is struck and the town entered by it, having crossed two streams, about 12 feet broad, with stone bridges, and having passed a hillock with a ruined tower on its summit. dxi fi. vj vi JLJlxJLX WX I V* kDLTJ-fX.

Epitome.— This is the main caravan and trade route between Mesopotamia and Persia. It is a road quite-passable for wheels in dry weather, but in wet weather, unless the season is am exceptionally mild one, the road becomes very heavy and m places a regular quagmire. The complete journey is performe ; in 20 days by camels, and in 14 days by horses and mules. Mules, ponies, and donkeys are the usual transport animals, camels only being used in the summer and not after the rams have set in. , , As far as Khaniqln on the Persian border the road lies over rich alluvial soil, which in many places is subject to inundation. After one inch of rain the whole country becomes so boggy as to be almost impassable. From November to April the road is impassable for camels owing to the rain and snow. A t ersian Company was formed in 1905 to put and keep the road in repair.271 Route No. M—contd. It is now in very fairly good order and quite passable for wheeled traffic, though very rough in places. The range of low hills over which the road passes to Khaniqin would offer no obstacle whatever to the construction of a railway. There is a regular carriage service for pilgrims between Baghdad and Shahraban* Between Shahraban and Khaniqin stony ranges crop up across 'the road. .(vlutiobneeofolqn) As far as Qasr-i-Shirin (stage 7) there are practically no physical obstacles, with the exception of the extremely heavy state the road gets into after rain and the numbers of irrigation channels which have to be crossed. n: r M The boat bridge over the Dial ah river in stage 2 would require to be improved. It is only fit for the passage of light vehicles, unhorsed and man-handled over, and in its present state is unfit for the passage of guns or heavy vehicles. During heavy floods the boat bridge is often open for several days at a time. The pass over the Jabal H amrin in stage 5 is narrow but pass able for cars drawn by 4 horses abreast. At the pass in stage 9 guns would have to be double horsed in certain places. The first three miles of stage 10 are stony and exceedingly rough, and the remainder of the stage along the valley is heavy and swampy after rain and passes over frequent streams. In January and February the cold is considerable and water often freezes/ During July, August and September the heat is intense during the day, but it is unusual at any time to have very hot nights, and in June there is generally a refreshing north breeze. The annual rainfall is about five inches and falls in the cold weather. Between Baghdad and Khaniqin the rainy season may be said to commence about November, and to end in March. Beyond Khaniqln the rain starts somewhat earlier, and end later.' Snow falls in the regions between Sar-i-Pul and Kirmanshah. r * Water .—-Water is good and plentiful throughout the route, generally being obtained from streams or canals. Fuel .—Until Persian territory is reached, fuel is very scarce ; there it can be obtained in any quantities from the mountains, Supplies .—Supplies of all kinds would be available in large quantities especially after the harvest as the surrounding coiin** try is very rich and well*cultivated in the Baghdad districts. In the Persian districts there is not such a large amount ©i272 Route No. 54— contd. cultivation but still the country traversed is fairly rich, except on the frontier. Fodder. —The grazing varies much from year to year, there being seldom much except in the spring. Mules, donkeys and horses, usin g this route are fed on barley and straw, which are always procurable. In the spring camels graze on what they can find en route (up to the end of July). At other seasons they are fed on barley flour made into cakes, and straw. Transport. —At Baghdad about a thousand camels could be collected in a fortnight; other animals, ordinarily about 100 daily. Beyond Khaniqm no animals are obtainable until Kirmanshah is reached. The numbers otherwise, obtainable en route are mentioned in the various stages. Most of the mules- and ponies used in this route come from Persia, the chief breed ers being (1) Shirkhan, a Kurdish Chief now, 1907, Governor of Qasr-i-Shirin (2) Baud Khan, Chief of the Kalhur Kurds. If time was given very large numbers would be able to be collect ed, as this is a much-used route, and large caravans are conti nually passing along it. A motor service has been inaugurated between Baghdad and Bakuba. One omnibus to seat 30-40 people leaves Baghdad for Bakuba every morning returning to Baghdad in the evening, the journey each way taking about 3 hours. It is anticipated that in the near future more motors will be “ put on.” At present there are two motor omnibuses and two motor cars available for hire at Baghdad. The fare from Baghdad to Bakuba per passenger is one majidie. Arabanas, i.e., roofed carriages on four wheels drawn by four mules or ponies rim daily between (1) Baghdad-Bakuba, (2) Bakuba-Shahraban and (3) Shahraban-Khaniqin. These are available in the following numbers :— 1. Baghdad . .15 (about 6 wagons for heavy loads also available) 2. Bakuba . .10 (5 in Bakuba, 5 on right bank of Diala). 3. Shahralban • 8 4.

As the Arabanas leave each place early in the morning there is no question of connecting at the different places. If a pas senger wishes to do a through run arrangements for animals would have to be made beforehand. The hire for a whole Arabana from Baghdad to Khaniqln is about £5 Turkish. A bi-weekly carriage service was started from Kirmanshah- to Khaniqln in December 1910. (Lorimer)* Postal service .—-There is a bi-weekly postal service from Baghdad to Khaniqm which connects with the Persian service at Khaniqin.

Is crossed by a rickety wood and stone bridge of twelve feet roadway, width 12 feet, depth below bank 3 feet. There are a few crops near here. At 11 miles the road runs past a walled serai and a quarter of a mile further on a second irrigation channel, similar to the first, is crossed. On the other side of the channel the postal staging station is reached. From here an irrigation channel runs parallel to the road to 12 miles, thence diverging north. At 16J miles the road crosses a line of mounds running north-east and south-west indicating a former large Canal. The road from here again shows signs of flood till, at 18 miles, Khan Bam Sa’ad is reached. This is a village with two serais, one of which is 100 yards square of massive brick, in which there is accommodation for 300 men and horses. There are villages in palm groves about 4 miles to the north-west. The road throughout is good and passable by all arms in all weathers. ex: ii 3 ''- D BO EflUltS F Camping ground.—Ample.

At 6 miles the road to Mandali via Buhriz branches off to the north-east. At 8 miles there is cultivation on both sides of the road ; at 9 miles an irrigation channel, 6 feet wide and 3 feet below the banks, is crossed by a stone bridge in bad repair, the roadway of which is 12 feet. One mile to the east is a village in a palm grove. At 101 miles a narrow deep channel is crossed, 6 feet wide and 10 feet below the banks, running north and south. At 12 miles, the right bank of the Dial ah river is reached, a sluggish stream 60 yards wide with deep cut banks. There are gardens, dates, and poplar trees on either hand. The road now runs up the river bank the ground being cut up by natural wuter channels running down to the river. At 12J miles a small serai is passed to the left of the road and the Dialah river is crossed by a swimming bridge which is unfit for guns, consisting of 11 boats (with 2Route No. 54 — contd. spare for increasing the span when the water rises) over which a 12-foot road-way is laid. It is a rickety structure, quite serviceable for pack transport, but unfit for any wheeled vehicles except very light ones. The pontoons are in good condition, a very slight repair (materials for which are obtain able on the spot) would put the roadway into condition for the passage of guns. Guffahs are obtainable by which large quan tities of stores could be quickly transported across the river : Guffahs will hold from 4 to 20 persons with a corresponding weight of stores. The approaches on both sides are soft and likely to be slippery after rain. The banks of the river are perpendicular, the right being 15 feet and the left 30 feet above the level of the water. The road now runs in an easterly direc tion through high v/alled gardens, and at 13 miles enters Ba 5 - qubah where there is a telegraph and a post office. There is a good camping ground to be found anywhere outside the town. The road throughout is good and passable to all arms with the exception of the Dialah bridge. No camels.

The 47 road emerges from the northern entrance of Ba’qubah, through the walled gardens with an easterly direction, and winds through hillocky ground over numerous irrigation channels, and would be deep and bad in wet weather. At 3 miles, crossing an irrigation channel the road turns into a north-easterly direction which is main tained to the end of the March. The road here is a broad and level track over an alluvial plain. To the north-west lie numer ous villages, and the ground is low and in parts marshy, and cut up by frequent irrigation channels in some of which is water. To the east is a bare plain stretching to a distant range of low hills, on wdiich there are a few hamlets visible ; the plain is green with camel thorn and patches of grass. At 12 miles there are cultivation on either side and large villages four miles to the north-w r est.

Leav- 57 ing Abu Jisra the road runs over uneven hillocky ground showing signs of flood. On the right is a deep high banked irrigation canal. Numerous irrigation channels cross the road which is somewhat confined with banked canals on either side ; this applies to the whole stage. At 6 miles the road passes between the high walled caravanserai, 100 yards square, of the village of Jallali, where there are gardens and date palms. Emerging from the village the road crosses a canal 30 feet broad, running swiftly south east ; the bridge consists of one 12-foot arch of stone, strong, and in good repair. At 10 miles Shahraban is reached, where there is a telegraph office and post office, several caravanserais, and a roofed bazar. There are walled gardens and date groves. No camels. About 20 other transport animals could be collected daily. The road is passable in dry weather for all arms but it is deep and heavy, and impracticable for wheels in wet weather ; many culverts, ramps and bridges would be required. Water.—Goodi and abundant from wells and canals. Fiiel. —Scarce. Supplies. —Plentiful. 5 QIZIL ROBAT 18.—General direction ———- north-westerly. Pass- 75 ing through the roofed bazar and walled gardens of Shahraban. the road emerges over undulating ground showing signs of flood ; there are numerous irrigation channels in all directions, some of which are deep^277 Koute No. 54— contd. and narrow with few and bad foot bridges. At 4 miles the ground becomes more elevated and at 6 miles, a canal is crossed, 15 feet wide and 3 feet below the banks, by a bridge in bad repair ; roadway 9 feet. Immediately beyond this is a sluggish river, 20 yards wide and 15 feet below the level of the banks of perpendicular soil; the bridge is brick of ancient date, having a roadway of 12 feet between the parapets. There are some ruined houses near by. From here the road traverses undu lating gravelly country crossed by broad shallow ravines. Ris ing gently, at 7 miles, the road enters the Jabal Hamrin range of low barren hills by a narrow pass. The path here, wide enough for single animals only, is a deeply worn gut in the smooth rock. After some hundred yards the gut widens and the road spreads into several deep worn paths divided by ridges of smooth rock. There is a gradual ascent to 9 miles, the road widening and traversing some plateaux. At 10 miles the summit of the pass is reached, an ascent of some 400 feet having been made from the plain. The descent is gentle by a broad track over stone and gravel. At 12 miles the road emerges from the hills, and descending a gravel slope crosses a salt stream at 14 miles, and enters a broad plain, bounded except to the north, by low hills and ridges, in which there are a few villages and herds and flocks grazing. At 17J miles there is cultiva tion on either hand, and a half mile to the left the Dialah river flows in a broad, stony and rushy bed. Qizil Robat, which is now entered, has a post and telegraph office and several caravan- serais on the further side of the town. The first four miles from Shahraban is heavy in wet weather and impracticable for wheels, numerous culverts and small bridges are required ; the pass into the Jabal Hamrin is narrowed but passable. In the hills are also gradients and dangerous turns scarcely pass able for guns. No camels. About 50 other transport animals could be collected daily. There is a comparatively easy cart track over the Jabal Hamrin range by which guns could pass. It enters the hills about a mile to the south of the ordinary track and winds about till it joins after reaching the summit. W ater. —Abundant. Fuel. —Scarce. Fodder.—Good grazing.

The )shrid r yd .KAtt go -nit v/oi-Kj 94 road leaves Qisil Robat past walled gardens and houses and crossing a canal by a massive bridge, 25 feet roadway, traverses a cultivated plain. Irrigation channels cross the road and there are signs of flood in places. At 1 mile two canals are crossed in succession by bridges of strong masonry ; the road is now gravelly over un dulating country. At 6 miles, bare low hills are entered, the road, ; a broad stony track, ascending some 150 feet gently to a kutal. The descent is similar to 7^ miles, when, emerging from the hills, the road crosses the stony plain* to 11 miles. From this point another range is traversed to 14 miles, when a level plain of alluvial soil commences, bounded on all sides by low hills. There are villages some three miles to the north-west, with flocks and wheat fields. At 17J miles a low gravel ridge is crossed and Khaniqin comes in sight. At 18J miles crossing a stream, w r alled gardens are reached, passing between which, stony streets are traversed, and the bridge over the rapid stream of the Hulvan crossed at 19 miles. The river bed is 100 yards wide, and the bridge is solid brick and stone ; roadway 25 feet. The stream, 60 yards wide, is fordable. Khaniqin is situated on both banks of the Hulvan river amongst gardens, and possesses a telegraph and post office. The road is throughout good and passable to all arms in dry weather ; the first four miles from Qizil Robat would be, in wet weather, very heavy and impracticable for wheels ; no water or supplies in the centre 10 miles of road. No camels. About 20 or 30 other transport animals could be collected daily. Water. —Abundant; hI Supplies. —Plentiful. 7 QASR-I-SHlRIN 18.—General direction —— 1,800' north-easterly. The 112 road which is hard and stony, runs over a broken and hilly country. At half mile it commences to gently ascend some barren hills to the frontier line which is crossed at GJmiles, here there is a round mud tower and a Turkish picquet. Thence there is a descent over slabs of rock, deeply worn into many tracks, after which the road ascends and descends low bare hills. At 8 miles Kachkaehta.279 Route No. 54—com&amp;Z. At 10 miles a stream of brackish water is crossed. On the spur above is Qaleh Sabzi, a mud and stone fort manned by the Governor of Qasr-i-Shirin. A Persian custom house is situat ed on the eastern slope of the hill on which Qaleh Sabzi stands. Route 56 connects here. From here the road ascends gently, passing springs of water and Kurdish camps. At 15 miles Qaleh Shamilik a hamlet of reed huts with Sinjabi road guards whence Qasr-i-Shirin is sighted and also the Hulvan river, which latter is reached at 16 miles. The river here is 30 yards wide and fordable. On the left bank is a large grove of poplar and willow trees. Following up the right bank of the river, at IS miles the road passes under a hill crowned by a stone fort and reaches Qasr-i-Shirin. The road is good and broad through out, passable to all arms in all weathers, with the exception of a place about 5 miles from Qasr-i-Shirin, where the track goes over some sheet rock, which is not only steep but inclined at an angle sideways. Again, about 2 miles from Qasr-i-Shirm, the road along the hillside had fallen away and there is only room for one horse at a time. Water. —Abundant. Fuel. —Scarce.

Passing through 232 the steep and narrow streets of Qasr-i-Shirin the road emerges through a gap in the huge walls, and traverses some steep and rocky gradients leading to a wide plain. The road, which is now a broad track, level in some places, and up and down rounded spurs in others, skirts at 5 miles a bend of the Hulvan river, and ascends gradually over spurs of hills to the north, mostly over loose stones and shingle. At 10 miles there is a stream of poor water. Erom 13 miles onwards, streams of good water are crossed. At 15 miles the road ascends a small kutal overlooking the Sar-i-Pul valley to which a descent is made over hard and good going. At 18 miles, the course of a large irrigation channel is followed. At 18^ miles, an irrigation stream with a broad gravelly bed is crossed, and at 20 miles, Sar-i-Pul is reached, which is a dirty and ruinous village above the right bank of the Hulvan river.280 Route No. 54 — contd. The valley is mainly abandoned in winter at which time sup plies would be very scarce.

The road cross- 149 es to the left bank of the Hulvan by a massive masonry bridge, with a roadway of 18 feet, and skirts the base of a jagged range running down to the gorge of the Hulvan river. The road is a broad and stony track. At about 2 miles, it traverses the range mentioned above by a gap some 120 yards wide in which lies a recent vil lage called Mian Kal, and crosses a wide fertile plain with fre quent streams of good water from 4J- miles as far as Pal Taq, (3,350') at 10 miles where there is a caravanserai and room for camping ; water within half a mile, and forage and fuel abun dant. From here the road ascends the Taq-i-Girreh pass by a zigzag track of rough ad stony going, but with fairly easy ■gradients for 3 miles, and then passes up a narrow valley with wooded slopes running down to the road on both sides to Surkha Diza at 17 miles. Here there is room for camping. The road is passable for all arms, but artillery would have to be double- horsed at one or two places in the ascent'of the pass. Water. —Abundant. Fuel. —Plentiful.

At 3 miles the valley widens, and the hills recede, are lower, and have fewer trees. The road enters and crosses frequently the stream which drains the valley. At 6 miles it 164| 5,400 south-easterly. The road is very rough and281 Route No. 54— contd. emerges on to a grassy plateau, which gradually expands into a cultivated valley three miles wide. At 7| miles is the village of Sar-i-Mil consisting of a few huts. A side road from here runs over the hills northwards to Gavarra. The route now skirts the base of the hills to the north of the valley, and streams are crossed frequently. At 8J and 11J miles, respectively^ are the villages of Halateh and Harir on the left of the road. At 12 miles is a domed hauz. About this point the divide is passed where water flows east and west. At 14 miles the gardens of Karind are reached. The road is now of rough laid boulders between garden walls. The lower part of Karind is passed through at 15 miles, and half a mile further on open ground beyond is reached ; here there is plenty of room for camping, and a large serai in bad repair. The road throughout is bad ; the first three miles are stony and exceedingly rough ; and along the valley is heavy and swampy after rain and snow, over fre quent streams. Both parts of the road might be remedied with a certain amount of labour. This stage (1906) is said to be stony and difficult. Water .—Good and abaundant.

The track here becomes rough and stony.- At the bifurcation on the pass the right hand track should be taken as it is slightly shorter. A small stream rises here. Leav-- ing the pass the track, at first rough, descends gradually and passing over undulations reaches the broad plain of Maidasht at 8 miles. The plain is watered by many streams, at the cross ings of which the road is very deep and heavy. There is a considerable amount of cultiva-tipn, many sheep and numerous huts of nomad Kurds on the plain. At 12 miles, crossing the stream of the Ab-i-Mark, a stream 15 yards wide, with a firm bottom and 2 feet of water in summer, is crossed, the gradients in and out being easy. On the other side of the stream is the village of Maidasht, which-possesses a large and massive serai with accommodation for 250 men and horses. The village consists of some 60 huts.

At 5 miles it reaches and ascends a stony ridge at the foot of which a path from the main road to the summer camp of Muhammad ’All, chief of the Kalhur Kurds, runs north and south. On the further side of the ridge a grassy valley is entered, where there is a certain amount of cultivation, and where a number of sheep and cattle find grazing. The road follows this valley to 6| miles where it erosses a second ridge and skirts some stony hills. From this point a path to Sham diverges to the south-east. At 6| miles a small stream crosses the road. At 7 miles the village of Zarda Suvar is passed,'consisting of a few huts, some cultivation, and a poor supply of water. From here the road crosses some stony undulations and at 9J miles descends into the Zarbari plain, where a road to Zailan diverges east-north-east across the plain. Turning north, the path reaches at 10 miles the village of Chulak on the western edge of the plain, where there are 12 houses and .some bough huts in summer; there is also a considerable amount of cultivation, and abundant water from a kdriz stream. At 1QJ miles the road strikes north-east across the plain, which is well cultivated, and on which there are numerous nomad en» oampments, and herds and flocks grazing. At 12f mile the gardens of Tang-i-Shuvan are reached which stand nearer mountains on either side of the road to the pass. The village consists of some 90 houses.

The road ascends the stony slope behind the Tang-i-Shayan, and enters the pass by a broad stream flowing from it. The pass is forty yards wide ; and on either side low hills run steeply down from their summits which are about a quarter of a mile apart. The road emerges into an inner valley and turns to the east up a ravine with a stream of water. The hills rise steeply on either side, dotted with remains of oak forest. The path is now narrow in parts and bad but at 2|- miles the valley widens, the ravine opens out, and the slopes on either hand become more gentle. At 3| miles, the road emerges into the upland valley of Banarase, in which is some cultivation and many springs, and at 4 miles reaches at its head the open pass of Mil. The descent, to 4} miles, is in parts very steep and dangerous towards the Maidasht plain; the path then improves crossing stony bush-covered slopes to 5-| miles. It then crosses by easy gradients some gentle spurs to Ada war on the edge of the Maidasht plain at 6.^ miles ; here there is water, and flocks graze in the vicinity. Passing a large garden, the path, now a broad track, traverses stony slopes, joining at 7 miles the broad road running down from the ’Alia- var pass. From here the Maidasht plain is crossed by a broad and level road, occasionlly interrupted by irrigation channels^ reaching the Ab-i-Mark river at the small village of Siah Chaga at 11 miles. The plain round it is heavily cultivated, and south east and south, at distances of from two to four miles, are several large villages. The road throughout is passable for laden animals, but bad where noted between the Tang-i-Shuvan and the Adawar passes ; from the latter point it is passable to alt arms, but it would be very heavy in winter. Water .—Good and plentiful. Fuel .—No fuel, except cow dung, available nearer than the Kurkur range. /Supplies.—Might be collected. 15 KIRMANSHAH 12.—General direction ——_— north-easterly. The 229J road crosses the Maidasht plain by a broad level and easy track. At 3 miles it commences to ascend the outer slopes of the bare range dividing289 Route No. M—contd. Kirmanshah from the MaldasHt plain. The path ascends to the summit of the first ridge by a short but steep gradient reaching it at 3J miles. The road, then broad and level, turns east along a valley between bare hills one mile apart. At 4J miles, joining the road from the Kurkur pass and Pusht- i-Kuh, it turns north-east up a rough and stony valley, reaching the summit of the pass of the Safid Kuh of Kirmanshah at 5J miles. Prom here the road descends somewhat steeply to 6J miles, when it traverses a broad slope to Sar-i-Ab, the large spring and tank from which flows the chief water-supply of the city of Kirmanshah, at 8 miles. From this point there are several paths to the plain of Kirmanshah, some narrow and intricate, through the gardens above the city ; the easiest, path skirts the gardens and the city to the west reaching tte plain and open ground at 12 miles. The road as far as Sar-i-Ab is good and passable to all arms. The gradients over the Safid Kuh are occasionally steep for guns, which would have to be let down by ropes in places. From Sar-i-Ab the road is passable for laden animals, guns should make a considerable detour to the west to strike the road from Maidasht. i.si; JLU// ou 1JJJTU m gnui oiii i From QIZIL RORAT (Stage 5) to PAI-TAQ (Stage 9).

At 2J miles the track becomes covered with loose stones which make progress slow and difficult ; this continues with a few short breaks here and there till Ivan valley is reached. At 3f miles descend along a rocky slope by a bad bit of road and cross a dry water-course, ascend by a difficult track and at 4 miles reach Chah Gum-Gum, a well in a level bit of rocky ground with a good water-supply ; numerous heaps of loose stones in the vicinity are said to be the remains of an ancient town : general direction south-west. At 6| miles reach the summit of the Gardaneh Darreh Darlgh (Kurdi), or Darreh Daraz, [Persian), elevation about 6,200 feet. The Gardaneh is about 100 yards broad between low accessible hills. Descend by a road, very bad on account of rocks and loose stones, down a narrow valley with a dry water-course on the right, cross the water-course twice. At 8| miles there are high cliffs some distance apart on either side. At 9J miles the road leaves the forest and the hills on either hand recede. At 9f miles pass a small tree standing by itself in the valley, cross an irrigation stream and at 10J miles reach a good stream about 14 feet broad containing 18' of water and with easy banks flowing north-west down the Ivan valley A very bad road on account of loose stones and rocks. Impassable to guns after \ mile. This stage took 4J hours to traverse on horseback. There is an alternative route for the first three miles passing to the east of the route described.

At | mile the road, which ascends gradually, becomes bad from loose stones. Direction south, up over the hills ; road, now very bad on account of loose stones and rocks, enters forest and is impassable to guns. After a very steep and zigzag ascent reach the summit of the Gardaneh Runu at 2 miles. Elevation 5,850 feet. The summit of the pass is a narrow gap that a laden mule can just pass through. An im passable ridge of rocks to the north and precipitous cliffs to the south. Down a descent that is equally bad and difficult for laden animals. Direction south-west.

At 6 miles take the track to the left ; that to the right goes on down the valley following the water-course towards Mandall ; cross a dry water-course and pass some low hills. At 7f miles clear the forest and proceed on, descending gently broken ground on the left. At 8f miles a broad and deep water-course is on the left, direction at 9J miles is south.

At 3 miles the country becomes more un dulating and the road winds about ; Kaleh Kairan is on the left, hilly ground intervening, and the broken ground of a ravine close by on the left. At 4f miles reach the summit of the Gardaneh Shish Dar, elevation 4,540 feet, and descend gently amongst low hills towards Deh Bala, visible in the valley ahead.. General direction south-east by east. At 6J miles pass several copious springs bubbling up from under the rocks at the road side and cross two irrigation streams of swiftly flowing water. At 6| miles the drainage af the Deh Bala valley finds its way south through a gap in the range on the right about 1 mile off. The road winds considerably, running north-east by east, east and finally south-east. At 8 miles cross a stream in a hollow, at 9 miles cross another stream in a hollow, and at 9J miles reach the Deh Bala encampment. Road good throughout and could easily be made passable for guns. Guns would avoid the narrow pathway at the commencement of the march by making a detour to the south-west for a few hundred yards, by following the track which branches off to the right from the halting place.

The best time for the passage of this section is from June to the end of August, vide Supplies below. In winter the passage of troops- would be less easy owing to the snow from December to Febru ary, but the route is practicable throughout the year. Cavalry could reach Harsin (stage 2) in one march from the Kirmanshah plain if necessary. Infantry could, if desired, shorten the stages by halting on the Kirmanshah plain (stage 1) 5 miles short of Hajiabad, (stage 2) at Chahr, (stage 3) Harsin. The road is passable for all arms as far as Tamarg at the head of the Harsin valley. From there to the Gashur pass, 3 miles, requires widening and improving for the passage of artillery.. The gradients are not steep. II. —The second section contains no settled village from the Gashur pass to the centre of the Alishtar plain ; nor from Alishtar to Khurramabad. It is, with the exception of the Alishtar, entirely deserted from the beginning of October to May. From December to February or March the road is under deep snow ; it must therefore be considered a summer road, traversable only from the '15th May to October. The passage of infantry without cavalry would be difficult as the supplies have to be collected from a wide area as a rule, and the flocks and herds required would have to be driven in. With cavalry no difficulty would be experienced ; they should pass from Harsin (stage 2) to Alishtar (stage 6) in two days, and from there to Khurramabad in one day. From the Skirkani valley (stage 3) to the exit from Alishtar in stage 6, the road could be made practicable for artillery with some considerable work, but no rock exists and it could all be done with the spade. From Kaka Riza in stage 7 to the Rabat pass in stage 8, much work would be required and rock cutting at the Takatu and Rabat passes. The Governor of Khurramabad formerly took guns yearly to the Alishtar plain, but none but Persians are likely to attempt a like feat. From Chahr to the south-east edge of the Alishtar plain the road is protected from the north by high and rugged mountains ; and from the Alishtar plain to306 Koute No. 59—contd. r^he Rabat pass only is the country in any way confined, or the rroad contracted by gorges or adjacent mountains where the ^advance of troops could be barred by inferior numbers.

Prom June to the end of August the crops are either green, ripening or being reaped ; grass is abundant and the numerous flocks and herds are scattered about along the route.

The crops which are sown in September ripen, accord ing to the elevation, the following summer and are available as green forage to June and July, being cut and threshed to the end of August. These crops are wheat and barley. During August and September also the Indian-corn crop is available either green or ripe.

This bend in the road can be cut off, but the short cut is difficult and not much used. The road is undulating, good, and with very little preparation could be made excellent and passable for all transport the whole way. The country passed is very bare, devoid of all trees. A small part of the ground is cultivated, and there are a few isolated huts met with shortly after leaving Sar-i-Ab.. Two alternative tracks exist, unfit for caravans. Sarfaruzabad is the name given to that part of the valley to the south of the Safid Kuh. It covers a track of about 6 miles in all, and is visible from the road. Slrvanu contains about 100 houses and belongs to Habl- foullah Khan.318 Route No. 61 — contd . Water. None met with, en route. Plentiful and good from springs in Sarfaruzabad.

There is no bridge over the Ab-i-Marik ; stream about 2 yards broad arid about 1| deep. It has steep banks, but could very easily and quickly be bridged. Prom this point to the foot of the Tang- i-Kulilan the road is a broad track, and passable for all transport. This pass has a few difficult parts though generally good, no gra dients over 10°. The track, as it now is, is passable for pack transport only : no serious obstacles. ' The villages of Sarpushik (about 50 houses), Musamirinj' (400 houses) and Kulilan (40 houses) are passed en route. Talandasht is the name given to the whole valley which runs north-west into the Kalhur country. Water .—Good drinking water at the Ab-i-Marik.

The next pass, Tang-i-Kharribeg, is the only other obstacle, though not a serious one, causing hardly any delay. These two passes lead into one another in the mountains. From this latter pass down the Jalalavand valley there is a continuous descent, the first half mile of which is very steep, but afterwards a steady gradual decline. The pathway from the Tang-i-Kharribeg to the camping ground on the Ab-i-Yazman is good and clear and not stony. Mules did the journey without much difficulty, only two falling in the passes. There are about 200 huts in the vicinity of the camping iground. The Ab-i-Yazman is about 50 7 broad at the camping ground, and had only X' of water in August: stony bed. Water. —None till the Ab-i-Yazman is met.

The first 2 or 3 miles the road is very narrow and greatly cut up by irrigation cuts. After coming out of the Jalalavand valley it passes over easy undulating ground, and is a good open track ; but owing to constant ndlds it is rendered impassable for wheeled transport. In the first 2 miles the Ab-i-Yazman has to be crossed twice, at the first point the bed of the river is about 100 yards .across, the stream 15 yards ; at the second point the stream is about 20 yards across, and has more force of water. At the first place of crossing there is 1' of water and at the second nearly 2'. At both places the bed of the river is very stony : nevertheless it forms no serious obstacle. After entering the plain of Hulailan the road is a broad, clear, and level track as far as the River Saidmarreh Qarasu. This river has to Be crossed just before reaching Imamzadeh-i-Shah Muhammad. At the time of cross ing the water was up to, and over, the animals 5 bellies. The -stream being about 30 to 40 yards across. A fairly swift- xunning river, stony bottom, low banks. Pilleh Ean is the name given to the boundary between the Jalalavand and Hulailan countries.
