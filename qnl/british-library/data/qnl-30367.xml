Therefore, after giving the matter my careful consideration, I inquired from the manufacturers if they could duplicate my present plant, and have re ceived their reply showing their ability to supply. You realise that it takes many months for a similar plant to be manufactured and shipped, and to be installed for the next year. In view of the above, I shall appreciate if you could be so kind as to grant me Import Assistance Recom- mondation at your earliest convenience, I enclose herewith the necssary details and CAR RIER Corporation’s cable reply for your kind perusal.
