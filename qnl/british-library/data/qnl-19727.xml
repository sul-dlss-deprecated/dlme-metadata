This would not be at all an appropriate address for the Sultan here as it would arouse the jealousy,at present happily sleeping of Mahomed bin Abdulla,the Imam of Oman, The Sultan would probably welcome the change to the form you suggest but the mention of the word 'Imam' and the bringing of the Sultan's style into line with that of Ibn Saud may lead the Omanis to suppose that there is some truth in the ridiculous story of a triple alliance between Ibn Saud,the Sul- -tan and the Uritish G-overnment against Oman.

DtU X7,% 192C * 21 at February I926. &gt;V 9 }w UtQvztri, (sla reply to your D»0, letter dated the t5th February 19^6, I am afraid I was not, and am not, quite sure what the Intended use of the 'Alqabnamah' is. At first I thought it was merely intended to be a sample letter, which could be written in a dozen different forma equally good, and when correcting the proofs which you sent me in November, I only altered what was necessary to make it a suitable letter - without meaning to imply that it was in the form which I would necessarily employ myself, as it seemed to me that all that one really wanted to ^ ' lenow was whether to address a ruler as^Lfc^ , w ^ La ^* I gather now however that you want to have a sort of stan dard form, presumably for use at the Residency and by the Gov ernment of India, for writing to Arab rulers. Of thoae you send me now (1), (a) and (3) seem all right as letters, except that the old form to Hajd is now unsuitable as it addresses Ibn Sa'ud as (Excellency), which is not a big enough title for him; also in the new Muscat form I do 1 ( not know the word but presumaoly meant. In (4) the phrase or seems to me a little laboured - it is not necessary or customary to use the word for 'Highneaa', 'Excellency', etc., in all cases right '•W rahteihz . 3.SCT/a. re Home T* provided Se-cVC t'ciyy-tv fftcHushire.-■K '77 provided it is used fairly frequently^ Regardins the question of whether the terms ui i .usoat and Najd could not be assimilated, personally I do not think they should be; it is true we call them both 'nighness 11 in English, but the Sultan of Muscat of to-day is a very petty ruler compared with Xbn Sa^d^ and it is really only because of the past greatness of his House that we call him a ''.iighness 11 and a M Sultan M at all«^^^is a much more accurate translation of the word 'Hishness' than .When Ibn Sa'ud first took the title of Sultan, Sir Percy Oox told rae to send him a message of congratulations from him.l wired and asked him wnat title to use, as 'Excellency' seemed no longer suitable, and he replied that 1 was to call him 'High, ness' (using the Snglish word). This i translated , waich 1 used in several letters to him, but changed when I saw onat t)j.r Percy nimself used seems a digger i.iole, so should be kept for him, but 1 do not see any need to start using it for Muscat. Bahrain and Kuwait could certainly be the same, but i do not know about Qatar; is he an 'Excellency'? if so. Yes, but not otherwise. As uniformity seems to be what you want, I give below a suggested form of letter, which, with the slight modifica tions noted, would in my opinion do for all Arab rulers with which we are concerned. iTshould be understood that if be used in the heading, /Zr*' /y^ or ^OU-^respectively should be used fairly frequentlyfrequently in the 'body of the letter; if ^^ should / n n ? not, be similarly used, ADDRESS for Najd ( y c 1 for Muscat ,' A for Kuwait : A /« it and similarly for Balirain and any other 'Excellenoy' substitu ting the appropriate names and nonours. fibr all others. • y OPENING COMPLIMENTS (for all). ENDING (for all) . substituting Au^or - demand, ] N V As a matter of fact, I see in the papers that Ibn Sa'ud has now taken the title of 'King'. If so I presume we will recognise him as such, and that he will now be a 'Majesty' which will mean substituting AW for iP in his case. You might please let me know about this point, in case do have to write to Ibn Sa'ud at any time.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to correspondence regard- -ing the revision of the Alqabnamah. ending with telegram Ho. 236-H., dated the 7th February 1926, from the Government of India, and to submit herewith my draft of the forms to be used # , in correspondence with the States and Chiefships connected with this Residency. ■ 2. It has been considered necessary to suggest a number of changes owing to the need of bringing the Arabic used up to date, and to procure uniformity as far as possible in the cases (a) of the independent States of Masqat and Hejd, whose rulers (Sultans) hitherto have been styled 'your Highness'' ( Sahib al Azamah or aamu )^(bl of the Shaikhs of Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar, who are 'Your Excellency' ( Sahib as (c) of the six r rucial Chiefs who are addressed as 'Your Honour' ( Janabikum ). 3. The nine ohaixhs^ £Cb) and (c)J, are all styled 'Kuler' ( Hakim ) of their respective territories. 4. The question which now arises about Hejd is whether a new form is not required since the assumption by Ibn Kaud of the title of King of Hejaz. Is he 'King of Hejaz and Kejd' ' or 'King of Hejaz and Sultan of Eejd' ? In any case. I y ' believe2 A. believe that 'Sahilo al Jalalah 11 (Your Majesty J should be sub- -stituted for ' Sahib al Azamah ' (Your Highness). In the oases of Bahrain and Kuwait we have locally for many years discontinued inserting the expression 'and dependencies' in the address. I think the sajne should be done in regard to Nejd, but even 'Kejd and dependencies' seema better than ''•'ejd, I las a, Qatif, Jubail ( a village on the east coast of Arabia) and the towns and pprts belonging to them', seeing other that Ibn Saud is now certainly master of XtaB districts than Hejaz, Hejd proper, and the places herein enumerated. 5. With regard to the Bhaikh of Muhammerah I recommend that his name be removed altogether from the Alqabnamah. He has lost his semi•independent posltlon &gt; and if the Governor- -ship of Arab!stan is ever restored to him by the rersian Government it will only be on the usual Persian terms. As an ordinary 'ersian Governor he could,like the Governors of Bandar Abbas and Lingah,receive, when functioning, a salute of 5 guns. His personal salute of 7 guns and the salute of 5 guns for his eldest son should in my opinion be abolished. In this connection I recommend that the necessary corrections be made on pages 130 amd 131 of the Quarterly List of the Foreign and Political Jiepartment.

I' Gould you please refer to correspondence ending with - Walton's letter^ No.P.Z.8839/36, dated the 31st December, 1936, to you, communicating His Majesty's approval of the proposal that the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain should in future be addressed by all British Authorities as 'Your Highness'. ' ^• 'ith reference to the Ruler of Bahrain there has been some correspondence as to whether the term 'Amir' as used by the Saudi government when referring to this Ruler, is derogatory or not. Briefly, the views of the various Authorities concerned have been as follows: (a) The Government of India understood that the term 'Amir', as locally used in Saudi Arabia and the Arab Coast of the Persian O-ulf, implied a degree of subordination to the person by whom it is used, ''vide Menon's demi-offical letter No.F.482-N/36, dated 27th August 1936, to Walton. (b) Loch, ^vide his demi-official letter No.751-S, dated the 12th October, 1936, to Clauson, copy to you under his Printed Letter No.752-S, of same date, pointed out that while it was true that the term 'Amir' was used for Bin Saud's Governors in Hasa etc, the Ruler of Nejd used in former days himself to be known as the wahabi Amir, that in Kuwait the term appeared to be used as a high honorific,, and that there v /as at present the 'Amir' of Transjordania.' He did not think that exception need be taken to Bin Saud's use of the term in connection with the Shaikh of Bahrain. ^In a subseouent communication to me, however Loch mentioned that the term was regarded in Bahrain as suggesting subordination, but even so that exception need not be taken to the Saudi use of the term. (c) De G-aury, on the other hand, is of the opinion that if the English style 'His Highness' is inoroduced for the Shaikh of Kuwait, it might be more suitable to use the Arabic style 'Amir'. He considers, however, that it would be preferable not to change the Arabic style at present as it might prove rather 'Too strong beer' for the Shaikh, (d) Bullard, vide his letter No,2144/306/26, dated the 15th December, 1936, to Sterndale Bennett, a copy of which I enclose, is of the opinion that Arabic nomenclature was still too vague for any certain deduction as to implied subordination to be drawn from the Saudi reference to the Shaikh of Bahrain as 'Amir', 3, _ It will oe seen, therefore, that we have nothing definite to guide us. On the one hand the term 'Amir' is applied to the Ruler of Transjordania, who I suppose would take precedence of the Rulers of Kuwait or Bahrain, and is regarded in Kuwait as a high honorific; on the other, it is held in Bahrain to imuly subordination My own opinion coincides with that of Bullard i.e. that Arabic nomenclature is still too fluid for any conclusions to be drawn, and tT.-L.-i I think,/ le Hon' Die Sir Aubrey Metcalfe. KGIE., CSI., Foreign, Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. iI think, therBfore, that despite the change from 'His Excellency' to -■ v 13 ^ 1 ? 11 ^ 33 '' we s ^ ou l d continue to use the style 'His Highness the Shaiich for the Rulers of Kuwait and Bahrain. f' _. -f 0 ll 01 *'i r ig is a transliteration of the Arabic style -n which the Rulers of Kuv/ait and Bahrain are at present addressed ILS HAZHAT AL A, T AL AL AICRM1 AL AMHAK SAHIB AL ADAT AL MUADD AL SHAIKH SIR AHMED BIN -TABIR iiAI^AD BIN ISA AL K.C.I.E., C.S.I., HAKIM AL KCTVAIT AL KUHTARAM.

I suggest that after the change in English from 'His excellency' to 'His Highness', the Arabic style of addressing the Rulers of Kuwait and Bahrain should follow that of Muscat, with the exception that the word 'HAKIM', which is used on the Arab side of the Persian^Gulf to denote an independent Ruler, should be used as heretofore instead of the word 'SULTAN'. The form of address would lllus read:- ILA HAZRAT AL AKRAM AL AFKHAM HAMID AL SHI AM SAHIB AL MAALI SAKOV AL SHAIKH SIR AHMAD BIN TABIR AL Hamad bin isa al |3|IBAH_ K.C.I.E., C.S.I. , HAKIM AL KU.fAIT AL lOJHTA^AM. KHALIFAH BAHRAIN I am sending copies of this letter to Clauson, Bullard De Caury and Loch. ' Yours sincerely, Sgd. T.C. Fowle. Sent under Printed letter No.l47-S of 30th January, 1937.G 0 P Y (Received under Jedda endorsement No.2143/306/26 dated the 15th Dec. t 56) (My dear Sterndale Bennett), Your letter S.7034/2085/91 dated 24th November regarding Yusuf Yasin f s reference to the Shaikh of Bahrain as 'the Amir of the Bahrain Principality'. Calvert is certain that Yusuf Yasin used 'Amir' as the Shaikh's title and 'Imara' (i.e. amirate) for his realm. I agree that the Government of India's suggestion is nou worth pursuing. As Loch pointed out in his demi official letter No.751-S dated 12th October, the usage in the Gulf differs from that current here. For instance, Yusuf Yasin is always called 'Shaikh', which is used here for a townsman of conse uence whom the title of Effendi or Bey does not suit. On the other hand the princes Saud and Faisal are called 'Amir' and they are royal highnesses, though it is true that they may be described as subordinate, though only to the King, their father. Amir is also used in Saudi Arabia for holders of superior adminisurative posts, such as the governorships of Tebuk and Jauf and Median; and this does tend to reduce its status somewhat, even though the amirs in such cases are often relatives of Ibn Saud; but on the other hand the use of the title of Amir by the Huler of Trans Jordan tends the other way. The fact is, what with the clash of different, usages in these days when Arabic culture is tending towards unification, and the difficulty in finding in Arabic the exact equivalents for the ranks, conditions and degrees recognised by us, Arabic nomenclature is still too vague for us to^ draw any certain deduction from the words used by Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. However, it is an interesting point, and. if we get any evidence to support the theory that Ibn Saud regards the Shaikh of Bahrain as being in any way subordinate to him we will let you know.

These use a referencing system related to one of the older, inconsistent foliation systems. Notes on a document are assigned a page number accordingly.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence starts with the front cover and continues through to the last folio. This sequence is written in pencil, circled and positioned in the top right hand corner of the recto side of the folios. Two further foliation systems are present starting on folios 2 and 4. These two sequences are also written in pencil in the same position as the main foliation sequence, but are not circled (with an exception being on folio 2). These sequences sometimes miss folios or number both sides of folios.Condition: Due to wear and tear, some text at the bottom of the verso side of folio 49 is obscured.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file consists of telegrams, letters, memorandums, and extracts from the 'Alqabnamah', a register created and maintained by the British Government in India that lists details on the correct forms of address for the many princes, chiefs, sovereigns, and other notables in the Indian territories. It is this information, relating to the Persian Gulf context, that is the subject of the file.The correspondence covers several decades and is mainly between the Political Residency in Bushire, the Political Agencies in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Muscat, the Political Resident in Basra, the Consulate-General in Baghdad, the High Commissioner to Iraq, and the Government of India.The main pattern of the file revolves around revisions of the 'Alqabnamah' and the discussion around these. Revisions were made in 1912, 1916/17, 1925/26, 1931, and then quite regularly between 1934 and 1944. The rulers mentioned in the file include the Sultan of Muscat, the Sultan of Nejd (later King of Saudi Arabia), the Sheikhs of Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar, and the Trucial Sheikhs of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ras al-Khaimah, Umm al-Quwain, Sharjah, Ajman, and Kalba. The information given in the register includes the size of the gun salute given to each ruler.The file also includes correspondence regarding Persia, namely, the correct address for the Sheikh of Mohammerah (Khorramshahr), a standard for addressing Persian notables proposed by the Foreign Ministry of Persia, and the decision by the Iranian Prime Minister to abolish all old style titles and the adoption of more modern ones.Folios 198-218 are internal office notes, dated from 27 Jul 1928 to 3 Jul 1945.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000d2#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
