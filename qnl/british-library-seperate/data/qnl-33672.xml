                           Minervaand a local merchant, Johannes Muscow which is explained in the letter. This resulted in the Captain striking the merchant and led to a complaint being made to the Resident by Shiek Abdul Russool [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān] and a dispute over who should punish the Captain as a result of his outrageous conduct. The Resident further requests that if he is to be held responsible for the conduct of Englishmen by the Persian Government, he should have some means to regulate their behaviour.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100075534085.0x0000e4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
