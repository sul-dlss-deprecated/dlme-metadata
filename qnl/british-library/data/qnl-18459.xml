                           Tufungdar(representative) of Feerooz Mirza (Firouz Mirza Nosrat ed-Dowleh) Governor of Fars, arrived in Bushire, acting in the capacity of a Mohussil for the implementation of more stringent measures in the suppression of the slave trade. Samuel Hennell reports that the Mohussil also exacted a fine from a boat owner found with slaves on board his vessel. Hennell notes that these measures will be effective in Bushire where Persian Government power is strong, but doubts whether they will be as effective in Congoon [Bandar-e Kangan], Charrack [Bandar-e Charak], Mogoo and Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh], where Arabs on the opposite coast are reportedly using Persian boats to land slaves from Africa.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100028714542.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
