'i':i Bahrain Government is anxious about the number of Persians who are attempting to enter Bahrain without travel documents. Entry is usually effected from smalj boats lying off shore- from which men swim ashore. Ihc long coastline and numerous small islands off the coast and the small force of policemen and passport officials make it difficult for the Bahrain Government to deal sic essfully with these tactics. New arrivals, when challenged, are invariably able to produce witnesses from amor: ' ena fide Persian residents of Bahrain who testify the v, they were born in Bahrain or have been long resident rere. More efficient check measures are under cons id era .im* 133.
