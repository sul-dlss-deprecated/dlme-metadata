The main correspondents in the file are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, or staff from the Residency, the Political Agent in Bahrain, and Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah. The posts of Political Resident and Political Agent were held by a number of incumbents during the period covered by the file.The German film Wonckhaus &amp; Company, and the British firm Gray Paul &amp; Company, both had offices in Bahrain, and were agents for the steamship companies using the island’s main port. Both companies made repeated applications to fly flags, via the Political Agency, to Shaikh ‘Īsá during the period covered by the file. On each occasion however, Shaikh ‘Īsá refused permission to allow the flying of flags, with it being reported that he regarded the practice as an innovation improper for himself, and disrespectful to him as a ruler (folios 17-18a). The Political Agent, operating as an intermediary between Wonckhaus/Gray Paul and Shaikh ‘Īsá, offered the use of their own flagstaff to the steamship agencies when required (folio 16).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Steamships</topic></subject><subject><topic>Signals and signalling</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002ee#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002ee#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002ee#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002ee#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
