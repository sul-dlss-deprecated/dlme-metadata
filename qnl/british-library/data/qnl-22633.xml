To The Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire# Sir, I have the honour to forward for your considera tion a petition from Mr. Rahmatullah^ at present Head Clerk, Political Agency, Bahrain. He now withdraws his claim to arrears of pay, although it would appear that it has been his misfortune to lose a considerable sum of coney owing to the extreme dilatoriness of the Government of India in delaying the sanction for an Efficiency Test by passing which alone Mr. Rahmatullah would have been enabled to enter a higher grade of pay. He was first informed of the necessity for taking the Efficiency Test in 1931, but it was not until four years later that this Test was officially sanctioned, thereby preventing him in^roving his position during this period. Mr. Rahmatullah's claim for seniority over Mr. Ras Masud. Here again it would appear he has been unfortunate insofar as he v^as deemed to have held the post on 7-4-1931 whereas Mr. Ras Masud was only appointed to a similar posi tion on 1-4-1932. 4. Mr. Ras Masud, however, has been placed senior to Mr. Rahmatullah, which will, of course, prejudice hitr chances of ultimately attaining a senior position.~2~ 5. It appear that the one tra which is clearly visible in this rather formidable wood of data is the Ruling in the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rule 9(2)• I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, ^ _ 7^— • for political Agent, Bahrain.n Reference endorsement from H.B.M's Vlce-Consul,Zahidan. I submit herewith my peition claiming seniority over Mr.Has Masud.who was appointed in the Cadre on 1-4-32, but has been shown senior to me in the Cadre list although I was appointed to the Upper Division provisionally on 7-4-1931.

Since the terms set forth in Major Qastrel^s D.O.quoted above have been communicated to me through H.B.Majesty's Vice- C£&gt; Consul,Zahidan,vide his endorsement No .718/9/49,dated 27-6-37, I express my sincere thanks to the Hon'ble the Political Resident for counting my provisional service in the Upper Division post for purposes of increments. I therefore withdraw my claim to i arrears of pay for Rs.899-.6-0,for the period from 7-4-31 to 31—3-36• Claim for seniority over Mr.H as Masud. 4* Seniority of a government servant in a time scale cadre is determined from the date of his appointment in that time scale. ^ The mere fact that Mr.Ras Masud was a graduate on 1-4-32,cannot give him additional seniority as under the Fundamental Rules I held a lien on the Upper Division post on 7-4-1931,(P^.9(13) refers)* In this connection please see paras 6 and 7 of my petitio dated 4-10-36. /\ -2- &amp; &amp;. Assuming that as MxuRas Masud was a graduate he was entitled to extra seniority, why then was Mr«Shanaa,who is also a graduate and was appointed to the Upper Division on 26-8-32 f shown junior to me in the cadre list f when my confirmation was considered doubtful until 1933? 6# Further if prior confirmation of a government servant ia a cadre is considered an authority for seniority why Mr#Bhasl3\ has been shown junior to Mr*D t Sou2a| when the former was ■ confirmed in 1933 and the latter in 1936* / ?• In view of this the reasons given for the privileged circumstances shown to Mr^Rsts Masud in para 5 of Bush ire Residency Memo No •2427 are quite untenable• 8. Since I was holding the Upper Division post in a provisionally substantive capacity^ and have been subsequently confirmed in that post without having reverted therefrom I am deemed to have held the post on 7«»4—1931{C*S*(C«C»A*)Rulej9| sub-clause (2)refers)« 9, in view of the fact that the date of my appointment i«e•7-4-31,has been counted towards service for pay In the Upper Division time scale I am deemed to have been holding the post on that date (Graded List of Officers of the PoliticaJ. Department on time scale pay illustrates this)* 10• Moreover my scale pay in the Upper Division is H8*220y | p #nu while that of Mr«Ras Masud is only Rs .160/- p^bu My grade pay being more than that of Mr•Ras Masud is itself a substantial proof that I an senior to him* 11, In view of the fact that my provisional service In the Upper Division has been held valid for purposes of incrementi as well as of service there is no reason why this service should not be held valid for purposes of seniority as well.~3~ n 12• A perusal of the above quoted statutory rules leaves no doubt that I am senior to Mr#Has Masud» I therefore pray that my position in the cadre list may please be amended to next above Mr.Ras Masud, else my future interests would be considered to have been unfairly damaged(note dated 14-8-31, by Capt.Bradahaw f Secyito P#R.refers,copy attached for ease of reference)* I beg to remain, Sir, Your moat obedient servant, Offg»Head Clerk, Political Agency,Bahrein.

Dear Sirs, Would you please arrange with your Basra office to reserve one second class berth without food for Mr- D.J. Stephens from Bahrain to Bombay by the fast down steamer service due to leave here on or about the 26th June 1939? I should be obliged if you could confirm that the passage has been reserved. 2. Yourwill be paid in due course Yours faithfully. q. for Political Agent, Bahrain.a.p.a. I understand that bookings by B.I. 4o India will be heavy for the next month or two. Mr Hafiz was provided no cabin accommodation owing to the fact that there were no second class betths available; and he had to travel deck. Gray's do not advise Basra of the bookings here (except on payment of telegraphic or other charges) which means that no allotment is made for passengers from Bahrain. In the 1 request that we write to Grays to book^provisionally(and subject to confirmatic one second class passage Bahrain - Bombay for me by the fast mail service due to arrive here on the 25th June or 2nd July next? Mr Thomas has informed me privately that he will ssd sail for Bahrain definitely on the 18th and arrive here (by fast mail) on the 21st June, which means, subject to P.A's approval, that I will possibly be able to hand over and leave by the mail of the 25th June. ^-wv /-hrc . ?A - g- ■*UJ btzW / Z(^'To Telegram - GTC.

Mr. Ghulam Muhiyuddin arrived at Karachi on the 13th January, embarked on the forenoon of the 16th January 1944 and disembarked here in the evening of the 6th February 1944. Under Supplementary Rule 294-A read with the External Affairs Department memorandum Ko.

Mr. Ghulam Kuhiyuddin points out that a letter posted at Karachi on- the 13th January 1944. the date of his arrival there, would have reached here by sea mail on afternoon of the 6th February 1944 by the steamer by which he actually travelled and that therefore he is entitled to Joining time of 25 days( from the 13th January 1944 to the 6th February 1944) plus 8 days, i.e. 33 days. His leave therefore ended on the 4th January 1944 and joining time commenced ft*om the 5th January 1944. 4. If this method of computing joining time is considered correct it is requested that an office order about h is appointment may kindly be issued and a copy sent here for record. for Political Agent,Bahrain. pV - ^ 13ahrain, the 21st February 1944. To The Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I handed over charge of* the post ol 1 Head Clerk on the forenoon of the 7th February 1^44 and an now waiting for a steamer to proceed to India# According to 2y4-A 1 am only allowed 8 days plus the actual number of days taken in transmission of mail letters at the time as joining time but Bushire Residency in the past allowed 16 days fixed Joining time between Bahrain and Karachi and now 1 understand sckxhsc ^ allow actual time spent on board the ship plus 8 days. However the reading of the rule H the actual number of days occupied in the transmission of mail letters at the time when the Journey is made plus 8 days 4 * is ambiguous and l think it covers the period of waiting at a port, for a letter posted on the day 1 handed over here would arrive Karachi by the next steamer by which 1 would travel and the number of days which would be occupied in its transmission from Bahrain to Karachi would include the period of waiting at Bahrain during which period it would remain in the Fost Office but never the less be in transmission from Bai rain to Karachi* ^ If according to Bushire 1 s recent interpretation that the days of waiting are not to be included in the number of days in transmission of mail letters my leave would commence here on expiry of the 8 days and it would be treated as leave on half average pay. 3 As I am not entitled to Deamess Allowance or House Rent while on Joining time or on leave it will be very six difficult for me to make both ends meet on my half average pay in Bahrain due to the very high cost of living here. Since the mail steamers are very irregular and there is no certaintyo±' getting a passage in the near future I request that Bushire be asked to appoint me in a post that may be vacant elsewhere and I be al3-Owed to work here till such time the boat arrives and the period already spent on joining time and waiting period be treated as leave on average pay.

I am entitled to take furlough under Capter XIV, Section II of C.S.R. as I have 20 years of approved service. i In 1920 I suffered from a severe tvpe of bubonic plague in Mesopotamia whilst in service. The effect, of this disease is that I have lost both my left eye and ear and since then I am not keeping good health. I am also suffering from heart tdisease and doctors have forbidden me to take any violent exercise. In 1932 I was very bad at Bushire with Pericarditis and Ma.lor Rooney# the Residency Surgeon was very kind enough to take me up to Bombay and look after me during the voyage. His certificate is enclosed herewith. ^ As I intend to proceed on furlough# no medical certificate is required. When my furlouffh is about to expiry, I will have to apply to the Hon'ble the Political Resident stating that I intend to retire on an invalid pension and requesting hia that the necessary arrangement may be made for me to appear &amp; k £ b beforo TiSJi a Medical Board or Medical InvalldinR Commllitee and thla ■ Committe will cive their final award on the state of my health.

Mr. Nasir-ul-Haq is willingly prepared to work as H.C. in addition to his own duties, for three months. There are precedents of this nature before i.e. Acctt. has been offitiating for H.C. for small periods. If you approve the following arrangement may be suggested to Major Alban as I am most anxious to proceed on leave as soon as possible. Division to work as offitiating Accountant but to continue to work as 3rd Clerk. Mr. N.Haq will do the Acctt's work also but will take help from Mr. Rabbani and Mr. Zafar Islam whenever necessary. In this way all three Mr. N.Haq, Mr. Zafar Islam and Mr. Rabbani will benefit financially. As the period ix for this arrangement if for three months only, and all three of them are willing to work slightly extra xttkBHt of their own free will, I think the work will go on very smoothly# I submit a draft telegram to Major Alban as 1 think before replying to Bushire we may obtain kaxxac his apprc Mr. N.Haq to work as H.C. Mr. Zafar Islam, the next senior in the LowerA - M would cause me great inconvenience and also financial loss that I have made arrangements iHxmy with my home people according to this programme. If it is not possible to allow me my full 8 month f s leave, I shall be grateful if I am allowed only 7 day's leave now/, and I will return by the first week of November. Including joining time it would make about 38 days, and as Ep . Rajagopalan will be returning by this up boat, Mr. Ahmad Khan who has been loaned to C.C. by Captain Metcalfe could help the English Office. If there_are any arears I would clear them as soon as ponaiblr. is In case the latter proposal/accepted I submit a draft for Bushire so that they may not deprive me of raf leave when eventually a relief is found. /Zj '' -t ^ ^ /Y ^a.
