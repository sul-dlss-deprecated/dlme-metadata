Dear Sir, S.S.»CITY OF CHELMSFORD” We are enclosing herewith articles for the above vessel which please return to bearer after duly endorsing.

'■ rf' /tj* Mr ^ 4-^ itZ A: imf* 4 ■ f-4-^■HHi © Political Agency, Bahrain, 25th March 1950 It is noticed from your letter OS/325 dated the 22nd March 1950 that the s.s. w CIT5T OF CHELMSFORD' arrived at this port on the 17th instant but the ship^ articles form (Eng.l) was deposited with this Agency by your representative on the 22nd March 1950 and taken away again the same day. Although admittedly this practice has been in vogue here for some time it is not consistent with Section 257(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act which is reproduced below:- 'Whenever a ship, in whatever part of Her Majesty’s dominions it is registered (except a ship whose business for the time being is to carry passengers whether cabin or steerage passengers), arrives at a port in a British possession or at a port elsewhere at which there is a British consular officer, and remains thereat for forty-eight hours, the master shall, within forty-eight hours of the ship's arrival, deliver to the chief officer of customs or to the consular officer (as the case may be) the agreement v/ith the crew, and also all indentures and assignments of apprenticeships, or, if the ship is registered in a British possession,such of those documents as the ship is provided with'. I shall be glad if in future the above instruc tions are complied with. The documents will be kept in this Agency during the ship's stay in the port and returned within a reasonable time before its departure to your representative (who should come and collect them) after making the necessary endorsement on payment of the relevant fee.
