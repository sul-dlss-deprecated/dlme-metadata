The Captain sent a telegram asking me to go and see him in uioai. I immediately hired a launch and left for Libai where I went to the Man-of-War. The Captain informed me tnat a sailing boat belonging to Libai people was seized by the Persian ship ' Palang ’ off Tinb Island. The Captain askea wnat cargo this sailing boat was carrying from Libai to Persia. I told him that I had no knowledge about this boat. He enquired trom me if the Shaikh knew about this boat. I told him that I did not know, but if he wanted I could ask nim(Shaikhj about it. He ordered me to ask the Shaikh. I took his leave and landed but it was ciark then. In the morning, the Shaikh and myself got on the launch to go to the Man-of-(liar and while we were on our way we met the jolly-boat,about which the Captain had a talk with me, m the mou'-th of the creek. I told the Shaikh that we should take the Nakhudha of the jolly-boat with us to the Captain. We all went to the Man-of-^ar and afte: the Shaikh uad an interview with the Captain we, sitting together, made enquiries from the Nakhudha. Ee(Nakhudha) stated that ne left Li Dai for Tint) Island with four jolly-boats.. That v/nen they left -uibai for Tinb the wind was calm. Three jolly-boats reached Tinb, but as the wind was calm this jollyboat was taken by the current towards Al-Mamlahah on the .ersian Coast. When the wind blew m her favour the sailing-boat returned to Tinb Island. As soon as she reached the place from which tney take stones she anchored. Theship t ralan^ T came to them and. a launch was lowered from her. They seized the haMmdha and took him to trie ship. The launch then returned to the jolly-boat and began to searfch her. The Cpatain of the snip began to enquire from the hakhudha as to what did he load from and and discharge on the Persian Coast. The Nakhudha replied that he did' not load or unload anything. x nat as there was no wind the jolly-boat could not reach trie Island and was taken by the current to a place near a! Mamlahah but when the wind, blew he returned to Tinb Island. me Captain threatened the iiakhudha with unsuitable words, but wuen he saw -that two Men^oi-War had arrived at Tinb, the Can tain! ot the ship Persian^vernment allowed the Nakhudha to ihe Captain(ot H.M.S.

The boat in question bears the nationality of Dibai Government and her real owner is Muhammad Khan, Munshi of the agent of the B.I. at Dibai.

He was releasee from the ship when the two Men-of-War of the British Government arrived at Tinb Island.

The particulars of the case are given in the note, copy of which is enclosed, which I am addressi ng to the Iranian Government. I had arranged to present this note personally to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day, but His Excellency was at the last moment unable to receive me. I will, nowever, take the first opportunity in the next few days of presenting the note to him and drawing his attention to the very serious situation which is likely to arise if the activities of the Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf cannot be controlled. In the meantime, in order to avoid missing the bag which goes to you to-day, I enclose as stated above, a copy of my note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 3. I am sending copies of this deppatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No.49, to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No.21, and to His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, No. 10.

Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that my attention has recently been drawn to a serious case of interference by a ship of the Imperial Iranian Navy with a Kuwaiti dhow, flying the Kuwaiti ilag, outside Iranian territorial waters. The facts are as follows : 2. fhe name of the dhow in question is the FURAT and her nationality Kuwaiti. She is owned by Ibrahim son of Abdul Aziz Motawah and her Nakhuda is Gnulam son of All. On January 25th (5th Bahman) the dhow was bound for Gwadur wi th a cargo of 2592 pieces of silk, packed in 130 sacks, the property of 'Yusuf son of Marzook. About half a hour after sunrise the dhow was making for Khasab Bay to take shelter from a strongly easterly wind. After passing Has Sheikh Mahsud and when out a mile distant from the shore, the dhow which was flying fhe Kuwaiti flag, was stopped by an Iranian sloop, believed to have been H.I.M.S.Babr, and was towed to Lingah. The arrest of the dhow was witnessed from the shore, ^n arrival at Lingah the cargo was landed and the dhow and crew were detained at Lingah until the 28th February (9th Ssfand) when the cargo was returned, except for sixteen pieces of silk which could not be traced and the dhow was released and left for Dahai. 3 . / His Excellency Monsieur Ehayatellah Samiy, Hinisterfor Foreign Affairs, TEHRAN. t ' t.z 6 . / v % - 2 - 3. Your Sxoellenoy will observe that the dhow was seized not only many miles outside Iranian territories but actually within two miles of the Arab Coast. I am compelled to make to Your Kxeellency a strong protest at the action of the Iranian warship concerned, ani I have the honour to request that Your Excellency will be so good as to cause a strict enquiry to be made into the circum stances of the seizure, and instructions to be issued for the immediate return of the sixteen missing pieces of silk and for the payment of compensation for the loss suffered by the owner of the dhow through the detention of the vessel for over a month. the same time I have the honour to remind Your Excellency that on July 31st 1936 (9th Mcrdad 1315), Mr. Butler addressed to you a note (No.428) regarding the incident which took place on the night of the 14th May 1936 (24th Ordibehesht 1315) when an Iranian customs launch fired without warning on the Kuwaiti dhow ’’Suhail' 1 and seriously wounded one of the crew. No reply has been received to that communication. 5. I am confident that Your Excellency will appreciate that incidents of this nature must inevitably cause a most unfortunate impression and arouse great resentment. I am sure also that the Imperial Gov ernment are as anxious as i are His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the \ Government of India, that any such incidents should be V avoided. I have t herefore the honour to request that the cases brought to Your Excellency’s notice may receive urgent attention, and that strict instructions may be issued that Iranian vessels should refrain from any interference /; 9Jai presents his CONFIDENTIAL.

Seizure of a Kuwaiti dhow by Iran ian Customs Authorities at qusbeh.HQTB, 3ubject t Seizure of a Kuwaiti dhow by Iranian Oustoiaa Authorities at qUSBBH. I di a cussed this case with Captain de Uaury at Kuwait. Captain de 0auiy explained that this case was a typical one. The Iranian tfovernraent have forbidden Iranians to own dhows built in Kuwait, and presumably this order applies to dhows built anywhere on the Arab Coast. The idea behind this order is that the Iranians should build their own dhows. This, however, they ear^t do. An Iranian, therefore, wishing to own a Kuwait built dhow, gets the dhow registered in Kuwait nominally as belonging to a Kuwait merchant. The dhow then flies the Kuwait flag but to all intents and purposes is an Iranian craft, since it is really owned by an Iranian and the Captain la Iran lan as are the crew. 2. If auch dhows are seized by tne Iranians, as in the preaent case, therefore, we are really on a bad wicket in protesting. Captain de G&amp;ury will explain the position to the Shaikh and in future the reports from Kuwait or other posts on the Arab e ide of the seizure of &amp;oy dhow should menfc ion if the dhow does or doea not come within this doubtful category. 3.

After describing the incident to His Excellency, I pointed out that the action of the Iranian vessel appeared unjustifi able; I thought it well to add, as the Iranian authorities are no doubt aware of the fact, that it might well be that the dhow* s cargo was intended for smuggling purposes and that I had in fact heard that it had been hoped to smuggle the cargo into India. Hut even if this were so it provided no justification for the behaviour of the Iranian vessel. I added that these incidents, if continued, must inevitably lead to some really serious incident and loss of life, and that it was really important that proper instructions to prevent them should be given. 3. Hather to my surprise Monsieur Samiy did not contest the right of His Majesty* s Legation to make representations on behalf of the Arab rulers. He may however have been ignorant that this was the usual gambit for an Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and may well raise the point in his written reply. Heundertook to look into the matter at once and did not attempt, for the moment, any defence of the action of the Iranian vessel. 4.

Your Excellency will remember that I called on you on the 16th March last (25th Island, 1315} and left with you a note respecting the arrest by an Imperial warship of the Kuwaiti dhow 'Eurat*. In the fourth paragraph of that note I also invited Your Excellency’s attention to the fact that no reply had ever been received to Mr. Butler’s note No.428 of the 31st July 1936 (9th Mordad,1315}, regarding an incident which took place on the night of the 14th May 1936 (24th Ordibehesht, 1315) when an Iranian Customs launch fired without warning on the Kuwaiti dhow *Suhail* and seriously wounded one of the crew, 2. As I pointed out to Your Excellency, incidents of this nature cause a most unfortunate impression and arouse great resentment; and I made the request that these cases should receive urgent attention and that strict instructions should be issued that Iranian vessels should refrain from any interference with Arab dhows outside Iranian territorial watera, 3. as almost six weeks have now elapsed since I left this note with Your Excellency. I am venturing to send you this private letter to remind you that my Government regards these incidents as possessing both great importance and great urgency. A moat serious impression will be caused unless they are rapidly and satisfactorily settled, and I would therefore express the strong hope that Your Excellency will be able to furnish me with a reply to my note at a very early date.

His Excellency Hons i eur Enayatollah . Sanity, -ilnister for Poreign Affairs, Tehran Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that my attention has recently been drawn to two cases in which ships of the Imperial Iran iar Navy have interfered with Arab vessel* within Arab territorial waters. 2. The first incident took place on the 25th January (5th Bahman). On that date H,I.M.S.*3abr M stopped and searched two dhows belongint to Debai. The first dhow was searched two miles north east of Quoin Island, and the second one mile from ^uoin Island. Both dhows were therefore stopped within the territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat. The first dhow is the property of Muhammad Khan of Debai, and its Nakhuda is named Ahmed Ali Harmuzi. The second belongs to a relative of Muhammad Khan and its Nakhuda is Hasan Tahlak. The two dhows carried passengers and cargoes of salt, dates and clothing for the Bat in eh coast. The cargoes of both dhows were searched, being prodded /prodaed with a steel prong, and the baggage and clothing of the passengers and crews were also searched. After completion of the search, the dhows were allowed to proceed. The second incident took place on the 16th February (27th Bahrnan). On that date an unnamed jolly-boat, belonging to Debai, sailed from Khassab to Debai with a cfargo of dried flah * The Joily-boat is the property of Human bin Khalfan al Basti of Debai, and the Nakhuda is named Ali bin Hasan ash-Shahi of JChassab. At about noon on the 16th February (27th Bahman) an Iranian warship was sighted coming from the direction of Henjam. The name of this warship is not known, but it is believed that she was H, I *M.S. 'Chahrok#.”. //hen the jolly-boat was off Ghamda (between Bakha and Sha’azn) she was overtaken by the warship, which stopped a few yards distant from her. Both vessels were then about one mile from the shore. The Nakhuda was ordered to go aboard the warship, where he was questioned about the nationality of his boat, himself and his crew. He 'was then allowed to proceed. Your Excellency will observe that in both these cases, Arab vessels from Debai were stopped by Iranian warships actually within Arab territorial liters. In these circumstances I must make to four Excellency a strong protest-3 - -t tue^e further cases of interference with Arab vessels outage Iranian territorial waters In my note No.112 of the 11th March (20th Ssf&amp;nd 1315) I had the honour to remind Your Uxcellency that incidents of this nature could not but make a most unfortunate impression. I have no doubt that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India will view these further incidents with much concern, and I would therefore again earnestly request Your Excellency, i n the interests of the friendly relations so happily existing between those Governments and the Imperial Government, to cause strict instructions to be issued to the Commanding Officers of His Imperial Majesty's ships to abstainffrom inter ference with Arab vessels outside Iranian territorial waters. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. fsigned) H.J.SEYMOUR. VCONFIDENTIAL.

If this suggestion, which seems arima facie sound, is aaoptea, I presume that tne repeal of the proclamation, would have to be notifieu officially to the Persian Govern ment - or at any rate tnat it would somehow come to their notice (there would not be much point in doing it otherwise).

Political Agent,Bahrain’s ^ note dated the 9th October 1937. Detention of a Bahrain l, boom ,, j in Khorramshar.•''x Before deciding to tender advice to the Bahrain Government T carefully considered the events which had led up to the situation as it was on the morning of the 7th. October. The events to date had not been of such a nature as to cause any particular interest or excitement cw.ong the general populace of Bahrain nor would the de mand by the Persian authorities that a Bahrain registered dhov r should obtain separate registration papers in a Persian port cause any particular excitement among the Trucial Shaikhs or in Qatar. In fact, I considered tnat a solution to the situation as it was up to Octo ber the 7th night easily be forthcoming as a result of the oisnnoSj-ors whxch no doubt would take nlace b etween His Majesty 1 s Minister in Tehran and the Iranian Govern ment. T presumed that a formal protest would be made on behalf of the Shaikh, of Bahrain and possibly as a result of this protest the Iranian Government would refrainfbom taking any further action in regard to Bahrain register ed dhows. It was possible that the Iranian authorities might disregard anb such protest but their disregard would * T thought, be more a matter of theory than of practice, in other words, while refraining from acknow ledging or accepting a protest on behalf of the Bahrain Government, they would not be prepared to take the con sequence which might follow from any further practical action against Bahrain dhows. T felt that it was advisable to avoid any further incident such as an insult to the Bahrain flag or some unfortunate happening with regard to the hoisting or flying of the Persian flag on the 'boom”. If such an event had taken place it would be known almost immedia tely in Bahrain and would cause considerable feeling. It would be known throughout the Trucial Coast and would there/--2- there also cause excitement. • If such an event 'had occurred, his Majesty's Government would naturally take diplomatic action hut their action probably would be influenced by wider considerations of 7 .-&lt; ons of world events and they might possibly not feel disposed to take such strong action as 'he Shaikh of Bahrain and the Trucial Shaikhs would consider adequate. The result of this would be that our prestige would not be improved and unless I was quite certain that diplomatic action which would be adequate in the eyes of the Shaikh of Bahrain was likely to be taken I did not feel justified in ad vocating a course of action which might result in a serious incident. A. decision had to be made immediately and fchafc there was no time to ask the Political Resident's advice as it was already late in the morning on the 7th of October and if action was to be taken it would have to be taken before Friday morning, i.e. October the 8th. It seemed to me that should the Iranian authori ties be prepared to go further than they have already done with regard to the question of registration, in sp:te of any protest which might be made by His Majes ty's Government, then there was certain to occur fur ther incidents of a like nature to the one which had just taken place and there would be amnle onportunity for a more determined policy to be followed in the future. 2. I discussed the situation with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government on the morning of the 7th of October immediately after the receipt of telegram ^ 24 dated the 6th October 1907 from His Majesty* s*'’, Consul, Khorraashahr, and I deciled to advise the Bah rain Government not to take any action which r 'ight precipitate incidents more serious than those which had/--3- had already taken Diana r Place. I suggested that they should safeguard their rights by making- it quite clear that th6y WerS lnStrUCtin S the nakhuda to return to Bahrain in order to avert a serious incident and to avoid any possible insult to the Bahrain flag. Although the ques- ti,on ot loss to tha ovtipt 4 n-p ■ mi 0 ^ €r of the hoorn ,f through deterio- ration Ln the cargo consequent on delay v/as mentioned the owner was quite prepared to lose both his ca^o and hio boom if the Bahrain Government considered it ne-es sary for the -boom- to remain in Persian waters.

Political Resident 1 Political A^ent, Government of India, i of Persian authorities as merely logical outcome of Persian claim to Bahrain and possibly intended as retaliation for recent(?) Bahrain Nationality and Property Laws. They feel no representation on their part would induce Persian Government to modify what are clearly standing (?) instructions regarding treatment of Bahrain dhows in Persi— po^ts. But silence might be interpreted as acceptance of Persian point of view and they therex^re think a protest should be made to Persian Gov ernment. It is suggested that in all circumstances that pro test should be purely formal and made preferably at request of Shaikh. Has any such request been received (cf. paragraph 3 of Bahrain telegram October 7th No. 254)? If not and provided that you see no objection please explain His Majesty*s Government *s views to Shaikh and ascertain whether he agrees with proposal to make a protest at Teheran.2 Shaikh should also if you agree be advised to warn owners of dhows that such incidents are likely to occur and that in their own interests they should avoid calling in Persian ports as much as possible.Is?.. 1 ^ s |f x /9-A. ?f 1356 0: f fiis Adviser to no?

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah, K.C#I.E., C.S.I., has ordered me to address you on the subject of the recent dhow incident at Khorramshahr. 2* His Highness requests you to forward a strong protest through the usual diplomatic channels against the action of the Iranian Government which compelled the nakhuda of a Bahrain dhow, owned by a Bahrain subject and registered in the State of Bahrain, to deliver his ship’s registration documents, which he received from his Government, to the Iranian naval authorities and to accept in place of them Iranian —Iranian Government boat registration bearing the number, four. papers 3 * His highness regards this action as unjustified and hostile and he wishes it to be clearly understood that the surrender of Bahrain registration documents and accept ance of Iranian papers by the nakhuda of the Bahrain boat was the result of unjustified compulsion on the part of the Iranian authorities and cannot be regarded as being of any political significance whatever.

I understand that this letter was written actually before i had taken action on your telegram referred to above, and for this reason it is perhaps worded in a man ner somewhat different from what might have been expected as a result of the explanation which I gave of the views of His Majesty's Government on the nature of the protest to be made. Nevertheless, it is fully realised by His Highness the Shaikh that the protest which His Majesty's Government are prepared to make on his behalf is purely ox a formal nature and X do not, therefore, consider it necessary to invite the Adviser to recast the form of this letter.
