Dated 14th February 1930. 1 am strongly opposed to proposal which I think would inevitably lead to similar requests from Bin Saud and Persians and agree that it would react on question of Persian Agent at Bahrein, 111925 Persians proposed to appoint Persian subject residing in Kuwait as honorary Agent to issue passports to fellow subjects in Kuwait. They were informed that appointment of Persian representative even in honorary capacity would be contrary to Kuwait agre mient of 1399 and that any dei'ogation in favour of Persia would create embarrassing precedent in event of other Powers desiring to appoint representatives (vide Teheran’s despatch 110 3rd July 1 25 to you). Ultimately it was decided despite Shaikh’s opposition that Political Agent should give good offices to Persians, and it has been held that Iraq nation- , -als are also entitled to his protection ( vide your i Vletler No. 194-N of 3rd September 1926 to Bushire) f The Shaikh would certainly object strongly to the proposed ^appointment: his administration though run on primitive ^ lines is satisfactory: Iraqis are Already entitled to ^ good offices and I believe their number is inconsiderable but Political Agent is making further enquiries on this point. For the above reasons I suggest that similar reply should be given to Iraq as was given to Persian Gov- ^5 -eminent in 1925.

' ' ) : &gt; l 2. Mr. Secretary 3enn agrees with the views expressed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and by the Government of India. It seem almost in-evitable that acceptance of the proposal of the Iraq Governmeiit would lead, as Colonel Biscoe points out, to similar requests from Ibp Saud and from Persia, and its re actions on the question of a Persian Agent in Bahrain might also be unfortunate. Mr. Benn would suggest, in these circumstances, that, subject to any observations which the Foreign Office may have to offer, Sir Francis Humphrys should be instructed to reply to the Iraq Government*on the lines followed in paragraph 4 of Sir P. ® , Moraine's Note of 3rd July 1925 to tne Persian Government of which a c ox^y is enclosed. It may, of course, be added that the Political Agent, Koweit, will continue, as heretofore, to give his good offices to Iraquis. 3. Copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office.

I 11/' Sir, I an directed by Mr Secretary Henderson to inform you that he has heen furnished with a copy of India office letter So. | &gt; 1222/30 of S^th February co your department, regarding the proposal of the Iraqi Government to appoint an iraqi Vice-Consul at Kuwait. 2. While Mr Henderson concurs generally in the view, expressed in that letter, that this proposal should not be agreed to, since its acceptance would almost inevitably lead, as Colonel Biscoe has pointed out, to similar requests being put forward by ibn Saud and by .Persia, and since it might further produce an unfortunate reaction on the question of the appointment of a Persian Agent an Bahrain, he doubts whether the form of reply, which the India Office suggest should now be made to the Iraqi Goverrament, would altogether meet the case. 3o Uncer the Agreement of January 23rd, 1899, the Shaikh of Kuwait pledged himself and his heirs ana successors not to receive the Agent or representative of any power or Government at Kuwait without the previous sanction of His Majesty T s Government. it appears to Mr Henderson that it was primarily with a view to obtaining such sanction that the Iraqi Government originally approached His Majesty*s Govern^ ment in the natter, and that merely to reply by referring the Iraqi Government to the terms of the Agreement will hardly constitute a sufficient explanation of why such sanction must be withheld. HE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE, COLONIAL OFFICE.4» In these circumstances i am to suggest for Lord j^assfield* consideration that it would he preferable that b’ir Humphrys should oe instructed to explain to the Iraqi Government that there are at present no foreign Consular representatives in Kuwait, and that His Majesty’s Government are not prei^ared to agree, in accordance with the provisions of their Agreement with the Shalith of 1899, to sanction the appointment of such foreign representatives, were they to agree to the appointment of an Iraqi Vice-Consul, it would be impossible for theili. to withhold their consent to the appoint ment of Consular officers in Kuwait b^r other -Powers, and, in these circumstances, they regret that it is not possible for them to make any exception in favour of iraq to the policy which they have hitherto followed in this matter. 5, A copy of this letter if being sent to the India Uffice. i am, Sir, Your obedient servant, SD/ G. w.

As these last, however, concern His Britannic Majesty 1 s Consul, Basrah, more than the Kuwait authorities, it is suggested that Your Excellency should approach the said British Consul in the matter and inform him of His Ex cellency the Shaikh T s wishes in the matter, and ask that he be so good as to excuse the Boys all passport fees as a V special case for their joqhey to Kuwait. 4.

Mutasarrif, Basrah made similar request to me and I replied that while Shaikh had no objection to visit of stehool teachers they should be careful to have British Consular visas on their passports. Personally I am against such visas being granted gratis as preferential treatment of this nature will only create precedent. Bor your information Shaikh feels somewhat nervous about this visit of teachers as well as that of Basrah Boy Scouts who are coming same time, he believes real object to be propaganda. PoliticalGopy of secret demi official letter No. 49 , dated the 16th March 1933, from the Political Agent, Kuwait to the special Service Officer, Basrah, Just a line to tell you that the Mutasarrif, Basrah recently (4.3.33.) asked for permission for the Ahul Khasib Boy Scouts to visit Kuwait at the end of March. Me follov/ed it up by asking for similar permission (25.3.33) for a party of Baghdad school masters to do the same thing. 2. An urgent telegraphic notification to the same effect came also through the Ambassador to me ( 15.3.33.) with the request that I should wire if there was any ob jection to the proposal. 3. The Shaikh, though nercous of their visits, has granted the necessary permission; though in the case of the teachers he has rightly insisted on their having their passports properly vised by the British Consular authorities 4. I don’t feel particularly happy about the arrival of these people as, from my experience the Iraq Government frequently uses their Boy Scouts and educational staff to forward their own propaganda. Just now there seems to be a recrudescen ce of the movement here, (emanating from Iraq, I think) to discredit the British and forward the pan Arab idea. 5. I am not sure whether Mutlaq al Sur and Filial al Mutairi are not also engaged in this form of propaganda in addition to keeping in touch with the Mutair and watch ing Asir events.

The Shaikh is writing to me of ficially on the subject as it looks very definitely like discrimination against Kuwait, Sven in Turkish times Arabs, from whatever country they came, were never prevented from buying land or house property in Iraq, The only occasion that I know of was the case of Shaikh Mubarak and his Baddaghiyeh Sstate, Copy, with compliments, to the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire,Copy of secret demi official letter N©.l/BS/ 54 , dated the 20th March 1953 from the Special Service 0 fficer&gt; Basrah to the Political Agent, Kuwait, OOO Poes the following information from an agent fit in with anything you have? 'Some seven days before Ibn Subah left Kuwait following A1 Riba T i f s visit Ibn Saud was camped at Khufaisa (said to be A1 Khufaisat Muhammari on the million sheet). From this camp he sent A 1 Ribai to Kuwait to ask Ibn Subah for 17,000 (whether rupees or liras, agent was unable to say). After the return of A 1 Riba T i, Ibn Saud moved to As Sala which is on the Lughf an Nafud one days journey a little east of ? J'ibli T from A1 Haba. At this camp he invited any of the leaders of the Mutair who had complaints to visit him but only one, Mi shari Ibn? chief of the town of Umbaiyidh, did so. Mishari was well received and after receiving largesse left for his home but died the following day. It is conjectured that he may have been poisened. Ibn Saud was camped at As Sala until 9 or 10 days ago (i.e. until the 9 th or 10 th March)', Another agent states n when I left Riyadh about the 14th February, Saud al Arafa was said to be with Shuwaish, Ibn Saud’s herdsman at Al Ibtaniyat - not far from Al Hafar' I am making further enquiries and will let you know anything I hear. Most of the above came originally from Lafi ibn Mu’ aliith who had it from relatives newly arrived at Kuwait. Lafi, as you probably know, is wanted by Ibn Saud (his brother is already in prison) and is now on his way to Baghdad. I hear that one Mansur Al Rumaih, an Agaili, is on his way to Kuwait, it is reliably reported that he is an agent of King Ali and is generally by the Bedouin as a little mad and a great liar.Translation of a D.O.letter No.2869 dated the 25th March 1933, from the Mutasarrif, Basrah Liwa, Basrah to His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait.

Sir, I have the honour to forward a translation of a leading article, which appeared in the Baghdad newspaper util, (Brothers of Homeland), under date 16th May 1933, 20th Moharram 1352. 2 . The paper in question, I believe is controlled by the party of Tfhich His Excellency Yasin Pasha is the head. 3. The article is an interesting example of the empla Aw ployed by IRAQ, in her steady attack on Kuwait; and is more subtle than the 'bull in the china shop' methods of Bin Saud, the other aspirant to Kuwait and her favours. ■4, Clearly IRAQ believes in threatening, and making herself unpleasant, so to speak, with her right hand, while offering peace and the olive branch with her leffc. This is a form of moral suasion well known among Arabs and the East generally* 5 . Thile I say it with caution, I should imagine the article tc be an insx^ired one, and forms another link in the chain of steady pressure, which lias been2 been and continues to b© brought to bear on the principality of Kuwait for obvious reasons. 6 , Nor should it be forgotten that the Shaikh of Kuwait, like most -astern Rulers, is especially susceptible to Newspaper attacks, whatever form they take. The present article bears a distinct resemblance to the very interesting ones, published by Ismail Hakicl, Deputy for Baghdad, which appeared in the Turkish news paper, ^Tanin' of December 24th, December 26th and December 28 th in 1910, vide Mr.Marfins despatch to the I. on * ble nir dated Jdward Grey, No. 15,/Constantinople, the 4th January 1911 f copies of which you will find, I think, in your Bushire archives. 8 .

They (Kuwaitians) long for Iraqian news and read her papers* Before they go through any article in the paper, they read the heading lest perhaps they might come across a thing written about Iraq, and when found, it is read before any other topic. The sound of telegrams is echoed in Kuwait in half an hour’s time, and letters reach there within four hours by post. Experience and the existing state of affairs hare both proved that Kuwait grieves at our sorrows, laughs at our happiness, and lives again on hearing of Iraq’s revival. Incidents have also taught us that this brotherly ^ as we have in those stormy daysdays and has borne her suf ferings as we hare. irirate and public news echo in Kuwait, the sound of Iraq’s complaints about the iniquity of the conrention - and her news told us, at the time, how the Kuwait ians groaned and were unhappy at our grief and sorrow. Their feelings are not of to-day or of yesterday, nay, they have existed for years long gone by, this lively feeling has been in existence amongst Kuweit f s Emirs and her townspeople ever since the formation of the principality under its prince the Al-Subah. This fellow feelingjis the outcome of common necessity and the sufferings of both parties. Family connections between us both are numerous. Each one is sufficient enough to unite and make of us one nation. Our relationship with this brotherly princedom is based on one religion, the same language, customs and man ners, in addition to the fact that we have one and the same aim in life, lastly geographically we stand the same. What the Kuwaiti says the Iraq understands, what the Iraq adopts the Kuwaiti follows, what is complained of by the Iraqi, is likewise complained of bitterly by the Kuwaiti. Were we to unite and join together we would become a power that could not be repulsed, seeing that we have determination to claim our rights. Our brethem the Kuwaitians have experienced certain incidents that have happened quite re cently and now know that separation from us is undesirable, they have discovered that had they been a part of a strong government with her aeroplanes, army and fighting equipment they would not have suffered such a heavy casualty roll and loss of so many youths, within the very walls of Kuwait whilst defending the Emirate. Th^s, our nation now feels it necessary to support and aid her brother the Kuwaitian. Iraq/- 3 - Iraq and her people feel that to come and defend the Kuwaiti an can no longer be avoided. This feeling first had its inception in the brains and the hearts, but now the time for action has ccstie. The Iraq Nation would be blameworthy, were It not to render a helping hand, and com bine her efforts with those of her brother. Readers remember that the recent visit paid by Eis Excellency Shaikh Ahmed El Jabir to his great capital, Baghdad. His Excellency very well remembers how the Iraqians met and welcomed him, and if that reception has left a good V\J impression on him I would add one more thing, gamely that if His Excellency cares to open the hearts of Iraqians, young and old, he will see nothing but deep admiration for him. Although it is only recently that His Excellency has been chosen to sit on the throne of this princedom, yet wonderful progress has already been made in his town and among his people. It is also known to us how His Excellency longs to seize the opportunity for strengthening the relationship between the two countries by intermarriages between Kuwatis and Iraqis, thereby uniting the two, so that the Customs barrier, founded by the 'dlyidlnK' foreigner should be onoe for all removed, also that differences and passpofit formalities should be done away with, resulting in the flags of both nations being hoisted side by side on build ings and palaces, and so enabling the Arabs to leap the first harrier that prevents progress and prosperity. - oO o—•— - lNo* 186.

I gather the article was inspired by the Shaikh, who himself drew my attention to it* lie also told me the name of the man who sent it.

My supposed thanks and grateful remarks to H.M’s Charge d’Affaires and the Iraq Prime Minister really reflects the Shaikh’s own feelings for he was most pleased when I told him of my interview with the Prime Minister and was deeply touched, when I delivered Rachid Ali Qnilani’s message about the Fao Estates.

He received the following reply:- 'Kuwait. His Excellency Ahmed as-Subah. Thank you, I wish you a successful future'. Faisal. The two messages which have been exchanged between H.M. the King of Iraq, the great leader of the Arabs, and His Excellency the Amir of Kuwait, are positiTe proof of the great and reciprocal friendship which exist between the Arabs' King and their .Amirs. When the Hashemi passenger left Baghdad for the -.nglish Metropolis in compliance with the invitation of the King Emperor, His Excellency our Amir took great interest in his movements, and all along hoped that success and pleasure would attend the visit of the King and his good companions. His Excellency felt the greatest deligkt and joy whenever he read the news regarding the banquets, etc., that were given in HisHis Majesty’s honour in the Anglo-Saxon capital. If Lis Excellency takes such interest in the movements of H.M. Faisal the First, the saviour, and in the future of our Arab hopes, and he is outstanding in this respect, then we pray that his efforts may be crowned with success and bliss at all times. Hi® Excellency Colonel H.B.P, Dickson, the British olitical Agent at Kuwait, left for Baghdad by one oi the Imperial Airways’ aeroplanes on a private and important matter, and His Excellency returned to Kuwait by one of the same company’s planes. His Excellency was treated as a special guest during his stay in Baghdad, both by the Prime Minister, B*t, Beshid All Beg al-Kailani, and H.I3. the acting British Ambassador, and is grateful for the kind welcome and hospitality wbc&amp;h he received . He also thanks his hosts for the facilities given him in accomplishing his important work.

We do not regard it as too much from the Kail any and his friends the Iraqi s if they on all occasions show their affection and respects for the Ai as-Subah, because these brave men are the leaders of the Arab New World and are its chiefs.

Perhaps it was one of those 'Keys” of communications which hastened on the great war, the flames of which as we know devoured the green with the dry. It, however, cannot escape the notice ? those who keep a close study on the remarkable rise of this Arab State, that most of the treaties, which have been concluded between certain statesmen, with regard to the route to India, the safety of the British Empire and the liberty of trade and navigation in the Gulf have been greatly influenced by the position of this State, it being situated at a junction of routes and capable of being turned into a strategical strong-hold provi ding power and supplies. Mow that the atmosphere has become clear, and the heavy clouds have disappeared from the horizon of political struggle, certain business men of financial and econo leal standing, have approached the Ruler of the State, His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as~Subah, with a view to get a concession for thethe development of oil, which, according to the reports of geologists, Is abundant in his state, and they are now after a great deal of competition, making final represen tations to the Ruler for the uncovering of the natural treasures which lie hidden under the ground of that State. The above competition, it appears, has reached the final stages, the two oil companies, being amongst the greatest oil companies of the world, namely the Iraq Petrol Company on the one side, and the Company as represented by Lord Seymesa on the other. The bidding between the rivals will shortly be brought to a conclusion by the announce- iaent of the naia® of one of the two companies as the winning party that is to develop the natural tresures of the State* Seeing that huwait is likely to become very important in the oil world, and understanding the bright and promising future which lies before it, the British Government have decided to make it the centre of their policy in the Gulf by moving their Political Residency from its old position in Bushire, , jbh® to the Principality of Kuwait* The Political Resident, or, more precisely, the head of all Political Agents in the Gulf Ports, has already arranged for the construction of a large and excellent building for his residence on the sea-shore in Kuwait, for which more than one million bricks have up to date been transported from Basrah, and which has provided work for many masons and labourers, femx&amp;fe both in Kuwait and Basra* As we see this strong development in the direc tion of Kuwait, and witness its effect on the progress of that State, which indeed gives us very great pleasure to record, w© can also perci^ve the kindly feelings which His Excellency the Ameer (the Shaikh of Kuwait) bears his brethren the people of Iraq, as shown in the rec nt faci lities accorded by him to an Xraqian Company for thethe establishment of a company in umit under the name of the 'Kuwait Electrification Company', as well as the patronage and encouragruaent which he has given it. All this gives us a clear picture of the powerful influences which are at work to link that State, morally and spiritually with its Sister the Iraq. Someday, it may^be that Kuwait will be joined with Iraq both politicajly and economically* Pray God that this may happen in the near future. The aboveraentioned Company having received the necessary patrohage and assistance from His Excellency the Ameer (the Shaikh of Kuwait), attempted to give satisfaction by providing Kuwait with electric current at an early date, the idea being to make it the bride of the Gulf, after it had acquired a high position in the world of economics. The near future will no doubt disclose k© us its Importance in matters commercial, as well as prove the good prospects that await the State in the field of business and economics* We reveal no secret, when we say that the increase which has occurred in the size of the popula tion of the State during the last five years, and the large buildings which have been constructed, not to speak of the establishment of great companies^xsf branch offices in Kuwait, all leads us to believe that the projects which are being undertaken there will succeed. Moreover the successful progress of the Iraq-Kuwait Company (the Kuwait Electrification Co.) contributes to this our belief, and makes us hopeful and expectant. As we write this, we feel pity for the large ^vter of unemployed youths of Baghdad who are unaware jtcJ*. rich Stats near them and are neglecting the of their close relationship to it: a relation- \ by blood, religion, proximity and business \ ^-^rdb^es the youth of Iraq to join their otherother home, Kuwait. Kuwait indeed is in dire need of persons who can promote the standard of education in it, for youth to add their efforts to those of their colleague, in Kuwait, and lastly for youth to emigrate and become a lasting link between the youth of Iraq and the youth of Kuwait. The benefits which would result from such an ausx4.clous movement are too great to be defined. His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, who is well known for his patronage to learning, and who bears for this country (Iraq) a sincere and hearty affection which had been proved by his last visit to his other heme the Iraq, will no doubt regard this our essay with the encouraging look of a man who desires to take advantage of such sti^ong oonneetions and hopes to make of Iraq and wait a united country linked together by their common interests of blood, religion and neighbourhood. {Signed) Al-Muhallab.vC CONFIDENTIAL.

I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of an enquiry which I have received from the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the date of the institution of Kuwaiti and Bahraini nationality. This is a question of some complexity and I have thought it well to consult you before making a reply. 2. In the Anglo-Turkish Agreement signed in July 1913 the Ottoman Government renounced all claims to Bahrain but retained suzerainty over the territory of Kuwait. This Agreement was not ratified and I assume, therefore, that its provisions cannot be held ever to have become operative. 3 . If this is so, the inhabitants of both Kuwait and Bahrain remained technically Ottoman subjects until the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne on 6 th August, 1924, when, under the provisions of Article 3, both States were finally and completely detached from Turkey. From that date, under Article 30, the inhabitants of these detached territories became 'nationals of the State to which such territory is transferred 1 *. Hence it would appear that the date of the creation of both Kuwaiti and Bahraini nationality is the date on which the Treaty of Lausanne came into force. /4. No. 739.

Had this been effected, Kuwait, in view of its excellent geographical position, would have became a first rate sea port and harbour for f Iraq; and Kuwait and ♦Iraq together would have derived equal advantage at one and the mm time* However, Kuwait has now got a good and direct coimection in the I osts and Telegraphs Service, which la being carried on in Kuwait by the latter* The people of Kuwait theme elves desire vary sincerely that they should be annexed to ♦Iraq and the present ruler of Kuwait, we bellve, approves of this annexation also, because it will disentangle him frou many difficulties, which arise frequently between him and Nejd on the question of the 'Muaabalah” and the &amp;wmn(i$.

However, being as I am* ardently and ever desirous to preserve good and friendly relations with my neighbours in general* and with * Iraq in particular* I should be grateful if you would kindly draw the attention of those concerned, to the boastful newspaper articles which we are wont to frequently read nowaday© in * Iraqian newspapers and which under prominent and sensational headlines seem bent on disturbing the friendly and amicable relations which exist between neighbours.

In the above mentioned article the writer has dealt with this supposed annexation idea in a manner rhich reveals an attempt at pure pro;&gt;oeande obviously with the evil purpose of prostituting the true facta, and sowing the seeds of hatred between our ad joining countries* Had such writings as these reached us from beyond the c-cao, or from far distant countries, we should have not been very surprised; but the constant publishing of these wicked and scurrilous articles in the press of ’Iraq causes us the greatest astonishment* How is it possible for responsible men in organised government like that of ’Iraq to allow certain Individuals, who have no idea of truth, to try and traduce the good name of their neighbours and insult them without reason? Our intention, however, is not to discover the motive or object underlying these writings, but rather to make protest and show our contempt for methods which we cannot pass over in silence, whoever the real author may be* Lastly the ppearance of such falsa/inspired stories written by an ’Iraqi at one t Ire and by a Syrian at another compel us to protest most strongly against the writer and with deep insistence we would ask that you kindly write to the proper authorities concerned, and request them to bring such vicious propaganda to an end, and thus presefv© the spirit of frinedahip which we above ail wish should continue* Usual indlng*4 - for eonwfitentt* of reference 1, hm&lt;t the mmmM&amp;Bt Wrn% th# Wm% -Sr«otorat&lt;f # Xmw&amp;k* already control?!

A merchant from Basra writes in th£ n Saut-al- Sha f b ft newspaper as follows w Smuggling is one of the worst blights that have befallen ’Iraq, in the last few years. It has caused much harm to souls and property. The T Iraq G-overnment will never be able to exterminate this dangerous pestilence, whose roots have become deeply fixed in the soil of f Iraq, a no matter how great their efforts and persistence or how clever their methods be. Tho only way to abolish this pestilence is to radically reduce the customs duties and bring then down to a level that will make smugglers aetivites an unpaying proposition. If the 'Iraq Govern- ment will/admit of or yield to this solution, they will never succeed in the suppression of this destructive movement. d The Customs Department in 'Iraq have been paralyze&lt; in the last few years. Their resources have dried up, and their income has greatly diminished. Yet smuggling parties still traverse the desert in great numbers, and make their way to the land of 'Iraq in safety. They have moreover managed by their daring to reach the most northern limits of the country carrying their contraband. In con sequence the merchants and traders of 'Iraq are suffering great losses which it is difficult to make up for. if conditions remain as they are, the -r oe of Iraq will inevitably suffer a tremendous setback. During the last forty days only, forty thousand bags and packages of sugar (soft and loaf) including tea entered the Port of Kuwait, while not even one tenth of thisthis amount entered rhe Port of Basra, The business of carrying these commodities from Kuwait (to be smuggled into ’Iraq) is brisk, and the merchants of Kuwait are enjoying wealth and luxury, while the merchants cf 1 Iraq are on the contrary suffering and watching this business with any eye of despondency and despair* The ’Iraq Government may allege that customs are their only source of revenue in ’Iraq, and that any reduc tion in same might bring bankruptcy on the Government, They never think of the great gifts which they bestow in abundance on the nomads spread all over the desert, and of the innocent souls exposed to death at any moment, though it is well knowntha t casua lties on bo th sides are ’Iraqis * Smugglers of necessity are driven towards danger and death by the natural desire of acquiring the large profits that ac crue from the trade. On the other hand were the ’Iraq Government to reduce her customs tariffs, imports would increase, the trade of ’Iraq would revive, well-being and prosperity would came to most of the merchants of ’Iraq, and the lives of many ’Iraqis would be spared* Another suggestion is that the ’Iraq Government should ouen negotiations with the Shaikh of Kuwait for the conclusion of a treaty in which the latter should undertake to block up all smuggling activities. This she can achieve at a little cost, hut it will enable her to root out this menacing traffic, and its advantages will be far greater than the price paid. The British Government, if they wished, could easily persuade the Shaikh of Kuwait, who is in their hands and dare not contradict them, of the truth of this suggestion. Practice has prewed that the Shaikh of Kuwait is not endowed with sufficient pov^r to resist the projects of the British Government. It will be more so in the case of ’Iraq Customs which are in their tight grasp, and whichand which are controlled by British advisers; for the Director of Customs at Basra, and probably at the capital also inflicts fines and penalties according to his wish and whim. The merchants of Basra have lodged many/complaint protesting against his misuse of authority, to several suc cessive cabinets, yet ho remains unshaken in power, perhaps he will claim more than this. If our ally, the British Government, will support our real demands, which can be summarized in the words The Annexation of Kuwait to ’Iraq”, Kuwait will also great ly improve. Kow it is lagging behind in every phase of its life. There is no culture, no learning of any sort, no liber -ty etc., etc., in the principality. Should Kuwait be annexed to ’Iraq, the accruing fruit will be great, especial ly in demolishing the ignorance and illiteracy prevailing there. Why, well to do persons in Kuwait actually send their children to the schools of ’Iraq today. This indeed implies that Kuwait is in dire need of culture and learning. Iraqis do not desire to benefit economically at the expense of Kuwait. On the contrary merchants of Kuwait will be able to buy landed properties in ’Iraq, and thus invest their monies in its markets without the need of obtaining permits as they do now. We are confident that the most educated people of Kuwait will and do agree with us in our ideas, and wish that they be soon brought into effect. We do not think that there is anything to hinder such union, as the population of both countries are Arabs and Mohammedans; we except the question of Sheikhdom, which in our opinion, is the only obstacle in the way of this union, fith the good will of both sides it will not be difficult to find out a solution for same.S.W. 1. P.Z.8361/33. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, 6th March 1934. jMy dear George, You sent us under your printed letter of 28th December, No. S.7589/7589/91, copy of a despatch from Baghdad on the subject of an Iraqi enquiry as to the date of institution of Koweiti and Bahreini nationality. I am afraid that owing to pressure of more urgent questions disposal of this has been delayed and that even now we are not in a position to give very much assistance. 2. Humphrys suggests in his despatch that the inhabitants of both Koweit and Bahrein, for reasons which he gives, remained technically Ottoman subjects until the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne and that on this basis the date of creation of both Bahreini and Koweiti nationality is the date on which the Treaty of Lausanne came into force. 3. I doubt, however, if the position is, in fact, quite so simple. It is quite true that in the case of Bahrein/ if. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign office, S.W. 1. ' • '- 8 - Bahrein the Ottoman Government withdrew their claim to suzerainty in the unratii'ied Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913. But we had never recognised this claim, any more than we have recognised Persian claims, and we should, I imagine, he justified in maintaining (and it would indeed oe desirable to maintain) that we had consistently dealt V with Bahrein as an independent State, possibly from so remote a date as our Treaty of 1820. On that assumption the importance of the Convention of 1913 would be merely that it represented a formal abandonment by Turkey of claims to which we had never assented - an abandonment similar to that which we hope to secure from Persia in the proposed General Treaty with her. 4. Koweit is more difficult. We gave the Sheikh of Koweit an undertaking on the 3rd November 1914 that Koweit would be recognised as ’’an independent principality” under British protection. Humphrys is, I think, probably technically correct in maintaining that tho date of the creation of a Koweiti nationality consequent on this assurance is the date on which the Treaty of Lausanne came into force. Gn the other hand, as you know, we have been anxious to give as little prominence as possible to the/3 the position of Koweit as a portion of the former Turkish Empire in the interests of avoiding any effort, e.g. hy the United States Government, to claim that they had inherited capitulatory rights in Koweit (you will remember that this specific point has been very present to us in connection with the revision of the Koweit Order in Council), and if on any ground it was possible to antedate the creation of Koweiti nationality to, e.g. our assurance of 1914 there would, I think, be much on general grounds to be said for this. 5. The above represent our provisional views. But the points involved seem to me to be much more matters for expert legal advice in the Foreign Office than for the India Office. At the same time we are, of course, closely interested in the Question oi the reply to oe given, and I venture to suggest that you might care to consider it further in the Foreign Office and give us an opportunity of commenting before any instructions actually issue to Baghdad.

Apparently Major Holmes has known Mr.Yusuf ^rhanima far some years, and happened to be in Basra when the latter recently paid a visit to that iovai. 5. According to Major Holmes, Mr. Yusuf Ghanima, ^ hearing that his friend was in Basra, sent for him and enquired whether he, Major Holmes, on behalf of the Kuwait Oil Company or some of his American j. riends, could no t rAnnAction in the southern part his way to apply for an Oil Concession in of Iraq (Basra Liwa)* 4. Major Holmes replied jokingly that neither he ..or any other self-respecting company wanted to have anythme t0 do with the Basra area, as there was no sign of Oil there. further 'Oil' talk, Yusuf Ghanima turned 5.

He next touched on . whi ch /- 2 - which Iraq, had gained for herself in having managed to get Kuwait Post &amp; Telegraph arrangements in her hands, and hoped that it would not be long before Iraq got a Railway line through to Kuwait. This last he regretted he oould put through at present, as money was tight, hut he hoped at some later date that it would be his good fortune to inaugurate a service. /hen the time came for this however, he hoped and trusted that the Shaikh would have got rid of some of his nonsensical ideas about independence and would have learnt 'which side his bread was buttered on' f . 7. Major Holmes said that he could not say why he was regaled with the above, but suspected that the game was to get him to do a little bit of 'propaganda' for Iraq with the Shaikh. What Major Holmes did not like however, was the contemptuous way with which the Finance Minister all the time referred to 'little Kuwait and her Shaikh' - As Major Holmes put it, 'Anyone hearing Mr.Yusuf Ghanima might easily have supposed that Kuwait was a miserable little village on the - borders of Iraq and her Shaikh a petty chieftain with a lot V. of wind in the head'. 8. Major Holmes said that his ta.U with the iniote lasted nearly two hours. 9.

After leaving Kuwait on the morning of the 23th July I reached Basra safely at about 9 A.M. and took the mail train for Kerbella the same evening* I visited the shrines in Kerbella in the morning next day and proceeded by car to Nejef in the evening* I passed the night in Nejef and visited Koofa also. Next day morning I came back to Kerbella and after a stay of 2 hours I travelled by car to Baghdad reaching the latter place at 11 A.M. I utilized every minute that I had at my disposal and went round Baghdad seeing almost all important places. I left Baghdad on the 31 st and arrived Basra on the 1st. During my short stay in Iraq I am glad I saw many things and I met many people. You will be interested to hear that it is not only the high authority and officials who accuse Kuwait of snuggling etc* but it appears to be a general belief throughout Iraq* Almost everyone I met asked me many questions about the smuggling which they believed to be going on from Kuwait to Iraq on a large scale. They were probably given to understand that almost av-ry imp thing imported into Iraq comes through Kuwait only, as much as it ?/as possible for me to say I explained the things to the enquirers and told them that Kuwait was quite innocent in this affair as she took no part nor took any shares in the profits made by smugglers. They could blame their own people who found it a profitable busine to bring things from outside Iraq. Kuwaitis were engaged in a legitimate trade and they sold their things to those who came to buy it. They also said that during the recent tribal troubles Kuwait did not play a fair gtme and supplied arms and amminitions to the rebels. I told them that it was a news for me as I never heard of such things as arms and ammunition to be available in Kuwait for the purpose • a “fY ere was strict embargo on importation of arms into ^t State and the Ruler showed his good regard icr ^ ll ® Iraq by allowing none to take out any kind of arms from Kuwait.

Hot only are the articles highly objectionable from the Kuwait point of view, but as far as I can see they have been written with the deliberate purpose (a) of undermining the authority of the .jhaikh of Kuwait with his people. (b) Bringing into disrepute the good intentions and policy of His Majesty’s Government towards the Arab states of the Gulf. (o)U) Arousing the young people of Kuwait to a sense of their supposed, danger from the machiavellian policy of His Majesty’s Government, and teaching them that their eventual salvation lies: in union with Iraq, (d) Presenting a glowing picture to young Kuwait patriots of a future union of all Arab States into one great and indivisible Arab Nation under the aegis of Iraq - a grand conception for immature minds. 5 * Kt the same time the articles, especially that headed n C tf , offers the very subtle suggestion to the Shaikh, that if he falls into line with the 'Union” idea, he will not only rehabilitate himself in Arab eyes, but will in actual fact gain in prestige and importance, seeing that his local independence will be assured, he will be safe from foreign aggression, and with the high title of 'His Highness' (to be conferred on him) will feel that he has saved his country from absorption by England, (a non-Muslim State) and gained peace, progress and tranquility for himself and. his people under the protective wings of Mother IRAQ. 6. There is the still more subtle suggestion that His Majesty’s Government intends to declare a protectorate over Kuwait, showing that the writer knows how greatly such a suggestion would upset the Ruler of Kuwai t and his people if taken seriously (as it easily mifdit be if the seed falls on good ground). 7. That the articles are highly objectionable, and are liable to do great harm, I think will be patent to you, and I would suggest that necessary steps be taken to draw the attention of the Iraq Government to this form of unfriendly and unfair propaganda.

The youngmen of Kuwait have recently presented a petition to the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in which they expressed their aspiration and desire to be united with Iraq. They said in their petition, that conditions in Kuwait did not agree with the keen desire felt by the people for introduc ing into their country the method s of modern civilization. It seems, however, that British policy aims at utlizing the bad state of affairs in Kuwait to bring that oountry under her direct control, as has been the case in Bahrain. It is said also that the (British) plan of uniting the Persian Gulf Pirates into a sort of Confederation, which was shown up by the Press some two years ago, has today been raised again.

The idea of union between the State of Kuwait and its rising neighbour,the Kingdom of 'Iraq, is one of very long standing. The people of Kuwait indeed crave for such union, not because they hate their rulers who have always been kind to them, but because they recognize the great advantages that their country will derive following such a union; and they appreciate the necessity for greater solidarity among Arab nations, in this age of economic progress, when it will be impossible for small territories, and a divided nation to survive unless they one and all are re-united ami fused together by means of one crucible.

Further the posts and Telegraphs Service has already been unified in the two countries, with much advantage to both, Neverthless if both countries were to be wholly united, the result would be Entirely admirable: For f Iraq would benefit from the natural position of Kuwait, seeing that the latter is a good seaport; and Kuwait for her part would benefit from the introduction of a proper administration, the deveiopement of education, and improved trade, seeing that present restric tions between the two countries would then be abolished. Moreover, such union will be the focus point or nucleus of the great Arab empire, which all Arab peoples are endeavour ing to attain, a movement which has become so important as to be recognized by Arab kings and rulers, who have commenced singing its praises and trying to realize it, X The offer to join Kuwait with f Iraq by the A1 Sabah dynasty would be a new and remarkable service to the future Arab nation. Nay it will surpass all others that have gone l*S~ befora.

And last but not least the *«BDex*/sons also could be appointed to hold high positions under the Government of ’Iraq. The late Shaikh Mubarak has already in the Ottoman period, borne the title of Qaim-Maqam. This designation, however, did not prevent the Emir Mubarak froxa oeing n very good raler who always strove to promote the welfare of his country. Likewise the conferring of the title of His Highness on the present Emir, in place of the unimportant one of Shaikh of Kuwait, a British protected town, and the fact that the State had taken refuge under the’Iraqi Arab standard, would afford a unique opportunity for His Highness the finir to serve the/ l iij I K •1ii I V 111 V I | | v | i ' \ .13 Tyf the rest of Arabia, with his high endowments, , and to co- operate with the kings and leaders of the other Arab countrie ihe ruler of uwai t as well as the people are all men who put great store on their nationality and their reli gion f and cannot possibly prefer foreign protection to the bonds of nationality and religion.

Such union would bring about better understanding between Arab countries, and would offer no opportunity to ^ foreigners to interfere in the settlement of the differences between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on the question of 'Musabal^, or any other questions, on the ground ttiat Kuwait was under British protection. The state of anxiety and confusion now prevailing in europe, calls for deep thinking as to what will be the eventual fate of Arab countries should 1hey continue in ulieir present attitude.

Sir, In continuation of my Confidential letter No. 0-269, dated the 5th September 193 5, I have the honour to forward the two further articles which have appeared in the Iraq vernacular papers, as under:- 'A” Translation of an article which appeared in the newspaper n AL IRAQ* under date 19th August 19 35. ttg' ditto ditto which appeared in the ,f AL BILAD” newspaer under date 26th August 19o5. 2 . I have little to add to the remarks passed by me in my previous letter under reference but article 'B' xs interesting and Illuminating as it comes from the famous Egyptian newspaper the Muaattam, a reliable daily which we may liken to the ••Times' in the Middle Bast. 3 You will note that the writer of the article openly «... .. mv. »«»** “* ““ ’ rlr, “ 1 . in veiled fashion that Kuwait British possessions, ana n her independence still may be the next to which has preserved hex go into the Lion T s maw. 4 .

As these and the previous articles which I sent you, have had the worst possible effect in Kuwait, I would, with deep respect, suggest, and provided you see no objection to such course, that the articles now sent you together with those enclosed in my despatch No.0-269 be forwarded on to His Majesty* s Government, even though His Majesty’s Charge* d*Affaires in Baghdad appears to have already taken some action with H.E.Yasin Pasha, and with satisfactory results, vide paras 3 and 4 of British Bmbassy’s despatch No.451, dated the 20th August 19 35, to the Bight Hon’ble Bir Samuel Hoare,Bt., G.O.S.I., G.B.E., etc. etc. (copy of which was sent to me under your Printed Letter No.694-S of 6th September). 6. The reason why I venture to make the above sug gestion is that H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait’s recent visit to England may be said to be bound up with and to have been undertaken largely as a result of this pernicious propaganda, n*- which has been going against his &amp;tate in Iraq for a very considerable time now. 7 # There seems little doubt in my mind that both the Shaikh and his people believed in July lest that His Majesty's Government were weakening, as a result of the Iraq Government’s calculated and persistent attacks in the matter of ’•smuggling', and that Kuwait was in eminent danger ofJbeing surrendered to Iraq, or of being brought under His Majesty’s Government's direct control, which the xraq Government’s proposal to appoint a British Director of Customs, restrict her imports etc. etc. was understood to mean. the verv life and existence of To the Shaikh and his people the very 11 a Ajrab State was in danger and he Kuwait as an independent Aral ... ... ^ in, “ mon I l iWf* it- 2 - 8* lliat *Uie bhaikh is now believed to have been successful in his mission to London, may be guaged from the truly remarkable and amazing reception which was given him on his return to Kuwait when, as already reported to you by telegram, thousands of Bedouin came in frcrn distances of over a 100 miles to welcome him, and fully 25,000 townsmen (excluding a deacnsti*ation of 2000 women who met him inside the city gates) collected on the aerodrome to shake hands with him. Here in spite of the efforts of over 300 armed policemen and fidawis, the crowd broke bonds, and surged round the reception shed set apart for the Shaikh and strove to shake hands with him or embrace him. Fully 5000 weeping and hysterical persons actually reached the Shaikh and wrung his hands, before it was found possible to get him into his car and drive him away. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant,Translation of an article from the 'Al-Iraa' newspaper of Baghdad, No # 595Q, dated the 19th August 1935. KUWAIT ON THE CROSSROADS. IT IS N0$ TIMS FOR REFORMATION,OR ARE THE PEOPLE STILL DOSING IN THEIR INDOLENCE? I was the first person to hear of the proposal which the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presented to His Highness Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir as Sabah before the latter packed off for the British Capital - the proposal which urged the necessity for i©forming the situation in Kuwait by re-organizing its Government under the supervision of the British advice. Indeed, I was the first person to hear of this important news; and the way I heard it admitted of no doubt in the truth of it. I, however, did not liice then to make it public, out of pity for the name of an Arab country which we regret to see compelled by a foreign power to refom its o® affairs. Those at the helm ought of their own accord to carry out „ as no t to leave room for any political the reformation, so as nuu aspirant to achieve his ends. ... «... *&gt;&gt;«“ •“ &lt; ’ h 1 “ e ” 1 ”‘ to h.s .PP.«.4 1» «&gt;. o, K„.» to. top, -to., » to. r-pop, - -to „ - to. »« — *° a “‘ r . but to put in my wcrd on this serious it. I have no choice but v .i history of Kuwait. 1 am particularly event in the politic- d t mv readers know, ona first person2 - fLU seriously, and wrote a great, a Tary great deal In oonneotion with the necessity of reforming the affairs am resources of Kuwait. The result of my writings, however, appears to have had no effect whatsoever. In 19£8 there arose in Kuwait a progressive nation al spirit, kindled by unique intelligence, and enhanced by diligent reading of newspapers and magazines. The youth of Kuwait then had a voice which resounded throughout the Arabian world, and on which most of the leading Arab newspapers made comments - a voice which demanded reforms, and lamented the negligence of those in power.Those who read newspapers were aware that there were Kuwaiti writers,whose pens had a good press in the col mans of Iraqi newspapers. Among all,however, this paper was the leader. She carried the torch of reform ation, and was a resort for Kuwaiti free-thinkers, and in her columns were published the products cf their pens, which caus ed hearts to bleed and made not only the mercilul but also every hax*d-hearted man to shed tears. That auspicious movement went on for some years, and people hoped that it would bring the beet of results to the State of Kuwait, which Nature has endowed with a unique position In Arabia, and whose importance will shortly emerge. Moreover, the abatement toned movement rose just after the accession of Shaikh iJimad who was famous ter his sympu-hj for reformation, and for his hitter criticism of those in power, because they were leading Kuwait in her ruin. Ill luck, however, refused to leave Kuwait, and , t „»iTrioi n pl target for those who have insisted that it should remain a .arfeev . and for those who try to ambitions and ends to achieve, aj fill their pockets except fish in turbid water, and cannot fill . + cmf* anarchy prevails.Sovery soon the when disorder exists end anareuy or persecuted. Some of them reformers were driven ^ «. to leave their country, and others indeed were coupeH®d t „ ,1 virds of trouble. Newspaper readers were suffered of all kinds ^ writers were warned that they must very badly treated, and writers i '«L ; ’•m i'they must oease from writing anything in the Iraq Press. The 'Al Iraq” newspaper was banned from Kuwait, and punishments were inflicted upon those who smuggled it into Kuwait. Thus and by such means the plan was laid to Kill the reform movement in Kuwait* In this the plan to a certain degree succeeded, although its after effects were pernicious to Kuwait - a fact which suggests itself to everyone who possesses the power of thinking. Ay2 the reform movement in Kuwait received its coup d© grace and fell a victim to shameful ignorance. Upon her grave, reformers shed tears of blood, and their lamentation was deep — That was because she died, or to put it more clearly, was killed at a time when the whole world was racing in the course of progress by leaps and bounds in tbe same way that electricity was taking the place of other forms of power. Accordingly, Kuwait has remained standing in its bedouin mentality, bereft from reforms both in her administra- tion and in education. As to the disorder that prevails in an diairate whose state of affairs is such: as to the distress that comes as an inevitable result of such a state of affairs these both are matters which we need not bother to substantiate or comment on. „ h «5 well as other writers, who We were afraid indeed as wex-i. a .^ ... ... px»= -WO- «• “• ^ . im, e blow has fallen, and I say so with lately unfolded* .

This is my sincere advice which I solemnly offer to His Highness the Bmlr of Kuwait, and am all confidence that he will be so wise as to avoid the peril of foreign tyranny, into which Bahrain has already fallen, and for which she suffered, in Major Daly’s time, the most terrible and distressing results. s' i !

That, they maintain, was the real cause of the Emir’s journey. The Emir travelled to Baghdad and proceeded to Mosul and Nesibin, from where he took the Orient Express to Europe via Istanbul. It is, however, understood that ‘Hie Amir during his stay at London, saw a specialist about a disease he had in his mouth; and that ho also met certain members of the Government who received him with honour and sincere pleasure, as is their custom with all prominent visitors to their country.

Nevertheless, in 19S3 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, deposed the ShaiJch of Bahrain, the s 8.100 Shaikh who ratified the Treaty of Protection, and instituted his son (the present Shaikh) in his place. In this way, the Resident managed seize the rej^ns of real authority which is exercised by him up to this day. Kuwait came under British protection in 1913, when consequent to a family trouble its Biair Shaikh Mubarak-as- Sabah (grandfather of the present Bmir) resorted to asking assistance of the British Government. The Turks were then threatening. A British warship was at once sent to the waters of Kuwait. After the Great War a British Agency was also located at Kuwait.

Colonel Did^son - Who is he? It has coine to our knov;ledge that the British Government liave decided to pension off Colonel Dickson, their Political .agent at Kuwait from the corps of the Political Agents (in the Persian Gulf). He will be relieved by the British Consul at Muscat. Ve also understand that His Highness the Smir of Kuwait has appointed the said Colonel as his representative to the Company which he has granted an oil concession for Kuwait j and that the representsti^e*s permanent residence will be in London. do not, however, know whether this appointment has anything to dov/ith the difference arising between King Ibn Laud and the Company that difference which we referred to in a previous number. Colonel Dickson is very well known to the people of this country, for he was one of tbe Political Ofi icers during the British occupation: He became famous particularly famous in the Muntafik Aiwa, on account of his falling in with Arab customs in the matter of entertaining guests. There he had a guest-house in which coffee used to be poundec all day and rice cooked with mutton was continuously pro vided. His house was furnished in the bedouin fashion, with carpets and mgs laid on the ground. In it Dickson spent much of his time; there you could see him seated on the ground conversing with his guests, and taking part in the relation of bedouin stories and tales. Colonel Dickson’s policy in this country, however He sup -orted cir Nilson. But the was unsuccessful. British/Xv X i } .s' Britltsh aovemaent, having decided to change their policy in this country, terminated his services in Iraq, and appointed him as a Political ^gent at Bahrain. For reasons not as yet known to us he was again discharged frcm the political service, and for about one year he remained without political work. In 19&lt;31 a difference which had arisen between Bis Majesty King I bn Baud and Major Daly, the British Political x^gent at Bahrain, gave him a chance to resume his political career. The cause of the aboveinentioned difference was as follows: According to the provisions of the treaty between him and the British Government, Kir^ Ibn Baud, then Bultan of Nejd, was bound to send through the Political ^gent at Bahrain all his communications with the British Government. He observed then that Daly opposed him. Be, therefore, protest ed and asked that the mediator should be a person other than Daly. The British Government, famous as they are, to seize opportunities for turning anything into benefit, instructed their High Commissioner for Iraq, then Oir Percy Oox, to open negotiations with Ibn Baud in regard to the difierence arising between him and Major Ay. air Percy, it is understood liked i-ick;son and watched an opportunity to get him an appoint ment. lie, therefore, proposed him as a British Political at Ibn Sand's Court with headquarters at Qatif. By this proposal Sir Percy wanted to hit two birds with one stone. But Ibn Saud refused this proposal on the plea that the fanatic i/i in no case agree to the appointment ol people of Neja would in no east.

Thereafter Dicfcson iin the rank of I4ajor) was transferred to Hyderabad (India) to serve in the British Garrison at the Raja of Hyderabad’s capital. But in 1950 he was reappointed to the corps of Political Agents in the Persi an Gulf. This is the Colonel Hickson who has now been appointed by the limir of Kuwait as his representative to the Company that has obtained an Oil concession in his R&amp;irate. However, wq do not know whether or not the mir’s represent ative will succeed in the settlement of the difference arising between King Ibn oaud and the Oil Company.

It is understood that the Oaudi Government entirely decline to recognize the Kuwait frontiers, which were ratified by the Treaty of 1921, on the ground that when His Majesty King Ibn Baud signed the treaty, relating to these frontiers his concurrence was only temporary — Xt was merely to please his fx lend oil Percy Cox (that he did so), whose mission to Uqair was the last important matter that he had to put through in the East therefore His Majesty did not like that he should leave the East unsatisfied. jfurther, the King's representative at the above- ,.»tU,n.d Conf oranco ados «i«« *«•» U-e “d ^ ■“f ” 4 tt * „ld » daolarod op.nl, «•* 40444 “* b ‘ &gt; °“ 1 by it. „n example of how the British representative, who signed the Nejd-Kuwait frontier treaty at Cqair, was then aware of Ibn Baud's reservations, was the provision in that agreement of a clause to the effect that a particular area , • - ljKld W as to be declared a neutral zone, and was claimed by N@jd, was „ llw This neutral zone is bounded on the not settled finally, ^his ne * f tnlai'ah on the ^outh (north?) at East at the port of Juxai an, , „ n t h a ie st by tiie-unction of the Iraq-Kuwait Subaihiyah, ana on the &gt;es fr ai tier.

THE BSWlLDmSD KUWAIT COMPLAINS. miL IHKiHS BE MY OHS TO HSAB. We have had several talks with a multitude of our honourable Kuwaiti brethren who frequently come to this country to attend to their business concerns, and in the course of these talks we perceived deeply rooted in their hearts the bitterness of despair and hope* It is, therefore, with great disappointment that we find ourselves compelled to unveil many things, the Incidence of which could have been prevented by the wise policy of the ChiaTs and those who filled the highest positions in that isolated land, which is populated by a nation who conform to the Muslim religion and have pure Arab sympathies flowing in their veins, seeing that silence aver such conditions in a land whose welfare concerns us not a little is a destestable shortcoming towards those brethren with *om we are connected by ties of neighbourhood, blood and relationship. It the people of Kuwait had in a bygone epoch submitted to this Kindfautocracy, it was because that the extinct headships and chieftaincy that had then existed among them were of foresight and discretion enough to protect their rights, fulfil the oblivions due to them, ^ far more too* part with them in their effusive Arab empathies, however difficult the circumstances ana varied Is it not strange, therefore, tha the impressives were* P , « in her grievous inflictions, ^ -hoinved Palestine is in her while the belovea ^ -i +- v creeps tato the hearts of individuals and while magnanimity o y . fill par t s of the Arabian -World, urging and multitudes in all i .. p r0 thren the distressed people of *ales them to help their bretnre*- a - 'L t i : Palestine, Kuwait, the Muslim tom of Arabia, is hindered from performing her humane noble task when she moves to form committees and raise donations as her Arab sisters have don^ The troubfe in Kuwait lies with a batch of false retinue, and the people of Kuwait are, indeed, afflicted wit3 a company of dispersed fugitives. No nation has ever bean overwhelmed by the influence of such a retinue of irresolute prof it-seekers, but had lost her ascendancy and declined to a state of confusion and embarrassment. Yesterday arrived in Kuwait certain Zionist agents ji showingly to discuss with its G-overnment the export of fish from Kuwait to Palestine, at a time when this had been denied them by other Arab countries. Having realized that they were in a Muslim country, the spirit of whose popuiatia abounded with religious zeal and aroused Arab sympathies, 1 these agents preferred to work in darkness in order to succeed in their suspicious project. They, therefore, made their relations firm with that youth who has been cas&amp; out by his own country and has come to Kuwait in order to class himself among the retinue of profit-seekers. This ignorant youth almost drove the Government of Kuwait into an infamous problem, for absolution from wbieb all Muslims had resorted to Got# Having taken notice of these evil plots the people , -r.aA’Hytid that there lay hidden behind the of Kuwait at once realised wu, rvf* fish a terrible scheme of weapon misleading export of ^.isn -4 ^ erf events to their accomplices at smuggling by these Zionist agents to TW. *!«»««••' r °“ r.fu.lK «»* !•«« B '° U S “‘ 01 “““ &lt; * ri that they should bury the incident in town, and decided that tnej At this point 'the Smir perceived its craddle at any cost.

To the Luv*ait brethren who possessed this high spirit of Arab magnanimity, I said: 'W a s it not right that you should have brought to the notice of the authorities among you the plots of t&amp;ose who attached themselves to them and adhered to them for nothing but the achievement of their own desires and illicit material gain, seeking it wherever and however it is to be found, and then they care for nothing but to despise you and those presiding over you** 'You are right*, they replied, *But nothing could avail in the case of these strangers* If we had any say in our country’s affairs, none of these cast out strangers could have passed to the rank of retinue and favourites to observe and design* But we leave our word to C you, eager writers, to take up this serious question although by the way of advice and kind exhortation 1 * Truly, it is a venerable service which it is our duty, we Arab writers and journalists, to take up* if the Government of Kuwait is so liberal and generous as to allow a stranger, whose real object is unknown to them to creep into their retinue, and in the shortest time achieve the position of the loyal adviser, then this is an affliction which is the worst tat has ever befallen Kuwait. If the doubts and conjectures reported to us about the man's relations with foreigners in Kuwait turn to be true, do rulers feel assured about the results of these &lt;„=+ which we pray to God to protect them, relations, against wmcn v The complaints imparted by our Kuwaiti brethren there would be no space to explain them.

H is fortunately to perceive in the hearts with of those /whom we came in contact, the sincere love and loyalty they feel towards their Arab Emir, the descendant of the bright warriors. But they seem unsatisfied with such a nature as is controlled by the retinue and prof it-seekers who spoil the relations between the ruler and his subjects and turn the white black and the blackwhite. We who are interested in this Arab Emirate to go on strong and well established.! are not but to render our sincere advice to its administrators and at their head His Highness the Emir to reform the situation by good treatment to the people and the selection of persons of discretion and influence and consulting them in matters of puolic welfare, and also by keeping away that number of mean flatterers who separate betreen the ruler and his subjects. Thereby the subjects Hill open their hearts to him and averse persons will be regained# We are not far off many incidents and significant lessons all along the Gulf Coast, and especially at Bahrain Those heedless, therefore, should he cautious not to fall. . ill I j J !

According to the Arab Staff of this Agency the Announcer spoke on the following lines:- * The tension between the Kuwaitis and their 'Stair has lately increased as a result of the 'non-recognition by the Stair of the 'Constitution, submitted to him by the 'Council recently, because it contained 'something against the interests of the ''Colonizers'. « fhe Stair has formed a new Constitution 'for his country, which he is going to 'submit to the British Representative for 'approval, who lately returned from Amman. « The Kuwaiti youths cry for help from all'all the independent Arab States, and especially from Iraq to which they want 'Kuwait to be annexed.

The colonization Is taking a new syeteme of polotics in Arab!a.They flowing the foreigner* to come and setae in all parts of Arabia as they ave already done in Palestine.giving way to the Zayoniste to live &amp; vie he inhabitants, The same programs is followed with the Arab's Principa- ities oi the Gull .whose Amirs are very week end easily misguided, lany Dreigners were brought and pushed in &amp; were given the best posts in the ovt^ serviee^ They were used for special purposes .ie. to create any sort f trouble in the country. Consequently the A&amp;abs are becoming as forei- ers in their own country &amp; are eying the situation with anxiety.They ould make out the dangerous situatian of their countries. They knew,the ime will come when the foreigners will enslave them in their home. The Arabs, considering the matter .requested their Amirs to protect heir rights .but no one seemed to hear their cry. Therefore,they could ot tolerate it any mo re, and they declared that they ane unwilling to be Dverned by such cruel rsilers. Being this,the Amirs asked the foreigners 3 help them against any trouble and thps they opened the door for the )lonists who are watching eagerly these states and expecting a chance ) voluteer their help. Fe»months back,a new government was established in Kuwait and the 3g«slative assembly there,took in their hands all the government, ffairs in and out* They immediately begun clearing their country with is foreigners and put their influances to an end* The new Govt, set free the real inhabitants and gave them the chanc&lt; &gt; live in their own mother land and enjoy their liberty. But we are very sorry to say that this government did not last long, ■ter few months the foreigners revolted &amp; worked hard to i egai.- thePage, 2* ; , 4 9 Id authority,as they could not bear the light of the truth. Gradually he trouble was going from bad to worst and at last the foreigners asked he colonists to back them and regain their power and influence, As result f this,the Leg, Assembly failed and the foreigners were brought back to leir pests. The election was ordered and a new Mejlis was established and sue- jeded the first dismissed Mejlis, Only the true loyal Arabs were reeled- &gt;d and the nation trusted them. The new Majlis asked the Amir to grant lem constitutional Gcrtt^ which he promised to do,but nothing is seen up 5 now and the members are waiting patiently for the result of their iruggle , On the lid:, days, the foreigners hold a so it of manifistation in iwait which was going to cause a great trouble between them and the real .tizens of that country. Such nonesense demonstrations were carried on in • sa,vage manner and the Amir seemed to be quite willing &amp; happy,too. w, low it is the time for the Arabs to prove the real power of Union. &lt; hey must not bear such mokery and chasing any more which is done by the jreigners through the Amir. They must work hard to gain their freedom 7 any means « ( Son of the Gulf.) AThe Legeslative Assembly of Kuwait being Dismissed. fe came to understand tha,t H.H* Sheik jfchmad el Jabir tiad forwarded the Constitutional Law to the British Resident to examine it , jt was returned to the Amir after being studied,with some alterations and corrections. The Sheik had decided to dismiss the present Mejlie and order red a new election to take place. The Kuwaities are asked to elect six members only and the Amir will appoint the other six.Thus there will be two MejUses in Kuwait,being both under direct control of the Amir. Three prominent persons are to be deprived of their right of being elected,and these are the real Arabs who consider their responsibility towards their country. In this case, the two Mejlises ?/ill have no powex to do any thing independently,but they will have to follow the Amirs orders or suggestions. Thus they are of no benefit to the country.

On the 21st, the Announcer, after giving internal news spoke about Kuwait and its affairs, and the maltreatment which the liberals and the Youth receive from Shaikh Ali al Khalifah, the merciless, who punishes them with a bitumen-beaded club, like the persecution in the Middle Ages. Note: - (The bitumen-headed stick, or JiAqaak, is an Iraqi weapon, not carried by NraJl &gt;/.

Ifiy dear Sir Trenchard, His Highness inforaed us on the 24th that the *Qasr aa Zihour*** 'broadcast held again broadcasted about Kuwait on the same lines but addin* that Kuwait must be taken by Iraq, if not peacefully then by the Army, by force. 2 I understand from another source that a disgruntled Kuwaiti, Abdulla Sagar, a member of the Oouncil, who owns estates in Iraq has been promised by the Iraq Government officials the Mutassarrafate of Kuwait, or the future Kuwait seat in the Iraqi Parliament, after its capture by Iraq* In consequence he has gone to Baghdad and is helping to direct propa ganda against Kuwait* His main motive is, I think, to save his estates in Iraq, as last year he explained to me how frightened he was of having khe&amp;i extrac ued from him, and that he had been given hints that they would be, if he did not take the line expected of him by the Iraqis* There is also a certain amount Oi. ^face’* to be saved by him, as he talked ^yqtj Dig f in Iraq last year, when the Kuwait Council had more power than now 3./1%$ 3. Trade with Saudi AraMa is at a staad-still as you toow, and as I pointed out some time ago some Kuwaitis think that they would iim it more convenient economically to have closer connections with Iraq.. They must trade somewhere. 4. latest arrivals from Iraq, report that the large post put up hy the Kuwait Government some ten years ago on the frontier, which also serves as a Traffic indicator, has been removed, apparently on the night of the 23rd/24th.

The Shaikh of Kuwait became frightened from the attacks of the Arabic journals against his unwise policy and felt that it is not an easy matter not carry weight for the general opinion of the Arabs. He, therefore, called Shaikh Yusuf bin ’Isa and enquired from him about the reasons for these severe attacks ,whereas he was considering the submission of the Constitution. Shaikh Yusuf told him that the procrastination on His Highness’ that part put the Kuwaitis in despair,and/ in the circumstances, there was no alternative but to grant the requests of the people. He (the Shailch) promised that he would submit the Constitution as soon as he receives it from the British Political Agent. No doubt, the causes of this unbalanced condition are the foreingers in accordance with whose wishes the to go contrary to Shaikh acts,and the free-masons who advised His Highness to go contrary to the wishes of the people after that prevailing tranquility. long as such crows abide in Kuwait, there will be no peace. The Shaikh must ,therefore drive away this class of persons whose aim is to obtain a livelihood and whose sole object is to serve the prevailing tranquility. as long as such Kuwait, there will be no peace. The Shall drive away this class of persons whose ai, a livelihood and whose sole object is to Colonizers.

By our correspondence* Vhen Kasr az-Zehoor Station started broadcasting the news about Kuwait,people begun gathering and crowding at the coffee shops to hear the news from the radio, ihe crowd started shouting for the beloved king of Iraq and the Iraq Govt.,too* The Kuwait Govt forced the free Arabs to stop shouting,but in vain. The young men were tormented by tfe f?overnment,because they applaud for Iraq. The situation in Kuwait is very dangerous and unbearable. The poor free Arabs can tolerate it no more, rhey became like foreigners in their own country,and more than that,they are treated maanly^while the* foreigners are encouraged against uhem.

The Iranian School in Kuweit was opened and the opening cermony was performed by the Representative of the Amir. The Amir gave a denotion of two thousand Rupees for the school fund.

Before establishing the hew system of Government, Kuwait was in the dark governed by a dozen of rulers who used to carry on their pover according to their own wish and conscience p ying no heed to the Justice. The education was disliked and the nationality was not appreciated by any one. Kuwait was ruled by some persons who were dsiposing the country’s income according to their own wishes. ?he old government allowed the foreigners to come and settle is in the country, but forbidden the young Arabs to enter that country. They (Hulers) tried to bid the Sun light with their palms and stop the new revolution by means of whips. They reserved the Custom income and built dozens of shops and cafes and troubled the poor labourers for bribes offered to them by the Oil Company. Why should we pay custom duty on &gt;.uran (Muslim Bible), while Hew Testment is free of duty. Is this Vatican State pr a Muhammadan country They (the rulers) celebrate officially the birthday of Xing of England and in the same they forced their subjects to celebrate the said day, but if any ne would say something about celebrating the birthday of the Arab Prophet, they ould become angry. They (the rulers) do not like to hear anything about Palestine or to help the afflicted by the way of donation. I would have never believed that such things might have happned in Kuwait, but I have seen everything myself. If one of the attendatns of the Amir or even one of the servants be agasist you, be sure of paying heavy penalty,if it is not flogging, it must be pleading tome one to help you for pardoning. Bo one was allowed to use radio in any public place,while radio is of great benefit to the public.JLIS IH AUTHORITY ^ This was the general situation of the country, when a few youn^en were holding their meeting in some unknown places,planning,discussing and studying the situation. They decided tn J aecxaea t0 act openly. Most of them were from prominent Arab families of Kuwait who also belong to the Amir’s family, but the latter followed the British advice and asked the foreigners to help him. TJnder such circumstances the said young men declared their purpose to the Amir and asked him to agree to their request and allow the country to have a legislative Assembly in the charge t&gt;£ Government 1 affairs and to be responsible to the welfare of the people of Kuwait. The Amir was astounded, but could do nothing. He started thinking and | Imaging about the situation , but without purpose. At last he agreed md the State had their ; ajlis. ^ hat did the Majlis do during the period of the seven months? Everything became free. He announced that the people are the source of ill powers, that eans freedom and personal liberty. The Majlis cleared ;he foreigners from the Government offices. Then they went direct to ;he source of all troubles, '’Mulla Saleh*. That Mulla Saleh was sent exile. Most of them used to consider Mulla as a man of danger. Most &gt;f them believed his to be a 'Rasbooteen* of Russia, that is why his oclie was thought to be beyond the power of human being. They(: ajlis) organised the police, night guards, inside the country and at the shore 'hey (Majlis) decided to bring from Ira officers to organise the irmy and police. Then the Majlis passed the Bill of H Free Tariff* for ‘ruits and vegetables, stopped any sort of monopoly and allowed the sub lie places and ©toffee houses to use the radios publically * Thus uwait became a very different country within a short period - Contd-3 i(Ill) THE FOLLO IHG BILL3 VERE IHTRODUCED TO BE PASSED - '.laBgtng of Gustoo! duty according to the Custom of Iraq.considerir, situation of the country* 2.

Having seen this Shaikh and his followers with the British Government got frightned because no boubt the result will be against their policy. So they held si meeting and the Amir ordered the Majlis to be dismissed and new election took place. That being done so, the former members were re sleeted and started the managing of the Constitutional Law. -hen they affered it to the Amir to sign, he kept silent and the country is again being ruled by means of whips, and the foreigners are shouting that they are against the Arabs. ’*Tarik H The Above is Translation of an Arabic article published in the daily paper ’’An-Sas* of 17th Friday 1939, February, at Basrah*Kuwait is t fart of Iraq, Kuwait is a part of Iraq and shaifcl not be seperated from it and tide was Kuwait’s desire from the old time and still it is* When the Amir of Kuwgit and the British Consul agreed to have a eg.

But when the Mejlis declared that uwa.it wants iraq f both the Amir and the B .Consul failed .Thus Kuwait hich wan a part of Iraq,when the Turks were occupying Iraq,remained aithful to Iraq.

They know nothing of the modem civilization. Kuwaties mid tolerate no more such a systeme of government,and be treated like Laves in this twentieth century.

But this gentle crjf of the faithful Kuwaities was et with flagging,and the result was the revolution, and the establish- ®nt of a new government,which we objected its establishment in time, eing sure of the Amir's purpose.

Nobody could imagine that ^ie Amir would help the Iranians and encourage them against his subjects, aside that, the foreigners started emulating the Arabs and forcing them &gt; quit their mother land for the foreigners. We see the Amir keeping [lent and paying no heed to this sort of persecution. His followers ild him that this was the best way to punish the liberals, fe could not imagine that the Amir would run such a risk and be painst his faithful subjects^befrlending the foreigners whose sole itention is to put the Arab's power to an end. In this manner the foreign irs gpt their object and they easily misguided the Amir who is follwing ieir false advice# fhis forced the Arabs of Kuwait to ask io be annexed Iraq,in order to save their country from the foreigners.

The above article is the translation of the Arabic article published in the daily Arabic Paper, * An-Nas ' which is published in Basrah on ’Wednesday, 15th February, 1939.Kuwaife* 6 Problem bhould be Solved and those who are trying to exterminate the Arab Nationality should be put to death without mercy, Peple of Kuwait are the source of power and they have the full right M self -determination. W© did not think ths.t ths situ&amp;tion in Kuwo-it will b© ch&amp;ngsd quickly in this manner. The Amir of Kuwait diesmiseed the Leg. !&gt; sembly for the next time,paying no heed to the Constitution. He started .

He also tried to help the said foreigners to get eir object,preferring their benefits to the Arabs interests Then the Amir gun befriending the foreigners darelessly in such a way,that the country hiP ich is a pure Arab country,is going to be a non-Arab country. Everyone knows that Kuwait is a part of the heart of Iraq,and thus is Iraq*s duty to hurry and invade Kuwait and annex it to Iraq,even force,if necessary,as the G-ermans annexed Sudeit to Reich, le must also nsider that Kuwait is not like Sudeit to G-enriany,but it is rather like ein to Germany. On July,last,The Leg. Assembly of Kuwait was granted a constitution the Amir,in which he,the Amir,declared that the people of Kuwait are ie source of all powers.

Kuwait is a Part of Iraq.. Kuwait, in past and present, wants to join Iraq_ as it is an unsepara'ble part of it (Iran). We were the first to feel suspicion over the acceptance of the Amir and the British Political Agent to the formation of a Council of Administration in Kuwait. We then said that this must have Been done in order to prevent the Kuwaitis from asking for the annexation of Kuwait to Iraq. Both the 'hair and the British were disappointed when this Council, as we heard, wanted Iraq. The true fact, however, remained as it is in this small country which, in the time of the Ottomans, was a part of Iraq. Although, at last, the colonization policy separated this small part, yet the feelings remained in the souls and the Kuwaitis continued to say that they wanted Iraq, in spite of the cruelty and illtre&gt;tment to which the liberals were subjected there. The civilization whiefe which swept the whole world and changed the forms of rule, has not yet reached the Gulf Emirates, which continue to be ruled by”sticks' and administered by personal inclinations. The Kuwaitis, who are in touch with Iraq ^isagreed with this sort of thing, and refused to be treated as slaves in the 20th century. They started claiming their rights, demanding lange 0 f the styles of the early centuries, and made the mikhs understand that their ways would do nothing but icrease the influence of the colonizers. The response , this s weet and fine call was the beating with sticks lich led to the recent coup d'e'tat, which was not ivoured by us, as we were certain that it was detuned 3 gwerve our brethern from their esteemed desire,i.e, ^ +hp email part to its sympathetic mother mexation of the small p to accept it. God Aid not -r-r*4 4' l-N 4'u.eoi_- ^hoiud 'be fulfilled. How can it 'be fulfilled qnd there we in Kuwait national and glory-loving youth such as 11 Saauiyl A1 Thunayyan, A1 Khalid, A1 Barrak, A1 (5-hariim and other Arab families who always recite verses of gloiy and chant the Aral anthem. It was natural that this movement will have a reaction, hut it was not thought possible that the Amir turns to the side of Non-Arabs and helps the foreign elements against his Arab countrymen, in addition to his approach to the British. Yes, they supported the foreign elements in such a way that they tried to struggle with the Arabs and turn them out of the homes of their fathers and grandfathers. The Amir is not paying attention to this matter. His ill-natured suite advised him that this is &amp;he best remedy for fighting out the movement of dissatisfaction which aims to give Kuwait a life of prosperity. ¥e did not think that the Arab Amir becomes an enemy of his countrymen and gets into friendly terms with the foreigners whose idea is to overthrow the Arab Buie in that country. They are now sowing the seeds of these principles, and have now made the Amir under their orders As the position became dangerous, the Kuwaitis were constrained to declare their clear attitude towards the \rnir, the British and the foreigners. They said, 'We want Iraq'. They want Iraq hut are they far from Iraq? h of them have the same feeling, the same language, od, and relationship. Does Iraq* not want them and y are qts brothers, kinsmen and the sons of its ected port, who was sharing with him the pains of Potism and hardships. It was not hoped that Iraq omes independent, bids farewell to the re'gime of ression and hardships and its small part remains fering at the rejoice of the foreigners and from the potism of the uneducated and mean people. I '-3- 0* Ira iis l Kuwait is in danger. That a danger.’ The supported foreign elements will overcome and Kuwait wi 1 !j one day, turn into a foreign country, and its people will become minority if the present state of affairs continup to remain as they are now. If we will no more hear that cry, 'Te want Iraq.”, Kuwait, which is r natura l part and the only port of Irap , will die and the foreign elements will overcome. We do not know what will be the end. Kuwait now faces two contradicting movements; ie., a movement for separation from the Arabian Group and a movement for its annexation to it. Whichever movement overweights, will be successful. In this connection, it is the duty of Iraq., and more particularly, the duty of the Arabian nation to protect this fine country and return it to its sympathetic mother, as both are anxious to join one another, 1 -^ is necessary to take immediaoe steps against the danger before the object of the foreigner in this country is fulfilled.

I said that it was evident that reports pub lished in press emanated from completely unreliable sources and it was indiscreditable to Iraqi press that such rubbish alleging oppression and tyranny should be published by them. Demands made in some papers foir annexation of Kuwait by Iraq could only lead to embarrassment for Iraq in her relations with His Majesty’s Government and her nei^ihours. HAJI SHAUKAT said that he would take what steps he could to damp down press campaign, excesses of which he regretted but which were only typical of lack of restraint commonly shown by press of all countries when following up a 'stunt' agitation. At tlB same time he assured me that in many quarters in Iraq people felt keenly that it was deplorable that the Ruler of Kuwait should deny his people any effective shere in the Government of the principality and that he should spend nothing from his considerable public revenues on education. * alth or public services a* any kind. He was, he said, glad to teve mi s opportunity to tell +h1 „ point had latterly become so strong me that feeling on this poi that/the G ° Ve “ telegraphed to NHRI SAID in London asking him to SIB ak privately to Hi a Majesty’s Government and to ask that British influence in Kuwait should be used to persuade the Shaikh to develop a more enlightened Government and administration for his country. I said that it seaned that people in Iraq had wrong ideas about Kuwait. I had not been there myself but many people who had had spoken with enthusiasm of the general happiness of the people. There might not be any modern schools, but there were good religious schools, the mosques were well attended and public morality stood high. His Sxcellency rejoined that it was distressing to think that there were people so ignorant and backward that they could be satisfied with a merely religious education and he hoped that I would support the re presents ti on s which Nuri Said had been asked to make to His Majesty’s Government. I said I should certainly report what he had said to me.

'^asr az-Ziiiioor Wireless Bej.ore 'broadcasting the wordly news,the Announcer said as follows: - (In brief as far as I could write/down). 'On the night of 4th March the London B.B.C. Station 'broadcasted news stated to have been received by them from the Persian Gulf indicating that one of the countries neighbouring Kuwait had launched attacks against Kuwait through its Tireless Station, which had a bad effect amongst the Arabs of the other countries”. 'As this statement is untrue and throws no light on the real situation, we are now rebutting it. We say, 'It is the people of Kuwait who desire to join Traq_. 15 members of their Council, against 4, decided to join Iraq. Had they not wanted Iraq they would not have sent a deputation on their behalf to make Iraq hear their voice and coke to &lt; their rescue, since it is the custom of the J&amp;rabs to help those who take refuge with them. Education in Kuwait is in backwardness and the general opinion of the Kuwaitis 2 g not cared for there.

POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT.V Translation of article published in 'AN HAS' Daily newspaper Qi Basrah, No ,551 da tied. 17th February 1939. THE COUBCII OF ADliTIKIBTMTIQN. Bich Work Within a Short Time. Before and After the Council. -Y- V V TrvtTV Before the formation of the Council of Administration, Kuwait was in complete darkness and full of selfishness; ruled by several rulers according to their own wishes and not according to justice. Education was considered to be an unlawful trade, nationalism, a meaning less word and service, progress and reform, vague words and untrue dreams. Absolute illiteracy dominates over the minds of the people who are fast asleep in extreme backward ness and degenration. A country ruled, directly and indirectly, by a party of different persons, who handle the resources of the country in the same manner as the owner deals with his own property • A party whose God is gold and whose capital is corruption - corruption ox characters by the encourage ox acts ox treachei^ and bribery. A party who are not interested in anything except in dashing at the tables of food as the crow pounces upon a corpse. One of the important defects of the past rule was the free admission into the country of all types of foreigners and the strict measures taken in admitting the Arabs especially the modern youths. They try to cdsver the sunlight with hand paims and stop the current by the use of whips. They sharec the great and trifling income of the country and monoplised the shops and coffee-shops. The authorities, who collect taxes and rents, monopolised all the resources and made away with the rights of the Kuwaiti labourer by accepting a small bribe from the Oil Company. They/- il• 2 - They.'became amasingly silly and rash. *or example, Quran is liable to duty but the Bible is exempt from duty as if this countiy belongs to Vatican and is not the home of liuhamedan youths and. believers in Quran, They officially celebrate the Birthday of the King of the British and force the people to participate witii them, but get angry at anyone who calls to celebrating tiie birthday of the Arab Prophet and become extremely annoyed with anyone who urges the people to afford financial help to the victims in Palestine. These facts are almost incredible, and had I not noticed them myself, I would not have believed them. In this way the silly people submit to the British authorities who, on several occasions, pointed out that such extreme submission is quite contradictory to the desires of the British Government who fear the loss of good faith between the Ruler, on whom they rely, and the people, whom they are cheating. There is also the question of personal respect. Should any imprudent servant or retinue (of the Shaikh) becomes on bad terms with you, you will have to suffer its consequences either by receiving lashes from whips or by imploring this and that to intercede and apologize for you. Further, they forbade the use of radio, which is a means for culture and a product oj. civixi^atiOii, in the public places, etc. after the COUNCIL. In the midst of this continuous degeneration, there was a party of free-born Kuwaiti youths who were thinking very seriously of the effective remedy for lifting this Arab country from the ditch in which it was about to fall. After taking preliminary steps and holding secret meetings, they made out a splendid pW and came out to/-•3- to the field of action with an unresistihle spirit. They are c °asii9re4 to he of the noblest, strongest ana- most prominent -irah families. They served as a warning of the revolution of the spirit of Arabs, who are known as defenders of honour, justice and glory, with whom the Ruling Family of Kuwait is connected 'by ties of descent and relationship. The history of these .Aral families of Kuwait is full of struggle, side hy side, with the As Sabah Amirs for the defence of this small Emirate. But recently the Ruling Family submitted very humbly to the British authorities and enlisted the help of foreign elements for fear of being overcome and for their desire to isolate from the Arab Unity, as they imagined that such Unity comes into existence by the abolition of separate rules. The .Arab Party who represent the clear rights of Kuwait submitted, all of a sudden, their demands to the Amir of Kuwait, asking for his permission to form a Council of Administration in order to lift the country up and lead it to the path of eternal life, in conformity with the present time and the civilization of the world. The Amir started deeply reviewing in his mind the history of these families, who did very well In defending Ao Sabah Family. We learnt this at the moment when he Kepu silent for a while before saying anything. After violent negotiations, he agreed to the formation of the Council, -mat did the Council do during the 7 months? It declared at once the principle of equality, “It is the nation who should exercise power'. This is the result of every irregular situation and improper rule. It is the nation who should exercise poser. • people.* The rights of individuals are their personal freedom/-M ~4- fP08d.OHl 3.S fgtP Q.S DUbli O 'i‘n+Qr'oc.+ • „ Olio interest is concerned, freedom Of commerce aod freedom of movement. The country is for ail. Let us tiien work for all. Tne first thing done hy the Council was the re-organization of the departments. As it was desired that reforms should he carried out auickly and without any waste of time, the first step taken as was the deportation of Mulla Salih, head of the chinos, to Iraq.. His deportation, was met with a great surprise hy the simple people who used to look upon him as a man of mysteries and wonders. Their belief in him was no less than the belief of the Russians in Raspotine. The deportation of Mulla Salih was the eighth wonder of the world and one of the miracles of the present time. The Council then started organizing a Police Porce. They made \ the policemen wear one sort of uniform and introduced order and disciplin. Might watchmen, coastal and desert guards were appointed. The Council had an intention of bringing an officer from Iraq, to organize the force properly. Taxes on fruit and vegetables were waived. Professionals and traders were allowed to enjoy their previleges. Unrestricted monopolies were cancelled, and landlords were allowed, to make use of their properties. Radioes were permitted to be used in public places. All these were done in one month’s time which made Kuweit a new country admiied hy its people. The other projects decided to he carried ouo wer€ the application of Iraq. Customs Regulations with modifications to suit the condition of the country. Construction of a hospital to fully satisfy the needs of the country and formation of a Sanitary Department. Education for Doth males and females.

Being desir*ous to carry out refoi-ms as quickly as possible, the Council at once callefl for a good architect from Iraq, direct, without obtaining the views of the British Consulate. This caused the Buling Family, the foreigners and the British authorities to be frightened. They held a meeting forthwith, and., without previous notice, gathered their forces in order to avoid any resistance. Then the Shaikh passed his orders for the dissolution of the Council depending on the support of foreigners, and announced his desire to hold a new election. The Council was thus dissolved, a fresh election held and the same members succeeded. They worked out a Constitution which they passed for signature. He (Shaikh) is still putting off the matter and the country is now 'being ruled despoticly and 'by the use of whips. The foreigners are demonstrating against the nolle Arabs; ( T A R I Q)CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir p •itn reference to your letter of the 22nd February, No. E. 1355/66/91 enclosing a copy of telegrams from His Majesty's Minister at Jedda on the subject of recent Iraqi propaganda against Koweit and Bahrein, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a telegram from the Political Resident in the ' Persian Gulf reporting the nature of the attacks which are being made against Koweit and its Ruler in the-Iraqi press and wireless broadcasts and urging that early action may be taken with a viev/ to securing the suppression of the attacks and a relaxation of the tension which they are v causing in Koweit. A copy of a telegram from the^Government of India on the subject is also enclosed. Lord Zetland fully supports the Resident's suggestion that strong diploma tic representations should be made bo the Iraq Government with a view to the prompt suppression of the press and wireless attacks on Kowcit, cne toleration of which cannot fail to be regarded as an unfriendly act against a State and its Ruler under the protection of His Majesty s Government.

He suggests, and Lord Zetland agrees, that the representations GUci u it is suggested should be made to the Iraq Government should cover also the attacks on Bahrein. The Resident, with the support of the Government of T^dia, further suggests that an excellent effect in Iraq, and Koweit would result if His Majesty’s Government’s obligations for the protection of Koweit, as stated in the letter from the Political Resident to the Sheikh of 3rd November 1914, were reiterated publicly by means of an arranged question in Parliament and subsequent publicity in the Arabic world. Lord Zetland would also support this suggestion and if Lord Halifax agrees would propose that the terms of the question and answer might be concerted depart ment ally. r/ith reference to the recent telegrams from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda on this subject Lord Zetland assumes that Lord Halifax will agree that Ibn Sand should not be given any encouragement to intervene v.ith tne Iraq Government/3.

Nuri has sailed into this maelstrom, confident that he can survive; my Master Patrick in Baghdad is a little dubious, but we live in hopes The visit of H.R.H. the Crown Prince of ’Iran was a great success, although the ’Iraqis thought that they had been put to a great deal of unnecessary trouble and expense for what was not, in the strict sense of the word, an official visit. The young man is attractive, if a trifle arrogant, and apparently got on well with^ the King and off with the Amir Abdul Ilah. He was pleased with his reception, but occasioned some slight embarrassment at the Royal Bilat, where he and his entourage were accommodated in the guest- ffing, by demanding the provision of three powder-puffs. Why three? Your little Principality of Kuwait still continues to occupy the attention of our ’Iraqi journalists and associate pan- Arabist groups. I don’t know who is behind the Present movement but I suspect that Herr Grobba may be supporting it ^directly fo 'nuisance value'.

De ar Here is another little bunch of press extracts, including a poem which was also broadcast from the Qasr az Zihour station, which you may find of interest. Unfortunately we missed one or two of the recent Palace broadcasts, so the Ambassador was not armed with sufficient ammunition when he went and saw the King last week, and was unable adequately to twist the regal tail. Nuri is of an opinion that Ghazi, inspired by Farouk’s example and the recent visit of the Grown Price of ’Iran, is now anxious to pose as leader of the nation, and has chosen Kuwait as a pleasant imperialistic ’Iraqi gesture. Your own bad-hats have supplied plenty of material for the local press to work on, and there is the taint of Teutonic money in the air. The usual diplomatic representations have been made, and questions will probably be asked in the House at home. Nuri has also promised to apply sedative treatment, but wants to set his own disorderly house in order first. The recently discovered plot against the Royal House, and the numerous arrests which have ensued in the Capital, will probably deflect ’Iraqi intents into other channels for some time to come.

Assembly end himself was at its worst. The armed Iranians started strolling in greet numbers shouting and challenging the free Arabs of thet State. This sort of demonstration awakened the Arabs and caused their appeal to Irao to annex Kuwait. The Iranians in Kuwait form nearly one third of the total population i*e* 20 thousand out of 50 thousand which is the total strength of Kuwait population* The Amir depends on the 20 thousand and the h.Govt, to retain his power and influence as a ruler of the State. The former Mejlis,before being dismissed by the Amir had declared that the British interests will be safe guarded and protected. But the Amir changed the last phrase into w Kuwait is having its self govern ment under Brtish Protection. ” So the Amir had changed the old agree ment and put his State under direct protection! « Did the Britishers protect or defend Kuwait when Faisu acUDewish attacked Jahra Y It is worth to mention that the formen Meilis which consisted of 20 members, three of which belonged to the Amiris party,all as one body refused to accept the constitution which was offered by the Amir. Later on the. Amir dismissed the Mejlis» This action caused the question of annexing Kuwait to Iraq t©&gt; grow staedily^but strong.
