Political Kgent • Mr. Rj:. F.llison. Medical Officer. Captain A.G.T. Matthews. 2. iifcDICAL . (a) . Saiyid Tariq bin Taiaur, President of the Municipal Council has done a good deal to improve the standard of public hygiene, and there was a pronounced improvement over the last year. DJ).T• has been used to some extent in the Health Department’s anti-malaria scheme. (b) The Agency Hospital remained open throughout the year. There ms a great Increase in the work carried out by the Hospital owing to the absence of the staff from the American Mission Hospital at Muttra which was closed from September onwards. As the Assistant Agency Surgeon was withdrawn in Iky, 1948 all this extra work fell on the Shoulders of Dr. Matthews. Ififeje of attendances. mi. door. 30,302. 23,981.

Though loss in % 1948 the illness was severe and in many oases Cerebral symptoms supervened with fatfc.1 results. Anti—Malaria treatment was given with Quinine, He peering Arsenic. Paludrine mu given as a preventative for the first tin*, and where patients took their treatment seriously good results were attained. Anti-Malaria measures improved under the control of the Muscat Municipality and the inhabitants are yearly becoming more accustomed to preventative measures. Ulcers, boils, skin, eye and ear diseases and Tonailitis are at least as frequent as heretofore. The summer sets up s cycle of disease events. First prickly heat which often leads to Septic Prickly Heat and fimlly to boils and ulcers. Patients are treated with early oil lavage of the akin and later penicillin. Venereal diseases with Syphilis manifesting itself in divers nmnners • heavy toll of health and life. 80% of the poorer classes are Infected and treatment with Arsenic and Mercury are very unpopular whereas Penicillin supplies can never keep pace with the demand. / Bowel diseasesBowl diseases and dysentery are on the increase owing to the millions of flies that irm de Muscat during the date season. Half the population are said to have Tuberculosis but nothing can be done for this unless a T.B. centre is set up. There me a number of heat stroke and heat exhaustion oases due to the very hot ~ mmfmr this year and a campaign to encourage an Increase in salt intake had sooe success* The Hospital remained without wire gauze throughout the year* The suffering of the sick from flies was acute. Four fans were installed in four wards of the hospital and the dispensing floor was re-cemented. Supplies of drugs and dressings ftrora England through the Chief Medical Officer, Bahrain were satisfactory. (o). quarantine. The Quarantine Station at Hareml has had a complete overhaul. ▲ wall 6 feet high was built from the sea to the hill- behind completely shutting off the quarantine Station from the village. The building for housing contacts had a new roof put on, mils repainted and unnecessary annexes done away with. A platform was built on the sea side and the compound cleared of all ntoble. There was no asjor epidemic during the year. On dhow with a Small Pox case was isolated at Hare me 1 , the patient treated in the Quarantine Hospital building. ieaales, Mumps and Chicken Pox occurred during the year, but no serious outbreak. 2044 vaccinations were carried out and 1251 anti-Cholera Inoculations amongst passengers by ship and dhow. Vaccine lymph continues to come in sufficient quantities from Lahore. Other vaccines and Serums are received as required from the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, Bahrain. 3. POLITICAL SITUATIOM. (a). Tribal . tarly in the year Shaikh Suleiman bin Hamyar al Riami bought a oar from irnbai anti took it to Blxkat al Uoz. This ms the first motor —hide evar to reach ,.i&lt;zwa and Oman. The people 'ho delivered the oar to Shaikh Suleimn received pemdsaion to drive it through to Nona to show it to the Imam. There ms some anxiety as to the Imam's reactions, hut contrary to expectations he at first showed no interest) he did, however, express his disgust with the drivers and passengers, who apparently smoked openly and did not conform with his ideas of good behaviour. Later he guve the oar his official blessing and took a ride in it himself but subsequently he reverted to his attitude of disapproval and in the end Shaikh Suleiman had to dispose of the oar. I Shaikh KhalldShaikh Kh&amp;lld who succeeded as head of the Beni Bu All tribe, Ja'alan on the death of his father Shaikh All bln Abdullah al hamoodah al Alvl was not accepted by the tribesman as their chief; they appointed Instead Salim bln Abdullah, brother of the late Shaikh. The Imam's daughter who parried Shaikh Ahmad bln Hamid died early in the year. The Sultan dismissed the Balls of Shlnas, Sohar, Mussanna' and Khasab. Sultan bin Salim the deposed Shaikh of Ras al Khlisah took refuge In Muscat in August after he had attacked the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Residency Agent at Sharjah with a loaded reTolver. The Sultan afforded him the proverbial 'Arab Hospitality 4 , and off erred to mediate between the deposed Shaikh and Ris Majesty's Government. At the end of the year negotiations were still proceeding, with every prospect of success. The usual spasmodic raids on camel caravans and buses plying between Muscat and Dubai and Sharjah occurred throughout the year. The Sultan was able to do little or nothing for their safeguard. Early in the year Shaikh Mohammed bin Naslr al Ma'abi of the Abu Bagra arrived In Muscat to discuss the question of these raids with the Minister of the Interior but nothing came of these discussions and the raids continued. There has been throu^iout the year a general exodus of the Bedouin to the Oilfields of Bahrain, Qatar, Dhahran and Kuwait where they hope to obtain employment. (b). Local . Events In India and Pakistan were followed •with much Interest • The deaths of Mahatma Ghandl and Mohammed All Jinnah were deeply regretted, and marks of condolence were shown by all classes of the population. The Hyderabad 'incident 4 caused some feeling amongst both Indians and Pakistanis. On July IOth and Agreement was signed between His Highness and the Imperial Bank of Iran whereby a branch of the Imperial Bahk of Iran was permitted to be opened In Muscat. The Bahk started functioning on the 25th September and the flrit Manager was Mr. D. Scott. The merchants had for long been clamouring for a bank and business so far has been fairly brisk. The birth of a son to Their Royal Highnesses Princess Elisabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh was received with great rejoicing by all. The Consulate flagstaff was dressed and there was a round of parties where the healths of Their Royal Highnesses and the young Prince were freely drunk. His Highness' /congratulations were♦congratulations were sent to Their Majesties the King and Queen and to Their Royal Highnesses* In April the Sultan Issued an 'Alan 1 * prohibiting the sale and import of liquor in his territory* As soon as it was known that Muscat vies going 'dry* many ^of the local wine-bibbers began stocking their cellars with whatever they could lay their hands on at any price* His Highness unofficially permitted a reasonable quota to be Imported in the name of the Political Agent for the use of the Christian cotssdnlty* In November the Sultan stabilised the Baiza and fixed it at 100 balsas to the rupee* The baiza had been fluctuating rather alarmingly and had at one time reached the low level of 50 to the rupee* The minting of a large quantity of new balsas in various denominations was a blow to the merchants who had been hoarding the old ones* The stabilisation of the baiza had little effect on the cost of living* though the price of local foodstuffs* reckoned in rupees* fell slightly* On the 4 th October His Highness decided to appoint Col* B* Woods-Ballard* C•!*£•* M*B*£** as Minister for Foreign Affairs* This caused some dissatisfaction among certain State officials* who felt they would be deprived of much of their power* However* they had some respite for Col* Woods-B&amp;llard was in England up to the end of the year* A British subject* named Hayatoon* whA is said to have committed acme six or seven murders in^Gwadur and Mekr&amp;n was arrested at Gwadur and brought under escort to Muscat and is at present confined in Jalall prison* Difficulty has arisen over his trial for the Gwadur murders* partly on procedural grounds and partly because the witnesses from Gwadur are afraid to come and give evidence against him* It is hoped* however* to bring him to trial shortly* The following transfers among Kalis occurred during the years Hilal bin Saud, Hall of Khaaab appointed Wall of Gwadur* Hamood bin Ahmad was appointed Kali of Sohar in place of Saud bin Harlb but was later dismissed for embezzlement* Ibrahim bln Saud was appointed as Kali of Khasab* Saiyid Majid bin Taimur formerly Kali of Blrka was appointed as Kali of Musinah* (c). QU- Major RJR*R* Bird* formerly an I*P*S« officer but now working with Petroleum Concessions Limited as Liaison Officer* arrived in May with Shaikh bin Sultan bln Said to report to Bis Highness on his successful approach to the A1 Bu Shaads and the Bu Khuraiban (Na'im) tribes. Re had paid substantial sums of moneyof money to these two tribes for permission to explore parts of the interior for three years extendable for a further period of two years should the Company deem it necessary. The Sultan was much perturbed by the Company's direct negotiations and objected to the procedure partly fearing the loss of his prestige with the tribes, though this in fact is small,and partly less the tribes should be encouraged to open their mouths too wide. However, the Sultan and Bird finally reached an agreement satisfactory to both parties which should facilitate future exploration in the interior. In short the Woman and the Cat have come to an agreement; but the Man and the Dog have still to ratify it. It is reported that some of the Baraimi tribes have declared that they will not pay allegiance to the Sultan, as they feel that any agreement about oil In their territory should be with them and not with His Highness. Muscat is already being talked of as a 'boom town' should oil be discovered in commercial quantities and merchants have fantastic ideas of the fortunes they are likely to make. In early March Petroleum Concessions Limited sent a Geologist party to Dhofar but the survey proved that there was little prospect of oil being found there. The Sultan was much depressed by Petroleum Concessions Limited's report and has asked that if the Company do not intend operating at Dhofar they should give up their option there and allow some other firm to take over the Concession. 4. TRADE . (a) . Statistics of imports and exports for the last two years are given in the appendix. Total imports for the year show a decrease of Rs.38,80,500 when compared with 1946/47. There was a decrease in imports from India of about SOJL partly made up by the increased imports from the Persian Gulf, China, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America • Exports increased by Rs.I4,00,600. Most of this increase was due to the enhanced export trade to India. The chief imports during the period under review were, cereals, coffee, e ghee, sugar and textiles, while the main exports were, dates, limes and fish. (b) The exchange rate of the Maria Theresa dollar has remained fairly low. It opened at Rs.225/» to 100 M.T. dollars in January and closed at Rs.I85/~ to 100 M.T. dollars in December. The highest figure reached in the year was Re.230/- to 100 M.T. dollars. The annual rise during the date season was very slight this year.6 (c)« The import restrictions in India which were relaxed in 1947/48 did miah to improve Uuscat's date export business and the price of dates in general had substantially increased in 1948 as compared with 1947 when restrictions were in force in India. The export of dried fish as fish meal for manure to Ceylon and Holland showed a marked increase. 5. CUSTOMS . Mr. M.A. Rashid continued as Director General of Customs throughout the year. AIK . The airfields at Masirah and Salalah were in use throughout the year. The Sultan agreed to the use of Maslrah and Salalah airfields by French Military Aircraft for a period of three months 9 but insisted that there should be a formal agreement if they intended to continue using the airfields for a further period. Q&amp;ntas Airways had applied for a renewal of their authorisation to fly over Muscat territory and land there if nacer aary. Kls Highness is agreeable to its renewal subject to an authorization fee of L.5/- per aircraft per annua. 7. % The French Consulate remined closed throughout the year. Their building is now being occupied by the Imperial Bank of Iran. 8 . imimjxnHBU- The U.S.S.'Greenwich Bay* with Captain W.S. Butt in command galled at Muscat on the I9th July and left on the 23rd. Little or no enthusiasm wss shown locally and 'the State authorities showed great reluctance to entertain the men of the warship. His Highness had to be persuaded to receive a call by the American Captain. 9. JBBggLMK. The American Mission (Dutch Reformed Church) wae served by Rev. J.R. Kapenga and Dr. Hueainkvwld who replaced Rev. Dykestre and Dr. W. Thoms. The good work done by the Mission does not appear to be appreciated by the Government who dosed their school in 1947 and will not allow it to be reopened. Dr. and Mrs. Fuesinkveld, who had arrived from Kuwait with Muscat visas granted by the Politidwl Agent, Kuwait had some difficulty in landing and were very nearly sent back; but the Political Agent was able to smooth over the ai sunder standing. £ 10. Slavery.1 (•). 2 . 14 alavea applied far and received Manumission Certificates during the period under review. All the applicants had applied for nanumiasion on the grounds of ill treatment by their Banters. 11. figimnist Activities. There is practically nothing to report. A school teacher in Gwadur said to have Communist sympathies was dismissed. 12 . mm m - &lt;uscat experienced a severe gale on July 7th f which not only a great deal of damage to sailing craft, cargo and houses but was also the cause of loss of life. ^ he an :er oi I94&amp; will go down in the annuals as the worst for am many a year. The hottest month was May when the maximum temperature was III© on the 24th, the coldest month being January when the temperature dropped to 62°. Highest humidity ms 100 $ in the months of July and August, ftisoat had a little « over 5* of rain during the year. PiJff II i. mm fmx. j His Highness returned to Muscat from Dhoftur on March Sth and remained in the Capital for the rest of the year. While in Dhofar he discovered deposits of iron ore with a 94 % content of iron. He sent a sample of the ore for analysis to Sir Cyril Fox who stated that the ore me of very good quality but that there should be at least one / million tons of it before it oould be corrercially exploited. .the Sultan maintained good health throughout the year. His dealings vdtH the Political Agent have at all tinea been most cordial and friendly. ^ Unde 6 f His Highness. Visited Bonfcay in the second week of December and me still amy at the end of the year. His visit is believed to have been primarily to discuss State affaire with the ex-Sultan. frigid Taiiaiir bin The ex-Sultan remained in India throughout the year. Was to have visited Dhofhr but the visit did not mterialiee. ' He remained Minister of the Interior during' I94£. He left Muscat for Sohar early in June with the object of opening the Wadi Jiaai to motor transport. He returned to Muscat with great pomp and show, having* an escort of over 300 oamels. One result of his visit to Sohar ms the dlsndaa.1 at th. Well of Sohar for •Bb.szlasient •(•) flalyld Taria bin Talmur * Held the post of President of the Municipal Council throughout the year. He visited India in June and returned in the first week of August • He is very popular both with the Arabs and foreigners* (f). Saivid Fahr bln Tainrur. Brother of the Sultan. Is now completing a course at the Infantry School in Karachi after which he will be attached to an infantry unit in Pakistan. 2. m ass mjm mA Saiyid Tariq bin Tainrur , President of the Municipality did his utmost with what little resources were at his disposal to improving the cleanliness of the public thoroughfares. The Municipality carried out the following important work during the years 1. Enlargement of the road from Muscat 9 Agabh to Muttrah. 2. Removal of dung heaps. 3. Spraying of D.D.T. to exterminate flies and mosquitoes. 3. EDUCATION . Under the Headmaster, a Palestinian named Qhalib Naqshbandi and two new Palestinian teachers, Pais Shahbuddin and Akil Dujani, the standard of education has been raised considerably. The two young Palestinians have modern ideas and their attempts to study local conditions with a view to improving them has met with strong resistance • Dujani attempted to introduce Physiology into his classes but was told that the Sultan objected to it and he had to stop. It appears that the Sultan is som»\ 7 hat doubtful of the advantages of improved education at present, possibly from the fear of rousing religious prejudices. The Girls 1 school under the supervision of Mistress Munirah is rapidly improving. 4. GENERAL COM 1UNICATI0NS . During the year 1943 direct cable communication was maintained with Karachi and Aden, except for a temporary interruption to the Karachi cable due to storm dairage on June 7th. The system has been greatly strengthened by the renewal of Shore-ends for both the Karachi and Aden cables by C.S. 1 Retriever* early in October, replacing emergency Shore—ends laid in during the late war. During 1949 it is expected to mke the Aden/lfuscat/fc&amp;rachi chain fully automatic. Under the new system efficiency will be much improved, delays reduced still further and line errors reduced to a minimum. Communication with Bahrain and Kuwait is, at present, by cable to Aden and thence by wireless. It is hoped that the cable between Muscat and Bahrain will be repaired shortly and a new Shore-end laid in at Muscat.2 . App&amp;r&amp;tufl and stores for • new telephone system for Musoat and Mxttxwh have been arriving steadily and it is hoped to make a start cm the installation within the next six months. For the first tine Cable and tireless f Unseat have recruited two young Musoatie for training as operators • This appears to be a part of a new eoheme to handle traffic in i*rabic. The two boys were sent for training to Cable 6 tireless headquarters et Karachi. The Post Office which had formerly been under the Gowemaent cf Pakistan wee taken over on April 1st by the British Post Office under a British Postal Superintendent with his headquarters at Bahrain. 5 . mmm- 22 ships (mail) called et Musoat from India and 25 froa the. Gulf during the year. Besides the above 23 others both British and Foreign called here either on their way to or from the Gulf. POLICE .

Greenwood held the post of Commandant of the Muscat Levies throughout the year. Major Greenwood reports that with increased nsnhers and a higher standard of education among the M.C.OS the Muscat Levies could be comparable to any equivalent Indian Any Unit, as the men are of good material and stout heart. The establishment et present consists of 2 Pakistan Army Officers and 3 local Officers. The total strength of the force stands at 305 other ranks. 8. ROYAL NAVY .

The lowest price eas Rs.4/9/- per naund. The price of rice which is naiftly snuggled in flrora Pakistan mas sold at between He .100/- and Ra.170/- per bag. There is considerable snuggling of cotton plecegoods fron Gwadur to Pakistan where they fetch very good prloes. In February a clash between the Zlkrls and the Jluesulnans of Dori-rek over a question of sacrifice was narrowly avoided, by the intervention of the ball and tbe British Agent. There mere four oases of Snail Pox, two of which mere fatal. Dr. Hotala, the Assistant Agency Surgeon, mas sent to Gwadur to deal with the oaaea and to vaccinate the population. Pakistan currency mas in circulation in Gwadur for a while but the Sultan made the Indian rupee the only legal tender. #ith Gwadur and Pakistan so closely linked econoaioally It is difficult to see bow this arrangeasnt can work for very long. 4. to aw- The figures of imparts and exports are included in those for Muscat. Gwadur's export fish trade remained reasonably good. Large quantities 5. Attempts to find a doctor for Gwadur are still without success. Total prohibition was enforced in May.In Decrriber a Company calling it pelf 'The Hualia MarigBtion Caapany of Karachi' imvguratad a not or passenger and cargo service to Gaadur via P&amp;snl • The Introduction of this service has been sell received by the people of Geadur as it ^ is a ftst and frequent service and its rates are less than those of the B.I., whose slow nail service is not able to deal with all the passenger traffic to Karachi. 6 . tsm m, ?mmm- The Gwadur Post Office continued to function most inefficiently under the Pakistan administration.

AL KHALIFAH . (1) His Highness Shaikh sir SalmaB M^JjPgsa A1 f - ■ 7303 I WZ-'ATSjl I _ IS4^ J There is little reaaarkable to record about Shaikh Salman during the year* He maintained his attitude of being, on the whole, co-operative with His Majesty's Government and of being aggrieved about Zubara. He, perhaps, grows in pomposity and rigidity during the years* His health remained good* In June he suffered from a large and painful boil but refused to have it lanced* He turned down offers of trips to the United Kingdom sponsored by His Majesty's Government and to the United States of America, sponsored by 'his' oil company, on the grounds that American feeling was pro-Zionist and that therefore an Islamic ruler should not visit such a country* His real motives are more likely to have been his fears of embarrassment amongst strangers, of travel ling and of leaving the only limited world he actually knows* (ii) In August the Shaikhs Latifah bint Shaikh Ibrahim bin Khalid, wife of His Highness, left by steamer for Karachi en route to the Hijaz. She was accompanied by a large retinue who were enabled by the fact that their baggage was exempted from search, to smuggle a number of gold sovereigns into Karachi* The Shaikha returned to Bahrain in November* While on pilgrimage she was presented by King Ibn Saud with 2 Ford Mercury cars* (ill) His Highness* two uncles, Shaikhs Muhammad and Abdullah bin Isa, both travelled abroad during the year, Shaikh Muhammad spending parts of the year in Egypt and the Lebanon, end Shaikh Abdullah going in November to Kuwait for/hawking trip into the hinterland. (iv) In July, Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed al Khallfah, Superintendent of Police, Bahrain, and a cousin of His Highness, left for the United Kingdom at the in vitation of the British Council,* A very full programme was made for his visit and included visits to schools, colleges, docks, municipal councils, courts and various police institutions in both England and Scotland* He returned to Bahrain in September. (v) In December, His Highness received a round robin signed by a large number of the Al-Khalifah Shaikhs asking him for Increases in their allowances* He was at first incensed at this threat to his pocket but the Shaikhs pressed their demand with such obstinacy that he became alarmed and eventually yielded* He has now increased the allowances to the Al Khalifah family by Hs.2,80,000/- per annum, this amount to be paid from his own income* Suggestions are made from time to time that the people of Bahrain are about to turn upon and pull down the oligarchy of the Al Khalifa, many of whom are lazy. Ignorant and vicious and yet draw substantial allowances for doing nothing* There are no overt signs that such suggestions are true* 2. EDUCATION.2 2. The schools are still crowded and there is a long waiting list of boys for admission. There were a number of vacancies in the teaching staff at the begin ning of the year and attempts were made to obtain more trained teachers from Egypt, Syria, and the Lebanon. They were especially successful in Egypt, the Egyptian Ministry of Education agreeing to the secondment of 26 teachers to the Bahrain Government Education Department. This mission includes a number of senior and experienced teachers some of whom have received a teacher's train ing at British Universities. The Bahrain Government have also been recruiting more pupils for their teachers training class which was begun in 1947. Nine pupils were recruited during the year making a total of eighteen. During the year a drill display was held by the girls' schools, this being the first time that girls have drilled in public. No. of schools in existence on 1-1-1948 - 16 M H w opened during 1948. - 2 ' ' « closed * 1948. ' M students on 1- 1- 1948 - 3414 ' • ' ' 31-12- 1948 - 2727 3. MH igu y ssB* The prices of vegetables and lucerne, twe main fodder crop, were very high throughout the year. More land was put under cultivation at the Government experimental farm at Budeiya and the agriculturist in charge was sent to Iraq to buy seeds and fruit trees for the farm, Bock some of the Shaikhs, and other owners of gardens. The Government is also interested in develop ing some of the open land on the island and has asked the Bahrein Petroleum Company for an opinion of the possibility of supplying enough water to irrigate an area of 100 acres. The Company replied that there were many areas where new cultivation could be under taken without overtaxing the existing supplies of water provided it was done in accordance with a proper water conservation scheme. 4. WATER CQNSFBVAXIQIj . The Bahrain Petroleum Company also suggested that the Government should set up a department to en sure that there is proper conservation of the island's water supply. The Political Agent, together with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the General Manager of the Company, subsequently took the opportunity after the particularly uneconomical drilling of a well by one of the A1 Khalifah to press on the Shaikh the setting up of a proper water conservation committee, containing one or two geological experts from the Company, which would examine all applications for the drilling of new wells. This Committee has been set up and is functioning successfully. a. w mzmmm * Work on metalling the roads in Manamah has- 3 - made progress and a new public garden was opened on the Western side of the town (see paragraph 30(iii) of this report). The Kuharraq Muni cipality which had worked in a rented building moved into a new building which had been built for 6. PUBLIC 303K£ . 10 new shops ( an investment of His Highness the Shaikh) in the main street of the Manamah bazaar and a new Post Office and Police Station were completed during the year. Work was conjaenced on t e new offices for the Bahrain Government in the square opposite the Customs House. Progress was also made in constructing new quarters for the Nursing Sisters and in metalling the llanamah - Rafa road. The piped water system for llanamah which was begun by Messrs. Holloway Brothers in 1946 was completed towards the end of the year. 7. ELECTRICITY D PARTMEXT. Group Captain Leigh was succeeded by Mr.D.J. Brammer as State Engineer» Bahrain. Two small 66 K.W. sets and two 300 K.W. sets arrived and were installed during the year. A new 900 K.tf. set is also on order and should arrive late in 1949. The peak load carried was the highest on record and there were several shutdowns because of the strain entailed on the older generators. There are large new demands for electricity which cannot be met until the new equipment arrives and the Bahrain Government have been pressed to order more plant to meet it. The shortage of electricity was one of the causes of delay in installing the new automatic telephone system. 8 . 1BLEPH0KF DTPAHT^ENT . The total number of subscribers at the erd of the year was 129. Very little work on the existing magneto system was carried out because it was expected that the new automatic system would be in operation during the course of the year. This had been completed but had not yet come into operation at the end of the year because of objections by subscribers to a number of clauses in the subscriber's agreement; and parti cularly to that providing that they should pay for each individual call over a specified number allowed free ( 3 per day). The Shaikh had agreed to this provision with Messrs. Cable &lt;* Wireless Limited, but the Political Agent had to intervene with him before he would enforce it. Only after this was it possible to get the new system going. 9. TRA-^QRT UFPART.kTNX . There were 63 Government vehicles at the end of the year. A new foreman has been engaged and further reorganisation of the department will take place in 1949. io. szmjm-- 4 - io. mmm- In Jonuary a moating was hold at tho Advlserato to consldor ropopts that packets of Vene zuelan and Hod Sea pearls had boon sent to Bahrain pearl merchants for disposal* Tho mooting urged His Highness to take all measures possible, in conjunction with the Ruler of Saudi Arabia and other Rulers of Gulf States, to forbid the entry of foreign pearls into the Gulf. In April the Government of India lifted the ban it had imposed in 1947 on the import of foreign pearls into India* This was, however, not sufficient to revive the Bahrain pearling industry which is now moribund* The pearling fleet did not leave for the banks until after Ramadhan and the season was in consequence a very short one. There were even fewer boats than last year, only 37 large boats (boats carry ing over 100 divers) taking part, and tha total catch was estimated at a value of Rupees four to five lakhs, a further drop on last year's figure of rupees twenty- five lakhs and on the figure for the year before of rupees forty lakhs* The marketing prospects for Gulf pearls do not see© to be bright though the Export Promotion Department of the Board of Trade have from time to time forwarded information regarding them which has been passed to the Bahrain Government* u. Customs revenue from all sources amounted to Rs.60,74,343/-, an increase of Rs. 14,33,768/- over last year* The Increase was due to a steady Increase in the volume of imports, more goods being available for importers particularly from the United Kingdom* The total number of Bahrain boats registered by the Customs Department was 233. 4 new motor launches were built during the year* i 2 . miismm* During tha year the State curtailed its activities in the field of bulk buying of foodstuffs and reduced its expenditure on this account from Rs.113,00,000/- to Rs*71,00,000/-* This reduction resulted from the Ruler's agreeing to the request of the merchant community to leave the import of rice and sugar to private enterprise. These two commodities were then taken off the ration* Prices remained steady in the early part of the year but rose steeply in the latter half. The State intends to resume control of the import and distribution of rice end sugar in 1949 and has applied for a quota of rice fro® the Emergency Food Council* The State continued to . Import throughout the year and to ration the distri bution of wheat of which the supply was arranged by His Majesty's Government. The ration was maintained at 4 lbs. per adult head a month throughout tha year at slightly increased prices during the latter half* This local rise in price was due to an increase in the price of wheat in the supplying areas* 13. SHIP' ISG- 6 - 13. S.JLi-P-.g-0-S. ( 1 ) laaorts and Exports . A total of P63 freighters ar&gt;d 680 tankers called at Bahrain during 1948* there were 234 British, 176 Panamanian and 169 American vessels. Imports of general cargo were 103,880 tons and exports of general cargo 74,864 tons. Exports of petroleum products were 5,367,662 tons and 86,200 drums, and Imports of Arabian crude 138,241 tons. (11) landing of C anto . Gray Mackenzie 4 Company Limited, the Shipping Agents, have almost a monopoly of the landing of cargo here. There were again a number of complaints about their arrangements for landing at Sltrah and Kanamah, the delay in the transhipment of cargo from the former to the latter port, and the pilferage of cargo from barges waiting to be unloaded. Several meetings of the merchant community end representatives of the Bahrain Government and Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. were held during the year to consider these complaints when the Company representative stated that delay often took place at the swing bridge on the causeway between Manamah and Muharraq or at the Manamah pier where there was only one ancient hand crane to handle cargo. He also stated that his Company had discharged the less reliable of their tally staff and were attracting a better type of applicant by paying them higher wages (they are at present meeting a monthly bill of Rs. 20 , 000 /- for tally staff) and asked the Bahrain Government to provide guards on barges waiting to be unloaded. The Bahrain Government have been able to depute a number of police men for this duty and several pilferers have been caught as a result. They have also informed the Company that they have on order a new 10 ton 'Smiths' shunting crane which is expected to be shipped from the United Kingdom in June 1949 and which will greatly facilitate the handling of cargo at Manamah pier. Whether the expenses involved in improving the port facilities la Bahrain, particularly in building a deep water quay, would be Justified is a question. What seems certain is that Bahrain will lose some trade, at any rate, when the new ports now under construction in Saudi Arabia and Qatar are opened. 14. gQ ^T„ „amss. The administration of the Post Office at Bahrain was transferred on 1st April, 1948, from the Government of Pakistan to His Majesty^ Government and has since been conducted under the supervision of a British Postal Superintendent.

(1) &lt;&gt;ger.cy Courts. 1428 Civil Suits 9 298 Criminal Cases and 33 estate cases were dealt with by the Agency Courts during the year* There was one case of attempted murder f the accused, a seaman from a freighter which called at Bahrain, being sentenced to 5 years' rigorous imprisonment. In January, S.E.Yona, an Iraqi Jew, was sentenced to one year's Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1,000/- for embezzling a sum of Rs.4,000/- from the B.O./CRest House in Manamah where he was employed as a reception clerk. In November one Indian and one Persian merchant were each fined Rs.1,000/- for profiteering. (11) Local Courts . No major crime came before the Bahrain Courts this year, their time being taken up with Civil Suits and prosecutions for intoxication, being in the possession of liquor, and traffic offences. 16.

The local police cadets have now completed their three years of training and have been appointed Assistant Sub Inspectors of Police. They form a useful adjunct to the force and have been successful in apprehending a number of pilferers of ships' cargo awaiting unloading at Manamah pier. There were 357 theft cases as against 414 last year. There were also 8 smuggling cases end one case of suicide. There were....- 7 - There were 146 traffic accidents resulting in 3 deaths| as against 130, with 6 deaths, last year. A new police post was opened at the old Sitrah pier to check the operations of smugglers in the Oil Company's harbour area. 17. (a) Trade and Business . Trade flourished during the year but slackened somewhat in the late summer and early autumn. Many consumer goods of all types were imported from the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Holland, Australia, and India. The bazaars were well stocked and merchants did a large re-export trade to other ports in the Gulf. There was no sign, however, of any fall in prices while prices for 'luxury* articles like motor cars, bicycles, and radios increased in invoice values from the source of supply as much as 10^. The removal of controls from the prices of many articles resulted in large profits being made by many merchants. The extension of oil company operations in both Bahrain and the Arabian mainland brought a greeter volume of business to banks, shipping companies, and local business men. (b) Exchange and Currenc y. The rates of exchange remained substantially unchanged throughout the year. Bahrain is still given a quote for all hard currency countries (except Germany, Japan, and the Belgian Monetary Area) within which quota it is supDOsed to keep. Honey was again plentiful in the bazaar though Indian funds were almost non-existent. The influx of hundred rupees notes reported last year continued during 1948 and caused some inconvenience to local banks who could use only a small proportion of them for outside payments. Large numbers of Indian and Pakistani notes were repatriated, and many of them must have been smuggled into Bahrain. Local business transactions are still in Indian currency and its retention in preference to Pakistani currency caused some unfavourable consent and most tendentious reporting*in a Karachi newspaper. (c) Industry . The Bahrain Petroleum Company continued to produce and export a large volume of petroleum products but the pearling industry is moribund despite the lifting of the ban on the import of pearls into India. There are no other local Industries of importance. (&lt;*) Labour . There was a great demand for labour from the Oil Companies, the contractors engaged on the piped water scheme and automatic telephone schemes, and local British enterprises. High wages were paid all classes of labour. In Bahrain a skilled artisan was paid as much as Rs. 8 /- to Rs. 12 /- a day and he corananded even higher wages if he went to work on the mainland. Pearling operations....- 8 - operations did not draw off as many labourers as usual as few boats went out and the pearling season was short* Complaints were mad© to the Bahrain Government about the muster of foreigners, Indians, z'' Persians, Pakistanis, Omanis, and Qataris, who were obtaining employment in Bahrain at the expense of local labour* They were else asked to prevent Bahrainis fro® going abroad to work on the mainland but replied that the ban they had imposed in 1947 on the exodus of Bahrainis from Bahrain had proved very unpopular and had to be lifted soon after it was i®posec. Most Bahrainis prefer to work in Bahrain but the high wages being paid by /.ramco end Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd* led many abroad. Clerks were paid as much as Rs.300/- and Rs*40C/- per mensem by Aramco and those who worked for Arab contractors often received as much as Rs.60C/- to Rs*900/* a month* IS. (a) General . The general health of the communities has been good throughout the year* There have been no major epidemics* The incidence of malaria has been further reduced by the Anti-Malarial measures carried out by the Bahrain Government* A scheme has been implemented by the Bahrain Government to combat the alarmingly high incidence of venereal disease* This provides for free but compulsory treatment of all infected persons in Bahrein. There has been a favourable and rapid response from tie public. The Bahrain Medical Society at the end of its third year held a medical congress for Persian Gulf doctors on Rovember 4th. This, the first of its kind, was an experiment to see in what ways different doctor?, both British and American, were dealing with the problems of this area* 18 outside doctors attended and the meetings were a great success. It is hoped to make this an annual feature* An increasing number of persons have visited Bahrain from Saudi Arabia, the Trucial Coast, and Iran for medical treatment. (fc) Victoria M emorial Hospltel. The Victorial Memorial Hospital functioned under the auspices of the Government of India for the first 3 months of the year under review and during that period its role continued to embrace quarantine duties, the running of a public dispensary and a IB bedded hospital together with the medical attendarce on the staffs of the Residency and Agency, the personnel of ships' crews and the employees of certain local business firms. On the 1st April, the hospital was taken over by His Majesty's Governrrert end from that date the dispensary end hospital were closed down but the other activities continued. Major J.D.Grant, I.M.S. (Retd.) was appointed Quarantine Medical Officer o n the 7th 1 4 « (c) American Mission ISos-IIeI(c) American Mission Hospital. Number of out-door patients treated 69,879 ' w in-door ' w 1,653 M ' operations performed 2,307 (d) State Hospital . The lunatic asylum, formerly under the Manamah Baladiya, was taken over by the medical department at the beginning of the year and established on medical lines with a trained mental nurse from India in charge. 9 Pulmonary T.B. is being treated with greater success by long intensive courses over several months, phrenic avulsion, and artificial pneumo-thorax therapy. Pneumonia showed a 50^ Increased incidence and was of at* unusually toxic nature. Mortality was not hi^h but delayed resolution with delility very marked. The increasing number of patients from outside Bahrain is tending to cramp the hospital accommodation. 10# of inpatients were from Saudi Arabia, the Trucial Coast and Iran, particularly from the former. They come chiefly for operations usually for the eyes. Those of Saudi Arabia are always willing to pay high fees to be admitted, but the others are usually destitutes. MEN i OUTPATI'NTS .

In view of the heavy traffic at this port, this despensary will provide better facilities for quarantine supervision and the medical attendance on ships* crews. A part time Health Inspector has been appointed to carry out quarantine duties at Muharraq Airport. The work at the marine airport is still being done by the Customs Officer. However, it is now found that practically all air passengers ©re In possession of valid certificates of vaccination and inoculation. The supervision of crews engaged in dhow trsffic and passengers carried by such traffic presents the chief quarantine difficulty. Recently the Government of Bahrain has been requested to take action in the matter but It is considered that the proposed appointment of a Health Inspector to cover this work will test solve the problem. 19. BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED . (a) £ta££. Mr. R.M. Brown was the Chief Local Repre sentative throughout the year. From May to October he visited India and the United States when Mr.B. Crow, the Personal Assistant to the General Manager, acted for him. (b) Production . The total oil production during the year was 1,456,321 net tons of crude oil, an average of 3976 net tons a day. This is approximately 200,000 tons more than in 1947. The gas Injection of wells waswells was again an appreciable cause of the Increase especially in the early part of the year when the average daily production rose as high as 4,000 tons. (c) £j£yelg£££nt. One new well was completed during the year and a new point of withdrawal made in an existing well. Drilling operations on the deep test well begun in 1947 were continued throughout the year and are still in progress. Difficult drilling conditions made the rate of progress slow but valuable information is being accumulated. (d) jMPorts of Arabian American Cruda. Receipts of Arabian American Crude through the (A-B) submarine pipeline totalled 5,738,998 tons during the year and an additional 139,241 tons were received by tanker through Sitrah marine terminal, making a total of 5,878,239 tons received in the Refinery. (e) Exploration Work. Eight structure holes were drilled In the waters surrounding Hawar Island and five in the waters to the north of Bahrain and* Muharraq Islands in the general area of Fasht al Jarim. In order to obtain greater information plans were made early in the year to conduct a geophysical survey of the water covered areas of the additional area and arrangements made to obtain the necessary equipment and personnel. Actual operations were begun in December, 1948. (f) Befinery Operations . Operation of the Refinery was at a high level of throughput during 1948 and the total crude run amounted to7,279,569 tons. Product shipments were as followsi- Avlatlon Gasoline Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Fuel Fuel Oil Total 15,302 tons 1,725,698 ' . 728,091 « 1,201,386 « £ A 6g7» 78ft ' Of the above aviation gasoline 1,502 tons were of Bahrain manufacture and 10,466 tons were imported partly from the United States and partly from Abadan. The above crude running represented approxi mately a 19$ increase over 1947 operations, and was made possible by alterations to existing equipment and operation on an exacting shipping schedule. Cg) Refinery . Major facilities completed during the year were the installation and operation of a Thermal Reformer, the completion of the Reforemed Gasoline Lead Sulphide Sweetening plant, and the completion and placing in service of two wells connected with this plant. A number of minor alterations and additions to existing facilities were made or commended during 1948 and the improvements to the power kerosene • • •.both..«••. - 12 - # kerosene lesd sulphide treating plant beg^in In 1947 were completed and the plant put Into service. (h) S 1 t r a h * At Sltrah terminal product storage facilities have been increased by constructing 11 tanks which are all in service together with a new cutter stock pump, lines and services* At the causeway pierhead, launch berthing facilities for the offshore geophysical survey work being conducted by the Producing Department were installed and are in service* (i) Camp facilities* Staff housing accommodation was considerably increased during 1948., 133 family and 95 bachelor units being completed. An Executive Guest House was begun during the year and will be completed in 1949, when a further 74 family and 52 bachelor units are also scheduled to be completed. The Awsli boundary fence has been relocated towards the south to permit extension of the new housing area making the total area of Awali 390 acres. The X-Ray room and laboratory of the Awali Hospital were enlarged and extensive alterations made to the mess-hall kitchen. (j) EgDloyces.

No.4 well spudded in in 1947 was completed in February 1948 at a depth of 5790 feet. Foundations for 3 more wells have been completed. About 1800 tons of oil for camp needs were drawn from the producing wells. (b) New Construction. Work on the rehabilitation of Dukhan Camp was continued during the year and many new buildings13 both residential and industrial were erected. Qatari contractors working under the supervision of Company technicians were used upto the end of the year. The Umm Bab area has been selected as the residential area and the Industrial ares will be sited on the plateau about three quarters of a mile east of the nevt El Hamleh harbour. Work on a pilot jetty of 400 yards by 20 yards was begun at A1 Hamleh. Messrs. Holloway Brothers are building a trans-peninsular road which is expected to be ready by mid June of 1949. They have also completed about 60^ of the Umm Said Jetty. An air strip has been constructed at Umm Said and the first plane landed on it on the 18th November, 1948. (c) Employees .

Geophysical survey of the area fr^'is the Abu Dhabi Sabkha (Salt Marsh) westwards to longitude 62° 20* I and Southwards fro» the coast to a distance of 60 Kilometres was carried out during the months of January to April by the Robert H» Ray CoDpany* This survey was the continuation of work carried out in 1947. A less detailed survey of the Inland areas of the Abu Dhabi and Dubai Sheikhdoms was also carried out until the operations were wound up in April 1948. During the months of April end May, the cost at Je* el All and the creeks of Du&gt;al and Umm al Quwaln were surveyed \y Company personnel operating from U/h 'NASR' with a view to determining the most suitatle site for landing cargo brought in by Company vessels. The Umm el Quwain creek was eventually selected and has proved very satisfactory in this respect and the Company's vessel M/V 'JESGURA' discharged there its first cargo of vehicles and stores on the 29th Nov. Seismic operations have teen commenced by the Independent Prospecting Company who arrived on the True!a1 Coast at the end of November and started work in the Jebel All area and southwards.

On the 13tb January the Right Honourable Mr.ANTHONY EDEN, M.C., J.P., arrived in Bahrain by air from Abadan. He was accompanied by hi* son NICHOLAS and COLONEL PALkIEH. His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain gave Mr.EHFN a very warn welcome and entertained him to lunch at the Qudhaibiyah Palace. Mr.EDEN also attended a cock tail party at the Political Agency and dined with the Political Resident. He and his party left for Riyadh on the 14th in an ARAMCO aircraft, accompanied by Shaikh MOUSTAPRA HAFIZ WAHBA who arrived early in the morning to meet him. There were many other visitors to Bahrain during the year most of them connected, more or less remotedly with oil. 28. 4]1 P.,EAL^2:i??£. In January the Bahrain Government informed the Agency that owing to the antl-Jewish riots of 1947 they did not wish visas for Bahrain to be Issued to active Zionists, Jewish refugees, or Jews not in Bahrain on definite business. In April the Bahrain Palestine Air Committee appealed for contributions to the Bahrain Government and local European firms and asked them to bring their appeal to the notice of their employees. On the advice of the Political authorities no action was taken on the appeal and Shaikh Abdullah, the president of the Committee, was advised privately that no official contribution could be expected from any member of an European firm. Feeling against Jews and those supposed to be the active supporters of the Zionist cause often ran high and when the U.S.S. w Rendova' visited Bahrain in Hay a number of Arab notables refused to attend a tee party on board because *they could not accept hospitality from the country which had recognised Israel as a Sovereign State* 1 • Local Jews deemed it politic to associate themselves with this statement and to subscribe to Arab Funds in aid of Palestine and there were no further Antl-Jewlsh incidents, though both the Bahrain Government end the Persian Gulf Squadron of the Royal Navy were fully prepared at the time of the termination by the United Kingdom of the Palestine Mandate in May to prevent any recurrence of last year’s rioting. The news of the invasion of Palestine by the Arab Armies was received with jubilation but enthusiasm waned with the slow progress and the repulses suffered by these armies, and the ensuing military and political stalemate, and finally lapsed into an attitude of callous indifference towards the fate of the Palestinean Arab Refugees. Some efforts were made at the end of the year by....by a coBiBiittee of local merchants to collect money and wearing apparel for the Palestinean refugees who had been settled near Basrah. Local Cinemas are still collecting a 'Palestine' charge of one anna from the buyer of every ticket. His Highness contributed Rs.10,000/- in March towards the Palestine Aid Fund. 29. m . nMU * (i) Some stir was created in the beginning of the year by the publicity given by the Haifa and Tehran broadcasting stations to the arrival in Tehran and the subsequent activities of Abdullah Az Zalrahy a young Bahraini adventurery who claimed to have been entrusted with a message from the 'Bahrain National Party' to the effect that the people of Bahrain were anxious to be reunited to Persia. His Highness promptly denied Abdullah Az Zalrah's claim to represent the people of Bahrain and asked that Haifa and the British Broadcasting Corporation should i?sue counter statements /is that Bahrain was and still/an independent Arab State in treaty relation with h£s Majesty’s Government. In this His Highness was supported by the 'Onion of Youth' of Bahrain who sent a telegram to Reuters expressing their resentment at Abdullah Az Zairah’s impertinence. The latter was subsequently credited with writing a series of articles for the Tehran Newspaper 'Iran-i-Ma' and, still later, with the making of preparations to visit America/ and present the Persian claim to Bahrain to the United Nations Assembly. »hen last heard of f however, he was eking out a living in a minor post in the Saudi Embassy at Tehran and had been dropped by Abbas Iskandari and other Persian deputees concerned In pressing the Persian claim to Bahrain. (ii) The Tehran Radio continued to carry references to Persia’s claim to Bahrain which often disturbed His Highness and led him to ask why no denials and counter statements were issued by the and in September he was further agitated by an Arab broadcast from Paris that the Shah had taken advantage of his visit to the United Kingdom to arrange with His Majesty's Government for the Bahrain Islands to be handed over to Iran. At the end of the year these various rumours had ri so worked upon the Shaikh that he asked that he be given an assurance by His Majesty's Government that it would protect Bahrain against external aggression. (ill) In March the Persian Government Instructed the Bushire Post Office not to receive or re-transmit any telegram of Bahrain origin. Of more concern was a scarcity of meat in February caused by the restrictions imposed by the Pe:sian Government on the export of livestock and other commodities. With the payment by exporters of larger bribes to Persian Officials, the restrictions were set aside and the supply of livestock to Bahrein was resumed. 30. IIS. S OF IN IF REST . (i) Visit of local merchants to^£^ isil . industries fair. In April three local merchants, Messrs. Khal?d Aujan, the British and American Tobacco Company Agert,-19 Abdur Rahman Hohammed Tahir, and Mohammed all bln Mohammed Tahir al Sharif, left for the United King dom to visit the British Industries Fair, They also visited France, Italy, Switzerland, Holland, end Egypt, Messrs, Khalld Aujan and Abdur Kshman Mohammed Tahir returned to Bahrain in August, Mohammed All Al Sharif had not returned at the end of year, (il) Bahrain Cinemas , In July the 'Pearl Cinema' a modern luxry cinema, owned by one of the Gosaibi Brothers, Saudi merchants long established in Bahrain, was opened to the public. The cinema seats over 700 persons and boasts of an air-conditioning unit which, owing to the electricity shortage, could not be used in 1948. Manamah town has now three local cinema houses and one nearing completion and iluharraq one local cinema house, (m) '*ater Garden' . In August, the opening of a new 'Water Garden' outside Manamah town was celebrated with an aquacade arranged by Mr.Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, for which nearly every departrent of the Bahrain Government was pressed into service. The garden has been constructed by the reclacatlon and filling in of some marshy land to make two artificial lakes and the cost is said to have exceeded Rs.10,000/-. It is now never used. Uv) Liawor . There is a large amount of liquor both Imported and locally manufactured to be bought on the black market and Bahrainis of all classes are fond of Alcohol. His Highness, however, has not yet been able to over-come his own and others rooted objection to the overt drinking of liquor by Bahrainis and his Muslim subjects still labour under total prohibition. In September one of the shops imported and was allowed to sell a consignment of apple cider to the public but it brought forth such a fulmination from the Qadhi of the Friday mosque that His Highness made haste to issue an 'Ahlan' forbidding its further sale, (v) Renta . Despite much new building, rents are still very high and the finding of good accommodation at not too exhcbitant a rent is difficult. Ris Highness, who is a large owner of house property, would like to deal with this situation by raising rents still higher, which he ingeniously suggests, would encourage more new building of residential quarters. In November a committee appointed by the Political Agent and presided over by the Assistant Political Agent met at the Agency to consider a 41 to 61 increase on the value of the property in the existing rent rate. They found, however, that this would make, in fact, for increased inflation and a resultant demand for increased wages, and concluded that an increase in the rent rate was only possible if houses were to be reassessed excluding the value of the site. 31. jEh/Il.S'R.-SC SI.

This old man (reputed to be 84 years of age) remained surprisingly well during the year* His grip on the affairs of his barbarous Sheikdom remains unimpaired and unyielding though, when relaxed, he lapses into a ch^ld like senility* The death of his otherwise unloved and unlovable son, Hamad, affected him deeply* In May the Shaikh contributed Rs.1,00,000/- to a fund for helping Arab Refugees from Palestine. His son Shaikh Hamad contributed Rs.30,000/-. (ID Ihe Catsr Succession. In May Shaikh Hamad, the second son and heir- apparent of the Ruler, died in the hospital at Dukhan of Messrs* Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited* Shaikh Hamad who was a chronic diabetic, obese, and in poor general health, was taken ill early in May with a fever and diarrhoea* After treatment by an Indian doctor he was removed by Dr.Anderson, the Company^ Chief Medical Officer, to Dukhan where he warned to be progressing favourably but had a relapse towards the end of the month and died on the 27th May* His death was dlagonlsed as due to heart failure and toxaemia following an attach of sysentery* Shaikh Abdullah was faced with the difficult question of choosing a successor.Shaikh All, his eldest son, has always been regarded as a person of weak intellect and has hitherto lived the life of e complete nonentity* Only a fortnight after Shaikh Hamad 1 s death, however, his eldest son Shaikh Abdul Aziz died at Karachi while on a visit there. Shaikh Abdullah was thus left to choose between Shaikh All and the second son of Shaikh Hamad, Shaikh Khalifah, a youth of 18 and a minor. The decision exercised his $lnd for some months but in November he announced that All was to be his successor and Khalifah to be second in the line of succession* This decision was announced before a meeting of Qatar notables whom he got to sign a document that they approved of Shaikh Abdullah*s decision and recognised the succession as announced by him* am Zrsgrgps Afther the war the oil company was handicapped for a time by a scarcity of technicians and proper equipment but in the year 1948 they made appreciable progress. A brief account of their activities is at paragraph 20 of this report* Being largely a British Company, Petroleum Con cessions Limited have only a limited dupply of dollars and are so compelled to concentrate their efforts and resources on essentials.

This comes in ^or criticise and results in a large turnover of discontented staff. * The Company's impact upon the State has been what one expects and as seen in other places* tut accentuated In Qatar because it is so primitive. The Shai h and what corresponds to 'Governmental circles ,, look to the oil company as the universal provider! his subjects* and many immigrants* rely upon it for a living and* whether originally Bedouin* fisherman pearler or porter become very soon oil company hands dressed in oily khaki European clothes* and carrying their lunch in cans to work* while they interlard their speech with what are or what they imagine to be English expressions. dr) One of the benefits that is likely to result from the further opening up of Qat&amp;r to foreign enterprise is the gradual suspension end the eventual abolition of the activities of slave traders in that territory. Qatar provided a ready market during the year under review for slaves kidnapped or sold on the Truciel Coast. Several letters of protest were addressed to the Ruler and in three instances the Political Agent was successful in effecting the restore tion of slaves who had been taken to Qatar by their captors. 33. mjcuL cwi .

Mr. J.A. Roche was Station Manager until the 1st August when he handed over to Mr.P.W.Coultard. On the £2nd October Mr.Coultard handed over to Mr.E.J. Palmer. (iii) Shipping . During the period under report 41 ships called at Sharjah and 60 ships at Dubai. ( lv ) The golden VsHey Qthr« ard Oxide. Co. Mining for red oxide on Abu Musa Island was continued until the PPnd Jvne. During the year under review minin’ for red oxide was also commenced on Sir Bu Nai'r Island. 2900 tons of red oxide from the former and 2300 tons from the latter were shipped to England on S.S. W SERBISTAH M which sailed on the 22nd June. During the year under review, Kr.F.Innes Pocock of Messrs.Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company Limited visited Abu Dhabi and, after obtaining Shaikh ShakhbuVs permission, proceeded to Sir Beni las and Dalmah Islands for the purpose of prospecting for red oxide there. He took specimens for examination but the result is not yet known. Mr. D ocock left for the United Kingdom on the 23rd June. In early November he telegraphed to Khan Sahib Husain Airad instructing him to recruit labour and recoumence mining red oxide on Abu Musa and Sir Bu flei’r Islands. Work is in progress in both places. Cn the 29th April Mr.C.Moore, Administrative Officer, Middle East Anti-Locust Unit, arrived at Shsrjah. He disposed of all the saleable stores of the Middle Fast Anti-Locust Unit at Sharjah and destroyed locust poison bait. He left Sharjah for Bahrain on the ?th May. 7.

On the 27th January His Excellency Saud tin Abduilah Mn Jiluwi, Amir of Hcsa, arrived at Sharjah by a Saudi aircraft on his way to India for medical trert;:.et;t. He was met at the aerodrome by the Shaikh of Sharjah and was visited Vy Sharjah and Dubai notables and also by Shaikh Rashid bin Sai*d. He left for India next morning. On the 16th March Mr. Wilfred Thesiger, D.S.O.. arrived at Abu Dhabi by camel from the Kadhramaut. He left Abu Dhabi for Buraisi on the 1st April and arrived at Sharjah from Buraimi on the 10th fcay. He left for Bahrain by a sailing boat on the 19th May. On the 20th October he arrived at Sharjah from Bahrrln by air and on the 26th left for Abu Dhabi whence he proceeded by camel to Buraiml, Liwa and Bainuna areas. On the 8th October Kis Highness the r^awab of Bhopal and Her Highness the Begum passed through Sharjah on uheir way to the Hadjez for pilgrimage. The Residency Agent met Their Highnesses at the aerodrome. On the 4th November Their Highnesses again passed through Sharjah on their way back to India. They were met at the aerodrome by the Shaikh of Sharjah. On the 2nd Deces.b$r f Air Comaedore Towsey, Lieut. Colonel^Lonsdalc, 4’ing Commander Douglas and Mr. T. Jones of B.M.15.Q., arrived at Sharjah by air and left on the 6th. On th&lt;j 15th December, Col # Bertraa Thomas, C.M.G., Arab Adviser to/Shell Group, arrived at Sharjah, to renew his friendship with the Trucial Shaikhs. He visited Dubai, Abu Dhobi, Ras al Thai^ah and Dram al Qaiw&amp;ln. He left for Kuwait by steamer on the 23rd December. 36. POSTAL SERVICES . On the 11th February Mr.H.C.Breach.Superintendent, British Post Offices, Persian Gulf, arrived at Sharjah in connection with the taking over of postal services in Dubai from the Pakistan Govern ment • With effect from the 1st April, H.M.G. took over the administration of the postal services in Dubai from the Pakistan Government and British stamps of various denominations over-printed with Indian currency value were introduced. The Royal Air Force duty aircraft continued to carry the mail once a week between Dubai and Bahrain. (1) Dubai - &gt;Vcu Dhabi O l sfut. . The economic sanctions inrooswd on Abu Dhabi continued till the 29th April when a settlement of the dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi was arrived at. On the 22nd April the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi sent a deputation to Sharjah composed of his brother Hazza 1 and Zayid and his materne1 uncle Hamid bin Butl, to see the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and discuss the possibilities of a settlement with Dubai over the question of Abu Dhabi allies. Negotiations took place between both sides in the Agency in the presence of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and a settlementwas arrived at which was acceptable to both sides. The question of camels which the Ruler of Abu Dhebi claimed to have been on deposit with the Manaslr and captured by Dubai during their raid against the Manaslr last year was referred to the Ruler of Umm ai Qtweln for arbitration. At the end of the year this matter had not yet been finally settled. \ A small pcirty of the Manasir later raided Dulai but were heavily defeated ;md consequently the Manasir themselves- made peace with Dubai and their relations have since been friendly. After peace had been con cluded large numbers of the Manasir and their chief visited Dubai and received lavish presents in cash and kind from Shaikh Rashid bln Bal’d. It is believed that Shaikh Rashid instigated the Uanasir to dissent from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and prevent the Oil Company from working in their area. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi complained to the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, against Rashid’s harmful activities and the Political Officer, Trucial Coast warned Rashid against deliberate trouble-making. Dubai made peace with the other tribes who were hostile to them. (li) The Res al KhaUah coup d'etat i In early February Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad bin Salim, third nephew of Sultan bin Salim, the ex-Shai^h of Has al Khaimah, seized the town of Ras al Kheimah with the consent of the inhabitants and with the aid of the Khawatir tribe without bloodshed. Sultan bin Salim was at the time in Dubai where he has a wife and house. Sultan bin Salim made no genuine effort to re-capture the town, fils chief concern wes to get a sufficient allowance from his nephew. Hegotiations through the Shaikh of Shprjah produced no result as Sultan bin Salim had, in the meantime been intriguing against his nephew and Instigating theKhawatlr and other trites against his* Having accepted certain conditions and obligations Sheikh Saqr tin Kuhaxicad w^s formally recognised ty H*^*G* as Rnler of Hss al Kh&amp;lrrah on the 16th July* A solute of three guns was later accorded to him. Sultan bin SaliiX #ho made Dubai his permanent residence, intensified his intrigues against the new Shaikh and went to Dhald several times where he collec ted round himself a number of robbers from various tribes in order to harass his nephew. Although he was warned ty the Political Officer, Irueial Coast, to refrain from doing so, he did not actually comply tut went secretly to Has al Khaiaah and occupied his g f-den there. He was immedl tely turned out by his nephew who complained against hi^ to the Political Agent* The °olltical Agent called Sultan bin Salim and asked him for an explanation for this bad behaviour but he gave him no satisfaction. On trying to take him to Bahrain by a sloop to spend some time there in exile, Sultan bin Salim disobeyed the order and escaped and fired on the Political Agent and the Residency Agert with a pistol which he had hidden in his clothes* tie was afforded asylum by the Shaikh of Sharjah^ brother with the Shaikh of Sharjah*s connivance and arrange ments were made for him next morning to leave for the desert. At last he went to Nanai' and took shelter there until the end of the year* All the Trucial Coast Shaikhs were asked by the Political Agent to arrest Sultan bin Salim if he entered their territory*/ Shaikh of Sharjah*s brother was ordered to leave for Bahrain, where he spent three weeks, as a punishment for sheltering Sultan bin Salim in his house, and economic sanctions were imposed on the Shaikh of Sharjah, which continued till the end of the year, for disobeying the orders for thearrest of Sultan bln Salim. Sultan bin Salim went to Muscat and requested the Sultan of Muscat tc intervene for his with H.M.O* The result of the Sultan’s interventions was still not apparent at the end of the year* (iii) fjalU t In early Jamury the people of Khaur Fa^kan, iiubarah and buliyah, three dependencies under the Shaikhdoro of Kalba and the Raqihyeen tribe renounced the authority of the Regent and his nefbew Humaid bin Abdullah, turned out their guards and held the fort, towers and other important positions. They then sent a representation to the Residency Agent saying that they no longer wanted Shaikh Khalid to be Regent and requested that another capable person be appointed. The Political Agent and the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, then visited Kheur Fwkkwn and Kalta and personally heard the complaints of the people and their grievances. The people later chose Shaikh Humsid bin Muhammad of Rai al JChainra to be the new Regent but in early July, before the matter could finally be decided, the Regent end his ne hew, with the help of the Shaikh of Fujairah, entered the belligerent port of Khaur Fskkan without opposition and captured the Fort and all other strategic points. One man was killed and three others wounded. The Chief of the Naqibyeen tribe fled to Sharjah but was later allowed to return to his own place* The Recent and his nephew once again established their authority over those areas which remained aulot till the end of the year*The Agreement covering the Kalba Landing Ground which expired on the 27th August 1948 was allowed to lapse as neither the Royal Air Force nor the British Overseas Airways Corpor tion required sir facilities in Kalba* (iv) Buraiml. In June Sayid Ahaad bin Ibrahi:, Minister for Internal Affairs to the Muscat Governraent, toured the Buraiai and Dhahirah areas. Re met the various tribal chiefs there and conducted a serlds of discussions with them. His object was to bring those chieft under the Sultan 1 s influence with a view to paving the v?ay for the Oil Company’s explorations in those areas. He has, however, achieved no tangible success as the important chiefs authorised Shaikh Saqr bin oultan, Chief of the tai 1 m, to represent them and arrange matters for them in consultation with the Sultan. 3aqr was, however, very reluctant to go to Muscat and meet the hultan and thus no result has really been achieved. Many Buraimi Chiefs visited Muscat and obtained handsome largesse from the Sultan. The ’V^di el Jlz?A road was repaired by the iniscat Government andmade passable to motor traffic. ( v ) Tribal feuds . During the year under report hostilities between the Beni Qitab tribe and the Sharqiyeen tribe and between the Beni Qitafc and the Awamir over camel looting started but came to an end. Casualties on both sides were negligible. Hostilities between the Beni Oitab ard the Hri 1 ^ over camel looting also started in December butwere *&gt;ot settled till the end of the year. (vi) Boundarie s* The Rulers of Dub&amp;i and Abu Dhabi signified • their agreement tc E.tf.O’s arbitrating in their boundary dispute. Preliminary action was taken to deal with this matter and both Shaikh* were asked to state the boundaries they claimed and produce any evidence they have in supoort of their claim. Sisvery i During the year under report, abduction of persons into slavery from Sharjah, Dubai and other parts of the True!*1 Const end the Batineh continued on an increased scale. Inspite of strong representations, the responsible Shaikhs took no effective measures to put an end to the practice. In point of fact it was the Shaikhs’ relaives who indulged in this trade rnd encouraged it. A comprehensive report or. the subject ras submitted by the Political Officer, Crucial Const, to the Political Agent, in which certain action was r&lt; commended. (viil) Piracy. There has been no complaint against any of the subjects of the True!el Sheikhdoms of their having en -a^ed in piracy during the year.A number of Trucial Coast dhows were boarded by Iranian patrols in Iranian waters and the Persian and Indian Rupee currency found on board was con fiscated, Complaints to the appropriate Iranian authorities were lodged but no result was achieved, (ix) Economic * Trade has been depressed throughout the year. Exports to Persian continued to decrease and many Trucial Coast subjects have gone to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait in search of work. During the early cart of the year there was distress on the Xrucial Const as the price of dates, which constituted the main diet of the people, went very high and was soon followed by a scarcity of rice owing to the very strict measures taken by the Iranian authorities, - Iran being the main source of supply to the Trucial Coast - against its export. The situation was, however, considerally relieved when the price of dates dropped to a reasonable limit end imports of dates from Iran and Iraq continued. During the latter part of the year sufficient quantities of rice arrived from Persia and Aden (the latter being Egyptian rice) and the food situation was satisfactory. The pearl trade was good - better than the previous years. The lifting of the ban by the Govern ment of India cn the entry of pearls into India was received with satisfaction. The catch of pearls obtained during the two parts of the diving season was worth about'Rs.2,000,000/-. (x) Communic ati ons: The motor tract between Dubai and fcoiscat through the Wadi el Qaur was in constant use by taxis taking passengers and goods to and fro, host of the trucks used were unserviceable surplus military vehicles sold by the Royal Air Force and put to use again by the local people* Security on the way was fair.
