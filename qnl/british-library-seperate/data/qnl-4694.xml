Other companies involved include the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO), California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC), and the shipping agents Gray, Mackenzie and Company Limited. It therefore includes correspondence on the topic between the Bahrain Political Agent, and either the Residency Agent or the Political Officer for the Trucial Coast. The file also covers the sale of the pickup in 1946, and its replacement with a new Ford Super Deluxe model.Folio 44 includes sketch diagrams of spring shackles (Nos. 3 and 4) dated 24 March 1945, required to repair the pickup. Additionally, a brief update — dated 20 September 1945 — on the Trucial Coast Shaikhs, and local VJ [Victory of Japan] Day celebrations can be found on folios 49-50; the update being provided by the Residency Agent based in Sharjah.The Arabic language content consists of four folios (28-31) detailing expenditure on the Agency building in Sharjah, including the construction of a garage for the pickup truck.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Khalil Bin Ebrahim Kanoo, automobile trading company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Pickup trucks</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000167#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000167#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000167#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000167#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000167#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
