Many thanks for your successful peace-making between the two Shaikhs. As you know, so long as the aborigines of the Trucial Coast confine their quarrels to the hinterland, their raids and counter-raids are no concern of ours: in fact these activities may almost be said to be a sort of safety- v alve, and take the place of League matches and cinemas and so forth in more civilised areas. When, however, their bickerings show signs of being fought out in the coastal ports where British interests are involved, more especially in Sharjah, where we have our Air Port, we have to intervene, and I am very glad your intervention was so successful. 3. I was also glad to see from your Report that Isa, the Residency Agent, on whose actions, or inactions, dark suspicions have from time to time been cast, on this occasion at any rate played up well. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Commander- in-Chief, and - with a copy of the relevant paragraph from your Report - to Eraser-Tytler, and to Laithwaite of the India Office Captain J.V.Creagh,D.S.0.,R.N., Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, H.M.S.

The revival of a blood feud dating back to about 1920 was threatening to develop into a War between 0 arjah and A1 Ajman, three subjects of the latter Shaikhdom having recently^fired at (but missed) Shaikh Rachmum, the faoher-in-law of the Shaikh of Sharjah whilst being received by him at his house, after which they rode off. 1 ^ Le Shaikh of Sharjah who complained said that Ajman lad tm eatened him and had many Bedouin allies whilst the latter informed me that he himself had given the order to fire and whatever happened intended to attack Shaikh Rachmum and knew that it meant war between Ajman and Sharjah. As there were a number of British subjects in both Sheikhdoms and the Imperial Airways Aerodrome and Rest House was at oharjah it seemed something had to be done about the matter. Alter lengthy and protracted interviews and the consumption 01 considerable quantities of sherbet and coffee and sweet meats combined with a little forceful persuasion a meeting oi the two ruling Shaikhs was arranged at which they rubbed noses and over clasped hands and in the name of Allah made a solemn declaration that no further quarrelling would take place for a periodof 4 months during which time negotiations would be entered into with a view to concluding a formal and peace \, service s of the Residency Agent (Khan in^arran^f^ A ^ dul La tif, 0.3.E.) were of great assistance m arranging the truce.

I gave a warning to Isa, (paragraph 3 of my letter of 31st August),and left* (b) Thereafter I received satisfactory reports of the progress of the work on the Rest House from Imperial Airways and R#A.F.authorities (vide my letter No#697-S of 23rd September, and printed letter No6?43-S of 3rd October). * J.

Failing this, however, the arrangement by the Royal Air Force of sending an Arabic speaking R.A.F.officer to assist Mackay, and carry on during the latter*s'absences, would seem to be the best possible substitute. Loch, the Political Agent, Bahrain, has alreadyalready visited Shargaii, ( I enclose a copy of his report), and will again visit the place as opportunity offers. 4 With regard to Isa, my views are contained in para graphs 6 and 10 of my D.O.JNo.869-S of 18th November, and with regard to the difficulties which Mackey has met, in paragraph 10 of the seme D.O, Briefly these difficulties are more or less what might be expected considering local conditions on the Trucial Coast, and on the whole I am surprised that the obstructions have not beeu more serious. 5. 3y the way it seems to me that if before approaching the India Office the Air Ministry had waited to find out from their representative on the spot, the Air Officer Commanding, ’Iraq, what action he was taking locally with me, a certain amount of trouble might have been saved to all concerned. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe.COPY* SECRET o D.O*NOo 1/S. 10604/2. AIR HEADQUARTERS, 2RHQ COMMAND, HINAIDI. 7th Ncsr ember 1932. My dear Eowle, I send you herewith a report written by Captain K. Mackay, Royal Engineers, on the subject of his relations with Khan Bahadur I»a bin Abdul Latif, Shaikh Sultan of Shargah and other notables on the Trucial Coast* 2, The events narrated will doubtless be familiar to you up to the date when you visited Shargah at my request on 30th August, 1932. In your despatch C-21 of 3lit August 1932 on this subject, you stated that you had informed the Residency Agent that if obstructions and delays continued, you would be compelled to assume that either he was being obstructive or that his influence was insufficient to be of use to us. Captain Mackay now maintains that the Khan Bahadur is continuing his obstructive tactics. His conclusions are admittedly based to some extent on hearsay evidence; he does not speak Arabic and is dependent on Natha Singh for much of his information. But it would be difficult to account for the course of events in any other way. It is perfectly natural that Isa should resent the diminution of his power and influence which Captain Mackay’s arrival and your subsequent visit have entailed, together with the consequent reduction in his opportunities for personal profit. 4 # It is, in any case, clear that the construction of the Rest House is not progressing smoothly. Apart from the matters dealt with in paras.23 - 25, which may be considered as having arisen prior to your visit, it is disturbing to find that difficulties occur when Captain Mackay absents himself from Shargah (para. 26 of the report). Since then. Captain Mackay has again visited Baghdad and during his absence, the owners of the hired lorry have declined to continue work at the rates fixed by him as fair and reasonable. One is being driven to the conclusion that the work will not proceed at a reason- able speed unless Captain Mackay himself remains on the spot • 5. It was originally hoped that it would not be necessary for Captain Mackay to do more than pay periodical visits to Shargah in order to check and report progress and exercise the necessary supervision. While I have no doubt that the work would be eventually completed under these conditions, there is now good reason to fear that it would take very much longer and be very much more expensive unless Captain Mackay stays more or less permanently at Shargah. On the other hand, I am finding it very inconvenient ... Lt.-Colonel T.C*Powle,C.B.E., The Hon*ble Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Residency, Bushire.V — — !■ I III - 2 - inconvenient to have one of my few Engineer officers absent from his proper work so long; had we been able to foresee the position that has arisen, I would certainly have asked for another officer to be sent out from home. There is another aspect of the matter that I would invite you to consider# Captain Mackay is finding it extremely difficult to confine himself to the technice.j suptji- vision of the Rest House construction, and is being drawn more and more into the sphere of politics. In order to ensure economy and expedition, he has been forced to have dealings with the Shaikh which under other circumstances would have been conducted through the Residency Agent. There are others who now prefer to deal with him rather than with Isa. So long as he is the only British officer there, this seems inevitable, but it is not a position that he likes, nor one that either you or I would care to continue if it were avoidable. 7, I cannot help feeling that the time has arrived for serious consideration to be given to the replacement of the Residency Agent by a British Political Officer. I hope you will not consider this suggestion an unwarranted in cursion into a sphere with which I have no concern, and that you appreciate the reasons which have prompted me in making it. Even wfere it found possible for a British Political Officer to stay for, say, a month at Shargah, I feel sure he would be able, with his knowledge of Arabic, to arrive at a correct conclusion as to Isa's present attitude and would be able to give you a sound recommendation as to the desirability or otherwise of retaining him in his present post. I hope to be able to come down to Kuwait during your visit there between 21st and 25th November, and we could perhaps discuss the question further. Yours sincerely. sd/- C. L. Courtney.COPY* SECRET . Do0 o Ho.869-S of 1932. The Residency, Bushire, the 18th November $932* Please refer to your D.O.no. l/S. 10604/2 of 7th November. We can discuss the matter, as you suggest, when we meet at Kuwait* In the meantime, however, it may be as well to put something on paper as an additional basis for discussion* 2* I have not been able to go through Mackay’s long report in detail as I have been rather busy lately with a tour to Muscat, etc* However, the following comments occur to me. Paragraphs 1-24 of Mackay’s report would appear to deal with matters previous to my visit to Shargah at the end of August, when I made arrangements which were satis factory to Mackay - vide my despatch No*C-21 of 31st August. I don’t know, therefore, that any remarks of mine are needed on this part of Mackay’s report* 3. The next item that Mackay takes up is that of the lorry employed by him, or the Shaikh, to carry stones, and building material for the Rest House, (paragraph 25). The lorry apparently is the property of a local syndicate, in the profits of which Mackay states Isa is a partner. Mackay complains of the syndicate’s original rates of transport. All syndicates, even British ones I , charge as high rates as possible for their services; it is merely a matter of business, and it is up to the individual using these services to * .«. Air Commodore C.l.Courtney, C.B.E., 1).o.0 Baghdad.L - 2 - to try and get their rates reduced; which is what Mackay did# At the end of paragraph 25 he states that he reported the matter to Isa and a new contract, presumably approved of by Mackay, was signed. 4# In the first part of paragraph 26 Mackay repeats various statements of the Shaikh res statements of Isa’s air men about him - Mackay# I think that Mackay attaches undue importance to these stories. Every British official working in the East has at one time or another stories spread about him, and if one spent one’s time in attending to them one would never get one’s work done. What one generally does is to ignore them# 5# Further on in the same paragraph Mackay refers to the fact that the Shaikhs of Debai and Ras-al-Khaimah were being obstructives the former in forbidding his dhows to fetch stones and stores to Shargah, and the latter in placing a tax on all dhows fetching stone from Tamb island, although no tax was placed on the stones taken from elsewhere# With regard to Ras~al-Khaimah, Mackay approached Isa who said he would put the matter right, and from what Mackay told me the other day in Muscat, I gather that the matter has been put right# With regard to Debai Mackay states he went and saw the Shaikh, who has withdrawn his prohibitive order# 6# I really cannot see that Isa can be held responsible for the iniquities of Debai and Ras-al-Khaimah, more especially as these difficulties were overcome, with Ras-al-Khaimah at least, through Isa’s intervention# Both the Shaikhs of Debai and Ras.al-Khaimah, quite apart from the fact that they naturally - from their point of view - want to make as much as • •...-3- aa possible out of the building of the Rest House,are hostile enough to the Shaikh of Shargah, without being instigated thereto by Isa, or anybody else* Both Debai and Raa~*l- Lhairaah had opportunities of making their towns the Trucial Coast stage for the Imperial Airways* These opportunities they refused to take, and now to their mortification they see that Shargah is reaping the harvest which they might have gathered. There is good reason to believe also that there was a general anti-air-facilities pact amongst the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast, and Shargah - having broken this pact - is looked upon as a black-leg. Quite without any instiga tion from Isa, therefore, these two Shaikhs will do their best by underhand intrigues to annoy Shargah and delay the building of the Rest House. The flifficulties which M&amp;ckay has met from these two Shaikhs, and which Mackay has apparently been able to overcome, would appear to be the natural outcome of the local situation. 7. With regard to the necessity which you mention in your paragraphs 4-5, of Mackay having to stay more or less permanently at Shargah, I must say that it has always been my opinion that he would have to do so, if the work, under the local conditions prevailing, were to proceed with reasonable celerity. Apart from the question of works supervision, there is also the question of the superintendence of the large sums of money which pass through the Shaikh’s hands for the building of the Rest House. Mackay objected to these sums passing through the hands of the Residency Agent and so arrangements were made, as detailed in my despatch quoted above, for the money to be paid to the Shaikh under the supervision of Mackay himself, who is the officer on the spot resp onsible • • * •4 responsible for the building of the Rest House# In these circumstances it certainly seems necessary that Mackay should be on the spot to see that the money is properly spent# 8# In regard to your paragraph 6, I quite agree that it is most undesirable for Hackay to be drawn into local politics, and I venture to suggest that he might be instructed to confine his energies to matters concerned with his work# If individuals approach him on other subjects, the best line for him to take would be to inform them that he has nothing to do with their local politics or grievances# 9# tfith regard to the suggestion contained in your para graph 7# I am always glad to receive suggestions from any quarter, and am of course only too anxious to assist you in every way# There are, however, practical difficulties against sending a British political officer to Shargah# Amongst others there is no one at present whom I can spare# Since the in auguration of the Imperial Airways, however, the Political Agent, Bahrain, is within easy distance of Shargah, and I will ask him to fly down there from time to time and see what he can do to help on matters# He will not be able to go just for the moment* Loch, the new Political Agent, Bahrain, arrives in a few days, and will be busy taking over from Prior. 10# To sum up# It seems to me that Mackay is under the illusion that the inhabitants of the Trucial Coast are all * out * t o help him in every way, and to give their services and material as cheap as possible, and are only hindered in these philanthropic aims by the machinations of Isa. This of course is far from being the correct picture# Apart from the people of Shargah itself, who benefit directly and indirectly by their town • • • •town becoming the Imperial Airways stage, there is - first - a strong feeling in the other Trucial Coast Shaikhdoras - a s ^ have explained above - against Shargah being the Imperial Airways port of call, and — secondly - there is the perfectly natural feeling that the most should be made of a golden opportunity of making as much money as possible. If Mackay were undertaking similar government work in the British Isles, work which on the one hand ran counter to local vested interests and on the other gave opportunity for the local inhabitants to make money out of government, he would encounter the same sort of difficulties: obstruction and attempts to charge as much as possible for everything. Personally, considering local conditions on the Trucial Coast, I am surprised that the obstructions have not been more serious. Yours sincerely, sd/- T.C.Fowle.I COPY COKPIDEKTIAL .

In continuation of my demi-official letter £lo«869-S, of 18th November, and our conversation of to-day on the subject of the construction of the rest house at Shargah. 2« I am, of course, most anxious to assist you in the construction of the rest house in any way I can, and after discussion on the matter we agreed on the following* As already explained in paragraph 9 of my letter quoted above, I have no political officer whom I can spare to reside permanently at Shargah* I will, however, ask Loch, the new Political Agent, Bahrain, to fjy down by Imperial Airways as soon as possible after taking over from Prior, spend a week at Shargah, and assist Mackay to overcome any local difficulties with which he may be confronted* Thereafter Loch will make periodical visits by air to Shargah for the same purpose. These visits, we agreed, should assist Mackay materially* 3. The chief difficulty on your side - as you explained - is that when Mackay is on the spot in Shargah things go fairly well, but when he leaves Shargah for ’Iraq or elsewhere, in connection with other R.A.P* P.W.D. work, hitches and delays occur* As pointed out in paragraph 7 of my demi-official of 18th November, the best solution, in my opinion, would be for Mackay to stay at Shargah permanently* This, however, you cannot arrange.

CONFIDENTIAL. Uo.C/23b of 1932. Political AgenJ, Bahrain, Dated the 17th December 1932. From The Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon , ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that in accordance with the instructions contained in your letter .No.C-46 dated the 10th December 1932 I visited Shargah by Flying Boat, going there on the 14th December and returning on the loth December. 2. On ray way to Shargah, I passed over H&amp;lul and Sir Bu Na* ir Islands, and on the way back passed over Abu Dhabi and then landed to see the Royal Air Force landing ground and anchorage at Yas Island. From there I passed over Qatar, set In,/Vakrah, A1 Bids* and Doha. Pilot Officer Pearce, who had been to Doha with my predecessor, pointed out the site of the proposed emergency landing ground* 3. On rny arrival, after a short delay owing to the fact that the weather permitted us to land at Shargah instead of Dubai, Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif, the Residency Agent, came off to the Flying Boat and took Group Captain Welsh (who had arrived from Muscat just before me)and myself ashore to his house; where I took an opportunity of handing to him your letter Ho*C~51 dated the 11th December 1932 placing him under my orders. Shaikh Saltan bin Saqar, Ruler of Shargah, visited me at the Residency Agent’s house. After a short exchange of courtesies he led me through part of the Suo to his Fort, for a return visit. I declined the kind invitation of the Residency ...7. • • • • L Residency Agent to lunch with him, as my visit was at short notice and he was doubtless busy preparing for the visit of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in.Chief. round the work and then went by car with the Residency Agent to see Shaikh 2aid bin Maqtum of Dubai* The visit was entirely 5* No business was discussed at any of these meetings* 6. After dinner on the 14th December the Shaikh of Shargah sent word that he would like to come to see me and we had a satisfied generally with all that was being done, but asked that he might be shown the detailed accounts as he was paying out money but did not know in detail for what he was paying* He added that in the past much had been spent which had ’flown into the air’ without result* Unfortunately it was too late to get Natha Singh, but I said that I knew of the arrangements which had been made by you and would ask Natha Singh to let him see the accounts, as Captain Mackay was absent* The next morning when walking round the works, I heard Natha Singh’s side of the question: which was that the accounts were there and that the Shaikh had sent various people from time tot ime to look at them, but that they had no idea of checking such accounts* Incidentally, he said that the Shaikh had already spent some of the money entrusted to him as an ’advance’ against his subsidy* I do not think, however, that there is likely to be any difficulty about the accounts if Captain Mackay (who is at present ill in Basrah) or Flight Lieutenant Finch sees the Shaikh and explain any point which may not be clear to him, as it arisea* 4* After lunch at the Imperial Airways* Station I walked informal, as I had not been able to send word ahead, but I was fortunate enoughto find him and make his acquaintance* conversation with only Humaid present* The Shaikh seemed-3- 7* I have not, of course, seen the work before so have no standard of comparison, but I have talked with, several persons who have watched the growth of the Station from its inception and they say that in the last three weeks the work has been progressing very well* I think that your warning to the Residency Agent and my visit with instructions to him to consider himself under my orders will ensure that he does his best to further the work in future* I have asked Flight Lieutenant Finch to inform me at once by telegram if he experiences any political difficulty and Group Captain Welsh has kindly offered to send me down by Flying Boat in case of necessity* I would only add that I was perfectly friendly in my attitude to Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif and was careful to leave Shargah before the visit of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-'-'hief so that I should not, on my first visit, appear to be trying to displace him in the public eye* 8* Natha Singh told me that his only difficulty at the moment was getting .1 uas (mortar) from Q,i3hm and Dubai quickly enough to keep pace with the work, and I mentioned the matter to the Shaikh of Shargah and also to the Residency Agent and Humaid* 9* I did not have the time to go into the matters detailed in Captain Mackay’s report and in any case ,as the work seems now to be proceeding smoothly and quickly, it would have been inadvisable to start enquiries which would only have led to trouble, and possibly have prejudiced the future progress of the work. From my own experience of construction and other works with Sir William Wilcocks* Mission in Iraq, I should say that the difficulties which have arisen are to a large extent those inseparable from the beginning of such works in a newly opened up area; and in this case there was need for , haste. ♦ • • • #haste, which, as you know, is a fatal thing to demand from the Arab Littoral* Moreover in view of the vested interests, both political and economic, which were at stake, it seems un fortunate that an officer should have been sent to Shargah, who did not know Arabic and who, apparently, had no independent interpreter* I trust, however, that there will be no recurrence of the initial difficulties* 10* I hope t o go down again to Shargah after Ramadhan* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd/- G.

Please see previous submission on P.Z.5585/32 below ana the very interesting report from the European engineer in charge of the work on the liest House at shargah which we have now received from the iiir Ministry. The report speaks for itself. It is to be hopeu, however, that the severe warning administered to the Agent by Colonel Howie last August, consequent on complaints from Captain Lackay to a large extent covered by this report, will have produced the desired effect. The Residency agent, who represents the third generation of his family to occupy that post, inevitably finas himself put in the shade by the residence (even though it is temporary in character) on the Trucial Coast of a European officer, ana that (coupled with the interference with his financial profits) is perhaps to a large extent the explanation of his attitude. But it is well that he shoula be left in no aoubt as to how we should regard obstruction or aouble-aealing on his part. 2 . I submit that I might be authorised to reply to Captain Peirse as in the draft now attached.HP Draft Paper. DriAFT political Department. r: DEC 1932 Conliaential. Group Captain K.E.C. Peirse, My dear Peirse, D.3.0., Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C. 2. We were very much interested in the report from Mackay enclosed in your confiaential letter to me of the 17th November, about the work on the Rest House at dhargah ana the attitude of Isa. No doubt, as you say, Powle will have haa a copy airect, but to make sure we have sent copies to him (ana to the Government of India). * 5015/32 flagged, para.20. As you know, Dickson, in his * report of 4th August last on the Shargah negotiations, of which copies were sent to the Air Ministry under our printed letter P.2.5015/32 of 22nd August, suggested that Isa was inclinea to view our closer connection with the frucial Coast with a rather jaundiced eye, on the ground that the more we were in evidence there, the less important his own position was likely to become. Barrett, in a despatch 5th September 1929, No. 403-3, of which copies were sent at the time to the Air Ministry, had taken much the same points, and no doubt matters have tended rather to come to a head with the location on the 'frucial Coast/r: Coast (even though it is temporary only) of a European officer, a further result of which has been a reduction in the financial profits for which Isa had hoped in connection with the building of the riest House. But as you will have seen from the Resident's despatch No*C.21 of the j 31st August last, of which copies were sent to the Air Ministry under our printed letter No.P.Z.5585/32 of i r 17th September, Howie visited Shargah in .august consequent on complaints from Mackay wnich seem to ^ have been to a large extent those covered by his present report, and administered a severe warning to the Residency Agent. We shall no doubt hear further if the results of that warning have been unsatisfactory and it will then be possible to consider what further steps should be taken. But we hope here that the warning will have been effective. 3. We are sending copies of this letter to the Government of India and to Howie. J. G.

ITZKZV, '^0IN5er . 1* The following statement is based mainly on the diary kept by NATHA SINGH, a Jat Sikh, specially employed by ^orks and Buildings Department as Supervisor on the construction, and from my memory of the various events, my conversations with non- English- speaking natives have always been conducted through Interoreters* These have been NATH^ SINGH, DAVID, my .Assyrian Bearer, and HUSSAIN, who is the Interpreter of K.B.ISSA, the Residency Agent* I have, however, at times used various Indians resident on the Coast. 2. I have endeavoured throughout to record the more important interviews and statements that have been made and to give dates to them* In addition, I have had many conversations with natives of all classes and races, which have undoubtedly influenced my opinions by acting as corroborative evidence of the truth of statements recorded. 5* To understand better various difficulties I experienced in the very early stages, it should be realised that I was the first European, within living memory, to take up a more or less permanent residence on the Trucial Coast, and that the Rest House construction was the first foothold made on the Coast by any European Government for some centuries* I was, therefore, on my arrival, regarded by the oooulation at large with suspicion mingled with fascinated interest. 4. On 10th August, 1972, NATHA SINGH with defence and other stores arrived at SHARJAH by the Slow Mail. A delay of about B hours ensued before the stores were unloaded into Dhows for transhipment to the shore. The cause of the delay as subsequently ascertained from the B.I.S.N.Co’s ^gent at DEBAI, an Indian called METHA, was because ABDUL RAHMAN, cousin of ISSA, wished to use his private Dhows for the work to the exclusion of the Dhows usually hired by the B.I. Agent. 5. On the 11th August, NATHA SINGH accompanied by HUSSAIN called upon SHAIKH SULTAN of SHARJAH. All the Shaikh’s brothers were present and discussion took place anent the Rest House. In reoly to enquiries, HUSSAIN stated that it would be useless to commence serious work until the pearl fleet returned, and that such coolie labour as was available in SHARJAH would cost Rs.l/- oer diem and proportionately higher for tradesmen, a Mason, for instance, would cost Rs.5/- or more per diem. Later in the day, NATHA SINGH inspected the stone which had been collected and found only a small quantity of inferior quality. On the 12th August, the Shaikh and his brothers went to see NATHA SINGH early in the morning and talked about the work to be done. They were asked what arrangements had been made about the supply of materials generally and what quantities the Shaikh’s Head Mason had told him would be required after the former had gone over the plan left with him by the Chief Engineer on his previous visit. The Shaikh replied that he had no Mason, had seen no olan, and had ordered no materials: he had been told by t A that he (IfSA) would arrange everything. While this talk was in progress, I arrived by Flying Boat and proceeded to ISSA’s house where I met-the Shaikh, Natha Singh, Issa and others. I received a short report from Natha Singh and requested the Shaikh and Issato provide labour as soon as possible. I inspected the aerodrome, marked out the Rest House site and inspected the stone. I found that stone was being conveyed to the site by the Ford bus (converted to a lorry), which 1 had been informed by Issa during the Agreement negotiations could not be used on the Rest Iiouse construction, since it belonged to a Syndicate in which Shaikh Sultan was the principal shareholder, and since the Shaikh was really passively oouosed to the construction of the Rest Bouse, he would not allow of its use by me. I, therefore, questioned Tssa and Hussain about this and was told that the Shaikh had disposed of his interest to the rest of the Syndicate, who had been given a contract to carry all stone and stores required in the Rest House construction. Issa further gave me to understand that it was with great difficulty that he had got the Shaikh to sign the contract and so provide the transport which was so essential to the work. 1 left the same day by Flying Boat for RAS-al-KHAIMAH in connection with an estimate for a ^etrol Store and did not return till the evening of the 14th. 6. Meanwhile,on the 15th, Issa sent one Tindal, a relative of his (Rs.?/S/- p.d.) and 4 coolies (Rs.l/- p.d.) to Natha Singh. Uth these, the marking out of the Rest House, Defence p ost, and wire entanglements was begun. Both Issa and the Shaikh when visiting the site were asked by Natha Singh to nrovide more labour. Natha Singh had, by this time, formed the oninion that all was not well, since several Indian merchants, who had visited him, had told him that there was plenty of labour -in the town at Annas 4 to Annas 8 p.d., denending on the nature of the work, and further that Issa could supply labour if he wanted, since the real master of the town was not Shaikh Sultan, but Issa._ 7. Vhen I returned Natha Singh reported to me on the 15th what had hanpened. I decided that there must be some political reason for the apparent inability of Issa to get the Shaikh to orovide labour, so, not wishing to interfere in such a matter, I explained to Issa on the 16th the urgency of the work and requested that labour be obtained forthwith. Hussain explained that t.ie Shaikh was not willing to pay a coolie rate of Rs.l/- p.d. and coolies would not work for less. On the 17th, some 10 or 12 extra men turned up for work. The Tindal informed me that they had been sent by the Shaikh to work at As.12 p.d. After about ? Fours, these men struck, saying they would not work for Rs#1 ' 1 ascertained from one of the coolies that they had been sent by Hussain and not by the Shaikh. On the IRth I realised that something must be done, and that, if issewould not be responsible if the work suffered in consequence, and reiterated that labour would not be satisfactory until after the pearling fleet returned* 1 then asked about the sum of Rs#10,000/- left with Issa to be advanced to the Shaikh on my recommendation# I was told that over Rs#6,000/- had been soent by Issa on the work and none advanced to the Shaikh. I at once requested details and an explanation of why payments hao been made without my knowledge# Issa told me that he had spent the money so as to facilitate the work by buying materials and that he would produce an account# 9# It was now clear to me that - (i) the Shaikh had no control over, or knowledge of, the funds which the Government were entrusting to Issa to advance to him on my recommendation; (ii) Issa had spent sums from these advances without authority; (iii) Issa was forcing up the price of labour. The reason for the latter soon transpired. Indian merchants told Natha Singh and an Arab merchant told me that Issa wished to delay the work until the pearling fleet returned, so that he could send to the works his pearl divers. These men he would, in the ordinary course of events, have to feed throughout the winter; if, however, they were employed on the Rest House, he could draw Rs.l/- p.d. for each of them, which, when he had paid for their food, would leave him with the handsome profit of about Annas 12 per man per day. 10. On the 20th 1 saw the Shaikh and told him that Issa had spent a lot of money on his behalf and asked him what he knew about it. He said he did, as Issa advised him and that he had signed receipts for advances, although he had no idea how the money had been spent. I explained to him the meaning of the Agreement, and he asked me to get the Political Resident to come to Sharjah, so that he could talk with him. He said he wanted to talk to the Political Resident alone and not with Issa present. The same evening about 8 o*clock while I was in my house dressing to go on board Bideford for dinner, Issa paid up all the labour outside his house, and one of his servants informed the men that Issa ordered them not to work in future for the Shaikh or myself. If anyone asked them why,they were to answer that they would not work for less than Rs.l/- p.d# The whole of this scene was witnessed by my bearer who speaks Persian, who, not realising the significance of it, did not tell me till the following day when he heard from me that no men had turned up for work. 11. No men at all turned up on 21st, although many of the men stopped Natha Singh in the Bazaar and elsewhere and told him they would willingly work for Annas 12 p.d., but were afraid of Issa. Together with Natha Singh I went to the Shaikh and asked him if he had authorised the payment. He said that he had given no authority and that he would see me and Issa at the latter's house in an hour's time. I, therefore, went to Issa and asked him why he had made this payment. He stated that the men had come to him and asked to be paid off, since they would not work for Annas 12, and as there was other work at higher rates available, they wanted to be free at once so as to get this better work. (It is a significant fact that, during this day, the majority of the men, who had been working, were sitting Idle In the bazaar.) I then asked him why he did not inform me when4 the men came* Re said he thought I was on hoard the sloop. I asked him what time the men came and he replied M 8 o’clock'*. I pointed out that I had requested him earlier in the day to get a boat to take me to the sloop at 8*30, so that he should have known ^ I was still in my house, or at least have sent s servant the five yards from his house to mine in order to find out. He made no reply. The Shaikh, his brothers, and several others then came in. A general discussion on funds and wages took place. I asked the Shaikh why he could not obtain cheaper labour from his own town. He replied he wished to pay the usual rate of 4s.4 to s.8 p.d., and he did not know why the men did not turn up as there were hundreds of men in the town without work. Issa said he wanted the men paid Rs.l/- p.d., so that they should come willingly to work. I then informed the gathering that the maximum rate I would sanction was Annas 12 p.d., and unless sufficient labour was forthcoming, I would import labour from Bahrein and Basrah. I further pointed out that I considered the labour difficulties to be organized by some persons who were anti-British, and that the Political Resident would no doubt take a serious view of both the Shaikh’s and lesa’s conduct if this trouble was not stopped. I then had to leave the meeting for a short while to see an Officer from the Sloop who was at my house. On my return, Natha Singh informed me quietly that both Issa and Hamit (President of the lorry Syndicate) had been urging the Shaikh not to pay anything lower than Rs.l/- p.d., and that they were telling the Shaikh that, if he did not oppose me, he would soon find all his power in my hands. i then raised the question of the hire of the lorry and asked for details. These were given to me. I said that I considered the price excessive, and then and there worked out a orice which shewed that Rs.l/- per trip was about the cost orice, while the Shaikh was paying between Rs.4/- and Rs.5/-. Issa and Hamid at once had a whispered conversation with the Shaikh, who said he had given his word to the Company and could not break it. The meeting then broke up. Before leaving, I again requested Issa to let me have an account of his expenditure. 12. I had decided by now that the cause of all the trouble was Issa. Not only was he robbing the Shaikh and the British Government, but he was also most actively opposing in every way possible the Rest House construction in as far as it meant my presence in Sharjah. Natha Singh and myself had been told by sever! men of different races and classes that Issa was determined to get us out of Sharjah. '^hen we asked for reasons, we were told that our presence prevented Issa from making the large sums he intended from the Rest House, and that he would no longer be able to make his large income of former years, the source of which was largely fees taken from all litigants, subsidies from Shaikhs, percentage on customs and fees for returning to their owners run away slaves, etc., etc. Of the exact truth of these statements I have no definite proof in writing, but I believe that they are true in substance since they form the only explanation of the obvious lack of support 1 have received from Issa. * I, therefore, confided my troubles to Captain Dennison oi Lideford , who sent for me a signal requesting the Political Resident to visit Sharjah, since I was not satisfied that the money advanced by Government was being expended properly under the existing arrangements. 14. During the next few days nothing much of interest took place. On the 22nd the workmen turned up as usual under one Khawaja, who stated that he had been appointed by the Shaikh and issa to administer the men and pay them. The actual work of building the defence post and wiring the aeroplane enclosure5. proceeded fairly smoothly considering the unskilled nature of the labour provided* The only incident was the visit of Metha, the B*I•Co 1 a Dibai Agent. This man (Indian by birth) has lived about 9 years at Dibai; during that period he has built up a '“n flourishing business as a pearl merchant and has also apparently ingratiated himself into the position of princioal adviser to the Shaikh of Dibai. In the course of a conversation at which both the Shaikh of Sharjah and Iasa were nresent, Metha asked the latter why the aerodrome had not been sited at Dibai since it was obviously the better place and the Shaikh of Dibai was a poor man and would have welcomed a subsidy; was it not because he (Issa) would not agree? Issa replied that it was because the men of Dibai would not let the Shaikh of Dibai sign* Metha laughed and said that he understood that someone had influenced the Shaikh of Dibai. 15. On the 24th August, Issa informed me that he had prepared an account of his expenditure from the Rs.10,000/- entrusted to him. His principal Items were for the purchase of stone, transport, purchase of cement, bullies, date palm mats, and labour. To show the unsatisfactory nature of these payments, the following table should be oonsidered:- than 100,000 cu.ft., and the average number of the stones as supplied by Issa to one cu.foot was about 7, and the average number of coolies will be at least 30 daily for six months, it is obvious that his management of the funds would have cost the Shaikh and Government about Rs.50,000/- at least, if allowed to continue. I, therefore, instructed him that no payment of any kind was to be made by him for the Rest House, unless approved in writing by me. He said the Shaikh needed money to carry on the work and I told him if the Shaikh asked me I would sanction it. 16. On the following day, T received numerous complaints from the men that Khawaja had not paid them their proper wages of Annas 12 the previous day, and that night, while dining with the Shaikh, I told him of this. Issa again said the Shaikh wanted money and I gave him the same reply as before. 17. On the 26th, the Shaikh visited the aerodrome during the evening. He appeared to be very worried and was obviously embarrassed when he talked with me. That night the Shaikh went to Natha Singh's house accompanied by only one guard. He had a long talk with Natha Singh, during the course of which he asked myself. He said it appeared that I was trying to stop Issa wasting the money and, therefore, I must be a good friend of his (the Shaikh's), but that Issa's friends were trying to persuade Article. issa's price Subsequent orice as paid 5Z myself in the open market.

Since the total amount of stone required is not less what were the real intentions of the British Government and ofA 6 . him all day long that my real intentions were to seize the Shaikhdom from him. Natha Singh explained and told everything to him and he said he now realised who were really his friends, but that he was powerless with Issa and so would Natha Singh tell me not to mind what he said if Issa was present. He would like to see me alone and without Issa knowing if it could be arranged. When Natha Singh informed me of this interview early next morning, I at once wrote to the Shaikh and told him that I was sent to Sharjah to help and guide him in the building of the Best House and that, if I could help him in any way, I should be always ready to do so, and that, if he wanted money for the Rest House, he had only to ask me. When he got this letter, which was written, of course, in English, he at once sent it to Natha Singh for translation into Arabic, saying that he would not trust Hussain, Issa*s Interpreter, who usually did any translation for him. From this date onwards, I have always been on the best of terms with the Shaikh, and I believe he trusts Natha Singh and myself more than any people in Sharjah. 1ft. On the Sftth, the Shaikh asked for a general conference on finance. It was held In my house and the following were present. Shaikh, Issa, Natha Singh, HAmld, Hussain, and myself. On the Shaikh asking me what my ideas were, I informed them that I did not want to interfere with actual payments, but that, before 1 would sanction any advance, I must satisfy myself that labour was being properly paid, and at fair rates, and that stores were being purchased at market prices. If I was sure of this, and the Shaikh asked me either personally or by letter, I would always sanction an advance. Beyond such audit control, I left everything to the Shaikh. He said he would appoint Hamid as his Agent to make all payments and told him to let me know anything I wanted so that I could keep an account of the expenditure. I, therefore, authorised Issa to pay to the Shaikh Rs.1,000/- to carry on the work. Later in the day the Shaikh sent me a message through Hamid that if I thought fit the coolie rate should be reduced to Annas B p.d. 19. On the ?9th, since the most urgent work was well in hand, I reduced coolie strength which had gradually crept up until between sixty and seventy men were being employed. Thirteen unemployed men came from Sharjah and asked to be employed at Annas 8 p.d. I took them on at this rate, and that night after pay, informed all the labour that the rate the following day would be Annas ft p.d. 20. On the morning of the 30th, all labour turned up as usual and started work. After about two hours, a cousin of Issa f s and Khawaja came and addressed the men who then struck work. Natha Singh took on some Baluchis at Annas ft p.d., who were travelling through Sharjah, and men gradually trickled back so that by noon over twenty men were at work. I was away most of this day as the Bideford arrived with the Political Resident on board. His visit is described in his despatch No.C-21 of 1932. .dated 31st Aug ust, 1932 . On the ^ist more labour than was * -j* needed turned up for work. Sufficient were engaged at Annas ft p.d., and later quite a number were taken on at Annas 6 p.d. at the men s urgent request to be given work of any kind at any price. On 2nd September, at the Shaikh*s request, labour was reduced to Annas 6 p.d. There was no trouble of any sort, nor has any further incident occurred in the labour market. 21. For the next few days, all was quiet. p ayments were made by Hamid and accounts kept by me. I had several private talks with the Shaikh at his request both at his house and atT 7. fVi Natha Singh’s. He would not coma to my house, as he said Issa would overhear ell that was said* He told me many things about Sharjah and the Coast generally, and asked my advice on numerous questions ranging from the health of his wives to the cost of dredging the Sharjah Khor. It was during one of these talks that he told me that his brother Shaikh Mohammed had differed with him over the expenditure on the Rest House and had said that Issa was wasting the money* Mohammed, therefore, left the town and went into the interior* I told him it was a pity for them to differ, as the expenditure was now under the Shaikh’s control. A few days later. Shaikh Mohammed returned and the brothers appeared to be the best of friends* ^ r e also discussed Rest House finance and the Shaikh authorised me to cut down expenditure wherever I could, especially on stones and the lorry. He told me that after the agreement was signed, Issa said the lorry must be hired for the work, and that the lorry syndicate, in order to help the Shaikh, would hire it to him at the very cheap price of Rs.25 per 1,000 stones. Since Issa owned a car, the Shaikh thought he must know what was a fair price and so signed the contract. 22* Issa meanwhile was very subdued. He came to me one night and expressed penitence for the past* I said I had no animosity against him, but in the words of the Political Resident would judge by results* 23. Since the labour question appeared to be satisfactorily settled, 1 now spent most of my time investigating the stores question. The first Item I took was Cement. issa had shewn in his accounts an expenditure of Rs.l,ROO/- for 600 bags of cement. When I asked why he had made such a purchase, he told me that the late Political Resident and the Chief Engineer had approved the purchase during their visit to Sharjah. I asked to see the cement, but was given varying excuses for several days. At last, it was produced and Proved to be unbranded and of very inferior quality. Since it was useless for my requirements, I requested Indian merchants in Dibai to obtain me quotations from India for decent cement. 24. I next took up the question of stones. Measurements of the stone delivered and the amounts stated by Hamid to have been paid by him shewed a rate of about Rs.40/- per 100 cu.ft. Conversations with dhow owners, who complained to me that Hamid was not paying them, and measurement of their boats, shewed that the rate he paid, when he did pay, was about Rs.12/- per 100 cu. ft. I, therefore, went to Dibai and saw Metha and asked him whether Dibai people would like to enter into a stone contract. He said they would, and after a few days, gave me a tender for 100,000 cu. ft. at Rs.il/- per 100 cu.ft. Further the stones were to be larger than those supplied by Hamid, which were often too small to be of use; I may add here that I found out from dhowmen that Hamid had instructed them to bring only small stones and, if necessary, to break up large ones on the Islands to provide the supply, the reason, of course, being that four small stones give four times the profit to the lorry syndicate that one large one does. I told the Shaikh what I had done and he asked various men in Sharjah for similar tenders. Since the lowest price was Rs.15/- per 100 cu.ft., he accented Metha’s tender. Metha gave a security deoosit of Rs.500/- for the fulfilment of his contract. The contract is working very smoothly except for two incidents which will be mentioned later, and the quality and size of stone supplied are most satisfactory*(%) 25. Having settled stones, I next attacked what I have always regarded as the strong card of the Issa party, namely the lorry. Without it, I could not convey stores to the site and work would cease. The lorry syndicate knew this and relied on their monopoly to deter me from attempting to reduce their rates. It was, in fact, a pistol held at my head. I, therefore, discussed the matter with the Shaikh. He agreed that the rate must be reduced and stated that he wanted a lorry of his own, so that his oayments for transport should not involve payment of a profit to other men. He also authorised me to hire camels and donkeys, as I thought fit. to carry stores, if the lorry syndicate would not reduce their orices and stopped work. ; I, therefore, decided to utilise Issa. I saw him and Hussain and carefully explained why I considered the lorry rates excessive. I further explained that the Shaikh was prepared to provide other transport. Issa agreed that the rates were too high (he knew this before since he is a sharer in the lorry profits) and said he would persuade the lorry syndicate to accent my proposed new rate of Rs.13/6 oer 1,000. At a meeting, therefore, of the fhaikh, Issa, Hussain, Hamid (representing the syndicate), Natha Singh and myself, I offered the syndicate the new terms and said, if they did not see their w^y to accept, other means of transport would be found. After considerable discussion between Issa and Hamid, the latter accented the new terms and signed a new contract. The next day I left by air for Baghdad. ^ the surface fairly smooth, hut I soon discovered that, during my absence, every endeavour had been made by Issa and his followers to turn the Shaikh/against me and hinder the work. The I'haikh has told me that Issa’s men are continually pressing him to refuse to pay out any further money under my direction on the Rest House construction, telling him that I am robbing him in favour of the British Government. They also told him tnat I had built a petrol store at the aerodrome for the A.P.O.C., so that the Company need not keep their stocks in Sharjah and so avoid rent, thereby cheating Sharjah people out of th-^ir rights; that^ I had erected the wind indicator as a 26. On my return some ten days later, I found things on flag to show that the Rest House was British and not the -haikh s; that I was insisting that the guards at the a ing to custom.

He has been laid up for the last few days with a bad toe. He reported that everything was peaceful on shore and work on xtest house was proceeding satisfactorily. 15. Captain ivackay had been at Ras-al-KHaimah investigating possibility of erecting a petrol store there in place of existing dhow. He returned to Debai by flying boat and reached oharjah by car about 2000 . He came off to see me that evening and informed me of the state of affairs ashore, as far ashe was concerned. He said everything was working smoothly. The ground had been marked out and a considerable amount of material was already out on the sanding Ground. The barbed wire was going out there tomorrow, and a start would be made then to erect it. He had ten coolies working and another twenty coolies were starting tomorrow. He has already fifteen armed guards (out of thirty five eventually arranged for). He has authorised Isa to pay for these guards out ql the money he has for advancing to the 3 heikh. The bail 3tearner has already called once at Gharjah anu landed a lot of stores and the next one is expected next Wednesday or Thursday. Captain iwackay hopes that the two motor lorries will be on board this steamer. In short, Captain mackay is pleased with the progress made and is not, at the moment, in need of anything.16 IBP 16. The situation regarding question of the erection of a Petrol Store at Has-al-Khaiinah appears to be as follows:- The Sheikh of lias-al-Khaiinah has always been an obstructionist regarding stowage of Petrol ana has always put every obstacle in the way of berthing and maintenance of barge, etc. Barge is now useless owing to her leaky condition and petrol is stowed in a Jhow - an unsatisfactory state of affairs. Captain Hackay was instructed to go to Ras-al-Zhaimah to prepare an estimate for building a Petrol Store ashore. His estimate is £170; to be built from local materials. He reported that the Sheikh is now all for keeping the petrol at Ras-al-Khaimah, realising that, now Sharjah has been chosen as the Air Port, the retention by him of the R.A.P. Petrol Store is the only thing left by which he can squeeze any money out of the Grovernmen t. negotiate with the Sheikh of Ras-al-Xhaimah on these matters®I I p^. 905 / 1955 .

At 1808 I received following signal from s.s. 'BANDRA” from Debai ... 'Sheikh Debai refuses boats and coolies for Sharjah. Arriving 7 p.m. tonight. Can you arrange.' I sent an officer aahore to bring Isa off. The latter was out at the Aerodrome and it was not till 2000 that he arrived on board. He (Isa) stated that they had been expecting the Mail Steamer since daylight and that the Sehikh of Sharjah had had ample dhows and coolies ready all day. As Mail Steamer had not arrived by sunset he had withdrawn his dhows into the creek and sent away the coolies. It was low water at 2200 and there was a strong north westerly wind blowing. S.S. ’'BANDRA” arrived at 2C15 and anchored about 1 -J- miles from the shore. I boarded her on arrival. it was the Captain’s first visit to Sharjah. He told me his orders were to call at Debai and Sharjah. He arrived at Debai at 1600 and discharged what little cargo he had for Debai in a very short time. The 3.1. Agent told him that as Sharjah had no dhows and no coolies it was the custom for the Mail Steamer to discharge any cargo she might have for Sharjah into Debai dhows and to two them full of Debai coolies to Sharjah. No. 50 / 613 . Sir, The Residency Agent informed me that there was no truth whatever in this assertion and that Sharjah had plenty of dhows and coolies. The B.I. Agent further informed the Captain of the 'Bundra'’ that the Sheikh of Debai had now refused to allow any of his dhows or coolies to proceed to Sharjah to unload any Imperial Airways stores, hence his (the Captain’s) signal to me. S.S. 'Bandra' had on board Mr. White (Camp Supervisor of Imperial Airways at Shaibah) one Iraqi w/T operator, rifles and amnunition for Guards, Tentage and various other Imperial Airways stores. On my return to ny ship I sent Isa ashore to instruct the Sheikh that lighters and coolies must be sent off at once as the Mail steamer was already 24 hours late. This incident shows clearly, I think, the sort of attitude we may expect in the future from the Sheikh of Debai towards anything to do with the Aerodrome at Sharjah despite the clear warning given to him by the Political * Resident on 1st September. 3* Dhows and coolies were sent off at daylight and Mr. hits, the operator, and all stores were safely landed s.s.

The Residency Agent requested me to bring to the notice of the authorities conoerned that it would be a great convenience to the Sheikh of Sharjah if a V/T Signal could be made a few hours before arrival of Mail Steamer, giving probable time of arrival, so that dhows and coolies should be ready.

He informed me that Hussain had left for Bandar Abbas five days ago. His family is still at Basidu and he has not disposed of his property. The Custodian further informed me that a new Persian Collector of Customs arrived about six weeks ago who refuses to allow any comodities (such as tea, coffee, sugar, flour, rice, etc ) to enter British Basidu.

The expenditure involved will be debitable to the Air Ministry. The procedure suggested by Colonel Fowle in his present aespatch seems convenient. If, however, experience shows that it works unsatisfactorily it can be modified. 2/2* The main interest, apart from this relatively minor point, of the Resident's present aespatch is the question of the attitude of the Residency Agent. Colonel Dickson, in reporting in detail on his negotiations at Shargah in July, indicated that he was not altogether satisfied with the attitude of Isa, who, as will he remembered, represents the third generation of Residency Agents on the Trucial Coast, and who is the head of a family which, as the result of its connection with H.M.G. has greatly grown in power, wealth ana general status in that region. Colonel Dickson (rather following in this suggestions made in 1928 by Colonel Barrett)was inclined to suggest that the Agent viewed our closer connection with the Trucial Coast with a slightly jaundiced eye on the ground that the more we were in evidence ther the less important his own position was likely to become. There is no doubt a good aeal in this, but it is to be hoped that the warning which has now been given the Agent by Colonel Fowle will operate to prevent any difficulty in the future.

Sir, 1 have the honour to state that on the 22 nd August 1932 I received a telegram from the Air Officer Commanding in •Irag, a copy of which i enclose. In view of the urgency of the work in question, the erect- -ion of the Best house, and of the importance of avoid- -mg local friction at Shargah, I decided to visit that place. I left Bushire hy the mail of the 28th Augest, transhipped to H.B.S.'Bideford*, which the Senior Saval Officer,Persian Gulf Division, had kindly placed at my disposal, off Tamh Island on the evening of the 29th and reached Shargah early on the morning of the 30th. Oaptain Denison, who had visited Shargah _ ._ Colonel recently- it was on the 'Bideford' that/Dickson had finally negotiated the agreement with the Shaikh for a landing ground etc. - was able to give some useful information at&gt;out Shargah personalities. 2 . On arrival I saw Captain Mackay, who gave me in further detail# what is already contained in the tele-telegram quoted adove. Briefly tie was of opinion that Shan Bahadur Isa Bin fcxfcx Ahdul Latif, the •^sidency Agent, who had on Behalf of the Shaikh, the payment of funds for the construction of the Best House in his hands, was not laying out these funds to the Best advantage, and was further~for his own' ends- Being oBstructive rather than helpful in mat- -ters such as providing coolies for labour etc. 3* I interviewed the Residency Agent and informed him of Captain ^ackays complaints. I said I had no time to investigate them in detail , But it seemed quite evident that he' was not pulling his weight*. I further informed him that I would for the future -struction of the Best House was proceeding smoothly- well and good. If on the other hand oBstructions and delays continued I should Be compelled to assume that either he- Khan Bahadur isa - was Being oBstructive or that his influence was insufficient to Be of use to us. ^either assumption would Be for his welfare. 4. The Shaikh and 1 enchanged the usual official calls, and this morning had a private interview which lasted some hours. In addition Captain teackay and I discussed the whole question of the control of the construction funds, and finally with the Shaikh came to the following arrangement. A sum of Bs.10,000/-, the first advance of the construction funds, had Been given to the Residency Agent, to pay out on Behalf of the Shaikh. Jb'or the expenditure of this the B e si- -dency Agent has accounts. These he will submit to the bhaikh for checking, and hand over to him whatever judge By results that the con- BalanceHi 3- a /-V balance in cash remains. The Shaikh will then pass of the a receipt for the whole/amount* 5. A further sum of Rs.5,000/- has 'been advanced hy me to the Shaikh today. This will he kept hy the Shaikh. Captain Mackay with one Kumaid, who will he the Shaikh*s representative and general assistant to Captain Mackay, will draw on the Shaikh as required. No money will he paid hy the Shaikh to anybody else. Captain Mackay and Humaid will draw up weekly accounts of their expenditure, show these to the Shaikh and check the balance left in the chest. This will ensure that the Shaikh does not spend the funds in his possess- •sion for other purposes. It is obviously undesirable for Captain Mackay to keep large sums of money in his own house. 6 . I also paid today to the Shaikh -hs. 1,000/-, being his personal subsidy for July and August. In future this subsidy, and the money for payment of the guards, being in the nature of political payments, will be made by me through the -Residency Agent to the Shaikh, who will give him receipts therefor. 7. Captain Mackay,from his point of view, is satis- -fied with the above arrangements and is of opinion that they should lead to the work of construction pro- -ceeding smoothly and rapidly. Captain Mackay has a difficult task to carry out, which it seems to me he is doing efficiently and tactfully. He appears to be well liked by the Shaikh and other notabilities. I am...I am sending copies of this despatch to H.M*s Secretary of State for India, the Air Officer Commanding in-•Iraq, and the Senior 'aval Officer, Persian Gulf Division. I have the honour to he, Sir, ITour most obedient servant, T.C.W.FOWLE „ Lieut-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.r~ \ » / . Telegram To (ffrom Air Officer Commanding, Baghdad Political Resident, Bushire. Unnumbered* Dated and received 22nd August 19S2 Following from ‘'Bideford', beginss- Mackay has had certain amount of trouble with his coolies and organisation paying them. He and most Shaikh are/anxious that Political Besident should visit Shargah as soon as possible. After careful investi- -gation of the facts I consider that visit here of Political Resident would be of very great value at the present time. Mackay is not satisfied that advances by British Agent for construction are being used to best advantage for furtherance of the work and he would like entire control of funds, both for construction and for personal use of Shaikh, to be placed in his hands so that graft may be reduced from its present proportions, ends 2. It seems essential to have position absolutely regularised so that work can be pressed on smoothly. Air Ministry have not yet issued instruc- -tions as to the channel through which subsidy and advances should be made but I suggest that it is de- -sirable that all advances should be regulated by you. Officer Commanding 203 Squadron is being instructed to co-operate with you if you require air passage to Shargah. AVIATION.Draft Paper. •?£. *7 ^ I fr/la* fctir Ui. f political Department.

Croning, iSSlBAccountant-General, You will remember that we had some discussion at the end of June as to the arrangements to be made in connection with the financing of the erection of a rest house to be put up at Shargah on the i'ruclal Coast of the Persian Gulf for use on the tf flX &amp; tU ftjULAj Arati Air xioutef. The arrangement is that the rest house is to he put up at the expense of the Sheikh of anargah, who will receive rent from His Majesty*s Government in respect of it* But as the Sheikh is not in a position to linance its erection himself it is proposed that the Air Ministry should advance the necessary xunas, recouping themselves from the Sheikh oy withholding rent until the total advance has heen repaid. The late Political Resident suggested tis.$0,000 as a prohahle figure. 2. After discussion with you the Air Ministry were informed as follows, in Political Department letter of 4th July, No. P.Z.3888/32:- ' 4/i ■ *-j '4. Hie expenditure involved in connection with the building of the rest house and the making of payments under the agreement with the Sheikh of Shargah will fall on Imperial revenues. The actual payments can only satisfactorily he made hy or under the orders of the Political Kesident. The Secretary of State thinks it important as far as possible to simplify the procedure involved and he suggests, subject to the comments of the Air Ctpuncil and the Government of India, that the siii.plest course will be that the necessary xunus shall from time to time be placed by the Air Council to the credit of the Secretary of state in Council for India in London. On receipt 91 those funds the Secretary of State will instruct the Government of India to make a corresponding advance to the Political Resident, me Political Resident would be responsible for accounting for the advance in question direct to the iiir Ministry, his accounts being transmitted through the India office, which would not, however scrutinise them. Correspondence between the Air ’ Ministry and the Resident regarding accounts ml aht be transmitted through the India thp 1 G fr. U p aer seal. I am to enquire whether ohe Air council concur in the procedure proposed cind to add that in view of the urgency the Secretary of state is prepared, pending exammation of it, to instruct the Government of imice a first advance of ^ 10,000 to the Resident on behalf of the Air Ministry.' 3. On the strength of demi-official intimation from the Air Ministry the Government of India were requested in the Secretary of State’s telegram No.1807 of 5th July to 'authorise immediate advance on behalf of/of His Majesty*s Government of Rs.10,000 to the Hesihent to he recovered from them. I will telegraph further regarding procedure in connection with subsequent payments for rest house under agreement which is under consideration here.' The necessary payment to the Gheikh ms subsequently made by the Resident. 4 * I now attach a copy of a letter from the Air Ministry from which it will be seen that they concur in the procedure proposed in our letter of 4th July. I also enclose an extract from a private letter dated 8th July from the late Political xtesident. It is proposed to inform the Government of India and the Rft s i n fin ^ a r ^he procedure referred to above is now forimlly accented. * *1 c ~ r W 1 vUU o^. i^rrsMMm ipBrca +&gt; U U . 5. Your Department will no doubt take early steps to secure an advance from tne Air Ministry both to/to cover the payment of iss.10,000 which has already been made and to cover such further advances as may be necessary in the near future. It is quite probable that the whole amount of, say, Rs.40,000 ave to be paid out by October or November, since the air route is expected to start functioning on the 1st October and endeavours are being made to complete the rest house as early as possible after that date. a^A. 7^7 fc.yvK .
