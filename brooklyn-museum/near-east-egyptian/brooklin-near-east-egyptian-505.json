The front of the stela is surmounted by the customary winged sun disk below which are two  short columns of hieroglyphs dedicating the stela to King Neb-hpt-R' (Menthuhotep III) founder of the Middle Kingdom. At the base is one row of hieroglyphs stating that he piece was set up by the Priest of Amon, An. The major portion of the surface is occupied by the standing figure of King Neb-hpt-R' making offerings to a large image of the goddess Hathor in the form of a cow standing on a large oblong plinth.\r\nCondition: The piece has suffered considerably; the sun disk etc., are almost totally obliterated and the head and upper part of the king's body are likewise almost totally missing. The edges are very badly broken; a small patch under the cow seems to be an ancient repair filling in a natural defect in the stone. There are some traces of blue pigment in the hieroglyphs and very slight traces of red on the king's body and on the feathers of the sun disk.", "medium": "Limestone, pigment", "dimensions": "7 11/16 x 5 7/8 x 1 7/8 in.
