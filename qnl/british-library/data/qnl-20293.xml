COr Y SENT TO—I 2Z In the course of a long conversation with me yesterday evening Kurl Pasha adverted to this question. He said that he thought that the Irfiqi point of view had never 'been properly represented to ue. The Iraqi Government did not in the least wish to oblige the Sheikh of Koweit to taice any particular aeastires* though they greatly resented the support which they were convinced that he was secretly giving to the saniggling organisations. Ail that they wanted was to have a free hand to deal with the sauggling in their own way. Kecently an Incident had occurred where some aauggiers had been killed and the Iraqis had l&gt;een accused of violating Aoweiti territory. This was not the caae 9 and the Iraqi 3overnaeut had offered to send a British official dorm to verify the fscts, 'but the proposal had not oeen accepted. 2» I told Kuri Pasha that I could not accept his statement regarding the Sheikh of Koweit's interest in the amoggling. Our information was that the sauggling was ooatly organised hy an Iraqi organisation in Basra. The iraqi Oovemaent were of course perfectly free to take any measures they liked on their own territory to deal with the smuggling, but they had been represented to us as wishing to go very mich further r and Nuri himself had implied that Koweit had been behaving very badly. This seemed to show s ml sapp rehension df the legal position. The problem was constantly arising of smuggling into a State with high tariffs through a neighbouring state with low tariffs. In suchfflL—S 3 auch cases there was absolutely no legal obligation under international law for the state with the low tariff to take any measures to prerent smuggling* The same situation had arisen during the prohibition regime in the United States when British territory had been used as a base for liquof anmggling. His Majesty's Government had then been under no legal obligation to take special measures merely to enable the United Statea to enforce their own internal legislation* 3* But while this might be the legal poaition» it was oleerly desirable to arriwe at some arrangementt and f just as His Majesty's Government had come to an agreement with the United States Government with a view to securing a reasonable measure of co-operation in preventing liquor smugglingi ao we had been trying to devise some system by which Koweit mighn co-operate to a reasonable extent with Iraq with a view to preventing the smuggling trade. 4« The difficulty was that the only absolutely effective method of doing this would be to raise the Koweiti tariffs (Kuri immediately agreed on this point)# But this was impracticable - firstly because the Koweiti tariffs were limited by treaty # and secondly because the only effect would be an immense rise of prices in Koweit» and the Koweiti administration could hardly be expected to face the unpopularity and odium which this would involve merely in or^er to enable a neighbouring country to carry out its own tariff legislation* I felt # however# fairly hopeful that the local conference now about to open to discuss this question might find some solution* We had ourselves suggested various methods» such as a system of manifests^ trade control posts» the appointment of a British Director of Customs at Koweitf etc*# and I felt that there was thereforeth«p«for« a reasonable hop« of « setlefactopy settlement being reached* 6* Hurl Pasha said thatf If so 9 this would be most satisfactory* All that Iraq had really wanted hitherto was a free hand to deal with the smuggling In their own way. But if the smuggling could be eliminated by agreement &gt; so much the better* Hitherto It had been most difficult to deal with the question in view of the support which the Sheikh had apparently been receiving from His Majesty^ Govern ?aent* 6* I tried to disabuse Hurl Pasha of the idea that we were taking sides in the dispute» and I repeated my statement of the legal position as described above; but we agreed that no further action was called for until the results of the impending conference were known.

The Residency, Bushire, the 16th July, 1936• &lt;1 Just a line to say that I was very interested to read your Note dated the 12th June of your conversation with Nuri Pasha, which I received via the India Office. I think - if I may say so - that, without taking sides, you put forward the Kuwait aspect of the problem most cogently. The whole question seems to me to be one of those difficult ones where there is right on both sides. It is quite reasonable for Iraq to try and get Kuwait to co-operate in anti-smuggling measures and thus save the Iraq Government the trouble and expense of a Customs Blockade. On the other hand it is equally reasonable for the Shaikh to refuse co-operation if among otner reasons such co-operation - in his opinion r would ruin the trade of his State, and bring the odium of his own people on his head. In other words if his throat is going to be cut he prefers Iraq to do it rather than to commit suicide. At least this was his firm attitude out here. Whether the air of Whitehall has changed his viewi^I do^t know 1 As you doubtless know I am making a dash for liberty at the end of this month and look forward to our meeting. jl.

Shaikh emphasised that res- -ponsibility for preventing smuggling across frontier lay with Iraq Government and that it was unfair to ex- •pect him to assume responsibility of preventive action which was properly their business# He repeated his offers of a system of manifests for goods passing by - sea and was eventually persuaded to agree to the adopt- -ion of a similar system of manifests for goods exported a; from Kuwait to Iraq by land on the understanding that Iraq should set up three or four posts on frontier through which trade with Iraq would be canalised. All goods leaving Kuwait consigned to or through Iraq would caxry manifests which would be issued on the responsibility of the Shaikh# He was emphatic that he could ensure that no goods could leave Kuwait town without his knowledge. It would be up to the Iraqis to deal with as severely as they pleased with persons found crossing Iraqi frontier either Tel e gram From To Repeated toz. either without manifests or at points other than proposed posts* Shaikh refused however to consider the appointment of British Customs Director 'but stated that his present staff worked under his direct con- -trol and were, in his view, of sufficient standing and capacity to deal with issue of manifests etc# 3* His Majesty^s Government regard this course as substantial advance* They have always considered responsibility for watching land frontier must fall primarily on iraq. System of manifests now proposed should do much to ease situation^ Fact that Shaikh has adopted more reasonable attitude will moreover make it difficult to justify extreme measures against him by Iraq. 4* Please therefore, unless you see strong- -est objection, approach Iraq Government iwho 1 under stand are already taking steps to establish effective customs cordon) and endeavour to secure their acceptance of arrangement on general lines now suggested, details of which would be worked out later* 5* While His Majesty^s Government would have been glad if Shaikh had been prepared to accept customs director they are disposed to give new system a trial and see how it works.

In the oourse of a final Interview with ^uri paaha this iBorning, I raised amon^ other subjects the question of ilowelt-iraq smuggling• fc. I reminded mrl Pasha of what I had said during our last interriew on this subject. (£ SuttO), hut explained that we had unfortunately not been able to persuade the SheiiLh of Koweit to a^ree to any friendly arrangement for co-operation for cneciclng smuggling on the lines which had been contemplated 3. On the other hand, the sheiich of Koweit had now announced his intention of coming to England for the saice of his health and was expected to arrive very shortly - probably about July dth. It had been arranged that the whole question should be discussed with him on his arrival and that he should be very strongly advised to reconsider the question of reaching some agreement with Iraq on this matter. I therefore hoped that the Iraqi Government would not take any action of too drastic a character at any rate until we had had a chance of discussing matters further with the Shetkiu Meanwhile, however, the Iraqi Oovernraent were of course perfectly free, as they always had been, to taite any legitimate measures on their own territory against smuggling from xowelt, e.g* by the establishment of a chain of frontier posts, etc* 4. Nurl Pasha said that if it were only a question of a /compa ra 11velyconparativoly eliort delay he saw no object Ion to deferring drastic action until His fctejesty's aovernment should have had an opportunity of speaking to the shelJch* as regards the action to prevent smu^glin^, the trouble was that the British autoorities in the Gulf brought unfounded aoousatlons against the Iraqi Gorernmont of rlolatlng icofweiti territory^ ehen they had not in fact done so. Xn the case of one incident, for instance, the Iraqis had offered that the British judge at J^asra should go to the spot to decide whether they had or had not violated Koweiti territory, but the matter had not oeen pursued, tturi J^asha was satisfied that no violation of icoweiti territory had occurred. I said that I could not discuss this point as I had not got the facts before me. I was not referring to disputed cases of this xlnd, but to ordinary anti^smuggling measures on undisputed Iraqi territory. To these of course there could be no possible objection. 5. The matter was not further pursued, but X got the impression that the Iraqis certainly mean to taite very severe measures against the Sheikh if ho does not do something to help to discourage the Xoweiti smoggllng trade, but that they are prepared to wait a month or so on the chance of our being able to bring the Sheikh to reason meanwhile.

A nice'ting was liold at the^ India Onico on 15oil July to discuss the question of Koweit-Iraq smuggling with His Excellenoy the Sheikh cf Koweit. In addition to the Sheikh and his interpreter there were present: Sir Leonard Wakely, K-O.I.E., O.B., in the Chair. Mr, J.G. Walton, C.B., M.C. Mr. J.G. Laithwaite, C.I.B., Ivlr. M.J.

(1) SIR LEONAED WAKEI^ l expressed to His Excellency the pleasure of those present at having an opportunity of meeting him. After some preliminary discussion, in the couise of which the Sheikh intimated that he had certain other questions to raise besides the question of the smuggling, the Sheikh asked what exactly it was the Iraq Government required of Koweit in the matter ox smuggling. MR. HBiGm explained that the Iraq Government were determined to stop the smuggling no matter what methods they had to employ and had threatened to take severe measures against Koweit if no other solution were possible. H.M.G., on the other hand, were anxious to help Koweit to reach an amicable settlement. H.M.G. had had long experience in ^ -- - dealing with similar questions, and he instanced the case of illegal smuggling into the U.S.A. as a case where one country (H.M.G:) had agreed to help another country {the U.S.A.) to stop smuggling by instituting a system of manifests and byfS- 2. allowing British vessels to be searched lor contraband outside American territorial waters, although H.M.G,jlike Koweit, had been under no legal obligation to do so. The friendly attitude adopted by H.M.G. had been much appreciated by the U.S.Government and had had a generally beneficial effect on the relations between them and H.M.G. 1 ivhat H.M.G, suggested was that His Excellency ^ should follow their example in this case, and take an equally broad and farsighted point of view, and that he should in his own interests cooperate with Iraq rather than rush into a quarrel which might have much more serious consequences than were apparent at present. They did not suggest that the Sheikh should give up any of his rights or independence, but that he should take certain steps voluntarily. He quite realised that any measures taken by His Excellency to check smuggling would involve financial losses to his people, but it was better to cooperate with Iraq in suppressing smuggling and thus preserve legitimate trade rather than be subjected to an Iraqi blockade which would put an end to all trade of any kind. MK. LAITHTAITS said that it Y /as understood that the Sheikh had intimated to Colonel Dickson, at his last interview before leaving Koweit, that he had certain counter proposals to make on this subject and H.M.G. would be interested to know what these were. THE SHBIKH OF K0.1/SIT sa id that there was really no analogy I between the position of Koweit and the question of illegal smuggling into the U.S.A. mentioned by Mr. Rendel. Koweit had no cultivation nor industry, nor anything else to provide a living for her people except the trade which she was at present able to carry on. King Abdul Asiz had stopped smuggling across his borders himself and Persia had also taken certain measures, and so could the Iraq Government if they wanted to do so. It was impossible for His Sxoellejicy himself to do it for them, and he did not see why he should accept a responsibility which v/as really theirs.i5 3. LIR. BEKDEL said that Iraq could certainly prevent the smuggling, but that if the Iraq. Government did this in their own 'way and 'uook similar measures to bnose bauen d^/ i^ing Abdul Aziz, it v/ould be very serious for Koweit. said that he was quite prepared to accept what the Saudis nad done. He was also prepared to help the Iraq Government against smuggling by sea by instituting a manifest system, but by land the Iraq Government must take their own measures. LAITHVAITS said that His S/:cellency 1 s offer to institute a system of manifests by sea was much appreciated. The Iraq Government had however emphasised that their real difficulties v/ere by land. lie asked whether His jixcellency might not be prepared also to institute a maniiest system by land as well as by sea, on the assumption that the iraq Government on their side would establish, say, four Iraqi Customs posts on the frontier through which trade could be canalised. He emphasised that the India Office were most anxious to safeguard Koweit in this matter. TKS SII3IKH pointed out that the difficulty on land was that Koweit supplied goods to several countries and that there were several routes leading from Koweit. If a man wished to take goods to Iraq ho might say that he was going not to Iraq but, for example, to Syria, and it was quite impossible to say whether he was telling the truth or not.MR, LAITHWAITE said that a person leaving Koweit by land would have to pass either through Saudi Arabia or Iraq. Saudi Arabia was not at the moment in question. Under the manifest system suggested a person would be required, if he went to Iraq, to cross the frontier at one of the four Customs posts, to have with him a manifest for any dutiable goods which he carried and to pav the appropriate duty to Iraq whether his ultimate destination was Syria or not. The Sheik's responsibility would have been discharged by the issue of the manilest. THE SHEIKH said that in that case he was quite willing to give manifests to all those who passed out of Koweit en route to Iraq. The m anifest would stat e tne quantities of the goods carried, but would not mention the route to be travelled, or the point at which the frontier would be crossed, since the Koweit authorities could not be responsible for the actual route that tne man might take. His Excellency agreed, however, with a suggestion by Mr.Ward that the manifest might also state that it was given 'for Iraq', but he said he knew that no one going to Iraq would ever tell the truth as to his destination, or take out a manifest, since little or no profit could be made if customs duty had to oe paid at the Iraq frontier. His Excellency agreed, however that if any man were caught by the Iraq authorities carrying goods without a manifest t the man himself would be held responsible and would have to take the consequenc es. MR. LAITHWAITE said that an arrangement such as that suggested by the Sheikh would be of great value, and that his/5. his offer of it was much appreciated 'by H.IvI.G. MR. RSNDEL agreed. He added that the details of the system would require working out and that it would have to be put to the Iraq Government. The idea was that there should be, as it were, gates in the Iraq frontier, for the passage of legitimate trade, and that any merchandise not going through these gates would be stopped by the Iraq authorities. It would be better to have a wall with gates than a wall without any opening at all. MH. LAI TH¥A1TS enquired whether His Excellency had any organised customs service at present which would be capable of issuing manifests. A responsible official would be necessary to issue manifests not only for Iraq but also for Saudi Arabia (if a solution of the question of the Saudi blockade were reached on the basis suggested by the Sheikh of Customs posts and manifests) and also, once the Kuwait Oil Company commenced operations, to deal with imports bj? it. His Excellency said that he already had at ICoweit two special Customs officials, one for trade by sea and one for trade by land who worked under his direct control, and were persons of sufficient authority and standing to issue such manifests. MR. V/'ALT ON reverted to the question of the counter proposal which the Sheikh was said to have mentioned to Colonel Dickson at Koweit. H.M.G. had understood from the latter's report that His Excellency in discussion of the matter in London might be able to make some counter offer as an alternative to the Iraqi intention to impose a blockade. His Excellency had now accepted Mr.Laithwait e's su^ustion in r^oarc. to manifests but had ho not some further/6 • iCurthur pro jooc-1 ol ins ov/n 'to mo.lvG? TIE SIIEIKH said that he had no further suggestions to make, but that he was prepared to accept the manifest system if the Iraq Government wanted it. Colonel Lick son and Colonel Powle had referred to the appointment of a British Customs Director by for which he saw no necessity. MR. IAITIIWAITE suggested that if Koweit had a British Customs Director it would be easier to work with the Iraq Government, who had British Customs experts themselves, and easier to convince the Iraqis that Koweit was really prepared to cooperate than if the Sheikh only had Customs officials With purely local experience. He emphasised that the Director would be the Sheikh's servant, appointed not by H.M.G. but by His Excellency himself. H.M.G. in making this suggestion had been solely concerned with Koweit interests. MR. RENDEL added that the British Customs officials in Iraq had been able to help Iraq trade a great deal. Several independent States, for example Siam, employed British officials and it would be no reflection on the Sheikh's independence if he did so. THE SHEIKH said that Koweit, which derived its Customs revenue from the trade at one port only, could not afford to pay for such a Customs Director, but MR.LAITHWAITE reminded His Excellency that Iraq had offered to pay the cost. His Excellency expressed his dislike of having at Koweit an official paid by the Iraq Government, but MR. LA1THWAITE said that though Iraq might provide the money, there would be no question but that the Director would be in His Excellency's own service and that he need not be paid by the Iraq Government direct. The/7. Tho source of the payment need not be known. HIS EXCELLENCY then said that he would not mind paying the Director himself. It was not a question of money. v /hat he objected to was the proposal itself, and he did not see the necessity for it since smuggling could be stopped without it. The Iraq Government could take the same measures themselves as Ibn Saud had done. ICR. LAITE^AITE said that this might lead to very serious complications which H.M.G. were most anxious to avoid, H.M.G-,, however, much appreciated the suggestions which His Excellency had now made for a settlement and as the Sheikh was reluctant to agree to the appointment of a British Customs Director, 'they would make a further attempt to reach a settlement with Iraq on the basis of those suggestions.f/ : - f 3- a v 7f~Sr ** • SI /L4 , S*u.

'Violation of Kuwait Territorial Waters by Iraq Customs Launch'. Sir, A With reference to my telegram No. 239 dated the E5th July 1935, I have the honour to enclose for your information (a) translation of letter No.R-4/E114 dated 24th July 1935 from the Deputy Ruler of Kuwait. (b) Testimony of Ibrahim al Faudari, the Kuwait light keeper in Maschan Island given to myself. /IV $ ,0 V 0 f)' 2, Both documents speak for themselves and my only regret is that the other three occasions (men tioned by the light keeper in para 2 of his testimony) on which the IRAQ, Customs launch was seen operating round Maschan Island in June last were not reported at the time, so that I could have taken them up officially. 3, As I have had occasion to remark in earlier A* despatches dealing with similar piratical operations of the IRAQ, Customs launch in Kuwait waters and more especiallyespecially in the r, na^rows ,, between Maschan Island and the Subiyeh promontory, owners of Kuwait water and other boats plying between Kuwait and Fao , who have had their launches held up and searched, will always refuse to give any evidence against the IRAQ Customs jkacxBxk authorities for fear of reprisals at the Fao end, where it will soon be known who gave the show away. Hence no reports have come in or have been furnished by actual owners of boats of the incidents complained of. 4# Nor in the present case would the story of the visit of the Customs launch on the 9th July have come to light, I think, had not His Excellency Shaikh Abdulla As Salim, the Deputy Ruler, himself visited Falaika Island on EOth July and Maschan on 81st July - It was while there that he learned of the visits of the IRAQ, launch on 9th July, as well as of the other three visits in June. On his return to Kuwait, His iiscellency came personally to the Agency and reported the matter, but as he rightly put it, the June incidente had happened so long ago that it would only make Kuwait look ridi culous if he were to take them up now, hence he pro posed protesting officially only in respect of the 9th July visit of the IRAQ Launch. 6. You are aware of course that the Islands of Falaika, Maschan and Bubiyan all belong to Kuwait and if you will examine the sketch map which I enclose and which is drawn to scale, you will see that the follow ing points undoubtedly fall within Kuwait f s territorial waters limit;- isl- 3 - (a) Khor Subiyeh, throughout its length. (b) The channel between Subiyeh Point (note the position of low water) and Masohan Island. (o) The channel between Falaika Island and Maschan Island. 7 After all the correspondence which took place over exactly similar violations of Kuwait waters previously (see this office letter Nos» 245 and C—1^2 dated the 11th October 1933 and 18th May 1934 respec tively connected letters), it comes as a distinct shook to l^afn that IRAQ Customs officials learned nothing and are apparently starting theii\ old tactics again. 8 # In this connection it is of added interest to peruae the 5th to 8th line of para 4 of Foreign Office Note of 1st July 1935 describing a talk, which Mr. Rendel had in London with His Excellency Nuri Pasha on the subject of Kuwait smuggling and which was for warded under your Printed Letter No. 536-S dated the 30th July 1935. If 0 9 # it will be noted that I have only sent you the testimony of the man Ibrahim al Faudari. The evidence of the other witnesses (mentioned by Shaikh Abdulla and the light keeper himself) being exactly the same as that of the light keeper, I did not think it worth while to record. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

On that day the launch came oiiit from the n IQior Sabbiyeh n , and when it reached the 'Mafrass' (the centre or the deep water channel in the shallow water between between Maschan and Sabbiyeh, along which the sailing ships can pass), it seized a sailing ship bound for Basra (Fao) and released it after a while# The launch then cast anchor in the centre o^Mafrass 1 (deep water channel) near the n Yahi tt on the north side of Masehan till 6 o'clock Arabic time (1 P .M.)* Then it moved westward, and came close in to Masehan island, to a distance od about a quarter of a mile or less, and cast ankhor there. At about 8 o'clock Arabic time (3 P.M.) the launch noticed a sailing ship coming from Kuwait, and followed it up to the 'Mafrass'. There the sailing ship east anchor and the launch tied up to it. At 10 o^lock Arabic time (5 P .M.) a small 'balam' belonging to the man in charge of the Maschan light appeared coming from Kuwait. The launch detached from the sailing ship and followed tiie said Maschan 'balBim'. But as it came closer to it near the shore and saw that it carried nothing but a supply of water, the launch gave up the chase and proceeded to an to her sailing ship that was coming from Kuwait, again fastened to it^ a little while, and then let it go. The launch/ 1- 2 - The launah then returned to the first sailing ship at about sunset, (which had not evidently been allowed to depart). At 2 o'clook Arabic time at night (9 P.M.) the launch sailed right round Maschan proceeding in a westwardly direction in the first place, till it returned to her start ing point near where the held up sailing ship was, and cast anchor there about 4 o , cloclc Arabic time at night (11 After that time both the launch and the sailing ship left. I have therefore ordered Ibrahim al~Faudari to report to you so that you may take his evidence. is the man who lives on Maschan island, and is one of the witnesses who saw the launch. The remaining witnesses will if necessary be sent to you at once. Please note carefully the case and refer it to the authorities concerned as early as possible in order to prevent the said launch from infringing the territorial waters of Kuwait. I am afraid such action on the part of Fao customs launch will give rise to misunderstanding owing to its frequent wanderings and repeated interference with the sailing ships near coasts where it has no right to interfere with anyone at all.

I live with my family on the Maaohan island, having been appointed by His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait to look after the 'beacon 1 * set up there for the use of sailing ships using the Maschan-Sabbiyeh channel. In my spare time I do some n fishing n from the island. Besides my family I have got with me on the island four assistant fishermen. We make the whole population of that small island. 2. On the morning of Tuesdaythe 7th Rabi* ^hani 1354 (9th July 1935) at about 2 o*clock Arabic time (9 A.M.) as we were starting out on our daily work of attending the fish tra^a we noticed the Fao customs launch known as the 'Moctor al-Aswad n (the black launch) coming out of the Khur Sabbiyeh and approaching our island. It was the same n black launch' which we have in the past noticed visiting our waters bet- ween Maschan and Sabbiyeh, and which as recently^as last month (June) we saw on three occasions. 3. On this occasion the launch approahed to within 500 yards of our island, and when it reached the 'Yahi' (a signpost is tailed on some rocks to warn sailing ships of the danger) it held up a n balam n proceeding from Kuwait to Fao and boarded it. The launch tied up alongside the 'balam' in question, and remained with it for about 15 minutes. Leaving the said 'balam' the launch next cast anchor in the channel usually followed by sailing ships, which lies between Maschan island and the promontory of Sabbiyeh (mainland) - though nearer to the former. It remained in that position till 6 o'clock Arabic time (1 P. M.) when it weighed anchor and moving in a semi-circle round Maschan to a point lying west of it, cast anchor close in shore. i i 12 - 4 # After 2 hours io®,. at 8 c ^clook Arabic time (3 P. M. ), noticing another sailing boat coming from Kuwait, the launch again weighed anchor and made for it (the boat) so as to cut it off* It caught up with it near the 'Yahi', forced it to anchor, and tied up alongside for about 2 hourso Both launch and n balam Tt remained at anchor. 5. At 10 o'clock Arabic time (5. P.M.) my own small 'balam' used for conveying fish to Kuwait, arrived back from Kuwait with our supply of water etc. The launch to start with followed it for a short distance and then altered course and made for another larger w dhow n which was also seen to be coming from Kuwait. On coming alongside the launch only remained with it for a few minutes. 6. On leaving this last 'balam 1 *, the launch once again returned to its first position near the 'Yahi* 1 where it tied up alongside the w balam n (mentioned in para 3 above) which was still anchored there, and had been apparently forbidden to proceed. 7. Some 2 hours after sunset (i.e.9P »M. ) the launch still clearly visible detached itself from the said tt balam ,t and once again turned in a wide circle, round the west side of Maschan island, and passing through ,, Wakur n (i^e. the channel between Mas khan and Failika islands) came to the same position which it started from i.e« near the w Yahi n and again tied up to the same 'balam^ (para 3 &amp; 6) which was still anchored there. Both^ the launch and the 'balam' were clearly seen by us in the moonlight till 4 o'clock Arabic time (11 P.M.)* After that we turned in for sleep* In the morning they were not visible and must have sailed away with the good shamal breeze which starting blowing that night* 8.

With reference to my despatch No. 451 of August 20th last, I have the honour to inform you that the Shaikh of Kuwait 'broke his return Journey at Bagdad, where he spent three days (September 10th - 13th) as the guest of His Majesty King Ghazi. During this time he had an opportunity of meeting members of the Government and paid formal calls on the Prime Minister and the Minister of Interior. A dinner party was given in his honour 'by Yasin Pasha on September 13th. 2. I gather that the smuggling question, as a subject of conversation, was purposely exchewed during the visit. 3. Prior to the Shaikh^ arrival, I had pressed the Prime Minister to let me know how the Iraqi Government viewed the proposals which had emerged from the conferences in London. He had given me to understand that the Council of Ministers had carefully considered these proposals but had reached the conclusion that no useful purpose would be served 'by further parley; and that the time had arrived for the Government to make their own dispositions with a view to curtail smuggling from Kuwait and, if possible, to end it altogether, 4. On September 11th, I received a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the relevant portion of which reads as follows 'In The Hight Honourable Sir Samuel tJ*G* Hoare, Bt. p Cr« G» o* X« , G - . , etc., etc., etc.- 2 - 'In view of the continuance of, and increase in the smuggling from Kuwait, and the evil effect which it has had and continues to have on the administration and finances of Xraq 9 it has heen decided to carry out the measures referred to 'by the Ministry in their note of August 10th and to initiate measures to combat the smuggling forthwith.' 6. As the note of August 10th did not, in fact, state the steps contemplated 'by the Iraq.i Government, I made infernal enquiries at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and also put a direct question on the subject to the Prime Minister. It is unlikely that I shall receive a detailed reply from the Ministry. Indeed, it would be too much to expect the Govern ment to put all their cards on the table, since the essential element of success will probably be surprise. i;# Yasin rasha assured me, however, that the new measures contemplated by the Iraqi Government were preventive only, and onat he had given strict orders that there were to be no incur sions into Kuwait territory. He said that it was not the intention of the Iraqi Government to attempt to keep up a continuous patrol of the frontier with the forces at present at their disposal. This would be a superhuman task and would not be so effective as the tactics at present employed. His policy is largely experimental and consists of organising raids in force on smuggling convoys, whenever their movements can be ascertained with reasonable certainty beforehand. Several affrays in the desert have already been reported in the press, resulting in valuable captures by the Police, and Yasin Pasha seemed satisfied that if these tactics are vigorously pursued, they %ill, especially when the new materiel arrives, prove to be a severe check on the smugglers* activities.

Reference para. 166 of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.14. (a) The Shaikh returned to Kuwait froii Cairo by Imperial Airways on Saturday, 14th September, having broken his journey in Bagdad for 3 days to pay his respects to H.M. King Ghazi. (b) Whilst in Bagdad the Shaikh was entertained at an official banquet by H.E» Yasin Pasha at which the members of the Iraq cabinet were present. The Shaikh expressed the deepest gratification at the honour so done him, and % especially at the arrangements which were made at the Air Port where a guard of honour with a band etc. was in att endance. (c) The Shaikh informed the writer that whilst in Bagdad, he paid a visit to H.E. Rashid Ali, Minister of Interior, and had a long private and friendly discussion regarding the date gardens. At this meeting the Shaikh said that he asked why it was that the Iraq Government could not treat him as a neighbouring and friendly ruler, and well wisher, instead of as a criminal who had no rights. According to the Shaikh, he told Rashid Ali that among Arabs the honourable treatment of neighbours, was looked upon as one of the greatest and most sacred things in life after God, and he appealed to the Minister as a noble Arab himself to do his best to see that he Jthe Shaikh| received more con sideration and honourable treatment from the Iraq Government than heretofore. The Shaikh said that the Minister appealed genuinely touched by this appeal, and Pro, 0iai ^ to ,0- 2 - and promised to do all he could to see that the gardens disput et was dealt with on a 'higher plane' and with less intent to hurt than in the past* (d) As regards his treatment by His Majesty's Governments representatives of all grades in London^ the Shaikh spoke most enthusiastically, and to use his words, 'From H.M. the King's most gracious person and downwards, I was welcomed as only the English know how to welcome a stranger within their gates, and from the moment I landed at Dover, I was made to feel that I was indeed in my own home and among people who bore me a real affection. 11 (e) The Shaikh spoke particularly highly of the kind and sympathetic treatment which he received from Lord Zetland Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office, as well as from Foreign Office officials, he came in contact with# (f) The Shaikh appeared to have been also much touched by the kindly encouragement given him by H .M. the King at the Royal Audience and by the thoughtful care which had been taken by the India Ofiice to bring together various old friends (notably Sir P.Cox and Admiral Sir Martin Dunbar-Nasmith,VC^HN) on the occasion of the banquet which the India Office honoured him with. (g) As regards his visit to Damascus, Haifa, Jesuralem, Amman, Cairo and Alexandria (at which last place he incidentally called on the Vice-Admiral Forbes, Cotamander- in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet), the Shaikh expressed the deepest gratitude for all that had been done to make his tour a happy and agreeable onei as he himself put it 'Every English official and every Arab Notable seeoied bent on doing me honour and letting the world know that little Kuwait existed on the map'. The persons he especially singled out for his thanks, were H.M*s Consul in Damascus, the Gover- nolf of Haifa, the Amir Abdulla and the port Authorities at Aleaandria, and he expressed the hope that his grateful delation fo. ' ■ Iappreciation for what those officials had done for him could be in some way conveyed to those ofticials. (h) For the rest the Shaikh oilked wonderfully well, on his arrival at Kuwait and a far more happy, contented and fit man than I have seem him for years past# (1) As for the people of Kuwait, the safe return of their Shaikh and ruler, was celebrated by scenes of the most amazing enthusiasm and loyalty that it has been the lot of the writer to see in an oriental country, (in this connection see para 126 of Kuwait Summary No.tl)* One never f*r a moment guessed that the people of Kuwait had auch deep and genuine affection for their Ruler. It was quite touching sight to see 'weeping 1 * tribesmen and tw)bnsmen striving with each other to seize and kiss the hands of their Shaikh and Maste r, and to hear the ululations and cries of welcome from some 2000 women (many of gantle i birth) who had collected at the gate of the city by which he entered. At a very conservative estimate 25,000 persons were on the a^gfeodrome, excluding several thousand Bedouin who had come from places far in the interior to welcome their Chief home. Of this number quite 4000 managed to fight their way to the Shaikh and embrace him. (j) Although every precaution had been taken to to control the crowd by means of 300 police and armed men, who were drawn up in double line from the aeroplane to the reception shed, the crowd was not to be denied, and no sooner hpd the Shaikh descended from the aircraft and reached the shed, than a wild rush took place, which swept police, armed men, and controlling o ficers off their legs. For a full hour the crowd took charge, and even the Political Agent asristed the police in their fight to ket:p a klear space round the Shaikh. The latter had a smile and kind word for every person. (k)XXX (k) Once clear from the aerodrome the Shaikh made it his first duty to go and see his aged mother t after which he proceeded to Basman and to his wife end children. COMMENT » I have described the above in detailvof set purpose as behind t his extraordinary welcome of the people of Kuwait, there appeared to be something far deeper than mere Joy at the teturn of their Ruler, One had not to see far to know what this was, In the eyes of his subjects the Shaikh had gone to England In July to fight a M dire and immediate peril H t The belief then was widespread ( and unfortunately nothing that the writer could do or say appeared to have mftch of a reassuring effect) that Iraq qas to be given political control over Kuwait by His Majesty's Government, but ^Their Shaikh had 'appealed to Caesar 1 *, and had won recognition and Justice, Kuwait was saved, and ^jtoodsliedl aid perhaps worse had been avoided***#C 0 N F i D E H f i A L.

Sir, 1 have the honour to refer to Mr. Batema^a despatch No.527' of 2nd October to His Majesty's Secretary of State for foreign Affairs. 2. The present Juncture appears to be a farourable one for summarising briefly the subject of Kuvrait - 'Iraq Smuggling as dealt with in the numerous despatches and telegrams which in the course of the last three years and more have been exchanged between the various authorities concerned. It is common ground that under International Law and practise the Shaikh of Kuwait has the undoubted right to refuse cooperation in anti-smuggling measures with the 'Iraq Government^who are responsible for carrying out such measures as they thinlc fit. 3. His Majesty's Government however, considered it of considerable importance that the Shaikh should in practice afford cooperation for the following main reasons* (a) to exercise a good effect on the 'Iraq Government whoa - 2 - who regarded Kuw&amp;it as under our influence 9 and loolced to us to exert this influence in order that the question might be settled in an amicable manner* (to) To preserye amicable relations between Kuwait and ♦Iraq. (c) To avoid the possibility of complications between these two States into which His Majesty's Government might be dragged. His Majesty's Government considered for instance, thst if Kuwait were to suffer severely from what ever enti-smuggling measures 'Iraq might adopt they - His Maj ( -sty^ Government - would be compelled eventually to inter vene on behalf of Kuwait. 4. The measures which His Majesty's Government considered the Shaikh should take were in the nature of an effective check in some form or other (various schemes were explored at various times) on the export of goods by land and sea from Kuwait. 5. The Shaikh, while accepting a measure of cooperat ion by see (the snuggling on which ^ras carried out by Kuwaitis) was unwilling to cooperate with the 'Iraq Government on land - where the smugglers were practically all ' Traqtis, and where by far the greater volume of smuggling took place* He raised various objections to the various schemes put forward, amongst others that his giving effect to some of them would affect his sovereign rights* His main reason, however, for refusing cooperation was as follows. Whether Kuwait trade wifch 'Iraq ^as stopped by (i) the •Iraqis at the frontier or (2) by himself at Kuwait, Kuwait would of ccurse sulier. If his subjects Suffered under (l) they would naturalxy hold him free of any responsibility in the matter.c? - 3 - matter. If, howerer, they ouffered under (2) they would hold him responaible, and he would become the object of considerable unpopularity which might result in more or lees serious internal troubles. 6. The Shaikh explained that provided the 'Iraq Grorernment, in whatever anti-smuggling measures they adopted, kept witnin the law (the •Iraqi customs officials have been guilty from time to time of highhanded and illegal acts in Kuwait territory and territorial waters) he certainly would not expect His Majesty f s Government to intervene on his behalf. ?• His Majesty's Government, however, in spite of thea arguments were gener&amp;lly of opinion that H pressure' should be applied to the Shaikh to induce him to cooperate* 8. Taking the above situation as it appeared to me I held, and hold, the following viev/s moat strongly. It is of course very desirable that the question should be settled amicably between the two States, but aa a first point British interests are not directly concernedt if British goods intended for ♦ Iraq cannot enter Kuwait they will be taken to Basra. ifor His Hajesty^ Government to bring , »preBsure w to bear on the Shaikh in order to induce him to cooperate would have a moat unfortunate effect on thn Ruler himself, his subjects, generally throughout the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, and probably further afield in other Arab countries of the Middle East, whose Press in these days takes considerable interest in this part of the world. However excellent the intention/of His Majesty's Government might be this action would give the impreaaion to Arab public opinion that we were pressing hard a small state which was under our protection in the interests of a 1%^er- 4 - larger state which was not, Moreorer in the last resort 'pressure' would mean a direct order to the Shaikh from Eia Hajesty•a Gorernment to fall in with their Tiews, and if he refused (as I thought from the strength of his feelings on the subject was extremely likely) I did not see how His Mejesty^ Government proposed to enfcrce this order, and a deplorable situation would then be brought about between the Shaikh and His Majesty^ G over ran en t. I felt also that there was considerable weight in the Sheikh's arguments touched on in the last sentence of paragraph 5 above, and pointed out that should the Shaikh give way under our 'pressure', and should feeling in Kuwait turn against him, the respons1fc 1 1 ity for the consequences would - at any rate to a large extent - be His Majesty^ Governments, 9. r ith regard to the argument put forward in para- £raph 3 (c) ab^ve. My views were that any blockade which ni ;ht be initiated by the ♦Iraq Governmsnt was on an entirely difJ erent footing to the baudi blockade, since His Majesty^ -overnnent had no respondibility whatsoever with regard o t hf former, but had given a definite assurance to the Shajkh that they would do their best to get the latter removed. In view moreover of the Shaikh's definite state ment given in paragraph 6 above, I did not see how His Majesty 's Government could be compelled to interfere on his behalf if the •Iraq Government actually instituted this blockade* 10. In view of t hese considerations I urged His Majesty's Government that our approach to the Shaikh on the object should not proceed beyond 'strong fdvice', which if is regard.d would place the reaponaibUity for the consequences ent ir ely- 5 - entirely on him. In deference to my riewe Jfte Majesty^ G oa era ment (Tide paragraph 4 of India Office telegram No. 724 of 6th March 1935 to me' concurred. Sometime later both V j His excellency the Ambassador (vide my telegram Ko.5l8 of 15th June 1933) and th^ 'rovernrr^nt of India (vide their telegram No. 149.r Of. Tune 6th, 1935) concurred generally in my Tiews. 11. The 3n».ikh then proceeded to England Ipgt June for medio?il treatment, and opportunity was taken of his presence in London for him to have conversations with the India and Foreign Offices the result of vrhich is detsiled In India Office Printed Letter Bo.X.2.4923/5^ dated 19th Jul^ 19?5. Briefly the Shaikh was persuaded by His ifejeaty^ aovernment to the extent of instituting a ^ Vt manifest system for goods leaving by land for 1 Irao as well as by se?. The further proposal of l British Customs Direct or^ however^ he definitely r efused to consider. IP,, The measure of copperation whveh the Shaikh is willimg to give has now been placed before the * Iraq Government (vide paragraph 3 of Mr. Bateman's despatch) who are of opinion th&amp;t it does net go far enough, and are therefore instituting measures to curtail, and if possible to end altogether smuggling from Kuwait. Ith regard to these measures. The 'Iraq Gov ernment h*ve always made great play wl tn the considerable expense which they would be put to in instituting anti- smuggling measures, Ps long ago as November 1934 1 IV 1 ^ pointed out (vide paragraph 6 (a) of letter Ko.lO^d-S, dated 20th TTovember 1934) that they could quite well cogence operationsno - 6 - operations with active patrols of a few cars carrying machine guns, and armed crews^ the meintainence of which would cost little, and that if these measures were not effective they could try more extensive ones. His Majesty 's Government thought this surest ion a reasonable one (vide paragraph 4 of telegram Ho«47 dated 9th February 1955 frotn His M&amp;j eaty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Maj esty'f! Ambassador, Bagdad). The measures which tho • Ira^ CJovernment have now instituted, as detailed in paragraph 6 of Mr* Batema^s despatch, and from information which I received in Kuwait, appear to be precisely those which I suggested could be adopted. The Iraqi Government moreover (vide Yasin Pasha's conversation with ttr. Bateman) are of opinion that these measures are proving extremely affective. This view is confirm med from vjhat I heard in Kuwait from Colonel Dickson. According to the ia tter*s information t he capture of the smuggling caravan described in paragraph 178 of Kuwait Intellig- ence Summary No. 15, has had a most salutary effect, As far as the Shaikh is concerned, far from being upset at the success -e of the 1 Iraqi anti-amug^lin^ activities, he appears to be positively relieved, since their efficiency presumably precludes any further representations to him from Kin Majesty's Govern ment on the subject of cooperation regarding which his feelings are as strong as ever. 14. I cannot help feeling that the course of events so far has justified the attitude which I have taken up with regard to this question. His Majesty's Government having relinquished the policy of ♦♦pressure^on the Shaikh to cooperate with 'Iraq, have done all that was practible in the circumstances by giving himn( - 7 - hi» 'strong adTice 11 . This advice he has only adopted In part (vide paragraph 11 cbove) and the respongibility for the consequences is tharefore entirely his© The 'Iraq Oorernment hare in consequence instituted certain anti-smuggl ing measures which are enonomical and eff ict.ciouiu The Shaikh on his side in quite content to face these measures provided always that the ^raq Government keep within the law- an assurance on which point has been given by them (vide first sentence of jr . ragraph 6 of lir, Bateman's despatch), 15. With regard to paragraph Q of Mr, Bateman 1 s despatch* The r eperaussions in Ba&amp;dad of the let est developments of the smuggling question are of course outside my sphere, but I venture to give it as my personal opinion that our case with the 'Iraq Government in the event, as Mr # Bateman suggests, of our hearing further from them is an excellent one. The Shaikh, as we have informed them more than once, is an independent ocvereign in special treaty relations with aa» In the present instance there was nothing in these treaties in particular, or in international law in general, to compel him to cooperate, anl His Majesty's Government therefore took the only steps open to them by giv ing certain advice whicti the Bhaikh did not adopt. The 'Iraq Government must therefore follow the example of all other Governments in the world, (more particularly of those governments v.hich - like 'Iraq - choose to erect high tariff barriers) and institute effective enti-smugglinj measures* (In point of fact they have already done this). On his side the hhaxkh must take the consequences of the measures. (He is in fact quite prepared to do so). If the case had been diilerent, xf it had been a matter cr the 'Iraq Government from j demanding some act ion xxx^xjuacbtfJcxj^he Shaikh under some article of7v - 8 - of his agreements with us f or which he was bound by Internation al Law to carry out, and His Majesty 's GrOTernment had failed to induce him to take this action^then indeed the *Iraq Govern ment would have had a legitimate ground for coJiplaint» As it is it seems to me they hare none. 16. *7ith regard to the effect on Britiah prestige in the Gulf f mentioned by Mr* Bateman in hiu paragraph 9 f I can assure His Majesty's Government that no ill effects will follow the present course taken by tne smuggling question. The Arebs of the Persian Gulf otatesj both lulers and subjects, will quite understand that British interests are not involved, and that His ^'ajesty^s Government have merely acted as dis interested peace makers in trying to settle the question amicab ly between the two states by giving the Shaikh certain advice# * That the Shaikh, not being compelled either by law or treaty to cooperate, and presumably being the besu judge o^hi« own interests, has chosen not to follow this advice. That the responsibility for the consequences must now entirely rest on hinu This being so if Kuwait suffers,aa she probably will from the 'Iraqi anti-smuggling activities, no feeling whatever 4r in any quarter will be directed ageinst His l^jesty's Government* ■ Whether •Iraq will incur unpopularity or not ii hardly a matter which concerns me very much# 1 hazard,however, the following remarks. Inside Kuwait there will probably be some soreness against •Iraq, but outside it in the other Arab States I think it will be generally recognised that the Shaikh cannot have it both waysi that if he chooses to exercise his undoubted right of non-cooperation the 'Iraq Government have every reason to exercise~ 9 ~ (jcenise theirs of instituting anti-smuggling measures# I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of Inaia, Hia Majesty^ Ambassador, Bagdad, and the political Agent, Kuwait.

Vvl^ J***** Just a short line to tell you something of Sir Andrew Ryan and 3ir ^ Glark-Kerr 1 s visits and to enclose a nice letter which I received yesterday from the latter• 2, Sir undrew arrived (10 A.M.) with De G-aury on 14th November by Victoria, and left on 17th November (9 A.M.) for Bahrain also by Victoria. 3 # Sir A .Clark-Kerr, Lady Clark-^err, Gapt.Holt, and an Additional Secretary all arrived on 17tii November at 11.30 A.M. by Victoria and left again at 5 P.M. onlSth by Nearchus. 4 # vfe had some difficulty in accommodating the embassador 's Second oecretary especially as no previous notice had been sent us that he was arriving. However we fixed him up in Groning's Office somehow. 5 # Both visits were quite a success, and both the Shaikh and I were very glad of the opportunity to discuss certains problems affecting Iraq., saudi Arabia and Kuwait with our distinguished guests. I should have liked the xiHibassador to stop longer, and told him I hoped he would find time to run down to Kuwait again before long. 5^ Both Sir A.Ryan and Sir A.Clark-Kerr, I think, were pleased with their visits, and learned a good deal from the Shaikhs owa lips, of his side to proulems that a-feet all of us. rj^ Sir ^.ndrev/ discussed the Saudi -olockade fu±ly with me and talked about the latest proposals for settling the Blue Line business. He said some nice things about my Hurra Map, and plied me with lots more questions re the Lurra txi^e The Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fcwle ,0,^.^. , ^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,11./ Murra tribe. He also got me to correct place names in Kuwait Principality for the K # G.3» He seemed full of genuine sympathy for Kuwait in the matter of the Blockade, and I think made the ShaikM feel that he was out to help. The Shaikh did not say much,except once when he urged Sir ^ndrew to remember in dealing with the Blockade problem to hold the scales evenly balanced between him and Bin Saud, and to forget that the latter was a great and important ruler, and he only a very small person. 3. The ^iiabassador asked the Shaikh ana myself several questions about the smuggling business and how the new efforts of the Iraq Government to put smuggling down were faring. Ke seemed gratified to hear frcm both of us that smuggling was reduced by over half, and I think I convinced him that if ■present measures were continued vigorously there was no A slackening off,the problem would solve itself. To me privately he said that what tbe Iraq G-overnment did not like y /as the expense such operations entailed. I did not quite liice to say that the cost of keeping a patrol of five armed ^ord cars at Safwan, a dhow and launch, in the iihor ^ubair (and possibly another car patrol at Busaiya, not yet located) could not be very ^reat seeing that tnese units already e--ist0Q. as psrt of the Police force of Iraq, but I think I implies what I thought. 9 # The Ambassador made one striking remark to me to the effect that he was quite satisfied himself thau une Iiaq Government had no ulterior designs v /hatsoever on Kuwait cj .nd that he hoped I would tell the Shaikh this. 1 q # i n a final talk between the Ambassador and the Shaikh the latter dealt with the accusations emanating from Iraq that arms and ammunition got through from Kuwait to the Iraq tribes. The Shaiish assured the .umbassador that in this matte.?, he had always and would always give Iraq the most vigorous and whole hearted support, and explained fully the steps taken to prevent such traffic.II, On the 18tli I took the Ambassador round the bazaars, and into the country by car to give him an idea of our hinterland. I also gave him afe Bedouin lundi among jolack Tents* That the .jnbassador was gratified with what he saw I think may be seen from the nice letter he sent me (enclosed). * . r&gt; p/l.6./ ( jv J J: No.0-535.

In the case of the ohaikh 1 s launch I thou^at (it seems erroneously) that the Customs Department would see their way to grant the usual courtesy treatment provided I wrote thoai a letter, as I would have done had it been a case of the Shaikh's motor car. 5. The Shaikh should in point of fact, have asked me to write my letter before he sent his launch to Fao, and his initial mistake in not doing so is unfortunate and to be regretted, ^t the same time in view of my subsequent letter to the Director of Customs, I think it would have been a gracious act to have either accepted my explanation or released and sent the launch back to Kuwait, if Customs rules prevented customary courtesies being extended to launches.

In^fringoment of Kuwait territorial waters by Iraqi G us t oms Laun oh. ^ / Reference your oonfidential printed letter No^909-S, dated 50th ITovember 19S5 and enclosare, 2, The following stand out as salient points in reading the Iraq Ministry for Forei,,-- .a.r?airs letter ho»0/o0o«3, dated l-.th M. ni Nov an be r 1935, as ell as previous correspondence^ f • (a) Kuwait claims that an ariied Iraqi Customs launch not only appeared in Kuwait waters ^t the entrance of the Bay of Kuwait, but that it anchored in them for many hours, and held up, searched, and delayed several Kuwait sailing craft ^oing about their normal business• That this all took place in the immediate vicinity of Maschan Island, a point at least 50 miles from the iBarest Iraqi territorial waters, further that the launch was seen by four reliable witnesses to come out of the Khor Subiyeh &lt;■ before it started its operations round Maschan Island which lasted for some 16 hours. (b) On the other hand Iraq, replying some five months after the above complaint was officially transmitted to her, flatly denies the incident and replies- 2 - (i) That their Gust cms launoh'Mid not cross into Kuwait waters Tt : (ii)That no doubt the accusations were made at the instance of the Kuwait smugsling fraternity, and so must be accepted for what they were worth . 2. The point that at once strikes one forcibly is that the Iraq Foreign Office merely denies M that their Customs launch crossed into Kuwait waters'. Here perhaps lies the ^root' of the divergence of state -ments mentioned above, and It would be interesting, not to say extremely useful, if the Iraq Government could be asked to define exactly where they considered their ov®i territorial waters to end, and where they regarded Kuwait territorial waters to begin, talcing a straight line from the mouth of the Shatt al iiXub to Kuwait Town.. i 4 # Naturally If the Iraq Oovemment considers that Bubiyan, Maschan and Falaika Islands belong to them then the presence of their launches roundabout the entrance of Kuwait harbour will be interpreted quite differently to what we in Kuwait understand to be the position. I personally am quite satisfied from the evidence produced and from subsequent reports received by me of a confirmatory nature, tiiat the armed launch in question did operate at the points stated, that is to say (a) That it was inside tile c3ubiyeh channel, (b) That it held up boats between Has Subiyeh and Maschan. (c) That it sailed round iiaschan Island and anchored S00 yards on its north side for several hours: and the Iraq Government's flat denial merely begs the question, unless it actually claims the Khor oubiyeh and Iiaschan Islands to be part of Iraq territory. It is a noticeable point that she only denies 'that the launch was in Kuwait waters', she does not in any way deny that it visited the spots mentioned in the Kuwait complaint. ^ ^ ^ Lt.-Colonel, Political iigent,Kuwait,Confidential. %.b or No.1020-3 of 1935.

Sir, 'J i I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with Note No.G/5033, dated the 12th November 1935, from the Irpqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs to your address and to enclose herewith a copy of an 'Express Letter, No*C-348, dated the 9th December 1935, from the Political^ Agent, Kuwait. \ Jr * 2. As Colonel Dickson points out (paragraph 2 (b) of his letter) the Iraqi Government delayed a considerable time (actually about three months) before replying, and their reply when received - consisting merely of a brief end flat denial of the encroachment - seems to me unsatis factory. The Note from the Irpq Government refers to the strict orders issued prohibiting the encroachment of Kuwait waters by Customs launches, but it is not so much a question of the issue of orders as of ensuring that these orders are carried out. There are of course two sides to every complaint but the evidence of the encroachment in this particular case appears to be strong, and the Iraq Government have mr de no attempt to refute ita 3. In my letter No.ioge-S, dated the 27th November A 1934 / TV1° 4 -2- 1934(copy to India Office, Gorernnent of India and Politic 1 Agent, Kuwait, under Residency Printed Letter KO.1099-S ol same date) I summed up the illegal and high-handed acts committed by Iraqi Customs officials in Kuwait territoty and territorial waters. Since then there iu s occurred the incident forming the subject of this despatch. 4. Briefly then, during the last three years the ihaikh hae complained of some eight outrages and encrorchments committed by Iraqi officials against Kuwait and in no single instance haTe the Iraqi Government offered any reparation whatever, I quite realise the extreme difficulty of extract ing any such reparation from the Iraqi Government, if they take the line - as they do - of flatly denying that the incidents complained of have actually taken place. At the game time I think 1 should point out that it is embarrassing for me to continue to receive complaints ol inoiaents from the Shaikh, and to have to inform him in due course that no redress is forthcoming. Moreover - what is much more important - the negative result of the many complaints which ' he has had to submit may well undermine his faith in the ability of His Majesty's Government to protect his interests.

On the S^th Jamad. Thani (25th Sept. aa 'w— ■ 1935) the Fao customs motor launch appeared and lade to.vards ^c- them. The launch fired three shots at them, and shouted at ^ A them to draw near, mien they (the three men) came alongside the launch, they and their little jollyboat were a once seized, me. the following dlsoooree tooK plaoe tet.o.n tl.0 nakhuda the launch personnel • Nakhuda - What do you want of us? Personnel - We are taking you to ?ao. Nakhuda - lhat is our fault? Personnel - You have come here for nothing hut smuggling sugar, Nakhuda -Our 'boat is so small and lealcs so 'badly that it is not possiole for it/ to hold sugar. Moreover, we are not people who go in for carrying sugar: Y You yourselves can see our 'boat half-, loaded with firewood. Personnel -We must take you to ijao. They were then in fact towed to Fao, and their statement having heen taken, they were humiliate! and were asked to pay_I.D.5/- for the jollyhoat, and 1.0.3/- for themselves; am in case of failure they would, they were toid, 'he imprisoned. Tne NaKhuda replied that they were not onlyl^lns their 4.11, fool too. the people of Ko es it- 2 - / fr* people of Fao as it was, iDut were, in the worst state of destitution, and could find no money to pay nor could they 'borrow it from anyone. The Fao authorities, however, would not listen to his entreaties. They, the Kuwait sailors, were accord ingly cast into prison and after 'being subjected to much humiliation, they/at last released on the 10th Ramadhan 1354 (6.12.35Kallowed to return home. Thieir jollyboat was however confiscated and kept at ITao. 'Hie nakhuda Hasan 'bin Muhammad got 'back to Kuwait on the 20th Ramadhan (16.12.35) and in the worst state of health. I regret, indeed, to have to report such 'barbarous treatment from the officials at Fao, who continue to exceed all limits of decent 'behaviour, and every few weeks venture into Kuwait waters and disturb and illtreat poor people like the ahovementioned nakhuda. Often and often I have explained to you and given you exact details verbally and in writing of these sort of occurrenceg on the part of the crew of the Fao Customs launch, and I have pointed out that these violations were inconsistent with the principle of good neighbourhood. But I regret to say that I have not heard any satisfactory result as yet. In view of the friendly relations exsisting 'between us and our neighbour the Government of Iraq., we are much concerned and disappointed at this violation of our rights, and the continued activities of the ahovemen^ioned launch within territorial waters of Kuwait. Is it right, I ask, for them to use firearms against such poor people, and to threatne them, and try and make them say that they were carrying sugar? what justice and what mercy allows such acts to 'be done.* In very truth this sort of thing can only end in the rupture of those friendly we relations which have for so long and with such difficulty 'been trying to maintain with our neighbour Iraq.. As for the officials of the said department (Customs) they will no doubt once again completely deny their guilt. Nevertheless, what I have said is what actually happened, and is the entire truth, if the iraa n - averment does oot w- 3 - jd dcxnot wish to 'believe what is talcing place or has no desire to prevent the said launch from these infringements, we shall , | 'be cpmpelled to seize it next time it enters our waters. Before doing anything so strong as this, however, we feel we ought to issue this warning and ask the Iraq. Government not to raise objection, if we are compelled to take the law into our hand. God knows we least of all desire np regrettable ' i - I -- - M-l ,^1 %0 &gt;*A incident 'but the Iraq.

Usual Ending.11^ 11^ GONPIDENTIAL N o.c /5 of 1936. Office of the Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf, camp, B ahrain. Dated the 18th January, 1936 From - The Hon'ble Lieut .-Colonel T.C.^owle, C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - His Excellency The Ambassador, British Embassy, Bagdad. In continuation of my letter iao»1020 -3, dated the 20th December 1935. I have the honour to enclose herevritn a copy of Express Letter ^o.C-A, dated the 2nd January 1936, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, enclosing a further complaint from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Sabah, Ruler of Kuwait, of yet another outrage on the part of Iraq Customs Officials. The names of the two woodcutters, besides the Hakhuda Hasan bin Mohammed, mentioned by Mis Excellency, are as I have ascertained from Colonel Dickson - Hussain bin Mohammed and Karun bin Safar. 2. It is unfortunate that the incident was not reported earlier to Colonel Dickson by His Sxcellencyi it is now over three months since it occurred. His Sxcellency apparently reported the matter as soon as he heard of it, but his explanation - which I suppose is the explanation of the parties concerned - of the delay in the matter coming to his knowledge is not very satisfactory. His Excellency is a very accessible Subj ect &gt; Kuwait-Iraq Smug 1; ling. Sir, person, /-2- |ftf person, and it seeraa to me tnat either tne women relatives themselves, or some of their men friends, could easily nave approached him with their complaint directly the incident had occurred. However, Arabs are extraordinary dilatory people even where their own interests are concerned. 3. the boatmen state that they were arrested by an Iraq Customs launch in the Khor Subiyeh, and further that there was no contraband in their boat# According to their own account therefore they were seized in Kuwait waters, imprisoned for some three months, and harshly treated, on the mere suspicion of being smugglers. 4. When representations on this incident are made to the Iraq Government the latter will presumably not fail, and rightly from their own point of view, to comment on the delay which has occurred in bringing the case to their notice, they will I imagine not deny the imprisonment, but will declare that the men were smugglers, and were arrested in Iraq waters, and thus the incident will close in the usual unsatisfactory manner* 5. The series of outrages and encroachments committed by Iraqi Customs Officials has now, as I pointed out in paragraph 4 of my letter quoted above, extended over a period of three years. I do not accept all the details of every outrage as proved - the evidence generally has come from the injured and therefore prejudiced parties, and I daresay that in one or two cases the border line between the incidents happening in Kuwait or Iraq waters was a fine one. I am convinced, however that there have been a number of bona fide oases where the Iraqi /-5- 6. / Iraqi Cuatoras Officials have yiolated Kuwait waters, and Kuwait territory, and have treated Kuwait subjects in a higJ-w handed and brutal manner. For instance in May 1934 His Excellency had to complain of incursions of Iraqi armed cars into Kuwait territory. In my opinion these incursions were conclusively proved by - amongst other evidence - tne state- ment of an entirely disinterested and trustworthy witness, ar. Chiaholm of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who happened to be travelling near the scene of the occurrence. liuri Pasha^ reply to Mr. Chisholm's statement was^so absurd that, as I stated in paragraph 3 of my letter no.1121 -3, dated the 2yth November 1934, to Sir Francis Humphrys, it indicated clearly that the Iraq Government had a very bad conscience in the matter. A few months later occurred the Sanam incident, a particularly bad one, in which one Kuwaiti subject was killed, and another severely injured, by an Iraqi patrol,(vide corres- pondence ending with your Printed Letter jso .38 (316/36/34), dated the 1st December 1934 (copy to Foreign Office under Bagdad Printed letter Ho.686, dated the 1st December 1934, and to the Government of India and Political Agent, Kuwait, under ^v&gt;v*V- v Bushire Printed Letter iSo.liai-D, dated the 12th December 1934). Other bad cases were those reported in ^ \ - * my letter Ko.567 -3 of 29th May 1933 (copy to Secretary of State for India, Uovernment of India and Political Agent, Kuwait, under Printed letter r4o.568-S of same date), in which two Kuwaitis were killed and two wounded Kuwait waters, and^^ ^ my letter No»C/l48 of 17th ^lOYember 1933 (copy to Secretary of State for India, Government of India and Political Agent, Kuwait, under Printed letter fio.C/149 of same date), in which two Kuwaitis were killed and ! one wounded in Kuwait waters* Moreover there is no reason to believe that such incidents will not fce repeated in the future.-4- 6. I submit that tnis state of affairs is a deplorable one which cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely* It ia humiliating not only to the Shaikh 9 but also * I venture to add - to His Majesty 9 * Government, and is extremely damaging to our prestige in the -ersian t;-ulf# It also adds another grievance to the two which His Excellency already has against His Majesty's tfoveriment: the inability of the latter t so far, either to implement their 1914 promise covering his date gardens, or to induce King Ibn Saud to raise his blocK^de# The Shaikh of Kuwait is under our protection, and one of our primary duties in this respect is to prevent encroachments of his territory, and ill-treatment of his subjects, by Foreign Powers. this we have obviously failed to do in regard to the outrages of the Iraqi Customs and Polite Officials, since we have neither been able to obtain reparation for these outrages» nor to prevent their recurrence* This failure has of course been due to circumstances beyond our control:i.e* the attitude of the Iraq Government who in reply to representa tions have failed either to offer compensation for the misdeeds of their Customs Officials, or to exercise any effective control over them, (vide paragraph 4 of my letter *o.1020-3 of 20th December 1935). 7. If therefore we are unable to protect the Shaikh in the matter, the logical alternative is for him to protect himself, and Your Excellency will observe from the statenent at the end of his letter to Colonel Dickson that tnis is what he now proposes to do. As pointed out in paragraph 2 of my t.-n telegram No.255 of 3rd March 1935 to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, repeated to the Grovernment of India and His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad, the Shaikh has been most patient /-5- patient under the proTocation of these continued violations of his territory, andVias relied on the representations made by His Majesty's Government on his behalf to the Iraq Govern ment. Since the date of that telegram nearly a year has passed, during which further violations have taken place. In these circumstances personally I am not at all surprised that His Sxcellency now proposes taking effective action himself to deel with the situation, and I venture to suggest that the only course now open to us is to inform the Iraq Government that as the many representations to then in the matter of the actions of their Customs Officials in Kuwait territory and territorial waters have had no effect. His Sxcellency is taking such measures as seem necessary to him to protect his territory and territorial waters from violation, and his subjects from ill-treatment, if necessary by force. That such measures, provided they are confined to the objective stated, and are limited to Kuwait waters, and Kuwait territory, have the entire approval of his Majesty^ Government, and, should the occasion warrant it, of their support. At the same time His Excellency would be informed of this communica tion to the Iraq Government. 8.

This incident, like He predecesaorE, has ended in a complete deadlock, the very circumetantiel Koweiti aissertiona beinf met by flat counter aseertiont from the Iraqi side, together with the ustu^l insinuation th^t the Koweiti authorities ere thenaelvee intereeted in the enu^ling traffic• e have coneulted the India Office and we are both e^reed tHet, subject to the views of the Political Resident, there does not appear to be any advantage in continuinf controversial correspondence with the Iraqi Government about this last incident# It has, however, occurred to us that it mlpht be opportune at this raor^nt w remind the Iraqis of the suggestion which Nuri Hasha himself put forward last summer (see paragraph 4 of your Saving telegram No*21 of the 27th July) i»e» that future cases of alleped infringementki of the Koweiti frontier by Ira i preventive forces should be investi£Bted by the British r Archibald Clerk Kerr, K.C. .G. President/ ^DPY CENT TOPresident of the Basra Court of Sesaions. The irspossibility of obtaining any impartial and reliable reports on euch ineidenta is exemplified by the controversy over the latest incident of tho CuBtoras launch, and althou^, in view of the time that haa elapsed f I doubt whether there would be any advantage in aekinf for an investigation by the British Jud^e into oest incidents, I do think that Nuri Pasha might be reminded of his own proposal, which presumably can be applied to infringements of territorial watere just as well as of the land frontier, Nuri seems to believe in such an idea, since you will remenber that in his conversation with me on 12th June last he referred to the readineas of the Iraqi Government to use a British official to carry out,investigations of frontier incidents (please see our despatch No«424 of 2Cth June). 1 {• f ' f ^ ' 4, I think, therefore, that provided you see no objection it would be most useful if you were to write or speak privately to Nuri with reference to the Iraqi note of the 12th November about the customs launch incident, and tell him that, while you had no intention of embarkinx on a controversy about this particular incident, you were struck by the impossibility of bringing; euch cases to a satisfactory conclusion in default of an impartial inveatigstion# You might then perhaps remind ftiri of his - r* suggestion es described in your savinf telegram No#21 of ?7th July, and enquire whether the Iraqi Govemnent would not be prepared, in future cases of allefed violations of Koweiti territory or territorial waters, to instruct the British Jucke at Basra to make an investic^tion into the facts.

C/3033 of the 12th November could be regarded as an adequate replj Jg the representations contained in this i^ubass^ ^ note i r o. 422 of the 20th August, since no evidence had been produced in support of the statement that the customs launch did not enter Kuwaiti territorial waters. I said, that, as five months had elapsed since the date on which the incident occurred, I did not intend to make further official representations. I had noted with satisfaction the fact that, at the time when the Iraqi Government initiated their present campaign against smuggling between Kuwait and Iraq, the Prime Minister had assured Mr. Bateman that strict orders had been given that there should be no further incur sions into Kuwaiti territory. I was hopeful, therefore, that the incident alleged to have occurred on July 9th was last of its kind. I should, however, be glad to receive Hon'ble an Lieutenant-Colonel T.G.V/. Powle, 0. B.

The ohaikh, I fear, reacted rather badly to your suggestion, and pointed out, that to place a boat of his flying the Kuwait flag and contaiing some of his 'fidawis* (men corresponding to rolice) merely as an 'observing party' would do no good at all as far as be could see and would only be a useless expense. For it was quite certain that whatever the occupants of the boat reported, the Iraq authorities would, as they have always done hitherto, give a point blank denial to the story, and say that it ,;as an invention on the part of biased officials, who themselves were interested in smuggling. 4. The Shaikh asked me to remind you that in the following incidents which had taken place in the past it was either Kuwait paid officials, or ^tate fidawis, who had seen and reported the activities of the Fao Customs launch, yet their reports had been dismissed as invent!ojte A lies by the Iraq Grovemment, so he saw no reason to suppose that they (the Iraq authorities) would take up any other attitude The Hon f ble Lt.-Colonel T.C .J 'owle, G.B.L., ^ Political Resident in the Persian Grulf, BTteHIH4.

It is revealed to the Iraqi Government that 'men of the Kuwait Principality' (? Kuwaiti Government officials) have been accompanying, and acting escort to, smuggling caravans; cooperating with smugglers in offering resistence to Iraqi forces within Iraqi territory; employing thei r camels in the carriage of smuggled goods; and selling in Iraq arms bearing the mark of the Shaikh of Kuwait, besides other varieties of arms the smuggling of which into Iraq has been on the increase. The following are instances of these activities : 1. On 11th December, 1935, at 9 p.m. the Police Force, then at Shariat Hashim Zayid, 1 e aring the noise of camels fired a Verey light to ascertain the fact, whereupon the force was suddenly received by a smuggling caravan with volleys of fire from both front and rear. In the engagement which followed the smugglers were forced to escape. However, in the morning of 12th December, 1935, the Assistant Commandant of the Police Armed Cars, while doing patrol work at A1 Ibtain and A1 ! Idhaibi came across a party of these smugglers whom he arrested after having admitted their Suilt. The party consisted of 20 persons and had with them 55 camels and a quantity of smuggled goods. Of these 20 persons, 8 were 'Fidaiyah' (armed retainers) of the Shaikh of Kuwait. 2* On another occasion the Iraqi authorities found with ! Ayid ibn Slaihim, Salih ibn Saif and Hamad ibn ^wadh Ali, (of the ^idaiyah of the Shaikh of Kuwait) two English rifles Nos. 543 and 12794, and one Turkish 'Martin' rifle, all of which bore the mark 0 f the Shaikh of Kuwait* 3eII y l/J^ PL Lsf- 2 # f fhe Iraqi authorities seized, at a place called 'Al Ratkah A1 Shimaliyah' smuggled goods and a number of camels '^h4rCte^twd--sfe€--c8^e^&amp; the mark of Bartham A1 ba'bah# There are numerous smuggling incidents to which I have not referred, contenting myself with the above three as 'being typical cases affording proof of the complicity of employees of the Kuwait authorities. I, therefore, trust that Your Excellency will 'be so good as to use your kind offices with a view to effective measures 'being adopted to put an end to this state of affairs, and will inform me of the resulf of the efforts exerted in this connection. I avail myself of this opportunity to express to you. Monsieur l 1 Ambassadeur, my highest consideration and esteem. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Yasin A1 Hashimi.

It contained some policemen, and was seen by mm*** &gt; &lt; i * ** ngrjr**. the reporter stationary off the motor road to the ./est. After a few minutes it moved in an Eastward direction. As such patrolling is against what has been decided and contrary to friendly and .^ood relations, it has displeased us; moreover we are afraid that such wandering may give rise to an affair that will give displeasure to all. Therefore, I request that you will kindly regard this question with a careful eye, so that such an incident may not recur.

I attach a reply from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait to my enquiry, 2 # I would point out that the first case occurred on the 11th or l&amp;th of December 19 55 and the complaint of the Iraq Government is dated the 16th of March 1936 that is after a lapse of three months. The other comrosnts made in your letter referred to above are exactly what jumps to mind here^-fi* what puzzles His Excellency is that so serious an allegation, tantamount to a personal attack upon him, should be made with so little apparent attempt at investigation or supported evidence; and this inspite of what must seem a marked absence of expedition in bringing the case to notice# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. 'Capt a in, Political Agent, Kuwait.Translation of a letter No.R/5/43, dated the^lst Safar 1355, corresponding to the 2End April 1936, frcta his 'Rhf ftp.i 1 ftncy t tie Huler of Kuwait to tiie i^oli ical Agent, After Compliments, I have witli pleasure received your letter No.C-136 dated 20th April 1956, including a translation of a note from the Iraqi Ministry of foreign Affairs* I have considered the contents of the note, which are very regrettable because of the Ministry's having ascribed that our forces accompany the smugglers and cooperated with them in offering resistance to the Iraqi forces in the Iraqi territory. The Ministry further says that a party of smugglers were arrested, ei^it of whom were armed Fidawis of ours. Also that the Iraqi authorities arrested 'Ayidh bin Sulaihim, Salih bin Saif and Haifid bin 'Awadh Ali and found with them 2 English rifles and 2 'Martin' Turkish rifles, all bearing our mark; and that G they seized seme smuggled goods at a place named 'al Raqah a^li Tr' ~ '' ' ' * ■ al Shamaliey', with a number of camels, among which there were two she- camels bearing the mark of ' , al-_irtham'» 2 We, however, to the contrary of their opinion, are very anxious to maintain the privileges of neighbourhood with sincerity and friendship. It is not correct that we assist those who intend aauggling, or provide them with armed forces against our Iraqi brethren. God forbid that we should do so, I assure you that these allegations are not correct, for our Fidawis are known and well controlled. Their names are known well, and they have a chief at their head, appointed to observe all their movements. The tribal chiefs of Iraq also know them » very well. It is impossible that anyone of them makes the least movement in the direction of such things. ^ As for the Fidawis whom the Hinistry have mentioned in their note, they are entirely unknown to us, nor they are In cur service. The authorities may depute somebody on- 2 - somebody on whom they rely, to the place viiere the above Fidawis are impriaonecl, in order to take their statements one by one, and ask them to swear If they are from our servants the Fidawiyeh* As for the question of the firearms and the camels, that the Iraqi forces found four rifles and two she-camels and have seen on them the mark of 'Al-Birtham', this is not improbable, as many of our camels and firearms fell to the hands of various tribesmen during the raids of Xkhwan. This is not an evidence for what has been ascribed by the intriguers and instigators inho asserted that we assist those intend smuggling with an armed force against our Iraqi breth ren. God forbid that we should agree to such action.It can never be said that our forces crossed the Iraqi frentier or did something wrong in the Iraqi territory.On the contrary we always do our best to maintain peace and tranquility between the two brother countries,which is our utmost desire in every way. i The Ministry also says that there are other kinds of firearms which are being smuggled into Iraq.To this I say that there is no factory for firearms in Kuwait .Moreover, the trade of firearms has since long been prohibited, and there is now nothing worthy of note of the firearms in Kuwait• t On several occasions I informed you of the trans gressions of the Iraqi force quartered at Safwan.This force is still wandering in Kuwaiti territoiy and inspecting the tribesmen of Kuwait. I here repeat my request for your kind representations to the authorities ocuoerned with a view to preventing the said transgressions. If this continues as at present, and consequently an event which affects peace takes place, it will no aoubt be alleged a designed occur rence.But our hope in God and our Iraqi brethren is fair, and Insballah nothing will happen which will disturb tiie friendiy ^^existlng between both countries.

I am in entire agreement with the opinions expressed in paragraph S of Captain de Gaury's letter, which coincide wit.i those expressed in my Express Letter quoted a'ove. 2. With regard to case 1, the Shaikh, as loir Hzcei enc„, will see, flatly denies the allegation of the Iraq Government that of the party of smugglers arrested, eight were armed Fidawis of his. If the individuals were in fact Fidawis of the Shaikh, it is inexplicable to me why the Iraq Government did not at tne time of their arrest report the matter immediately to Your Excellency for communication, through me, to the Shaikh, when proper investigation could have been carried out, instead of waiting 3 months before submitting their complaint, and even then failing to give tne names of the alleged Fidawis.-g- \0 Z* With regard to case 2, no date of the occurrence is given, and the Shaikh denies that the two individuals named are his Fidawis. At the end of paragraph 3 of his letter the Shaikh makes the sensible suggestion that the al leged Fidav;is, (who are presumably in prison), should be interrogated as to whether they are in reality his Fidawis or not. 4. With regard to the f. camels mentioned in case 2 and the 3 rifles mentioned in case 2, alleged by the Iraq authorities to beer the mark of the Shaikh, the latter (vide paragraph 4 of his letter) 'states that this is not improbable, since many of his camel! and rifles fell into the hands of various tribesmen during the Akhwan raids. 5 # fTaking the Iraq accusations as a whole personally I am left (subject* to any further evidence tae Iraq authorities can produceV with the unfortunate impression that the Iraq Govern ment have concocted their extremely vague, unsubstantiated anc unconvincing complaint as a counter to the mariy representations which have been made to them with regard to trie incursions into Kuwait territory and territorial waters, and outrages commit'ed there, by their Customs and Police officials, 6.

In other words we should soon see it taking shape, whatever it might be at first called, as an Iraqi Police Court dealing with all border cases (if not actually sentencing those it found guilty). soon as this Court was heard about lots of men with old or new grievances of the kind so conmon with the nomad and half-nomad - the ^stealing by finding^ of cattle, and so on - would bring their cases up on the Iraqi The Hon T ble Lt .-Colone1 T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I RE .2 - 17} Iraqi side of the frontier. We should I think find the Court's activities increasing also because ^argon is one of those officials whom the Iraq G-overnment retain to please the British Grovemment, hut taking care that he should have as little as possible to do with the Police administration and naturally pining for a more interesting vV fkA full time job. y (Incidentally I notice in Baghdad telegram ^o.^il of the 9th May (vide your P.L.^67-S of 12.5.S6) the report of ^recent increase in smuggling' although no reports have come through). e&gt; ong W ay and another therefore I don't think much of this idea and it is, I thinl:;, a most unusual one. The frontier officials of both sides of some other frontiers meet periodically to settle outstanding oases, uaially somemhef on the frontier, Syria-Iraq for example - and that would be a more reasonable, if probably unnecessary, suggest ion. ** /teuA ?■ v? b 0 7 .Vo. 109/5/36. f yb\) HIS Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad presents his compliments to the Honourable the Political Resident and has the honour to transmit to him the unde^lu^^i(^^^io^uInen^ , Embassy.,.

My dear Oaorg# r ^ * Your letter (K 1979/5V91) of the S8nd of Ap:-il about Kowoit.

Ya asjji aa ja, that the continuanoe of aam^glin^y especially of arm nnd asounition, fro.t o ait was emu tri&lt;r much -itttjr feeling in this oountpy^ particularly at the present time, whon it vr \ b felt that the inaurgenta on the Ku&lt;phrates ware probably uaing- rifles obtained in this way, he iraqi Oovermaent were alao seriously annoyed at hawing to maintain a large and costly preventive service on the Itmu and sea frontiers of o -ait in ore ar tc try to check thle Bro^-llnr- 'hey felt Btrongly that the hsikh wna not behaving in a decent neighbourly manner and so long HKHiSiL, SSJij,, C.K.G.- 8- as he failed to disoliarge -what they considered to be his proper obligations as the ruler of a neighbouring country, they were unlikely to consider sympathetioally any proposal concerning his date gardens at Fao or asra. / I said that I was unhappy about the existing bad relations between the two countries and was aoist anxious to bring about a sett lament of the outstanding questions to which they were due. Apart froa the question of the date gardens, about which X could not speak in detail until I received the Foreign Office 's reply to the proposals which I had siade concerning them, there was another matter which 1 felt was one of the root causes of the present trouble. This was the fear that existed in Kuwait that Iraq intended to absorb the principality. If this could be removed I wao sure that the atmosphere would greatly improve. Yaaain said that although Iraqis interested in Arab unity frequently talked about the welding together of all the Arab peoples and countries, the annexation of I u^ait had never teen anrl tus not now part of the practical polley of the Iraqi Governraent. They -ranted to be friends with the ihaikh and his people and had no calculated de signs on the Shaikh 1 s independence. They did, however, feel very strongly that the ^liaikh, by allowing (if not^ 5 - anooupa^lng) hie peopi© to carry on aauggling into Iraq on a vary larg 5 © scale, was acting in an imn«i^hboiu»ly aad jiiupi i nil in - ! almost v ^i&lt;sndly manner, and the feeling that he wa» u nuisance certainly stlnailated private Ideas about the annexation of KvMit as a aeans to putting a stop to the serious eiLbarraseiaente which the aamggling caused. I said that I fuller appreciated the annoyance of the Iraqi Govenruaent, but at trio aaiae tim I also realised how difficult it was for the shaikh effectively to inter vene. AO^eit lived largely on its entrepot trade, and if heavy reetrictions were iuposed on this trade, iaany of the Kttweiti nereaan^a would oe ruine i. . osa^ 1^ , ir •• j ; 'iudl blockade were raised, the sitxxaticn would laprove* That was a matter already render discussion with the Covernment of &gt;eudl Arabia. As regards the aauggling of arms, I said that I should be glad to receive details of any positive instances which had come to light. His kajesty 's ' ov^rnutent, who had tiieniaelves been obliged to do so much to stop the smuggling of arms from the Gulf into India, would certainly understand the isaportance of this matter and it might well be easier to devise effective aeasures to stop illicit&lt;2) ~ 4 &lt;• traffic in arms than to prevent smuggling in tea, watches, sxi^ar and 3© on. ?he Prime Ifinieter thaniced tm and said that he wouXd give instructions for the facto to be clarified in a ispecial report. He remarked, howeTor* that ae the ^erc passed on tiii'ough the trioes, it was very difficult to establish proof. Xnoidentally, there have been of late one or two vor/ foolish articles about itawait in a piffling little Iraqi newspaper called Al /.arkh - ''.Extract from Local Press dated 11th May, 1956, j&amp;i? Karkh . The English Dlasatlafled with the /ydnlni strati on la Kuwait. Rumours were current of late to the effect that difference bad arisen 'between the mir of Kuwait and the British Resident in the Persian Oulf, and that the difference was referred to the British Government, who are said to have expressed their deep regret at the backward nature of the administration in Kuwait. It is wellknown that the general administration in Kuwait, where adnaini strati on in the recognised sense of the term hardly exists at all and government is of the antique Shaikh rule type, ie not in any way satisfactory to the British. Their dissatisfaction with the administration in Kuwait may perhaps induce the British to change the regime and deliver the inhabitants of Kuwait from their present condition, v/hen our government will, as we hope, take a part in the improvement and organisation of the administration there. We cherish for our brethren of Kuwait the loyal feelings cherished by brother for brother; and we regret more deeply than the British regret the deterioration of conditions in that principality. The energy of our zealous men may perhaps find for the inhabitants of Kuwait an outlet from their present condition. x x Xjd- Extract from Local Press dated 18th May, 1936. • • • • * Karkl». x xx Sfflugglln^ from Kuwait # In a front page article under the above heading discussing the continued activities of smugglers operating from Kuwait not withstanding the strong preventive measures adopted 'by the Ipaql Government the editor writes : 'One may not 'be 'blamed for suspecting that smugglers are receiving continuous financial aid from some quarter intending 111 by Iraq and its trade Interests, for no matter how great the profits of smuggling may 'be the smuggler is doomed to lose the very last fils in his possession once he is caught 'by the police and his goods confiscated.' proceeding the editor suggests that the preventive and repressive measures hitherto adopted 'by the Iraqi Government arc not adequate for the suppression of smuggling from Kuwait and that a strike should 'be delivered at the very root of the evil. He writes : 'In our opinion the most successful method would 'be for the Iraqi Government to act for the striking of the name of Kuwait off the list of Aral) principalities and try to annex Kuwait to Iraq. Ciroimstances appear to 'be favouraible for the successful realisation of this idea, particularly so in view of the fact that the Kuwait administration is now known to 'be held with detestation by the Kngllsh who are likely to agree to the idea of annexing Kuwait to Iraq.

From Captain G.S.de Gaury, M.C., Politioal Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Kuwait-Iraq Incidents. Sir, I have the honour to make certain observations on the existing relations between Iraq and Kuwait, taking as an opportune occasion the reception ol a copy o- ixis ^ k V * Excellency the imibassador* s letter of the 20th i^ay P No.100/12/36 to Mr.Hendel at the .'oreign Crfioe. 2 # Referrii^ to the alleged smuggling I note that the Prime Minister of Iraq said (page 3 of the letter) that aauggling was going on ''on a very l£ rge • 3 If this is so I take it that the i-raq u-overnmen - would have no difficulty in proving it? Could they be asked to do so giving all relevant details including the names and particulars (tribe or place of domicile; of all Kuwaitis now in prison in Iraq for smuggling, when imprisoned and what quantities of snuggled goods were found with them? Ve should have saae idea then how we stand. His Bxcellenoy the Ambassador I see in replying said that Kuwait 'lived largely on its entrepot trade'. This I think from some recent and careful enquires is a slight misunderstanding as the order in importance ofKuwait's means of livelihood is now pearling, closely followed by the carrying trade in the Indian Ocean the Hed Sea and along the African Coast, some way behind boat-building and only fourthly ordinary trade. Of entrepot trade in the usual sense of the word there is today none or only a quiteno quite negligible quantity. (V/jbien before the iar the entrepot trade was greater it may have held third place, the trade with the interior being mostly directed to Hk.IL, the then Capital of the Eashids aM the towns of in Nejd and not with Iraq)• 5 # In the latter connection I would point out what may K be now and then cverlooed, that there is still a fairly a extensive trade with the Bedouin who come to Kuwait annually. They slowly, in a matter of months, move towards Kuwait and its better grazing areas and as slowly move their tents by stages away again* Most of them later i.e. in the Spring or early Summer recross the Saudi Arab frontier, or the Iraqi, and pay in those countries in about three years out of four their taxes. On arrival and, as may be needed during their stay and before moving off they restock. 6. &gt; This restocking (MUSABIL a ) is not now, by Ibn Saud anyway, called smuggling. 7. Most of the Iraqi tribesmen abovementioned, Shammar and Muntafiq, return each Hay to Iraq. This may account for the 'recent increased smuggling'. The best way to stop this, if the Iraq Grovernment wish to do so, would be for them to control their tribes and prevent them ever coming into Kuwait. 3 # Kuwait would lose some trade but it could not be helped and she could have no grievance at Iraq keeping Iraqi tribes inside her frontiers. Once they are here it is inhuman and impracticable to prevent selling to them. Apart from this I find it difficult to believe that there is mu^ch smuggling any longer. 9^ The 'large and costly' (vis a vis Kuwait may not this be rather an exaggeration?) preventive service of Iraq has had its effect. I have made numerous enquiries frcci many different sources (including the late Director of Customs who dismissed from the Shaikh's service is inclinedjCjl inclined to a critical attitude) and always receive the same answer that smuggling has now very much decreased. It is most unlikely in view of the freedom with which I move and speak with people here that a deliberate conspiracy of silence could be kept up and I believe that it is true that smuggling other than 'Llusabila* - if that is so called - is now as near negligible as smuggling may be, or in any case is certainly not largely increasing. His Excellency the Ruler however thinks that there may still be some in tea, sugar and Iraqi cigarettes. The latter it seems have a light export tax but a heavier internal tax. 10. These articles it is thought are smuggled mostly by the Shewiya or donkey sections of the iiuntafiq tribe (Iraq) perhaps moving East of the Zubair road and probably crossing the frontier roundabout Umm 4asr. They seek cover as it were from the sections of their tribe camped here. 11» ;/ith regard to the 'continuance of smuggling, especially of arms and amriiunition M it is noted that His Excellency said that he would be glad to receive details of any positive instances which had come to light and that the Prim© Minister replied that w as the arms were passed on through the tribes it was very difficult to establish proof'. |f\ * 12. I take it from the Prime Minister's two remarks read together that he has abandoned the allegation made in the Iraq Foreign Office letter to the iimbassador No.C/754, dated the 16th Ivlarch 1936 that the Shaikh is himself running caravans, or that anyone i s, as caravans are catchable and evidence, but that rifles are passing in ones and twos but constantly from hand to hand across the frontier from out of Kuwait. 13 # If this is so the suggestion, which the Prime Minister admits it is difficult to prove, may be examinedft-y examined on the general evidence available. 14. it is from this, I think, most likely to have been true for rifles in iirabia are known to pass from hand to hand like shares in the European markets and are regarded more or less in the same light. 15. -iThenever there is a demand, as at the present moment on the Middle Euphrates, there is certain to be a drift of weapons in that direction as the Prime Minister must know. 16. But the number, other things being equal, coming in from Kuwait would necessarily be smaller than from bigger countries with longer frontiers adjoining Iraq, such as Saudi Arabia, Syria and perhaps Persia. Other things however are not equal. The entry of arms into Kuwait is under strict supervision^ His Excellency the Huler himself cannot import a shot gun without permission from the Political iLgent. The Persian Gulf sloops also make it a practice to examine dhows at sea and have not found arms hereabouts or destined for Kuwait. 17» Information too is good and numbers of ri 'les could not be landed without ie being known. On the other hand in neighbouring country large stocks are frequently landed, as may be seen for example from the official British reports from Jedda and the Monarch customarily gives to visiting Shaikhs presents of arms which sooner or later go into general circulation, (inspite of arms carrying regulations). 18, Thus it is reasonable to suppose that the proportion of arms going in from Kuwait would, by comparison or any standard, be very small indeed. 19, Local information here is that fairly large numbers do go into Iraq by other frontiers when there is a demand. The wells of UI^I AR RADHIM^A south west of the Iraq Neutral Zone are always mentioned as being on the smugglers route, the smugglers being individuals (not Shaikhs or whole sectiom)- 5 - if) but veiy frequently of the ShaiDmar or Lhafir tribes. 20. I should also expect arms to be going through to Iraq, when there is a demand, from the direction of JAUF to the Wadian district; where the Anaza are in this exceptional summer still camped; and from the North through the V/adi al Miya and the Qara depression. 21. The experts of the Bureau des Renseignments in Syria and our frontier service in Transjordan would I have no doubt confirm the fact that arms do drift ac^s^ those frontiers when there is a demand, if asked. 22. If this is so it seems rather unfair to stigmatize Kuwait for her mite. 23. Since my return from Baghdad on the 30th May His Excellency the Ruler has in any case issued the strictest orders to the Emir of Jahra to watch for the passing of even single arms in the direction of Iraq. 24. Leaving aside the past, as I understand His iiixcellency the embassador wishes to do, and taking the existing time and conditions it would appear from general evidence, from local information here, and in the absence of proof to the contrary from Iraq that there is now no smuggling except in the smallest quantity from Kuwait to Iraq. It does however seem evident that the Iraqi Government is stigmatizing Kuwait. 25. I take this opportunity of giving below summary of past frontier incidents with the subsequent results in each case.

If Iraqi Police and Customs officials got into trouble for crossing the frontier I feel equally sure that they would not do so.

There is however a certain fear that persistent Iraqi misrepresentation and incorrect infonnation might mislead British Oovernment departments and officials• 3. .also while Kuwait is under British protection it would seem unnecessary to admit to a neighbouring power that there is fear by the inhabitants of a country un der 3ri ti sh protection that their country may be annexed by that power. To do so and without reference to Britain's protection or attitude in such an event, would seem almost to suggest that we and the Kuwaitis accept it is a possible contingency and, if she has any desire that way, be encouraging to that power. 4. It would do no harm if the Iraq Government were very clearly informed that they are not being so encouraged? Unless some such action is taken I expect increased transgressions of the frontier by Iraq and Iraqi representa tions as a result almost immediately. For the Iraqi Govern ment disregarding or misjudging the effect on Kuwait and Arabia and theJ^~ very different racial characteristics of the inhabitants and economic interests, may now believe that tired of constant complaint the British Government would The Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Kuwait.mSmm —' 2 •' ?-e.V \ would abarxLon her protection of Kuwait in favour of Iraq and that she h£.s on^.y to continue to complain# In any case it appears that the 'bad relations' between Kuwait and ^raq are in fact very much on one side nowadays• v rfT f /% Telsgram G # T,C.

Shaikh's request seems to me reasonable. V/ith regard to (a) frontier incidents are invariably investigated by a mixed commission representing both Governments concerned and with regard to (b) I think it would certainly be preferable for investigation to be widened and not limited to one case onli, and that by no means the worst.

V Idea of investigation by a British subject (^who has only limited period in which to act) was to enable complaints to be examined prima facie and impartially so as to obviate necessity for a full blown enquiry by a Frontier Commission. I think Shaikh 1 s present proposals would so complicate question that Iraq Government would withdraw from position to which I have with difficulty brought them or worse still if Shaikh insists on going so far into the past Iraq Government might well wish to broaden basis of enquiry so as to include smuggling incidents which have involved deaths and injury to Iraq police not to mention finaiicial loss. I have so far headed them off this and have succeeded in getting them to confine enquiry to Shaikh* s latest complaints as regards which he might reasonably be expected to have witnesses near at hand. Investigation machinery thus set up holds out hope of better things in future and affords a means of enquiry into incidents as and when they occur. This is what is urgently required. If Shaikh now insists upon his present proposals my efforts will be rendered nugatory and hope persuading / ' WijfftMMl -2- persuading Iraq Government to regard Shaikh 1 s complaints seriously will be much diminished. I hope therefore that you may be able to persuade him to drop them.

Dated 17th received 20th July 1956. Your telegrams 174 and 177• His Majesty's Government are most disappointed at Iraqi desire to liiut up new proposals with smuggling question since their experience is that pogress in solving difficult problems is generally fr ced by isolating them as far as possible and dealing with each on merits. Object of new proposals was to achieve fair and lasting settlement of land problem continuance of which is naraful to Iraqi relations with His Majesty's Govern ment as well as with Ku/ait and to gain this His Majesty's Government were prepared to make considerable concessions to Iraqi point of view. 6ee paragraph 6 of my despatch b59. Polity of His Majesty's Government is to remove all sources of disagreement between themselves ana Iraqi Government ami successful settlement of Railway question encouraged by belief that a^r Iraqi Government were of same mind. His Majes y's Government cannot in any case ac.mit Iraq contention that application of land settlement to Shaikha lands constituted purely concession towards 8haikh by Iraq Government which requires payment in another sphere. Preoccupation of land settlement organisation vith other districts was always appreciated here (see paragraph 11 of my despatch &amp;59) but it was hoped that Iraqi Government would/wouXci spontaneously realise advantage to themaelves of disposing of this question# in any case lena settlement would presumably be applied in the lon^ run districts in which Ih&amp;ikh 1 s lane s are situated. Please take early opportunity of spea ing to Iraqi Minister for Foreign ^'f^irs (and if possible to Prime Minister as v /ell) in the above sense and urge them strongly not to throw away present opprtunity of settling date gardens problem by cragging in highly contentious snug, ling question. SECKCiTARY Oi' tT Tii FOB FOhEIGN Amm i f: 1. illCONFIDENTIAL , From No.C/8J£ of 1356, Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, BAHRAIN« Dated the 20th July, 19£6 # lie The Hon f ble Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, The India Office, London* Sir, fo/i' i have the honpur to refer to correspondence ending with ay Printed Letter No«581-S, dated the 10th July 19o6, forwarding furtner details of an old complaint by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Babah, Kuler of Kuwait, of an outrage on the part of the Iraq Customs officials. 8. In my letter No#C/5 of the 16th January 19^6 to Lis Excellency The Ambassador, Bagdad, (copy forwarded to Incia Office, Government of Inaia and Political Agent, Kuwait, unaer my Printed Letter Ko.C/6 of same date), while forwarding a complaint from the Shaikh of an outrage on the part of Iraq Customs officials, i reviewed the whole matter of Kuwait-Iraq incidents up to that date and in paragraph 7 suggested a certain course of action. 2. i have received no reply to this suggestion, and tne events dealt with in correspondence ending with Bagoad telegrami dated the SSrd June 1936, copy formrded to India Office, Government of India and Political Agent, Kuwait, uncer my sf&gt;-2 Printed Letter No#0/80 of the gbrd June 1936, have given me an idea that it may be possible to deal with this question in another method on the lines suggested in my telegram No.T/58 of/V''-L a- 7 -s- of the 17th June 1926 to His Excellency The Aabassador, Bagdad, copy forwarded by air sail to India Office antl Government of India under ay Printed letter No.C/63 of the 17th June 1336. It seems to me that a mixed commission, representing both the Shaikh and th« Iraq Government authorised to investigate all the frontier incidents by land and sea which have occurred between the two States, would be cie best way of wiping the slate clean between the two parties. Since the foreign relations of tae Shaikh are in tue uanos of i;is Majesty's Government, the Shaikh would be represented by the Political Agent, and the Iraq Government by the Mutasssvix f Basra or any other official they chose to appoint. Each party would, if the decision of both representatives were unanimous, bind themselves to accept tae decision as final. Ihe commission might well meet at Eafwan, which is on the Kuwait- Iraq frontier. 4, The commission would be authorised to examine all Incidents which have occurred since April 19Sc (see paragrapn J) E (1) of my letter No.l098-B of the e7th November 1^34, copy forwarded to the India Office, Government of Incia and Political Agent, Kuwait, under my Printed letter No.l09S-S of same date). Ho IncidentstD the best of my knowledge have occurred previous to that date. Doubtless when they came to examine these cases the commission would find tlat £ m had occurred too long ago for an enquiry to be practicable. An award by the commission to this effect would be a final decision on such incidents. For the rest the commission would decide (a) who was to blt.iae and (b) what compensaxion, if any, was to be paid by the offending party! i.e. the Shaikh, of Kuwait or the Iraq Governnent. With regard to the last /-3- % ,-ai last paragraph of Ambassador Bagdad's telegram No # 86 of 19th April 1936 to the Foreign Office. The Iraq Government would of course put forward their claims as well as the Shaikh, and any compensation awarded to them would be a set-off against compensation awarded to the Shaikh# /• .«3 5. With reference to His Excellency the Ambassador's suggestion (vide his telegram No.9 of 15th June 19556 to the /^7 Political Agent, Kuwait, and first paragraph of his telegram dated the 18th June 19S6 to me, copies forwarded to the India Office and Government of India under ay Printed letters Hos. r-M j J.rtl C/61 of 16th June and C/71 of 80th June 1956) that a British Police Officer in the employ of the Iraq Governmont should conduct the enquiry# The difficulty in this suggestion is that the Shaikh does not concur in His Excellency*s opinion that an enquiry by an Iraqi Police Officer, even though British, into the alleged misdeeds of Iraqi Customs and Police Officials, would be impartial# I am sorry to have to say so, but I entirely agree with tiie Shaikh! though I &lt;£fd not tell him so# My own experience as Resident for the last four years of the attitude of British Officers in the Iraqi Customs and Police Departments gives me the distinct impression that - as far as Kuwait is concerned - they are far from impartial# They seem to me indeed to be more Iraqi than the Iraqis, and if any Kuwait-Iraq question had to be decided by a single Official in Iraqi employ, I am inclined to think tnat the Shaikh would get a squarer deal from an Iraqi, than from a British Official in the Iraqi Departments mentioned# 6# If the commission, as suggested by me, were unanimous in their award on any incident, well and good# If however they /*»&amp;■» they differed, then the qaestion of &amp;n arbitrator arises. It would be distinctly preferable that this arbitrator should be unconnected with Xrac^ or Kuwait# I cannot, however, tuink of any such arbitrator and failing such I think that Judge Lloyd might be appointed. As far as I can Judge from the personal impression he made on me, and from what I xave heard, I do not thinlt that he is possessed by the same anti-Kuwait prejudices as his British colleagues in the Police and Customs Departments. Moreover he is a Jud^e and presumably therefore has certain qualities of impartiality. 7. I do not think that the Iraq Government could object to the proposal of such a mixed commission since it is the normal international procedure for settling frontier incident? and since there is, I understand, a similar procedure for settling such incidents between Iraq and Turkey and Iraq and Syria. I do not know what the Shaikh 1 s reaction would be but I think it might be favourable, and if His Majesty's Government agree to the proposal the Political Agant, Kuwait, can approach him on the subject. 8. Should the commission prove a success in dealing with past cases, it might with advantage be made permanent and deal with all future cases as t.iey come up. 9.

G. were in a stronger position than nov; to enforce their demands) to assume any responsibility for implementing promises made by H.M.G. in 1914. (b) They maintain refusal now and only way to reverse it would be to bring them to arbitration which would be inadvisable, even if possible. (c) Iraqi Government stand to gain little by adopting our Land Settlement proposals, in comparison with gain to H.M.G (who get a troublesome matter off their hands) and to Shaikhs who henceforth enjoy undisputed possession of their properties and freedom from direct Iraqi taxation - a privileged position which is hardly merited by the way in which some of the properties were acquired and only arises from promises made by h.M.G. 2 # paragraphs 2 and 3 of J ^ushire telegram appear to i be a mis reading of the facts because: (a) mtevention of H.M.G. is no less neoessary to secure Shaikh's privileged position to bring about some arrangement to combat smuggling. (b) In view of 1 above the desire of the iraqi Government to extract some benefit in return for concessions to H.M.G I n and Shaikhs can hardly be said to be unwarrantable. ^c) Owing to relatively settled conditions in the i^asra district, this Liwa would in the ordinary course be the las to which Land Settlement procedure would be applied many y f I years/ '7 I -2- yeara hence, we are asking Iraqi Government to suit our purpose by diverting one of their two ^not four) British Land Settlement officers together with trained staff for man- months from settlement of problems which have a political and economic argency. P.M. and M.F.A. profess in-ability to face criticism to which they will lay themselves open by recommending this course. J-hey feel that in present unst; unstable position of the Government they must have a quid pit, position of Minister quo in order to withstand &amp;jfodof interior. necessity for rapid settlement le.f. paragraph 6 of Bushire telegram) arises from facts that H.MG. are not on strong ground in refusing indefinitely to serve legal documents on 5haikh of Kuwait in connection with pending cases and the longer settlement is delayed the more opport unity occurs to break TAsarruf which would be a serious mat matter for the ohaikhs. Time is of importance for H.M.G. and the Shaikh but not to the iraqi Government, (e) Co-operation of Shaikh in regard to Land Settleaent (paragraph 5 of Bushire telegram) is only necessary in so fa: as he needs to prove his titles. x f he does not co-operate he runs risk of losing part of his property with small chances of redress. 4. H.F.A. is willing to put our proposals to Gouncil of Ministers as soon as they begin know whether and if so to what extent Shaikh of Kuwait is prepared to give effect t was smuggling proposals of last year which he/alone in refusing against the strong advice of H.M.G.• 1 have persuaded M.5*.A. not to regard these proposals as divinely inspired and to allowiihaikh some latitude.
