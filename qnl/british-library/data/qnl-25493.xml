No. 199, dated Maskat, the 22nd August 1914. From— Lieutenant-Colonel R. A. E. Benn, C.I.E., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report the following incident for your information. 2. On the morning of the 16th August, the Officer Commanding Bait al Palaj reported by telegram that the regimental dhobi’s son had been snot dead and a Lance Naik of the regiment wounded by a party of “ budmashes ” in the hills to the north-west of one of the outlying picquecs at Bait al Falaj. As soon as the news reached Headquarters, the troops were turned out to scour the hills with, however, no result. 3. The following is an abreviated account of the affair as given by the Officer Commanding Troops :— The non-commissioned officer of No. 1 Picquet had seen a boat land some men on the beach within sight of their post. He despatched a Lance Naik and two men to ascertain who they were. They proved to be harmless people, who had come to get stone from a quarry hard by. The dhobi’s son had preceded the party to the beach for the purpose of collecting shells. He returned with the Lance Naik. Elsewhere in the vicinity the headman of the Wathaiya village (3 miles from Bait al Falaj) was out grazing his camels. He saw in the distance what he considered to be a party of “ budmashes ” and as the neighbourhood is a favourite haunt of thieves and several instances of camel stealing having occurred, the headman proceeded to fire on the “ budmashes” at long range. The “ budmashes ” not seeing where the firing had come from, promptly returned it aiming at the nearest object they could see moving in their vicinity. This happened to be the Lance Naik and the dhobi’s son who were about 400 yards distant. The dhobi’s son was hit in the thigh and his femoral artery was severed. He died almost at once. The Lance Naik was wounded in the wrist, but was able to let off one round after which his magazine jammed with his blood. The “budmashes” are said to have disappeared into the hills in the direction of the Kurram village. No trace of them was found in the neighbourhood, though a search was made for several hours by the troops. The Officer Commanding attaches no blame to the Wathaiya people. 4. This incident occurring at a moment when strong rumours are current locally of the rebels’ intention to renew their hostilities on Maskat and Matrah after the Id at once gave colour to the above reports and some local excite ment resulted in the town. 5. As a result of enquiries which His Highness has made, it seems that the “budmashes” were a portion of a gang of Bani Battash who hive recei tly been harassing the neighbourhood of Karyat. They direct their operations from the village of Hail to the south-west of Karyat and have already killed four Baluchis of the Karyat village. Their practice is to snipe at anv one they see on the outskirts ol the village. British subjects have been ret used permission to return to Karyat which place they vacated before the bombard- Hartmouth” in April last. India, Foreign- Secretary's No 36 M, dated 3 SEP 1914 ment or the town by H. M. S. “ /a { 25- rVHis Highness has informed me that his information shows that a party of Bani Battash recently left Hail for the Wadi Hatat. From there they detached a smaller party to the hills round Wathaiya with instructions to loot camels and snipe at any “ friends of the Sultan His Highness thinks that the '* budmashes ' who fired on the Lance Naik and killed the dhobi’s son were members of this gang. He also informs me that he has heard that it is the intention of Bani Battash to harass the Bait al Falaj post after the Id and that their attention will then be specially directed to the Ruwi post. The Officer Commanding at Bait al Falaj has been warned and has made his arrangements accordingly. 6. A copy of this report is being posted to the Hon’ble the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department.India Oitice, London, 13th February 1914. Secret, No. 6. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. In continuation of ray telegram dated the 17th January 1914, authorising Muscat.Renewal of Sultan's tlle rellewal of the subsidies payable to subsidies. Views of Foreign Office the Sultan of Muscat, I enclose for on question of establishment of a the consideration of Your Excellency’s Government. 2. As will he seen, the Foreign Office has no objection, from an inter national point of view, to the creation of a Levy Corps on the basis proposed by the Resident in the Persian Gulf in his telegram No. 15 M, of the 14th October 1913, provided that the Corps is nominally a Muscat force, and that the officers by whom it is commanded, whether British or Indian, are nominally in the Sultan’s service. 3. I understand that the primary object of the proposed Levy Corps is to enable you to withdraw the Indian troops at present garrisoning the towns of Muscat and Muttreh, and to place at the nominal disposition of the Sultan a locally raised force sufficient to assert his authority, defend his capital against rebellious tribesmen, and furnish a reserve from which detachments may be drawn to garrison such of His Highness’s inland forts as he may hereafter recover. The relief to your revenues would be substantial, even if a part of the cost of the corps were borne by you, and for this reason the scheme is attractive. But unless it is carefully handled it is not free from risk. If the corps should be imposed upon the Sultan against his will, and he neither takes part in its work nor accepts responsibility for it, he will lose repute and authority with the tribal chiefs, and will not be likely to re-establish satis factory relations with them. His consent and goodwill are therefore essential. Again, unless the territorial limits within which the force may operate as a corps are strictly defined, it may be tempted to embark upon hazardous adventures and may suffer a reverse that might entail the despatch of a regular force from India. The corps should be under the same restrictions against taking the offensive against the enemy in the interior as have been placed upon the Indian garrison.

Grey’s observations on this point. 1 have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Crewe.3 ENCLOSURES. ENCLOSURE No. 1 :—India Office to Foreign Office. P. 5152. Sir, India Office, 31st December 1913. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram* to his successor. The Marquess of Crewe agrees with the Government of India that one of these should be postponement of the revision of the commercial treaty of 1891. With regard to the suggestion made by Sir P. Cox in his telegram of 14th October last that the Sultan should be asked to agree to the creation (wholly or partially at his expense) of a levy corps commanded by British or Indian officers in the event of his failing to come to terms with the tribal chiefs, Lord Crewe proposes to consider it apart from the question of the continuance of the subsidies. He would be glad to know whether Sir E. Grey sees any objection to the proposal, either as regards any possible French opposition, or as to principle or expediency. As regards the suggestion that the Sultan should further be required to undertake not to conclude fresh treaties with foreign Powers without the consent of His Majesty’s Government, I am to advert to the last paragraph of Sir R. Ritchie s letter of 19th July 1911, and to say that Lord Crewe trusts that, in view of the improved relations now happily existing with the French Government in connection with Muscat, Sir E. Grey will see his way to open the question with them. The term “ foreign Powers ” should presumably be understood to mean Powers other than France and Great Britain. The increased interest shown by Germany in the Persian Gulf seems to make such an agreement with the Sultan even more desirable than it was two years ago, and His Lordship would prefer to make it one of the conditions of the renewed subsidies ; but if difficulty and delay on the part of the French Government are to be anticipated, he realises that this may be impracticable. The Government of India do not refer to the question, which has often been discussed, of requiring the Sultan to place his customs under the management of a British or Indian official, and Lord Crewe is disposed to think that the moment is not opportune to raise it. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, T. W. Holderness. receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo (P. 5152) relative to the continuance to the present Sultan of Muscat of the subsidies granted to his predecessor. As regards the proposal that the Sultan should be asked to agree to the creation of a levy corps commanded by British or Indian officers in the event of his failing to come to terms with the tribal chiefs, Sir E. Grey has no objection to offer from an international point of view so long as the corps is nominally a Muscat force, and the officers by whom it is commanded nominally in the Sultan’s service. Precedents are not lacking to justify the conclusion of such an arrangement by an independent sovereign. which the subsidies granted to the late Sultan of Muscat should be continued Foreign Office. ENCLOSURE No. 2 :—Foreign Office to India Office. No. 83. Sir, 23rd January 1914. 1 am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the Foreign Office, S. 234. A 2As regards the proposal that the Sultan should be required to furnish an undertaking not to conclude with foreign Powers, other than Great Britain and France, fresh treaties without the assent of His Majesty’s Government, Sir E. Grey concurs in the opinion of the Marquess of Crewe that such an arrange ment would in itself be desirable in British interests, but he would wish to make the following observations on the suggestion :— This country is under a treaty obligation to France to respect the inde pendence of the Sultan of Muscat, and the exaction from His Highness of an undertaking of the kind proposed would undoubtedly constitute an interference with his sovereign rights. Were His Majesty’s Government to ask the French Government to agree to an arrangement whereby the Sultan would be bound not to enter into any treaty with a third Power without the assent of Great Britain, there is little doubt that the French Government, on their side, would demand that France should be put on a footing of equality with Great Britain in this matter. Such a demand would involve the conclusion by the Sultan of an agreement not with the Government of India but with Great Britain and France stipulating that without their assent he shall not enter into a treaty with any third Power. Such an arrangement would be to the advantage of France, and there is little doubt that the French Government would agree to it. Sir E. Grey is, however, in doubt whether the Government, of India would welcome the assumption by France of so leading a position at Muscat, even though the particular danger they apprehend—that of the intervention of other European Powers—would thereby be removed. Should the Government of India raise no objection to such an arrangement the agreement to be concluded between His Majesty’s Government and the French Government might be to the effect that the two Powers, while not desiring to interfere with the independence of Muscat, to which they are pledged by the Treaty of 1862, are most anxious not to see any material modification of the existing relations of the Sultanate with other Powers, and have therefore agreed to obtain from the Sultan an assurance that he will not enter into fresh treaties with any Power other than Great Britain and France without their knowledge and approval. It would probably be sufficient to affect this agreement by an exchange of notes which need not necessarily be published. Should the Government of India reject this suggestion Sir E. Grey is willing, should it be desired, to approach France with their proposal in its original form, but he has no confidence that they will accept it, least of all without difficulty and delay. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State W. Langley. for India.No. Cf. 25, dated Bushire, the 11th (received 20th) July 1914. From— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating 1 Political Resident in the Persian Gulf? To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Govern ment of India and, should it be deemed advisable, for record, copy of a petition to tlie address of the Political Agent, Maskat, received from the vast majority of British Indian subjects, trading in Oman territory, in which they represent the insecurity of life and property in the hinterland of Oman, the weakness of His Highness the Sultan’s authority over the tribes of the interior and, in their own language, the danger to the life and property of British subjects. 2. In my opinion, these dangers are much exaggerated and His High ness’s authority over the tribesmen is no less than has frequently, in Oman history, been the case in the past. British prestige in Oman probably stands as high at present, if not higher, than it ever did before. The Political Agent informs me that the more immediate grievances represented in the petition have been attended to and redressed by His High ness the Sultan. To the petition is attached an Appendix A which refers to various petitions for losses sustained by British subjects at the hands of the rebels and during the recent bombardments for which they claim compensation. With regard to this, His Highness has agreed that the best plan would be to appoint a 'joint committee of enquiry, composed of His Highness’s own representatives and our own, to investigate the claims. I expect a further report in due course. Honoured Sir, We the undersigned leading British merchants beg to bring following to your kind attention— It is an admitted fact that the Sultan of Maskat has lost all his authority over the interior tribes, they are at present all powerful; also His Highness has only nominal authority on the coast line. The tribesmen are becoming emboldened and they have now little respect for British rights. The British subjects have large outstandings among the tribes, but His Highness the Sultan in his piesent condition is unable to help us. We have waited long, hoping that the Sultan will regain his lost influence, but in vain; our future prospects seem dark in the extreme so w'e think that now the time is come, when our Government should take some active steps for the protection of the rights and prestige of British subjects, instead of relying on the Sultan who is powerless to redress their grievances; some other method should be adopted to protect our rights. Some exemplary punishment should be in flicted directly on the tribes who ignore British rights, and some direct arrange ments should be made with the responsible leaders of the interior as well as those of the coast towns, so that they should be made responsible for the life and property of British subjects directly to our Government. If such direct steps are not taken, we think that the interior people think ing that they are only responsible to the Sultan who is powerless to punish them will grow more bold and thus British interests and the life and property of British subjects will be in still greater danger. To His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and Political Agent, Maskat. Dated Maskat, the 20th June 1914. 14 A - t India, Foreign Secretary s No 30 M, dated 23 JUL 1914The greatest danger wliicli threatens to ruin the prospects of British merchants is the intention of His Highness to levy 25 % duty on exports and imports. Exports. —Hates, dry and wet, are the chief products of export business in this country. Large amounts are advanced by British merchants to the growers of dates, who in return bring their dates to merchants for selling and thus British merchants recover part of their outstandings and earn some profits thereby. Now when such cargo is put under 25 % extra tax from the tribes men, they will not bring their products to British merchants and avoid the extra duty by smuggling their products through some out of the way ports, as it is an admitted fact that His Highness is unable to guard the whole (of) the coast line. The interior people can manage to charter sailing vessels, they have their agents in Indian and Bed Sea ports ; so they can easily send ’ their goods directly and thus the British merchants will be ruined by this extra duty. Imports.—1 l\\q same remarks can be applied to the import traclfe. His Highness being unable to blockade the coast line and owing to the whnt of Customs organisation, goods from Debai and other ports are constantly smuggled by the coast line, from whence the interior people can get their supplies. 0 Under the circumstances, it can be seen that British merchants, nearly all of whom are law-abiding people, will not be able to trade, and the trade and profit will, undoubtedly, go to the Arab smugglers. The new season begins from the first week of July and if the matter is not adjusted in this month, the merchants will suffer heavy losses. We shall be highly obliged if your honour will forward a copy of this which is enclosed herewith to Major S. G. Knox, Bcsident at Bushire, for his information.

In continuation of my letter No. 1659, dated 31st May 1914,1 have the honour to report that, on the 4th June, the Political Agent at Maskat men tioned to the Sultan the subject of the projected Abu Dhabi expedition against the rebels. His Highness explained that the proposal to send reinforcements from Abu Dhabi was not of recent date, that Shaikh Hamdan’s co-operation with a force in his support at Barka was suggested before the bombardment of that place by H.M.S. “ Pox ” in April 1914, but that, on the retirement of the rebels at the close of these operations, he had cancelled these arrangements and had subsequently had no idea of renewing them. His Highness appeared fully to realise the danger of infection if troops from the infected area were sent to Sohar or the interior. The Political Agent reports that he explained to His Highness the latter portion of my communication and that he generally agreed, but seemed reluc tant to initiate conciliatory measures so soon as he said they would probably be misinterpreted by rebels to mean weakness and would perhaps embolden them to undertake further hostilities. He said that after a few weeks, and if the moment seemed opportune, he would give conciliatory measures a trial. His Highness has left in “ Nur-ul-Bahr” on a coast tour from Batinah to Sur to examine the present situation for himself.

I have the honour to forward herewith, in case it may prove of interest, the translated copy of an extract from the Arabic newspaper “ An Najah ” of Zanzibar, dated 23rd April 1914, on the situation in Oman. This translation was forwarded to me by the Political Agent, Maskat, to whom His Highness handed the copy of the newspaper in question. Translated extract copy of an article from the Arabic newspaper “An Najah ”, Zanzibar, As to the news of the capital (Maskat), the Sultan selected from among the officers of the State, Saiyid Ali bin Salim (Abdulla bin Said) Al Khalili, Rashid bin TJzaiz, Said bin Musallam, Zubair and Shubaili and consulted them as to the remedy of the trouble. They suggested that he should secure (British) protection, hut he declined to do so. They, however, urged him, so he went to the (British) Consul and parleyed with him. The Consul at first hesitated or showed reluctance in order to bring him (the Sultan) under his power, but he (the Sultan) interviewed him again and then he (the Consul) accepted (the Sultan’s proposal) and went to Barka on board a battle ship and saw the situation there and ordered his subjects to come down to Matrah and remain there. The man-of-war remained there three days and then returned to Maskat. This matter deserves consideration as also the fact that if (British) protec tion had been granted then the (British) troops stationed at Bait-al-Ealaj would not have been drawn oft to India together with their stores, and that, too, in spite of the request of the Saiyid for their protection. The Consul did not consent to keep them and about 150 men only are remaining now. And there are other things, besides these, which indicate that there is disagreement (between His Highness and the British Government). And if it is true that that was what those (above named) men counselled (His Highness to do), then really these councillors have dragged Oman and its inhabitants to ruin and destruction and history will relate their crime to the coming generations up to the day-of-judgement j But we do not suppose that this wise king will rashly jump into such a critical position and embark on the ship of haste which will mean nothing but a long or lasting regret. Ihe whole community of Islam trusts that he will not do so. There was enough scope for giving better advice only if they (the councillors) had shown their sincerity; however, there may he something behind the scene (lit. hills) the snares of the jingling yellow thing (gold) which subdues the wise. And there is in Maskat a Turk called Muhammad Amin whom the Saiyid has engaged on a salary of Rs. 150 per mensem and he has been entrusted with the military training of local young men. Some eight youths have already- joined this class. What will a wise man think of such an undertaking at such a critical time! dated the 26th Jamadi I, 23rd April 1914. * * * * India, Foreign Secretary 3 No 24 dated 11 J!

Knox, C.I.E., Officiating' Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to forward, in case it may he of interest, a translation of an article, which appeared in a recent number of the “ Sada-ad-Dastur ” of Basrah in regard to events in Oman. Translation of article in Basrah newspaper Sada-ad-Dastur ” No. 27—69, dated the 1st May 1914. Mask at. (By our learned correspondent there.) How long and whereto ? Here is found, on the sea-shore of Maskat, a youth whose head is covered up and whose mind is disturbed, shaking his fingers in the open space as if indicating the throbs of his heart, which imply, “ How long and whereto ,, ? Here is a youth who has been taught by events as to how is the love of mother-land and as to how is the taste of independence—the shadow of which he sees to be withdrawing from him every day, while he is utterly unable to do anything, for there is no power or control to check the evils which befall his country 'at present and future. So, how long and whereto shall this lead ? I have written previously and described the fights which took place around Bark ah and how the wheel of fortune turned against the Buler of Maskat, who enlisted the assistance of the English, and that of the Bani Battash tribesmen, who were aiound Kuriat, and I promised your readers to furnish them with the details concerning these two questions. In fulfilment of my promise, I state the following as a service to the Dastur and Truth. The siege of Kuriat was prolonged and brought about distress for its inhabitants, who were unable to defend themselves against the evils which have befallen them. When their patience in the hope of receiving reinforcement was exhausted and they were tired out by the siege, they surrendered the town to the tribesmen after removing what they liked and the enemy entered it triumphantly on the next day. When this news reached him at Barkah, the Buler did not make light of the affair and proceeded to Kuriat on board his yacht, which was accompanied bv the British ship. On his arrival at Kuriat, the British ship opened her guns on the town in compliance with the Buler’s request and demolished it. The enemy ran away after losing many lives, but the town was demolished so badly that there remains not a single house worth living in. When the Buler attained this object and was satisfied, he returned to Barkah where he found that the revolutionists had prepared to attack the town from a certain road by which the ship’s shells could not reach them except after the demolition of the town. The Buler has only a few tribesmen with him, as the majority of them dispersed when they saw the events which occupy my mind as to the future of Maskat and its independence. As to the English, it appears to me that their desires will not end with the bombardment of the rebels and they desire that the reins of affairs should be entrusted to them. In another word, they want to deal the last blow to the independence of Maskat, but there are many things hidden in time which are only known to God.2 Again, in the issue No. 29—69, dated 16th May, it states:— Sow were the scenes of battle at Barkah. (By our learned correspondent.) When the town of Kuriat was totally demolished and there remained no inhabitants in it, the B-uler returned to Barkah as he found that the enemy * had returned to attack it. The readers must have noted from my previous letters as to how the Ruler’s forces were dispersed and how the number of his men was diminished as compared to the ever-increasing number of the rebels, but this did not prevent the Ruler from persevering against his opponents. It behoves me here to mention the extraordinary courage and bravery displayed by Saiyid Nadir in fighting against the enemy despite the small number of his men, so that it may remain as a lasting monument to him. The enemy attacked Barkah in the afternoon and tried to enter it by force of arms, but Saiyid Nadir stood as a barrier before him. Having divided his party into two sections, he kept one between the town and the house of Wali Sulaiman which had been occupied by the enemy, while he proceeded with the other section to the right of the army, when a hot fight took place between both sides. Saiyid Dhiyab, Saiyid Nadir’s uncle, used sometime to go between the two sections and encourage them to persevere and some time exposed himself to death side by side with Saiyid Nadir until they compelled the enemy to retreat to the coast where he was a target to the shells of the British ship, which played an important part in the fight. The enemy stood between the fire of the ship’s guns and the volleys of Saiyid Nadir for some time and then retreated as far as Balad Nakhl. He has not ventured to resume war up to now. The number of the enemy’s killed and wounded is great, but I have not learned the proper reckoning. This will come to light of course, and I shall state it. The section of Bani Abu Hassan, one of the tribes which have thrown in their lot with the Ruler of Maskat, deserted from the army. The Sultan ordered that they should be overtaken and fired upon if they refuse to return to the army. This was done as they refused compliance, and three of them were killed and many wounded. The chief gunner of the Maskat Government contracted a severe fever while he was in the front near Barkah and was brought to Maskat where he died on the 6th Jamadi II, being mourned by all in view of his great services in the war. The Government have seized 13 notables of Barkah and imprisoned them as there had appeared proofs of their treason, and it has been confirmed to the Ruler that the Omanis do not desire to assist him much as he extends his boundaries to them. The Baluchis and Persians who fight in conjunction with the army have received the favours of the Ruler in view of the proof they have given of their sincerity. The British Government have made no condition for its assistance to the Ruler, but it is sure that the advantage derived by Britain from this assistance would be enormous even if it has not come to light.No. 1659, dated Bushire, the 31st May 1914 (Confidential). From— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to report that advices have been received from the Residency Agent, Sharjah, under date 9th May, that the Shaikh of Abu Thabi, after vainly trying to persuade the Shaikh of Dibai to join him, has started for Baraimi with a view to collecting forces and proceeding to Sohar and thence to Maskat by sea to the assistance of His Highness the Sultan against the rebels. 2. On the 25th May, the Political Agent reported that His Highness had in contemplation various schemes tor levying enhanced taxes 25 per cent, ad valorem on— (1) merchandise coming from interior for export to coast towns; (2) on rll imports leaving coast towns for the interior; (3) prohibition of all food stuffs to coast towns which are general ports for the interior. Partly, owing to the Political Agent’s arguments and partly, the Political Agent thinks, to His Highness realising that he cannot enforce these orders without a reliable customs staff and the assistance of His Majesty’s ships, for neither of which has His Highness cared to ask the Political Agent, these schemes have now been abandoned or reduced to little or nothing. On receipt of these reports, I addressed the Political Agent, Maskat, as follows :— “ While reluctant to dissuade His Highness from any measures likely to reassert his authority over his rebellious tribesmen, I cannot but view with apprehension the despatch of troops from the plague-stricken Trucial Coast to the interior of Oman. Nor can I forget the enormous cost, without any corresponding advantage to His Highness, of this Shaikh’s former efforts to assist His Highness **. “ Indeed, a more effective way of reasserting His Highness’s authority would appear to he, now that he has with British assistance, inflicted a serious reverse on the rebels, to endeavour to ascertain whether his subjects of the interior have or have not serious grievances against His Highness’s officials and to seek to conciliate them by better methods of administration and not by large gifts in money without corresponding return in service. The same thought has probably occurred to you and no doubt you will endeavour to turn His 'Highness’s thoughts in this direction rather than where they seem now tending, viz.) punitive measures that can only lead to further disturbances and heavy expenditure. “ It would be well if His Highness could be induced to discourage the Abu Thabi expedition. ” I venture to hope that these instructions are sufficiently in accord with the policy of the Government of India in Oman as to meet with approval and that the terms and method in which they have been convoyed may be found free from objection.No. 85—1462 1X.-D., dated the 22nd April 1914.

I have given instructions that not less than two ships are to be kept in Maskat waters while present unsettled conditions exist. H. M. S. “ Dartmouth ” at Maskat, 14th April 1914. Sir, I have the honour to report that I arrived and anchored off Kuriat at 1-45 p.m. to-day and found there His Highness the Sultan of Maskat in his yacht, who, after a Conference with the Political Agent, sent a message ashore to the rebels in occupation of one of his forts to surrender and send off their head man within an hour, and informing them that in case of non-compliance they would be bombarded. After a lapse of one hour and half, there being no signs of His Highness’s order being complied with, he, in the meantime having come on board II. M. S. “Dartmouth”, requested me to destroy the fort. This I carried out and also shelled other parts of the place occupied by the rebels. The rebels bolted thus releasing the Sultan’s troops and subjects who had been besieged in one of the forts for six days. The Sultan, who arrived at Kuriat this morning, was bred on by the rebels from various points on his arrival. On the rebels bolting, the Sultan’s subjects set fire to the huts and property of certain tribes who had refused to support them and had given shelter to the rebels, these tribesmen having bolted with the rebels. At 7 p.m., at the request of the Sultan, I fired a couple of shell at a small island where some rebels were concealed and from which place he had been fired on this morning; he at the same time landed some troops to engage them. lie reported on his troops arriving at the island the rebels had fled. The Sultan having informed me that he did not require any further assistance, I left for Maskat at 9-45 p.m., arriving there at 12-15 A.M., 15th April. The Sultan had been unable to obtain information of the result of bombardment by the time I left. The fort was demolished. On His Highness’s arrival on board H. M. S. “ Dartmouth,” I hoisted his Standard at the Main and saluted him with 21 guns on leaving. I am forwarding under separate cover the quantity of ammunition expended. The Commander-ia-Chief, H. M.

I have the honour to inform you that, under date 17th April 1914., the Residency Agent, Sharjah, reports that Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid of Abu Dhabi has been endeavouring to stir up his friends, the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast towns from Dibai to Ras-al-Khaimah and the Bedouin tribes of the hinterland, such as the Bani Katab, the Khawatr and Al Ghafala, inviting them, in view of the friendship and treaties existing between him and them, to go to the assistance of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. Shaikh Hamdan’s efforts have had no result, partly on account of the pearling season, the lack of money on the Trucial Coast owing to the poor prices at which last year’s catch was sold, and the difficulty for the Bedouin of moving their animals about during the heat. The inference that the rebel chieftains will probably find it equally diffi cult to induce their partisans to stir up serious trouble for His Highness during the present season is interesting.

Docket telegram, No. 108, dated the 25th April 1914. From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Please see mv telegram No. 93 of 18th April. Sultan has now informed me that the three French guns he purchased were machine guns. Two of these were of the “Mitrailleuse Automatique Hochkiss ^ pattern (cooled by air), of which he showed me illustrations in a French catalogue, and one which is described in an illustrated pamphlet supplied hy Louis Dieu as “ The new German Machine Gun.” Pamphlet was in English, but printed abroad. In this connection please see your Maskat letter No. 38 of 21st February 1914 to Captain Birdwood, in charge of current duties, Bushire, with its enclosure. Sultan is having difficulties with Messrs. Claborough &amp; Johnstone of Birmingham who are unable to supply pattern of gun asked for by His Highness and are trying to substitute another pattern which His Highness does not want. His Highness has now cabled home cancelling his order with Claborough &amp; Johnstone, and has asked me to obtain from Armstrong, Whitworth details of cost, landed at Maskat, of their 75 m/m (2*953 inch) Quick-Firing Gun on Mountain Carriage, of which he has a specification and coloured illustration issued by Armstrong, Whitworth and marked “ Confidential ”. This was furnished to him by Claborough &amp; Johnstone, who wish to obtain His Highness’s order for it. His Highness, however, wishes to deal direct and avoid middleman’s expenses. Price quoted by Claborough for this gun with pack saddles and accessories is £1,400 and ammunition £350 per 100 shells. Is there any objection to my obtaining the necessary information from Armstrong for His Highness ? I doubt if His Highness seriously intends to buy this expensive gun. He remarked that ) British guns, as compared with French, were very expensive, and he seems to have taken a great fancy to the French pattern which he says he cannot obtain in the English market. Claborough’s attitude too has caused him some annoyance. His Highness also complains that he is unable to obtain from British firms the detailed and fully illustrated general catalogues which j the French firms always supply and of which he showed me a great number. i The impression left on my mind by His Highness’s conversation was that he was anxious to show, in amplification of his last explanation on the subject, what good reasons he had for placing his order with a French firm.

His Highness explained that his present household and city guards, about 300 men, were unreliable lot enlisted by his father from Yemen and elsewhere and that their officers were a ogether coriupt. It was, he said, in order to obtain local men to replace these hat proclamation was published. His Highness proposes to enlis 200 selected men m lieu of 300. His Highness said he had already written to India for services of a pensioned Indian Officer of the Indian army to be in charge of them. His Highness, however, added that there had'been verv meagre response to his proclamation and scarcely 20 men had volunteered tor service. His Highness dees not wish levy corps to be employed in any way within palace precincts or as civil guards, for which duties he desires to make his own arrangements as heretofore. I think that in this matter his Wishes should bo respected. His Highness asked that lew corps should be for the present not more than 300 strong including two British officers, and he asked me to submit details of scheme as soon as possible. I should be glad if Officer Commanding, Mekran Lew Corps, could be -uide Send me a§ S0 ° n &amp;S P ° ssible papcrs tliat wouId assist me and serve as As regards (2), I communicated Government of India’s views as to collective significance of points mentioned in your telegram No. 419, April the i, and 4^3, April the 9th.

The situation at Maskat has so much, improved owinsr to set back given to rebels by the action of His Majesty’s ships that the Government of India consider that no further action now appears necessary beyond pushing tj 1 ' tt- V u 8e ^ erne an ^ taking suitable notice of the unsatisfactory attitude of His Highness the Sultan. We propose following action :— Firstly.--As regards Levy scheme. The Sultan should he reminded bv 'i/ 1 ^ that it is entirely thanks to the action taken on his behalf by Government that the rebels have lost heart, but that Government of India cannot undertake for an indefinite period to retain troops for the protection of Maskat and Matra at their own expense, and that it is essential that His Highness should without further delay, in consultation with Political Agent, formulate a scheme for Levy Corps on lines which are likely to satisfy the Government of India. In this connection Government view with surprise and disapproval the ill-judged and precipitate action of His Highness the Sultan, as reported in telegram No. 118, dated the 30th April, from Political Agent and will be constrained not only to suspend and recover loan hut to devote subsidy to maintenance of Indian garrison at Matra unless Sultan applies imself in earnest to formulation of scheme and desists from foolish waste of money supplied by Government. Secondly. The Government of India do not consider that any of the matters reported in your telegrams Nos. 419'and 423/dated 8th and 9th April, respectively, are of sufficient importance to call for separate treatment, but His Highness the Sultan of Maskat should be informed that collectively they indicate very unsatisfactory and misguided attitude on his part and that it ‘ may become necessary for Government of India to reconsider their present benevolent attitude towards him unless he can speedily satisfy them that he means to turn over new leaf and show himself more deserving of their support/Telegram, No. 565, dated (and received) tbe 11th May 1914.

Following are most significant items of W /' £iXst.-Sultan has apparently annealed to Vali of Pas rah for help in men or money. 1 11 lor Igcopdly.-, A jamadar Kasim, lately returned from Pasrah, is said to have arranged with a ^atnan Abdur Rahman, Jamadar Chokidar of Messrs. n vev , ’Mackenzie Pasrah, to enlist 200 Rathans for service with Sultan. f ^ |V • A[i a ltempt is to be made to enlist Baluchis from Bampur. - 1 Pl n Bali.ii, late Sultan's cousin, accom panied by Abd-el-Aziz, French Consulate dragoman, visited French Consul three times on 3rd April. We cann °t regard with equanimity any of these measures. Firstly• It is difficult to see what nossible resoons e Tr aiir ali of Basrah can rive this wild appeal , and I think that Political Agent might simply address a remonstrance to 3ultan showing its futility and folly. Secondly and thirdly. Unorganised Patnans and Baluchis will only add to disorderly element’ in town and probably decamp -'ith any arms and ammunition given to them possibly purchasing others. They will be entirely useless against local Arabs. Political Arent should emphasize discouragement of these plans. riHirt’ily. j t, dnk that Political Agent should endeavour to learn independently and by direct enquiry from His Highness significance of All's visit to French Consul. A talk over the situation with his French colleague might possibly elicit, useful information. He should report by telegraph result. lime has, I think, now come for a straight talk with ^ultan pointing out .idiotic wasting of money on Ms forces. t :1 0 Omani tribes are following out their old policy of bleeding Multan. One section draw payment from nim and render no service in excnange, the other are in possession of his territory and feed on his estates. He should be warned that we will not lend money to be squan dered in obese directions and snail forbid our subjects to lend him money either, until he gives us guarantee that thesethese loans and revenues of country are being spent in serious efforts to pacify it, especially the Wady Saraail. ror the present, it seems impossible to do anything except stick to M askat--'atrah enclave, organise Levy n or pp; an( j prepare for an advance to hamail in October next. The object of this advance would be to instal Nadir, or so,.;e other well qualified selection of Sultan there as Governor, have forts at Bidbid and Samail put in thorough order and garrisoned by at least a company each of the new Levy Cor os whose headquarters should be in hib. it would probably be necessary to lea^e a double company with machine gun ready at Baitalfalaj to frighten off any marauding raiders down Wady Adai behind back of ,,T ady Samail . Political advisers, preferably selected natives of India, paid from customs revenues and in close touch with Political Agent, would be required, one at Maskat for Sultan and one at Samail for Nadir. Latter could gradually, in consultation with Nadir, subsidize selected tribal petty chiefs to maintain communication from Samail to Sib and Maskat. when these arrangements are complete, our troops could withdraw. 1 g is essentially a cold weather job and would necessitate employment of troops for from two to three months next winter and maintenance of ^aitalfalaj garrison to end of year. Put it seems only hope of re-establishing Sultan's authority, a useful auuet to us. As overmaterial assistance, Sultan should, undertake to manage Itaskat and T ;atra custom-house under our advice and devote (his ?) on its subsidy to expense of Levy Corps and secret buu effective understanding tiiat he will correspond with no foreign Covernments unrepresented at tiaskat except t.irough us. In our turn, we bear all costs of expedition to re-establish his authority in Samail and balance of expenditure on Levy Corps. Addressed Oovernment of India; repeated L’askat.Telegram. P.

From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Urgent. Your telegram No. 423 of 9tli April and Government of India telegram No. 207§ of I2th April. French Consul indisposed, and I have not been able to see him. Following is result of interview I had with Sultan on 16th April when I informally mentioned subject-matter of your obove-mentioned telegram under 4 : Firstly, His Highness said he knew nothing whatever about the visits on 3rd April last of Ali Bin Salim and Abd-el-Aziz to French Consul, but he promised to make immediate enquiries. In this connection His Highness told me that on His Highness’s return to Maskat recently from Barka, French Consul sent a letter to meet him on board in which he referred to the reported intention of Sultan to advance into the interior and requested him to see that no injury was done to property and family of Abd-el-Aziz who reside there. His High ness said he had not replied to letter. He added Abd-el-Aziz gave news to Imam and wrote disparagingly about the British Government and Sultan to curry favour with Imam and thus secure safety of his family and property. Sultan also informed me that French Consul received a letter from Imam on 14th April complainiug that British Government had bombarded Barka with out any warning and that this was most irregular. This letter, His Highness said, was delivered to French Consul by American Vice-Consul Mohomet Fazal and that French Consul replied verbally that he could do nothing in the matter. Sultan added there was also a letter for me from Imam. This letter however has not been delivered to me yet. I am making enquiries about it. Secondly .—I emphasized folly of wasting money on his Arab forces and on enlistment of unreliable foreigners from Basrah and elsewhere, and I referred especially to his correspondence with Vali of Basrah and recruitment of Afghans through the Chokidar of Grey’s Company of Basrah. His High ness emphatically denied having sought financial assistance from Vali of Basrah, but he admitted enlistment of about one hundred Baluchis from Basrah and Mekran who were, he said, maintained for protecting his palace and to replace similar number of his own useless and unreliable troops. His Highness promised to discontinue further enlistment and assured me that the money would be expended in every way acceptable to Government. Thirdly.—W\s Highness said he hoped that the British force would be sent to punish the rebels. I told him that I could not give any definite assurance on this point. ‘ I explained the object of the scheme and details of subsequent organisation as outlined in your telegram. 'Sultan generally approved of the scheme. I referred to cost of British expedition also, if one were sent. His Highness demurred at suggestion that Maskat customs should be managed under our advice. In this connection he said “ I will give the British Government Gwadur or Hhufar as compensation for expenses of expedition instead.” Fourthly.—As regards Levy Corps, His Highness asked how enlistment would be done and whether his own Maskat subjects who were anxious to serve would be enlisted. I said enlistment would be under British officer and that probably nucleus of selected Baluchi or Brahui would be first established, with which it might subsequently be possible to mingle some selected men of his own. His Highness approved. Question of participation of Government in cost of Corps -was not raised by His Highness or myself, but His Highness thought Zanzibar subsidy would more than cover cost.

Your telegram of 20th April. I venture to submit following explanation of my action in discussing with Sultan matters other than Ali’s visit to French Consul. Your telegram No. 207, 11th April, authorised me to informally take steps suggested in “fourthly ” of Bushire telegram 423. Latter telegram con tained two paragraphs headed “ fourthly ”, the second of which, as decyphered by me, formed final property of the telegram.

In forwarding the enclosed letter No. 37—14 of 11th April 1914, from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, I have the honour to inform the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty that the situation at Barka has been , , , developing since 22nd ultimo (as shown Not attached to this copy. -iji • /• pji i* by the accompanying precis of telegraphic correspondence) when it was first reported that the Imam and his followers were threatening to attack the place after capturing the town of Nakhl owing to the treachery of the Sultan’s adherents. 2. On the 10th instant, the Political Agent, Maskat, represented to me that he had received an urgent letter from His Highness the Sultan of Maskat asking for assistance as the rebels were then within half a mile of Barka, and as all his forces with the exception of a small number of Baluchis had gone over to the enemy, he was powerless to withstand their attack. 3. After conferring with the Political Agent, I directed the “Pox” to proceed to Barka the same evening and to convey Colonel Benn, Political Agent, so that the situation could be discussed with His Highness on the spot with the least possible delay. 4. I also authorized the Captain of “ Fox ” to shell any fort within range of his guns which he might find to be occupied by the rebels, provided he and the Political Agent considered the events justified it and that it was done at the express request of His Highness the Sultan. 5. This was carried out as will he seen from Captain Caulfeild’s report on the morning of 11th April, and the “ Fox ” returned to Maskat the same afternoon. 6. A rumour has since reached Maskat that there were about 30 casual ties, hut this is as yet unconfirmed. 7. An attack on the port of Kurait, 28 miles south-east of Maskat, is also threatened. The situation is therefore being closely watched and short of landing men from His Majesty ships which would only be authorised in the case of direct necessity, I am prepared with the concurrence of the Political Authorities and in response to requests which may be received from the Sultan to shell any positions taken up by the rebels which may be within range of the ship’s guns. r India.

Sir, I have the honour to report that, in compliance with your orders, H.M.S. “Fox”, after embarking Political Agent, left Maskat at 6-30 p.m. on 10th April, anchoring off Barka close to the Sultan’s yacht “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” at 11 p.m. that evening. It was evident that fighting was in progress on shore ; repeated flashes were seen whilst the sounds of the firing accompanied by much shouting and many weird noises were distinctly audible. The Political Agent at once boarded the “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” and interviewed His Highness the Sultan who was very anxious that the bombardment of Barka’s Western, but it is believed “ gunless ”, Fort held by the rebels, as also of the Imam’s encampment half a mile further inland, should commence at daybreak before the Imam and his troops should have taken fright and decamped. As to prevent “ Target ” mistakes, it was necessary that the Sultan should be on board the firing ship. His Highness at 11-30 p.m. accompanied the Political Agent on his return to “ Fox ” which ship weighed at 4-45 A.M., on 11th April, and anchored as close inshore as possible. Some considerable delay occurred owing to the Sultan not having received assurance from shore that his subjects had been made aware of the nature and objective of “Fox’s ” bombardment; it was in fact not until 9-0 a.m. that the necessary assurances having been received fire was opened by H.M.S. “ Fox ” with 6' on the fort (about 1,000 yards inland) in question, at a range of 3,500 yards. Special attention was paid to the left hand tower and to the rebel flag still o’er flying it. After the 10th round (5 common, 5 lyddite), the flag flew no longer and the tower was in ruins. At His Highness’s special request, 5 rounds of 6' lyddite were then fired towards a spot (distant 4,300 yards) in the date groves at which some of the Imam’s followers were believed to be still encamped. Out of the total of fifteen 6' shell fired all burst, whilst so far as could be made out 6 or 7 out of the 10 lyddite shell detonated. As regards caswaftees, no estimate can be given ; two men, who were stand ing in a large opening (? entry port) at almost the exact spot •where the first shell struck, must have perished. Other men were seen at various places on the walls, but most of these disappeared after the first round. Much smoke evidently from camp-fires was seen inland during the morn ing pointing to the probability of a more or less general decampment during the night. The Sultan was obviously impressed with the results of the bombardment and freely expressed his thanks for the assistance rendered to him in his hour of need. I am sure that from the political point of view his presence as also that of his cousin and attendants on board the firing ship was most fortunate. His Highness and suite left to rejoin the “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” at 11-30 A.M. (on 11th) when H.M.S. “ Fox ” weighed and proceeded to Maskat. I have, &amp;c., F. W. Catjlfeiid.' ^48/-:.

I am informed that 21 men were immediately enlisted and given rifles (and) despatched to Barka and that Mekran Jamedar for Fort Jalali has stated that number of Baluchi are to arrive from Mekran next mail.

In an interview with a Times of India representative, a gentle men who has come down from the Gulf by this boat said that for some time past the rebels at Barka had, under their leader, aioused the displeasure of the Sultan of Muscat by doing different things to which he objected. For some time this had been going on and the people were generally giving trouble and quarrelling among themselves. The}’ refused to pay any regard to the Sultan and in order to show his authority sought the assistance of tire British Consul and requ 3sted that a warship should be sent to Barka. Amongst other matters the rebels had refused to pay certain fines that had been imposed upon them and matters having gone so far and the Sultan’s authority having been utterly disregarded, H. M. S. Dartmouth and H. M. S. Fox were despatched to Barka and informed the rebels that unless they paid the fines the town would be bombarded. They still defied authority, so the extreme step was shells into Barka. The fort was destroyed and other damage was done while several of the rebels were killed and others were wound ed. They were told that as soon as they paid the fines firing would cease and though the rebels maintained their attitude of defiance for some time they eventually gave in. “It is only from what I heard that I can say rebels were killed but I saw several , wounded brought into Muscat,” said the gentleman interviewed. “They were very troublesome and defiant before the warship opened fire on Barka but I can assure you that they were very humble afterwards and it was no fooling.

Officer Commanding troops here as regards transfer of double company from Bushire and we agree that this arrangement is feasible, but before double company leaves we would prefer relief by Company from India. Strength here will then be two companies, ample to provide guard, ensure safety of stores and to deal with outrages, but will not be able to protect Bushire against tribal invasion.

He reports that Shaikh Hamvar and Imam are greatly disheartened and have retired from Barka to the‘interior with their wounded. He states that they may give trouble in the interior, but doubts whether they will ever attempt operations against coast towns. Sultan also informed me that 19 Shaikhs were killed at Barka includino-the most important Shaikh Musalmat and another important Shaikh. He says that he has received no news from the direction of Kuriat. I have been desired by Sultan to convey, through you, an expression of his deep gratitude to Govern ment of India for grant of naval assistance and to Admiral for immediate despatch of men-of-war.

I Telegram P., No. 83, dated the 15th (received 10th) April 1914, From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—-The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Reference my telegrams Nos. 81 and 82, dated the 13th and 14th April, respectively. I arrived at Kuriyat yesterday. His Highness the Sultan had arrived some hours earlier and told me that on his arrival the Banibattash had opened fire upon him from three positions : viz., from the fort in the town, from Saad and from the island in the harbour, and that they had only desisted on sighting man-of-war. Certain local inhabitants who, while professing loyalty, had joined the Banibattash and had sheltered them and refused to support Wali and had encouraged the burning of the habitations of the Baluchis. With the exception of the fort in which Wali and 400 Baluchis had taken refuge, the whole town had been occupied by enemy who had set up white standard. His Highness on my arrival despatched orders to the rebels to surrender and to send within an hour their headmen to him, and intimating to them that their positions would be shelled if they did not obey the orders. There being no indication of compliance after an hour and-a-half Sultan came on board the man-of-war and at His Highness’s request His Majesty’s ship “Dartmouth” demolished the fort and other posi tions pointed out by Sultan and shelled the island. Rebels together with above-mentioned disloyal inhabitants fled, thus His Highness’s' troops and besieged. Sultan afterwards landed a party to clear island under search-light of man-of-war, but found that it was not occupied. His Highness then , signalled that ho was leaving immediately for Sur and did not require any further assistance and would return as soon as possible to Maskat. Sultan appeared anxious about the position at Sur. His Highness had no details up to the time of his departure of results of afternoon’s operations. Prior to bombardments of Barka and Kiiriyat there were, and as a matter of fact there still are, persistent reports of intention of Shaikh tiarayar to make an attack on Matra and of Banibattash to make an attack on Maskat and though these operations will without doubt have a deterrent effect, this may be only tem porary, and in ray opinion it behoves us to take measures of a precautionary nature having special regard to the spread of disaffection amongst Maskat 1 subjects which is generally reported, and the fact that rebels are now better situafed to attack than they were in 1913. Officer Commanding at Baitalfalaj whom I have consulted tells me that if enemy are at all enterprising, he would only be able to hold Matra and safeguard his own stores and that he should he relieved of any picqueting duty beyond Ruwd. I concur in his opinion and suggest that a double company should be ordered here to reinforce present numbers and that two warships should be deputed as a temporary measure for duty exclusively on this coast between Sur and Sohar, if this arrangement can he conveniently carried out. Addressed to Bushire; repeated to Naval Commander-in-Chief. India, Forek No IT r 1\ LS' Telegram P., No. 89, dated (and received) the 18th April 1914. From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. report as follows :—In continuation of my telegram 83, dated 15th April. Firstly—Sultan of Maskat came back from Sur yesterday. His Highness told me that he had imposed an enhanced customs tariff of 25 per • cent - as punishment on Banibuhass (Bani Battash) and Sharkiya tribes at Sur, the reason for imposition on the former being their disloyal behaviour and desertion at Barka, and on latter because of their reported intention to co operate with rebellious faction. His Highness on the return journey destroyed by fire all the huts and boats at Little Kuriat which is south-east of Kuriat proper and which was lately occupied by enemy. Sultan reports that number of casualties among enemy on 14th April is not obtainable, but is in all pro bability very small as rebels decamped before the bombardment. One British subject was killed ; he refused to take shelter with the Wali in fort. Secondly— Please see my telegram 80, dated 13th April. The British man-of-war “ Miner ” ' returned to Maskat from Barka last evening and her report is to effect that enemy reoccupied positions at Barka on 13th April. At request of His High ness Miner * dislodged rebels. On 14th April, rebels returned and were again dislodged by “ Miner’s ” gun. On 15th April, troops of Sultan engaged rebels, assisted by “ Miner’s ” 3-pounder gun. His Highness’s troops took possession of ruined fort which was recently demolished by British man-of-war “ Fox ” ; fort was then surrounded by rebels on all sides who were, however, finally dispersed by “ Miner ” and compelled to beat a retreat. On 16th April, Miner^ was recalled to Maskat. Casualties reported among rebels are 13 killed, including at least two important headmen. Casualties among His Highness s troops are 3 killed and 5 wounded. Last night Sultan left for Barka and begged that a British warship might be despatched to Barka. This morning Admiral and fleet left Maskat, but I was able to explain state of affairs to Admiral and Officers Commanding at Baitalfalaj last night. Thirdly— Information has reached me this morning from brother of Sultan who is here that the Banibattash have already collected at Affa in large numbers and are again threatening the peace of Kuriat whose Wali appeals for help to British Government. Fourthly—It is apparent that enemy have not been deterred by recent bombardments and in all probability they will strive to occupy coast towns from Batineh coast at Sohar to Sur below Kuriat. If these towns are to be saved for Sultan, then it is imperative in my opinion that at least two of His Majesty’s ships should be reserved exclusively for service on this coast as I have already suggested. If on the other hand our actions are to be con fined to protection of Matra and Maskat only, two men-of-war between Sidab and Barsait would probably be sufficient for requirements. But in this case and in view of rebels’ present activities and their menacing attitude, I am of opinion that, instead of a double company, one wing of regiment should be despatched to Maskat as soon as possible. It could make its headquarters at Buwi with a company at Sidab. Above measures are suggested by me on the assumption that Foreign and Political Department would not be disposed to carry out at once the more elaborate operations proposed for October next in your telegram of 9th April, No. 423.

Your telegram No. 423 of 9th April and Government of India telegram No. 207 of 12th April. French Consul indisposed, and I have not been able to see him. Following is result of interview I had with Sultan on 16th April when I informally mentioned subject-matter of your obove-mentioned telegram under 4 : Firstly, His Highness said he knew nothing whatever about the visits on 3rd April last of Ali Bin Salim and Abd-el-Azix to French Consul, but he promised to make immediate enquiries. In this connection His Highness told me that on His Highness’s return to Maskat recently from Barka, French Consul sent a letter to meet him on board in which he referred to the reported intention of Sultan to advance into the interior and requested him to see that no injury was done to property and family of Abd-el-Aziz who reside there. His High ness said he had not replied to letter. He added Abd-el-Aziz gave news to Imam and wrote disparagingly about the British Government and Sultan to curry favour with Imam and thus secure safety of his family and property. Sultan also informed me that French Consul received a letter from Imam on 14th April complaining that British Government had bombarded Barka with out any warning and that this was most irregular. This letter, His Highness said, w r as delivered to French Consul by American Vice-Consul Mohomet Fazal and that French Consul replied verbally that he could do nothing in the matter. Sultan added there was also a letter for me from Imam. This letter however has not been delivered to me yet. I am making enquiries about it. Secondly .—I emphasized folly of wasting money on his Arab forces and on enlistment of unreliable foreigners from Basrah and elsewhere, and I referred especially to his correspondence with Vali of Basrah and recruitment of Afghans through the Chokidar of Grey’s Company of Basrah. His High ness emphatically denied having sought financial assistance from Vali of Basrah, but he admitted enlistment of about one hundred Baluchis from Basrah and Mekran who were, he said, maintained for protecting his palace and to replace similar number of his own useless and unreliable troops. His Highness promised to discontinue further enlistment and assured me that the money would be expended in every way acceptable to Government. Thirdly .—His Highness said he hoped that the British force would be sent to punish the rebels. I told 1dm that I could not give any definite assurance on this point. I explained the object of the scheme and details of subsequent organisation as outlined in your telegram. Sultan generally approved of the scheme. I referred to cost of British expedition also, if one were sent. His Highness demurred at suggestion that Maskat customs should ! be managed under our advice. In this connection he said “ I will give the British Government Gwadur or Dhufar as compensation for expenses of expedition instead.” Fourthly .—As regards Levy Corps, His Highness asked how enlistment would be done and whether his own Maskat subjects who were anxious to serve would be enlisted. I said enlistment would be under British officer and that probably nucleus of selected Baluchi or Brahui would be first established, with which it might subsequently be possible to mingle some selected men of his own. His Highness approved. Question of participation of Government in cost of Corps was not raised by His Highness or myself, but His Highness thought Zanzibar subsidy would more than cover cost.

His Highness promises to keep me further informed. On the other hand, information has reached me here that certain Shaikhs fearing repetition of bombardment and realising that Sultan has our support are endeavouring to persuade Imam to come to terms with His Highness. I am also informed That Shaikh of Banibattash has despatched couriers inland commandino* headmen of eight towns to destroy all date groves which belong either to subjects of Sultan of Maskat or to Baluchis.

Prom—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Political Maskat reports by mail from Maskat under date 5th April series of events from 29th March. General situation appears to disquiet and Sultan’s efforts to raise money and enlist foreign aid do not reassure me. Following are most significant items of news. First .—Sultan has apparently appealed to Yali of Basrah for help in men |i or money. Secondly .—A Jamadar Kasim, lately returned from Basrah, is said to have arranged with a Pathan Abdur Rahman, Jamadar Chokidar of Messrs. Grey, Mackenzie, Basrah, to enlist 200 Pathans for service with Sultan. Thirdly .—An attempt is to be made to enlist Baluchis from Bampur. Fourthly .—Ali Bin Salim, late Sultan’s cousin, accompanied by Abd-el- Aziz, French Consulate dragoman, visited French Consul three times on 3rd April. We cannot regard with equanimity any of these measures. Firstly .—It is difficult to see what possible response Yali of Basrah can give this wild appeal, and I think that Political Agent might simply address a remonstrance to Sultan showing its futility and folly. Secondly and thirdly .—Unorganised Pathans and Baluchis will only add to disorderly element in town and probably decamp with any arms and ammunition given to them possibly purchasing others. They will be entirely useless against local Arabs. Political Agent should emphasize discouragement of these plans. Fourthly .—I think that Political Agent should endeavour to learn inde pendently and by direct enquiry from His Highness significance of Ali’s visit to French Consul. A talk over the situation with his French colleague might possibly elicit useful information. He should report by telegraph result. Time has, I think, now come for a straight talk with Sultan pointing out idiotic wasting of money on his forces. The Omani tribes are following out their old policy of bleeding Sultan. One section draw payment from him and render no service in exchange, the other are in possession of his territory and feed on his estates. He should be warned that w r e will not lend money to be squandered in these directions and shall forbid our subjects to lend him money either, until he gives us guarantee that these loans and revenues of country are being spent in serious efforts to pacify it, especially the Wady Samail. For the present, it seems impossible to do anything except stick to Maskat-Matrah enclave, organise Levy Corps and prepare for an advance to Samail in October next. The object of this advance would be to instal Nadir, or some other well qualified selection of Sultan there as Governor, have forts,5 at Bidbid ami Samnil put in thorough order and garrisoned by at least a com pany each of the new Levy Corps, whose headquarters shouid be in Sib. It would probably be necessary to leave a double company with Machine gun ready at Baitalfalaj to frighten off any marauding raiders down Wady Adai behind back of Wady Samaii. Political advisers, preferably selected natives of India, paid from customs revenues and in close touch with Political Agent, would be required, one at Maskat for Sultan and one at Samaii for Nadir. Latter could gradually, in consultation with Nadir, subsidize selected tribal petty chiefs to maintain communication from Samaii to Sib and Maskat. When these arrangements are complete, our troops could withdraw. It is essentially a cold weather job and would necessitate employment of troops for from two to three months next winter and maintenance of Baitalfalaj garrison to end of year. But it seems only hope of re-establishing Sultan’s authority, a useful asset to us. As stand over for this material assistance, Sultan should undertake to manage Maskat and Matrdh customhouse under our advice and devote (his?) on its subsidy to expense of Levy Corps and secret but effective understanding that he will correspond with no foreign Governments un represented at Maskat except through us. In our turn, we bear all costs of expedition to re-establish his authority in Samaii and balance of expenditure on Levy Corps.

Mv telegram 74 of 7th April. Following is result of my visit to Barka :— Sultan prefaced remarks on present situation by referring to delay in sanctioning of loan. I told him that the loan had been now sanction ed and added that as he had referred to the subject of delay I would explain reason for it and I then did so in th? sense of Government of India’s telegram No. 185 S., 4th April. His Highness frankly admitted purchase of two small guns from French firm. He said that he had recently purchased a breech- loading gun from British firm and as he could not find particular pattern of small quick-firing gun which he required in British market he had placed order with a French firm. He maintained he had full liberty of selection of sucli matters. I said the news of the French transaction received, as it was, simultaneous with his request for British loan, had not unnaturally suggested that there was perhaps some connection between the two and caused some hesitation on the part of Government. He replied that French guns had been already paid for and would be imported strictly in accordance with the Maskat warehouse Regulations and that money asked for now was for operations against the rebels and maintenance of his present following. In conclusion, he begged me to convey to Government of India his deep gratitude for loan. He has now taken bast 10,000 rupees and proposed to draw similar amount at intervals of week(s) or so. He will refund 5,000 monthly. Secondly. —Imam’s rising. Sultan thought situation most critical. Deput ation sent to Wady Maawal had reported whole of that district disaffected, large number had deserted from Imam and force he had sent to occupy position between Nakhl had (gone) over to enemy. I have been informed here that Yali of Mat rail who fears destruction of valuable estates he has in country occupied by Imam, was among the deserters. I estimate Sultan’s following at Barka at 1,500, but I think His Highness realises, what is undoubtedly a fact, that all except perhaps Baluchis are thoroughly unreliable. All this together with loss of Naktd fort has quite disheartened him. He now awaits certain Shaikhs from Batinah and will discuss further action with them. Sultan arrived here unexpectedly yesterday indisposed, but after few hours returned to Barka. He was not able to receive visit from Admiral, but he sent a message thanking His Excellency for having sent a man-of-war to Barka.6 Thirdly .—Sultan again referred to Levy Corps and clearly stated In's intention of establishing one trained by British officers. He suggested 300 would be sufficient for the present and promised to discuss details and cost later on.

He feared treachery and desertion of his following. He appeals for helping hand of Government and asks for man-of-war. I have discussed situation with Admiral who is here. His Excellency agrees that despatch of man-of-war is necessary and that if enemy found in occupation at Barka he would be justified in dislodging them. “ Eox ” will take me to Barka this afternoon. Arrivals from Barka in Sultan’s launch report enemy within a mile of the fort under Shaikh Saiyid Hamyar, who has challenged Sultan to fight.

From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. I have sent the following telegram to Knox :— Begins. Reference my telegram No. 77. Last night I arrived at Barka. Shaikh Hamyar and Imam were camped within a mile of Barka Fort. Fighting was in 'progress and rebels were attacking from an outlying fort which they had captured during yesterday and hoisted their standard thereon. I visited Sultan on his yacht immediately and His Highness requested that the enemy may be dislodged and for the captured fort to be demolished at daybreak. His Highness came on board His Majesty’s ship “ Fox ” and on Sultan making a written request “ Fox ” demolished the (fort) that had been captured by the enemy and shelled the rebels’ camp. The casualties of enemy are not known, but probably very small, as after the arrival of the “ Fox ” a very large number decamped during the night and rebels’ encampments were hidden in thick date grove. The immediate neighbourhood of Barka seemed to be clear of rebels and “Fox” left for Maskat. His Highness asked for another man of war to be sent to-morrow to stay for a short time at Barka, but as Senior Naval Officer thinks that it would probably not be convenient for the next few days during the Admiral’s visit to send man-of-war and in view of the effect this morning’s bombardment is bound to have on the rebels, Sultan was informed accordingly, but that on my return to Maskat arrangement could in all probability be made to send, as a temporary measure, an armed launch. His Highness will remain at Barka and after he has discussed future plan with his brother will return to Maskat.48 Telegram P., No. 207 S., dated the 11th April 1914.

I trust in the critical position of affairs at liarka that the Government of India will speedily authorise II. M. S. “lox ’ to render all possible assistance from the sea to Sultan. Unless however situation should unexpectedly improve, it would appear that action should tend more in the direction of present withdrawal than active operation, ror the renewal of their activities the rebels have done well in selecting the commencement of summer. Bis Highness the Sultan seems not to be able to oppose them, and I take it that just now we have no desire to under- take military operations. I entirely agree with Admiral and Political Agent, that it the rebels are in occupation at Earka, they should be shelled out. There are two questions which appear to call for early consideration (a) whether Sultan should not be advised by Political Agent to • husband bis financial resources by disbanding bis unreliable tribal following; and {b) whether garrison at Maskat should not be reinforced. If withdrawal from Earka is found necessary, no doubt, sea patrol wa c nng the coast from Matra to Earka will be maintained. A possible advance on capital would be hampered by man-of-war prepared to shell lar^e boats moving along coast. Jinds. 53 Telegram R., No. 80, dated (and received) the 13th April 1914.

Please see my telegram No. 77 of 10th April last portion. News from Quaryat has been rather conflicting, but there now seems to be little doubt that the situation there is serious. Informant who got away disguised as (a) woman states that at least 1,000 Banibatash have surrounded the fort in which Vali of Quaryat and 400 men, women and children are said to he collected. They have food but no water in the fort, and ask for assist ance. Sultan is at Barka, but his brother in charge here confirms news and considers that the situation critical. Besieged are all Baluchis, whose houses alone have been burnt, and also a few Arabs connected with Sultan’s family. Other inhabitants have not been molested. This suggests that invaders are working in co-operation with imam or at his instigation. Informant travelled by land and above news is three days old. Though I think that the news of’Barka bombardment when it reaches Quaryat will probably deter invaders from further committing themselves and although all British subjects are said to have left Quaryat, I think our assistance is called for and should be given.

Fighting at Nakhal commenced 23rd and Imam was reoorted 5 miles distant advancing towards Nakhal fort after taking which it was thought certain he would attack Barkah and then carry out his declared intention of bringing the whole of the Batinah Coast under subjection. Man-of-war visit to Barkah will certainly cause temoorary, If not permanent, abandonment of above plan which would probably have been carried out had not this visible oroof been given of our determination to suoport(°y support Sultan on coast where British interests also exist.(3 Moral effect on-Dartaoi/th*s* visit may also enable Sultan to exact terms of oeace from Imam, Sultan reminded me recently In conversation that his present difficulties were due to establishment of arms warehouse and sunnression of Arms Traffic and he asked whether our trooos could he sent to Nakhal against rebels. Guided by Government of India telegram to Secretary of State of 22nd July 1913 serial Uo.69, I reolied in the negative, and in asking for man of war I was also guided by the principle therein laid down, encouraged by sympathy of Sheikhs of Batinah which he is said to command, Imam should advance to distract peace of province, it is doubtful whether Sultan could oppose him unaided. Question of assisting him will arise. He asked me recently how It was all to end 1 ^ he could not hope for assistance of British troops, T suggest one remedy failing peaceful negotiations with Imam was establishment of disciplined corps of his own.

He reports that mine in Samad was fired at daybreak 19th July and it blew up the well- tower and the privy which 1 understand are in south corner. Screen wall has, however been constructed by Syad Nadir during the siege and this apparently holds, though interior of fort is now exposed to fire from the high ground opposite south face. There is still a well which can be approached by night time for the need of garrison, ft is now suggested that rebels will try another mine, and that after this catastrophe Syad Nadir cannot possibly hold out fortnight. In my ‘ Philomel ’ telegram 1 mentioned proposed occupation of Wadi Aththabaun, and now another letter has been leceived from Panijabar saying Isa Pin Saleh has forestalled them. This points to treachery on the part of Panijabar and to understatement of Isa’s forces. Nadir also in a recent letter complains that many of his followers’ rifles are out of order. Sheikh Peshid Pin Azzaiyiz brought me this news and letters, he states he and Syad Timur had endless discussion with Pam-bu-ali persuading them to Sib and he despairs of situation except with the aid of British Government.”From Viceroy, \2&gt;th April 1914.

I cannot consult the Sultan regarding the pos sibility of reduction of troops as he is now away. It is true that Dohit aie doing^nothing.

On the 17 th His Highness the Sultan left for Sib in the “Nur ui Bahr. ^ l he same day His Highness’ steam-cutter w r as despatched to Kuraiyat.. to enquire into a case of robbery from the shop of a British subject. She re turned on the 18th and the “ Nur ul Bahr,” with His Highness onboard, on the -L t/LIl# 573. This Kuraiyat incident is a curious one and we have not yet arrived at the truth of the affair. A reference is invited to item No. 382 of this diary for the week ending the 13th September, when it was reported, in all good faith, that an askari of the WAli of Kuraiyat had shot dead a Bedouin of the Bani Battash. r lhe Bunniah whose shop has recently been looted bv the Bani Battash under the leadership of a certain Shaikh Sultan bin Muhammad bin Shamaz, puts his loss at 815,000 of w hich 84,000 are his property, while the balance belong to influential Bunniahs of Maskat and Matrah This Bunniah, Jairam i anji, is the principal Bunniah of Kuraiyat and he has had in his service for the past four years a Balueh, Abdulla bin Muhmmad Hoti, who is practically a native of Kuraiyat and has been in Hindu service, though not in that of Jail am Nanji, lor many years. There was some trouble in August between this Baluch agent and a Bedouin of the Bani Dhakar and the Baluch is re- poited to have struck the Bedouin, but this fact has only been elicited from Jairam Nanji after close cross-examination. Again, as reported in September, there was the affray between the Wali’s askari, now reported to be a Hadhrami who has since been discharged, and the Bani Battash, According to Jairam Nanji, the affair was trifling; the Wali sent the askari to demand tribute of a Battashi and, if he refused, to bring him to the YY ali’s barza in Kuraiyat. The Battashi did refuse and loaded his gun amd said that he would shoot if interfered with. On this the askari returned to the YVali, Avhen the fort Avas put into a state of defence, the Wali thought matters sufficiently menacing to come and report in person to his late Highness Sir Saiyid Faisal and the British subjects of Kuraiyat came in a body to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul to ask for protection. It will be seen that this report differs materially from the rumours current in Maskat in the middle of September. At an interview with Saiyid Taimur on the morning of the 21st f: \ 31 JAM 914 'V h &amp; India, Foreign Secretary's No 3 M, dated .15' JAM 1914mrnmmmmm 2 December, His Highness stated that he had never heard that an askari of Kuraiyat had shot a Battashi and attributed the unrest among the Bani Battash to the machinations of the rebels, who had told the Bani Battash some time ago that they were not to attack Kuraiyat in the absence of orders from the rebel chieftains. Saiyid Taimur added that Muhammad bin Shamaz was buried in the floor of the palace, as he had been executed when the Bani Battash were giving trouble in his late father’s reign. The Political Agent cannot help thinking that neither the Bunniah nor His Highness have been quite candid in this question of the Bani Battash and that high handed conduct on the part of underlings of the Kuraiyat officials may be the true reason of the unrest there. Jairam Nanji has been instructed to bring his account books at Maskat and prepare a careful list, which will be checked by independent Hindu merchants of the looted property, the value of which has probably been greatly exaggerated. 574. While this K^iraiyat incident shows great weakness and insecurity close to Maskat, complaints have recently been pouring in from the British subjects, again Hindu Bunniahs, residing at Suwaiq. They complain of the in action of the Wali Salim bin Sa’id who declares his inability to do anythin°- to recover claims due from the Ayal Saad or from the Arabs of Rustaq The Political Agent, at the interview referred to, urged His Highness to send some j person of trust and influence to enquire into matters there and pointed out that these reports from two different directions would naturally suggest to the I British Government the inference, at a somewhat critical juncturer that His Highness’ authority was crumbling away altogether. Both Kuraiyat and Suwaiq have hitherto been regarded as outside the rebel sphere of influence. 575. With reference to entry No. 559, Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid and his brother Sagar and Salim bin Aamir, Shaikh of the Bani Bu Hassan, and their followers returned to Maskat with His Highness the Sultan. The Sultan intends to send Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid back to Abu Thabi in the “Nur-ul- Bahr ” whence he will return by land in about a month’s time, according to His Highness’ expectations. “A Paque ou a la Trinite” would probably be nearer the mark. His Highness reports that the rebel leaders are quarrellino* \ among themselves and that Isa bin Saleh’s visits to Maskat has been regarded by the other rebels with great suspicion, and this is probably true enoughrbut a serious settlement or break up of the rebellion must be regarded as distant as ever. ‘V S.

One version says that Hmniyar and As-Salami demand the cession of the customs of Maskat and Matrah when they will serve Saiyid Taimur, who can remain on as Sultan.

The Janebah Shaikhs of Sur have written to Saiyid Taimur to say that Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir Ar-lliyami visited the Bani Bu-Ali of Ja’alan and sent messengers to the Janebah to persuade them to join the rebel cause, but that they finally replied that their loyalty to Saiyid Taimur was unchanged. 497. Saiyid Taimur also forwarded to the Political Agent a letter dated 5th instant from the Chief of Ja’alan, Ali bin Abdulla bin Salim Al-Hamudah. It is to the effect that Hamyar visited them and declared his firm resolve to attack Maskat and desired that Bani Bu-Ali should remain neutral, hut that they told him that they could try and get some concessions for him from the Saiyid, but on no account excuse themselves from helping the Saiyid, with their lives and property, if need he. 498. A simultaneous communication from the Wali of Sur informed Saiyid Taimur of the failure of Hamyar to get the Bani Bu-Ali and the Janebah to join the rebels and assures him of their steadfast loyalty to Saiyid Taimur, who, the W’ali suggests, should visit Sur, though for one day only, to discuss the situation there and to reassure the Janebah and the Bani Bu-Ali. 499.

He said that sedition had not reached thnt village and that, although the emissaries of the Imam had arrived there the Shaikhs of his part ot the country would not respond. ’ 468. It then transpired that the main ohiect of Hamaid’s visit was that after the coming Id he wanted to hire a boat from The Harinah Coast fn which to return with his attendants and some merchandise, apparentlv dates to his own country, and as he was assured in his own mind that the rebels would M l Sl f an u d Matrah either just before or after the /7 he wanted to be furnished with a kind of pass or safe conduct to ensure him gainst interference from the British troops or man-of-war that mio-ht ImL-o measures aga nst such rebel attack.

He found that Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir of the Bani Riyam had written to the Janebah Shaikhs telling them to send two of their number to him to arrange for his visit to the sons of the late Amir of Ja’alan. The Janebah Shaikhs, however, replied that they were obedient to Shaikh Taimur, and that if he tried to come with force, he would be opposed with force. 473. The “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” found one Hamaid bin Salim bin A’amir, an influential headman of the Bani Bu-Hasan at Sur, and he asked for a passage to Maskat, as he wished to see Saiyid Taimur. He was allowed to come, but Saiyid Taimur now intends to dismiss him to his home, as other important Shaikhs of the Bani Bu-Hasan are on their way, and the Saiyid does not desire too many Bedouins to assemble in Maskat. ******* 480. The “ Al-Amran ” of Cairo in its issue of 4th October 1913 write 8 on the present situation of Oman, praising His late Highness Sir Saiyid Eaisal bin Turki for his sincere desire for the welfare of his subjects and the cordial relations of the Sultanate with the British Government whb’h ensure peace and prosperity to the country. The writer concludes by hoping that the present rebellion, which is based on the poisonous teachings of ignorant Mullas, will soon be at an end, and that every Arab who has any voice in Oman will rise up to suppress this evil before retribution follows.Telegram P., No. 64, dated the 10th November 1918.

Sir, Maskat Affairs. H. M. S. “ Fox ” at Maskat; 16th September 1913. In continuation of my letter No. 13 M., dated the 9th September 1913, I have the honour to report that H. M. Ship “ Fox ” left Maskat on the night of 12th September with Major S. G. Knox, Political Agent, on board, for the purpose of ascertaining the state of affairs prevailing along the Batinah coast. Four piaces were visited (Barka, Sohar, Al Khadhra, Suwaik) and the inhabi tants were found to be, generally speaking, contented and peacefully inclined towards His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. 2. At Suwaik a native had some months previously been fined 2,400 rupees for damage, by collision, to a dhow belonging to a British subject. This native was, at a solemn pow-wow on 14th instant, ordered to make repara tion and informed that, if no satisfactory answer was received from him within one hour, his own dhow, hauled up on the flat above high water line, would be launched, sent round to Maskat and sold. No reply having been received at the end of the hour, arrangements were made for launching the dhow in question. Officers and men to a maximum of 120 were landed throughout the afternoon and night of Sunday, the llth, and at 7-30 A.M., on 15th instant, the dhow took the water. Unfortunately she was found to leak so badly as to put out of question the practicability of her being towed anywhere. She was consequently left moored close to the beach, and when '‘Fox’* left Suwaik at 4 a.m., on 16th instant, was in a practically waterlogged condition. 3. As regards the condition of affairs in the environs of Maskat, I under stand that a definite peace agreement between the Sultan and Imam has not yet been effected, but that the rebel troops are gradually dispersing and that the probability of an attack on Maskat is now extremely remote. 4. As the necessities of the case will now be amply met by “ Fox M remaining within one day’s steaming distance, I propose visiting Jashk and Lower Persian Gulf Ports as convenient.

On his accession, Saiyid Taimur-hin-Faisal wrote letters to all the Shaikhs and tribal headmen of Oman informing them of his assumption of the Sultanate of Maskat and Oman and giving assurances of a just and equit able rule and of his desire to reform the administration of the country at large. 456. He is receiving communications, in reply, generally containing expressions of sympathy and assurances of loyalty from most of the Chiefs, notably Shaikh Isa-bin-Salih Al-Harithi, Hamad-bin-Hilal-bin-Hamad of the Ya’l-Saa’d, Saif-bin-Hilal, Hamad-bin-Ali, Muhammad-bin-Saif and Abdullah- bin-Said-bin-Khalfan of Wadi Samail; Hamad-bin-Said-bin-Hammad of the Bani Bawaha, Hamad-bin-Aamir Al-Hinai of Khoz; Said-bin-Abdullah, Muhammad-bin-Mubarak Al-Janebi and others of Sur and many others of less note. 457. Saiyid Taimur also received letters from Shaikh Mohsin-bin-Zahran As-Siyabi and Shaikh Saud-bin-Ali to the effect that the rebels are preparing to advance on Maskat, but that Shaikh Isa bin Salih Al-Harithi is well disposed towards Saiyid Taimur, whom the writers advise on that account to make terms with the Imam through the Harithi Shaikh. On the other hand, ft is reported that the three chief rebel-leaders, the Imam As-Salimi and Hamyar are now openly at variance among themselves and cannot at all agree as to what they should do.Disturbances.

The Imam and Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi have written to Saiyid Taimur exhorting him to abide by and enforce the Shara orders and to administer justice in the country. These would appear to point to a weakening of the spirit of rebellion and a desire for reconciliation. 439. The Political Agent also received communications from the above persons asking that they may be let alone by Government to settle their dis putes with their ruler and that the troops may be recalled, as they, the leaders, undertake the responsibility of protecting British and other foreign subjects and their properties. 440. News has been received from Sohar that one of the Maghrabi Askaris forming the garrison there, whose pay was partly withheld, shot the Akid killing him immediately. A relation of the Akid who was there shot the murderer dead at the same time. 441. It is reported from Barkah that two State camels in charge of the Wali of Barkah have been stolen by some of the tribesmen of the neighbour hood. • *«*•** 443. On the 5th, the Sultan’s Yacht “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” left for Quryat returning on the 7 th. 444. On the 6 th, H.M.S. “ Fox ” arrived with the Resident on board and is still in harbour. ****** « 449. The funeral of the late Sultan, Sir Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki, G.C.I.E., took place on the 6 th instant. The Janazah was borne from the palace at 8 a.m., and the funeral was attended by a very large number of the inhabitants as well as British Indians and other foreigners. Of the Government and others the following were present:—The Political Agent with his staff, Colonel Edwardes, Commanding 102nd Grenadiers, accompanied by Lieutenant Christie, Adjutant, Colonel Smith, Commanding 2 nd Rajputs, accompanied by Captain Griffiths, Adjutant, the Agency Surgeon, Clerk in Charge Telegraphs and Jemadar of the Maskat escort. The French Consul and the American Vice and Deputy Consuls were also present. 450. On the 6 th, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by the Political Agent, paid a visit of condolence to the sons and other members of the family of the late Sultan. Only Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Turki, hall- brother of the late Sir Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki, was absent from this and other functions after the burial. 451. On the 8 th October 1913, at 11 a.m., after the three days of mourn ing for the late Sir Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki were concluded, Saiyid Taimur-bin- Faisal, accompanied by his brothers Saiyids Nadir, Muhammad, Hamad and Hamud and his cousin Saiyid Dhiyab-birnFahad and his first cousin once re moved, Ali-bin-Salim*bin-Dhuwaini, paid a visit to the Political Resident at the Agency. The following officials and notables of the Oman Government were also in attendance:—Saiyid Hamud-bin-Azzan-bin-Qais Mutawwa’, Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Hamad, Wali of Matrah, Saiyid Saif-bin-Badar, Saiyid vvr //w~v2 Hamud-bin-Hamad Rai Dhabiya, Saiyid Yusuf Az-Zawawi. A message of condolence from His Excellency the Viceroy to the family of the late Sultan was conveyed by the Political Resident to Saiyid Taimur and his brothers. A verbal message was sent later to Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Turki informing him that he had been included in the above message of condolence and that ^ the Resident regretted that neither Saiyid Muhammad himself nor any of his ^ children was present to hear it. The Resident was assured by those of the family present that they were ready to acknowledge Saiyid Taimur as their Sultan and head and that they were ready to give him full and loyal support. 452. On the 8 th October 1913, Saiyid Taimur held a durbar which was attended by the local notables at which he announced his accession. No ? Foreign Government was there represented. The accession seems to be accepted by all present at Maskat without opposition of any kind except from His late Highness’s brother, but it seems not unlikely that he too will shortly submit to the inevitable. It is rumoured that the principal objection now remaining is the increase of the allowances he received from his late brother from $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per month. Saiyid Taimur appears to think that $ 1,500 should suffice, but will probably accept his uncle’s figure in , return for full support. I 453. Saiyid Taimur appears to have grasped the reins of Government firmly and to be inclined to work through his brothers, Saiyid Nadir and Muhammad and his cousin Dhiyab-bin-Fahad-bin-Turki. Great reforms are promised, especially in the Customs; public smoking and drinking are to be prohibited and prostitutes are to leave the town, the local authorities at Matrah have received warnings against the taking of bribes and justice has been promised to high and low. Most of these reforms are in deference to the presumed wishes of the Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi, one of the moving spirits of the rebellion.Telegram P., No. 1677—12 M., dated the 20th October 1913.

Ships and Vessels, East Indies. I have the honour to report that the present position of affairs at Maskat is as follows:— 2. The ardour of the rebels massed in the vicinity of Samail has been much reduced owing to the presence of H. M. ship “Fox” and of the large contingent of Indian troops effectually guarding all the approaches to Maskat. 3. Yesterday (8th) the Imam (rebel leader) sent to the Sultan request ing the presence at Samail of an ambassador to discuss terms of peace. The Sultan s delegate left yesterday for Samail, and some sort of peace agreement is expected to be signed in the course of this week. The general opinion here is that this “ peace ” will vanish with the British troops. 4. I am in course of communication with the Political Resident, and unless he considers the presence of a man-of-war (in addition to the troops) to be essential, H. M. ship “ Fox ” will proceed to blockade and inspection duties as necessary.No. 182, dated Maskat, the 9th October 1913. From— Major S. G.

The translation of a third letter from the Shaikh, which, incidentally, contains a threat which I venture to think need not be taken too seriously, is also attached for your information. This letter arrived, while the reply, already referred to, was in course of preparation, and it has not been thought necessary to despatch any further communications to the Shaikh in respect thereof. 3. A copy of this letter, with its four enclosures, is being forwarded to the Hon’ble the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment. Sub-Enclosure No. 1. Translation of a letter from “the Imam of the Muslims, Salim-bin-Rashid Al-Kharusi and his companions, the Chiefs' to Major Knox, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, dated the 30th Shawal, 1331, corresponding with the 2nd October 1913. After compliments .—We inform your honour that the people of Oman have agreed by common consent to depose their Sultan, and have assembled to rise against him disliking the innovations he has brought about in Islam, by contravening the Shara commands and committing what is forbidden therein and setting the people against one another, and thereby disturbances are rife in the country and the order of things is disturbed, crimes have been committed, blood has been shed, property looted, legal punishments dispensed with and rights destroyed. Thereupon, the Muslims felt shame for the sake of their religion and were angered on account of what they saw of corruption. So they assembled and agreed on this happy rising-up and hope thereby to secure the reform of their country and people. And as this movement has culminated up to Wadi Samail, we understand that your honour have landed a party of your troops at Bait-al-Falaj and its vicinity. We considered this matter and feared lest there should be a collision between us and you. We pondered over our situation and forbade the tribes to attack, and ordered them to protect your subjects. They obeyed as they needs must obey. All this was done out of regard for your Government and a solicitude to maintain our mutual friendship. By God ! we have not delayed (an attack) on any account except this. Further, we understand that letters have been forged as from us which would cause hatred and ill-will, but an2 untruth like that cannot he concealed from the like of your honour. And it is hoped from your honour that the troops will be removed from Maskat and its neighbourhood, and, God willing, you will have faithfulness (on our part) as soon as may be. This is written by their order by Muhamm^ As*Salimi, with his hand. Certified that this is from the Imam of the Muslims, Salim-bin-Rashid Al-Kharusi, with his hand. Seal of Imam. Knox, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, dated the 30th Shawwal, 1331, corresponding with the 2nd October 1913. After compliments ,—It is stated to your honour that you may he acquaint ed with, and informed of, the fact that the entire Arab community of Oman, from Katar to Maskat, has agreed upon setting aside its former Sultan, Paisal- bin-Turki, and has installed a new Sultan for itself, and has secured from him bonds and pledges for the welfare of the country, peace for the people, and compliance with the Bright Code as enforced by the Unitarian Islamic teach ings. And as regards yourself, it is requested of your Government to desist from interfering in this important affair and to stick to the zone of separation in accordance with the known Law in relation to independent States and their autocratic Sultans, as France has done with us. And you will have loyalty on our part in the requirements of friendship and bonds of amity. And we think it impossible that the Great British Government should interpose between us and the reform of our country and be the sole cause leading to ruin and destruc tion and of creating ill-will against herself, for she is a wise Government and the only one w T hich has always been trying to uphold the rights of mankind. And your Government should not suppose that the people of Oman are stupid and ignorant Bedouins knowing no law and understanding nothing. They are, on tie other hand, an intelligent people who have gained experience of the world in every side, have tasted its sweets and bitters, known the causes of progress and civilization and understood the policies of powers as well as their tactics. And your Government should not think that this our rising is one for looting, extortion and murder, God fordid that it should be so ! On the other hand, it is a rising the object of which is peace for the country and happi ness for the people. It is, therefore, requested and hoped of your Govern ment that her troops will be moved from Bait-al-Falaj and entirely removed early. If these w r ere brought for the protection of your subjects, then we undertake the responsibility of protecting their lives and property. God willing 1 And we do not think that your Government, which is well-known for her diplomacy and considerate treatment, will prefer one individual to two millions of Arabs and will dash their freindship and love which is greater for her than for any other Government against the wall as useless. The Arab community thinks her above that and that she is far too noble to suffer such a thing from which your Government will reap nothing but loss of lives and the flowing of gutters of blood on the surface of the earth. And a reply is requested from you immed ; .tely. This is from the representative of all, xlbdullah-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi. Written by his son Muhammad with his hand. Certified that this is from the Imam of the Muslims, Salim-bin- Kashid Al-Kharusi, with his own Land. Seal of the Imam. (Sub-Enclosure No. 3.)

Translation of a letter from t( the Arab Community of Oman and its new Sultan” to Major3 my Government and will no doubt receive their wise consideration. By this time, however, you have no doubt heard of the death of our friend, Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki, who has now appeared before a Higher Judge than your selves and us and all it would ill be seem any of us to presume to pronounce an opinion on the merits or demerits of his past life. You say with truth that the Great British Government loves justice and peace, and you may be sure that the great desire of that Government is that there should be concord and a good understanding between the Kulers and the subjects of Oman. It has been a source of gratification to me to note from friendly com munications which our friend Saiyid Taimur has shown me that the pillar of the Abadhi religion, Shaikh Abdulla-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi, has not ceased to offer him counsels of wisdom and humanity, and this encourages me in the hope that the clouds which have unfortunately arisen between the people and the ruler in the latter days of Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki may be dispelled and the tribes may at no distant date reach a good understanding with his successor. {Sub-Enclosure No, 4.) Translation of a letter from 'the representative of the Arab community and her new Sultan ” t to Major Knox, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, dated the 5th of Dhil Qada 1331, corresponding with the 6th October 1913. After compliments .—We inform your honour that the news of death of the deposed Sultan reached us yesterday, and no information has reached us from you in that connection. And you are aware that the community has deposed him a long time before his death and rose against him on various occasions the last being this present rising which we hope will be auspicious, and we pray to God that He may complete his blessing on us and consummate His light for us. And we have previously sent you letters, dated the 30th Shawwal, as we had not seen the new moon which we realized afterwards thus the date should be 1st Al-Qa’ada. The subject matter of those letters being that we have not arisen but to protest against the innovation brought about by the despotic Sultan in the shedding of blood and setting the tribes one against the other, the disregard of privileges and omission of prescribed penalties and the weakening of the Shara’ commands, and thereby disturbances arose among the people. There upon the nation felt ashamed for the sake of its religion and angered on account of bloodshed and (loss of) property. So, it assembled in this auspicious assemblage the news of which has reached you. Then we heard that you landed a party of your troops at Bait-al-Falaj, but we disliked to attack fearing lest there should be a collision between us whereby the means of friendship would be ended. So we wrote to you about this, but have not received a reply, and God knows if the letters reached you. If you have landed that party for the protection of your subjects, we have undertaken the responsibility of protecting them, and it will be our duty, God willing, to protect the subjects and their property, be they of any nationality whatever. And you have known that we have not come forward to create disturbance on the earth, so when this our letter reaches you, remove your troops, as we are, I God willing, coming on the track of the letter in order to take what there is there of the Arab kingdom. And we are responsible for the protection of your ‘ interests as well as those of others. And reply is requested by hand of the messenger who bears this.

Enclosure. Extract from Maskat News for the week ending the 4th October 1913. Condition of the country .— 424. Letters received during the week by His Highness the Sultan from the interior indicate that the rebellion is weakening. Shaikh Hamyar-bin- Nasir is said to be lukewarm, finding that supporting a rebel army is expen sive. There is also a general feeling among the people that they are more j heavily taxed under the new regime and the rebel leaders cannot agree. 425. The Wall of Sur reports that the rebels are planning an advance on that port under Shaikh Isa-bin*Salih Al-Harithi. The Wali of Sur seems alarmed and is strengthening the fort of Sur and the neighbouring towers and asking for fresh supplies of ammunition from Maskat. 426. It is further reported by the Wali of Sur that the Shaikhs of Sharqiyah are now inclining towards the Imam for whom they are trying to raise funds by disposing of Waqf properties at Bidiyah and elsewhere. It seems probable, however, that these reports are due to a desire to obtain more ammunition from the Sultan. 427. The Jannabah Shaikhs of Sur have written to His Highness assuring him of their loyal support and defence of Sur in case the rebels attack that port. ******* 433. On the 1st, His Highness the Sultan’s yacht “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” left for Dil, Khabura, with forty men of the Bani Umar and arrived on the 2nd. ******* 437. The health of His Highness the Sultan has given cause for the gravest anxiety. During the week, his illness has rapidly gained upon him and he became unconscious on Friday evening. On Saturday morning, a woman of the household, entering his bedchamber, gave a false report to the harem that His Highness was dead and the usual lamentations, customary in this country on the news of death, broke forth and lasted sufficiently long for the shops to be closed and all work in town and harbour to cease before the alarm could be contradicted. His Highness remained unconscious ail Saturday and the end may be expected any moment. Major Little, the Agency Surgeon, and Major Corrie Hudson, I.M.S., D.S.O., of the 2nd Rajputs, are in constant attendance. Later. His Highness the Sultan died at 7 P.M., on Saturday evening, the 4th October.AUP 1 INDIA OFFICE LIBRARY AND RECORDS Photocopying record Ref No IOL: IOR Date Name Process No of exposures 1 1 2 17 3 4 5 6 REFER 1 fO THE SPECIALIST CONCERNED IN PSB2</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000140_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/425</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000140</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/425</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 4684/1913 'Pt 1 Muscat rebellion'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1913/1914</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-06-07T22:01:45</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (162 folios)</extent><extent>The subject 4684 (Muscat Rebellion) consists of three volumes, IOR/L/PS/10/425-427, with part 1 comprising the first volume, part 2 comprising the second volume, and parts 3 and 4 comprising the third volume.The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 160; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located at the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
