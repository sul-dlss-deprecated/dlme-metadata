S ir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 47, dated the 4tli March 1901, forwarding estimates of initial and recurring expenditure necessary to place the Bahrein Agency on a permanent footing. 2. The modified estimates as detailed on the margin are provisionally sanctioned, subject to the approval of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. The Government of India are not pre pared to grant more than Rs. 20,000 for the Assistant Political Agent's house including furniture for the reception rooms; the plans and estimates forwarded with your letter No. 6, dated the 7th January 1901, should he revised so as to he in accord with this limit. Local material should, if possible, be used for the construction of the house. The boat and fittings to be provided for the Vice- Consul at Bunder Abbas have been estimated* to cost Rs. 600 only, and a similar sum is sanctioned under this head for the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein. A recurring expenditure of Rs. 115 has been allotted for liveries, on the understanding that the supply will be regulated according to the scale sanctioned for the Bushire Residency. 3. The suggestion made in your letter No. 47, dated the 4th March 1901, that the medical officer attached to the Arabian Mission House at Bahrein should be retained for attendance on the Assistant Political Agent and his establishment on a remuneration of not more than Rs. 50 a month, is sanc tioned.

B am to say that the best way of supplying you vjith funds would be to divide the allotment of Rs 20,000/- into even instalments of advance-say of Rs 4,000/-or Rs 5,000/ each As funds were required you could send us a receipt for each instalment and we could then avranae either to remitthe amount as specie or / hy means of a &lt; up ply Fill on Bombay in your favour, r -uch a Bill,it is believed, would find a ready sale in Bahvein, if offered at par. I am accordingly to invite an expression of your o \ opinion as to whether the course proposed will meet with the requirements of the case, and whether Supply on Bombay Bills of this Treasury could be readily disposed of in bah rem.

FURTHER EXPENDITURE ON ACCOUNT OP THE CONSTRUCTION OP THE AGENCY BUILDING AT BAHREIN. No. 166, dated Bushire, tbe 6th December 1902. From— L ieutenant -C olonel C. A. K emball , I.S.C.^ Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram dated 15th May 1902, on the subject of the Assistant Political Agent's house at Bahrein, I have the honour to report that the house has now been completed; the sea wall and wall round the building have been finished and the flagstaff has been erected. 2. I greatly regret to have to report that it has not been found possible to complete the works within the amounts sanctioned at various times by the Gov ernment of India. The amount originally sanctioned by Government was E20,000, which sum was to include the cost of furniture for the house. In my letter No. 7-, dated 31st March 1902, I had to apply for a further grant of B3,0()0, which sum the Assistant Political Agent estimated at that time would suffice to enable him to complete the house. This amount was sanctioned by the Government of India, who were also pleased to accord their sanction to the expenditure of a further sum of E2,480 for certain extra works not provided for in the estimate for the house. It will thus be seen that a sum of 1125,480 was sanctioned by Government for the house and furniture and the extra works alluded to above. The Assistant Political Agent has now reported in his marginally noted letter (copy of which is herewith sub- No. 220, dated 20tii Octo er 1902. mitted) that the sanctioned amount has not proved sufficient and has been exceeded by the sum of R4490, for which as well as for the sum of El,500 for furniture, or R5,990 in all, the sanction of Government is now solicited. 3. During my recent visit to Bahrein I inspected the works and am of opinion that they have been very well done, and that credit is due to Mr. Gaskin for the care taken by him to see that the work was properly done. So far as the construction of the house goes, there is no doubt that an excellent result has been achieved, and I can confidently assert that the money has been economically expended. I trust that the Government of India will understand the difficulties which are in the way of framing reliable estimates in a place like Bahrein, where both workmen and materials have to be imported from outside, where rates are con stantly varying, and where no one has the experience to be gained only by similar building work for his guidance. It is evident to me now that the mistake as regards this house occurred when the plan was made. I now see that a house of this size could not have been constructed within the estimate framed at the time, and I greatly regret that I did not then considerably curtail the size and numbers of the rooms. I had no experience then of building work, and such local assistance as I was able to obtain for the purpose of checking the rates was of little use. In conclusion, I can assure the Government of India that the house which has now been provided for the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein is a very good one and is well worth the money which has been expended on it. The vouchers forwarded by the Assistant Political Agent have been returned to him for certain corrections and will be submitted to the Comptroller, India Treasuries, shortly. E—10-11—Feb.—1753 F. D.Construction of the Agency building at Bahrein. No. 220, dated Bahrein, the 20th October 1902. From— J. Calcott Gaskin , Esq., Assistant Political Ag-ent, Bahrein, To—The First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bnshire. I have the honour to forward herewith, in duplicate, the building account of the new Agency up to the 28th July 1902, with vouchers, showing the ex penditure up to that date was R25,552-11-9, which is H73-11-9 iu excess of the original and supplementary grants of £25,480. I would venture to report that the sums granted by the Government of India have proved insufficient to complete the building, and as it was impossible for obvious reasons to suspend operations and there being no competent person to iudge accurately the probable cost of finishing the house, it was considered best to proceed therewith and carry on to a point at which it is possible to estimate what will be required to complete the building. Up to the 18th instant 113,790 have been expended beyond the amount given in the account and a further sum of R700 will be required. I would therefore respectfully request that the situation may be explained to the Government of India and an application be made for another grant of Bi,490 to complete the building and Kl,500 for furnishing the public reception rooms. I would beg to explain that the masons in the first instance grossly under estimated the amount of Gatch and labour required to complete the premises, also that they overlooked the necessity of employing lime with the Gatch for plastering the building to withstand the climatic conditions of Bahrein and the number of rafters also was found to be insufficient and the quantity of clay was underestimated by 2,000 loads. Paving the house and lower rooms absorbed a greater amount of stones, labour and Gatch than was calculated upon, and when plastering the Louse, it was found necessary to use sweet water for mixing the Gatch, as the well on the premises is impregnated heavily with mineral salts destructive to binding qualities of Gatch. The expenditure on the extra works have not been exceeded and the extra works are completed, except the sea wall which requires about E200 more to finish it and is included iu the figure mentioned above, as this sum was absorbed by the building. The flagstaff has been removed and will be erected during the current week. The roof of the house is being covered with clay, and there remains only the plastering of the facing of the plinth of the basement and the sea wall as stated above.

Kemball, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to reply to your letter No. 166, dated the 6th December 1902» requesting sanction to a further expenditure, aggregating R5,990, incurred on account of the construction of the Assistant Political Agent's house at Bahrein. 2. The expenditure is sanctioned on the understanding that the total amount now sanctioned is not again exceeded.Ill foreign Office to Sir F. 0'Conor. TTo: 83. S.th March 1905. Sir^ The Turkirh Anbassador made to me today a statement to the follovlng effect;- The Vali of Busscrah had telegraphed that two British ships of war had arrived at Bahrein and had anchored the one between Bussorah and Manama and the other opposite the latter place at which the construction of a guard house had been commenced. As this locality was in the Sandjak of TTejd and formed an integral part of the Ottoman iumpire, any encroachment would infringe the rights of the Imperial Government and wou1d be contrary to Treaty• Musurus Pasha was instructed to request that n.-M. Govern ment would give orders for the cessation of the work 04 which had been commenced. _l am, ebc. ^ (^d) (Omitted). Annexr / Annex s i^oreign Office to Sir Is T , 0'Conor. I\ T o; 39. 15th March 1905. Sir, The Turkish Ambassador told me today, with re ference to his conversation with me on the 3th instant, that the building which war said to have been erected by the order^ of the officers commanding the British 'hips which had lately visited Bahrein had been put up, not on the island of that name, but on the mainland opposite Manama. Thi r ' country formed part of the Turkish empire, and the Turkish Government regarded the erection of the buildings upon it as wholly unjustifiable. j- am, etc., (Unsigned).No. 144, dated Bushire, the 19th (received 28th) March 1905, From—' Captain A. P. Tebvob ,, I,A., for Officiating Political Eegident in th« Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department telegram, dated 1st instant, on the subject of accommodation to be provided for the Native Infantry guard stationed at Bahrein, I have the honour to forward a copy of letter j S o . 36, dated 11th Eebruary 1905, from the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, submitting estimates of cost for building the required quarters. 2. Availing himself of this opportunity Captain Prideanx has also sub' mitted estimates of cost for the construction of certain buildings, viz., houses for Government and private servants including sowars, stables and godowns. 3. The several estimates submitted by Captain Prideaux aggregate to Bs. 9,850, which I consider to be a moderate outlay for the proposed new buildings. I need hardly point out that in view of the changed status of our representative in Bahrein, and the consequent increase in the personnel of the Agency, the necessity for the proposed buildings will be apparent to the Government of India, and I accordingly trust that they will be pleased to sanction the estimated outlay, viz., Bs. 9,850. 4. During my recent visit to Bahrein the Sheikh presented the land required for building quarters for the Native Infantry guard and mounted orderlies, for the purchase of which a sum of Es. 500 was sanctioned by Government in foreign Department telegram, dated 1st March 1905. 5. The plan showing the position of the Agency house and of the proposed buildings is enclosed. No. 36, dated 11th February 1905. From—C aptain F. B. Peideaux , Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To — M a job P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to your letter No. 137, dated 30th January 1905, in which you inform me that the strength of my guard of Native Infantry has been fixed at 1 native officer and 24 sepoys, I have now the honour to address you on the subject of their accommodation. At the same time I take the opportu nity of pointing out that no stables or suitable quarters for my official and private servants exist. I therefore venture to hope that sanction for the construction of buildings for the latter purposes may be accorded to me at the same time. 2. I attach a plan showing the position of the Agency house. Hospital, Postmaster's Besidence and surrounding native buildings. The servants' quarters and stables can be conveniently built within the present limits of the Agency compound. There is no room, however, for the Infantry guard or mounted orderlies' quarters. I see, therefore, no alternative than to buy more land outside the Agency, and the only suitable plot is that immediately adjoin ing the compound on the western side. This ground is highly valued as it is situated on the sea-front, and I hear that its present owner paid the Chief of Bahrein a very high price for it partly for this reason, and still more on account of its vicinity to the Agency. The site of the Hospital compound— 34,38 : i square feet—cost Es. 840. 3. If 15,000 square feet are now bought and added on to the area of the Agency, the boundary will have a more regular appearance, the possibility of unpleasant shell-storing godowns—such as I am now threatened with—being built to windward of me is removed, and I shall have space available for the construction of houses for my ministerial officers, which is a step I propose to recommend as soon as the strength of my establishment, in regard to which I have already addressed you, is definitely settled.4' 4. The land which at present lies within the Agency walls including that on which the Postmaster's house stands, was given by Sheikli Isa to Govern ment free of charge, but having regard to the enhanced value which all the surrounding properties have now attained, I am doubtful of the wisdom of asking the Chief to give us this additional piece witbout compensation. I therefore solicit permission to negotiate for this land—iirst at the same rate as has been paid for the Hospital site, which works out at Us. 360, and if such an offer really appears to give dissatisfaction then to pay up to Rs. 500 for the site required. 4. My plan shows in red ink the external ground dimensions of the addi tional buildings which I desire to see constructed at once. The cost of eaoh building is estimated roughly as follows :— Native Officer's house and verandah Sepoys' barrack-room, bath-room aud kitchen . Sepoys' g-uard-room and strong room for Govtrnment Treasure chest, etc. Houses for 2 peons and 3 sowars Houses for 9 servants .

Captain Prideaux's report explains the matter fully, and it is unnecessary to comment beyond remarking that the complaint made by the Turkish Govern ment is as baseless as their other recent complaints. No. 161, dated Bahrein, the 19th May 1905. From— C aptain F. B. P rideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In reply to your letter No. 629, dated the 12th May 1905, on the subject of two^ communications made by the Turkish Ambassador in London to His Majesty s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, complaining of the erection of variously described buildings in the vicinity of Bahrein, but on Turkish territory 1 have the honour to report that no such infringements of Turkish rights have* been in any way committed. . . 1 2, '^ e com pl a int probably is founded on one or more of the three followinp 1 incidents :— 6 (I) In February last, after completion of the nautical survey of Khor Kaliya, the Commander of H. M. S. Redbreast caused a cairn or beacon to be built in the sea near Muharraq Island for the guidance of navigators entering the harbour. (II) In March, the Commander of H. M. S. Redbreast laid out a rifle- range and erected a stop-button the sandy desert at the south end u , nd ' one of the Bahr ein group, east of and adjacent to the chief island on which Manama is situated. In the construction of this range ^ no efforts were employed to give it a permanent character, but in a rainless climate such as Bahrein has, there is little doubt that the range will last for many years. No objections were raised by Sheikh Esain this connection. On the contrary he deputed an official to attend the camp and render all necessary assistance to the officer conducting the musketry practices. (iii) In February also, when I heard that an infantry detachment was on its way to Bahrein to act as Political Agent's guard, I commenced building a guard-room of the ordinary pattern close to the main entrance of the Agency house and within our own grounds. A barrack-room has still to be built, and for this the Chief has granted an additional site adjoining the west side of the Agency wall. 3. These are the only cases in which His Majesty's Naval Officers or myself have been connected with the construction of new buildings this year. The Victoria Memorial Hospital was started last year and cannot have any connection with this complaint. 4. I am inclined to think that the Turkish Ambassador, and possibly the Wall of Basrah too, have received indistinct accounts of recent events here i eCopy of a letter T 'p.2562-E.B,dated the 6th July 1905 from the Assistant Secretary to the G-oveminent of India in the Foreign department to the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf,Bushire• - MMMiM I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter T To.l44,. of Llarch 19,1905,submitting for approval estimates of the cost of the buildings required for the accommodation of the Agency guard at Bahrein as well as for certain other buildings. y It appears from your telegram of 16th June 1.905 that you cannot hold out any definite expectation that it will be possible to meet the expenditure by reappropriation from any other Agency under the Political Residency for the Persian Gulf. / 2, The G-overnment of India sanction the estimated out lay of rs.9,850/-but only on the distinct understanding that every effort is made to effect savings in the budget of the Persian Gulf.Residency or in that of one of the subordinate Agencies.

The Agency building was origin ally designed in this way to meet the local climatic con ditions, and it should be explained in greater detail why it is now proposed to alter the nature of the design by closing spaces which were left with a specific object. If these open spaces are open to objection, the house might have been designed in the first instance with small er plinth area and more convenience at less cost both in original outlay and maintenance, (il) Teak would be appropriate for a well built house in tended to last a long time but does not seem to be suit able for the Agency house at Bahrein. The Government of mdia consider that a material cheaper than teakwood or a material vmicn could be utilized again hereafter should be used for the proposed works, I am to enquire whether any other timber or material cheaper than teak is locally available. (ii.i)Io aias oeen suggested that the exposed verandah screens and weather shades might he formed of local plaster or dovetailed metal lathing or 'Etemit' or other fibro- cement tiles erected on light wooden frames.

At present the Assistant Political Agent is living in the house which was owned .and occupied 'by our late Agent, Agha Muhammad Rahim, This house is in a very 'bad condition, and I am of opinion after personal inspection that it is unsuitable for occupation 'by the British representative in Bahrein. The house might, I 'believe, be acquired 'by purchase from the heirs of the late Muhammad Rahim,'but I could, not recommend this course, as it would not 'be possible to repair the house so as to make a suitable dwelling, and I understand that the sum asked by the heirs for the house as it at present stands is prohibitive. There is no house available in Bahrein fit for occupation by the Assistant Political Agent, and I can only suggest tnat a nouse should be built by Government, i C, I have the honour to forward herewith plans and estimates for a nouse. These plans and estimates have been prepared by lu? Gaskfiin and I have had the estimates checked in Bushire with the result that 1 am satisfied with the correctness of the figures given by 1j? Gaskin, It will be seen that the house itself will cost Ps, &lt;50,155, This sum may seem large but it must be remembered that most of the j uilaing material lias oo oe imported, from Bushire from which place the masons and carpenters and a certain proportion of the workmen will have oo be sent. Consequently the cost of house construction in oanrein is consideraoly nigner than it is in Bushire, 5, My predecessor in his letter Ho. 128, dated 2ith September 1399 suggested tne sum of Ps, IS, 000/- as the cost of a house for oxie Political Officer at Banrein, I am not aware on what basis he made ohis estimate, but I believe it was on the consideration that• the late xilr Lucas, hctra Assistant to the Resident and Vice- Consul,built his house in Bushire for this sum. In this connection however it must be considered that the cost of building has in creased greatly of late years in Busilrp th / j ■-no t --. ^ xo in .uoxiire ana one nouse wnich I-Ir/ _* x y .-m Lucas 'built- for Es, 13,000/- some 24 yesurs a^o would cosu very much more ao the present time, C, y^iuiri regard, to the plans and estimates now submitted the climate o:f Bahrein and the conditions of existence there should 'be taken into consideration. The Bahrein summer is even more trying than one Busnire summer, and consequently a house with an upper story for the dwelling rooms of the Political Officer should be built: outside verandahs also are required., and the rooms should, be fairly lax £,o. Trie plan of one no use submitted by l.r Gas kin appears to me oo oe suitable. It might be possible to reduce the size of the rooms a little but this would not result in much saving of cost, and. ± do not think tnat the size of the rooms as proposed is un necessarily large, j Trie Chief of Sahrein lias expressed ills vflllinsness to make a free li- grant to Government of the site required but an embantanent will have to be built.

As you are aware under most peremptory orders from the Secretary of State in the direction of retrenchment, a scheme affecting all offices within the sphere of this Residency was submitted to Govern ment in August last, which is still under consideration, 2, If the Public Works Department officially confirm, on further enquiry, the view quoted in your letter that all or any of the al lotments at present sanctioned for the maintenance and repair of building in the Gulf are calculated at too meagre,rate, having re gard to local conditions, the position of all offices will be ex amined in this respect and, if the result so warrants, proposals for the recasting of such grants as seem to need it will be made to Government at a suitable opportunity, and with some hope of favour- aole consideration, i'or the present,however,I regret my inability oo support any applications for increases of allotments under heads of which the attendant permanent conditions have not altered since the retrenchment scheme above alluded to was submitted. I may mention that when the Bahrein grants were being dealt with in this office, it was the 200/- allowance for petty construc tion and- repairs that was reduced, and not the 200/- allotted for the 'Care and repair of the Victoria Memorial Hospital', -or the present I can only suggest that you should do the best you can to put the hospital in necessary repair from this allotment, and Wiat, If any abnormal and sudden damage from a hurricane or such other/cause has occurred, the reparation of which obviously cannot be met from your ordinary allotments, you should first endeavour to raise the amount by subscription and failing that ask for special sanctionworfc as quoted in the 1\ i 1 ^ ■ On tti 'the Agenc .3^ ■to 'the let 28th Septe Government Political Be fori -tained. in report, it has altered Captain Ma August 190!- Crulf, re qui of Rs:5,M? carry out (A).

The eliminiation of all these various items from the estimates naturally involves a large corres- —ponding reduction in the j^_continge^^iesIt now remains only to consider Item A« in greater detail, Liajor Prideaux, Captain Liackenzie and the present writer are all of opinion that the design approved by Major Prideaux will serve a great need and it is submitted, with great respect, that the criticism contained in para (i) of the Government of India's letter under report does not appl K v as the design of these double doors each double or triple- -folding would admit of their being thrown open in the hot weather, thus preserving the airy benefits of the original design # It seems advisable to repeat that these doors meet the needs of the cold weather as explained by Major Prideaux- The opinion is further expressed in the letter calling ior report that a cheaper material than teak wood should be utilised for the present works. It has been shown that feo a large extent cheap substitutes have been used in place of teak but it is respectfully submitted that the doors for which it is now proposed must be so carefully made and the warping to which inferior woods are in this alternately damp and dry climate with its excessive changes of tem- -perature so liable, would so entirely destroy their utility that any other material should not be utilized.
