The interior threat is considered to be the general situation in Persia and its difficulties in establishing administration within its own borders.Also discussed in the memorandum is the strength and skill of the Turcomanes (Turkmen) cavalry which could potentially disrupt Russia's plans in Asia and the lack of continuous British representation in Persia and the possible need to provide support to their ally in order to stop Russia from advancing through Asia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Russian Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000045#share">Unknown</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
