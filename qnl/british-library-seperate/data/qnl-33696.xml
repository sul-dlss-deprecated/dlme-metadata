The letter praises his intelligence, local knowledge, his sound handling of the post of Governor of Bussorah and his insight into the rulers of Arabia, Egypt and Syria. It further assures the government of his loyalty to the British and desire to assist the East India Company. The main purpose of the letter is to convey intelligence from Abdallah Aka concerning the Pacha of Baghdad, whom he believes will support the British in the event of a war with Turkey. However, he also believes that his ability to provide intelligence will be reduced as a result and details the services he can offer the British regarding the forwarding of packages and dispatches should such an eventuality come to pass.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100075534085.0x0000f0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
