Oth November, 1939. © Sir, Your Excellency will 'be aware that His Majesty 1 s Government have for some time had under consideration the question of granting compensation to the heirs of Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit and Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah for the losses suffered by the heirs since 1932 on account of Istihlak taxation on the produce of the estates in Iraq of these two Sheikhs, the tax-free possession of which was guaranteed to them by His Majesty's Government in 191k* 2c In the case of the Koweiti estates His Majesty's Government have been able to accept the figures submitted by the present Sheikh for losses in the years 1932-3 to 1936-7 o This provides a satisfactory basis for calculating the amount of compensation due to him and to his co-heirs&lt;, The method of calculation in this case has been to strike an average of the losses in the years mentioned above (£1,08?) and to multiply this figure by twenty, so as to give the Sheikh and the other heirs twenty years' purchase in respect of the future 0 The figure reached in this way has been rounded up to £22,000o It has also been decided that the heirs will be paid past proved losses for the seven years since 1932o The amount actually to be paid to them may, indeed, have to be slightly reduced owing to a /doubt Excellency •ir Basil Newton, K.CoMoGo, etc,, etc. , etc,, Bagdad,2) doubt having arisen as to whether the estates administered ^ ^ by Sheikh Iviubarak in 191k were all actually owned 'by him, and if it is established that they were not wholly owned by him it may be decided that the 1914 pledge only covers the estates of which he was the owner, as opposed to the administratorc No final decision on this point has yet been reached, but, whatever the decision is, it will not affect the estimated amount of the taxation losses on the Koweiti estates as a whole, although, as I have said above, it may lead to some reduction in the payment made to Sheikh Mubarak's heirso 3o tor the reasons given in Mr, Ogilvie—Forbes 1 s L despatch No«390 (202/13 /34) of 12th July, 193U, and Sir Archibald Clark Kerrs despatch No0^99 '(577/3/36) of the 7th October, 1936, it has not proved possible for His Majesty's Government to accept the similar figures for losses due to Istihlak taxation submitted by the administrator of the estates of Sheikh Khazalo Nor has it proved possible to devise any practicable means of reaching a satisfactory estimate of what these losses in fact have been. His Majesty's Government have, however, felt justified in concluding, from the estimates for the now abolished land tax made annually by the authorities in Iraq on the estates both of the Sheikh of Kov/eit and of Sheikh Khazal in the years preceding 1932. that the income from the latter was then,and may reasonably be assumed to have remained, a little less than half of that from the formerc Uo I realise that this is a method of estimating the losses on the . ohammerah estates which might not be acceptable in a Court of Law, but I do not regard this as ! • /a■a matter in which it is essential for legal forms to 'be strictly followed, provided that His Majesty's Government are themselves satisfied that the heirs of Sheikh Khazal are not 'being treated unfairly* in the case of the Sheikh of Kov/eit His Majesty's Government have a legal obligation, which is still in force, to a ruler whose goodwill is, incidentally, of considerable importance to them, I am advised, however, that the position with regard to the heirs of Sheikh Khazal is rather different. The promise made hy His Majesty's Government in 19I4 was a promise to the Sheikh of Mohammerah in his capacity as an independent ruler, and was legally dependent on his continuing to 'be soo The Sheikh is now dead and had indeed ceased to be an independent ruler before his death; and although His Majesty's Government regard themselves notwithstanding as under a moral obligation to pay fair compensation to the heirs this compensation is in their view in effect an ex gratia payment. They therefore think it unnecessary to negotiate with the heirs, and although it is no doubt desirabl to obtain if possible a complete discharge from each recipient in return for any payment made this is not stricbly speaking essential and it might be sufficient in practice to secure a receipt only, 5- In all the circumstances, therefore, I feel that the losses of the heirs of Sheikh Khazal can justifiably be assumed without further investigation to be less than half of those of the heirs of the Sheikh of Koweit, and the compensation to be paid to them has accordingly been fixed upon the basis that it should be as nearly as possible exactly half, subject to certain modifications in the /methodmethod of calculation ivhich the absence of any agreed figure as to actual losses in respect of Istihlak taxation since 1932 has rendered inevitalDle 0 The calculation has been made as follows: the assessed average annual loss on the Koweiti estates from 1932/33 to 1936/37 (£1,08?) has been divided by 2 and the resultant figure has been multiplied by 27 (20 years in respect of future losses and 7 years in respect of past losses since 1932)„ The total reached in this way is £1^,67^ 10o Oc , ^ 6. In his despatch Noe 612 of 31st December 1936, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr reported that there were in all 28 recognised heirs of the Sheikh of kohammerahc Of these 13 were sons and 1U were daughters and there was one widow. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr added that all the sons and daughters are entitled without exception to movable property and to mulk and mir^i property also# the sons&gt; however, receiving twice as much as the daughters^ The widow is entitled to movable and mulk property, but so far as mirj property is concerned she is entitled to trees and buildings but not to landc He went on to explain that in Ottoman Law the division of property amongst the heirs should be made in the following manner; after the widow f s share of 1/8 of the movable and mulk (immovable) property has been deducted, the remainder is split into UO shares, of v/hich each son is entitled to two shares and each daughter to one share. This position was confirmed by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran in his despatch Noo5k0 (133/17/36) of 25th December, 1936, As I have explained above. His Majesty's Government regard themselves as having a free hand in assessing and distributing the compensation to be made to the heirs in view of its ex grati a nature, and I do not consider it necessary /to(p to make any attempt to estimate whether the widow's share should he less than 1/3« It will, I think, 'be quite sufficient if her share is fixed at £1,83U* 6* 3«, or 1/8 of the compensation, (which may, however, 'be rounded up to £1,835) and if each of the sons receives £6U2e Oo 0. or 2/40 of the remainder and each daughter £321» 0* 0. or 1/kO of the remaindero 7o Subject therefore to any further observations which Your Excellency may wish to make, I shall be glad if you will now address a communication to each of the heirs, except Sheikh Ghassib, on the following lines• 8. You should start by saying that His Majesty's Government are prepared to make an ex gratia payment in full and final settlement of past losses due to Istihlak taxation since 1932 and of prospective future losses from this or alternative forms of taxation on land or produce» You should then inform each one of the amount which His Majesty's Government are prepared to pay as his or her share of the compensation due in respect of the estate as a whole, and should say that this payment will be made in each case if the heir concerned is willing to sign the following form of discharge: 'I e o o e .«o ^ do hereby acknowledge the receipt 'of the sum of £ , paid to me on behalf of His 'Majesty 1 s Government in the United Kingdom; and so far 'as my rights and interest in the estate of the late Sheikh 'Khazal of Mohammerah are concerned I accept this payment 'as a full settlement, binding eciually on me and my heirs / 'and'and assigns, of any claims which, as a result of the pledgb 'given to Sheikh Khazal of Hohammerah in 1911+, the heirs of 'Sheikh Khazal have made or may make upon His Majesty 1 s 'Government in the United Kingdom for the losses which Sheikh 'Khazal or they have suffered since 1932, or which they may 'suffer in the future, 'by reason of the Istihlak or any 'other tax hitherto or hereafter levied on landed property 'or agricultural production in respect of lands which they 'hold in Iraq as heirs of Sheikh Khazal'. 9e As and when each heir signifies his willingness to sign this receipt, arrangements should he made for him to do so in return for a cheque for the amount concerned, or, in cases where it is preferred, a letter notifying him or her that payment will 'be made into a specified hank in Iraq, Persia or the United Kingdom. 10. As you: are aware. Sheikh Chassih has an English wife who is living with her children in destitution in this country. His Majesty's Government regard it as very desirable that Sheikh Chassih should, if possible, he brought to make provision for this family. In his case, therefore, instead of saying that the money will he paid to him on his completion of the discharge, you should inform him that His Majesty's Government are prepared to pay the amount in question, hut consider that it is his duty to make provision for his family in the United Kingdom. They trust therefore that he will agree to his share of the compensation being paid direct to Mrs. Gladys Chassib. If he declines to notify his agreement to this procedure you should report to me for further instructions.. For your own information, His Majesty's /GovernmentGovernment may in that event decide to retain the mone^ indefinitely or to pay it to Mrs® Chassi'b without Sheikh Chassih s express consent. This is, however, a point on which no decision has yet 'been taken* llo It is possihle that some of 1 the heirs are reside'i in ±ersia, and you should in any such cases consult with Hi Majesty's Minister in Tehran, to whom a copy of this despat is 'being sen^ as 'Go the best method of communicating with them. 12c In conclusion, I would draw attentrLon to my despa NOo 13U of the 9th March in which Sir Maurice Peterson was instructed to inform the Iraqi Government, unofficially, of the intention of His Majesty's Government to make a payment to the heirs of Sheikh Khazal on account of taxation lossesc I am not aware whether an opportunity has yet occurred of making uhe proposed communication, hut in any case the Iraqi Government should be informed now of the sums that are beinp paido I am, with great truth and respect, Sir, Your Excellency 1 s obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) iSd.)

Ilf^ (T) T enclose herein a copy^rf 1 a despatch which J have sent to weld- porester at Basra. strictly- speaking the question of chassiVs intrigues to get back to Mohammerah are, I think, more the concern of the Residency at Bushire than of British Headquarters in Iraq or the ^embassy Bagdad, but it seemed so clear that chassiVs activities were in every way Undesirable that I thought it better to send him a warning at once and to avoid the delay which would result from following too closely the correct channels. tr 'r i/J .

Briefly, chasall) caused pamphlets to be distributed which purported to demand the aaalstance of the Arabs of Khuzlatan for the ByUlsh against their rerslan masters. Blnce then he Is reported to be sending agents from Basra to Persia and to be Instigating the local shaikhs. His plan is that they should combine in requesting the reinstalling of the family in Persia. According to Hi a vajesty^s vice Consul at 116 ('the consul) is recelrlng s great number of petitions from shaikhs on these lines. 5. jf is, of course, natural that the family should hope for re-instalinent, and it should be noted tliat three sons, shaikh 'Abd al Karlm, shaikh Abd al ^ajld and Bhalkh 'Abdullah hare dissociated themselves from this intrigue but have written P.A. offering their serwlce in any capacity. 4.

Holriian's despatch Ho.U2 of 18th \ember I sent for Shaikh Chasoib Khax'al to warn him against !e continuance of his intrigues in Khuzistan, Shaikh Chassib did not deny that he had distributed rohlets or that he had corresponded with certain Shaikhs, Re ntained however that his cole object had been to encourage ^ Arabs in their support of the British and that he himself b too old to try to regain his fathers position or return Khuzistan. He said that he would like to see the Arabs of uzistan freed from Iranian op; res si on but that he had pressly told thr, shaikhs not to ask for the reinstatement his family. In support of his statements he produced copies his pamphlets and of the letter he had written to the aikhs, which I enclose in translation and original. It was pointed out to Shaikh Chassib that however iinterested and pro~Br tiah he might considar his activities, #y in fact constituted an interference in Iranian politics ich could not be tolerated, and that unless he abandoned his trlgues in Khuzistan he would Incur the displeasure of His Jesty's Government, ^e assured me that his only desire fl been to serve the British cause and that he v ould aediately break off all relations with the Arab leaders in | uzistan and take care in future to conault the British thorities before taking any action. He promised moreover at he would make no attempt to enter Iran without the rraission of the British authorities, and his brothers have 1 made similar promises. No reliance can be placed in Chassib's aseurances t it is to be hoped that he is now convinced that further ^rigues will not be to his advantage.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to our conversation in Bahrain on the 7th of March and to enclose a copy of a note which I have recorded on my two visits from Shaikh Chassi'b, the eldest son of Shaikh Khazal, lately 4 Shaikh ^Mohommerah. 2. The interviews were most cordial and Shaikh Chasslb was at pains to 'be polite and insistant on his pro-British sympathies 'but 'bearing in mind his father's history I found them painful. I have made no reply to his requests other than to say that I would pass them on to you for such action as you considered possible and desirable. .BUSHjRE RESIDENCY. i our t:o.. 3 Date .//fyV.g... jircoaiT H I have the honour to 'be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. Major, Political Agent, Kuwait.Visit of Shaikh Ohassrb 'bin Khazal to Kuwait, March, 1942. I Shaiich Ohassi'b arrived here on the 3rd of March and called to see me on the morning of the 4th of March. He informed me that the Iranian Grovemment had 'by means of a notification published three and a half months ago in Iranian newspapers called for claims to property sequestered 'by the late Shah. These claims were to 'be lodged within six months of the date of publication of the notification, and Shaikh Chassis and eight other heirs, there are I believe twenty nine heirs in all consisting of fourteen sons thirteen daughters and two nephews of Shaikh Khazal, had telegraphed claims to the Iranian G-overnment prior to the issue of the notification whereupon Shaikh Chassib was instructed by that Government to lodge his claim to the Finance Minister aoi I am informed that this has been done. I understand also that some of Shaikh Ohassib sisters who were in Tehran when the ex-Shah abdicated lodged a claim immediately. Shaikh Chassib is more than doubtful of his family's claim succeeding unless His Majesty's Government will press the Iranian Government to make what restitution is practicably possible to the descendents of a man who was not treated by them and others with that consideration to which he was undoubtedly entitled. He stated that he had approached His Majesty's Ambassador in Baghdad, His Majesty's Consul^and various members of the C.I.0.1, but from each he had received a non-committal reply. He had asked permission to enter Iran personally to press his claims in Tehran but he had received no reply from the British Embassy in Baghdad. He approached the Iranian Consul in Basra and asked for a visa but was informed that he could not enter Iran unless he first surren dered his Iraq, passport and applied for an Iranian one. Shaikh Chassib drew my attention to the reputation which he stated/&gt;1 -2- ^ stated in his opinion Great Britain rightly enjoyed for fair dealing and mentioned Sir Percy Cox's letter dated the 21st November, 1914, and went on to remind me that Shaikh Khazal had died in Tehran probably from poisoning and that the family property both in Irantsa* and in Iraq, was no longer under the control of Shaikh Khazal's heirs. He then concluded by stating that Sir Percy Cox's letter was issued under instructions from the Government of India and he therefore appealed to them on his own behalf and that of his family to aid them. I said I would pass on his request to the Hon'ble the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf. 2 # On my return to Kuwait from Bahrain on the 10th of March I was surprised to find Shaikh Chassib still here and apparently awaiting my arrival. On the 11th of March His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait called to see me and in the i course of conversation mentioned that Shaikh Ohassib had asked his permission to go to Riyadh to ask Ibn Saud to take up his case with the British Government and that he, the Shaikh of Kuwait, had replied that naturally he could not object to his going to Eiyadh but that he must first obtain Ibn Saud's permission. Shaikh Chassib applied through Abdulla al Nafisi, the Saudi Government agent here, for permission to pay the visit but after some delay Abdulla al Nafisi was instructed to enquire for what purpose Shaikh Chassib wished to visit Riyadh and he accordingly did so. It seems that Shaikh Chassib then again consulted the Shaikh of Kuwait and stated that he particularly wished to see Ibn Saud as he had a document signed by the Shaikhs and leaders of Khuzistan calling on him to assume his fathers title and return to Khuzistan as their Shaikh and Ruler and he wished to enlist Ibn Saud's assistance to induce His Majesty's Government to permit him to do so. The Shaikh of Kuwait strongly advised him to give up all idea of going to Riyadh in person and suggested that if he thought that it would be of any use he could always make a written appeal/-3- 3° appeal for help to rbn Saud, The Shaikh of Kuwait told me that he understood that Shaikh Chassis would not press his request es for permission to enter Saudi territory tut would return to Basra and added that he had given M m a gift of 1,000 to help him in his extreme poverty. 3. On the 12th of March Shaikh Chassib again called on me and said that he was returning to Basra as soon as he could arrange a car and that provided I had no objection he was pro posing to send his wife and children here for a holiday, I replied that provided His Highness the Shaikh agreed I could not possibly object. He then went on to describe how the leaders of Khuzistan had appealed to him, how they had offered their services to the British and their only request had been that they should not be delivered over to the Iranian Govern ment again, and how no one had given any reply to him or his father^ people. He then talked to me for a time about his financial position and I was surprised at the smallness of their income and strongly advised him to sell the three houses they have here to the Shaikh of Kuwait, who is I believe willing to buy them. He said that the Shaikh was only likely to pay Es. 15,000 for the two near the Agency which was little more than a tenth of what they cost to build. I pointed out that it would cost at least Rs. 20,000 to repair them properly and he could not do better than sell them while there was a purchaser. He said he auite agreed and would do his best to persuade the other heirs to agree to dispose of the property in the meantime he offered them to the British Government rent free should they at any time wish to use them for war purposes./ No,0/205 Political Agency, Kuwait. 15th March, 1942, /uy pC&lt;CcJ- y * Please refer to my etter ,r o .0 /2(V dated the 14th 'arch, 1942. .

In spite of this it is clear from paragraph 2 o the enclos ure to your letter that Shaitch Chesaib is still intriguing and that he actuelly proposed to make a persons,! ap -eal to Ibn Saud to assist him to obtain his father 's position as ruler of Khuzistan. In the circuias^ences nuoh as 1 sympathise with him I find it iapossible to ask His Majesty 's inister at Tehran to intervene with the Persian Governm nt on his behalf. Indeed it seems probable that if rVaikh Chassib were persaittod to return to -hu ^is^^n awd res uflP possession of his father's property he would seize the opporl mity to do pverything In his power to oust the Persian authorities. As, however, Shaikh Chaasib has appealed to the Government of India I am forwarding a copy of your note to that Govern ment in case they may take a different view of the matter. / 4 Itejor T.Hickinbotham, OBEs, Political Agent, Kuwait. - * ! s-2- 4# Should Shailch Chassib visit you again before you receive any further instructions you should^ if yog see no olx^ACliDn-, call his attention to the breech of the assurance he gave to His ifejesty^ Consul, Basra, ani tell him that it is impossible to do anything for htm so long as he continues to intrigue in r &lt;huzi3tam hponfldeDtlal .

These were believed to be agents of 'Lhaikh ajid Khalifeh H and M iukalkh : ;OhaBied Arabi ' of Aiaara. 1 am afraid we heve no further details of the two agents, but there seems little doubt that the names of the Shaikhs as ^iven above are the aame as those more correctly given in your letter. I am unable to confirm, however, that the men were definitely the agents of the Shaikhs concerned but the information came from a usually reliable source. 3# / I should like also to qualify para 2 of Captain Jredge^ letter to tiie extent that though there may be no anti-iiritish feeling on the part of the Arabs here there is little doubt that many of them are very disapnointed at our evident policy to support the Persian 'jovcrrnment and officials Just when they thought they had done with Persians for g'ood, and this feeling may jrow stronger - at leesTt, this is the impression I have formed in the short time I have been here. I am informed that iihaikh Jhasib, eldest son of the old Uaaikh of ^ohami^ei'-ah, Khazal, has been down at Fao very recently (about 2/4/42) and has b.en getting his a^ants to viait the Arabs of Gusba and ^haiidgan on the Persian side in order to try to stir up trouble between them and the Persian officials. He is giving out that he nas some 2000 rifles and amiiunition at Kuwait with which he can supply them If required. In his case aa you are aware he is anxious to establish himself as the ruler of tnls district and is trying to get all the Arabs to recognise wim. he lives in asra and he was v amed only last year to desist from such activit ies. - JLam reporting^ the sa-tw^ tc Mlnleter at Tehran and sending a copy or This letter, as requested, to H.M 1 s Consul General st Basra and also to the hon'ble the . olitical j esident in the Persian uuif. fay L H .M 1 i'' Consul | KJ horraiiShaiir.COPY.

Yours ever, VICii C (KSUIATE His Majesty's Consulate-General, Basra.+3 ul Coaf Identlal, i «0.14-T Britisk Consulete, Kkorraisshalir, 14ttt April lb42« ^7/ vAYvj, s Sir, X ^ Vifitii reference to my tele^ra* flo»40 dated the 13tii April 1942, I kave the honour to say tket for some weeks past talk among the Arab community of this district kas centred otuch upon tlneir dissatisfaction with the Persian officials and their disappointment that the iiritisk occu-^ -pation kad not lead to an end of this 'tyranny'* and an establishiaent of Arab rule under British protection. Tke main cause for discontent apart from the general lack of love of Arab for Persian is the endless petty annoy- -ances and harassments Arabs say they receive at the hands of the Amnieh, These annoyances are for the main part such as might normally be inflicted upon the public by an ill-disciplined police force anywhere, but they certainly do not appear to worry the Persian public to the same ex- -tent. Tkey are^ magnification of every petty occur- -ance, extortion of money, tea, xaeals, entry of houses, rough treatment, false complaints et cetera, Tke present Chief of Amnieh seeras personally responsible for much of this dissatisfaction and it is no secret that even the Governor of Kkorramskahr finds kia MOct trying. He is endeavouring to sec are kis removal arid hopes shortly to succeed. The Governor himself seems to be very muck more popular and kis genuine efforts to get at the trutk of the matters brought to his notice and administer his dis trict quietly and happily isthink^ appreciated on all sides. About ten days ago the Governor of Khorranskahr com- -plained to me that Shaikh Ghassib, son of the late Shaikk Kkazal, kad ^one from Basra to ^'ao on about 1st April 1942 and met certain agents of his from the Persian side and instructed them to give as much trouble as possible to the Persian officials, especially in ^asbat an llassar (Gusbeh) and Shadgan. This I reported to His Majesty's Jinister, the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and infonased His Majesty's Consul-General in Basra and suggested that kkaikh Chassib mi^ht be given another warning to desist from these activities and tiiat he might be kept under obser- -vation. Since then rumours of some fora of concerted action by all Arabs in iMauzistan and those in the vicinity along tke Iraq border kave been steadily gaining ground in the bazaars of Abadan and Khorran.shahr. I'ke main theme being that upon a chosen day Shaikh Chassib would come and all Arabs would run in from their villages concentrating upon the nearest centre Ahwaz, Khorramshahr or Abadan in order to loot and revenge themselves upon the Persian officials. It was said that the British authorities would not inters -vene but would even support them. It is well nigk im- -possible to trace the source of these rimiours, but it seems Sir Reader W.Bullard, K.C.M.G.,C.I .E., that/ Hie Majesty's Ministerj Tehran.tkat Much may kavc enaueted froa various antit^ritisk elements In tiie nel^kbourkood who aay be anxious to stir up unrest of any sort, and a *a«b«r of Arab loafers and ne 1 er-do-wells who *igkt welco «e any chance of looting. Certain it is that apprehension of soae sort on tke lines indicated was generally held by the Persian officials, bazaar shopkeepers - mainly the Jews - Miropeans 1 servants and tne like* liut there was notiiinj tangible to go on. Un the nomirig of 12tk i was telephoned by Mr-Faun- -tiiorpe, becarity officer of the Anflo-lranian Oil Company and told tiiat a usually reliable source had info me d kim that within tiie next few nights an attack upon Abadan and KhorraiashaiiLr was to be made by Arabs frow the Iraq side of the bkatt&gt;-al-^rab which would be supported by all local Arabs within the vicinity. wir.Faunthorpe sent a wan over to see what he could discover. Directly after Mr.Bell, Station Superintendent, Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, iUaorram- -shahr, also informed me tnat he had similar news and that it was definitely k^own to nir* Wat ^kaikk Ciiassib f £ sister, iihairiyek^ad arrived from Tekran and was buying considorable quantities of flour, rict and i^iee and arranging some kind of reception in a house at Kut-e-Shaikh on the opposite side of tke river to ivhorramskakr. Jbater information from both these sources confirmed that that nigkt or the next was the one chosen* I had myself interrogated certain Arabs known to me ani received nothing but reassuring statements thougk none would deny that eertain plens did exist, but all declared that no sort of action would ever take place until or unless the British authorities gave it their blessing. Tiiey were of course told tiaat no such action would in any circumstances be tolerated and taat if anyUiing of the sort was attempted they would find that they would not only have to contend with the Persians but also the British. ike information received was ]guucm^x.Gcx passed on to the British .Naval and Military authorities in Khorramshahr and Abadan, and also the Governor of Kiiorramshakr. Tke latter with the Chief of Police and A^niek appeared to have received similar news already and had disposed tke Police and Amniek in readiness* The Governor, incidentally, kad also re- -ported a few days before that he did not consider the Aanieh and Police forces in Kiiorraiashahr and Abadan strong enough. There are no Persian military forces here. The Police BtrengW is approximately sixty in 4horraBishahr and one hundred in Abadan and that of the Amnieh one hundred and thirty eight for kttorramfehahr and ^uadan* Tke Officer Comraanding Kumaon Rifles in charge of Military Defence in Abadan and KhorrE»shahr immediately issued a scheme to meet trie occasion a copy of whlek is appen- -ded, and arrangements were made by me in consultation with the Officer Commanding and Officer Commanding ^aval base at Khorramshahr for the stronger protection of a petrol dump and the evacuation to the Aiaval Base K Naval launches of all British subjects in Khorramshakr (about 60 men, women and children) in case of absolute necessity. Tke Vice-Consul and 1 arranged to collect these persons in oar houses when and if any circumstances, which we judfed demanded it, should arise/4. Caiasslb and that ht kas beerj told that w« shall aiost assuredly assist the Fersians in case of trouble, CI append a copy of a letter now received^. I kad a lon^' iuterview witk tiit Cioveriior during the afternoon of the 13th and he is convinced that Skaikh Ghassib or his agents have been spreadinf news amonf the Arabs here of the possibility of his coiain^ to Khorra^shahr to take his place at the head of the Arabs. he does not necessarily connect the occurances of the 12th with this but he believes a certain local vrab Shaikh Haji Ali Fassali had actually collected a party of twelve araed ^rabs fro* Iraq that night and that they were to »eet in the house of the Shaikh 's sister at Khorraushahr. I have had a variety of explanations for the com- -mencement of the incident itself. The firt»t is that given at tat outset, a second ie that the party of twelve Arabs described by the Governor were seen and fired upon by persons who thought they were ordinary robbers, and a third that two police who had taken liquor saw a do^ and Mistaking it for a suspicious character fired two shots at it. This started the hue and cry and the police themselves bolted taxi taking refuse in ay motor driver s house. My motor driver vouched for the presence of trie two police at his house, in ay own mind 1 favour the third theory, and 1 have strongly advised the Governor to exercise the utmost care in sifting any other story, since ^ suspect a tendency on the part of the Persian authorities to take advantage of this occurrance and use it as an excuse for rounding up and deporting certain Arabs they dislike. The ni^ht of the 13th passed off quietly thougii one unexplained shot was heard at 2 a.m. Today, 14th, the Goven^r informed me tnat two agents and leading Arabs of ohadgan^Abdul riassan Mojjadem and JNasir bin Fazal had g'one to Basra and he believed them to be in Shalkk Ghassib*6 house. This infonrjation 1 kave passed to Colonel S argon, C.I.C.I., Basra# Evidence of the general attitude of the British authorities seeras to have had a considerably heartening effect upon the -Persian population, whilst the Arabs seea to be con- -tent to accept the situation. At no time however will they deny there is anything in the air: they merely re- -iterate that they are solely for the British and will do nothing without their orders. This I believe to be the case, but there raust always be a risk of snail parties of irres- -ponsible or irrepressible elemtats who may take advantage of any opportunity for loot, whilst a realisation that not iing is to be hoped for from the oritish, except announcements that grievances will be examined and justice done by the new Persian Government-announceuents received by tue Arabs wita considerable scepticism - and continued petty harassing by the Amnieh may lead to soaetiiing on a much larger scale.

His latest information he had obtained by telephone enquiry himself from the Customs post, where he said the only occupantj a customs farraj&amp;s» declared he had just seen the ^rabs and was about to run away himself. 1 accordingly passed on this report and request to the officer Comnanding Military and ^aval officer in charge i«aval .aase, stating that i- would try to verify the information and discover exactly where the Arab force was, 1 ^ave it as my opinion that though i- could not vouch for numbers it certainly seemed that something really ^as happen ing, and it might be well to taxe precautions whilst it was yet daylight, it seemed possible that Arabs might be collecting in the vicinity with the intention of carrying out a raid after dark. Xhe Officer Commanding decided to send across one Company of ^umaon Hifles from Abadan to supplement the platoon of Hyderabad otate forces which it had already been arranged, in conjunction with the i*avy, should come to ^horramshahr from sunset to sunrise since the incident of the 12th. A decond company of Kumaonis and another platoon of Hyderabads followed later. The first company arrived just as darkness set in and took up positions covering the European residential quarter and the town, shortly after the Chief of ^innieh returned, having posted him men in the -ustoms -ost, with the report that he could find no trace of ^ny party of Arabs. It was thought possible they might have moved northbf the Customs post and lain up somewhere, i-he night, however, passed ofi without incident, except for four isolated shots at various intervals from the Iraq side of the ^hatt-al -Arab, and ^hich have not yet been explained as far as 1 am aware. in the morning, a reconnaisance by air and a motor patrol of a detachment of some 40 Gurkhas from Basra was undertaken, it was decided not to patrol from this are3, to avoid possibility of confusion, until the evening when die Mimaonis carried out a motor patrol in front oi -^horramshahr to the frontier. x^o traces of Arab gatherings or unusual numbers were discovered. i&lt;or any persons carrying ar as. During the morning of the ICth i^-ajor ue^cock, Area liaison Officer,^huaistan, and myself carried out exhaustive enquiries into the origin of the reports, i had arranged the night before with the Governor that the -nj ci oi Amnieh, with four of his men, the shaikh and the taxi-driversj who had brought news and whom the Governor had said were in police custody pending investigations, should meet us ana go in cars to the place where the ^rabs had been sighted. intantion was to inspect the ground and if no tracks ^ found to demand their explanation tor their lalse reports. Accordingly at 6-30 a .m. kajor Jeacock and ^i waited at the rendezvous but no party materialised. At 6-4^ a.ou i sent round to the ^mnieh ^nd was ooii that the Chief had gone out on inspection. Thereupon i telephoned the Governor and he assured me that four n^jiieh with the Shaikh were on their way and would be there within ten minutes. lifter- 3 - \y about tnat period the Chief of ^mnieh appeared in a car, and we a&amp;ked him where the party was* He seemed quite ignorant ana asked what we proposed to do. wn learning our intentions he declared that he himself had already inspected the place and was convinced we should discover nothing. However we insisted that we shouid atileast go out with him and the shaikh *nd so went to the Police station to collect the latter, ^nere we were told that the -^haikn nad never been to ^horramshahr out only a policeman who had brought his letter. •»e asked x'or tne policeman ana one was produced who said he could take us to him, i^nd we set forth, ^t the old tireless station just outside ^horramshahr a policeman appeared wno was identified as the man we wanted «nd he conducted us to a village nameo oara about 2 or 3 miles on. Here we met the shaikh wno said he had sent the message to the Governor. I asked if he was the Shaikh of ^riyaz and was then told that that was a mistake aad it was this shaikh and not the shaikh of Ariyaz who had written the message. *«e questioned him as to how he came by this information and a ere told that the Customs farrash had in his turn learnt it from a taxi-driver named Hadir. ''e asked what had become of ^adir and were told that he was in custody in i^horramshahr. This surprised me as it was this same man wno was said to have reported to Mr. i^ell of the anglo-Iranian Oil Company, xhe latter had already told me that ^adir had absconded to Basra. However we returned to ^.horramshahr and went to the Chief of Police, ^nere we asked if the taxi-driver was in custody ^na were assued he was, together wltn two others who had brought news from Ahwaz. «• said we shouin like to see these men if they had no objection and were told uhat they would be brought at once. In the interval we went over the events of the night before and concluded that xiut ^11 the information received wati oased upon two reports only, une taxi driver from Ahwaz and tne taxi driver from Basra, am tnat all apparently confirmatory reports from other sources originated in fact from these. As we were talking a Calonel in the ^ray entered in a somewhat breathless otate vhe had presumably been sent for somewhat hurriedly) and was introduced all round, ^e were told he was in charge of the frontier and that from now on the ^mnieh were to work under him. we replied tnat we could not understand this as we thought the army and amnieh were under totally different Ministries. The statement was then qualified by saying that this officer would merely be referred to. M, this stage the Chief of Police who had been very flustered all through evidently decided to try to head us off, and to change the subject, invited us to take tea. 1 declined saying that i had much to attend to and had only one more question to ask. I therefore repeated my request to see the taxi-drivers. «*e were then blandly told that when they said they had the taxi- drivers they did not mean actually at the station, out that they were in ^horramshahr '^nd could be found when necessary. At this point 1 decided to leave and, bidding farewell somewhat abruptly, Major Jeacock and 1 took our departure, leaving my ^unshi to inform them of our feelings at this absurd and disgraceful pantomime of inefficiency abd deceit and to say that I proposed to ask the Governor for an explanation. j-ater that morning 1 succeeded in getting hold o the/51 the taxi-driver frota Ahwaz. He aeeured me that he had seen 500 armed Arabs at 'Arab Hamed about 20 • 30 miles from Ahwas# After questioning him further X was convinced that if he had seen anything all that he oould have seen was some harmless nomads J[^ ^ near Ahwas 9 of whom 1 have since received information, oonsisti^ ^oU^of a few families and cattle. 1 have been told that the driver [ rJU 1 i ad . ir ,i lafl b ® en f ounA in Basra and is being brought to Khorramshahr. Y ^ W n 1 • h * 11 •xp«ct him when 1 see him. My only deaire to ses theee rV; • ^ drivers was in the hope of being able to confront them with their 1 1 u, y) falae reports and frighten them into revealing who had inspired 1 15 them into making them* I had had a growing suspicion since the ^ HL 12th that poesibly Axle sympathisers might bs endeavouring te get such rumours carried around for obvious purposes# This may be 1 the onae but, for myself, I now feel convinced that the root of the matter is sheer nervoueneas. There really is a general feeling of uneasiness regarding Arab activities and any sign of anything approaching a collection of Arabs, whether harmlees nomads, woman and children or cattle, is likely to becoms magnified Into the sort of reports we have been receiving, and the taxi-drivers perhaps really did see something, harmless though it was in reality. Only today the Governor reported that a body of 500 Arabs had been seen near Marid and that he had sent some amnieh and police to investigate. As the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's Chief ^ilot happened to be returning by air from Ahwas, he was asked to reconnoitre the place, which wxoept for a valve houee and small village is incapable of eonceallng any body of men from a low flying aircraft. The Vilot reported that except for a few sheep there was no sign of anytning at all. This may of course have been A elaborate attempt at fase^saving, but Z have no doubt that we shall oontinue to get such reports from time to time until conditions settle down generally. From all our investigations, therefore, it eee»$*ulte clear that there is no gathering of Arabs in the neighbourhood of the kind reported, anywhere around Khnrremshahr or Abadan. Z am equally convinced from the extensive enquiries which Z have conducted through Arab leaders, sending out trusted servants etcetera, that nothing whatever ie oonteirmlated. What Z believe has happened is that for some months past Sheikh Chassib from Basra has been endevouring to assert his position as Isaisr of Arabs in this district through various of his agente, with a view to hie being able to assure the Britieh authorities that he has their support, and by repreeenting all etories of oppression by the Persians - in particular the Amnieh • he hopes to persuade us to instal him as Shaikh of Hohammsrsh. Such stories will of course be grossly exaggerated. For example not even the Said 1 saw in Ousbsh asserted that his relatione had been ill-treated to the extent of having their eyes put out or certain parte of their anatomy twieted as deeoribed in Combined Intelligence Centre Iraq, Basra's report attached te my despatch of 14th April. Theee efforte of Shaikh Chassib 9 s may have been mis - represented or have become dietorted In the telling until it- has come to be believed that he has the intention shortly to gather togetherk fprce and leet Khusietan and take revenge upon the Pereian authorities. Vvery Arab Z have met says tW. 5 - the same thing • nothing has been organised and they are Absolutely at the oomniand of the British aul many are not eyen interested in Shaikh Chase lb* All th^r ask is relief from/the oppressions of the Amnielu They have all been told of the latest resolution of the Hew Persian Oorernment te tgotify renuine grierances. that they can begt help the British PjtilMiflif by remaining quiet and that erery effort is being made by the Governor to correct the Aatinieh and that we are taking all steps we c Ato see that it is done* They beg, however 9 that the Aainieh might be totally removed fcnd that they should be permitted to furnish cash or any other guarantees for law and order in their areas* They have been told that this is ^ot practical and that the British must support the Hew Government, but that svsry effort will be mads to see that Justice is done* Zn the meantime, aggravating though these false alarms lire been, certain good has come 6f it all* The looal Persian authorities and people are definitely relieved «^ r this sign of vigorous action which the British are evidently prepared to take to assist the administration to maintain order and protect lives and property* It must have had a sobering effect upon the minds of Arabs who may have been eonteralating any violent action, and for ourselves we have been a^le to see how our plans to meet such contingencies may work in practice, and much useful knowledge of the ground and conditions has been gained, especially by myself* furthermore I think that the exposure of the manner in which rumours accumulate and stories become magnified will put an end to much if not all the wild talk which has circulated dUring the past months* Lastly though it mar appear from this, long account, that the Z am afraid, over Governor is largely to blame for all that happened, in hie defence it should be ^aid that he gets no support from either Police and Amnieh and often much hindrance and opposition* Z have impressed upon him that the Amnieh and Police are solely to blame for all the unreliabl reports, feeling of insecurity and bitterness between Arab andlPersl anknd that though we can in the last resort support him, he must stand upon his own feet* He realises^this and is doing his utmost to obtain mors efficient and actuate personnel in both departments* Z have told him therefore that he will be well advised in future te concentrate everything upon Improving both Amnieh and Police and to ensure that the Arabs are left alone* This laet because it has been reported to me that already the Police have been calling up certain Arab leaders, including Shaikh ChassiVs sister, who came to my house on the night of the 14th for retugt, and endeavouring to pin upon them reeponeibility for all the events of the past few days* He has agreed with me in this also and is i think now as convinced as Z am that none of these people has bad anything to do with it and that the real explanations are those which Z have presented in these despatches* Z have the honour to be.

The request has obviously been addressed to the Political Resident because of the promises made by his predecessor in office in 1914 to Shaikh Sir khazal khan; it was, in fact, accompanied by a photographic copy of the letter conveying these promises, written shortly after the outbreak of war with Turkey.

Excellency,^ I have the honour to report that the family of Sheikh Khazal has been and still are loyal to British Grovemment, There is 59 one «ho can deny this loyalty of this family. Modern history in dicates a word in Ihis regard for the excellent services done during the last larld war by the late father of this family, which cannot be enumerated. He died with full enthusiasm and love to his ally Great Britain, his offsprings as well have the same loyalty ana love in their hearts. J J It appears that circumtances hawe not been in favour of this family in order to enable them to manifest theit loyalty, but on the other hand they can see no reason why they should be encountere with such stiffness and lack of facilities by the British Government officials. Furthermore, they have a pact which includes the following: The British Government undertakes ana guarantees our internal indepe- ndtnce in Arabistan and at the same time undertakes not to toueh our properties amd lands, that are in Iran with any misueage or/ -that not a single word of this pact % . best heritage that we ime had ^ — loyal father) has been complied with either in his favour or in favour of his heirs, but on the contrary we sae soooe persons whose properties have neen confiscated and were driven out of their positions during the Sx-Pahlawi # 8 reim have been returned wnereas this onfortunate family alone Eas been deprived of this privilege because of her silence^ ^e, therefore, put our full confidence in the British Government, asking Your Excellency to take into consideration the bad finqpial position of this family # It is a known fact that every mesber Df this family can 0 return to his position among his tribes, with the certainty that the latter are everready to obey orders to fight with their sole enemy the Government of Ira^Ahe above mentioned facts we believe will justify the end of our silence, in demanding the return of pur properties m Iraua. Your Excellency may rest assured that the faaily of Skeikh Khazal does not vcmt the interwention of any individual, but the British Goternemnt Offic]to boIts her complicated matters, beliere that ' should Your Excellency choose to give this letter the same considerition as our previous one the caclusion to be dram is that Your Excellency have not complife with the conditions of tee pact ehich is in our possession ancf we then see that either • we nave to come to a conclusidn with the Iranians who confi scated our property or, something will bed one to alter the present situation. ■ I • ' ^ r 1 ^ r* U | : .L. 11 ^ f * 1 iilO-' I have the honour to remain Tour Excellency^ most obedient servant, (sd) S.Ghasib.

He then proceeded to occupy GUSBEH (on Abadan 1Island) but on the approach of Persian troops which the G.O.C. Persian Army Division of Khuzistan had despatched against him with commendable promptitude, Shaikh Abdullah fled into Iraq. Some comment has been heard to the efiect that in the British 'zone', unlike the Russian, Persian troops are allowed to move freely and are even encouraged by the British military authorities to deal with disorder promptly and in their own way.uiw Extract from Ahwaz Diary No. 20 for the month of November 1946, T'lir-r Meanwl } ile Sheikh Abdullah has continued to indulge in his dreams of attacking the Persians and making for himself an independent Khuzistan, guaranteed of course rl US ;v, a power of attorney from his half-brother Ghassib, but omits to call attention to the fact that it is dated July 1944.

Thanks to prompt action by General Officer Commanding (and to the fact that where the Allied troops are British the Persian authorities are not hampered in defence of their national interests) Abdullah and the perhaps 300 or iOO Arabs who followed him from Iraq were easily dislodged and on December 12th His Majesty's Consul at Hohammerah reported situation was virtually back to normal c 2 # Incident gave rise to wildest ravings in Tehran where it was reported 'on good authority' that there had been an Arab rebellion in Khuzistan on a large scale and that Arabs had captured Ahwaz, Deduction was made by some that British had brought about rebellion as a warning that they could play Russian game if they wished and when affair was already over journal de Tehran had an article in which the incident was represented as pretty much of equal weight as the troubles in the North, '.Fortunately it was able to give British journalists correct information and to explain the background. For years the heirs of Sheik Khazal have been trying to recover/-2- recover what may be oalled the private as opposed to the public property of their late father. Tith the unofficial help of His Majesty's Embassy the eldest son Chasib has been negotiating a settlement in Tehran. Abdullah has always been difficult to bring into line with other heirs and his intractability has now broken out in armed rebellion,, 3.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose a translation of a letter received from Shaikh Abdullah Khaz'al requesting instructions as to his future actions. 2. He has verbally stated (a) That he will carry on no political activity while in Kuwait. (b) That if granted an amnesty and permission to live on his property in Iran he will assist the Persian GrOvernment in every way provided it does not come under Oommunist control. He points out that, when tribes such as the ^ashgai who were persistently anti-British during the war have succeeded in regaining their 'rights', it is an anomoly that the family of ShaiKh Khaz T al who have always been our friends should not have regained theirs. (c) That he has now no property left in T Iraq and that he is prepared to die fighting for his rights rather than to continue his present existence. He appears to oe under the impression that with 500 rifles and the support of the divines of Nejef he could establish the independence of Khuziztan^and maintain it against the Persian Government and army, provided there was no hostile interference from British forces. (d) That if his return to Khuziztan is forbidden by us and he is required to reside elsewhere than in Kuwait or in Saudi Arabia he must either have a stipend from the income of his family estates or be reduced to beggary. 3. The back^ound to his excapade appears to have been as follows; He visited Nejef and consulted the Shia' religious leaders, in particular Shaikh Abdul Karim Zanjani, and found them concerned over the future of their faith in Iran in view of^Communist influences and the new Kisrowi religion. I^surmise that they refused to proclaim .1ehad but suggested to him that, if he could take ijd residence in Khuziztan and form a focus for local .eel- in^ they were prepared to accord him their backing at the appro priate time. This accords with an approach previously made to this Agency by a Shia* divine here on the lines ^that *he Arabo of Khuziztan would welcome independence of Persia am affiliation with India under British protection.

COi^FiuEitjliAL RiSufe (M I ICOPY TRANSLATION • ■ ST,- I&lt;0 Subject:- Shaikh Abciullsh's attack upon Failieh. H.B.M. Ambassador, Through Governmen't's Representative, Kuwait, I have the honour to draw Your Excellency's a otention to the unpleasant incident caused by Officers of the Persian Army. Please be assured that members of the Khazal family and particularly myself consider themselves attached (protected) to (by) the British Government, We never have &amp;nd never will take any action contrary to the interests of H.B.M. Government. We have shown ourselves to be devoted friends to the Government during our continuous good relations. The best proof is the forebearance we have shown in face of the oppressions and the lalse promises made by the Persian Government. All our fellow-men have received justice but this family, who are entitled to receive Justice more than anybody else, still do not know what to do and are in a most unfortunate position. Your Excellency must know that if it were not due to the British Government's political expediency I would not bear so much oppression but would shed my blood to the last drop in order that the usurped rights of this family might be secured and that Arabia might be purged of the wickedness and oppression of these covetous, despotic officials of the Persian Government and of the dangerous propagation (against religion and nationality), I wish the British authorities concerned would notify their non-interference in such cases in order that I might physically prove my sayings. In order to prove my sincerity and loyalty to the British Government I think it is simply sufficient to point out that when I returned to my country I prevented the Officers of the Persian Army (whom I eventually forced to withdraw) from causing a riot (which would have been against the interests of the British Government) otherwise the opportunity for revenge was at hand when the tribes had sworn to make a general stand and draw attention of the Arab world to the oppressed state of the Arabs living in Khuzistan and thus save the Arabs of that province and the family of Khazal from the tempestuous sea of oppression. In any case, owing to the above facts I let the opportunity slip by and returned to Iraq. In Basra I unfortunately noticed that the Iraq flattering officials were persecuting me, I therefore went to Kuwait where I now live. On my arrival I reported the details of the case to the representative of the British Government in Kuwait and am now expecting to receive your fatherly instructions in this connection.

Through H.M's Political Agent, Kuwait. '7 After offering great re&amp;pects, In continuation of uany communications with the authorities of your Great Government, and having not received any satisfactory reply or any fruitful result, I was obliged to submit this letter to Your Excellency, ex plaining clearly and briefly what I have to say. ^our Excellency. I arid my family have been suffe ring f01 a/any years, various injustices and oppressions, the humiliating and .vron^iui. effects of which we have borne patiently; and we hqve been driven away and pursued; and we have lost many chances of recovering what was forcibly ta-ien away from us. In addition to all this, we were prepared to shake hands with the Iranian authorities and co-operate with them, according to the wishes of your (ireat Government to whom, we are bound with promises and covenants, while all our equals, either loyal or disloyal to you, ' have seized that opportunity without giving a damn for any one and regained by sword what was forcibly taken from, them and they have become semi-independent in their territories where their influance runs, having se^f government, in spite of the existance of the government authority in those territories. But we, who consider ourselves more deser ving from all points of view, whether elemental or other wise, are still living in hopes and imaginations; testing the bitterness of material and mental humilation. As we are not in a position to remind or to censure, but we are in a position of declaring the facts, thus I am bothering you with this letter saying:- Things have reached a cli ax and the noose is being /tightened round me and my patience is failing especially now that our country and religion are M on the brink of a precipice, and I do not know when it will collpse' ; this is due to the activity of destructive propaganda, which has begun to leak into my country and my birth ^lace, Arabistan, from the interior of Iran and even from Iraq, and which is supported by the government officials and the public; I mean those who are connected with the propaganda and are loyal to it. I, therefore request now, i.e. before the opportunity is missed and before such propaganda spreads in my country on a larger scale and more actively, not to prevent me from returning to my aforementioned native country, so that I may live among my relations, with whom I am bound by ' alliance and oath ' and be able to work with them and co-operate with the government offioi»le( the faithful ones of course); I mean those who have the same spirit as me and my followers, i.e. to saorificft evervthing for our country and our religion by opposing every destructive torrent and resisting any tyrant or traitor. Indeed I have decided to oppose any person who comes between us and our sacrifice. I have also decided that when I return to my country, to stir up the great leaders of our religion, as I believe it is our religious duty to call them to action, and with whom I am personally bound. I shall consider whoever may act against this order, whether he is a government official or otherwise, to be the agent for that propaganda, and they are of the type of the 5th column, whose purpose of acting against me or preventing me from returning to my native country is ' to poison the relations ' between the simple tribes of Arabistan, whom circumstances have for many years opposed, ( as it is well known tc you ) and mo have become&lt;; - 3 - disunited and incapable and having no leader who could icana^e their affairs, as have the neigiibourin^ tribes. But on the contrary, there are amongst them some elements of dissension and evil, whose sole purpose is to mislead and deceive, endeavouring to delude them for their per sonal benefits. I, therefore, am, sure if they remain as they are, and if I don't correct them, their nationality and their religious rights will be destroyed, and an irremediable calamity will occur, - 'it will then be no use crvin^ over spilt milk. ' I, when submitting this letter, have full confi dence that Your Great Government is very much interested in the protection of the safety of nations and religions. I. therefore request you not to fail me and ^ive me an early reply, which I hope will include a statement of no objection to my returning to my country. I wish to rdd that I will always be ready to receive your advice and bound to protect your interests. Usual Ending.No.485-3. ' „ .

During his visit Shaikh Abdulla spoke Persian at hie oun request, and it is clear that this really is his mother- tongue, and that he is more Persian than Arab. He was expensively dressed in semi-Arab attire, and did not • me ^- type wh0 wa8 lil£el y 40 receive much syzrqpathy m this someidaat austere towi. I could not «ive ] much time as I should have wished as ray stay in Kuwait was very brief. 2. He began by explaining his case at some length rery much on the lines expressed in his letter. He said that while we had helped our enemies we had done little for our friends. The Bakhtiar^i, #iose attitude towards us had been doubtful, were wealthy and in high positions, and the Qashqai, #10 had been definitely hostile, had settled their affairs and were in full possession of their properties. We had prevented Shaikh Khaza^s family from helping themselves and had done nothing for them ourselves, tfhat were the promises which had been made to Shaikh Khazal ? Why had we done nothing to honour them ? Why were they begging their bread ? Over 20 years had passed and we were no nearer a solution and their condition was getting worse every day. 3. I thought it better to be frank, and I told him that his letter appeared to show that he was mentally unbalanced. I said he was in no sort of position to combat propaganda or actively support religious reforj^, or rescue his country, and that we had cettainly never given him the slightest encouragement to undertake anything of this sort. The action he had taken could only affect his family very seriously and must have set back any hope of a settlement. He expressed the view that he had done nothing beyonil return to his native country. I asked him what would happen to any unwelcome exile who returned to Kuwait with a posse of gunmen and set himself up in .his former habitation. Would not Shaikh Ahmad immediately move against him ? If his intentions were peaceable why had he taken these tufangchis with him ? He told me that he had been in touch with the Persian Consul in Basra, but had been unable to extract any definite answer from him Aether he could or could not visit / his....2 i $7; his natiye country and tiiat he had repeatedly seen everyone in the Baghdad Embassy and that he had merely taken these men with him because he was uncertain what reception he might receiTe* I told him that if he were eyer to return to Persia again, he could be quite certain what reception he would receiye 9 as he would almost certainly be hanged* 4* He then asked me tfiat he should do* He had sold all his property in Iraq» and could not return there as they would imprison him 9 nor could he liye for eyer in Kuwait. He had no funds and was too proud to beg* He could not forget that he was the son of Sahikh Khazal. He asked me to tell him as a father tfaat he should do• I replied that it was easier to tell him what not to do and that was neyer to return to Persia as he would certainly be executed. As for what he should do now I would require time for thought. 5« Shaikh Khaza^s family is^ of course^ now no concern of this Residency 9 except in so far as our omission to honour our bond affects our good name afoong the Arab States in the Gulf* Only the other day Mr* Jameson of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company informed me that Major Holmes 9 trunp card in blocking a purely British oil concession in Kuwait had been the fate of Shaikh Khazal* Mr. Harold Hicholson when Charg^ d* Affaires at Tehran» drew attention nearly twenty years ago to the fact that nothing had been done to carry out our promise, and little progress appears to haye been made since then. My ii^pression is that sooner or later His Majesty's Goyernment will haye to subsidise Shaikh Abdullah bin Khazal, and probably other members of his family as well 9 but the first point to be settled appears to be the terms upon which he can be allowed to return to Iraq. 6* I am sending copies of this despatch to the Goyernmant of India and His Majesty's Ambassadors in Tehran and Baghdad and the Political Agent 9 Kuwait.

You will no doubt by now have seen despatch No. 485-3 of April 21st from Political Resident Persian Gulf to India Cffice. 1 am inclined to agree with view expressed in paragraph 5 that if we cannot persuade the Iraqis or Persians to support Abdullah and his brothers we must do so ourselves. (In that case we could at least decide where they are to live - Cyprus seems an obvious place). I doubt whether Iraq would keep Abdullah in forced residence for ever. I also doubt a i satisfactory outcome to negotiations for compensation between Chasib and Persian government.

Indeed, I have already pledged myself to this and my return to my hone land and birth place w^s for nothing but this, -and if I had any aimc other than to establish my rights, such as to cause trouble or bloodshed, 1 would have taken advantage of opportunities which I have had previously, but I disdained these.

I4y withdrawal was not at all due to cowardice and fear on my part but, on the contrary, due to my shrewdness an. soluly to avoid bloodshed and to safeguard your interests and His lOajesty's.

I have already made many statements and have submitted my complaints together with those of my countrymen, the Arabs of Arabistan, ( who authorised me to negotiate with all authorities, regarding their nationality, freedom &amp; rights, of which they have been deprived ) to the authorities of your Jreat jovernm^nt, requesting them to help us, because I believe we hav~ rl^ht to administer our own rxf^irs and obtain our freedom. I even mentioned this to H.E. your predecessor, when I had the honour of meeting him. The position is worsening and the situation has be come critical. Our self-respect is bein^ threatened both materially and spiritually due to the increase in power am of that tyrant party. 1/therefore obliged to'remind you of the loyalty and faithfulness of my late father, ( Sir Shaikh Khaza'al) and of the promises and friendship. I also appeal in view of my personal loyalty and sincerity vhich I proved or occasions under different! criditions I request you to do us justice and treat our case with /L kindness and do not deprive rae of /our valuable advice and of your kindness.

Abdullah Khazal came to see me at Kuwait recently. He stated that he preferred death to beggary and asked whether we would stop his returning to Persia. I told him I would let him have a reply later through the Political Agent. 3. I have now instructed Political Agent to ask the Shaikh to take all possible steps to prevent Abdullah leaving for Persia and if Political Agent is fully satisfied that we can successfully prevent Abdullah^ departure to inform him that in no circumstances can we countenance his return to Persia. 4. Unless we put Abdullah in prison at Kuwait to which the Shaikh would almost certainly not agree, I am doubtful if we can indefinitely prevent his departure for Persia. He is very excitable and is likely to become more desperate as time goes on. In view of the importance of his not being permitted to return to Persia I strongly recommend that he be deported to Aden or some other Crown Colony and given an allowance. - HAY - NCJ Copy sent to P.A, Kuwait under P.L.

The Governor of Khorramshahr was under the impression that he left Tehran without permission, but took no further action in the matter. The Abadan and Khorramshahr tribal chiefs at first decided not to call on him, as they did not wish to give the Tudeh an opportunity to misrepresent their activities. Certain Snaikhs and other ^rabs who are now in possession of Khazal 1 s properties are naturally afraid of being dis possessed but other elements believe that Shaikh Chassib is able to claim his rights whereever he is and that it would not be wise to resist .such claims.

J J' J I, I I* Iby the -haikh and now s fc aln confirmed, it is doubtful if Abdullah Khszaal will be permitted to indulge in any intrigues from Kuvait - There is the possibility, however, that his precarious financial position may make - him restive, ?nd so it may be as welJ to ask for ar earlj opinion on the possibility mentioned in paragraph 3 of S 65. d,f,a, S 73 - File ? A' V A- 30 3^- 5 7 3-4^ I uis cussed this matter wi til Major Stewart who said that he doubted that Abdullah Khazal could produce any serioas trouble if he returned to Persia, and that the only difficulty would be the mud that would be thrown at us for our protegees pranks. He added that the remainder of the family were not well disposed towards him a nd would give him no support. He observed that he thought the family in general were heading for a crash, as they lived expensively and spent consideraule sums which they can only raiae by loans. Once these loans cease they will be in a /cry bad ^ay. I think the matter might rest until I aave Deen to Kuwait and seen th^Oman myself. 3a. a 28.3.46. |\ ^/V/v &amp;. ^ IU z LOU ^ Ku^^j ^ ^ 4/ n)*h - Ik ^ I 33 *14*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000169_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/388</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000169</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/388</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 26/185 V (F 96) Shaikh of Mohammerah'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1946</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-06T09:49:30</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">per</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (233 folios)</extent><extent>The volume is arranged chronologically.</extent><extent>Foliation: There is an incomplete foliation sequence and a complete foliation sequence.
