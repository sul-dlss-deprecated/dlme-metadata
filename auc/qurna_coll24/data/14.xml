He tells of living for thirty years in a hilly area referred to as “the island,” including aspects like spending time in the ancient pharaonic tombs under the homes to stay cool in the summer. Coming from a family who worked as builders, he speaks of his own work as a builder (including a job in Iraq from in the late 1980s until the Gulf War) and as a security guard, and his retirement several years ago. Hassan discusses the attempts by antiquities authorities in the past to prevent residents from building new homes in Qurna, including fines and police reports levied against him. He recounts how a governmental decision led the residents of his area, including his own family, to leave their houses and move to another area called Al-Soyool in 1998. He maintains that the residents left their houses of their own free will because living conditions had been difficult, with problems with water, electricity, sewage, and small homes with distant bathrooms. Khabir notes problems with living conditions in Al-Soyool, including hot concrete houses and insufficient water and electricity.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
