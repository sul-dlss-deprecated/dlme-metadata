You will, I am sure, be interested to hear that on the evening of 10th Novemoer the Bahrain Masonic Club will give its anniversary Dinner and Dance; and its guests of honour are hoped to include H.E.The Admiral and his Staff, the P.A., the A.P. A. , and the senior officals of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. About two hundred guests are expected to assemble. Armistice Day, the 11th November, being a Friday, the Bapco staff will be on holiday; and if, without intruding, I may suggest it, I think it would be a very fine gesture if H.E. the Admiral should hold a short Parade Service at Jufayr to include the Silence at which all British and American suojects may be invited to attend. I think that such a service would have a most impressive effect locally.NP.595B. at Bahrain. 7th September, 1938.

The afternoon of 6th November will be more convenient than the fore-noon of 7th November, provided that the weather is suitable, as it will be the month of Ramadhan, during which the Shaikhs usually sleep till noon, on account of the fast. In this connection, I enclose a resume of the procedure adopted in 1936, when the Durbar was generally considered to have been very successful. I should be glad to know if you have any comments to make on it. Owing to Ramadhan, the Shaikhs will be unable to accept coffee, but will, I think, accept incense and rose-water. 2. The Shaikh of Qatar has been warned about His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief’s visit, and will be ready to come off when he arrives at Dohah in H.M.S.
