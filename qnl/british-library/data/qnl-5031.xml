Further information has reached me that Afghans are. endeavouring to induce Mohammedans of Ferghana Syrdaria and Russian Pamirs to join them and Bolsheviks in compact directed against the .British. It is,also reported that Afghans (corrupt group) to proclaim possession of part of Russian Pamirs already alluded to in my diary. I am sending agent there and will keep you informed. F.S. 1777 S. Kashgar report, 15th December. Ihaye received reports from Ferghana as follows.jrr-10th December,; Mission of 16 Afghans arrived at Marghilan end of November from Cabul to interview Mahomed Emin Beg regarding pan-Islamic Confederacy which it is proposed to form among Moslem peoples and States in Middle and Central Asia. Deputation brought two gold swords for presentation to Mahomed Emin Beg and Shermat, his cavalry commander. A deputation, has been sent by latter to Cabul this autumn with letter signed by about 100 influential men in Ferghana soliciting Afghan aid against Bolsheviks. Letter^ contains undertaking to f swear allegiance to anyone who would help them. Deputation was also sent to Constantinople with this view.. .Result of this deputation is being ascertained by me. All my agents report that Afghanistan wishes. active intervention in Russian Turkestan, : has hopes of expansion there and seems to be determined to eliminate British influence and to foster pan-Islamic movement. Mission from Cabul told Mahomed Emin Beg that Bokhara had been occupied by Afghan troops * -and that it was futile to expect help from British, as Afghans had defeated them, they had sued for peace and that British had been compelled to relinquish -control over Afghan foreign relations, whilst they had also been forced to with- draw from Askabad and Transcaspia and would soon be evicted from Persia.4 Russian 'furi^estan Mahometans are adversely impressecl at the Britisk (? withdrawal) from Transcaspia when Bolsheviks were weak and isolated in Turkestan, and now that Bolsheviks have gained in strength and power, Afghan advances and intrigues, as well as pan-Xslamic mdveinent, are appealing to the people. VIII.—Bolshevik relations with Bokhara, Khiva and Samarkand. '16288. M., 2nd December. After capture'of Krasnovodsk, Bolsheviks say they intend to concentrate large forces at Charjui. Agent surmises motive is to deal with Bokhara and f dpeh~up Termez line with a vie’W: to helping or coercing Afghanistan into action against India. 16328. M., 2nd and 3rd December.

New barracks being built and old onSs repaired. Samarcand Section. Garrison reduced to 400 men and 20 machine guns. Many reinforcements passing Kizil Arvat front, also trains with rails and railway material. Bolsheviks generally hated and Moslems constantly hold secret meetings discussing possibility of general rising. Bolsheviks are actively searching for arms but large quantities still in people’s hands. Unrest increasing owing to- scarcity of food. 1639,7. M., 4th Decepiber. Bokhara is to be. dealt with, not. necessarily in drastic fashion, as Bplsheviks are anxious not to alienate Mahometans. But Bokhara must (a) snrrender all white fugitives now sheltering there; (b) give ample supplies of food ; (c) surrender cash in exchange for Bolshevik’s paper, as Bolsheviks can Only carry on their plans in Afghanistan and Persia by means of cash, their paper being so depreciated. 16451.

They state attitude of, people of Bokhara is strongly anti-Bolshevik, but Amir outwardly assumes position qf neutrality.. They consider that Bolsheviks will turn on Bokhara after capture of Krasnovodsk,. mainly for purpose of obtaining money and supplies. 16846. M., 14th December. Russian officer who brought papers gives me following additional information :—Amir a,nd ministers and millions of Bokhara people detest Bolsheviks, but A.mir is in difficult position and endeavours to assuqie very non-committal attitude. There is no truth, as far as informant is aware, in story of Kabul-Bokhara marriage. 1 Afghans are hated by all. Afghan Consul, Abdul Shakur, plastered walls with anti-British propaganda, but these were torn down, by populace and spat upon. Bokharans are quite in dark regarding outside events, and have no idej of present position of civil war. • C.G.S. X. 521. M,—T., 4th December. Message from Karakhan to Eliaya as to suitably Bolshevik to be appointed as Resident in Bokhara. The man first nominated by the Tashkend.

They take Nicolai notes and gold an4;silver, coinage in exchange, and latterly have been taking much ; raw cotton. Bolsheviks .said to be short of rifles and ammunition (but recent captures from Koltchak should have eased this). 16948.

Meeting held of Bolshevik, Bokhara and Afghan represehtatives to consider currency questions. Bolsheviks asked Bokhara and Afghanistan to authorise acceptance of Bolshevik new paper money.' Bokhara said to assent on condition that Jizzak and Samarcand areals formerly seized by Russia should be restored to Bokhara. Afghans similarly demanded whole of Merv-Kushk area. No definite decision arrived at, but matter said to be referred to Moscow, Both Bokhara and Afghanistan have strong lever in recognition or otherwise of Bolshevik paper money.

XI.—Afghan Aggression into Russian Territory: Afghan political Relations with Bolsheviks in Turkestan. 16065. M., 26th November.. Fdllbwing additional information regarding the attitude of Afghans in Merv districts is given by my Turkman Intelligence Corre- . spondent:— After the somewhat heated discussion reported in my telegram M.D. 02549,1 dated 16th November, regarding the Bolshevik doctrine on complete ownership, Merv Afghans sent a deputation to Tashkend to interview‘Turkestan Commission on the subject. This was! ostensible object,'but they told leading Merv Turkmans confidentially that the main purpose of the deputation was to discover real • strength of Mahometans in Tashkend area and whether they could be relied on to join Afghans and Turcos (and, I presume,; probably Bokhara and Khiva) in active measures against the Bolsheviks. Messages from leading Turcos asking for “ some sign ’’ as to whether British approve of Afghan proceedings in Central Asia continue to reach me, an affirmative answer would probably have (? most important) effect, as the Turcos still place great store on our advice although many Turcos have nominally, (? joined) Bolshevics. In the meantime Afghans continue to assure Turcos that considerable reinforcements will be received soon. 16564. M., 7th and 8th December.' Unconfirmed report that Afghan reinforcements are now reaching Merv by train from Kushk. i See Issue fl., § XI., 15568. B 7276 16767* M., 12tli December. My chief Turcoman agent returned to-day from Sarakhs. He reports v 2f)th November thefe was important secret meeting between Afghan Sirdars'iil Merv and 10 leading Turcomans. Afghans informed Turcomana that some months ago Bolsheviks* in return for Afghan help against India, promised Afghans all Transcaspia conjointly with fCrasrfovbdsk up to Oxus. Notv, however, Bolsheviks Were making difficulties and excuses, and showing no intention to carry out their bargain. la cdnsCqtuettce Afghans advised Turcomans to refrain frbib giving assistance of any sort to Bolsheviks pending furthet disctission of fidlble Of future policy between Afghans and representatives of all sections of 'Turcomans. Afghans asked.that Summonses for such tneeting should be sent out at once to all other sections of Turcomans. Afghans said if once they obtained possession of Krasnovodsk/they had, guarantees of armed assistance of Turks, and together they could defy either Bolshevik or Volunteer attempts to recapture Transcaspia. Agent says Turcomans have no wish to come under either Turkish or Afghan ri\le as they have heard bad accounts of both. They want to be let alone and have no desire ,tq. assist either Bolsheviks or Volunteers. In the meantime they would view with pleasure trouble between Bolsheviks and Afghans. Many think that we are encouraging Afghans (? and even) Bolsheviks' (? themselves). ) Reports from various sources show that Bolsheviks are enormously jealous of Afghan influence and interference, though outward relations'remain correct. All recent arrivals from Askabad stipe Bolsheviks are apprehensive of some- Afghan treachery while they have nearly all available forces engaged towards- Krasnovodsk. 16862. M., 16th December. Afghans still interfering with Bolshevik orders and. instructing Turkoman villagers to withhold all help from Bolsheviks. Afghans state whole of area, Kushk to Merv, ceded to them. 000611. M.-^T;, 17th December. Karakhan informs-Eliava that a categorical promise has been given to the Afghan Envoy to readjust the Xushk and Panjdeh frontier, and that a Russo-Afghan Frontier Commission is to be formed and commence operations as soon as Moh&amp;mmed Wali If ban reaches Tashkend from Moscow. 17056. M., 18th December. Bolsheviks have announced that Panjdeh area is to be given to Afghanistan in commemoration ,of second anniversary of revolution and as evidence of Afghan-Bolshevik alliance. . It is said locally that Afghan Governor of Panjdeh will be Indian Emir now en route to Kabul. (Note .—Possibly Abdur Rah, who is believed to be of Baghdad Ghadr Party.) 17058. M., 19th December. In Merv-Kushk area considerable friction exists between Bolsheyiks and Afghans over question of supplies. Afghans announce that large reinforcements are being sent lo- Merv from Afghanistan. (C/.§ Y.; 17235. M., 23rd December. Merv. 15th December. Afghan, detachment now numbers 400 men. There is increasing friction between Afghans and local Bolsheviks,' largely on question of trade,- but also on account of general .Afghan interference and arrogance. Afghans give out that whole of Transcaspia will be ceded to them and that 25,000 Afghan troops will come in. | i Bolshevik Merv garrison is to be increased immediately to five battalions. Barracks are being hurriedly prepared and additional accommodation get ready. Bolsheviks. state that first army of 60,000 men is already beginning to* reach Tashkend; Afghans are buying horses from Turkomans and endeavouring to enlist large- number of Turkomans as irregular cavalry.

Presence of Persian Consul-General not reported. Same newspaper has fiery article entitled ‘ 4 Until next spring.” Says Soviet Bussia and her allies will spend the winter in active preparation for final conflict and that by next spring (May at latest) Imperialism will everywhere be dead. Another article denounces Bokhara as being almost British Imperialist. 16564. M., 8th December, From unanimity-with which Afghan officers in Russian Turkestan are engaged on anti-British campaign of abuse* it is considered that they must have received orders to this effecL 16672. M., 5th December. The Tashkend newspaper News states Afghan Consul- General Astern Khan has published the : following statement on Afghanistan relations: “The present armistice is only, temporary. The object of the Kabul “ Government in Concluding the armistice was merely to gain time, to gather in “the harvest, to reorganise army* and to fortify frontiers. The Afghan repre- “ sentative has strict injunctions to insist on the following terms and compromise “ for nothing less: England must set free India, Persia and Baluchistan; she “ must return to Afghanistan all territory seized in previous wars* Failing “ acceptance of these terms the Afghan representative will return to Kabul. “ Consul-General said that he did not suppose England would yield these wishes “ without endeavour, but even if she did yield, the Afghans would maintain a “ firm alliance with the Bolsheviks, in order to guard against the probability of “ subsequent treachery on the part of England.” W.N., Tashkend, 6th December. The Turkestan Department of the Russian Telegraph Agency has opened branches in Samarkand and Bokhara, where posters in Russian have been published ; in the courseof,the next few days Mussulman posters will also be issued. The Central Department of the Russian ^Telegraph Agency has opened a Mussulman branch for the . . . . . of the whole . . ... 16709. M., 11th December. Copy of Tashkent paper News recently reeei ved contains article on English designs in Middle East, and says profiting by abstention of Soviet Russia from all schemes for external aggression* England has seized Persia and now has designs on Turkistan. It is not with armed strength that English are making their approaches on Turkistan, but with remarkable diplomatic subtlety they are establishing for themselves such a position in Bokhara and Khiva that one fine day the whole of Turkistan will be in England’s power. We Bolsheviks must never forget the magnitude of England’s Eastern interests, of .how abhorrent to her will be the existence of,a Red'Turkistan. We must set to work at once to counteract the influence the English have obtained in our midst, and so far from allowing Turkistan. to fall into England’s orbit We must our-selves Use it 6s a base from which We shall compass the destruction of English power* not only in Persia but throughout all the Eftst. The slyly woven diplomacy of England in Turkistan must be checkmated, and that is ouf first task, as this achieved we must proceed to the destruction of our most powerful and subtle enemy, England. With the 1 downfall of the chief representative of imperialism and capitalism the triumph of Bolshevik ideals will soon be universal.

Oriental languages are taught^ and in this several Indians are engaged, whose names I am endeavouring to ascertain. Propaganda is also being prepared, and as agents become proficient they will be sent to India, China, ‘ and all countries with Moslem subjects. Those for India will mostly travel aia 'Afghanistan under Afghan auspices or by sea, under various disguises. Centres are-to be opened in India where propaganda will partly be prepared.

M.i 22nd December. Intelligence officer, Bajgiran, reports that Bolsheyik stafE officers have during the last few days visited Gaudan, just oyer frontier, in order to make arrangements for billeting and supply of up to 1,000 Bolshevik troops who are shortly to come there. In view of large reinforcements from centre now undoubtedly beginning to arrive ih Turkestan, this strengthening of all posts on Persian frontier is probable. It will mean, at least, increased difficulties in intelligence work, and increased smuggling from Persia, which latter seems connived at by Persian officials. 17236. M., 24th December.

Bolsheviks say that when these troops, who are all Russians, have arrived, they intend to take up stronger line both with local Mohammedans and with Afghans. Important officials and innumerable missions continue to arrive in Tashkent from Moscow. Bolsheviks say Turkestan will become most important, of all fronts as it is base from which to attack England.

They (Kurds) would shortly be joined by the Azerbaijan Republic, which would make an invasion of North-West Persia.

XVII—Appreciations of the General Situation. C.G.S. 79083 M.O., 16th December. Report by agent from General Lazareff at . Kizil, Arvat, arrived at Meshed via Askabad. Bolsheviks’ position in Trans- Caspia is precarious owing to acgte famine conditions, and there is grave discontent generally amongst professed Bolsheviks, the foreign communists are unsettled, and Turcomans; ready to rise. Bolsheviks realise this, and that everything depends on their early capture of Krasnovodsk, which would bring them oil, food, and prestige. Bolsheviks consider their position will be impossible if they cannot achieve this within next two months. 1 On the other hand, if they can effect early capture of Krasnovodsk they expect great results. They have had numerous visitors from Caucasus, and as , result they are convinced that with capture of Krasnovodsk the Caspian fleet would.immediately join them, there would be revolution, in Baku, and risings not only in Azerbaijan, but throughout Northern Caucasus, and a deadly blow would be struck at Denikin’s rear. Turkish envoys have also reached Bosheviks, and arrangements have been concerted for fall of Krasnovodsk to be signal for disturbances in Mesopotamia, North-Western Persia, and Kurdistan. ? I ? previously (two groups uhdecypherable) Bolshevik strength west of Askabad at about i4,00Q. There is great friction between the communists and the left social revolutionists, and agents consider' much might be made of this by suitable propaganda. Agent desires to point put advisability of Denikin instructing Lazareff to keep in direct touch with British Mission at Meshed, as latter not,only obtains important information, but can pass it on much more quickly than he can. 1 On the Caspian—near the month of Atrek River.d) 13 37360. General Malleson, 25th Decomber. From various sources I gather that Bolsheviks look to approaching capture of Krasnovodsk as heralding final’ collapse of .Denikin and inauguration of 1920 campaign against British everywhere in Asia. Meetings of Turkish, Bolshevik, Afghan and German agents in Turkestan have keen frequent of late. Expect Caspian Fleet immediately to - eeine over to them on capture of Krasnovodsk, and point out that with Krasnovodsk and Astrakhan in Bolshevik hands, Baku hostile, and' Petrovsk cut off, if not already captured, fleet will be left with no means of supply and refit unless it turns Bolshevik, With command of Caspian assured Bolsheviks say that they can : (l) (corrupt group) volunteer (corrupt group)s ; (2) inaugurate revolution throughout Caucasus ; ■ (3) invade Northern Persia^ (4) give signal for Turkish national movement on Mesopotamia; and, finally, with large numbers now entering Turkestan from centre encourage, or, if necessary, compel, renewal of hostilities between Afghanistan and India. This is to he accompanied by intense pan-Islamic agitation and fomentation of local grievances everywhere. Few weeks ago Bolsheviks were, by own admission, on point q! collapse for want of oil and fuel. Capture of Krasnovodsk, access to Baku, and entry into Don Basin will, they claim, place them in a position to carry out whole of above prograipine. They also state that huge captures from Kolchak give them ample supplies of warlike materials. Their great remaining difficulty appears to be money. They are posting placards throughout Turkestan, imploring people* not to believe lies circulated by* British Mission in Meshed regarding worthlessness of rouble notes. Being badly in need of many commodities only to be obtained from foreign countries, they are doing utmost to persuade foreign countries to accept their paper. They are said even to be offering large territorial concessions to Afghanistan and ' Bokhara in exchange for official recognition (?.of) paper money. Any propa ganda resulting in depreciation of that money is severe blow to Bolsheviks. There are many evidences of ceaseless activity of Bolsheviks in propaganda work. *Swarms pf agents are under intense training in various centres and will soon be let loose in neighbouring countries. Many are already at work, but far more are still to come. 33. M., 30th December. Tashkend. I have received lengthy /report, dated end &lt; of November* from my agent. He is Russian engineer, and is in touch with Bolshevik circles.. Much of his information we already know from wireless and other sources. Following are main points :—Large reinforcements of Red troops from Centre, who be'gan arriving early in November. General Brusiloff arrived Tashkend, 17th November. After capture of Krasnoyodsk, Bolsheviks will open up Kagan-Termez route. Bolsheviks all say it is settled policy to deal with Persia and India- in 1920. The new troops from Centre are very fine material. They were all told, when starting for Turkestan, that they were destined for Persia and India “ for the freeing of the East from the English yoke.” Bolshevik policy is to assist Pan-Islam agitation in every possible way. They have nothing in common with it, and eventually must openly break with Islam ; but for the present they regard it as very potent weapon against English. Economic situation, food, fuel and practically everything else being lacking, is yery serious. Everyone is nominally Bolshevik since others would quickly starve. But there are very few. sincere Bolsheviks, even amongst Russians, and practically none amongst Mahometans. All the parades, demonstrations, resolutions and tele grams to Lenin are engineered by Bolshevik officials, and in no way represent real convictions of inhabitants. There will be very severe famine in the towns this winter. The peasants have hidden stores of grain and can hold out longer. Bokhara and Khiva are largely under British direction, and thpir attitude to Bolsheviks is reserved. Bolsheviks will do utmost to persuade Afghans to renew war against India. Bitter anti-British propaganda is spreading every where. Nevertheless all population would .welcome British rule. F.S. 1729 S. (Extract), 22nd December. Foregoingis summary of theactual situation on frontier, but future hinges largely on attitude, of Afghanistan. We gauge this broadly as follows. Amir and Mahmud Tarzi are dominated by ambition to make Afghanistan strong independent State and to enlarge its boundaries, 727 D14 but do not fully realise weakness of its resources nor its economic dependence on India. They regard our Pushto-Speaking tribes as Afghanistan irredenta, which they hope ultimately to worry ns into ceding to them, but at same time we believe they regard prospects of expansion in Central Asia as most immediately hopeful. They aim at securing this if possible by friendly agreement with Bolsheviks. Latter appear anxious concerning Moscow, to have dropped their communistic principles for Central Asian purposes, and to be making hostility to British Empire sole condition of their friendship and support and to be using pan-Islamism as their main propaganda. This policy is helped by Mahmud Tarzi’s anti-British and pan-Islamic leanings. In order to win over Afghanistan, Bolsheviks are believed willipg to make considerable territorial concessions, but there are signs that Afghans may demand more than Bolsheviks are prepared to give and that serious friction may result between them. Amir’s policy aims at getting as much as possible out of Bolshevike and British simultaneously and at playing British off against Bolsheviks. He probably uses threats of British alliance and obstinate Turcomans as bogey to frighten Bolsheviks, just as he appears to be using threats of Bolshevik alliance and intrigues of Pathan tribes of North-Eastern Frontier (as) bogey to- frighten us. In this situation there are undoubtedly two dangers. First, that the Bolsheviks may* for the purpose of diverting Amir’s ambitions from Central Asia and embroiling him with'us, induce him fo join in attack on Persia, which they profess to wish to liberate from British dominance ; second, that any great development or success of pan-Islamic movement might sweep Afghans off their feet and cause them to attack us again with such aid from Bolsheviks as they can get. If, for instance, recent events 4n Mesopotamia were to end in Sheriffian party definitely joining anti-British and pan-Islamic movement under Turkish, suzerainty, and if announcement of Turkish peae'e terms were to cause great excitement ambngst Indian Moslems, then there might be risk of Afghan attack and of such i widespread disorder on frontier and in Persia and Mesopotamia that available troops would have, greatest difficulty' in coping with the situation. Our military advisers are so seriously impressed with this danger that they urge us to make immediate demands on-Amir to expel Bolsheviks, and cease- intrigues with tribes, and, if he refuses, to bring military.pressure to bear upon him. They state that they are at present able to deal with Afghanistan by itself before Airidis have committed themselves against us and while Indian Moslems are quiescent, as they are confident that troops now in Peshawar neighbourhood could hold that portion i of the frontier and that Amir would collapse under aerial attacks on Kabul‘and Jalalabad* &amp;c. If, however, we miss this present opportunity of either - stopping Afghan intrigues or disposing of’ Afghanistan by itself, widespread (? Afridi) rising and internal disorders may, they urge, coincide with or produce next spring or summer open declaration of' Afghan hostility.- Indian units, already below pre-war standards?owing to the officer difficulty, will, owing to necessity of granting leave, be below strength for many months, and British units will, not be fit for frontier service in hot- weather. Military authorities , doubt whether troops could then deal with situation thus aggravated at the worst season of the year from climatic point of’ view, especially for aerialoperations. While admitting force pf these arguments, we still consider that best chance .of avoiding trouble is.- to continue our present policy. We hope to have settled Waziristan by the .middle of February. This, we hope, may bring Afridis to their senses, and, in the meanwhile, friction between the Afghans and Bolsheviks, prospect of which Malleson constantly alludes to, may have definitely developed, Its developments would almost certainly be .^topped by our making sharp demands from Amir now, even if he were, ostensibly td comply with them, and would probably bring about very results which we wish to. avoid, viz., make him definitely join Bolsheviks and pan-Islamic camp next summer. On the other ha.nd, if things fnove in contrary directioii and Amir is by. mid die of February drifting into obviously more hostile attitude, there should still be time to force him to show his hand before hot weather sets in and before Central Asian climate admits of Bolsheviks helping him in Afghanistan or by serious movement in Central Asia. If we were then driven to hostilities, release of troops from Waziristan would place us. in a better military position, but even then we could not, until autumn, undertake more than local operations combined with aerial raids.15 Mr. Wardrop (Tiflis), 27th December, Ho. 234. Following from Colonel Stokes :— ‘‘ According to reliable information (? some) 1,500 Bolsheviks from Georgia and Azerbaijan are being sent via Baku to Persia. First 500 are now leaving Baku in small boats for Lenkoran, whence they will enter Persia by land. Persian Commissioner at Baku has asked his Government to take precaution on frontier, and is also, I understand, suggesting that two armed ships flying Persian flag, but with some British personnel, be placed on Caspian to guard Persian littoral, “ Question of control over Caspian Sea, in my opinion, demands immediate consideration. “Denikin’s fleet is unsatisfactory and is expected to join Bolsheviks if they take Krasnoyodsk. One ship already mutinied, resulting in disbandment of _ crew and execution of five ringleaders* . “ Bolshevik fleet prevented coming south only by lack of fuel. Unless prompt measures are taken, Bolphevik control of Caspian appears to be* probable at no distant date. “To avoid this, following alternatives are suggested :-t—‘ “(A) Take over from Denikin all or at least four of armed ships we gave him, and replace on them British personnel and run fleet as British. “(B) T&amp;ke over the four ship (? s from) Denikin and allot two each to Azerbaijan and Persia, giving them necessary British personnel. (C) Arm and commission three Caspian gunboats &lt;(? taken) last year (groups omitted) Astrabad, Kars, and Ardahan, now unused at Baku, manning them with partly British crews. “ If feasible, alternative (A) is recommended. “In addition, in order to give Azerbaijan badly needed assurance that Baku will not be at mercy of armed ships on Caspian, whether Bolshevik or Denikin, I strongly urge breechblocks of two 6-inch guns mounted by us at Baku be handed over to Azerbaijan Government with sufficient ammunition for use in case of attack from sea. Breechblocks believed to be at Constantinople.” I concur, : and as regards last paragraph would suggest breechblocks and ammunition be conveyed to Batoum immediately to be held in readiness for transport to Baku in case of need. Mr. Wardrop (Tiflis), 27th December, No. 237. Situation in Trans-Caspia and its bearing on Trans-Caucasus causes me some anxiety. Bolsheviks' evidently intend to take Krasnovodsk. They are sending numerous agents to Caucasus and Persia with large funds, including forged Bradburys, and are trying to buy over the Turcomans. He has seen their two leaders, who are co-operating with Volunteer Army, but inefficiency of latter and ill-treatment of troops have alienated their sympathy. They ask British support (? for their) claims of future independence, and declare they could form anti- Bolshevik barrier from Caspian to Merv threatening enemy’s communications. He says His Majesty’s Government refused four months ago to entertain proposals for British protectorate or small British Mission, but thinks matter worthy of reconsideration in view of present danger to Persia and Caucasus. Saiid Zia Uddin considers threat to Persia serious, and says several com missaries at Askabad are Persians, and Bolsheviks are active in Persia. Colonel Stokes could get into touch with Turcomans through Saiid Persian Commissioner in Baku if authorised, and he has suggested present telegram as matter is urgent. Small vessels have resumed regular sailings from Baku to Enzeli and Krasnovodsk. I do not feel competent to express decided opinion on above, especially as I am not thoroughly aware of extent of Afghan activity in Central Asia. I could not go further than to submit that sending British Mission to Turcomans to enquire and report might have temporary good effect in Trans-Caspia. F.S. 1763 S. 28th December. As regards Northern Persia we consider we must expect gradual accession of strength to Bolsheviks in Central Asia during the winter months, and that if Krasnovodsk is captured, and defection of Caspian fleet follows, there is reason to believe expedition against Persia will be seriously undertaken. Maximum numbers which might be available for this purpose next spring we16 put at 30,000, bu|t mimbers that could be employed in Persia,; at distauce from railway or Caspian littoral are limited by supply and transport, which are both very difficult. Given command by Bolsheviks of Caspian we think expedition would probably take form of descent on sea there and threatening of Persian communications between Tehran and Khorasan. If Caspian is denied to Bolsheviks we doubt whether military expedition in any force could be under taken against Khorasan'frontier, but they might attempt to penetrate gradually from railway towards Astrabad to Bujnurd, preparing ground by intense propa ganda and securing co-operation of local tribes. If Afghans did not, obstruct passage of Bolsheviks they might threaten line of communications of-our Meshed force Kushk and Herat. As regards Northern Persia, War Office and Baghdad are best judges. Situation has been aggravated by failure of Denikin’s operations and risings in Azerbaijan, Daghestan and, Georgia, and. as far as we can see, this whole region will be open to Bolshevist penetration once they have secured Krasnovodsk and command of Caspian. We appreciate, therefore, Cox’s 'anxiety in his telegram 747 of 21st November, but it appears to us that we are not at present in a position to protect Northern Persia effectively from Bolshevik incursion by military force, nor to reassert Persian authority outside (? sphere) of our forces at Meshed and Kasvin. This is very strong argument for expediting formation of new Persian force and for improving our military position by extending our railheads to Neh and Kermanshah respectively. We must, however, emphasise fact that neither our army in India nor our force in Mesopotamia has been organised with any idea of affording military support to Persia and are consequently inadequate for the purpose. To make them adequate would involve an expenditure which we are quite unable to meet at present. But if we could obtain naval command of Caspian we think it would afford a better defence of Persia against Bolshevik aggression than any military measures we can take for the purpose* To effect such command it would be necessary to regain control of Caspian fleet, and to move naval personnel and guns thither, but .we cannpt say whether this could be done from Black Sea, via Batpum and Tiflis, withput a military expeditipn. We managed this in 1918 frem Baghdad, and cpuld presumably dp it again, but Force “ D ” would prcbably have tp receive assistance in mechanical transport and other ways, extent of which MacMunn alone could say after he has received estimate of men and material to be transported.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000788.0x00035e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/A186</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x00035e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/A186</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Central Asia, Persia, Afghanistan, &amp;c.
