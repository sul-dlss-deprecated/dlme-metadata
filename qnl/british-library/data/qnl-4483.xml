PRECIS MEKEAN AFFAIRS. BY J. A. 8ALDANEA, B.A., LL.B. I CALCUTTA: OFFICE OP THE SUPERINTENDENT OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING, INDIA. 1905.PREFACE. rpHIS Precis covers correspondence dealing with that portion of Mekran, which comes within the control of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, embracing the coast districts of Persian-Baluchistan through which the telegraph line passes, that is, from Gwettar Bay to Jask, and also the port of Gwadur held by the Sultan of Maskat in British Mekran. The earlier corre spondence, however, about the Persian encroachments in Baluchistan is so inextricably mixed up with the history of other districts that the Precis over steps the above limits somewhat at the outset. It must be mentioned that Chapters II and IV to VI dealing with this subject are borrowed mainly from Colonel Goldsmid's memorandum (Foreign Department Proceedings, Political A, June 1869, Nos. 357-358). Before reading this Precis, a perusal of Captain Ross's memorandum on Mekran (printed at the Education Society's Press, Byculla, in 1868) and the historical and descriptive chapter on Baluchistan in Volume IX of Aitchison's Treaties, would be a great help in getting a better insight into the correspondence. The following subjects connected with Mekran affairs are treated in separate Precis:— Disturbances of the Rinds in the Slave Trade Precis, Chapter V. Traffic in Arms in the Arms Trade Precis. J. A.

(i) Task, our port of trade with Persia from 1615 to 1633. The Mekran coast was the earliest field of British enterprise in Persia. It was at Jask, then ' only a fisher town,' that the pioneers of the British trade with Persia landed, and from there commenced their arduous march to Ispahan. Jask was the port for the export and import trade in Persia that was carried on by the East India Company's merchants until Gombroon was opened to them on the fall of the Portuguese power in the gulf after the capture of Ormuz in 1622. Por a description of Jask and the coast from there to Minab, and of enterprises of the English in that region, attention is invited to the first and second parts of the Summary attached to the Selections from the State Fapers (1600—1880). (ii) Captain Grant's mission to Mekran, 1809. 2. After the British had established a factory at Gombroon, Jask and the Mekran coast was abandoned altogether and was not thought of for nearly two centuries. It was only at the commencement of the nineteenth century, that the scare of a French invasion opened our eyes to the possibilities of the Mekran coast offering an easy way to an army marching from Persia to India. Captain Grant, who was in command of the escort of Brigadier-General Malcolm, was sent to the Mekran coast. The object of this mission is described . in the following extract of his letter to Bombay, Volume 80 of 1864 (Persia). gil . H _ Worsele y on his return from his journey through Mekran :— ' The object of my late mission was to ascertain whether an European army could penetrate into India by the southern coast of Persia ; for which purpose I landed at Clioubar, aud finished my journey at Gombroon. &lt;f From this judgment I could form, I conceive, the design perfectly practicable; the great obstacle that was supposed to exist was the scarcity of water, but I found such idea was erroneous. ' I travelled in my European dress, and found the inhabitants more civil and hospitable than they had been represented. I made the purchase of a few horses, the ostensible object of my journey.^ 3. The journal of his route contains valuable information about the state Printed in Bombay Volume 80 of 1864, with a of the Country, its towns, tribes and chiefs, ma P' and is therefore printed below in externa * J ournal of a route through the western parts of Meier an hy Captain N. P. Grant. J ournal. Having received instructions from Brio-adier-General Malcolm to examine the western countries of Mekran, I embarked on board the Honourable Company's Cruiser Ternat q '* and sailed on the 18th of January 1809 from Bombay. 4626 F. D.2 t 0 s b Jamarv 25^.-Arrived at Gwadur, but on inquiry the country was found in sucli aH unsettled state, that Captain Seton thought it advisable I should land further up the co 8 . January at Gwuttur, a village belonging to Mir ^ ^nsists of about 150 mat-huts, and a small mud-fort. The inhabitants are chiefly fisherme , exchange their surplus for grain from the interior : there is not the slightest cultivation about the nlace Water is procured by digging two or three feet in the sand, but after a s r time it becomes brackish. Two nullahs fall into the sea at this place ; one from Champ and Dustyari, the other from Surbaz and Bawu; they are dry, except during ie ramy s s commencing in November, and continuing three or four months. ^ February 1^.—Marched to Nagor; the first two miles over a swamp, occasioned by the discharge of water from the nullahs; the remainder of the road over a barren plain, except within two or three miles o£ Nagor, where some slight signs of This village consists of about 250 mat-huts and a small mud-fort. The countiy to the northward of it, for about a mile, abounds in wells, and produces dates, tobacco and cotton , but beyond this it is a mere desert. Na^or is the residence of Mir Solan, whose territory extends from Jewani, on the bay of Gwuttur to Choubar, and about forty miles inland. This countiy is generally termed Bawu Dustyari, being the names of his two largest villages. Hu tube is ^9^ and * originally from near Sind, the language of which country they M retain. The foices o this Chief amount to about 300 cavalry and 8,000 infantry; but the whole of these could only be collected on an actual invasion of his country; their arms are the match-lock and sword. His revenue is about 6,000 rupees. Thistribe is of greater weight in Mekran than any other, its alliance being courted by all the neighbouring Chiefs. I was furnished with letters from Captain Seton, to Mir Soban, and from their influence was received with every attention; indeed, that I was able to perform this ]ourney at all, can only be ascribed to the high respect Captain SeWs * name is held in throughout all Mekran. The produce of the country is wheat, joari and cotton, but the crops depend on the rains for water; there is generally one barren year out of three—this of 1808-09 was the unlucky one. In a plentiful season enough is produced for two or three years con sumption. February 7^.—Marched ten-and-a-half miles towards Choubar, to await the arrival of letters of credit from Muscat; the road very bad through ravines; no wells, but plenty of water lodg«d in hollows. February 8a.—Road for ten miles as yesterday; thence to nineteen over the plain of Cambel, quite barren for want of rain; Tizcopan is a small village lying at the toot of the hill ; at the twenty-second mile ascended the hill and halted; ram-watei piocurable only from hollows. February 9th .—The road to three miles over the hill, and very rugged to Choubar ; six-and-a-half miles, road good. This place consists of about 300 mat-huts, and a mud-fort built on a slight eminence on the east side of an extensive bay. The countiy round about is quite barren, except a few gardens; near the town good water is procured from wells sunk in the bed of a nullah twelve or fifteen feet: deep. There is a continual intercourse between Chouhar and Muscat; ghee and cotton are the chief exports; it is likewise the mart where the inland countries barter their produce. No great quantity oi provisions could be furnished without some previous notice ; but after a plentiful year, and with one mont s preparation, a very large supply of grain and dates could be collected. Sheep, goats, and camels are easily procurable. The duties of this place amount to o,000 rupees; this was formerly divided between the Syed of Muscat and some of the Meter an Chief s t but the Syed has now seized the fort, and retains the whole. February Marched six-and-a-half miles to Tiz, formerly a place of some import ance, but of which nothing now remains but fifty or sixty miserable huts. It lies m a valley about half a mile broad and two miles long, surrounded by steep hills, except to the south where it is open to the sea. There are but two roads leading into the val ey, the one from the west between the sea and the hills, and the other ovei the hills tiom Choubar; they are both well fortified. February 18th. —Received my letters of credit from Muscat, but no bills above rupees 200 were procurable on the inland towns. FeSrwary Marched towards Na^or—the road to Tizeopan is the same as before described—thence over a plain; halted at twenty-six miles; some scatteied cultivation for the five last miles ; water procurable only from hollows. February 22nd. — Road leads over a plain for six miles to seventeen miles over hilli and through ravines; to Nagor, twenty miles over a plain. This route is the longest but best from Choubar, but it has no water in the hot weatlier. After procuring letters from Mir Soban to the Chiefs of the country, I pursued my journey inland. My letters purported that I had come to Nagor to purchase horses, but none being procurable of the kind I wanted, had proceeded inland in hopes of being more fortunate. * Captain Soion of the Bombay establishment was Resident at Muscat and Luvoy to Sind.February 25th —Marched towards Kusserkund at four miles, palms and water to six over a plain ; at twelve over steep hills; at eighteen over the plain of Dustyari; halted on the banks of the Kaju nullah. This plain is about fifteen miles broad and twenty long, and in favourable seasons is remarkable for its fertility. The Kaju^intersects it from north to soulhj but only furnishes water for irrigation during the rains. r lhe inland inhabitantf are scattered about in hamlets of eight or ten huts each. Water in plenty on the road, and procured by digging two or three feet in the nullah. February 26th. —The road to eleven-and-a-half miles over a plain; here the cultivated part of Dustyari ends to fifteen, among hills; Pir Dastgir, a small village with water ; at ninfteen-and-a-half entered the Kaju nullah; halted at twenty-two ; water from a cleft in the rocks. The road to-day good till entering the nullah; through it stony and difficult. February 27th. —Marched twenty-four-and-a-half miles over hills and through the Kaju in which we halted; water as yesterday, but none on the road. February 2Sth, —The road, to twelve miles, through a nullah; to sixteen through a stony valley ; to nineteen over a plain to Kusserkund; there are no villages for the last three days^ journey. The road lies mostly in the bed of the Kaju, which is generally half-a-mile broad; the country on both sides is covered with high hills of barren rocks ; these hills are thinly inhabited by Beloochis, whose flocks find a scanty subsistence in the beds of the nullahs. Kusserkund lies in a fertile valley, about twenty -one-and-a-half miles broad, having th e Kaju nullah running through it ; the cultivated part is about eight miles in circumference. The town stands on the west side, and consists of about 500 huts and a large mud-fort; water is plentifully supplied from twenty-five large springs on the north side of the valley. Wheat, rice and dates are produced in the greatest luxuriance; the wheat in Mekran is reaped in the end of March or beginning of April; dates in June, and rice in September. The Chief of this place, ShaiJc Samandar, is independent, and besides the immediate district of Kusserkund possesses some little territory to the north; but his whole revenue does not exceed 1,000 rupees a year ; the inhabitants are about 3,000 men. At Kusserkund I met Mahomed Khan, the Chief of Gaih ; he was the only person under whose protection I could proceed further inland, but as he was going to Nagor, I was obliged to await his return, that I might be furnished with proper persons to accompany me. Alarch 17th. —Mahomed Khan having returned, I accompanied him, and marched towards Gaih ; at four-and-a-half miles reached Heit, a fine village with a fort, belonging to the Chief of Bug ; at nine miles Bug, a short distance on the left; these two places are well supplied with spring water, and abound in palms ; they lie on the banks of the Kaju ; the chief is Mir Mohibbie, whose revenue is not above 500 rupees. The road to eleven miles lies in the Kaju; the remainder to Gaih, forty-one miles, is over hills and through ravines; Gaih is situated between two nullahs coming from the east, and a third, larger from the north, into which the two former fall. All these nullahs abound in springs, some of them hot. The town consists of about 600 huts, and a large high mud-fort, situated close on the banks of the large nullah; it is reckoned the second city in Mekran, Keij being the first', and its dependencies are of greater extent than those of any other State ; they stretch from the ChoubarlOO miles along the sea coast, and eighty miles inland. The revenue of this Chief is not above 4,000 rupees a year, and he is able to collect about 3,500 armed men from his own districts and those of the petty Chiefs with whom he is on a good footing. This State was formerly much subject to be plundered by the tribes on the borders of Mekran and Persia, but it has for a few years enjoyed peace from these depredations. March 21st. —Marched towards Bunpoor. The road this day was fourteen miles, over hills and through ravines, to Hechan, a fine village with a fort, situated on the banks of a nullah; its lands are well cultivated and watered; the inhabitants are about 2,000. Ihe dependencies of Gaih extend thus far. At this place I met with a person who had assumed the character of a Syed^, and was travelling over Mekran and the adjacent countries; he understood most of the oriental languages, and some of the European. I could discover nothing from him at this time; he afterwards sent me a note, saying he was an Armenian, but I could not find out whether he was employed by any one. March 22nd. —Marched to Sarhi 21 miles ; the road to-day is exceedingly steep and difficult through the Hechan nullah; it has a stream of water flowing the whole way. This is one of the passes into Mekran from the north; there are eight of these passes between Minab and Kelat-i-Sewir, and they are all so difficult that the passage might be obstructed by a very small body of men. The greatest elevation of the Mekran mountains is attained at this place; the streams to the south flowing towards the Indian Ocean, and those to the north towards the Gulf of Persia. March 23rd. —At six-and-a-half miles Oghin, a small village with water and palms ; at thirteen miles Peib, a fort, and a chief town of the valley of Lashar. This valley is about eio-ht miles broad and twenty-five long, and had a number of fine villages abounding with palms, but from the tyranny of the Bunpoor Chief, to whom it is tributary, it is now much on the decline; it can furnish 500 good soldiers. At nineteen miles Gordor, a small village and fort; at twentv-six halted; the road for eight miles through ravines, thence through the nullah of Last &gt;r, springs of water in most parts.4 March 2411.—hi two miles, Esfaca, a large village and fort; at fourteen quit the* Lashar nullah, and enter on sand-hills; at twenty-seven miles, Gizkok, a halting place, but no village ; the water brackish: numerous flocks amongst the adjacent sand-hills. March 25th. —At ten miles, the Bunpoor nullah, with a stream of water twenty yards wide and three feet deep. The sands extend thus far: at thirteen miles, Bunpoor. The fort of Bunpoor is situated on an extensive plain, and from the height of the mound of earth on which it is built, is visible at the distance of twenty-five miles ; it is of mud, small and crowded with buildings. The town contains only a few huts occupied by the Chiefs relations and dependants. The inhabitants in general live in huts, scattered about as their flocks and cultivation call their attention. The immediate district of Bunpoor is about five miles broad and thirty long, stretching from east to west, and being well watered with springs, produces grain in such abundance as to supply most of the neighbouring countries. It has a desert of land of about twenty-five miles broad on each side of it; that on the south is bounded by the Mekran range of hills, and that on the north, by a range running parallel. The present possessors of Bunpoor invaded it twenty-five years ago, and dispossessing the former inhabitants, settled themselves. They are called Narrois, from their former country, Narro, about 250 miles E. N. E. of Bunpoor. Their force, when collected, is about 300 cavalry, well armed and mounted, and 2,500 infantry. Their chief employment is plunder, their expeditions being generally directed to the westward, extending to Minab and Bunder Abbas. The inhabitants and cattle constitute the chief spoil, the former are sold as slaves to merchants from Candahar, who bring horses in return. These expeditions have been, in some measure, checked, since the settling of one of the Persian Shah-Zadehs in Kerman, about three years ago. The Beloochis of Lower Mekran are not so accustomed to rapine as the tribes inhabiting the borders of Candahar and Persia; the fear of whose ravages obliges travellers, of whom the greatest part are pilgrims from the Punjab and Cabool, to take the route of Sind, and thence to travel through Mekran. From the bad character of the Bunpoor Chief, I found it impracticable to penetrate to Minab by the direct route; I therefore returned into Mekran by the pass of Champ. April Marched eight miles to Gwarpusht, a small village, with springs and palms ; the road is crossed by the Bunpoor nullah, which loses itself in the sands about forty miles west of Bunpoor. April ,2/^.—The road leads over a desert for twenty-one miles to Shurda, a fountain in the hills; to twenty-six over sand skirting the hills; to thirty-six over hills; halted at Surmich, a small fort and village ; it has a well-watered spot of about four miles in circum ference, and depends on Bunpoor. April 3rd. —At six miles attained the summit of the hills, where there is a very narrow pais, whence the descent though slight is to the south, by the Kaju nullah, which takes its rise about this spot; at nine miles. Champ, a short distance on the right: it is the residence of an independent Chief, and can raise 1,000 excellent soldiers. The name of the Chief is Mir Ouba ; the principal produce o£ the country is very fine dates. Halted at Tank thirty-three miles ■, water was rather scarce the latter part of the road. April 4th. —Marched twenty-three miles through the Kaju nullah. The banks skirted with palms and houses the whole way. The descent this day is great but gradual. April 5th. —At sixteen miles, Kusserkund. The road as yesterday, and plenty of water • at twenty-six miles Bug. The pass from Bunpoor into Mekran by Kusserkund is longer, but much easier than that by Gaih; forage for horses is scarce on this road. April 6th. —Marched twelve miles towards Gaih. April 7^. —Marched to Gaih, nineteen miles, being obliged to go to Choubar to pay for the horses I had purchased at Bunpoor; I left my followers at Gaih wishing to pursue a route as far from the coast as possible. April 8th. —Marched from Gaih, the road leading through nullah; at ten miles, the Hechan nullah joins, they fall into the sea between Buzem and Tank, thirty miles west of Choubar; at thirty-three miles, quitted the nullah, which had water flowing most of the way and is in many places skirted with palms ; to thirty-five miles through bills and ravines; to forty-one miles over plains : halted at a nullah with water. April 9th. -The road to twenty-one miles among hills and ravines. Here commence the plains. A nullah with water at seventeen miles ; at thirty-six miles Parag, a small village with water from wells ; at forty-three, Nun Khor, a salt water river, unfordable when the tide is in; at forty-eight miles, Tiz. Some part of the plains had been cultivated, but from want of rain the crop was scanty: on this road there are few inhabitants. April lOth. —Marched to Choubar, and having transacted my business, returned in the evening to Tiz. April 11th. —Marched forty-eight miles towards Gaih : the road as before described. April 12th.—Ki Gaih, forty-one miles. The direct road to Minab through Buskurd being too mountainous for camels and horse-!, I was obliged to pursue the route of Jask. April IS'k. —The road through a nullah of ten miles ; to thirteen miles over hills, crossed the Hechan nullah, halted at Petab, twenty-eight miles, a small village with palms and water. No inhabitants on the road ; but plenty of water.6 April 14th, —At sixteen miles, Wajbis, a small village with water ; at twenty-six miles, halted at Korandab, no village but plenty of water and forage : the road this day leads through a large nullah abounding in forage. The nullah of Beint joins here. April 15th. —At sixteen miles, Zengin, a small village with water; at twenty-seven miles, halted at Pashin. Forage and water plenty. The road continues in the same nullah as yesterday. April 16th. —Road to nine miles over stony plains to the wells of Balug ; at nineteen crossed the nullah with water in it; at twenty-six miles, halted at Karwan, on the banks of a branch of the same nullah. This day's march leads over the plains between the sea and mountains. The inhabitants reside in temporary huts, which are removed from place to place for the convenience of forage ; the flocks of camels and sheep being very numerous. April 17th. —At nine miles, the wells of Kashi in a nullah; at thirty-four miles, the wells of Suruk; no water on the road between these stations. April 18^.—At eleven miles, Sudeich, a village with palms and water; at fourteen miles&gt; a nullah ; at seventeen miles, Malike Chadig, a high mound of stones, marking the boundary of Mekran ; here the territory of Gaih ends, and that of Jask commences; at twenty-two miles, Himend, a small village and well; and twenty-nine miles, Gabrig and a nullah, with the wells sunk in the bed. April Marched to Jagin, twenty-one miles ; no water on the road, but plenty from the nullah at the halting place. April 20th. —At ten miles, a nullah with wells, but the water brackish ; at eighteen miles, the hills extend to the sea ; at twenty-six miles, Jask, a few palm plantations on the road ; Jask lies about two miles from the sea, and eight from the hills. The town consists of about 250 huts with a mud-fort, but is now almost deserted, owing to a pestilential fever having raged here for some months. The Chief has removed his residence to Senk, about eighty miles off. The water is from wells, and mostly brackish. The country around to some distance has been cultivated, but is now much neglected. In the last five days' journey over the plains, a number of spots had been cultivated, but the crops had mostly failed for want of rain. Forage for horses everywhere abounds. April 21st. —At seven miles, Bamadi, a small village with palms and wells ; at twenty miles amongst hills ; at twenty-eight miles, Surks, a cultivated plain with palms and water; at thirty-three miles, halted at Shirahan, a large village deserted ; water good and in plenty from wells: the hills in these parts are not so crowded as in Mekran, but admit a free and good passage between them. April 22nd. —Halted. April 23rd- —At seven miles, a nullah with salt water; at ten miles, Go, a small village with water and cultivation ; at seventeen miles, Bareizg, water bad and scarce; at twenty-five miles, Sekoe, a large village and fort; at thirty.one miles, Nemudi, a large village and fort; at thirty-seven miles, Guz, a large village ; at thirty-eight-and-a-half miles, a nullah which, as rain had fallen in the adjacent hills, had a current of water in it; at about forty-six miles, Serik, the residence of Mir Haji, Chief of Jask. It contains about 600 huts and a large mud- fort, and is four miles from the sea, and six from the hills of Buskurd. From Shirahan to Gero, the country called Beaban, is better inhabited and cultivated than any other in these parts, and, indeed, on the whole way from J ask the plantations of palm are numerous, and the wheat harvest had been tolerably abundant. The wells in these parts, though numerous, do not supply much water, and a number of them are brackish. Forage is scarce near the road, but abundant on the sands close to the sea-shore. Jask is tributary to the Imaum of Muskat and pays 2,500 rupees yearly : the inhabitants are Beloochis. Quite up to Minab their language approaches nearer to the Persian than that of the eastern Beloochis, which is more intermixed with Sind.

April 25U.—At two miles, Teroe, a small fort and village ; at. six miles, Gero, a large village and fort, a nullah runs close to it. The dependencies of J ask extend thus far ; at thirteen miles, hills extend to the sea; at twenty-five miles, Kohistag, a fort built on an insulated hill on the sea-shore ; the wells are on the beach ; halted at twenty-eight miles water and forage in plenty. The hills retire from Kohistag behind Minab, and do not approach the sea again till beyond Bunder Abbas. April 26th. —At five miles, a salt nullah; at eighteen miles, the cultivated parts of Minab ; at nineteen miles, Balili, on the banks of the Minab nullah; at twenty-seven miles halted at Hukmi. The fort of Minab is situated partly on a hill, is of little or no strength, and is divided into the upper centre and lower forts ; the town is large and the houses built close to the fort, in a much more commodious manner than any I have yet met with. The nullah breaks through the hills and forms a pass from the eastward. It and the cuts made to diffuse its waters, serve as ditches to the fort; water flows here continually, but is all consumed in fertilizing the lands, none reaching the sea, although only sixteen miles distant. Tne culti vated parts of Minab are about forty-five miles in circumference, abounding in palms. This district likewise supplies grain to most of the neighbouring country; its villages are numerous, each having a small fort for the inhabitants to retire to in case of unexpected 4626 F. D.6 invasion. Minab would be a most convenient place for an army to halt at, to refresh and collect its provisions; forage is so abundant that the cattle of the neighbouring countries are sent in great numbers to remain here during the hot season. The Chiefs name is U hoi am Ali r hyt he is quite dependent on the Imaum of Muscat who receives about 30,000 rupees yearly for this district, and keeps a small garrison in the fort. Although not paying revenue direct to Persia, Minab may he considered as part of that kingdom ; the neighbouring Persian Chiefs are on a good footing with it, and lend their force and protection against its disturbers, April 27th. —Halted. i April 28th. —At seven miles, the cultivated parts of Minab, and at twenty-height mile a cistern and caravanserai, but both much out of repair; at thirty-three miles, the nullah of Koventi J at forty-three miles, a salt nullah ; at fifty miles, Maknokha, a small village and fort, with wells and cultivation. The road to Maknokha over a barren salt plain ; at fifty-six miles, Bunder Abbas. Bunder Abbas is in the possession of the Syed of Muscat, it, is fortified with several walls within each other without ditches. The country around is barren, and the water bad. A good trade is carried on from the interior, the caravans arriving in the cold weather during which time grain is procurable in large quantities •, the customs amount to 20,000 rupees, for which, and the Minab tribute, the Imaum of Muscat partly accounts to Persia. There are three roads from Minab to Bunder Abbas; the centre, by which I travelled, another by the sea-shore, and a third at the foot of the hill; the last is most frequented, having a number of villages and a good supply of water. The principal object of my journey having been to ascertain whether it were possible for a European army to penetrate through this country to Sind, I will proceed to deliver my ideas on that subject. There are two routes by which this might be effected; the first, by marching east from Minab, and entering Mekran by the pass of Rumishk or Fanoch, and continuing the route by Beint, Graih and Keij, at the distance of 90 or 100 miles from the coast, till it falls into the road leading to Kurrachee from the inland countries. The commencement of this route, that is, from Minab to Fanoch, has, from all reports, plenty of water, and indeed the old road from Choubar to Minab formerly led by Fanoch. In the whole tract between Rumishk and where the route joins the Kurrachee road, water is plentiful. The country produces dates in considerable abundance; flocks are met with, but not very numerous ; grain is scarce. This route would be almost impass able , to artillery from the mountainous nature of the greatest part of it; it would be best adapted to infantry, as furnishing a sure supply of water and a considerable quantity of provisions, which could never fail altogether, as the palm-trees offer a sure resource at all seasons. It would be advisable for no larger bodies than 5,000 men to move together, as the roads are in some places very difficult. The second route is along the sea coast by Jask and Choubar to Corachey ;* this route is nearly uniform the whole way over plains, between the sea and mountains; in the part of it that I travelled over, I experienced no want of water, except in a small tract of forty miles between Shirahan and Serik, where the water is soon dried up in the wells, but this is of less consequence as they are numerous. Little or no rain had fallen this year, and yet the nullahs always afforded a large supply of water. Provisions would not be procurable, unless precautions had been taken to collect them at Choubar or Gwadur, but flocks, both of camels and sheep, are numerous. This road would be best adapted to artillery and cavalry from its level nature and from furnishing everywhere supplies of forage for horses. The troops should move in bodies not exceeding 2,000 or 3,000 ; the water at many of the stations being confined to one spot. The opposition of the natives might impede, but not obstruct this passage ; it would most eftectually be offered in the upper route where irregular troops might continually skirmish, in the plains it would avail nothing ; I do not think any would be offered excent instigated by some foreign power, and to effect this no difficulty exists. „ ^ kran J 6 divided among a number of petty Chiefs, the principal are those of Bunpoor Lraih, Bawu, Surbaz, Keij, Dizec, Penjgore and Bala—the three former have alreadv been mentioned. Surbaz lies about fifty miles E. S. E. of Bunpoor, and commands one of the passes leading into Mekran. This State was formerly of much greater power than at present, holding the whole country down to the sea, including Bawn and Dustyari The lower districts have lately been wrested from it by the Jedgale, a tribe which the ancestors of the present Chief, Mir Dostin, invited from near Bala, and settled here to enable themselves to resist the power of Keij; its chief places are seated on the nullah which passes Bawu. Keij is reckoned the chief city of Mekran, and lies 120 miles east of usserkund, opposite one of the passes; its power is now merely confined to a small district th e : r s the i 0 T rrJ 0 ' lar ^ bei ^ held by a ? overDor from Khelat-i-Sewir; the smaller by the Chief Marrab Khan ; he is of a tribe called Gijki, from the name of a town some days^ journey N of E.

In their plundering expeditions they have been known to move upwards of 200 miles in three days, sweepi ng the country of its inhabitants and cattle. The territory of * Kurrachi.7 Dizec is a mixture of plains and hills. Penj»ore lies 100 miles J). N. E. of Dizec, and is still tributary to Khelat ; its territory is mountainous. Bala is a short distance inland from Lonemeany ;* the inhabitants are in a better state than most of Belooehis. Buskurd, which belongs to Kerman, lies at the western extremity of Mekran, and occupies the nook of land which projects into the Indian Ocean, and forms one side of the entrance of the Gulf of Persia, leaving a small extent of plain between the mountains and the sea; it is the most moun tainous in these parts, and is inhabited by a brave and hardy race, who sometimes infest the lower roads towards Minab ; it yields excellent dates, and carpets of a mixture of cotton and wool are its chief manufacture : springs of water abound through it. Mekran was conquered by Nassar Khan, Chief of Khelat-i-Sewir ; but on his death, about fifteen years ago,t either his sou's indolence, or the country producing little advantage, has caused this authority to be relinquished, and the present Chief has only possession of a fort at Keij. Braovi is the name of the Khelat tribe, and they are in a better state of civilization than any of the Beloochis; a considerable intercourse subsists with Candahar, Kurrachee, aud Hyderabad. The climate of Khelat is so cold that there is snow four months in the year. The whole force of Mekran, exclusive of Khelat, may amount to about 25,000 men, but in the present state of things, it would be impossible to make them act together ; indeed, the country has not resources to maintain them in a body for any considerable time ; when a Chief takes the field, he summons his vassals, who are obliged to attend him forty days at their own cost j but in general, the affair is decided in twelve or fifteen days. Instead of pay, these men are assessed at a lower rate than the other inhabitants, and are frequently altogether exempted. As soldiers, the Beloochis are neither remarkable for great bravery nor for a deficiency of that quality, but in general, they might be reckoned steady men j they are very expert with the matchlock, which, with a sword, shield and large knife forms their equipment; they seldom quit their houses unarmed. A great number of them are employed by the Arabs in their dows and ships of Muscat, and they are reckoned very faithful. The lower and central countries of Mekran are chiefly employed in agriculture, the manufacture of cloths and attention to their flocks. They are, I think, a quiet and well- disposed people; the Beloochis of the hills, who lead a savage life, apart from the towns, sometimes infest the roads; in the higher countries the inhabitants are more inured to blood and rapine, esteeming attention to their lands as an object of much less importance than arms, but I found them hospitable, and a manly freedom characterizes them; they are a more robust and braver race than the southern tribe, and so much have they prevailed in all their contests, that the name of a Narroi strikes terror through Mekran. In the above remarks nothing that has fallen under my own observation has been misstated ,* whatever has been received from report, has been carefully selected, but should there be any errors under this head, they must plead for their excuse, the circumstances under which the information was collected, (Signed) N.

'We are first brought in the nineteenth century in political contact with the Chiefs of what now constitutes the Persian Baluchistan in connection with the project of a telegraph line by land to Bunder Abbas. Our earlier attempts in 1861—62—63, to construct a line along the coast even as far as Gwadur, were thwarted by the Persian Governor of Bampur, and the project for continuation of the line from Gwadur to Bunder Abbas had to be postponed owing to Persian opposition among other reasons. (i) Reverend Mr. Badger's Reports. 5. We have an interesting report in connection with the country through which the telegraphic line was projected from the pen of Heverend Mr. George Percy Badger (in charge of the Muscat-Zanzibar Commission), addressed to the Bombay Government (No. 9, dated 3rd June 1861), which, throwing as it does much light on the previous history of the province, is quoted at length below : — Agreeably with the instractions conveyed to me in your letter, No. 1697, of 1861, I took advantage of my late visit to Muscat to collect all available information respecting- the coast from Bunder Abbas to Kurrachee bearing in any way on the suggested line of Electric Telegraph between those places, to be extended from Bunder Abbas to Basra or Bagdad. I was fortunate in fiuding at Muscat several very intelligent Beloochi Chiefs, who were well acquainted with the social and political condition of the intermediate countries, and whose statements have enabled me to form a tolerable estimate of the difficulties, as well as of the facilities, attached to the proposed scheme: these I shall now proceed to set forth for the information of the Hon'ble the Governor in Council. 2. The territory between Bunder Abbas and Sudrej, a place on the coast, about sixty miles eastward of the small town of Jask, is at present under the jurisdiction of Syed Thoweynee of Muscat, who holds it in farm from the Persian Government, under the conditions of the Treaty*concluded with that Government by His late Highness Syed Saeed in 1856. M^er Hossein, the existing Governor of Jask, on the part of His Highness Syed Thoweynee, and wh &gt;m 1 saw at Muscat, informed me that the country between Jask and Bunder Abbas was here and there well cultivated, especially in the vicinity of the villages, and afforded, moreover, extensive oasturage grounds for the numerous fl 'cks kept by the Beloochis. He gave the following as the principal villages on the ordinary route between Jask and Bunder Abbas ;— From Jask to Koh (Moobarek) „ Koh to Gattan . „ Gattan to Sereck „ Sereck to Gran (Gron) „ Gron to Kustack . „ Kustack to Minab „ Minab to Bunder Abbas 6 hours. 1 hour. 18 hours. H „ 6 „ 12 „ 12 „ Meer Hossein represented the inhabitants of this district as quiet and peaceable, and saw no difficulty whatever in the establishment of the Electric Telegraph along that line of the coast if Syed Thoweynee undertook to protect it, and if the Persian Government sanctioned the enterprise. 3. His Highness Syed Thoweynee has officially intimated to Government t bis readiness to co-operate in the undertaking wherever his t See his letter to Sir George Clerk in my ™ S( iiotion extended, and he repeatedly assured Eeport, No. 6, o s . une. me ^ ^ to p^tect the line from Bunder Abbas to Jask and Sudrej if not interfered with by the Persians. This latter proviso comprises a consideration of serious importance in connection with the suggested scheme, since, according to the conditions of the Treaty referred to in paragraph 2, the Sultan of Muscat is bound to exclude the Agents of any foreign Government from the territories comprised within the limits of the farm ; and by the general tenor of the Articles of that Treaty, His Highness is obviously deprived of the prerogative of granting an absolute permission for such an undertaking as the Electric Telegraph between Bunder Abbas and Sudrej. The correctness of this reference will be apparent to the Government after a perusal of the Treaty itself, which I purpose attaching to my letter No. 10, dated 5th June 1861, * For a general account of the construction of the telegraph line in the Persian Gulf and along the Mekvan Coa4 see Precis on Commerce and Communications in the Persian Gulf. 4626 F. D.f 10 and which * I beo- to suggest^ may be read in connection with this Report on account of the bearing of many of the remarks therein made on the subject of the proposed Electric Telegraph along the coast of Mekran. Syed Thoweynee pretends, of course ; that the Persian Government have no right to interfere with any concessions which he may please to make within the limits of his farm, and he would be doubtless highly gratified to find that the British Government were disposed to back his pretensions ; but with the Treaty before me, I do not see how we could enter into any definite arrangement with His Highness regarding the establishment of the Electric Telegraph between Bunder Abbas and Sudrej without obtaining the prior consent of the Shah of Persia, whose sovereign rights over that territory are specially reserved by the terms of the said Treaty. On the other hand, however, the distinct acknow ledgment by the British Government of the sovereignty of Persia over those districts (which would be necessarily involved in the application for any such concession from the Shah), might be very undesirable in a political point of view, and more especially so at the present time, when the Persians are actively engaged in aggressive movements on Mekran and towards Beluchistan. IS ot feeling competent to discuss this delicate question any further, I pass on to a description of the coast eastward of Sudrej. 4. The country from Sudrej to Jez, a distance of 150 miles, is within the jurisdiction of Meer Abdullah bin Moorad Mahomed, described as a powerful Beloochi Chief and an efficient ruler, preserving order and tranquillity among the tribes subject to his rule. He became tributary to Persia about twelve years ago, and still professes to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Shah ; but by all accounts Meer Abdullah would be glad of an opportunity to regain his independence. My Beloochi informants assured me that he was quite capable of protect ing a line of telegraph along the coast included within his jurisdiction, and they felt persuaded that he would willingly accede to any proposition from the British Government on the subject. But here also the same question arises, how far he could do so on his own authority consistently with his obligations to the Persian Government ? and again, how far it would be politic on our part, or fair towards this Chief, to seek any concession from the Shah in a territory which the Beloochi still regard as their own, though for the time wrongfully wrested from them by the Persians? Further, there is reasonable ground to fear that any such recognition by us of the sovereign rights of Persia over those districts would lead the Native Chiefs to do all in their power to frustrate the success of a scheme obtained, as they would judge, at the expense of their national independence. 5. Close to Jez is Charhar, a small town on the coast, subject to the 'Sultan of Muscat, whose jurisdiction extends over a wild rocky country to the vicinity of Gwettur. Charbar was taken by Syed Sultan, grandfather of the present ruler of Muscat, about a century ago, and has since remained in the undisputed possession of his successors. Unless interfered with by the aggressive designs of the Pemans, or of the Khan of Khelat, Syed Thoweyner would have no difficulty in securing a line of telegraph through this district. 6. The small town of Gwettur belongs to one Deen Mahomed, a petty independent Chief of a neighbouring tribe of the Zidgal; and from Gwettur to Jew nee the coast is subject to Lalla Midyan, a Beloochi Chief of the Sheikh Zada tribe, who resides at Jewnee and who is also described as being independent. The country here about is very barren, and the people miserably poor. A small subsidy to these ChieFs would doubtless suffice to engage them to protect the telegraph through their respective territories. 7. Next to Jewnee is the town of or Gwadel, owned by Syed Thoweynee of Muscat, and governed at present by his deputy, Seif bin Salem, of the Alo-boo Saeedy tribe of Arabs. The customs of the port are estimated at 4,000 dollars per annum, and are held at that rate by the Banyan, who farms all the Muscat Customs Dues. I perceive that Majcr Green suggests in his letter, dated 27th March, to the Political Superintendent, Upper Sind, that this place should be purchased by us from the Sultan of Muscat, and then made over to the Khan of Khelat, on the ground that the latter has valid claims to its possession, and has more than once intended to seize it; moreover, that its possession by Khelat would be advantageous to the Khan, and perhaps to ourselves also, as well in a political point of view, as more immediately in connection with the suggested line of Electric Telegraph along the coast of Mekran. 8. I have made careful enquiry into the statement whereon, it is said, the present Khan rests his claim to the town and port of Gwadel, namely, that it was merely lent to Syed Sultan, the Imaum of Muscat, about the middle of the last century, to enable him to quell an insurrection in some of his territories on the coast to the westward, after which it was to be restored to its owner ; but that the then K han dying, and the country falling into a state of anarchy, the successors of Syed Sultan had taken advantage of those circumstances to retain possession of Gwadel. The story is a plausible one, but I believe it to be wholly without foundation. I consider Syed Thoweynee^s plea that it was conquered by his grandfather, Syed Sultan, to be equally invalid. The most probable account of the manner in which Gwadel fell into the hands of Syed Sultan was given me by an old Beloochi Chief at Muscat, whose relatives have been in the service of the Imaum for several generations, and whose narrative of facts I found to correspond generally with the native chronicles of those times. He states that Syed Sultan, the fifth but the bravest son of Imaum Ahmed, the first of the * See paragraph 7 of this Precis below. V^CORDi Jcat dynasty, having rebelled against his father, repaired to the Khan of Khelat is aid in dethroning him. The Khan, wishing to have a friendly power Naval Force to protect his coast, and foreseeing that Sultan would eventually succeed to the Muscat sovereignty, so far volunteered his assistance as to give him in perpetuity the town and port of G wad el, the only attached condition being that he should always defend the place against the enemies of Khelat. Considering the unimportance of Gwadel at the time, and the Khan^s inability, from want of ships, to guard it from attack, there is no improbability in this story, and several of the facts on which it is founded are supported by contemporary Arabian histori ansJ ^Xt will doubtless be easy for the present Khan to dispute this statement, or to set aside the prescriptive right of undisputed possession by the successive rulers of Muscat for upwards . of a century; and he may further deem himself justified in establishing his claim by force but I am at a loss to perceive how such success would benefit him permanently, or prove of any advantage to the furtherance of the Telegraph scheme. Syed Thoweynee would certainly oppose any attempt of the kind, and although it is probable that he would be unable to resist a determined land attack by the Khau's Army, one of his ships of war would suffice to blockade the port and to cut off all communication with the sea, thereby stopping effectually all trade and doing serious •njury to the Khan's inland territories. 9. On the whole, therefore, it appears to me that the influence of our Agent at Khelat would be best used in dissuading the Khan from any such enterprise. His abstinence therefrom will prevent complications most detrimental to the growing trade of those ports ; will entail on himself no damage; and will leave him and us with a friendly ally at Gwadel, whose good offices may be relied on in any matter wherein British interests are concerned. I found that Syed Thoweynee was well aware of the attack which the Khan meditated against Gwadel in 1857, and he seemed to know, moreover, that the Chief had not relinquished the idea of seizing it; but the Khan is represented as hesitatiny to carry out his purpose, owing to the urgent expostulations of his kinsman, the Jam of Beyla, who is reported to have frequently dissuaded him from the undertaking, on the ground that it would be a violation of the promise made by his grandfather to Syed Sultan, i have been also assured that the Beloochees at Gwadel are quite satisfied with the Muscat rule, for Syed Thowyonee levies no tax on them ; and with a view of feeling rhemselves more safe from an attack by the Khan, they have urged His Highness to build a wall round the town, and he has promised to accede to the request as soon as possible, 10. The country between Gwadel and Punsinee, a distance of eighty miles, belongs to Khelat, and the general testimony of the Arabs and Beloochees, with whom i conversed on the subject at Muscat, agree in the opinion that, protected by the vigorous authority of the present Khan, the Electric Telegraph would he perffctly safe through that district. An eqnall}' favourable opini n was expressed regarding the feasibility of the scheme between Punsinee and Sonmeeanee. The intermediate line of coast belongs to the Jam of Beyla (or the Jam of the Zidga! as he is more usually stvled). a Chief who appears to be universally respected for his integrity and good government. He is said to be cousin to Khodadad Khan, the Khan of Khelat, acknowledging his suzerainty, but being in reality quite independent of him within his own territories. 11. I have deemed it superfluous to enter into any details of the countrv between Bunder Abbas and Bush ire. That tract being bond fide Persian Territory, and the coast being inhabited by a civilized population largely enyaHed in trade, no serious obstacles to the suecess- ful establishment of a line of telegraph can exist there should the Persian Government under take to protect it. I have also purposely omitted any suggestions regarding stations, for the simple reason that I anticipate no difficulty whatever on that score, but the i-election must be left to the officers who may be deputed hereafter to survey the route. All the-e points, how ever, are very secondary to the important political questions involved in this scheme. Persia is extending her conquests eastward, not far north of the projected line, and the Beloochee tribes, who once claimed the coast, are gradually losing their independence. Reliable intelligence reports her troops to be in force not far from Kej, and it is believed that they will eventually invade the territories of the Khan of Khelat. Apart from the more momentous considerations involved in the progress of Persian supremacy in Central Asia, and its bearing on our eastern policy, the actual conquests of the Persians on the line of the projected telegraph route cannot be overlooked in connection with that scheme. If we had to negotiate only with the Jam of Beyla, the Khan of Khelat, the Beloochee Chiefs on the coast, and with His Highness Syed Thoweynee of Muscat, I feel convinced that, with prudent management, the Electric Telegraph might be set up at once from Kurrachee to Bunder Abbas, and be maintained in perfect security. But in view of the .predominance lately acquired by Persia in those parts, can we safely set aside her claims to be consulted on the subject, safely, I mean, as regards the projected scheme ? Yet if any concession is asked of Persia as respects her lately acquired possession- in Mekran, shall we not thereby recognize a right which may be fraught with serious consequences hereafter, and thereby also give the Native Chiefs of those districts just cause to regard us as the allies of their hated invaders, instigating them by such a course to thwart the projected s heme in a thousand ways, which no Persian Force could effectually prevent ?

On tfye extreme west', under a Treaty between Maskat and the 'Persians, the Coast from Bunder Abbas to a point eastward of Cape Jask had been farmed to the former. Article IX of this Treaty specifies : 'Should the Governors of Pars, or the Governors of Kirman, on any important occasion wish to despatch troopfs towards Cutch or Mekran, or Beluchistan, they shall be treated with the respect due to Governors, and shall be supplied with provisions, guides and escorts/' 7.

The Persians had already reduced the Ameer of Bolaidi, whose territories extended about sixty miles along the coast, and placed the province of Geh under tribute. According to credible information collected at Maskat they bad also advanced from Bampur and occupied Sirbaz, completely routing the Beloochis. To the south they were reported to be in force as far as Nussirabad, having subjugated all the country to the west ward, and to be meditating an attack on Kej, the capital of the Khan of Khelat's Mekran territories ; while on the north they had very lately retaken the district of Dizzek from Azad Khan, a firm ally of the Dost, and were acting in concert with the Jam of Herat and Afzul Khan, w T ho were said to be march ing in force on Kandahar. The report communicated by Major Green respect ing this latter movement was contirmed at Maskat by several Beloochi Chiefs apparently well acquainted with the course of current events in Mekran and Baluchistan. 8. Whilst hesitating to attach any serious or immediate political conse quences, as regards British interests in the East, to these encroachments of Persia in Central Asia, Mr. Badger nevertheless deemed the subject of sufficient importance to evoke the vigilance of Her Majesty's Government. And as regards the proceedings of the same Power in the Persian Gulf, he thought that they supplied a strong motive for the adoption on our part of a vigorous yet discreet policy, such as may tend to conciliate the maritime Arab tribes in that quarter, and confirm them in their attachment to the British Government. * (ii) Proposed negotiation with Persia and local Chiefs. 9. The Bombay Government addressing the Government of India on the subject of probable negotiations for a line 0,9 0 l2th Juy 1861 ' of telegraph in these parts, expressed their opinion that it would he necessary to recognize what Persia actually possessed, and that the only sound course to pursue in this and all similar relations was, to deal direct with the Chiefs hy permission of the Sovereign Power. This course, while compromising the rights of neither party, wouid enable us to conciliate both. Persia would take no alarm at a proposal which would involve a recognition of her actual position, and the object of which would merely be that of facilitating the working out in detail of a scheme to which she had already given her consent: the Chiefs on the Court, on the other hand, would be satisfied with being, in practice, brought into direct communication with us, and thus fully assured of the various benefits which will naturally arise to them out of the establishment of the proposed Telegraph Line. His Excellency in Council, therefore, trusted that the Government of Jndia would procure from the Court of Persia, through the Minister at Tehran, the necessary permission for opening negotiations directly with the Chiefs. No. 5198 of 9th September 1861. lo. The Government of India replied: ' Had the sovereignty of Persia over the Mekran coast been throughout better established and more generally acknowledged, the Viceroy in Council would have felt less difficulty in concurring with the views entertained by His Excellency the Governor in Council. But the relations between Persia and the Chiefs of the Mekran coast are, even where based on Treaty conditions, as in the case of the Sultan of Muscat, of a dubious character. In others, as in * I have borrowed sections (ii) and (iv) —(viii) of Chapter II and Chapters IV, Y and VI mostly from Colonel Goldsiuid's Memorandum—Political A, June 1869, Nos. 357-358.13 the instance of Beloocli Chief, Meer Abdullah bin Morad Mahomed, the lately imposed yoke of Persia is borne with impatience and a sense of wrong. The Chiefs Din Mahomed of Gwettur and Lala Midyan of Jeoni are described as independent. The sovereignty of Gwadur is a smouldering matter of contest between the Khan of Khelat and the Sultan of Muscat, whilst assuredly both the Khan of Khelat and the Jam of Bela would feel aggrieved were the pretensions of their enemy (Persia) to receive countenance through any overtures made by the British Government to the Shah£ There is neither distinction nor certainty therefore in the relations between Persia and the Chiefs of this long tract of country. 'Under these circumstances, His Excellency the Governor-General in Council deems it unadvisable to request the Minister at Tehran to ask permission to negotiate with the Chiefs of the coast of Mekran, for such a course must expose our Minister to be called upon to explain what it is exactly that we request, and what points of the coast we consider as being under Persian sovereignty. The discussion would afford an opportunity, of which the Shah^s Government would certainly avail itself, for asserting claims which we are not in a condition either to admit or to deny, and any undue admission would, as Mr. Badger observes, be fraught with serious consequences. Influenced by these considerations, the 'Viceroy in Council does not deem it prudent, although hereafter there may arise reason sufficient for braving these difficulties, now to take the first step in a negotiation which is likely to be very embarrassing to ourselves, and perhaps injurious, some day, to the Chiefs whom we wish to conciliate and serve. ' The Governor General in Council has therefore preferred, as will be seen by the enclosed copy of the letter addressed to our Minister at Tehran, to abstain from making any request of the Persian Government, and has asked the British Ambassador, without making any overtures to ascertain how far along the coast Persia's claims to sovereignty extend, and what kind and degree of authority over the Chiefs the Shah exercises or asserts. a The Governor General in Council anticipates that Her Majesty's representative at the Court of Tehran may already be in possession of the views of the shah's Government, in consequence of the negotiations which passed between Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India and the Persian Ambassador in London, and that therefore our Minister may be in position to state the light in which the Shah's Government would view any bargain made b the British Government with the Chiefs, for the purpose of securing stations for the Telegraph and safety for the wire, in the event of the coast line being adopted by the Home Government. After these necessary preliminaries His Excellency will be prepared to consider the pro priety of applying to the Persian, Khelat, and Muscat authorities for an order on the part of each of these Governments addressed to their otlicers and subjects, without specification of names or locality, directing them to assist the officers of the British Government/' 11. The explanation of the Government of Bombay shows that there was No. 144 of 6th October 1861. no enter into hasty negotiations : ^ on the contrary, though they did not con sider it necessary to make an explicit statement of their impressions upon the subject, His Excellency in Council was under the belief that Persia had not yet established her dominion in any part of this very coast, although, accord ing to rumour, she was gradually extending her sway and bringing into subjection certain tribes who exercised a precarious authority along that section of it which is situated between the acknowledged territories of the Khan of Khelat on the one side, and those of the Imam of Maskat on the other. The Bombay Government had lately heard it rumoured that a Persian force was in possession of Pampur, from which the Belooch Chief had just retired on account of his inability to meet the Persian demands for revenue. It had also been lately surmised that an imaginary line drawn northwards from the port of Gwadur to Jalk would divide territories in which revenue w as collected to the west on behalf of Persia, and to the east on behalf of Khelat. Hence the Governor in Council considered that the only practical and prudent course would be to recognize the status which Persia actually possessed, for the British Government never yet intended Persia to recede from a position in her actual possession, and, therefore, more time might be lost in vainly seeking to induce her to withdraw from such possessions than would sufiice for completing all arrangements with her and other States and tribes, and for bringing British India into regular daily communication with Europe by the Electric Telegraph. The Governor in Council assumed that it would be advisable to deal directly with the Chiefs hy 'permission of the sovereign power, because, as a general rule, he is aware of no other effective and permanent mode of securing the co-operation and good-will of Chiefs wherever any sovereignty over them existed. 4626 F. D.u 12. ^he views entertained in Tehran at this particular period are set forth, by Mr. Alison to Earl Russell in his letter dated Tehran, 19th November 1861. Ferakh Khan had called upon him and dwelt much on the subject of the projected Telegraph through Persia. He expressed an anxious desire that it should be carried out. ****** Mr. Alison then took occasion to remark that it would have heen better had the conditions relative to the country bet ween Bunder Abbas and Sind been altogether left out ; for these miuht require consideration and involve a delay of some time, while, if the Telegraph was to be made, no time should be lost. Eerukh Khan thought that Persia ought not to be blamed for making some allusion to, and thus avoiding future misunderstanding respecting, a country which undoubtedly belonged to her, but over which she was not at present prepared to exercise a direct control. 13. The report of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the Captain Felix Jones, H. M.'s I. N., to Bombay negotiations then pending with the Government, No. 57, of 16th December 1861. Shah may be added in extenso :— ' Her Britannic Majesty's Minister in Persia having forwarded me, confidentially, a translation of a memorandum from the Persian Government to his address on the subject of the proposed line of Telegraph through Persia in India, I submit a copy of it for the information of His Excellency in Council, Bombay. ' It will be observed the Persian Government has accepted the conditions proposed by Her Majesty's Government, or at least made a parade of doing so under provisions which it seems to me can never be entertained. These provisions, in the second clause, imply proprie tary riorht, power, and authority by Persia over all Beluchistan proper, if not over the districts north of it, including Herat and Afganistan, and would bind Her Majesty's Government to the recognition of that right and authority. a In the third clause they exhibit a desire to extend or increase these implied prerogatives of the Persian Crown ad infinitum without opposition on our part, though the wording in this clause appears at variance with the terms ' without augmentation' in the previous clause. ' I make these hasty observations only en, passint. The true aim of the Persian Government will no doubt be more clearly apparent to His Excellency in Council than to myself. On my part it is only necessary to remark I put no faith whatever in the power or ability of Persia to protect a line of Electric Telegraph, even from Shiraz to Bunder Abbas, at the present time, and its energies are relaxing daily. I speak not only from my own experience and convictions, but the words of intelligent Persian officers of rank who hold or have held authority in the districts named.'' These are the clauses referred to by Captain Jones: IT. ' Also that the English Government shall engage that whatever power and authority and proprietary right the Persian Government from former times to the present day possessed from Bunder Abbas to the frontiers of Sind, shall remain in statu quo, without augmentation or diminution.■' , III. ' Also that whenever the Persian Government shall, from any cause whatever, desire to increase its power in those territories, the English Government shall, in no way whatever, either overtly or secretly, oppose the same.-' 14. The opinion of Her Majesty's Home Government is expressed in a _ _ ^ despatch from the Right Honourable the 22nd January 1862. sq '' to E ' Hammon(1 » E8q - Secretary of State for India: ' Sir Charles Wood is quite willing to agree to a stipulation that whatever claims the Persian Government may possess to the territory between Bunder Abbas and the frontier of Sind, shall not be affected by any arrangement for the construction of the Telegraph between those points, hut he must decline to enter into any prospective arrangement as to the protection of the line through that country.' 15. And Major Patrick Stewart, the Superintendent of the Telegraphs, before proceeding on a special mission to Persia, was instructed by the ^, . Government of India with reference to February 1862™ ' to P ' stewal,t ' 3rd Captain Jones's letter No. 57, of 16th December, to carefully abstain from making any statement, in word or writing, and from any course of action calcu lated to commit the British Government in any way whatever to a recognition or admission of the pretensions of Persia over Baluchistan and the districts north and west of it.15 16. In the following month the Government of India writes fully to the Secretary of State : No. 36 of 11th March 1862. ^ 'We have received a despatch from Her Majesty's Envoy at the Court of Persian containing copies of despatches addressed to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs upon the subject of the negotiations for the establishment of a line of Telegraph through Persia. ****** ' The second of these additional provisos is as follows ' That the English Government shall engage that whatever power, and authority, and proprietary right the Persian Govern ment, from former times to the present day, possessed and possesses, from Bundar Abbas to the frontier of Sind, shall remain in statu quo without augmentation or diminution.' ' To this stipulation, provided it be understood to mean that no such augmentation and diminution shall take place by any action or interference of the British Government, we see no objection. ' But if it is to mean that the British Government is to step in and protect the authority or right of Persia, between the limits named, in the event of that authority or right being threatened or attacked by a third party, the proviso would be a most imprudent one. We trust that Her Majesty's Government will not make any engagement that can be so interpreted ; or that can be held as giving sanction to indefinite pretensions on the part of Persia whenever it may suit the Government of that country to seek to extend its frontiers eastward. ' The third proviso begins as follows:—'That whenever the Persian Government shall, from any cause whatever, desire to increase its power in those territories, the English Govern ment shall, in no way whatever, either overtly or secretly, oppose the same.' «These words are objectionable. They are not in accordance with the spirit of our engagement with Dost Mahomed. They are inconsistent with the support and friendship which we extend to the Khan of Kelat: and they would probably render hopeless the success of the negotiations which we shall have to enter into with the petty Chiefs between the actually existing boundary of the authority of Persia and the frontiers of Sind. We could not expect those Chiefs to look without suspicion at such an engagement between our Gov ernment and that of the Shah, although it does not in terms prevent us from observing neutrality between themselves and Persia. ' We trust, therefore, that Her Majesty's Government will not assent to this third proviso in regard to which Ferukh Khan has admitted that it is very unlikely that action should ever have to be taken upon it; and we recommend that the second proviso be not accepted unless the words ( so far as any interference by the British Government is concerned,' or words to that effect, be added to it. il Whatever addition is made to this second proviso the object should be to avoid com mitting the British Government to anything that can be construed into an admission of the soundness of the pretensions of Persia. (This will appear the more necessary when it is observed that in the fourth proviso the Persian Government designates the countries between the Persian and Sind Frontiers ' those, its territories,' thus incidentally asserting its claim to sovereignty over all the countries between the existing frontier posts of Persia, and those of the British Government in Sind.) We are of opinion that the British Government should not commit itself to any such admission as is implied from the above words quoted from the fourth proviso. &lt;&lt; From these remarks it will be seen that in our opinion the Persian Government, in these additional provisos, aims by the second to commit the British Government to sweeping admissions in favour of the pretensions of Persia over countries which have long shaken off a voke which was never more than very temporarily established, if it can be considered ever to have been really established at all. By the third proviso the Persian Government, taking advantage of the admissions prescribed in the second proviso, would paralyze all opposition on the part of the British Government to any attempts that the Shah may make to advance his frontier to the Indus. Whilst in the fourth proviso words are used which distinctly ^ claim all the expanse of territory between the frontiers of Sind and Persia as the Shah's dominions. As we think it probable that Her Majesty's tiovernment will decline to accede to these pro visos and therefore that no satisfactory arrangements with the Persian Government may be concluded, we have decided on recommending a careful examination of an alternative line from any point in the Turkish territory on the Euphrates, along the Arabian Coast, by the southern shore of the Persian Gulf, to a point opposite to, and clear of the Persian frontier, and thence by Submarine Cable to Gwadur or Kurrachee.' 17. The correspondence between the Governments of India and Bombay Paragraph No. 32. dated 24th April 1862, above noted resulted in the appointment from the Government of Bombay, to the Secre- 01 £t mission to survey and report upon tary of state. the coast of Mekran, with a view to the establishment of a land line of Telegraph. A full Report of this Mission was placed before Government. Arrangements were concluded with the Khan of16 Khelat, the Jam of Beyla and the Chiefs of Kej and Pasni ( vide Aitchison's Treatise, Volume IX, pages 394, 395, 401-401). 17A. The line from Karachi to Gwadur was completed on 30th April ''(Political A, August 1863, Nos. 63-67. jL 863 ( S ? e P^graph 13 of report of Commissioner m Smd,* No. 70, dated 4th June 1863). (iii) Proposed lease or purchase of Gwadur, 1863. 17B. In April 1863 Mr. S. Mansfield, Commissioner in Sind, proceeded on p ,. t . , \ n n k .ncco tvt a* o* ^ tour ^ound the Persian Gulf, and while Political A—G. G., August 1863, Nos. 63-67. ^ tit i j* i n ~ at Maskat discussed with the Sultan a proposal either to purchase or obtain a lease of Gwadur. He found the Sultan strongly indisposed to sell the place, but prepared to give a lease of the promontory and town of Gwadur for a term of ten years, subject to a re newal from time to time on the same terms, on an annual rental of 12,000 dollars, which was considered an exorbitant sum, considering the then actual revenue, which could not be more than 5,000 dollars a year. Mr. Mansfield, however, advocated strongly the advisability of obtaining a lease of the place on a reasonable annual rental. 17C. The Bombay Government were opposed to this proposal and though^ that only such portion of land as was actually required for the purpose &amp; of telegraph should be rented. The Government of India agreed with the Bombay Government 'as to the manifold disadvantages attending such a measure, not the least of which would be the suspicion that would give rise that the 'lease was only a pretext for covering an appropriation of territory '. The Govern ment of India also wished that the Imam might be informed that the British Government would be quite content with the lease of ground sufficient for accommodation of the telegraph offices and quarters, etc., so as to avoid any appearance of weakening the Sultan's authority at Gwadur or of desirin ^ to occupy any part of his possessions even to the small extent proposed ( No. 484 dated 8th August 1863). It may be noted here that the telegraph station at Gwadur was abolished in 1893 and the cable joined direct from Manora to Jask. (iy) Obstruction of the Persian Governor Ibrahim Khan of Bampur to the progress of the telegraph line to Gwadur—claims of Persia to Gwadur and the rest of Mekran.^ 18. From the Sind frontier, at the Hubb River, to Gwadur, the country Government Resolution, 28th December 1861. ^JS clearly Under the Sovereignty of Secretary to the Government of India, to the -Khelat, Gwadur itself Was a DOSqpstnnn &amp;1sal Bombay - No ' 10M » f ^ of tte Sultan of Maskat WesS o? t Gwadur it was not thought advisable under the circumstances, to proceed; at all events until further diplomatic action had been taken. l 19. But there had been a threatening of political difficulties from the Ibrahim' k L w ^ constru ? tio11 o f tlie ^raph line to Owadur. Ibrahim khan of Bampur, the executive officer of the Kerman Government and representative of all Persian interests in Baluchistan, came forward to exercise interference on behalf of his masters. Three letters addressed bv him at this period to the Sultan of Maskat, the Khan of Khelat, and the Wali of Gwadur, respectively, are significant. Accompaniment to letter No. 41, of 9th April ') Gov—„f^ 0 .r i ' Si0ner in Sind ' 10 j To the Sultan he wrote: ' Plying mmonrs wwe coDstant'y reaching to the effect that the English TVIe-mnVnV r ? ^ !

My intention was, in the event of parties being desirous of transportinir their things from ship to shore, to prevent them all from doing so until they had brought an authority from the Persian Government, on production of which, if they desired to extend the wire across my face, they would be at liberty to do so. My dear brother, Meer Abdullah Khan, however, forbade me to place my foot in the house of you, my brother, without your knowledge. Although it is Mekran soil that is concerned, and although Bunder Abbas and Charbar are entrusted to you, my brother, on the part of Persia, yet it was necessary I should make * ^ &lt; an intimation to you on the subject. I am at * Stc tn or\g. : but Pishm in the Persian. p llssnee . territory protected by Persia and ia stages distant from Gwadur ; I beg to notify to you, my brother, that if you are able to repel those English and not permit them to transport their things from sea to shore, very good; otherwise 1 am here with your knowledge and permission, and if it is not in your power to prevent them, write me word that I may come and prevent them with a view to their proceeding and obtaining an authority from the Persian Government. This much I write to you; that I cannot as a servant to Persia look back upon such proceedings lightly, and it is requisite that I should come and take up my position there and prevent them. If more troops be required, 1 must write to the Belerbey of Pars and Kerman to send more, in which event your territories and the territories entrusted to me will be ruined/' 20. In connection with these written threats Mr. Walton, Superintendent, Mekran Telegraph Department, wrote to the Commissioner in Sind (No. 109, dated 18th April 1863) that during the early part of the month he remained at Gwadur receiving material and stores and arranging for the completion of the line. Constant rumours of the approach of a large body of Rinds, under Persian Commanders, kept the place in a state of excitement, and all communication with the interior was interrupted. On the morning of the 12th of March a body of these marauders, commanded by Shah Dost, under the orders of the Persian Governor of Bampur, approached within three or four miles of Gwadur, carrying off a great number of camels and cattle of all sorts. The reported murder by them of twelve men had been confirmed, and several wounded were brought into Gwadur. Except that this affair caused alarm among the work men, no direct injury was sustained by the telegraph construction parties. The country had been otherwise undisturbed, and he continued to anticipate that both the working parties and the line would remain uninjured. 21. A few days after completion of the line two more letters from Ibrahim Major Merewether to Secretary to Government Khan, One to the Wali of Gwadur and of Bombay, 15th May 1863. Page 361, Volume OUC to Mr. Walton, WCre received through 112 of 1863. Political Agent at Maskat. The writer, as expressed in the forwarding letter, seemed c&lt; to confine his threats to the carrying of the Telegraph beyond Gwadur; but at the same time speaking of Mekran and Beluchistan in most vague terms.' 22. Ibrahim Khan's proceedings having formed the subject of a reference to Tehran, Mr. Thomson, Secretary of Legation and then Charge d'Affaires, informed the Political Agent at Maskat on the 6th May 1863 that the Gov ernor of JBampur had no authority either from this Government or from his immediate superior, the Governor of Kerman, to take the steps which he did. q « i v.i no * 1c « q Indeed, the Shah's Ministers were in igno- xa£6 361j v olume 112 01 1863* pijij jii # ranee of what bad occurred ; having as yet received no reports from the frontier officials relative to this matter. The Persian Government did not disapprove of Ibrahim Khan's having intimated that if the Telegraph was to pass through any districts which were the property of Persia, the permission of the Persian Government would be required, but they disapproved of the communications which bethought proper to make on this occasion. Be was, however, as far as might be justly surmised from the style of his correspondence, a person of inferior rank and standing, and, as the Amin-ud-Dowlah remarked, scarcely competent to arrive at very sound conclusions on matters connected with the foreign relations of the country. At the same time the Persian Ministers stated that not only Bunder Abbas, but also some of the districts in Mekran and on the shores of the Persian Gulf, belonged to Persia, though they were for the present, either by 4626 p. y.18 lease or by some other understanding between the two parties, in the possession of the Imam of Maskat, and that, therefore, if the Telegraph was to pass through those districts, or through any portion of the territory actually in the posses sion of Persia, an arrangement would be made between the English and Persian Governments for its construction. But the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Mr. Alison that the object of the Persian Government in advancing this pretension was simply that any claims which they might possess to territory in those tracts should not be affected by the construction of the present line of Telegraph, without their sanction having previously been obtained; and His Excellency assured me that Ibrahim Khan of Bampur would be ordered not to interfere in this matter without special instructions from the Persian Ministers. Mr. Alison stated that it had not been found necessary to act upon the authority granted by the Imam of Maskat to land English troops for the protec tion of parties engaged in constructing the Telegraph ; as he believed that the fact of British troops, even in small number, being landed on the coast near the Persian frontier and perhaps in places to which the Persian Government pre tend to have some sort of claim would produce an unfavourable impression at this Court, where the circumstance would be represented in the exaggerated form usual to Persians, and the consequences of such a measure being ^adopted might therefore prove to be embarrassing as regards future arrangements respecting our Telegraph communications in this quarter. 23. After communicating these occurrences to the Foreign Office, Mr. Thomson transmitted translation of two letters which he had received from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, together with his reply. The Page 369 of Volume 112 of 1863. Minister said that the Persian Govern- „ . 1 . ment, though they considered Gwadur and Char bar to be their own property, and that therefore with regard to the Indian Telegraph the English officers should have entered into an arrangement with Persia for its construction, still as they were desirous to show their friend ship and to co-operate with the English, they would not object to issue instruc tions to their Governors and Agents in Kerman and Baluchistan to assist in facilitating the construction of the Telegraph from Karachi and its extension from Gwadur to Charbar; so that those engaged in this work might not be troubled with any obstacles which otherwise those Persian Agents might have been 3ustified in imposing. But in return for this co-operation it was incum bent upon the English Government to give to the Persian Ministers an assurance that the fact of the Telegraph passing through those districts would ^ S ? n y wh lc h Persia may possess to those places. It was clear that the English Government would not allow this Telegraph, which ought to prove beneficial to both Governments and of special advantage to the Enolish Government, to become the cause of weakening the territorial rights • jTuTi ^emment-because, otherwise, if the Persian Ministers perceived that by the construction of this line their rights would be impaired, they would be obliged to pause and hold out upon the general question of the Telegraph. But as the only object on both sides was to show inendship to each other, they felt assured that the English Government would re*assure them on this point, and that the Telegraph line, which must tend to Page 373, Volume 112 of 1863. cement the friendly feeling subsisting completed between the two Governments, would be 24. Copies of the above correspondence were sent by Mr. Thomson to the Bombay Government, and it was pointed out to him in reply (letter Page 385, Voi»*ie 112 of 1863. ^ 14, dated 15th July 18fi3) that ^ _ f^m Gwadur eastwards the Persian Government had not for generations past professed or exercised any rights whatever r that the line was not to be extended westward of Gwadur by land and that nothing whatever has been done by the parties in charge of the lelegraph works between Karachi and Gwadur to give the slightest iustifica- toon torthe unfriendly and unauthorized proceedings of the Persian authorities/ 19 25. On the 15th October 1863 Mr. Alison enclosed, for Lord Russell's Page 631 of Voiame 112 of 1863. informcitionj another letter from the , a ^ , Persian Minister asking for information whether the Sultan of Maskat was about to lease the ports of Gwadur and Charbar to the British Government; and denying his right to perform any sucn act ' because there can be no question that these places form a part of the Mekran territory be ongmg to Kerrnan, and are clearly and absolutely the property of the Persian Government. Though for a time they had been in the hands of the Imam of Maskat in the same manner that Bunder Abbas, the Islands of Kishm and Hormuz, the districts of Issitaiian. bhemil and Mmab, and the Port of Khamir have all been held temporarily by him from the Persian Government, there can be no reason to justify the Imam of Maskat in adopting such measures with respect to Persian territory. This proceeding 1 on his part, should it have been accomplished, will cause the Persian Ministers to feel great dissatisfaction with the imam ot Maskat, and will oblige them to weigh in their minds the nature of the relations which at present exist between them and His Highness, with a view to some other measure being adopted in respect to this state of affairs.' It was distinctly agreed with the Imam of Maskat that, in regard to the territories entrusted to him, no foreigners were to obtain a footing therein, but the above proceeding is wholly at variance with that engagement.' 26. At the close of the year 1863 instructions were issued by the Govern- From Secretary to Gov0rnment f to Liputeoant* , ment ° f to the officer, who bad Colonel Goidumid, No. 3986, of nth Deceiuber been deputed to make the preliminary '^Volume 101 of 1863, page 109. Telegraph arrangements between Ear- achi and Gwadur, to peruse the pro ceedings on record in the Secretariat, and prepare a detailed statement for communication to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran through the Secretary of State for India, showing, according to the best information available, how far the claims of Persia, Kelat, or Maskat, or any other State to any sovereign right in any town or district in Mekran are founded on Treaty or possession or acknowledgment by the local rulers. (v) Colonel Goldsmid's Report of December 1863 in regard to Persian claims in Mekran, Dated 19th December 1863. 27. The following paragraphs of a Volume 101 of 1863, page 139. Report by Colonel Goldsmid resulting from these instructions are given chiefly in extemo :— ' As to her right, I know of none but of the strong over the weak; of the prestige of a high sounding monarchy over the obscurity of a small Chiefdom. More than one hundred years ago Nadir Shah appointed Nussir Khan Brahui the Beylerbey, or Governor of the whole of Baluchistan, inclusive of Mekran, and in such capacity he was no doubt to some extent a feudatory of Persia, but it is also more than one hundred years ago that he exchanged the ^a«-service of the Shah for that of the Afghan King. His allegiance to Candahar was no less binding than to Persia. It was the allegiance exacted by a stronger arm than his own. When the Afghan monarchy fell to pieces, the service ceased; but Baluchistan also fell to pieces, and its Chiefs set up claims of independence for themselves. Then came the opportunity for Persia to regain what she had lost. She had, however, in this case, no great prize to recover, and could allow her Governor of Kerman, or a subordinate at Bampur, to proceed leisurely in the work of oppression, and set forth, as occasion served, absolute claims. Of late years she has, perhaps, been more than usually active in this re-assertion of Mekran sovereignty. The present state of affairs in Kelat must be specially favourable to her views. Anarchy in that quarter cannot but afford occasion for intrigue, if not for the actual advance of troops. But no new argument will be needed to show that anything like the dismemberment of Kelat would be as advantageous to Persian interests as detrimental to our own. ' If possession for a period of years must necessarily imply ' acknowledgment by the local rulers/ it is the acknowledgment of helplessness. I do not for a moment believe that the Persian yoke is acceptable to the Sirdars of Mekran west of Kelat. A petition was presented to me when at Gwadur in February last year, from one of the neighbouring Chiefs, and others had been forwarded to the Commissioner at Karachi before my departure from that place, praying generally for British interference against the tyranny of the ' Gujjurs' collecting the revenue. None of these could be noticed at the time, and that addressed to myself was, if I rightly remember, returned to the bearer unread, so soon as its purport was a scertained. ' And yet, if we acknowledge the right of prior conquest, in the wide sense of the^ word, whether for Nadir Shah on behalf of Persia, Ahmed Shah of Candahar, or Nussir Khan of Baluchistan, it is not clear how exception can be taken to any description of past territorial |20 aggression and encroachment by the same, or any of the same powers involving no stronger claim upon our interference than direct and open warfare. Moreover, the results with which we have to do are those of a state of things in which we could not legitimately have exercised interference at any time. At the present moment the case is different. Kelat is our close ally Though not bound by existing Treaty to protect her frontier by force, we have treated with her a? an independent State, ( to protect our Telegraph up to a certain pomt withm her limits and there is now a legitimate opening for taking exception at any unauthorized aggression from without, upon such boundary line. Our case, it is deferentially submitted, wants but a ratified agreement between the powers concerned, to make remonstrance not only jegal but compulsory. ' In an interesting paper on Kelat affairs, prepared by the son of the late Darogha Gul Mahomed, and translated by Captain Dickinson about two years ago, I find it mentioned that a special Envoy from the Shah of Persia had come to Nussir Khan of Kelat to settle a question of the western boundary of that province. It was then represented that Persia had no claims to Kej and Mekran, but to Minab, which having been captured by the Khan would have to be abandoned. The boundary was then defined to be from Kej to ( hedar on the sea coast. It is also asserted that there is a well at Chedar Malik with the inscription recording the limits. From other evidence on this point, I fear that the inscription, if found at all, will only mark the boundary of Mekran, without reference to the rights of this or that Sovereign. At the same time it is just possible there may be some record on the subject in the Kelat Dufter. Of treaties I am not sanguine that any exist, nor do I feel warranted in delaying this report to communicate with those officers who are either already acquainted, or could readily become acquainted with the subject. ' Though not called upon to pass any opinions on the disposal of the Mekran boundary question, I 'would most respectfully submit to the notice of His Excellency the Governor in Council that the occurrences of the two last * Durbars were held in my tent, th« most years have greatly strengthened the arguments fervent assurances of assistance to the Telegraph U ged in paragraphs 101 and 102 of my printed officers were made, and all that occurred to me x&gt; 0 ^ i J nT ; Tfm ± p f rOTn Kararhi to as wanting to spcure a satisfactory arrangement Repot , , 0 , ^ , i vftO . * ' 1 + was a well-defined western boundary of the Gwadur, dated 22nd February loti-i; and not Kelat State, such as now acknowledged to be the least forcibe of all the arguments adducible under the independent control of His Highness j n pressing this point would be the expressed Western^Mekran ^ ^ bouI1( * ary ' * n ^ ict ' of wish of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs This boundary, so far as the qnestion has on discussing the Heiat question.

World, becomes full of life and meaning when viewed from Western India. ' Government have done me the honour to put to me a question of great importance. I have not the data to make a satisfactory reply, nor do I feel authorized to make, and await the references which alone could enable me to do so. Mahomed Ali and Din Mahomed of Baho, Abdul Rahman of Jeoni, Mir Abdullah of Geh, and others have yet to tell their tale. The first two, it may be noted, are Judgals of the same Semma family as the Jam of Bela, our immediate neighbour. My humble opinion on the subject, with the data available, may be briefly summarized in the following paragraph ' 'Persia has, of late years, encroached upon territory of which, though her sovereign rights are questionable, her claim to possession is fully equal to that of any Government stronger than that of the petty Chiefs themselves whom she subjugates. Any interference from without to stop her career, if admissible under the laws and lawful practice of nations, should have been exercised long since; but she has now reached a point vital, as it were, to British India, and should be checked at the first good opportunity. Necessity for protecting our Telegraphs; Persia's own wish expressed to our Minister at her Court for adjustment of boundary ; the acknowledgment of Kelat as an independent State allied to England, all these circumstances show that the present time is most opportune to decide on a line of boundary for Western Mekran. The Dusht Khor seems to offer an appropriate starting point from the sea side. From hence a line might be run towards Seistan, eastward of which Persia's interference might be held infraction of Treaty. A line of road within the Kelat territory opening out the Herat trade with Gwadur, a port in the same longitude as Herat, should, I submit, be a consideration for Boundary Commissioners on the part of Great Britain. As to Kelat, her claim to any portion of Western Mekran, hitherto unaffected by late Persian aggression, is based, as ageneral rule, on right 1 .t yet annulled by later events. And finally tlie question of Gwadur is 1 id Kelat only, with which Persia has no concern, and in which Goverd ecorded an opinion though not declared to be decisive/ ' 'On the subject of the claims of the Imam of Miiskat, the only two possessions that seem to require notice are Gwadur and Choubar or Charbar. Those further to the west commence from the point where the Mekran boundary (or at all events the Eelooch Mekran boundary) terminates. It is presumed that the tract between this boundary and Persia proper must be considered to be Persian Baluchistan, if not Eastern Kerman. ' Of the history of Gwadur little is known prior to its first possession by Sultan Syed of Maskat about the middle of the last century. From Albuquerque''s Commentaries we learn that one of the conditions which the Ambassador of the Shah of Persia exacted from the Portuguese in the Treaty made at Ormuz in about 1515 was that they should give their aid in retaking Gwadur from a rebellious King of Mekran. The position of Gwadur is described to be between Cape Jash and Sind, and it is called subject to the King of Ormuz. Albuquerque gave the required aid. The name is also contained in several maps, and casually inserted in several Gazetteers, both old and recent, but I have been unable to obtain anything like a detailed Memoir. ' Major Green was of opinion that it was a mere temporary possession of the Imam, lent for a special occasion which no longer existed, and that it rightly belonged to Kelat. This is the view also stated by the son of the Darogha Gul Mahomed in his Memoir of Kelat, translated by Captain Dickinson. The Revd. Mr. Badger thought it was a gift in perpetuum from a former Sultan to a former Khan. The only evidence that I have been enabled to discover, in addition to that' obtainable in the records of Government, is that of Haji Abdul Nubbi, published in the Asiatic Society's Journal under the heading of Tour through parts of Baluchistan in 1838 and 1839. He says : 'the Brahui's half of Gwadur was given in grant by Mir Nussir Khan to the present Imam's father Syed Sultan, who took refuge at Kelat during some convulsion of the State/ Upon the whole, even setting aside prescriptive right and present possession, 1 think the Imam's claim a fair one. Viewed as a possession of a 100 years, it seems quite indisputable. 'Ghouhar, Mr. Badger states, was taken by Syed Sultan, grandfather of the present Ruler. ' about a century ago, and has since remained in his possession/ With the limited experience which I possess on Maskat and Persian Gulf affairs, compared to this gentleman, I could not venture to argue upon other premises than these. And viewed in this light there can be no cause to dispute the sovereignty of the Imam, acquired by right of conquest. Whether there be any subsequent terms or Treaties modifying the title, I cannot, however, pretend to say. Judging from the great stress laid by the Persian Government upon the non-extension of our Telegraph westward of Choubar without the authority of the Shah, I should think it more than probable that Choubar does belong exclusively to the Imam.' 27.

D, M 21 )t yet annulled by later events. And finally the tid Kelat only, with which Persia has no concern, •ecorded an opinion though not declared to be22 and not to the town itself, which was a free gift, with the other half revenue. In this view, our right to raise the question of revival of claim on behalf of Kelat would not ; it is presumed, be recognized by Government, or contemplated for a moment. (f The Bolaidis are members of a Beluch tribe which was, in those days, of great influence. Their Chief was Nur Mahomed, and he held the greater part of Lower Mekran, inclusive of Basvu Dustyari. I take this tract to represent the Government of Sirbar, once of considerable local repute, called from a town or village of that name situated almost midway between Bampur and Kedje. Nur Mahomed was succeeded by his son, Mir Dostin, whose name is well remembered in Mekrani annals. Among his vassals, or confidential servants, was one Soban, afterwards known as Mir Soban, who, under Nowabj the brother and successor of Dostin, was strong enough to wrest for himself, out of the hands of the Bolaidis, the Government of Hawu Dustyari. In the struggle Nowab was slain. Comparing this account with that of the late Lieutenant Grant, Mir Soban would seem to be one oftheJedgals invited by Dostin from Bela to assist him in resisting aggression from Kedje. This view at once explains the location of Sindis so far to the westward : for the Jedgal (Jett gal ?) is a term used in Baluchistan to distinguish the Sindi from the Beluch, and not the mere name of a tribe or clan. The period of Mir Soban''s rule is unmistakably marked in the above lamented officers diary. On the 30th January 1809 he arrives at' Gwettur, village of Mir Soban .' On the 1st February following he is at Nagor. 4 Mir Soban lives here : territory from Jeoni to Choubar, and about 40 miles inland, called Bawu Dustyari, from two largest villages. Jedgal, 300 cavalry, 3,000 infantry, with sword and matchlock : revenue about rupees 6,000, tribe of great weight / ' In paragraph 18 of my Report of the 19th ultimo I suppose Mr. Badger's version of the Choubar tenure the correct one. The further details now obtained on this subject strengthen the supposition. About 60 years ago Shuffi Mahomed Bolaidi was Governor of Choubar. Mir Soban, then in the plenitude of his power, was in receipt of a fourth of the revenues. Allah Rukkhia Khwoja proposed to the Imam Syed Sultan to annex Choubar to Maskat. The Imam ma le the proposition to Shuffi Mahomed, who compromised the matter by giving him a quarter of the revenue. This arrangement lasted for ten years, when the place fell wholly into the hands of Syed Sultan. It was captured by surprise during the night at the invitation and through the intrigues of the aforesaid Allah Rukkhia, an enemy of Soban. ShuSi Mahomed afterwards returned accompanied by Mahomed Khan, assaulted Choubar with the intention of destroying the Mehman inhabitants, and so far succeeded that he slew Allah Rukkhia. This account would show the capture of Choubar to have been effected only half a century ago, whereas Mr. Badger shows it to have been about a century ago. It must, at all events, have occurred before 1809, for Lieutenant Grant's Journal, written in the early part of that year, states that, at Choubar the ' duties amount to rupees 5,000, formally divided between the Syed of Maskat and Mekran Chiefs. The former has seized, and keeps the whole. ' At Maskat there could be no difficulty in finding the exact date. ' With your letter of the 29th ultimo I was favoured with a copy of Mr. Alison's letter to Lord Russell, No. 15, of the 15th October 1863. It supplies the information alluded to in my P, S. of the 22nd ultimo, and though not in any way modifying the opinion deferentially submitted in paragraph 20 of my Report of the 19th idem, it certainly proves the necessity of immediate enquiry with regard to Gwadur. But Choubar is equally dwelt upon in the Persian Minister's letter of the 10th October last, the ' two Ports ' being the places referred to in the marginal extract. I shall therefore make investigation into the title of these, a matter of paramount importance. 'In 1810, when Lieutenant Pottinger was travelling in Baluchistan, it is quite clear that ir i on ^ Persia had no acknowledged footing so far oume 0 5 P a P e • eastward as Mekran, even supposing the Western District of Bampur to be within the limts of that State. The revolution which gave to Nussir Khan Brahui freedom from the Shah's control was succeeded, at his death in 1795,* by another which set aside individual supremacy, but admitted a number of petty Chiefdoms, the stronger to prey upon the weaker. Doubtless most, perhaps all, of these had prior existence as tributary or subordinate Governments. It was only when Nussir Khan had ceased to exercise the controlling power that they asserted claims to independence. I have already alluded to Pottinger's division of Mekran. This was strictly geographical, and may be open to amendment. I wish it were now in my power to furnish a complete division, political as well as geographical. One thing is tolerably certain; excepting the two ports belonging to Maskat, the whole line of coast westward of Gwadur up to Chedar, the boundary of Mekran, is under no Chief of any pretensions, but the Chiefs of Geh and Baho Dustyari. On these two Governments I have collected some scraps of information, which are in my opinion trustworthy ; and if not so piece by piece, at least in affording a generally correct outline o narrative. But it will be well to revert to Bampur and its status since 1810. ' In that year not only was the Shah's authority disavowed in Bampur which, it should always be borne in mind, if Mekran at all is the most westerly, that is, the district nearest to * Masson differs from Pottinger, and makes Mohbut Khan the nominee of Nadir Shah in Beluchistan, and Nussir Khan his successor under Ahmed Shah of Afghanistan. This position is not improbable if Nussir Khan reigned 40 years as st r ^ed. For Nadir Shah died in 1747, and Nussir Khan 48 years later, in 1795. This would modify the detail of, without altering the conclusions drawn from, Keport of the 19th ultimo.23 Persia of that province ; but we are told of the existence of a feeling there decidedly hostile to Persian influence. Pottinger describes Shah Mihrab Khan, the Governor, c the most powerful Chief in this quarter ; bis regular troops, or at least those that be can muster at a few days' notice, are 6,000, and he is acknowledged to be the paramount authority from Dizzuk to Bu s man * * * His tribe is that branch of the Nharuis, called Urbabis, who are stated to have been of no note whatever, and had dwelt in obscurity in a sterile and elevated tract near Surhud whence the progenitors of the present Khan emigrated with a body of followers to Dizzuk, in which district they acquired a footing by donation of soil from the Mekran Chiefs. ,} Again, * the original masters of the villages of Puhra, Haftur, Maghsi, and the intermediate country were the Malikah Beluchis, who have been nearly exterminatsd during their struggles and contentions with the Urbabi ; and those few that have escaped from the sword of their enemies fled to Nurmanshir, where the Persian Government allotted them a territory, and affords them protection JSurmanshir is Persian soil and may belong to Kerman. In talking to Lieuten ant Pottinger, Mihrab Khan mentions the Persians in terms of little measured abuse, wonder ing why the F'eringhi did not exterminate them ? To conclude, however, with a quotation t History of Baluchistan, Chapter XII, pages more apt than any other ^ that can be found :t 173-174. I was desirous of ascertaining the terms on which the Persians and Beluchis stood with each other, and I enquired if the intercourse was frequent between him and the Government of Kerman * * &lt; Intercourse / rejoined he, laughing, ' No ! we have had none for these last two years, nor is it likely to be again renewed. A few months anterior to that period. Shah Mihrab Khan, Qaem Khan, and myself sent our collec tive armies on a chapao into Laristan, and laid waste that province * * * The conse quence was that there were no revenues forthcoming, and the Hakim of Minab was called to Kerman, to be made answerable for the defalcation ; but when he represented the true state ment of the business to the Shahzadeh, he was released from confinement, and two messengers were forthwith despatched with^threatening firmans to us. * * . Who transmitted these letters to the Prince, setting him and his threats at defiance/ « Such being the state of affairs in the extreme west, it is but natural to infer that at this period the more easterly parts of Baluchistan, as the more remote from the Shah's influence, were wholly independent of Persia from 1810 to 1843. 1 have now no data before me, but have no reason t'&gt; believe that the pretensions of Persia were practically put forward until about the year of the conquest of Sind. For the following brief narrative of certain occur rences in 1843-44, I am indebted to Sett Nao Mull, of Karachi, who vouches for its accuracy. ' In May 1843, or three months after the Battle of Meanee, His Highness Agha Khan MeWati came to Karachi from Jeruk, accompanied by his brother Sirdar Khan. At the close of the year he gave an entertainment in his garden, inviting the British residents. It was then bruited, and a matter of common talk, that Sirdar Khan was on the eve of setting out on an expedition to Mekran ; and such proved to be the case. Some two hundred horsemen were got together, attended by whom he left Karachi. In a few weeks they reached Gwadur, where they made a short halt. From thence they advanced to Charbar, which was found a convenient spot for remaining in, owing to the number of Khowjas residing there, who pay tribute to the A gha. At Charbar communication was opened, and systematically kept up with the inland town of Bampur. Sirdar Khan made friends and partizans of the Beluchis in the vicinity, besides gettmg a footing for his own immediate followers, and eventually suc ceeded in obtaining possession of the place from the hands of the independent Beluch Chief. In these head-quarters he applied himself to collect a force, and may have succeeded in drawing together some 2,000 men. The history of this remarkable family will sufficiently explain to^the satisfaction of Government why a movement of the kind should prove offensive to Persia, whatever might have been the ultimate objects of Sirdar Khan, and even supposing he intended to restrict his advance westward to Bampur; and on the report of occupation of this town by the party from Sind, made to his Government by the Governor of^ Kerman, it is not surprising that a royal mandate was issued for its investment. It was besieged, and in course of time reduced. Sirdar Khan was taken prisoner and sent t® Tehran. From this period the Persian hold of Bampur has been more or less maintained. Some three or four years later the employes of Persia moved still further to the eastward, encroaching upon the Beluch Chiefdoms of Geh and Kussurkund. ****** ■v . ' It is well worthy of remark that Mr. Badger, speaking of Mir Abdullah of Geh, , Letter to the Acting Secretary to Government, mentions that he ' k ec ame tributary to Persia Bombay, No. 9, of 3rd June 1861. about 12 years ago (1849), and still fprofesses Yide paragraph 5 of this precis. (1861) to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Shah/ This assertion, not given as mere hearsay, but the result of careful inquiry, agrees well with that of Nao Mull, who makes the capture of Bampur by the Persians to have been in about 1845, and the subsequent invasion of Geh and Kussurkund some few years later, or in about 1849. « My Karachi informants relate that, when the Persians first levied tribute in Geh and Kussurkund, they took Mir Abdullah prisoner, and carried him off to Kerman. He was detained for a year in captivity, and ransomed for 1,000 sitaramis (£550). Din Mahomed24 was then in Baho, and collected the required amount. On Mir Abdullah's release^ he passed through Bampur, and rendered his allegiance to the Persian Governor, who subsequently made him his Naib. In this captivity he has aided in levying imposts from his former friend, Din Mahomed, from whom he exacts a yearly tribute of 100 camels. To this was added last year 1,000 sitaramis, all of which exactions are remitted to Bampur.' (vii) Colonel Goldsmid's Second Report of 1864, No. 9, dated Gwadur. 6th February 1864. Page 88, Volume 80 of 1864. 29. In the Second Report is a brief account of a visit to the ports of Charbar and Gwettur. Of the former, it is said— ' The Wali or Governor, Rashid, has his ten Arab attendants, but the protection of the place is left to others. The yearly sum for which the revenues are framed is said, on good authority, to be ft6,000. Its disposition is important, as showing the relations of the Imam and his Mekrani neighbours * Rupees 900 to Din Mahomed of Baho, for protective purposes. „ 200 to Mir Abdullah of Geh, ditto. „ 1,000 to the Wali in charge. ,, 3,850 balance, to the Imam, after defraying cost of establishment and incidental expenditure. . ' Gwettur is described as 'a poor village' of about 70 mat-houses and 250 inhabitants. It is situated near the north-west corner of the bay of the same name, hidden to the south-west by the rocky projections which separate it from the beach behind Cape Farsa. I arrived at about 3 p.m . on the 5th February, landed, and, after looking about me, sat down for a time with the respectable old men who are hereditary heads of the community. Haji Morad, Bussole, and Mithano are as patriarchs in this cluster of hovels. They received Haji Abdu, my guide, as an old acquaintance; my own reception was as cordial and friendly as could have been expected. One of the three brothers spoke Persian and Hindustani fluently, so we had no difficulty in becoming mutually intelligible. impressions of Pussni in 1862 were not favourable to the rule of Faquir Mahomed of ^ e j- Those of Gwettur were not more so as regards Mahomed Ali, Judgal, of Baho^ its actual Chief; and the condition of the two ports is not so different as mio-ht at hist sight appear. Faquir Mahomed has, or had, a certain revenue to realize, for whiclT he is accountable to his Khan. Mahomed Ali has a like part to play on behalf of Mir Abdullah of Ijren, the agent of Bampur, and exactor of the Persian tribute. He or Din Mahomed, his co-ruler, or both, had been summoned from Baho to Deh at the period of my visit to Gwettur. ****** ' Morad pays rupees 400 per annum, as farmer of the Gwettur revenues; but there nor a sll0 P or store-house.

No. 18, data] Baghdad, 27ch April 1864. 80 ; ColoIle l Goldsmid's Third Eeport Volume so of 1864. may be more lully quoted : Bearing in mind the original question of c how far the claims of Persia, Kelat, or Maskat, or any other State, to any sovereign right in any town or districts in Mekran are founded on reaiy or possession, or acknowledgment by the local rulers/ my previous letters will have shown :— That, in my opinion, the claims of Persia to Mekran generally are based upon somewhat traditionary conquests of former years, more or less substantiated by the formal disposal of the province to Mohbut Khan Brahui in the middle of the last century ; that the later rise of a new Government and enterprise of a new Chief in Baluchistan virtually dispossessed Persia of her never well-defined Mekran territories; but that forcible reassertion of the Shah^s sovereignty over certain parts of Mekran, so far as hitherto carried out, however unwarrantable in accordance with the rule of European politics, is not a matter with which we can interfere upon a bare principle of justice and equity. In this view, such Mekran territories as Persia now holds in tribute, are hers by mere right of possession. II'—That those portions of Mekran obeying the authority of the Khan of Kelat are that Chief^s by possession, and also by acknowledgment of the local rulers. They are part of an inherited Baluchistan State, held, at first, in ^M&lt;m'-feudal tenure from Persia, subsequently from Candahar, but in reality on a basis of independence. The revolutions which distracted the province after the deathof Nussir Khan in 1 795 can only effect such petty Chiefdoms as have been successful in permanently throwing off their allegiance. Those which revolted and were afterwards subdued still remain cotnponent parts of the inheritance of the Khans. III.—-That Charbar and Gwadnr belong to the Imam of Maskat by right of posses sion—the last on a tenure disputed by the Beluchis ; the former with acknow ledgment of the local rulers. ' Setting aside nice geoarraphical distinctions, and regarding Mekran as that part of Balucbistm westward of Kelat, Kharan, and Bela, we find a political status much as follows : — Persian, West. EampurDizzuk and dependencies ; Geh and dependencies—Baho Dastyari. Beluch, East. Kej and dependencies—Punjgur. Arab. Charbar in the west, Gwadur the east division. * * * ' My letter No. 5, of 22nd January last, will, it is believed, have rendered clear Bampur. district (and town) was not only independent of Persia more than fifty years ago, but that it was customary for its Chief to organize plundering expeditions from thence into the neighbouimg province of Kerman. It also expressed a commonly received, opinion on the immediate cause of advance to this particular quarter in about ISM. I have seen no reason to modify the conclusion drawn from these statements. Much more evidence might be adduced on the subject, but the strong positive testimony of Captain Grant and Lieutenant Pottinger is readily available for reference. It is not unreasonable to infer that the spirit in which the marauding Chiefs of Bampur carried on their ckapaos across the border gave evidence of intended reprisal for former oppression ; and the fact of possession by Persia at the present day must be attributed to force only, not to the existence of any legitimate claim, or acknowledgment by local rulers. The Nharuis, like their neighbours, obeyed the orders of their own Chief, whose true position was that of a feudatory of Baluchistan, ' Dizzuk, though not on the sea coast, forms a very important part of Northern Mekran Dizzuk, including Jalk, Sibb, Erokbshan, Wlt . llin Ji* 1 ® Version line of possession. But the Habshan, Bampusbt, Moitan, Hung, Zyarut, ma in object or including it within the range on Kalpurakan, etc., etc. the present enquiry is to use it as a key to the whole question under discussion. Frequent per sonal intercourse with its acknowledged hereditary Chief has enabled me to summarize a narrative which tells, more or less literally, the tale of Bampur, of Geh, and of every pettv State in Mekran. J * J ' When Nadir Shah was in the zenith of his power, he bestowed Dizzuk, in free gift* on the ancestor of the present Chief. When Nussir Khan became ruler in Baluchistan, Dizzuk fell within his range of control. He shook off the Persian yoke, and while transferring 2136 F. D.2G his nominal allegiance to Afghanistan, became de facto an independent Sovereign. By him Dizzuk was formally made over to Nyamut Ullah,* the present Chiefs grandfather. At a still later period the King of Persia, Futteh Ali Shah, or his Governors, made occasional demands of tribute, and exacted payment of the same from Dizzuk. Later again, under Mahomed Shah, no such claim on behalf of Persia was ever advanced. Under the reigning Shah not only is tribute exacted from Dizzuk ; but Alim Khan, its Chief, has been to Tehran, and received there his grant of the district in due form. Some say that, on pretence of making a pilgrimage to Mecca, Alim Khan is again on his way to the Persian capital. This I do not believe ; but a relative, Juma Khan, petty Chief of Erokhshan, is professedly proceeding thither to complain of oppression on the part of the local authorities. ' In a report of the Reverend Mr. Badger to Government, dated the 5th June 1861, he says that the Persians ( have lately retaken the district of Dizzuk from Azad Khan, a firm ally of the Dost/ Now Azad Khan of Kharan is the very Chief of whom it was currently reported, in the stirring year 1857, that he offered his services to Persia ; but such is the comiition of affairs in Baluchistan that the two accounts may be reconciled, and rendered credible by the admission of the fact that three or four years lat^r he was acting on his own account, or on behalf of Candahar. The truth is that these petty Beluch States, instead of uniting under one recognized head, have no bond of common interest to keep them together, and become the prey of their most powerful neighbour for the time being, whether Persia, Afghanistan, or a Beluch Sardar of superior power and ability. I need scarcely add that Dizzuk is now Persian by possession, 'ihe acknowledgment of the local rulers 1 believe to 'be compulsory. ******* ' As to the claims of Persia to the revenues, or any portion of the revenues of Geh , and Sirbaz, or to the exercise of any sovereign ie an ir az. right in those minor States, I see no actual right beyond possession for the last 10 or 12 years. Mir Abdullah pays and collects tribute from Geh and its dependencies, and Mir Bayan may do the same in Sirbaz ; but this state of things does not imply acknowledgment by the local rulers any more than in Dizzuk. I am not prepared to say that there are no old exactions of tribute admissible as evidence that Persia, in her moments of spasmodic strength, claimed a share of Geh or Sirbaz revenues since the days of Nadir Shah; for the Beluchis of Dizzuk tell me that these countries were once part of the inheritance of Alim Khan's forefathers, who did, now and then, pay such demands. Dizzuk and Bampur are, however, more convenient in situation for the easy ingress of the Persian collectors. There are roads to Dizzuk from the west by Surhud, and from the north by Seistan; and Bampur is close to the Kerman frontier. But as a matter of right there can be no claim. Geh and Sirbaz were disconnected from Persia when Nussir Khan held them as part of consolidated Baluchistan, being himself the sovereign head of the Beluchi and Brahui tribes of that province. Viewed geographically they belong to the latter State. Politically, they are parts of the ^reat Beluch feudality, which only needs a second Nussir Khan to become a formidable confederacy. The levy of tribute during the last few years is a mere proof that Persia has become, for the time, stronger than her uncivilized and comparatively unknown eastern neighbours, or more at leisure to direct her attention towards them ; and, doubtless, she has had stronger reasons for the step than are apparent to the minor Beluch Chiefs, who suffer from the changes in her political barometer. ' Opportunity has failed me to see the two Chiefs of this district, or either of them, l ut Baho Past' ' ^ ave v i s ^ e( ^ s^ 101 ' 68 an( i taken trustworthy oral evidence, to the effect that never within the memory of man have they paid tribute to Persia, until within the last very few years. One of the two, Mahomed Ali, less than a year ago, opened a correspondence with the Political Agent aft Gwadur on the subject of Persian oppression. The other, in October last, placed his services at the Agent's disposal, if required. I learn, moreover, that Mahomed Ali had an interview with Lieutenant Ross at Gwadur, at which he may, very naturally, have broached the question of his complaints. To these communications, written or personal, no answer can, it is con ceived, be given than that we regret the existence of the grievances, but can do nothing to remove them. Yet, unfortunately, these are the very answers which are unintelligible to a rude Beluch. He cannot comprehend how an arm, stronger than that of Nadir, can remain passive when invited to easy conquest, and its, to them, brilliant consequences. My experience has not shown me that they always put the best construction on our acts ; and, however essential to disavow that any but the most peaceful intentions influence our movements in Mekran, I fear it will be a long time before they arrive at the truth. They have a certain amount of rough honesty, these Mekranis of the interior ; but it is a sentiment little akin to that which guides our present avowed policy in the East. And no wonder that the idea of a mighty nation sending its Agents to a barren, inhospitable shore for the mere sake of working a wire affixed to posts j is, at first, incomprehensible. * This locally gathered information is in accordance with Pottinger'B mention of Naymut Ullah in 1810— History of Baluchistan, page 149.27 Before entenng into detail, I would premise that the Khan of Kelat is nnmistakahlv the so e representative of sovereign power recognized at the present day in Baluchistan. If l/ussir Khau wasa fcudatory atall it was only when Ahmed Shah of Candahar was strong enough to beat him in the field ; and when Ahmed Shah or his successors failed to achieve this end, Nussir Khan was independent There was then no right or justice in the matter, any more than m the ignored claim of Persia to the same privileges, when the tribes of Baluchistan revolting against the successor of Nnssir Khan, and so destroying their own confederacy, became a comparatively easy prey to more powerful nations about them. But, except where a tribe passed over volunfarily to the service of a foreign State, no acknowledgment of subservience on the part of local rulers was implied. Of the Mekran districts of Baluchistan, none was of greater note m the days of short-lived Bclueh nationality than Kei, which contained, the capital.

One gtorv was that the Governor ot Kerman was aiding him in its enforcement anot icr that Ibrahim Khan of Bampur was himself advancing to that district The quest.on naturally occurs, should such an invasion of friendly territory take place, while Government has an Ao-ent at Kelat, and another at Gwadur, what course wonld it be advisable to puisne. I learnt at Gwadur this vear that eighteen months ago a large body of horsemen came down trom Bampur to the Dusht in Kelat territory, and assaulted the Beluehis. More than one member of the family of the Jeoni petty Chiefs was killed on the occasion ; I have a record of their name?. It may be oat of my province to pursue the enquiry upon this point any farther, but I would most respectfully resubmit that an understanding with Persia on the boundary question, one which she has shown no aversion to discus?, might save future difficulty and complications. ' A very few words will suffice to dispose of Charbar and Gwadur the rights to which J , _ have already been so fully discussed, i have no Charbar and Gwadur. hesitation in recording an opinion that Persia has no sort of claim to either one or the other. The first is clearly the Imam s by right of conquest and long uninterrupted possession. That his tenure is acknowledged by the local Rulers is clear, inasmuch as thev receive a portion of the revenues for protecting the port from the interior. The sole argument that Persia could put forward in her own behalf would be that when the Imam got possession of Charbar, it formed part of a district, the sovereignty over which was her own right, and could not be fairly forfeited by forcible conquest of her Belnch subjects. But it is evident to my mind that Charbar was at the time situated in the territory of Geh or Sirbaz, or some contiguous Chiefdom, which was subject to Nussir Khan Brahui, or independent. As regards Gwadur, the only claim of which cognizance^ can be taken is that of the Beluchis, who deny the free ^ift to the Imam. But this question need not here be re-opened, and, whichever way decided, has no connection with the rights of Persia. If Gwadur were Persian, Kej would, geographically considered, be so too, for it is the port of that district; but Kej is still within the line of Kelat frontier in Mekran, and it is hoped will continue so until the Khan's territory is sufficiently strengthened and defined to render him independent, as his great predecessor Nussir, of extraneous aid.'29 CHAPTER III. Agreements with the Sultan of Maskat in eonnection with the pro posed telegraphic line along the coast between Gwadur and Bunder Abbas, 1864-65. Colonel Felly's report on the country from Bunder Abbas to Jask, 1864. 30 A. In connection with the proposed telegraphic line along the coast Political A, December 1864, Nos. 123-124. between Gwadur and Busliire, Colonel Pelly s opinion was asked especially m regard to the strip of the coast from Bunder Abbas and Gwadur. In his letter to the Bombay Government, No. 57, dated 16th October 1864, he observed :— 2. It appears to me that the objects we have in view are— Is tit/. —To get this line made as quick as possible; 2ndly. —To have it efficiently superintended \ and Srdly. —To avoid raising any territorial questions and to avoid also committing ourselves to the acknowledgment of any territorial jurisdictions. 3. The territory to be traversed from Bushire to Gwadel is divisible— Idly. —Into territory which all parties acknowledge to be directly under Persia, viz., the littoral of the Persian Gulf from Bushire to a point near Bunder Abbss j 2ndly. —Territory which both the Shah^s Government and the Sultan of Maskat acknowledo-e to be territory belonging to Persia, but farmed by Maskat, viz., the littoral of the gulf from the point above alluded to near Bunder Abbas to an undefined point to the eastward of Bunder Abbas; and Srdly. —Territory of unnamed jurisdiction lying an undefined distance along the shore line between Bunder Abbas and Gwadel. 4. The course I would follow is that which I recently followed in regard to Chiefs on the Arab littoral of the gulf, viz., that of making everything depend on person without specifying territory. This principle cculd be applied in the present instance by obtaining from the Sultan of Maskat a document declaratory of his permission for us to extend the line of telegraph along any and all territories which he might possess, or which he might lease on the Persian and Mekran shores; such document further binding His Highness to punish any of his subjects or dependants who may commit any act of aggression or trespass on the telegraph lines, stations, or material, on the same being brought to his notice. 5. A similar document might be obtained from the Shah's Government in regard to any and all territory which His Majesty mi^ht have leased to the Maskat State and in regard to any and all territory to which His Majesty might lay claim along the shore line to the southward and eastward of Bunder Abbas. Extension of telegraph line from BusJiire to Bunder Abbas. 6. These documents obtained, we could continue our line beyond Gwadel to Bunder Abbas in the same manner as we have done it to Gwadel, and we could arrange with the Shah's Government for connecting the Bunder Abbas districts with Bushire either in the manner we had followed from Gwadel, or under arrangements similar with those which obtain in regard to the line between Bushire and Tehran. 30 B. In October 1864, Mr. Alison, Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran^ Political A, January 1865, Nos. 115-116. having communicated with the ^sian Government about the extension or the wire to Bunder Abbas, enquired whether the Sultan of Maskat would agree to the proposed extension. Colonel Pelly was thereupon directed by the Bombay Government to proceed to Maskat, and after conferring with the Sultan arrange matters as best as he thought proper. 30 0. Colonel Pelly accordingly proceeded to Maskat, on November 1864 and obtained the Sultan's signature to an *AitcluWs Treaties (1892), \roinine xi, agreement,* dated 17th November 1864, page ' ' authorising the construction of telegraph lines anywhere appertaining to the State of Maskat or in any territories which the Sultan might hold on lease from the Shah of Persia. The agreement aha 4626 F. D,30 provides that the Maskat Government shall not interfere with telegraphic operations and punish interference by Maskat subjects or dependents. It also confirms the title of the British Government to the station at Bassidore. 30 D. A Convention was also signed by the Sultan of Maskat on 19th January 1865, authorizing the construe- AiSut XW 76. tion of telegraph lines in his dominions both m Arabia and Mekran and pro viding that his protection should be afforded to telegraph lines, stations and employes. It also provides that disagreements arising between telegraph officials and the Sultan's subjects in his Arabian dominions should be referred to for decision to the British Political Officer at Maskat, and such as arise in his possessions in Mekran to the Assistant British Political Officer at Gwadur. 30 E. In November-December 1864, Colonel Pelly made a journey n i* a *i 1 see 'M from Bunder Abbas to Jask in view to Political A, April 1866, Noa. 10^106. . . , . « .,... ,i- j. j» examining what tacilities the nature of this strip of the coast and the temper of its inhabitants might afford for the proposed extension of our telegraphic operations. As a result of this journey Colonel Pelly submitted to Government interesting reports about the routes and other matters connected with the country and also a report con taining some physical information prepared by Dr. Colvill, all of which were considered as of great value in the event of arrangements being concluded for extending the Mekran telegraph line to Bunder Abbas (Bombay Government to the Government of India, No. 55, dated 11th April 1865).CHAPTER IV. Negotiations with Persia for Telegraphic Extension, westward, from Gwadur, 1865-68. Telegraph Convention of 1868.* 31. In June 1865, under instructions received from the Secretary of State for India, Lieutenant-Colonel Goldsmid, who had succeeded the late Lieutenant-Colonel P. Stewart as Chief Director of the Indo-European Tele graph, was deputed to Teheran to assist Her Majesty's Minister at the Court of Persia in negotiating a Telegraph Treaty. On the 19th August a Bombay Government Resolution was forwarded to that officer, asking his opinion te as to the extreme limit to which the aerial line can be extended westward from Gwadur without opposition or reasonable objection from the Persian Government ?' No. 73 of 4tii October 1865. 32. In the reply were the following Vide letter to Secretary of State, No. 49 of paragraphs I— 21st November. ' The question of ' opposition' differs from that of ' reasonable objection.' Judging from former proceedings and former correspondence, opposition of some kind has distinctly been made by the Persian Government to an advance along the coast west of Gwadur, without their consent obtained. The statement of the Minister for Foreiori Affairs to this effect in May 1863 is on record; and Mr. Thomson, then Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, explained that Persia wanted to have assured the coast from Charbar to frontier of Bunder Abbas. My own reading of their objections is, that they bear also upon the coast from Gwadur to Charbar, ' As to ' reasonable objection/ I have already had the honour of reporting. It seems to me that they have really none to urge as regards the coast from Kurrachee to the eastern limit of the lands farmed by the Imam of Muscat, But this is a question on which I think we should discuss the merits with Persia herself. Such discussion cannot throw us back in our general course ; and its result must serve to place our acts on a securer basis than if we moved bindfolded. Besides, and I make this suggestion in all deference, we do not then hamper successive politicians with the defence of a line of policy or proceeding on which there is no record, but that we came, saw, and planted our telegraph post.' And an extract from a semi- official letter written shortly before the above reference had been made, and accompanying the reply, contained a proposition to treat on the boundary question ; &lt;e Persia has asked for British interference in adjusting her eastern boundary. The request bas been declined in the way put by her Ministers. But might not the settlement of boundary be accepted on behalf of the Kelat State of Beluchistan, so very recently invaded by Persian troops? The Chief of that State, who really owes no allegiance, nor acknowledges any to the Shah—the inheritor, moreover, of an independent dominion—is our firm ally and protege, and is desirous of consolidating his power. In aiding him to define his western frontier, the British authorities are not seeking to define which are Persian and which not Persian territories. All that they would require is a guarantee from Persia that she will not permit her soldiers or subjects to pass a certain line of frontier considered to mark the Kelat boundary. ' The sole difficulty that I see in the way, is in the discontent likely to be raised among the petty Beluch Chiefs on the west of the Kelat line, who may look upon themselves as given over to Persia by this arrangement. The point is, no doubt, one of great delicacy, but it is presumed that the question must be met if the Telegraph line is to be run eventually through these tracts of country, I cannot but believe that we might come to a satisfactory understanding with the Persians to the effect that up to the long stripe of coast farmed by the Imam of Muscat, of which Bunder Abbas is the western extremity, we treat the local Chiefs as independent in regard to any subsidy given; but carefully stipulate a policy of non interference in the general question of suzerainty, in which we neither acknowledge or disown the Persian claim.' 33. Lieutenant-Colonel Goldsmid's telegram of the 23rd November 1865 reported to the Bombay Government completion of the Anglo-Persian Tele- No. 366 Of 6th December 1865. S ra P h Convention. He solicited orders for further movements. A Eesolution of Government informed him, in reply, he should use his own discretion as to route to Bombay, especially if he could do 44 anything to promote a branch land line to meet Government line in Mekran.' * For telegraphs in general in the Persian Gulf, see Precis on Commerce and Communications in the Persian Gulf.32 34. On receipt of the telegram conveying this authority, Lieutenant- Colonel Goldsmid and Major Smith, E E., Director, Persian Telegraph, proceeded together from Tehran to Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman. At a hundred miles eastward of the last-named place they parted. Major Smith explored the route to Bunder Abbas, and to some extent along the coast; and Colonel 1866. Goldsmid went on to Bampur in Balu- tfo. 27 of mh March 1866. chistan, and thence through the Mekran passes to the sea at Charbar. A report of this exploration was forwarded to Government. Three paragraphs are here extracted. ' The question of Persian occupation in Beluchistan has, I think, been fairly solved by the present journey. In modern maps we are accustomed to find a red line drawn in about long 1 . 59°, and coming* westward to long. 54° EO' 7 , as defining the eastern boundary o£ Persia from Seistan to the Indian Ocean. The state as the case is, however, very different in reality. We should be much nearer the truth were the line to curve to the eastward before reaching the sea, taking in, from the Bampur District southwards, a tract in extent nearly four degrees of longitude. The Wazir of Kerman, Mahomed Ismail Khan, de facto Governor of the province, has lately received from his Sovereign the title of Sirdar of Beluchistan, and the honour is nob in this instance mere sound and emptiness. Attached to Kerman and forming its Beluehistan Division, are the two large districts of! Barapur and Mekran. The first, which lies to the north, is about as much Persia as Kerman Proper. It is governed by a Persian, and garrisoned by Persian regular troops, as well as irregulars and Beluchis. The second, Mekran, on the south, is immediately under Bampur, but is governed by a Beluch; and there are, as a rule, no Persian troops to garrison its towns or forts. The system of Government prevailing here is to acknowledge every legitimate Chief who, on his side, acknowledges the Persian supremacy, or to set up an obedient competitor who is not likely to be wanting. 'When I passed down from JL5ampur to the sea, one Shai Abdullah, Chief of Kussur- kund, had been recently murdered. The Persians acknowledged the son in succession, but divided his father's Chiefdom. Shai Abdullah had held both Sirbaz and Kussurkund. The son retained only the latter, Sirbaz being bestowed upon Chakur Nharui, a Chief well affected to the sovereign power. The policy, such as it was, did not serve to stifle the suspicion that Persia had instigated the murder of Abdullah, for the victim was 'her avowed antagonist. Consequently the Kussurkund, or direct road from Bampur to Gwadur, was reported unsafe, and the authorities were unwilling that I should proceed by it. But the road to Charbar by Fanoch, though more circuitous, was to all appearance quiet. I travelled along it a distance of 331 miles, under the escort of an old Persian sent by the Governor of Bampur, and his four Beluch attendants; my own two Persian servants made up the whole party. We had started with two armed Beluchis, but they left us before entering the pass. Of the rest I was the only one who could boast of firearms ; each wore the costume of his country, and there was no attempt at disguise. The Wakil-ul-Mulk had urged upon me the propriety of adopting a Persian cap between Bam and Bampur, and a Beluch dress between Bampur and the sea ; but I saw no occasion to follow the advice, nor did others press it on reaching the named localities. As for my servants one wore a bright green and the other a chocolate vest, as though newly arrived from the Tehran bazars. If our presence ever caused a feeling of mistrust and alarm, there was certainly no attempt at molestation ; and my guide was well known as a collector of revenue. The old man assured me that the sight of his Kerman skull-cap was sufficient to warn off intruders • - Called '• Gujjurs' by Beluohu. 'l' 2 notio, i that T, Were a ^ oE ' Ca j al s though not favourable to intercourse with the people, was certainly conducive to peace and privacy. I took advantage of every opportunity to declare my nationality, bub the company in which I travelled was not calculated to invite confidence. The Persian tenure of the sea-coast is not like that of Bampur. The Minister of Kerman frankly told us he would give no passports for landing there. Ibrahim Khan said he would take no responsibility for the Telegraph along the shores west of Gwadur and Jeoni The country is theirs, inasmuch as tribute is paid to Persia by Mir Abdullah, Chief of Geh' and he repays himself by levies from his neighbours. Din Mahomed, Judgal, who has imme diate control of the Coast from Charbar to the frontier of Kej, is married to Mir Abdullah's sister, and may therefore be supposed in some way attached to his interests. There is no mistake about the line of boundary with Kej, which is clearly defined. It is -just as I formerly surmised and reported. A point in Gwettur Bay, the mouth of the Dusht Khor is the termination, on the sea-board, of a line drawn east of Jalk and Dizzuk from Seistan' as illustrated in the annexed tracing. Sirbaz and Pisheng are on the Persian side. Toomp and Jeoni belong to Kej of Kelat. My opinion is that if we wish to set up a line of Teleffranh from Gwadur to Bunder Abbas or elsewhere, to join the present Persian line, we must treat with Persia for permission to do so ; only the reference should be made advisedly.-' 35. Erom the journey and Report above noted, resulted a new proposal to treat with Persia for a line of Telegraph, branching from the main line at Ispahan, to Yezd, Kerman and Bunder Abbas; the Mekran Coast Line beinff extended westward to the latter station from Gwadur. In submitting the33 scheme to the Government of India, the Chief Director of the Indo-European Telegraph dwelt upon its advantages in a general point of view, and added : &lt;l Little or nothing has been said of the political results of the Convention contemplated; . . * .. . t&gt; i ^ but it is hoped they are not unimportant. Accompaniment to letter to Bombay Govern- A . , , rT ^ 'c i a ment. No 66 of 11th Ma, 1866. Article VI secures a frontter beyond our own frontier, and from what has transpired already in Persia, it is believed that this Article might be carried. Mirza Said Khan, the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs, told Colonel Goldsmid, in discussing the question five months ago, that the Governor of Kerman would decide up to what point eastward his control would reach. The Governor of Kerman frankly admitted that lie had nothing to say to Gwadur, and had little power on the sea coast, but at the same time his authority enabled Colonel Goldsmid to proceed unmolested with a guide and no actual escort through the passes o£ Mekran to Charbar. Major Smith in like manner reached Bunder Abbas, and afterwards landed at Jask, marching four stages thence to the eastward. The Governor of Bampur, the chief district of Beluchistan, who had formerly openly opposed our coming to Gwadur, defined his frontier and that of Kelat to Colonel Goldsmid with sufficient clearness to set the question at rest. But if we do not secure this boundary by Treaty, the Persians may yet encroach to the eastward of the line, in the same way that they have encroached during the last twenty years. It is most respectfully represented that the Telegraph offers a means of interference on our part in this matter which may not again be available.' 36. The Article alluded to was roughly drafted thus: This is the point to which it was supposed, on ' VI.—It is, however, stipulated that no th^occasion of former enquiries, that Persian political interference will be exercised by the encroachment to the east had extended, and the Govemmen t of Persia in the port of Gwadur or status has now been confirmed. The precise 0 , , * xr ■&gt; , 2. c ±1. ^ boundary is near the Drabol Hill, a few miles ^l 16 State of Kelat, or any other port of the coast west of the river named. east of the Dusht Khor, in the Bay of Gwettur. 3^. The &lt;c Governor of Bampur' mentioned, is Ibrahim Khan, whose courtesy and general behaviour as host, on the occasion in question, merits recognition in a consideration of his less reputable public acts and character among the Mekran Baluchis. The ' boundary ' signified, as nearly as can be defined on an illustration which has no pretensions to accuracy, is marked on the accompanying map. 38. The concurrence and support of the Government of India and of Bombay having been accorded, the scheme was developed and submitted in detail to the Secretary of State for India; and eventually took the form of a draft Convention of several Articles. But before an approved draft was for warded to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, many alterations had been made in the original, and notably the Article restricting Persian 'claims*' to the territory west of the Dusht Khor was struck out in Her Majesty's Poreign Office. It was not thought desirable to mix up a political question with one which was, or should be, purely telegraphic. But, while accepting the amend ments suggested, the Secretary of State for India addressed the Foreign Office to the effect that, although the question of boundary had been withdrawn from the draft Convention, it was one of considerable importance in every sense; and. it would appear very desirable that Mr. Alison should be specially instructed to bear it in mind in the course of negotiation. 39. In October 1866 Lieutenant-Colonel Goldsmid left London, under Secretary of State for India, to the Governor instructions from Lord Cranborne, to pro of Bombay in Council, No. 25 of 30th November ceed to Tehran, to be placed by Mr. Alison 1866 - e{ in direct communication with the Persian authorities, * * and entrusted, under Mr. Alison's superin tendence and control, with the chief conduct of the negotiations respecting the proposed telegraphic arrangements.' Detention on duty at Constan tinople prevented his arrival at Tehran till February. Negotiations commenced, interviews and messages passed, but it soon became apparent that the occasion was unfavourable, and about two months later. Her Majesty's Minister wrote as follows;— ' After repeatedly pressing the subject of our proposals respecting the Telegraph on the Mr. Alison, to Colonel Goldsmid, 16th April serious attention of the Persian Government, I 1867. have just received the final answer of the King, namely, that His Majesty cannot at present entertain these proposals. a As the King is about to leave this in a few days, on a pilgrimage to Meshed, I do not cousider that anything further can be done in the matter at this time.' 4626 F. D.84 40. A Report on this subject had already been addressed by the Chief So. 17, dated 2lst March 1867. Director of the Telegraph to the Bombay Government. Accompanying were copies of a correspondence with Her Majesty's Minister in Persia during the negotia tions. The following extract from memorandum of an interview with the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs shows the little willingness or little power of that functionary to discuss the question of the Coast Telegraph, even apart from the larger and more comprehensive scheme :— No course now remained, but to put the alternative of the line from Gwadur to Jask • , ^ , „r --t i a i» under a guarantee. This I did in general terms, . O'' 0 ™' fZ ' ' and discussion ensued, and the Persian map of the country was referred to, I explained that any details into which I might enter must be considered as brought forward by me as Director of the Indo-European Telegraph, not as a Political Officer. I was naturally interested on behalf of telegraphic communication, and knew the tracts discussed, perhaps, better than any one in Tehran, from actual inspection. The sea-coast was comparatively cut off from the upper country by a rugged hill range. The Beluchis of these hills had little to say to the coast, which was mostly inhabited by poor fishermen. The Wakil-ul-Mulk, Minister of Kerman (to whom I had more than a year ago been referred by Mirza Said Khan himself, for information as to his eastern boundary), had himself told me he had no authority b^ the sea board, nor could he even authorize Major Smith to proceed there, though he could readily pass me to Bam pur, a point further east, but within the hill range. The ease was therefore simply this, i.e., the Persians admitted they could not protect a Telegraph line along the coast of Beluchistan. We have already done all we needed in that respect from Kurrachee to Gwadur. It would be easy enough to do the same on this side of the coast. It seemed to me that a guarantee of non-interference in the political part of the question could be in no way detrimental or unsatisfactory. ' Mirza Said Khan made no definite or distinct replies, but repeated the general argu ment that his Government was not ready to come to any understanding on the erection of a line of Telegraph in Beluchistan or Persia Proper. He hoped I would not press it.' 41. As stated, however, in the Chief Director's subsequent Progress No. 83 of 22nd Jnne 1867&gt; paragraph 2. . Report to the Government of Bombay, Secretary of State for India, to Governor of there Was &lt;s good reason to believe ' that Bombay, No. 4 of 7th May 1868, Appendix A. this very questioI1 o£ the Coast Telegraph could &lt;{ be re-opened within the year, and with fair prospect of success.' The anticipations thus recorded proved true. Later in the year at Tehran the King had returned from his pilgrimage to Meshed. And in London, the matter had been resubmitted to the India Office. Later still, Mr. Alison, under instruc tions from the Foreign Office, took up the thread of the argument, only temporarily abandoned, and negotiations recommenced in earnest. 42. The progress and result of these negotiations may be seen in the following extracts of letters addressed to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs :— I.—'In pursuance of the instructions contained in Your Lordship's despatch No. 38 of Mr. Alison, to Lord Stanley, 27tli October. ^ ® rd ? £ September I sought an interview with the rersian Minister tor foreign Affairs, for the purpose of renewing the negotiations for the line of Telegraph extending from Gwadur along the Mekran Coast. ' After I had stated briefly the obiect and proposals of His Majesty's Government, the Minister went over the reasons which had induced the Persian Government to decline discussing or entering upon any negotiations on this subject. Persia, he said, apprehensive that the erection o£ a line of Telegraph solely by the agents of a foreign power, in districts over which she at present exercised only a limited authority, might have the effect of imperilling that authority, of diminishing her influence, and, perhaps, even of affecting her frontier line. It would require an army to protect such a telegraphic line, and in her inability to provide one for that purpose, the task of protecting the line would naturally form the subject of an agreement between the British Government and the local Chiefs, and this likewise would tend to disparage the Persian Government, and to render those Chiefs more or less independent of her authority. The Minister was not aware of any instance in which our Government had been permitted to erect telegraphic lines at its own expense, and by its own agents, in the territory of another. If the main object to be attained were to provide against the contingency of the disablement of the submarine cable, the British Government might easily provide another cable, to be ready in case of accident. * * ^ * Persia had hitherto been unable to con solidate her authority on the Mekran Coast, owing to the want of sufficient pecuniary means, but she had lately turned her serious attention towards that object, and not without hopes of succeeding.35 ' I observed to the Minister that the interest which the British Government had always evinced for the welfare and integrity of Persia afforded her sufficient proof that we would not propose to her any measure which might have the effect of impairing her authority, or of depriving her of a part of her territory. Indeed, the proposals now made of associating Persia in an undertaking to be carried into effect in districts over which the authority of the Shah was so very vague, afforded a proof of the friendly disposition of His Majesty^s Government; and although the Persian Government was not in a position itself to protect the telegraphic line projected, the fact of her receiving a yearly subvention towards that purpose evinced the interest which was felt in maintaining, and not impairing, her influence. Persia had therefore nothing to lose, and something to gain, besides the merit of contributing towards a useful object; while the British Government was ready to declare that the arrangements to be entered into would in no manner affect any rights claimed by Persia in the districts through which the line was to pass. ' The Minister, who did not impress me with the idea of being favourable to the scheme, promised to lay the subject before the King, and state to him what bad taken place at our conference, while I engaged, on my part, to draw up two Articles respecting the project, to be submitted for His Majesty^s inspection.' II.—' I considered it desirable to communicate confidentially with the Shah on the Mr. Alison, to Lord Stanley, 18th November. o£ th 1 e P™P 0S,!l1 ' iue f Telegraph from Gwadur westwards. After several messages to and fro, I had the satisfaction of learning that the King had approved generally of the scheme, and that, confident in the assurances that I had conveyed to him, he might be disposed to do even more than I expected. ' The Minister for Foreign Affairs, after some days elapsed, sent me a message on the subject of the two Articles which had been submitted to the King. His Majesty had taken objection to the passages underlinpd, * * and, at the recommendation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I had no difficulty in expunging them. It was thus to be expected that the Articles so modified would have been accepted without further discussion. 'On the 15th Mr. Thomson was invited by the Minister to proceed to his house, to convey to me the King's answer to the proposals respecting the new line. The first munshi having received intimation of a counter-project entertained by the Persian Government, which would, in my opinion, imply a recognition by the British Government of the right of Persia to a jurisdiction over territory as far as Gwadur, I instructed Mr. Thomson to point out to the Minister the necessity of avoiding anything of a political tendency in the arrange ments under discussion, 'The counter-project of the Shah is contained in the enclosed copy of Mr. Thomson' Report: ' 'The Persian Government would purchase the material in England, and construct the line at their own cost, under the superintendence of English officers, and would also undertake to guard it, and allow it to be worked by an English staff of telegraphers.' ''This scheme, however plausible, seemed to me so impracticable and so objectionable in some respects, that I waited on the Minister the following day to elicit further explanations on the subject. His Excellency having requested me to state my objections to the King's project, I begged that he Would first thank His Majesty for having taken this matter into favourable consideration, and recognized the necessity of erecting the land line under discussion. It was my duty to give due consideration to anything coming from the King, but the only object in contemplation was an efficient telegraphic line, and the King's project did not appear to me calculated to attain that object. In the first place, it presented the difficulty of involving political discussions, which it was sought so much to avoid. According to their proposal, they would commence operations in the territory of the Khan o£ Kelat, which extended westwards to the Dusht Khor, and this would naturally be opposed, ' The Minister met this objection by saying that operations might be commenced at the other end, and that subject taken up as an approach was made towards the Kelat country, ' Nevertheless, I begged that His Excellency would state my views of these difficulties to His Majesty, and point out to him bow well calculated to obviate and overcome them was the plan which had been submitted to him. We should not desire to see Persia binding herself by Treaty to do impossible things. The Minister had himself observed that they had little or no authority in the district through which the line was to pass, and that they would require an army to protect it. If they bound themselves by Treaty to do so under such circumstances, we should have ever recurring occasion to remind them of their engage ments. They might, in consequence, become involved in disagreeable affairs with the Chiefs of Beluchistan, and, instead of having a Telegraph, we should have opened a source of excess, trouble, and annoyance. ' The Minister, while upholding the willingness and power of the Shah to overcome all foreign difficulties, enquired how the English officers would proceed to work? I said that, furnished with ample funds, they would no doubt pave the way through all difficulties; that a telegraphic line in such a country required rather to be let alone than to be protected, and that the local Chiefs would secure that object for a pecuniary consideration.36 tc His Excellency, while disavowing- any political views on tbe part of his Government, attached much importance to the Shah's project. If agreed to, it might lead to the extension o£ the other line proposed from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and this effort on the part of the King in the way to progress ought to be encouraged, by Great Britain, 'I observed that, of course, the Shah's project was worthy of due attention; that we had a very simple object in view, and that I trusted he would state to His Majesty the difficulties which seemed to me to lie in the way of its attainment. If the Persian Ministers were desirous of discussing 1 the subject of territorial ^rights, I would be willing to enter upon that matter on another occasion. rf The Minister promised to send a Report of our conversation that evening to the Shah.' ***** III.—' I yesterday received a message from the Shah, conveying his desire that I would M. Alison, t „ Lord St M .e y , .1st N o™b eI . TZ Mekran Coast line, but I replied that it was more useful at present to consider the practical means for carrying the work into execution. ' The object of the Persian Government in proposing to lay down and protect the line from Gwadur is, no doubt, to involve Her Majesty's Government in a recognition of their right of sovereignty over the Mekran Coast up to Gwadur, which would include a part ot the territory claimed by the Khan of Kelat. If the subject is pressed, I shall have to explain the political objections entertained by Her Majesty's Government to such recognition; but it is desirable, in the first instance, to make the Persian Government feel as much as possible the objections which exist to their own plan in a practical point of view. ' In making this explanation, it may become advisable to sound the Persian Government on the following pointWhether, in the event of our accepting their proposal to layjdown the line from the Dusht Khor westwards, they would make a separate engagement that no political interference shall be exercised by them in the port of Gwadur or the State of Kelat, or in any other part of the Coast east of the River Dusht Khor, in the Bay of Gwettur ? 'The advantage accruing to Persia from this arrangement would be the virtual recogni tion on the part of the British Government of the right of sovereignty over the Mekran Coast west of the Dusht Khor. With regard to the practical part of the work, it is to be presumed that they would come to an understanding with the Imam of Muscat, and it is likely that they would be nothing loth to fall back on our resources, for it is shown by experience that they have no hesitation to enter into engagements which they have but slender means and feeble intention of carrying out. IV.—^The Shah, having continued to press the point of the construction by Persia of , T Ar . x j cj . i q i. t '\ i the telegraphic line between Jask and Gwadur, I Mr. Alison, to Lord Stanley, 8th Decomber. bavp to his Minj8ter the po i itioal obje0 . tions entertained to their operating in the line of the country between the Dusht Khor and Gwadur, being territory claimed by the Khan of Kelat. The King's view of the subject is contained in the memorandum enclosed in copy. It is set forth that a Telegraphic Convention in the form now proposed by us would clearly and manifestly tend to vitiate the rights of Persia over the districts through which the line would pass. I have endeavoured to point out, in the instructions addressed to Mr. Thomson, * * that there is no ground for such an assertion. ' It is distinctly stated in the memorandum that Kej is considered as forming an integral part of Persia, and it would therefore seem now more than ever inexpedient to accept the terms of a Convention which would confer upon her the right of carrying on operations east of the Dusht Khor.' Memorandum enclosed. 'The Persian Government consider Kej and Mekran integral parts of the province of Kerman, and therefore undoubtedly Persian territory. The ports of Gwadur and Shah • Charbar eyidontty here intended. Bender * are als0 d by , in e ^ etly ^ same category as other ports belonging exclu sively to Persia. No one can now make objection to, or impugn, the territorial rights to Persia on that coast, for hitherto she has not signed any deed or made any admission which could be held to impair or weaken the rights she possesses in that quarter; but a Telegraphic Convention, in the form now proposed by the English Mission, would clearly and manifestly tend to vitiate the rights over the districts in question, for the propositions which have been made leave the matter of right of sovereignty involved in doubt; and, in ratifying such a Convention, Persia would distinctly admit that her right was not absolute. To make this more clear, for instance, if Persia were to conclude a Convention of a similar vague and doubtful nature with any foreign Government regarding the ports in the Caspian, or those on the coast of the Persian Gulf, certainly it would be considered as a document which would render precarious, if it did not vitiate, her territorial rights to these ports. u Supposing that the English Mission should reply to this, that the rights of the Persian Government on the coast of Mekran, such as they now are, will remain the same when the Convention has been signed, the answer of the Persian Government is, that there is a very important difference, because Persia has not hitherto entered into any engagement/ 37 adraitting' a doubt in the matter of her territorial right. At most it may be said that she has not hitherto placed herself in complete possession, or made good her claims ; but once she signs this Convention, she admits as questionable her right, which is in reality undoubted. How then could the English Grovernment, with the friendly sentiments they entertain towards Persia, desire that she should by means of this Convention abrogate her own territorial rights or how could the Persian Ministers bring themselves to assent to such a measure ? 'If therefore the English Mission, as was at first proposed, will conclude a Telegraphic Convention, such as that which provided for the construction of the Bushire and Khanikia line, the Persian Government will not refuse in friendship to do so, but will put up the wire along the coast of Persia, which the English Government requires, from Gwadurto Jask, and thence to Bunder Abbas ; otherwise, let the Persian Government and the English Mission refer the question to London, and orders will be sent to the Persian Charge d'Affaires in England to discuss the matter with the British Ministers. V.—'The Shah has waived his opinion respecting the Articles of Convention submitted for his approval, as conveyed in the Mr. Ahson, to Lorn btanley, 16th December. memorandum of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, enclosed in my despatch No. 133 of the 8th instant, but pressed the point of mention being made of the line and coast up to Gwadur, as ' the Persian Coast' in the Articles in question. As I did not think this admissible, His Majesty has waived this point also, and is now willing to embody in a Convention the three Articles transcribed on the margin in the enclosure. ' On the opposite side is the Article sent in Your Lordship's despatch No. 23, dated the 26th of October 1866, and underneath are my remarks on the modifications made of that Article during the negotiation. ' The Articles, as they now stand, seem to me calculated to meet the requirements of Her Majesty's Government for carrying out the object in view. ' When this part of the subject is satisfactorily disposed of, I will address Your Lordship on the expediency or not of opening negotiations for extending the line from Ispahan to Yezd, Kerman, and Bunder Abbas, as at first intended. 'Modified Draft. ' I. ' Original Draft. ' I. ' In order to provide against possible accident to the Persian Gulf cable * the British Govern ment will arrange with the (1) Khan of Kelat and with the Imam of Muscat and the Chiefs of Beluchistan, with regard to the construction; and (2) maintenance of a line of Telegraph between Gwadur and Bundei Abbas, f (3) it bein^ distinctly understood and admitted on both sides that such arrangement in no way implies a recognition or admission of sovereignty in any parties over the districts through which the line between Gwadur and Bunder Abbas may pass, or in any way affects the rights claimed by Persia over such districts.' ' In order to provide against any possible acci dent to the Persian Gulf cable, it is agreed between the high contracting Governments of England and Persia that the British Government shall make arrangements with regard to the construction and efficient working of a line of Telegraph between Gwadur and a point between Jask and Bunder Abbas. «II. &lt;e The Government of Persia will employ her good offices and authority for facilitating its construction, maintenance, and protection, and in order to enable her to meet any expenses which she may have to incur on its account, the British Government will pay over to her annually the sum of 3,000 Tomans, so that she may protect the line to that extent; the payment of the above sum being made from the day on which the work of laying down the line is commenced.' ***** ' REMARKS. ' 1. The Shah objected to mention being made of the Khan of Kelat, the Imam of Muscat, and the Chiefs of Beluchistan; of the two first because it would, I presume, imply a right on their part to territory claimed by Persia, and of the Chiefs of Beluchistan as derogatory to the Royal dignity. The names being omitted, the Shah's objections are removed, and the British Government remains at liberty to make arrangements with whom ever they like, with the influence and authority of the Shah to back them. &lt;e 2. Objection was made to the Persian word nigahdari, used to render ' maintenance.' His Majesty may have thought that its insertion might invest us with powers prejudicial to his sovereign rights, and when it was explained to him that maintaining the line meant nothing more than maintaining it in efficient working order, he preferred the substitution of * The following words are here erased in the manuscript: ' the Persian Government agree to set up and maintain a land line of telegraph from Ispahan to Yezd and Kerman, and from Kerman to Bunder Abbas, and—' t Erased : ' in connection with the said line between Bunder Abbas and Ispahan.' 2646 F. D.38 are 1868. Mr, Alison, to Lord Stanley, 23rd January. efficient working J to f maintenance/ and it was accordingly made. The British Government thus at liberty to do those things which are necessary for the efficient working of the line. ' 3. The Shah objected to this stipulation, I presume, because he considered that it cast a doubt on what he claims to be his indisputable right, and as it insertion or omission appears to me of no importance to the object in view, it was omitted. ' 4. I do not think that the Shah would have accepted 3,000 Tomans a year to allow us to treat with the Sheikh of Bunder Abbas, or any other Chief on the coast of Beluchistan, nor would he have consented to accept a money grant of 3,000 Tomans a year, on condition of paying it away to Native Chiefs under his rule for the protection of the line. But be would accept it himself, with the proviso that it should be expended in protecting the line, and it was so stipulated. ' 5. It is proposed that the Convention shall remain in for twenty years. If the British Government have no interest working the line during the whole extent of that period, there is nothing which binds them to do so ; and if they wish to renew the Convention if I do not see any obstacle which may prevent their doing so.^ 'VI.—'I communicated, a few days ago, to the Minister of Foreign Affairs a translation into Persian of the modified Article II of a Telegraphic Convention, conveyed to me in Your Lordship's telegram of the 5th instant. ' I received to-day a message from His Excellency to say that the King considered the phrase ' for the use of such parts of the coast and dependencies ' to be vague, and requiring explanation. In the original Article it was made clear that the 3,000 Tomans a year were to be paid to the Persian Government for contributing to protect the line; but it would now seem as if the coast and its dependencies were to be rented for that sum, while it was not apparent for what purpose, and what were the dependencies, and to what use were they to be applied ? 'I answered that the expression ' the use of the coast and dependencies' obviously means their use for telegraphic purposes, and the Under-Secretary, who brought me the King's message, said that it would be necessary to make some alteration in the modified Article, to give expression to that meaning. VII.—'After a great deal of discussion respecting the modification of Article II of the Mr. Allison, to Lord Stanley, 28th Januarv. P ro P ose&lt;i Telegraph Convention the Persian Government agreed to the text sent in my telegram of this date. They wish it to be clear that the 3,000 Tomans a year were to be paid for the use of the Telegraph, and not for the use of the coast and its dependencies. ' They pressed strongly for mention of the whole line of coast being made as belonging to Persia ; but I again explained that we could not agree to that, as both the Khan of Kelat and the Imam oE Muscat had claims on certain portions of it, and they finally withdrew. 'Your Lordship will observe that in the text now modified they engage to protect the line only as far as they can, which seems to be reasonable enough. VIII.— u I received to-day Your Lordship's telegram of the 6th instant, enquiring whether Mr, Alison, to Lord Stanley, 11th April. 1 signed the Convention or come to terms respecting the Mekran Telegraph ? ' I beg to explain that some delay took place in signing the Telegraphic Convention, owing to the extreme backwardness of the Persian Government in granting permission for the establishment of a telegraphic station at Angaum. It seemed to me that the clause introduced into the draft of the Convention would not give us the right to establish such a station, and I was therefore anxious to obtain that concession before signing the Convention, which I had been several times invited by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to conclude. After a good deal of procrastination and evasion on the part of His Excellency respecting Angaum, I applied directly to the King, and His Majesty having granted his sanction on the 30th of March, I signed the Convention on the 2nd of April.' 43. The ratified Convention, communicated by telegram, is as follows :— ' A rticle I. &lt;c In order to provide against any accident to the Persian Gulf Cahle^ it is agreed that the British Government shall make arrangements in regard to the construction and efficient working of a line of Telegraph letween Gwadar and a point between Jask and Bunder Alias. ' A rticle II. The Persian Government will employ her good offices and authority for facilitating its construction, maintenance, and protection ; and the English Government will pay annually to the Persian Government the sum of BfiOO Tomans for leave to lay down a line of Telegraph on those parts of Coasts and places which are wider the Sovereignty of Persia, the payment of the ahove sum leing made from the day upon which the work of laying the wire is commenced. ' A rticle III. The present Convention to remain in force for twenty years,' 339 CHAPTER V. Captain Ross's Reports about Mekran, 1865-68. 44. Captain Ross had been appointed Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur on completion of the land Telegraph between Karachi and that port in April 1863. Long residence and association had enabled that officer to furnish much valuable information on the politics of the Mekran Coast and neighbourhood. In 1865, he submitted an interesting memorandum cf notes on Mekran which . . T 1D , a ,, tqotok is printed in the Journal of the Bombay Political A, January 1866, Nos. 132-135. r 7 • 7 ry • , -vt i vttttt Geographical Society, Volume AViil. In January 1866 Captain Eoss submitted a report on the trade and revenue of Gwadur printed as appendix to the Precis. On the 20th April 1867 Captain Ross writes :— 'On a range o£ low hills nortli of Sudaich there is a pile o£ stones which goes by the _ . | _ i £ niT i ^ t i name of ' Malek Chedar/ or Malek's boundary. toG»Su° This, native tradition asserts, was raised by an Politicl Divisions. independent Prince or Malek of Mekran to mark the limit or his kingdom. ISussir Khan of Kelat extended his sway to this point, it is said. A line from this pillar to Sudaieh, or the Sudaich river, will about describe the boundary o£ the Biaban on the one side, and the territory under Mir Abdullah on the other. et Mir Abdullah, the Chief of Geh, is invested by the Persian authorities with power to collect tribute on their behalf. He exercises authoritv directly over the tract between the Biaban and Charbar, and indirectly over that between Charbar and the Khan of Kelat^a boundary. He is himself of Gitchki descent, and connected with the Boiaidi family, the former Chiefs. He is excessively unpopular on account of the heaviness of his exactions of tribute; but probably he has no choice, being the servant of others. ' There are no local Chiefs of consequence residing- near the sea coast between Jask and Charbar. 'Charbar, as is well known, belongs to the Sultan of Muscat, on whose part a Wali is resident. ' A few miles east of Charbar the territory directly ruled by the Judgal Chiefs is entered* The head of the family is Din Mahomed, who resides in Dustyari, and rules the western half. Mahomed Ali, his cousin, has Baho for his share. Both are controlled by Mir Abdullah, and pay tribute to Persia. I have had opportunities of making acquaintance with both of them. At Baho Kelat resides Yar Mahomed, Chief of the Hotes, in this district: he holds out against payment of tribute to Persia. At Nigor and other places there are minor Chiefs of the Judgal family. ' The boundary of the Baho district is a few miles west of Drabol Hill, about the centre of Gwettur Bay. To the east of that is the Dusht district, which is under Kej. ,; 45. Again, in a later and more comprehensive Report,* addressed to the l 8 6 8&lt; Commissioner in Sind, there is much Forwarded to Government of Bombay in Jnly useful matter On the districts of the 1868. Perso-Beluch frontier :— ' Baho and Dustyari. —The boundary between Dusht and Baho, on the coast, is about the centre of Gwettur Bay, near the hill, named Drabol j and here terminates the Khan of Kelat's dominion. Thence to Charbar intervene the Districts Baho and Dustyari, which are usually coupled together. These districts are now under the immediate government of the Judgal Chiefs, Din Mahomed and Mahomed Ali, who, however, make their bow to Mir Abdullah Khan, who receives the surplus revenue for Persia, and exercises general control. The amount is not a fixed sum, but averages about Rupees 5,000 for both districts. The latter are considered rich ; camels are plentiful, and there is more than the average of cultivated land. Kibleh. —Is a term applied to the tract of country between Charbar and the territory farmed by Muscat, and is expressive of the westerly situation of the district, with reference to the rest of Mekran. This tract forms portion of the Geh District, which is the estate of Mir Abdullah Khan. tc Kej. — Kej, as a division, properly comprises several districts that have been treated separately, such as Dusht, Kolanch, etc. It is taken now in its less extensive sense, as applied to a town or cluster of forts and villages. Originally this town, if it may be termed so, was * Piinted at the Education Society's Press, Byculla, in 1868.40 ■X^'T {fif '» X a place of some importance, the capital of Mekran, and seat of Government. The Naib of the Khan of Kelat at present resides at Toorbut. ' Toomp. —Toomp and Nussirabad are clusters of forts and villages closely resembling Kej, and situated further west in the same valley. Toomp is about 30 miles distant from Kej, and with it are included Nussirabad and Ni^or. The Gitchkis are here the local Chiefs, the principal of whom in Toomp is Mir Morad. Toomp is the last of the towns in this valley under the Khan of Kelat. The next on west side is— (l Mund. —A settlement of Kinds, who profess to be independent of the Khan on the one side, and Persia on the other. Chief in Mekran, Kadirdad. ' Pishin. — Further West is Pisbin, which is under Persian influence. Little information has been acquired reg'arding this district. A tribe called Burrees reside here, of Omanee descent. The Chiefs are Bolaidis. Sirhaz. —Is also under Chiefs who are tributary to the Persian Government. Its present Chief is Hussain Khan Nharui. Its position is not well ascertained/' 46, Captain Ross considered that the political connection of Mekran 'with Upper Baluchistan took place in modern times. Before that, it was either an independent State, governed by its own hereditary Princes, or a Province^ the Persian Empire. The probability is, that it held each of these positions in turn; being in early times a province of the great Persian Kingdom, and acquiring a fleeting independence when that Empire was convulsed. The traditions of the natives point to such an early connexion with Persia. There is also reason to believe that Mekran shared the fate of the Central Provinces of Persia, and became annexed to the Great Mahomedan Empire in the first century of its supremacy.' He shows the early rulers to have been called C£ Maliks,' and these Maliks to have been superseded by the Bolaidis. The latter were, on the other hand, overthrown by the Gitchkis, of whom a noted Chief, named Dinar, subdued by Nadir Shah, or his generals, consented to hold Kej as a vassal of the Persian monarch. Quoting as his authority the work known by the name of Tarikh-i-Nadiri, Captain Eoss adds— ' Previously to this event (in 1734) the Governors of Kerman and Seistan had been Tarikh Nadiree. sen ^ ^ Nadir against the fort of Dizzuk, which . was reduced, and the inhabitants punished. Opeiations were also undertaken in other parts of Beluchistan. A Chief of Kharan, named aoordil Khan, a renowned free hooter, having violated the Persian frontier, Nadir sent troops Pgainst Kharan, and 700 of the Beluchis were slain. During 1 an expedition against Jask, a Persian force was, however, nearly wholly lost in the wild wastes of northern Mekran. In the year 17-36, the Amirs Mohbut Khan and Iltiaz Khan, brothers of the afterwards celebrated Nussir Khan, presented themselves at the Court of Nadir, and were kindly received. Iho elder, Mohbut Khan, was confirmed afresh in the Government of Beluchistan. Thus all Beluchistan and Mekran at this period were forced to pay homage to the Persian conqueror. Henceforward the history of Mekran is inseparably connected with that of the Kelat State.' 47. The history then shows Mohbut Khan released from Persia, and reduced to become the vassal of Ahmed Shah of Candahar; and further, Malik Dinar, of Kej, killed, and his sDn, Shah Omar, subdued by Nussir Khan, the distinguished successor of Mohbut: The army of Kelat marched through Mekran as far as Kusserkuud and Dizzuk. The attei piovinces were not permanently retained, and eventually were re^occupied by Persia, unjgur and Kolwah were attached to the Upper Provinces, and Mekran begun to assume the political aspect it exhibits at the present time. best seaports of Mekran have been lost to the Beluchis, as will be described. The principal of these, Gwadur, was acquired by Muscat, according to the most trustworthy accounts, in the following manner During the reign of the Imam Saeed-bin-Ahmed at Muscat, his younger brother Gwadur.

The sea-port of Charbar also fell into tnl m the time of the same Charbar.

It has since remained in the hands of the Arabs.' 48. The remaining extracts from this Report had special interest, as bearing more directly upon the recent development of affairs:— a On the death of Nussir Khan, the Gitchkis took advantage of troubles at Kelat to revolt and shike off the Kelat yoke. They were again reduced to obedience by Mehrab Khan in 1831, since when no serious disturbances have occurred affecting the K-han's supremacy. This is in great measure to be attributed to the tact and energy of the present Naib, Mir Faquir Mahomed, who has allied himself by marriage with the Gitchki family, and acquired undivided power in the province. Faqu'r Mahomed has had struggles with Azad /Khan of Kharan, and with the Hote tribe at Toomp, On one occasion, upwards o£ 15 years ago, he advanced with a force of 8,000 men against Gwadur, and succeeded in levying a sum in ransom. Shah Kasim, a Gitchki Chief, had several years before made a similar attack, ' Whilst Eastern Mekran was thus being brought under the sway of Kelat, the western Persiaa Districts divisions were falling to the share of Persia, A Persian Governor was established at Bampur, and later, Geh, Kusserkund, Dizzuk, Shirbaz, Baho, etc., were forced to pay tribute to the Persian representative. In accordance with the customary policy, neither Persian officers nor Persian troops were placed in charge of these districts. So long as their own Chiefs satis fied the demands of Persia, they were left unmolested. The districts of Geh, Kusserkund and Baho, Dustyari, are under the charge of a Gitchki Chief, named Mir Abdullah, who is Naib on the part of Persia, and acts under the orders of Ibrahim Khan, the Persian Gov ernor at Bampnr, who, in his turn, is subordinate to the Wukil-ul-Mulk of Kerman. Subor dinate to Mir Abdulla are the Judgal Chiefs of Baho and Dustyari, Mahomed Ali and Din Mahomed. The remaining Persian districts are also governed by Beluch Chiefs, who render account of the revenue to Ibrahim Khan. ' It has been seen that the eastern half of Mekran has fallen to the share of the Kelat Government State, and now forms part of what may be termed f Independent Beluchistan/ The west ern half is more or less directly subject to Persian sway. The Kej division is at the present day under the general supervision of Faquir Mahomed, the Khan's Naib, and Punjgur under that of Mir Esa, a bitchki Chief. These Chiefs, however, interfere but little with the administration of justice, etc., in the various subordinate districts, where the local Chiefs exercise unlimited power within their respective limits. laws, as we understand them, there are none^ and order is only enforced by the most primitive and summary means, and there is but little formal protection for life and property. The system of blood feuds has for ages been in force, and, for want of a more regular appeal to justice, exercises a wholesome influence. ^ The Naib, resident at Kej, is held responsible by the Khan for the collection of TJpvpnnps revenue. As has been mentioned one-half is allowed to the Gitchki family. In Kej, Toomp, and Nussirabad, where the Gitchki Chiefs reside, they themselves collect the revenues of their estates, and pay over the proper share to the Naib. In the other districts the revenue is collected by the head men and made over to Faquir Mahomed, who pays the Gitchki Chief, Mir Bayan, his allotted share. The system observed of imposing the taxes is as bad as could be. The agriculturists bear the burden almost alone, and of these the poorer only, the rich and powerful being usually exempted. One-tenth of the produce of the fields and groves is the property of the State, added to which is a tax on inheritances. These, with exception of occasional fines, are the only sources from which the State derives revenue. Trade and manufactures escape free. The land tax would, no doubt, produce a considerable income, were it not that whole classes have been exempted by grants from its infliction, and these the wealthiest of the people. In Kej it is estimated that four-fifths of the land property is owned by Gitchkis, Sungors, and others, claiming absolute immunity from all taxation. Under these circumstances, the amount of income actually realized is ridiculously small compared to the produce of the country. From the Kej province, after payment of expenses, the balance sent to the Khan's Treasury seldom exceeds Rupees 10,000 annually. 'From Punjgur it is believed he receives about Rupees 20,000. ' In the Persian Districts much the same system prevails. The amount paid by the Judgal Chiefs of Baho and Dustyari is above Rupees 5,000 annually to Mir Abdullah. When the people cannot or will not pay the tenths, a force is collected, which ravages the refractory districts,' 4626 F. D.41 ' The sea-port of Charbar also fell into th Charbar.

Unsettled state of the Country. 49. The Chief Director of the Government, Indo-European Telegraph, having submitted his proposals for extending and strengthening the lines, consequent upon Mr. Alison's Treaty, the Secretary of State for India in formed the Government of Bombay of his general concurrence in the views expressed, and of the nature of authority conveyed for further proceedings. Sir Stafford Northcote's letter thus alludes to the political arrangements involved:— ' la the latter part of his memorandum, Colonel Goldsmid proposes to superintend T . „personally towards the end of the year, the settle- No. 4 ot the 7th May 1868. ^ ^ wjth the 3^^ and otl]er a|ong the Mekran Coast of the terms of the subsidies to be allowed them on account of their acqui escence in our arrangements. He has been apprised that in any doubtful or difficult questions which may occur during discussion of these matters, he must apply for instructions to your Goverument. ,; 50. Before, however, putting briefly on record the progress and comple tion of the negotiations here contemplated, it will be necessary to show the actual condition of the country at the time. There had been signs of disquiet again since Ibrahim Khan's encroachments of frontier in 1863; and the advance upon Punjgur in 1864, mentioned in Captain Watson's Report. 51. The Assistant Political Agent writes in August last:—' It has been Captain Ross, to Sir W. Merewether, No. 106, reported to me On STOod authority that of 24th August 1868. the Persian authorities on the Frontier of Beluchistan have some intention of sending an expedition into the territory of the Khan of Kelat under the following circumstances :— ' A few years ago a dispute arose between the Naib of Kej and Shai Omar, of the Gitchki family. The latter having been driven out of the Fort of Toorbut, proceeded to Kelat, to complain to the Khan. A nephew of Shai Omar, named Mahomed Khan, soon after abandoned his estate in Ke], proceeded, to the Persian districts with all his family, and has since been endeavouring to procure assistance against Faquir Mahomed in that quarter. This year Mahomed Khan accompanied Ibrahim Khan, Governor of Bampur, to Kerman, to seek assistance of the Wakil-ul-Mulk, and returned to Geh a short time ago. ' The Persian Deputy at Geh, Mir Abdullah, wrote in the present month to Mahomed AH, Chief of Baho, informing him that the Kerman Ruler had promised to send 8,000 men with Mahomed Khan, to enable him to push his claims at Kej. ' I do not record this Report under the impression that it is in the least probable such a design will be carried into execution. Violations of frontier have, however, not been unfrequent from the side of Persian Baluchistan, and you are well aware of the nature of Persia's policy in this quarter during the past twenty years. It appears to me the time is at hand when such occurrences must, as far as possible, be discouraged. The Persian authorities of these remote districts have not yet quite realized the fact that their proceedings can no longer escape unnoticed. I, therefore, think it well to be particular in noticing for your information, and that of the Political Agent at Kelat, all such reports as the present, which seem to have some foundation. That there is some foundation for the present report can scarcely be doubted, since it reached me from three separate quarters. ' I would respectfully suggest that the mere fact of an enquiry being made of the Kermao Governor would have a significance which might be beneficial/ , 52. In a letter shortly afterwards despatched to Government by the Com missioner in Sind—Sir W. Merewether, No. 393 of nth September 1868. alluding to the State of Kelat, thus expresses himself:— There is, however, another reason why it is most expedient that every means should be adopted now to strengthen this little State as a friendly outwork, and that nothing should be ventured on that which might weaken it or turn it from us, apart from the disturbed state of Af^hanibtan and the important events which have lately occurred in Central Asia, all maters or the greatest consideration. There is a menace nearer to our doors which may ca for immediate notice, and in the meeting of which the position and value of the Kelat Khanate will have a very important bearing.43 ' Sir Henry Green reported some time back the entrance of the Persian force into Seistan, and its establishment there. Lately I had the honour of forwarding a letter from Vide supra. Captain RosSj Assistant Political Agent, Mekran. ******** 'I have since received a further communication, * * forwarding; extract from a letter from Sirdar Faquir Mahomed, of Kej, to the following effect;— '' When I came to Parood a letter was received from the Padshaie (Persian authorities) to furnish 2,000 sheep and 2,000 maunds of ghee for rations for Bampar, as 8,000 troops and eight guns are coming against Kej. A letter was also written to Sirdar Mir Hossain Khan, that the army will come by the Sirbaz route ; and to keep the road clear of his men.' It is possible that nothing is immediately intended in this; that it is only a feeler put out to see how such action would be received and noticed. But it shows pretty clearly that there'is a tendency on the part of Persia to attempt to advance its frontier eastwards, which it is necessary to provide against in every possible way. Copies of Captain Ross's communication have been forwarded to Colonel Pelly at Bushire, and to Colonel Phayre at Jacobabad, for information, and for any further intelligence on the subject they may be able to obtain. Their replies will be forwarded hereafter. It remains now to consider whether anything can be done to improve the position of the Khan of Kelat.' 53. Some weeks later in the same year Captain Ross again addresses the No. 133 of I2tli October. Commissioner in Sind :— ' The result of my late enquiries is, that the fact of the Bampur Governor, or Serheng, having expressed in letters to Mir Abdullah of Geh his intention of proceeding against Kej is confirmed beyond doubt. Two letters were received from Kerman by Mir Abdullah to that effect. No actual movement of troops has occurred, nor has Ibrahim Kbau himself returned from Bampur. ' Mir Abdullah has just been ordered by Ibrahim Khan to collect the revenue of his districts, and repair with it to Bampur to meet Ibrahim Khan. 'The Gitchki Chief, Mir Bayan, of Kej, recently visited Mir Abdullah for the purpose of speaking to him about the rumoured expedition ; and, I am informed, requested Mir Abdullah to oppose the project. 'The Chief of Dustyari, with whom I am well acquainted, and who is a reliable person, has promised to forward me intelligence, should any further steps be taken by the Persians. ' There is reason to hope that the design, if at first sincerely conceived, will not now be proceeded with. ,J 54. On a reference being made to Teheran, in consequence of Captain Mr. Alison, to the Viceroy, 2iBt November Ross's Reports, Her Majesty's Minister 1868. forwarded a Statement addressed to him self by Mr, Thomson :— ' I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that rumours had reached the Khan of Kelat's officers, which led tbem to apprehend that the Governor of Kerman intended sending a military force into a portion of the Kelat territory; and I enquired of His Excellency if there was any foundation for these reports ? He replied that it was usual for the Governor of Kerman to assemble a small force on the frontiers of Beluchistan from time to time, in order to maintain his authority in that quarter, and that he had heard of the recent departure of the Governor from Kerman with this object; but he was not aware that it was his intention to proceed beyond Bampur with the force under his command. The Kerman Governor's Reports, however, he said, were forwarded to the Mustofi-ul-Memalik's department, and he would make enquiries there, and ascertain what information had lately been received from that province; but he thought that, in a case of this sort, the Khan of Kelat, who had the means of doing so, if he chose, would have done well to have addressed himself to the Governor of Kerman directly for any explanations he might require on this subject/' 55. At the commencement of November, the Chief Director of the Indo- European Telegraph arrived in Bombay from England, and proceeded soon after, in accordance with instructions, accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent, to Gwadur, and other parts of the Mekran Coast, to prepare the way for intended arrangements with the local Chiefs, But the then recent death of Mir Abdullah, by far the most notable of these, and the delay in nomination of a successor, rendered it necessary to defer for a time actual negotiations. No. 225 of 7th December 1868 to Secretary, Eieutenant-Colonel Goldsmid forwarded, Bombay Government. however, his proposal for further pro- 1869. ceedings; and on his return to Mekran Eesolution No. 400,5tb February 1869. early in Eebruary, received the instruc tions of the Government of Bombay to ' deal with the Chiefs, west of Kelat territory, as he should find most advisable when on the spot,'*u 56. In explanation of the discretional power thus given, it may be stated that in January of this year Ibrahim Khan of Bam pur had once more appeared on the scene, addressing himself to Captain Boss in an objectionable strain, to the effect that he had heard of the projected extension of the Tele graph from Gwadur westward, but had received no authority from his Govern ment to allow the work to proceed. The Chiefs of Baho had expressed them selves alarmed at the threats of a new Persian invasion; and, however willing to assist us in guarding our Telegraph, they dared not negotiate, unless under sanction of Persia. Not long afterwards, Ibrahim Khan intimated that he had received a copy of the short Anglo-Persian Convention of 1868, addressed Captain Ross in a friendly and courteous manner; and the Baho Chiefs were at liberty to treat with us, as before intended. But this state of affairs, however, improved in one sense, was not without its difficulties. The Governor of Bampur had received the orders of his Government to aid us : he must come down to the Coast: he must personally ascertain that we have got all that we require, and his coming must be the coming of a large body of armed men. 57. The following extract will show how the negotiations with the local Chiefs were effected under the circumstances :— 'Under the instructions, and with the discretionary power given, I have been able to Chief Director, Indo-European Telegraph, to negotiate the whole question of subsidy to local Government o£ Bombay, No. 90 of Stb March Chiefs as originally intended ; and Ibrahim Khan, of Bampur, has not been named, nor has the Persian Government authority been quoted in any one of the agreements concluded on account of protection to the Telegraph from Gwadur to Jask. ' First appearances were against such a conclusion. Letters from Ibrahim Khan and his deputy came in to Captain Ross before we left Gwadur. An interview was proposed, and Baho named as the place of meeting. The reports of the Persian advance on Baho caused such distress and confusion that I wrote twice to the Bampur Chief, assuring him that his presence was superfluous, so far as we were concerned, and that his coming disturbed the peace of the inhabitants. It should be explained that c Baho' is a district, the head-quarters being called Baho Kelat. u Captain Ross and I proceeded from Charbar by land. Had Ibrahim Khan come down to Baho on the date fixed, he might easily have met us, for we passed through the Baho country, and were seven days on the road, although the distance is estimated at only 110 miles. But there was a lull in the prevailing excitement. Ibrahim Khan's Agent, who had been sent in advance to extract money from the Baho Chiefs, had returned to his master at Sirbaz, several marches to the northward ; and the two Chiefs had taken the opportunity to come and meet us, unaccompanied by Persian officers. When we arrived at Charbar, however a Persian Envoy awaited us. He had brought a letter from Ibrahim Khan to Captain Ross in reply to a communication forwarded by that officer some days before my arrival at Gwadur. The language was very civil; but the writer said he must come down to Charbar. Captain Ross replied much in the sense o£ my former letters, explaining further to the Envoy how needless it would be to take the proposed trouble. We left Charbar by steamer for Jask ; but before leaving I despatched a letter to the Chief of Geh, the 'large district between Charbar and Jask territory, stating my intention of returning in a few days with the view of meeting and conferring with him. '' were away ten days, during which time I visited the Island of Henjam, and com pleted. the negotiations at Jask, where Captain Ross had smoothed the way by intelligent and judicious preliminaries. On return to Charbar I found the Chief, for whom I had written, was awaiting us with his W uzir; and here again our negotiations were briefly and quite satisfactorily concluded. Ihus was the whole affair on which I had been deputed brought to a close. Ihere were a few details to attend to comparatively unimportant/ , 58. Ibrahim Khan, however, did not rest satisfied here. The letter above quoted proceeds to state :— iru on ^ ie occas io n of this last visifc to Charbar, fresh reports were rife on Ibrahim rrurf ° fl0V^ ®® Q ® n J :s • He was reported to have left Sirbaz and come down to Baho Kelat. Ihe Baho Chiefs and inhabitants had fled, it was said, to the hills. The whole country was again in commotion. Three thousand soldiers and guns seemed an absurd exaggeration jut it was probable that the story of the downward march had some truth in it. rt, v. r ^ urne( ^ ^wadur by sea. At Gwadur much the same reporls were about as at . a y :)ar - Alter a time rumour assumed a different complexion. Ibrahim Khan was not com ing to Charbar immediately, if at all. Nor had he reached Baho Kelat. He had stopped in resning, and was demanding tribute from Toomp. \^ V i'^ nC ^r» av0 - Ur ex P laiu ' ae c,earl y as possible, the position. Accepting the boundary up o ^nica the Persians have hitherto encroached with successful result, or rather within45 which they levy periodical tribute, we have districts on or contiguous to the frontier^ and more or less important, as follows :— Persian. Jalk. Djzzuk. Sirbaz. Peshing or Peshin. Baho. Kelat. Punjgur. Kej. Toomp. Nnssirabad. Mund, professedly independent. Now it is quite clear that Toomp is wholly out of the hitherto acknowledged line of encroach ment. It is a step beyond, and a step which affects our ally the Khan of Kelat. The Chief of Toomp is the Khan^s vassal. ' It is possible the report may be false, but I can well understand that Ibrahim Khan should either make the Shah's mandate to assist us in constructing the Coast Telegraph a pretext to come down and attempt new encroachments on behalf of his King; or that, having failed in his endeavour to act in concert with us (in other words, to share the likely profits we may hold out), while dealing with the local Chiefs, he should wish to milise the toil and labour of a long and difficult march with men and guns in the most advantageous manner. ' The story continues that the Chief of Toomp, on receiving the demand for tribute, consulted Faquir Mahomed, Naib of Kej, who advised resistance, promised aid, and has himself proceeded with a considerable body of men to the quarter threatened. Further, that Mahomed Khan, a Chief of the Gitchki tribe, who has a claim against the Naib of Kej, is in Ibrahim Khan's Camp. Mir Morad, Chief of Toomp, is moreover a Gitchki.' 59. About this time was received in India a second despatch from Her Majesty's Minister in Persia, conveying the further reply of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs respecting the recent alleged intentions before noted, of the Shah's Government to despatch a force into the Eelat territory : 'I have been assured by His Excellency, after he had communicated with the King's mr ai ;»« *■ 4 -v tt * -. q ,, t lam Chief Minister, the Mustofi-ul-Memalik, that the Mr. Alison, to the Viceroy, 18th January 1869. • j . i.- i i- Persian Government had no intention or making any movement against the Khan of Kelat, but that the Governor of Kerman had been authorised, as in former years, either to despatch a small force, or to proceed himself in the direction of Charbar and the Gwadur territory, in order to maintain the Shah's authority in these parts, which were, as had been often explained during the negotiations last spring for the Mekran Coast Line of Telegraph, considered to form part of the Persian dominions.' 60. The Commissioner in Sind, drawing attention to this despatch, would To His Excellency the Eight Hoocurable the ' P oint 0ut tha . t . if this is to . be accepted Governor of Bombay, No. 1866, of 23rd March as a clear definition of Persian territorial 1869 * rights, any part of Mekran may equally be said, when it suits the purpose of that Government, to be considered to form part of the Persian dominions.' He further alludes to the claim made by Ibrahim Khan to Toomp, within thirty miles of Kej, and in the same valley, adding that the same Chief last summer ' threw out hints of his inten tion to visit Kej, and directed Kazim Mahomed * * to lay in supplies for the coming Persian troops.' Sir W. Merewether had ' requested the Political Superintendent of the Frontier of Upper Sind to address His Highness the Khan, with a view to his strengthening the hands of his Governor of Mekran, Faquir Mahomed, the Naib of Kejbut he represents the Khan's position a difficult one, and he, the Khan, &lt;c naturally will feel it very hard that his difficulties should now be much increased by the action of a power said to be in alliance with the British Government, whose ally the Khan also is.' The Commissioner mentions a further report from Captain Ross, that Ibrahim Khan talked of tl going to Kharan, on the W. N. W. boundary of Kelatand concludes by earnestly recommending that early steps may be taken to check the Persian proceedings, and, if possible, arrive at a clear understanding ' as to which is the proper boundary of Persia to the eastward.' 61. With a later letter Sir W. Merewether forwards Captain E/Oss'a No, 186 Of 7th April 1869. reports, confirmatory of Ibrahim Khan's claims on Toomp. He states: ' I cannot express too strongly my opinion of the mischief which must follow proceed ings such as those of Sirheng Ibrahim Khan. Not only is he most unjustifiably infringing 4626 F. D.46 the boundary of our ally, His Highness the Khan of Khelat, but he is disordering the whole country by moving here and there, and assuming power of interference and control to which neither he, nor the Government he pretends to represent, has the slightest claim. Amono-st uie correspondence forwarded are two letters in original, * * * to Mir Mo^al (jitchki, m the first of which Ibrahim Khan lays claims to Toomp as being within Persian territorial limits. This is most unwarrantable. Toomp is in the same valley as Kedi, and he might just as well lay claim to the one as the other. * * ' statements with regard to his actions being in accord with an understandinff between the British and Persian Governments are likely to do exceeding harm, unless they are retuted in a clear and unmistakeable manner, such as will be readily understood by tha simple wild people of Mekran. * * * J J I would beg prominently to bring to Your Excellency's notice the admirable and truly f^u ,CO rr- u Sirdar Faquir Mahomed. * * I am causing a statement to be made of it . 18 ® lness p ^ an &gt; through Colonel Phayre, Political Supeiintendent of the frontier, i expression of entire satisfaction at the Naib^s prompt and bold conduct.' * * * a Gover ? or of Bampur came down to Charbar about the 1st Apnl 1869, accompanied by a body of cavalry, variously estimated at one and two hundred. He did not stay there long. Ibrahim Khan returned to Kus- surkund from Charbar on 27tli April leaving no troops behind. Aprif 1869 Tlie neW ^ 0f Tele » ^a I )h, west of Gwa(i ur, was completed in In 1869 engagements were made with the Chiefs of Bahu, Dashtyari, Geh, and Jask for the protection of the Telegraph. In their agreement (No. CLXXXV, Aitcmsons Treaties, Volume IX—Baluchistan), the Chiefs of Bahu andDash- T'. Mahomed and Mahomed Ali, in consideration of the annual sum of i n paid in e( l ual shares to each of them, pledged themselves to attord all security and protection in their power to the line of Telegraph about to be constructed by the British Government from the boundary of the Kedi erntory up to Charbar, to assist in every way the officers and employes of the elegraph, and to place at the disposal of the Telegraph Officers, whenever required, at least four sowars at Rs. 20 each per month, payable by the Officers. ne agreement was to come into immediate effect, payment of subsidy beinJ made half-yearly by Captain Ross or other British officers stationed at Gwadur, ie nrst instalment being calculated from 1st January 1869. 63A. The agreement with ohiefdom of Geh was made with Shah Nasrut&gt; represeutatiTe of the widow of the late Mir Abdullah Khan, who pledged, in T J 0 fu an ^ annUal subsid y of Rs. 3,000, to protect the line from onarbar to Sadeiah, the payment was to be made half-yearly by the same *r„ C rT . and Dashtyari. (Aitohison's Treaties, Vol. IX, ■no. LLAAAVI, Baluchistan.) 62 ^ Arrangements were made also with the two chiefs of Jask who were to be paid Es. 30 and 40 for their trouble.47 CHAPTER YlV Perso-Rhelat boundary dispute settled by a Commission. (i) Persian agreement to demarcate the boundary line by a mixed Commission. We have seen above how the Persian encroachments and pretensions on Mekran created a state of confusion, from which the question of telegraph extension to Jask was extricated by a Convention with Persia which avoided defining the limits of the Persian sovereignty. But the question of defining the limits of Persian territory in Baluchistan could not be indefinitely postponed without allowing the Persian authorities to make further encroachments, and we were bound by Treaty engagements to maintain the integrity of the Khelat State. 64. Mr. Thomson's despatches to Lord Clarendon of 21th December 1869, 8th and 15th February 1870, shewed that on receipt of each fresh item of intelligence from India, regarding a rumoured advance on the Khan^s districts in Mekran, he impressed on the Persian Government the necessity of restrain ing hostile aggression. The Governor of Kerman had certainly gone to the frontier districts with a force, but that force, Mr. Thomson was assured, was intended only for service within the Persian border. He would, however, the Persian Minister promised Mr. Thomson, receive fresh orders to be more circumspect and to avoid holding out threats which he was not at present authorized to enforce. 65. By the middle of February he received from Lord Clarendon a des patch, the draft of which had been approved by the India Office in January, stating in more peremptory terms than had hitherto been used, that the British Government, having Treaty engagements with Khelat, could not be indifferent to any intentions on the part of Persia which caused apprehensions to the Khan. He wrote, therefore, to Mirza Said Khan, again drawing attention to the renewed intelligence from India, that the movement of troops to the Mekran frontier by the Governor of Kerman and Ibrahim Khan, had caused excitement and disturbances in districts along the British frontier, and impressed on the Minister the expediency of peremptorily forbidding either open aggression or threats on the part of the Persian frontier authorities. Mirza Said Khan replied by asking Mr. Thomson whether this demand was based on any particular Convention, or was asked as a friendly favour, or was an imperative demand. Mr. Thomson rejoined by showing that, in spite of repeated protestations, the Shah had not authorized aggression in Mekran ; that the threat of aggres sion did not cease to impend over the Khan's vassals there; that the British Government could not look with indifference on the apprehensions of a State with which it had Treaty engagements; that, therefore, the Persian Govern ment was requested to issue stringent orders to prevent unauthorized move ments by the local functionaries. 66. The Shah then (14th April 1870) wrote an autograph letter to the following effect :— Respecting Khelat, the demarcation of boundaries between Persia, Beloochistan and Khelat has not yet been clearly defined. If the British Government is desirous that the said line of frontier be traced, let Commissioners be sent by the three parties to the frontier, that is to say, by England, Persia, and Khelat, and let them settle the boundary line, otherwise, if the frontier is not defined, these difficulties will be daily recurring. * This chapter is taken from a precis by Mr. Wynne on the demarcation of the Perso-Khelat Boundary in Mekran.48 67. On receipt of tlie despatch (No. 39, dated 15th April), announcing this decision. Lord Clarendon communicated with the India Office, and the Secretary of Stat^ for India (3rd June) expressed his opinion in favour of the proposal, and remarking that Colonel Goldsmid might be employed as British Commissioner either before or after the Seistan arbitration. Lord Clarendon thereupon requested Mr. Alison (who had now returned to Teheran) to inform the Persian Government that— ' Her Majesty's Government have had under their consideration Mr. Thomson's despatch No. 39 of 15th April last, respecting the proposal of the Shah that Commissioners should be named by England, Persia, and Khelat to proceed to the Mekran frontier, for the purpose of settling the bouudaiy line between the two countries , and that Her Majesty's Government, being desirous of meeting the wishes of the Shah, are willing to agree Co His Majesty's pro posal, and Colonel Goldsmid, who has been selected to act as Commissioner on the part of Great Britain, will be directed to proceed to the Mekran frontier either before or after the settlement of the Seistan arbitration.' These papers were communicated to the Government of India in the Duke of Argyll's despatch No. 57, dated 15th July 1870. On the 23rd July, Mr. Alison submitted this communication to the Shah at an audience. On the 24th he received a memorandum from the Persian Government, setting forth— ' that the British and Persian Commissioners were to proceed and draw up a map of Persia's possessions and those of the Khan of Khelat in Beloochistan with their boundaries, and bring the same with them to Teheran.' Seeing that this would be no settlement of the boundary, as proposed in the King's autograph letter, Mr. Alison, on 25th July, asked for explanation. • From Mirza Sa.ed Khan, dated 2nd Angcst. Th0 answer • he received was the follow ing iC The concluding paragraph of the memorandum of the English Legation, dated the 25th of July, expressing the wish to receive some explanation of the King's autograph, dated the 14th of April, has been understood and shown to His Majesty. In reality this passage in the memorandum of this Ministry, dated the 24th of July— c The said Commissioners will be at liberty to proceed from thence (Seistan) and draw up a map of Persia's possessions in Beloochistan and those of the Khan of Khelat with their boundaries, and bring the same with themselves to Teheran. That question will be then justly decided with the knowledge of the British Government'—-completes and makes clear the passage in the Lastkhat of the 14th of April, that from Persia, England, and Khelat &lt; let Commissioners be sent and settle the boundary line.' The bringing the map to Teheran is with the same object in view, and in order to render complete the proposition of the Shah, and as the matter of Seistan is more important, in the memorandum of the 24th July it is thus stated :—' It is hereby agreed upon that the boundaries in Seistan are to be looked to first and before those of Beloochistan.' ' Mr. Alison reported this answer by his despatch to Lord Granville, No. 43, dated 17th August. 68. Owing to tbe unsettled state into which Yakoob Khan's rebellion had thrown the neighbouring parts of Afghanistan, the demarcation of the boundary in Seistan was for the time rendered impossible, and was necessarily deferred. Under these circumstances Major-General Goldsmid, with the sanction of the Secretary of State (conveyed in his telegram of the 27th October 1870), t Obtained with the utmost difficulty, for the and with the consent 'f of the Persian reason that the Persian case in Seistan was known Government (communicated to the GoV- to be as strong as it was weak in Mekran. a-ctt' i.i £ T%/r ernment of India in a telegram from Mr. Alison of the 27th November), proceeded to Mekran to undertake the adjust ment of the Perso-Baluch boundary. 69. When General Goldsmid started on his mission, the Secretary of State gave him detailed instructions with regard to the work in Seistan, and in paragraph 12 promised to send him instructions with regard to Mekran in a separate letter. On the 16th January, General Goldsmid having said he had not received the promised instructions, the Viceroy asked the Secretary of State by telegram whether they were on their way. On the 21st, the Secretary of State replied that it would rest with the Viceroy to issue instructions regarding the Mekran arbitration.70. Consequently, on the 24th January, instructions were issued to Cjreneral Goldsmid. By that time. Government had received copy of Mr. Alisons despatch No. 43, dated 17th August, sending Mirza Saeed's memorandum of 2nd August, saying— To Secretary of State, dated 25th January , ' Tllat meaning of the Shah in respect to the 1871, No. 1, paragraph 4. aemareation of the frontier was that the Anglo- . , , Persian Commissioner should prei)are a map on the spot for the subsequent settlement of the boundary line.'' In the instructions to General Goldsmid it therefore was impossible to tell him definitely whether the settlement to be effected by the Commissioner was or was not to be considered as final. Those instructions were conveyed in No. 169P., dated 24 1 th January 1871 and were as follows : — 'The Secretary of State has approved the suggestion that the boundary described in your memorandum of 28th April 1869, should form the basis of your operations, with such deviation a,e your personal inspection may show to be desirable. Presuming that you will strike the boundary somewhere in the neighbourhood o£ Jalk, the line proposed, if eventually adopted will reach the sea immediately to the west of the Draboll Hill in the centre of Gwuttur Bay' and will leave on the west Jalk, Dizzuk, Sirbaz, Peshin and Bahu ; and on the east Kohuk' Punjgoor, Ked], Toomp, Nusseerabad and Mund. The main object to be attained is the definition of the western boundary of Khelat and its dependencies of Kedj, &amp;c., bevond which it is not supposed that the Persians have valid claims. A very liberal view may, therefore be taken of Persian claims to the west of that line ; but deviations to the eastward should not be agreed to unless they rest on substantial grounds, such as Treaty possessions, the wishes of the local Chiefs, or obvious advantage. '' From northward the boundary shown in your memorandum is an imaginary linQ drawn across the desert to Seistan. In respect to any such line as you may suggest to your fellow Commissioners, great caution will be requisite. The point where the prolono-ation of the boundary joins the cultivated lands on the left bank of the Helmund, will naturally be the point from which the Seistan boundary will start. On this subject I enclose for your S. I. of 3870, Nos. 324-25. information copy of a despatch, No. 41, dated ^th. July 1870, addressed by the Government of India to the Secretary of State. If the dotted line shown on your map as the sucro-ested boundary be prolonged, it will strike the Helmund somewhere in the neighbourhood of Bu^gutser, or, at any rate, much further up the river than the highest point to which the Persian Government have any pretensions. Very great caution, therefore, must be exercised and if any desert line be suggested at all, it should be puch that the Seistan boundary may form the natural continuation of it. The most desirable course would be to leave the desert line undetermined till its other terminus on the Seistan side can be definitely settled. It can really be of^little importance which course the Hue takes between the termini; and probably a straight line will meet the wishes of all parties. On this point His Excellency in Council will be glad if you will submit your views in a special Beport. ^The Commission is a mixed one, consisting of yourself and the Commissioners from Persia and Khelat. Majors Harrison and Ross have no co-ordinate authority. Their dutv will be to submit to you all the information they possess or can acquire regarding the boundary and to assist you, generally, in such duties as you may see fit to entrust to them. When the three Commissioners are unanimous, the boundary will be defined in accordance with their opinion. ^Vhen they differ, the boundary will be laid down in accordance with the views of the majority. ' There appears to be some doubt whether, when the labours of the Commissioners are completed, their settlement is to be considered final, or whether they are to proceed to Teheran where the question of the boundary will be decided in communication with Her Majesty's Minister. On this point a further communication will be made to you after reference to the Secretary of State; it will probably reach you before the work of demarcation is completed ' 71. And in despatch No. 1 (Secret), dated 25th January, Government pointed out to the Secretary of State the discrepancy between Mirza Saeed's memorandum, and Lord Clarendon's instructions, founded on the Shah 's autograph of 28th April, and communicated with the despatch No. 57, dated 15th July 1870. And the Secretary of State was asked whether a reply had been sent to Mr. Alison's despatch of 17th August; and was told that it was in the opinion of the Government of India, essential that the question— which function the Commissioners should fulfil, should be settled before the work of demarcation was finished. 72. To this the Secretary of State replied on the 3rd March (No.l, Secret) saying that the same procedure should be adopted as that prescribed in paragraphs 12 and 13 of General Goldsmid's Seistan instructions, i e., that General Goldsmid, after coming to a decision, should communicate it to th©50 two Commissioners of Persia and Khelat, await on the frontier the reply to the reference which they would make to their GovernmeDts, try to remove their objections, and, if he failed, inform them (the Commissioners) that his task was at an end, and that he would report the matter to his own Gorern- ment. 73. This reply ignored entirely the Persian memoranda of 24th July and 2nd August. The Government of India, on the 4th of April, while communi- * To General Goidsmid, No. 700P., dated 4th eating the instructions of the Secretary April 1871, paragraph 5. of State,* told General Goidsmid :— f&lt; The instructions to furnish the Persian and Khelat Commissioners with a written statement of the decision, with the facts, and arguments on which it is based, must not however, be considered as absolute. His Excellency in Council leaves it to your discretion to show to their Commissioner any of your papers, or to withhold them as you may deem best. When your labours are concluded, you should repair to Teheran with all the informa tion that you have acquired, and there assist in effecting a final settlement in communication with Mr. Alison and the Indian and Home Governments.' This last order was in conformity with Mirza Saeed's memorandum of the 2nd August. These instructions were communicated to General Goidsmid by telegram of the 5th April. (11).-Proceedings of the Commissioners. 74 General Goidsmid, accompanied by the Persian Commissioner, Mir Maasum Khan, reached Bampur on the 28th January, and there learned of the approach of the Khelat Commissioner with Major Ross and Captain Harrison, and over 270 followers. He informed the Persian Commissioner, and proposed either to go forward to meet them before their arrival at Bampur or else that the meeting should take place on the other, the eastern, side of the frontier. The opinion of the Persian Commissioner, however, was that as they were so far on their journey, they should come on to Bampur. Nevertheless just before their arrival, he objected to their coming so far from the districts for investigation,' stating that— a the territory in Baluchistan, which is at present in possession of Persia, is not to come again under discussion according to the basis of the former agreement between the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Legation ; and that the English Government should only arbitrate on those places which Persia claims as her own.' Those places, he plainly stated, were Kedj-Mekran, to which he said that the Persian Minister's messenger to Mr. Ongley had expressly limited the enquiry. He also objected to any attempt to commence the demarcation of the frontier from its northern portion ? though believing that Commissioners had been appointed to discuss the whole frontier between Persia and Khelat, General Goidsmid then suggested that they should take for discussion the line of frontier from the southern limit of the districts adjoining Jalk as far as the sea ; but the Persian Commissioner expressed his inabiiicy, under his instructions, to accept this proposal. General Goidsmid also offered to discuss what might be considered— 'the Kedj-Mekran frontier, but on the understanding that, after the Persian claims had been preierred, any counter-claim from Khelat should be admitted hearing also.' This, too, was refused by the Persian Commissioner. In the meantime, as the presence of the Khelat Commissioner with his following, and the accompany ing British officers at Bampur was being construed into a source of complaint, they left after a stay of six days. It was altogether unfortunate that the Khelat Commissioner should have been accompanied by so large a retinue, even although the numbers did not exceed what is customary, for it gave opportunities to the Persian Commissioner of putting fresh difficulties in the way of an amicable adjustment of the boundary dispute. Government was not made aware beforehand of the number of the followers whom the Khelat Commissioner intended to take with him, and with a view to avoid anv possible cause of olience to Persia, it had already withheld sanction from a proposalL 51 th*it the party from Klielat ihould be attended by a detatchment of tbe Sind Horse. 75. Impressed with the necessity of obtaining some basis for dif-enssion General Goldsmid now proposed to open the confeience at Pesbin, which was admitted by Ibrahim Khan (the chief representative of Persian authority in these parts) to be his frontier post in the direction of Kedj. To this at first the Persian Commissioner signified his agreement; but, on General Goldsmid'a non-ae,ceptance of his condition that he should be escorted to the frontier bv Ibrahim Khjin with an armed force, he withdrew that consent, on the ground that the proper frontier of Persia's possession was beyond Peshin. la fine, the Persian Commissioner virtually demanded that the right of his Government to all that it asserted to be in its possession should be acknowledged ; that the discussion should be limited to the further territory which it claimed, and should be carried on in that territory in the presence of an armed force of Persians. 76. Seeing clearly that this attitude offered no opening for the discussion and settlement of the question. General Goldsmid determined to proceed to Gwadur on the lice of telegraphic communication with the Government of India and with Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran. He begged the latter to procure instructions that the Persian Commissioner should meet him at Gwadur for discussion, and, before leaving Bampur, was assured by the Persian Com missioner that, when duly instructed, he would come down and discuss the boundary on the data to be supplied by the of&amp;cers engaged in its survey, Captain Lovett and the Persian Surveyor. On the 18th March, however, he wrote asking why he should attend a Conference at Gwadur, and renewing the proposal to visit the frontier places {viz., Kedj) in compliance with the orders of his Government. 77. On the 23rd March, Mr. Alison telegraphed that instructions would be sent directing the Persian Commissioner to proceed to Gwadur, and (as it was afterwards explained) to inspect the frontier line. When he arrived, however, he not only refused to meet the Khelat Commissioner, or to listen to any of the Khelat evidence as to the possession of places on the frontier, but even said that his written instructions differed from the telegrams. This statement explains the fact that notwithstanding the assurances from Teheran that the Persian Commissioner had been directed, in conjunction with General Goldsmid, to ' visit the necessary places,'' to prepare a map and co-operate in a suitable manner with General Goldsmid, he refused to visit any place except Kedj. Indeed, he admitted to Captain Smith at Charbar that he had been only authorized by his Government to visit certain places which had been named to him. 78. Being informed by General Goldsmid that the Persian Commissioner was anxious to leave Gwadur, the Viceroy, on the 17th April, urged Her Majesty's Minister to press the Persian Government to desire him not to leave till the matter was settled. A similar application had been made to Mr. Alison by General Goldsmid. But, although Mr. Alison had, on the 21st, telegraphed that the Persian Government had by telegraph repeated the instructions to their Commissioner to visit the necessary places, and to collect information regarding their state and position, the Persian Commissioner insisted on leaving on the 24ith without carrying these instructions into effect, saying that he knew of no place necessary to be visited except Kedj, and that he had aleady procured all needful data regarding the other places at Teheran. Even Kedj he would not visit unless it was evacuated by all the Khelat soldiers before his visit, and unless he was accompanied by Ibrahim Khan, in whose persistent encroachments the boundary question originated. 79. Lastly it has here to be mentioned that the Persian Ministry had, on the strength of the allegations of the Persian Commissioners, laid betore Mr. Alison charges, the baseless character of which General Goldsmid clearly showed. The Government of India sent to the Secretary of State a strong expres sion of its opinion that these unfounded charges should be withdrawn by the Persian Government. The Secretary of State for foreign Affairs sent52 I instructions in this lense to Mr. Alison, who, on the 7th October 1871, replied that the Persian Foreign Office had sent to say— ' that the only object in communicating the charges was to make this mission cognizant of vi -kt mn * 3 tuxrojij reports in circulation: that the Persian Incloiura No. 27 in despatch No. 8, dated n i. i j . • j i • i , , r, 14th Jannarv 1872, from the Gov#rnment of government entertained a high reo-ard for General ludift, to the Seoretarj of State. Goldsmid; and that the memorandum of charges was to be withdrawn/' 80. The proceedings of the Persian CommissioDer, marked as they were by evasion, 'vacillation, and a total disregard of accuracy of statement, rendered it necessary that the Government of India should consider what course General Goldsmid should now take. Seeing that all the efforts of General Goldsmid to remove the objections of the Persian Commissioner failed of success, the Government of India might, under the circumstances, have directed him, in accordance with the instructions conveyed in the Duke of Argyll's Secret despatch No. 1, of Srd March 1871, to inform the Persian Commissioner, for communication to his Government, that his labors were at an end, and that it only remained for him (General Goldsmid) to communicate the results to his Government, and to await their farther instructions. But in view of the paramount importance of allowing no further delay to occur in the settlement of some definite boundary of the Persian possessions to the eastward, th* Government of India deemed it preferable that General Goldsmid should continue to collect all available information on the subject, and then proceed to Teheran for the adjustment of the question, in the manner which the Persian Government had themselves proposed. 81. Consequently, as General Goldsmid had completed the collection of the information bearing upon the present state of possession of Persia and Khelat in Mekran, as far as the means at his disposal admitted, he was bv No. 903 P., dated 16th May 1871, requested to proceed to Teheran as soon as possible; was given copies of the Shah's autograph letter of 14th April 1870 and of Mirza Saeed Ktian's memoranda of 2lth July and 2nd August and was desired to lay before Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran, the map prepared by Captain Lovett under his instructions, and the information he had collected with the object of enabling Mr. Alison to settle their eastern boundary ia accordance with the proposals made by the Persian Government in the above- mentioned documents. 82. In his letter No. 73, dated 1st April, General Goldsmid had sent a memorandum sketolung the line of boundary which would, tie thought, define the existing eastern possessions of Persia. The gist of the memorandum was as follows :— f The territories of Khelat now extend to the westward up to the borders of the Dizzuk • Eridence ia procurable, and may be taken and , Kolmk is claimed by Khelat, and reeorded. The fact is, that this claim is the very eviuenoe or allegiance brought forward in the one which the Persian Commissioner declined to P e rson of Mir Mirud Noushirwani the hereditary discuM at Bampur.

' Y , our Ei eellency will doubtless learn from General Goldsmid that, besides the tracts on this border, as to the present possession of which there can be no reasonable doubt, there Ate68 others, the sovereignty of which is uncertain, which are claimed by both partiei, but whioh, in the opinion of General Groldsmid, are in a position of virtual independence. With regard to euch of these tracts as lie to the west of the line which, from the information he has pro cured, General Goldsmid is disposed to regard as the fairest boundary to be laid down between Persia and Khelat, if the Shah's Government advances serious pretensions to them, it might, in the opinion of the Governor-General in Council, be allowed to deal with them as it pleases, Khelat being thereby deprived of nothing which is in her undoubted possession. But the Government of India would most seriously deprecate any concession of Persian claims to territory east of that line, except on production by Persia of the clearest evidence of right. The main object to be aimed at is the demarcation of such a definite boundary marked by natural features as will satisfy the just claims and reasonable expectations of both parties, and best accord with the present state of possession. From the information before him, Hi« Excellency in Council is of opinion that there are good reasons for considering the boundary sketched in General Goldsmid's letter No. 73, of 1st April (a copy of which he has been instructed to lay before you), to be fair and suitable, and if, by the exercise of your influence with the Shah's Government, Your Excellency cap procure the acknowledgment of that line, you will render an essential service to the interests of Her Majesty'^ Indian Empire, and effectually remove the cause of those apprehensions and actual disturbances, which have of late so seriously interfered with the prosperity of Mekran.' These letters to General Goldsmid and Mr. Alison were communicated to the Secretary of State in No. 2b, dated 16th May 1871. (lit).—The Persian Government accepts the line of boundary sketehed by General Goldsmid. Question about Kolml^ 85. In the execution of the instructions quoted above, General Goldsmid after visiting Kurrachi for the purpose of collecting further information as to the right of Khelat in the disputed tracts, betook himself to Teheran, and, when there, was obliged to await the arrival of the Persian Commissioner. There then followed a few meetings between the Commissioners, in the pre sence of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and between the latter and Mr. Alison, during which no advance was made towards a decision. 86 On the 3rd August, Mr. Alison in consequence of a telegram from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (the result of an expression of opinion on the part of the Government of India as to the extreme desirability of a speedy settlement of the question), addressed a memorandum to the Persian Minister, urging attention to the matter, 87.

On the 13th August the Shah announced his decision, abandoning Kedj and Gwadur, but including in Persia Kohuk and certain tracts comprised within the windings of the Dusht River. General Goldsmid represented the disturbance to existing possession on the part of Khelat which such a demarca tion would cause, and after some further interviews with the Persian Commis sioner and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs was, on the 20th August, 1 See enclosure No. 18 of the abore-mentioned granted another audience t by the Shah, ^spateh. who seemed as little as ever disposed to accept the line of boundary indicated by General Goldsmid, but, in addressing his Minister,— ' said something of accepting General Goldsmid's line, provided Her Majesty's Government would make a certain guarantee that the arrangement solely affected the Khan of Khelat and his descendants, his power being declared that of an independent sovereign. After leaving the Shah, General Goldsmid discussed this expression for some time with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Persian Oommig- sioner, and the King's Aide-de-Gamp «( The Khan of Khelat was to be considered as an independent sovereign, and England was to guarantee that this disputed country was to be his and that of his descendants. In the event of a revolution she would be responsible as to his successor.' Such, General Gold smid said, was the substance of a somewhat vague proposal to be put forward in case w® refused any deviation from our mapped line of frontier in favour of Pcreian claims or54 ,1 il pretensions. I nsked explanation of the object ef this alternative^ but the Minister gave me none more distinct than that apprehension was entertained of the intervention of some other Power.' It was agreed that this proposal should be communicated in writing, 88. On the 21st, General Goldsmid telegraphed to the Foreign Secre tary Supposing existing frontier accepted, would Government guarantee arrangements solely in the interest of Khelat Khan and his descendants; or what similar assurance could Persia expect ? ' The Poreign Secretary replied on the 23rd :— ' Whatever assurances Persian Government may give for preservation of boundary and maintfnance of peace, if sufficient, we should have little diffijulty in obtaining similar assur ances from Khan for himself and descendants. See Treaty of 1854 as to our power to keep Khan to his pledges/' And in reply to a telegram from Mr. Alison, similar to that from General Goldsmid above-quoted, the Toreign Secretary telegraphed on the 28th :— ' Khelat is no doubt an independent State on British frontier, but bound to us by engage ments contained in Treaty of 1854, of which, I presume, you have copy. Article ii bind^ Khan to subordinate co-operation, aad to abstain from negotiations with other Powers withoult our consent. Explain these provisions to Shah's Minister. ' Question of boundary cannot affect political position of Khelat or its relations with us. Eeference to independence not understood.' 89. Mr. Alison, having on the 29th August telegraphed that the line of boundary accepted by the Shah was described in General Goldsmid's letter of 13th April 1871, was on the 1st September thanked by the Foreign Secretary on the part of the Viceroy, and congratulated for the result of his negotiations. Similar thanks and congratulations were sent to General Goldsmid. 90. Here I quote an important extract from General Goldsmid's final report of his proceedings to the Secretary of State, dated 9th November 1871:— ' Without dwelling upon the political advantages of a defined frontier in a country like Mekran, the geography of which, and notably the valley of Kedj, exhibits an easy passage to India from the westward, 1 cannot but express a hope that tue settlement recently brought about will prove a lasting benefit to the inhabitants on either side the now acknowledged border. Khelat, especially, should encourage her cultivating classes to increased efforts to im prove the soil by free grants, remissions, and reductions rather than additional taxation, and uttention should be given to maintain within the Khan's assigned limits, a contented and non- intriguing population. ' An under-current of suspicion has been apparent on the part of Persia throughout the late enquiry. It is as though she were continually desirous of putting a question to which delicacy or fear allowed no shape or snbstance ; and if there can be right or reason in any sub version of the laws of meum, and tuum, it might be a hard one to answer. Expressed ia word® should be much as follows,—'Why should the small and unknown State of Khelat, whose natu ral limits are Jhalawanand Sarawan, retain tracts to the westward as far as Kedj and Punjgoi t , which Persia could possess herself of without a struggle ? These tracts, had they power, would be independent ; not having power to be independent, they are as fair prey to the strongest neighbour.' In tacit reply, as it were to this, it would be very desirable that Khelat should, under British advice, show herself in some degree worthy of British interference in holding the tracts assigned to her ; and substantial proof of her capability in such respect would, I respectfully submit, be a better guarantee for the maintenance of the status authoritatively declared and accepted, than a mere trust in a settlement effected by British mediation. If, on the other hand, Khelat t-hows herself weak and disorganized, without a recognized Khan and real Government, a prey to internal revolution and political intrigue, a bait will be thrown to the aggressors across the frontier which will at least be tempting, and pretences and excuses for transgression will be supplied where such should be wanting altogether.' 91. To turn now from the telegraphic to the written correspondence which terminated in this happy result. On the 22nd, Mr. Alison went by appointment* to the Persian Minister • See enclosure 11 of despatch No. 82, dated 20th ^or Foreign Affairs to hear a further COm- December, from the Government of India to munication on the subject. After a rene- the Secretary of State. wa j ^ ^ ^ ar g urnen t S} a]Q( J a suggestion thrown out that the question should be referred to London, which Mr. Alison met by saying that it would certainly be referred back to Teheran, and that— ' if the object of the Persian Government in raising these difficulties was to avoid coming to any decision on the subject, he, Mr. Alison, would be glad to be informed of it forI 55 communication to Her Majesty's Government. The Minister, after some reflection, ma^e a speecli on the proved friendly disposition of Her Majesty's Government towards Persia, and on the wish entertained by the Shah, under existing circumstances, to strengthen the relations between the two countries. As a proof of this he said that the King was ready to accept the frontier line drawn by General Goldsmid, if I would furnish them with a written statement to the effect that the territories on the Khelat side of the boundary formed the exc usive property of that independent State.' 92. Mr. Alison then sent a draft of the opening sentence of the proposed note regarding tbe boundary, worded so as to meet the views of the Shah thus expressed. 93. And this being accepted by the Shah, Mr. Alison, on the 1st Septem ber, addressed the following memorandum to the Persian Minister for Foreiori Affairs :— ' The undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipoten- Enclosure No. 13 o£ tlieabove-mentioned despatch- tiary at the Court of Persia, acting on the part , t p tt - ™ . . of his Government-, has the honor to submit, for the approval of His Majesty the Shah, a map in which the boundary line between the terri tories pos-essed in Baluchistan by Persia, and the territories forming the exclusive propeitv of the independent State of Khelat is delineated. . ma ^ t ^ us described. Commencing from the northernmost point, or that which is furthest from the sea, the territory of Khelat is hounded to the west by the lar^e Persian district ot Dizzuk, which is composed of manv dehs or minor districts, those on the nontier being Jalk and Kallegan. Helow these two last named is the small district of Kohuk, * tf.gether with Punjgur, comprisinsr Parum and other dependencies, is on the Khelafe side or the frontier while on the Persian side is Bumpusht. ' Below Punjgur, the frontier possessions of Khelat to the sea are Boleida, including Zamiran and other dependences, Mund, and Dusht. Within the Persian line of frontier are the villages or tracts belong 111- to Sirbaj and Bahai Dustyaree. The boundary of Dusht is marked by a long hne drawn through the Drabol Hill situated between the Rivers Bahai and Uusht, to the sea in the Bay of Gwuttur. 1 To summarise, Pnnjgur and Parum and other dependencies with Kohuk; Boleida, mcluding Zamiran and other dependencies; Mund, including Toomp, Nusseerabad, Kedj,and a 1 districts, dehs, and dependencies to the eastward ; Dusht with its dependencies as far as tie sea, these names exhibit the line of actual possession of Khelat, that is to say, all tracts to the east ot the frontier of actual Persian possession, which frontier comprises Dizzuk and Jjumpusht; feirbaz and Peshin^ Baho and Dustyaree. ' The undersigned proposes, with the concurrence of the Persian Government, that, for purposes or future reference and identification, he shall obtain the services of an experienced nglish Officer of Engineers, who may meet an officer duly appointed by the Government of Persia, and an officer from the Khelat State, so as to lay down the more prominent landmarks J? 1 featuves ot the actual line agreeably to the above description, and make a careful survey thereof for record. This subordinate Commission should meet as early as practicable in Gwuttur Bay, and proceed upwards from the boundary terminus between the Rivers Bahai and Dusht to Jalk or the neighbourhood, submitting the result of their work in the form of a map to the Representative of Her Britannic Majesty's Government and the Persian Govern ment at Teheran. 94i. Ihe Minister replied as follows on the 4th September , Excellency s letter of the 1st instant, together with the map of General Goldsmid, the British Commissioner, respecting the frontier line between the Persian possessions anci dependencies m Beloochistan, and the Beloochistan dependencies made over to the independent Mate ot Khelat, have been received and have both been submitted to His Majesty the Shah. • d I 11 obedience to His Majesty's orders I beg, in reply, most respectfully to state that the Persian Cxovernment, notwithstanding the clear right which it considered itself to have over Beloochistan, simply out of regard for the wishes of Her Britannic Majesty's Government t at this question should be brouiiht to a satisfactory conclusion by the definition of a oundaiy line, has hereby accepted Your Excellency's letter and the map. The Persian veininent now looks forward to the desirable results and important advantage which it expects from the British Government for this great act of compliance and co-operation on the part ot Persia, and awaits to see what will emanate from the suitable manner in which the maoter will be represented through the good offices of Your Excellency, an experienced Minister and a well-wisher, perfectly cognizant of the whole details of the merits of the question. * Enclosure No. 16 of the above-mentioned des- 95. This letter was accompanied by IT' '• . . one* of the same date from the -Foreign Minister, saying— In the la- 1 discussion with General Goldsmid, the Persian Government had contented itself wi requesting that a small portion of Persian Beloochistan, whicbi on the map has been56 1 included in the Khelat territory, inch as Kohuk, lefunder, and Konarbusteh, which are not large nor important places, should, for certain reasons, be made over to Persia. General Goldsmid haring excused himself on the plea that be was not authorized to entertain such a discussion on the part of his Government, the Persian Government has, therefore, referred this question to its own Eepresentative in London, who is to discuss this subject with the British Minister, and ask for a settlement which may be in unison with justice and friendship/' 96. The receipt of this communication conveyed to the Government of India the first intimation that any point regarding the boundary still remained for discussion. The papers were, by No. 2705P., dated 19tli December, sent to the Bombay Government, with the remark that— ' for the present the orders of Her Majesty's Secretary of State should be awaited before intimation of the boundary settled is given to the Khan of Khelat.' The Bombay Government, on receiving this letter, telegraphed to sav that they had already (14th December) directed the Commissioner in Sind to move the Khan to give his formal consent to accept the boundary line fixed by General Goldsmid, but had now telegraphed to him to postpone action if possible. They telegraphed again on the 25th that the Commissioner replied he had already sent on the instructions, but had now sent another letter to the Political Agent at Khelat, desiring him to keep back the communication if not already made. Thereupon the Bombay Government were, by No. 765P., dated 26th December, desired to state on what authority the orders were issued to procure the Khan's assent to the boundary. 97. As to the question of Kohuk there was the following further corre spondence :— The Secretary of State, in Secret No. 11, dated 24th November 1871, sent a memorandum from the Persian Minister at the Court of St. James, repeating the claim to the whole of Mekran based on possession in the time of Nadir Shah ; saying that, if the Shah's Government had abandoned those claims, it was onlv from deference to the wishes of the British Government; that the Shah would much have prefered, even in the interest of tranquillity in those parts, the line of the Nihung, which was the natural geographical boundary; that he had not pressed this point; but that there was one point in which he did desire General Goldsnrid's boundary line should be modified, viz., that instead of, to the north, adopting the natural boundary offered by the course of the Mashkid liiver it lay through a country devoid of natural features (terrains vagues) so as to leave an opening for encroachments and combats, and did so too in such a way as to deprive Persia of the villages of Kohuk, Konarbusta and Istunde. He urged, therefore, the adoption of the line of the Mashkid! Me wound up by the remark :— V. E. me permettra de ne pas lui dissimuler que dans plus d'une eirconstauce le Tr^ UVernei ^ e 2 m 8 .^; . Iin P le ' a . reil contre eu certains points de la part du Gouvernement des es une inflexibihte qui semblait peu dictee du desir d'etre agreable a un Gouvernement ami t qui aurait pu le decourager dans I'ceuvrc qu'il u'a pas cesse de poursuivre avec ardeur—celle e resserrere chaqu jour de plus en plus les bons rapports qui unissent nos deux pays.' o- -cw? ^P r ?^ on appears due to the fact that General, or, as he was now, fw u (j0icIsmi '&gt; when pressed to allow Persia the possession of Kohuk, replied that he was not permitted to do so by the tenor of his instructions from the Government of India. His own view of those instructions is given in the following extract from the remarks at the end of his final Keport of his proceedings submitted to the Secretary of State, on the 7th November 1871: Ihe Government of India would admit of no half measures, such as the intervention of a neutral or independent tract between Persia and Khelat, agreeably to my own proposal to mee the ox.genoy. Under the cireumstancee, I had ro resource but to deellre P Kohuk . e a district until the statements were disproved, and as disproof was not attempted when c allenged, I expressed and obtained acceptance of the whole line as originally declared. ^ ie i n structions of the Government of India were really of a Terr different complexion. They were contained in No. 1012P., dated 22nd May and were as follows :t i. a '.ZS reSPe ? t0 Kolmk, His Excellency in Council observes that the question to be settled •imple question of boundary. If the Persian Government can estsblish no claim to take57 their boundary to the east of Kohuk, the line should be drawn to the west. But this point can only be settled at Teheran on the production, and after consideration, of all the informa tion in the possession of the mission. Once the boundary line is laid down, the question whether Kohuk should be declared independent, or considered as included in Khelat, is a very secondary question, with which it does not seem expedient for the Government of'India to concern itself at present.' 98. On Mohsin Khan's note the following memorandum was written bv Sir H. Eawlinson ^ On referring to Captain Lovett's map of the new Perso-Belooch frontier, the claim of Persia to the district of Kohuk would seem to be geographically valid, for the district in ques tion, as the boundary is now coloured, appears like a half detached peninsula intruding into Persian territory. Politically also Sir F. Goldsmid seems to have had serious doubts as to which power the district ought to belong, and ultimately, as far as I can judge, he allowed the claim of Persia to lapse by default. ' Under such circumstances, the protest now sent in by the Persian Minister in London may, I think, be in so far entertained that the case be sent out for the consideration of the Government of India, and in the meantime an assurance may be given that, in the event of its being judged expedient to embody the late arrangement concluded at Teheran in a formal Convention, due attention will be paid to the arguments contained in His Excellency's memorandum, with a view to the rectification of any errors that may be found on further examination to attach to the proposed line of delimitation. ' Captain St. John should then be directed to pay particular attention to the disputed dis trict of Kohuk in his contemplated survey of the frontier, collecting on the spot all available evidence witli regard to the past and present dependency of the contested villages, and ascer taining the wishes of the inhabitants in respect to the future allegiance. ^ I cannot believe that the acquisition of these insignificant villages with a few square miles of surrounding desert can be a matter of real political importance either to the Persian or the Khelat Government. The question at issue is one of honour rather than of substantial value and in th:.t view it would be, I think, to our advantage if without violating justice or giving real cause of offence to the Khan of Khelat, we c^uld confer an obligation upon the Shah of Persia by modifjiug the Mekrau frontier arrangement in his favour/'' 99. The papers sent hy the Secretary of State were communicated to General Goldsmid, to whom the whole question was referred, with the remark— ^ that the Government of India will be quite content to accept whatever view you mny arrive at with the further information which you may be able to procure durino- your mission to Seistan ' 100. On receipt of Mr. Alison's despatch showing that the question of the sovereignty of Kohuk had been referred to London, Gener al Goldsmid * Secret March 1872, Nos. 155-2C0. ^ telegram No. 2764P.,* dated 26th December 1871, asked whether, pending the settlement or the question, he advised that Major St. John should demarcate the Kohuk boundary or not, aud, if he did, whether he should demaicate it on both sides. 101. He has replied by telegram t Secret May 1862, Nos. 15-46. without date, despatched from Heniam on the I5tht: — ' If discussion is renewed, and survey found quite practicable, it seems advisable to have every detail mapped so as to settle question finally either way.' 1 102. The request of the Persian Government in regard to Kohuk was so far agreed to by Her Majesty's Government, that the line forming the western boundary of Khelat was drawn to the east of Kohuk, but no opinion was expressed as to the position of the Persian frontier. Kohuk was occupied by the Persian troops in 1874. As regards tue further history of the disputed boundary see notes in Secret E, October 38^9, Nos. 9)—131 and the correspondence in Secret E, February 1894, Nos. 328—333. It must be noted, however, that this history does not come within the province of this precis. 462 F. D.58 CHAPTER VIII.

June 1883, Nos. 276-278. seems since 1880 to have concerned him- self more than usually in its affairs. In 1883 Major Mookler, then on special dutv submitted a report dated 28th March on the political^ condition of the district, at the time and for a few years previously, which is summarised below :— . -r. t i • i. 107. The Governors of the several districts of Persian Baluchistan were reported to be as follows : Sartip Suleiman Khan (Persian) Bampur. Mir Eoti (Boleidi and Barr) Geh, Kibleh; his son M6him Khan lived at Bint Lashar. Sartip Ibrahim Khan (Bami) B6dbar. Mir Mauladdd J an Mahomed (Boleidi and Barr) Kasr Kand, Sirbaz. jlf jr DUdwat* Khan {JUalifc) Dizzak, Magas ; his son Mir Abdullah lives at Jalk. Sarddr Bnsain Khan (Ndr6i)—nothing at this time-his brother Chakar Khan lived at Fan6ch. Mir Din Mahomed (Jadgal) Dashtyari. Mir Mahomed A.li (Jadgal) Bahu. His Boyal Highness Nasir-ud-dowla bad commanded all of them to meet him at Bampur on his return from Charbar, in order that the taxes for each district might be finally fixed and possibly some alteration may then be made in the Governors appointed to each. It appeared that on his advent into the country and on his journey through it, the Shahzada had promised large remissions in the usual amount of taxes demanded from each district, but whether these promises will be adhered to in the end, Major Mockler had great doubts. 108. It should be noted that -.—Sardar Ibrahim Khan was supposed, to be friendlv with Busain Khan and his brother Chakar Khan, and unfriendly with Mir Dilawar Khan. Mir Dildwar Khan friendly with Mir Mauladad and unfriendly with Sardar Husain Khan. Mir Mauladad unfriendly with Husain Khan with Ibrahim Khan and Chakar Khan. Sardar Husain Khan, friendly with Sartip Ibrahim Khan, unfriendly with DiMwar Khan and with Mir Mauladad on account of the latter having married a daughter ofDm Mahomed of Dashtvari. Between Dm Mahomed-i-Abdi (Chief of Dashtyari) and Sardar Husain Khan there has always been great enmity so much so that Dm Mahomed senerallv speaks of Husain Khan as ' Husain K6r (blind Husam), ^d Husain K?an of ^)in Mahomed as ' Chuki Abdf' (Abdi's son). Ibrahim Khan bad been for very many years the principal and most poweiful Chief m Persian Baluchistan and at various times has managed to get into his clutches, imprison and mulct to his own advantage most of the other district it is said, probably truly, that the late raid by Sardar Husain Khan into Dash tvari was made through the representations and at the instigation of Ibrahim Khan on the pretext, of course, of the non-receipt of taxes, so heavy as to be almost impossible of collection, but really because he was annoyed at having failed to entice Din Mahomed, whom he suspected of being worth squeezing to come to Bampur, and he could have hardly found a more willing instrument60 than Sardar Husain Khan. On this occasion Din Mahomed fled the country being accompanied by all who could possibly leave. On the departure of Husain Khan with his army he appears to have returned to Dashtyari, and as a matter of course to have been recognised as Chief as heretofore. In conse quence of the Resident's representations through the Ambassador at Teheran, Sardar Husain Khan as reported was imprisoned, and made doubtless to disgorge' a portion, at any rate, of his Dashtyari loot, and Sartip Ibrahim Khan removed from the Governorship of Bampur. During Din Mahomed's absence, his son Abdullah, who has for many years been on ill terms with his father, from whom he received no allowance or means of subsistence, having accompanied the army of Husain Khan into Dashtyari and pointed out those from whom it might be possible to wring money, was appointed by Husain Khan, Governor of Charbar. On the departure of Husain Khan and the return of his father, he left Charbar, and his whereabouts was not known. Such family disagreements the Persians were not slow to take advantage of. Between Din Mahomed and Mahomed Ali, respectively Chiefs of Dashtyari and Bahu, who are first cousins, there had been a jealousy and ill-feeling extending over many years, through which, both play into the hands of others, to their own weakening and ruin. Both districts were very heavily taxed ; from Dashtyari including Charbar Rs. 10,000 yearly, and 10 n Biliu Ks. 5,000 was demanded. In 1882 Mahomed Ali managed to scrape together and pay Rs. 4,800 ; he then went to Bampur to try and get the amount reduced, but being unsuccessful, he refused the Sardarship of Bahu and retired to G wet tar. Upon which Mir Mauladad came to Bahu and, having promised Azum Khan, brother of Mahomed Ali, the Sardarship, with his help managed to screw something out of the unfortunate inhabitants, and asked for the telegraph suMdy which was very properly not given to him, Azum Khan accompanied Mir Mauladad on his return to Kasrkand, but did not succeed in gettino- the Sardarship, and eventually returned empty-handed to Bahu. Sardar Husain Khan, however, who was Azum Khan's uncle on Ids mother's side, came to Kasrkand, imprisoned Mir, Mauladad, took the money he had collected in Bahu from him and uither inflicted a heavy fine, most of which was paid by the Barr tribe, his father- m-law, Din Mahomed, aiso contributed Rs. 1,000. Mahomed Ali informed me that for the last eight months Bahu has really been without a Sardar, that, however, the Shazadah had now reduced the yearly taxes to Rs. 3,000 (Bahu Rs. 1,000, Gwettar, Rs. 2,000) and conferred the Sardarship on him in writing: and that for the year 1S83-84 the Shazadah had consented to receive Rs. 1 000 m tull payment of all taxes which amount he had been ordered to collect and take to Bampur at once. Major Mockler suspected that when Mahomed Ali could get to Bampur he would find that Gwettar was not to be included in the Balm district, and that the promised reduction of his taxes would turn out a delusion. Dm Mahomed laid claim to Gwettar, and Mahomed Ali asked Major Mockler to tell the Prince that it had belonged to Bdhu for at any rate the last 10 years, which he did, taking Mahomed Ali with him and explammg that he did so at his request, but afterwards the Shazada sent Din Mahomed s son Abdi to Gwettar. 109. The heavy taxation, the want of rain during the past three years, the bursting of the bank of the river by which Bahu is fertilised, so that the water escapes into the salt desert without profit, had almost depopulated Bahu, and the tew families who remained were in a state more than bordering on famine. Mahomed All stated thit if the taxes were reduced he would at once bund the river, and that his people would return when he called upon them to do so. Ihere was then the question of the payment of the telegraph subsidies to these two Ghiets, which had been raised both on the occasion of Mahomed Ali's nominal resi.gnatmn of the Chiefdom of Bahu, and on that of Din Mahomed's ilight before the advent of Husain Khan's army into his country, the ephemeral locmn tenens, m each instance, demanding that it should be paid to him. The tot object of these subsidies was to secure the telegraph line from molestation, and therefore to be paid to the Chief whose good will was most necessary and efficacious. ^ It was not known how the districts of Bahu and Dashtyari came into possession of the Jadgals, whether by deed of gift, or by purchase, but at an J thlS J tr ??! ; liad been here ditary in the family of which Din Mahomed and Mahomed All were the heads, since their first settlement in the country some 150 years ago, and to them the inhabitants yielded ready and unswerving allegiance Ihere had hardly been a single instance of damage done to the telegraph line in these districts, and thoug'i no hard or fast rule for the political61 future would be laid down, Major Mockler thought that they being hereditary Chiefs, it was within our right and probably our best policy to strengthen their hands, by a cold and somewhat tardy recognition of such temporary appoint ments to, or usurpations of their authority, had been noticed, and should no unforeseen circumstances show it to be positively unadvisable to do so, to pay them their subsidies, without comment, when the day comes round, in silent recognition of their influence in those districts. 110. In 1865 when Colonel Eoss wrote his memorandum on Mekran, the taxes of Bahu and Dashtyari jointly were Ks 5,000 per annum, since then they had been raised year by year to Ks. 15,000, without, of course, anything whatever having betm done for the welfare or improvement of the country by the Persian Government. Nevertheless, complaints of oppression were very rnre in these districts, although the Chiefs often find it almost impossible to raise the sums demanded fro n them.

A., November 1888, Nos. 38-41. as rewar( j f or good service done. The Persian Government receive in addition to the amounts paid to the local chiefs a subsidy of Rs. 12,000 a year under the Telegraph Convention for the Perso-Balochistan line, and could not claim the local subsidy should be paid through their Persian Governors at Bampur. The question then was who was the local Baluchi chieftain appointed by the Persian Government. 118. It was ultimately decided by Colonel Ross that as the Sartip of Bampur had authority to appoint a Extl A., January 1889, Nos. 19-20. local Governor, the balance of the subsidy could be paid to Sayyid Mahomed who had been placed in charge of the Geh district (Colonel Ross's telegram No. 4i ( j0, dated 24th November 1888). 119.

In this connection see history of the Jask Station, chapter VIII. 120. In February 1889 it was reported that Mir Abdul Nabbi accompanied Saad-ul-Mulk to Jask in the JPersepolts, Extl.

In his brother Mohsin Khan he found a worthy instrument in his misrule. In 1889 the exasperation of the Baluchis reached such a pitch that most of the chiefs revolted and besieged him in his fort at Bampur. In August 1889 it was reported that Abul b ath Khan was captured by Murad Khan (Telegram from the clerk in charge Charbar to the Director, Karachi, dated 20th August 1889).

In January 1892 Abdul Nabhi agiiin obtained control of tbp country round Jask from the Deputy Governor of Bundar Abbas The holder as first refused to gire up the district and some desultory fighting occ^65 but with no definite result. Mir Abdul Nabbi soon became master of the district an dbegan to levy taxes from the people, and created considerable discontent everywhere which threatened to lead to serious disturbances. 1230. In 1894 the country round Jask was much disturbed by a quarrel, , with serious results, between two of the i8£ £ 6 AdmimBtt '' ,0a Ee P ort8forlS94 - 95 '' ld neighbouring Sardars. In a/was arising out of an attempt to settle a dispute by the seizure of certain camels, the son of Mir Ali was shot dead by the party of Mir Abdul Nabbi, whose arrest was ordered by the authorities. Both parties referred to the officers of the Telegraph, Mir Ali asking for help of ammunition which was refused. The Sardars were later summoned to Bunder Abbas; but Mir Abdul Nabbi having been attacked en route and a fight ensuing in which a few were killed, he refused to continue his journey, and was subse quently deprived of his authority. The subsidy allowed by the Telegraph, for the protection of their line, was consequently transferred to Mir Haji Yasuf whose appointment had been intimated. Mir Abdul Nabbi died in December 1895. Sardar Din Mahomed Khan of Dashtiyari died in 1894 and was succeeded by his son Abdi Khan to the chiefship.66 CHAPTER IX. Jask Telegraph Station. (i) The Detachment at Jask, 124 A detachment of native infantry to be stationed at Jask was first ordered there under Military Department See biatory given in Quarter Master General's J^o. 17-P., dated 19th Julv 1877, for the Txtot! e \ 8t 'oS7™ 7 7, No*. 13-228 protection of the Indo-European Tele- (Ko. 96), and also Gulf Administration Report for graph establishment. A detacnment 01 1886-87. page io. Native Infantry was at the same time ordered to be sent to Gwadur for the protection of the Political Officer and British subiects. The party then consisted of one native officer and 35 men, two-thirds bein» ordered to Gwadur and the remainder to Jask, but owing to the want of proper accommodation at the latter station, the party did not move there until December 1878, when the detachment at Bassidore was ordered to be relieved and reduced to the strength of a Havildar's guard, owing to the nnhealthiness of the station. One Native officer, _3 Havildars. 4 ^iks and 62 privates then proceeded to Jask, thus maintaining the full strength of the details considered necessary on the coast of Baluchistan. In January 1880, Government decided to reduce the detachment at Gwadur to a Non-Commissioned Officer's guard of 12 men owing to the extreme unhealthiness of the place, and the surplus men (about 6 m number) were scut to Jask. In December 1880, the detachment at Gwadur was still further reduced to 8 men the remaining five being sent to Jask. Shortly afterwards the whole of the men were withdrawn from Gwadur to regimental head-quarters. The strength of the party at Jask then stood at about 91 men, and it remained at that strength more or less since that date up the year 1887. (ii) British control and jurisdiction within the Station, 125 In May 1884, five men of the detachment of sepoys stationed at Jask, whilst out, were tired upon and External A., October 1888. Nos. 69- 8. ro hbed of some money by two natives. Mr. Sealy, Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs, in charge Jask, made enquiries* into the matter, and Abdul Nabbi, Chief of Jask, being away at the time managed to recover some of the money at once^ from Abdul Nabbi's Munshi. The remainder was paid by Abdul Nabbi himself on Lis return. 126. In March 1885, Mr. Patton, Assistant Superintendent in charge Jask, brought to the notice of the Director of Persian Telegraphs (letter dated 13th March 1885) that shortly after the Jask Station was first opened, in consequ ence of the numerous petty annoyances caused by the Paluchis and their Chiefs, it was thought advisable by the late Directors, Mr. Walton and Colonel Lewis Pellv, that some nominal boundary should be defined within which the Chiefs should not be allowed to interfere. On representations being made to the then Governor of Bunder Abbas, Haji Ahmed Khau, a Commission composed of several Persian Officers were sent down to Jask, and as the creek formed for part of the way a natural boundary it was adopted, and a line drawn from the creek to the sea in the Last Bay was also made a boundary, a survey was ordered to be made and a plan drawn out. Within this limit it was decided that no customs should be collected or any interference permitted by the chiefs and for some years this practice existed and worked wtll. 126A. No record of any correspondence on this an angcment could be found 'either in the Director's office, or at the Legation, nor is there anything in our records on this matter.67 (iii) Interference of Persian Officials within Jask Station limits—Remoral of detachment and agreement about Jask Station, ISS' j —1887. 127. At tbe close of the year 1856, we received reports of a Persian .. , 00 - 10 00l3 Governor, Nasrullah Khan, having External a., October 1887, Nob. 13-228. &lt; i i i i • -j-i • j .\ t •; £ established himseii within the limits ot the Telegraph Station collecting customs on provisions imported for use of the establishment and its servants and otherwise making himself obnoxious to them. It was also found that the people had planted date offshoots round the station well, the water-supply of which was very limited. Most of these were removed on the 'Resident's desire by the people. 128. Soon after Sir A. iSicolson telegraphed to us that the Shah was much disturbed by the size of our detachment, about which and our position there exaggerated reports had been sent to Teheran by a Erench merchant and intriguer. The suspicion created by these reports in the mind of the Shah seriously affected the chances of his getting a Railway concession, about which negotiations had been going on. 129. The difficulty was settled by our agreeing to remove the detachment from Jask, in place of which it was decided at first to send a police guard of 20 men, but subsequently to levy natives of the place as guards. On the Shah's part, it was agreed to remove the obnoxious Governor, Nasrullah Khan, and to conclude an agreement as to the Jask Station, in which the area and boundaries of the station are defined, and certain privileges secured for the Telegraph officials and their servants, exemption from Persian interference within those limits and from payment of customs and other taxation on provisions. It is provided also ttiat no protection or refuge should be given within the station to any natives, except to the servants of the Telegraph establishment.* This agreement is dated 25th February 1887. It was slightly modified later on—that is, on 3rd July lb87, by changing the boundaries. A note was added in the margin of the old agreement stating the new boundaries. Maps of the station were signed and exchanged between Ameen-es-Sultan and Sir A. Nicolson. A copy of this map will be found in Extract A, October 1887, Nos. 13—228 (No. 222 C). Nasrullah Khan left Jask in April, and was replaced by Hidayat Khan. 130. In his telegram dated 22nd September 1887, the Resident reported to ^ His Maiesty's Charge d'Affaires, Teheran, External A., October 1887, os. 96- 98. that a Persian Government patrol of over 100 men under the command of General Mahomed Kazim arrived at Jask from the District Rudbar. They were to return to Karman, leaving 50 men at Jask for garrison purposes. (iv) Alleged Persian interference within Task Station, 1889. 131. In February 1889 Saad-ul-Mulk visited Jask in the Fersepalis, with Mir Abdul Nabbi on board, who was not, External A., May 1889, Nos. 265 -266. hoWCVCr, allowed to land. It was reported that he was not to be released unless he paid 4,000 krans, ijave a hostage and found a security that he would not misconduct himself, as he did, when he was chief of the J ask District, e find soon aftei Abdul Nabbi' the other Baluchi Chief imprisoned in 1887, released and back in Mekran. Soon after the departure of Saad-ul-Mulk, a wife of a boatman in the employ of the Telegraph establishment and residing within the station, was dragged, when outside the lines, to the Governor's house and reported to have been ill-treated in connection with a dispute with the wife of the Governor's Munshi, who appears to have also resided within the lines. 131A. The following opinion was expressed on these proceedings by Colonel Ross in his letter, dated 25th March 1889, to the address of Sir Henry Drum- mond Wolf:— ' The agreement of 26th February 1887, wliich Sir A. Nicolson concluded with the Persian Government, provides that Persian officials shall not interfere in any way withm the W assigned to the British Telegraph Department at .Task, but of course ths does not confer jurisdiction over Persian subjects within those limits on British officials, though the prohibi tion of direct action of the Persian officials practically gives a certain protection to Persian subjects in British employ. In case of serious offences, I am of opinion that the accused Dersons being Persian subjects would have to be made over to the Persian authorities, in the case brought to notice it does not seem clear that the terms of the agreement have been altogether infringed and in the circumstances as reported, I think it well to avoid possibly inconvenient discussion by letting the matter drop.' * Aitcbiuson's Treaties (1892j— Volume X, page 93.69 139. Eepresentations were made at Teheran, and after a good deal of usual battering at the doors of the Persian authorities, the matter was settled in August 1885, in the presence of Mir Mahomed Ali, who had been re-instated, at Balm, by the payment of Rs. 408 by Abdul rsabbi to the brother of the late Ali Baksh Khoja. The Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs, Mr. P. Pfinch, wrote to Sardar Mahomed Ali of Palm, thanking him for his assistance and stating that the settlement was approyed. (iii) Plunder of Hindu Traders of Dizzalt and Geh, 1884. 140. Two Hindu traders of Dizzak were plundered of tbeir property between Dizzak and Seistan in 18b4. One Eternal A, ^ ^ o£ t jiem wag allege(i to have lost p r0 p er ty Do. March Nos. 3ti7.369. valued at Rs. 1,500, the claim was settled Do. June 1888. Nos. 420431. Q-ovemor of Kerman only towards Do.

(iv) Seizure at Charbar of Dosliambi, a sailor of a Britisli Indian Vessel—Arrangements for his release, 1885. 141. A man named Doshambi, formerly a slave, made his escape from Pareg External a , March 1885, Nos. 182-202. about the year 1880 and sought refuge at Do. May I8fc5, Nos. S62-465. Karachi. In 1885, he took service on a Ba^hla, flying, the British flag, which was proceeding from Karachi to Bushire, whilst at Charbar in the Baghla's dingy, the Chief of Pareg forcibly seized and carried Doshambi away, claiming him as his property. 142. Under instructions from the Resident, Mr. P. Pfinch called upon Mir Hoti, the Governor of Geh, to have the man released. Colonel Ross also wrote to His Majesty's Minister in view to Sir R. Thomson representing the matter to the Persian authorities, if necessary. 143. Mir Hati at first refused to release Doshambi unless compensation waspaid 'tohis owner, but on receipt of paremptory orders from the Governor of Kerman, he sent his son to Cbarbar to set free the slave at once. ir (v) Dliarmu Mulchand's case, 1888-1889. 144.

The amount due was then recovered from Dharmu, who was reported by Colonel Ross to have been 'sold up, ruined, andsubTectedto cruel ill-treatmentthis happened in January 1888. 14,5 From what the Governor of Kern an ascertained in the matter hp did not think that there were any grounds of complaint But Colonel Boss, informed the British Charg6 d'Affaires at Teheran that 'it is clearly the duty of the Persian Government to recover from their own officials the sum exacted from Dharmu' that the entire proceedings ot the Persian Governor of Bam- pur should he strongly objected to, « and that redress should be insisted on both for the pecuniary losses of Dhartnu and for the personal ill-treatment, he, a British subject, has suffered'. 146 After bringing to bear a good deal of pressure on the Persian authori ties the Governor of Bampur was instructed l.y Sadr Mam to satisfy the claim which was valued by Mr. F. Flinch at Es. 8,000, which aomunt was at last paid in December 1888. 4626 P. D.70 CHAPTER XI. Rising of Baluchi tribes, anarchy in Mekran, murder of Mr. Graves, British detachments stationed at Jask and Charbar, British policy, 1806—98. 147. In 1896 tliere was, at Charbar, serious and lonsf-contimied trouble Gulf Administration Reports for 1896-97 and regarding rival claims to the subsidies 18,,/ 9 . 8 ' . P a i^ by the Telegraph Department, in consideration of protection for their land line. The superior provincial autho rity at Bampur, being itself at one time contested and in doubt, the sub ordinate local Chiefs who were the recipients of the telegraph subsidies, were in conflict in regard to the title to the payments as derived from one or other of the contending superiors. The position was bv no means an easy one for the Telegraph Superintendent, on whom the rivardemands were constantly pressed with insolent menace, and even a resort to violence against thy persons and property of British Indian traders. Some of these were seriously wounded, in the course ol one of these importunate attempts to secure payments of the Dashtiyary subsidy in August. It became necessary to despatch H. M S Sphinx to Charbar to prevent a repetition of this violence, but an appeal through H. M. Legation to the Government at Teheran only elicited the fact of the utter povrerlessness of the State authority in these regions. The matter was shortly afterwards settled for the time by pavment for the half-year up to June 1896 being made to Mohamed Khan, one of the claimants, whose title seemed to be the most in order. In February of 1897 there was a recrudescence of the same dispute, and it was necessary, in order to avoid the risk of mischief, to make the next payment to another candidate who appeared to have substantial support. In January the Resident visited Charbar in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence at the desire of H. M Minister m the hope of being able to bring some influence to bear on the ' turbulent local Chiefs, who were practically quite beyond the control of the Persian Government.^ None of these leaders were, however, found at Charbar at the time of the visit, and an interview was thus impossible. 147A. Further the state of lawlessness was aggravated from the weik. ness of the Persian rule in the country Nominally forming part of Persia, the littoral, from the entrance to the Gulf to the border of British Baluchistan, is occupied by a number of Baluch clans ruled over by their own headmen, who yield but a reluctant and passing submission to the Central Government of Teheran. The Persians keep no regular troops permanently in the country, and their rule is maintained bv periodical raids to levy revenue, in the course of which the country is laid waste, and cultivation destroyed, innocent people being killed or ruined The Baluchis have in consequence a deep hatred for the Persians, and the history of the country of late years consists of successive revolts followed bv successive conquests by the Persians, who are alwavs able to overcome the Baluchis, who can never unite to resist attack, but are, on the contrary, always ready to betray each other should a favourable opportunity offer. The events of the past years, though exceptional in some respects, have passed on the same general lines. There were many causes for discontent. The rainfall usually scanty, had either failed entirely during the past two or three years or the crops, when there has been rain, had been destroyed by locusts The result was a general and widespread distress. Though the harvest had failed, the Persians enhanced the revenue demand and this caused deep and widespread discontent and hatred of the Persian Government. 147B. Superstition helped to spread the wave of discontent and led to a revolt of the tribes. A general belief in the fulfilment of an old prophecy to the effect that the dynasty would end with the late Shah, was reported to prevail, and this71 belief was said to be confirmed in the minds of the people by the absence of any ruler of weight or position at Kerman, from which the Firman Eirma, a more than usually vigorous Persian Administrator, had, soon after the Shah's death, be taken, himself to the capital. The popular voice accordingly affirmed that the fulfilment of the prophecy had come, and that no Shah in fact existed. This sime belief was curiously heard of later as prevailing around Jask also. 1^8. In JFebruary 1897 reports were received of disturbances and com- External A, April 1897, No.. 191.211. P 1 ®' 6 «^by and disorder ruling in Persian Baluchistan, and Colonel Wilson was obliged to write to Sir Mortimer Durand—' I deem it my duty to urge that this position, i.e.^ the complete abnegation by the Persians of the ordinary duties and responsibilities of a Government in quite normal circumstances is fraught with peril to our interests and their fulfilment of the first obligations of a Government should be insisted upon.' The leader of the disturbances was Eusain Khan, who we have referred to frequently before [ he^ had been appointed a Governor of Dashtiyari andCharbar in 18S1 and was removed from his place on account of his oppres sive rulej. In January 1897 he deputed his brother Mir Ashraf Khan to the Director of the Persian Gulf telegraphs in political charge of the Mekran coast complaining of Persian oppression and asking for British protection. 149. The other ring-leaders in the insurrection were :— Mir Abdulla j Sardar Kaderdad Khan. Sardar Mohomed Khan. 150. Zain-ul-Abadin was the Governor of Bampur at this time, and the discontent ot the Baluchis was attributed to the rigour with which he exacted his heavy imposts at a time when the people had been impoverished by a bad season and his tyranny and oppression in other ways. The Governor marched with the troops available against the insurgents, but could do little for quell ing the insurrection. 151. The British Government could not look on unconcerned in this state of things, for on one side there was great danger to our telegraph and the employes connected with it, and on the other hand the British Indian subjects residing at Jask, Oharbar and other places in Mekran would be great sufferers with in life and property by the disturbances, unless they were quickly stopped. 152. In April 1897 the village of Jask was raided upon by about 80 c , Baluchis and several British Indian Secret E„ August 1897, Nos. 109-116. , t i ^ f i j traders were looted of property valued at about Rs. 5,000. Mr. Wyndham at once brought these facts to the notice of the Mushir-ed-Dovvlah and in view of ttie importance of the Persian Government to afford proper protection to the inhabitants of Jask he instructed the Hesident at Bushire to despatch the Sphinx, if he should think it necessary for the protection of the lives and property of British subjects at Jask. 153. The Persian ship JPersepolis was despatched to Jask in order to restore order and on arrival garrisoned the fort with 100 Serbazees, artillery, etc. 15^. There was no doubt that the Balu Vuis had legitimate and real griev- c ^04- u lorvr xt ances against the rule of Zain-ul-Abadin, Secret E, September 1897, Nos. 139-187. Governo ' r of Jiampur. Mr. Charles Hardinge, British Charge d'Affaires at Teheran, made therefore strong representations to the Shah's Government, with the result that Zain-ul-Abadin was recalled and the charge of the province was temporarily entrusted to Suleiman Khan. (ii) Murder Of Mr. Graves and measures taken to trace and punish the murderers- December 1897—January 1898. 155. In the midst of this disturbed state of the country Mr. Graves, Acting _ _ , Superintendent in Telegraph Department, E ' Aug ' 9t 1898 ' Nm - 11 - 23ir - was murdered on the night of 2nd Decern- bar 1897 by Baluchis at the Rapch river half-way between Charbar and Jask. See paragraph 108, ante.72 156. Mr. Graves was about 52 years of age, and had been formerly on the Resideufc Colonel Meade's report, dated 2l8t March Bushire to lelieran Section of the tele- 1898, graph line. At the time of his murder he was on his annual tour of inspection, and had completed the first portion, from Jask, his head-quarters, to the banks of the Rapch river, a distance of some 96 miles'. He had crossed over to the left or eastern side of the river, and was encamped about 750 yards from the left bank. Here he tapped the line with a telephone, and had his own camp. His head native assistant, the artificer Hassan Khan, was encamped about 2 miles distant on the further side of the river, and it was from him that the news of the murder was received early the following morning sent by telephone. Mr. Graves was murdered on the night of the 2nd December 189*7. 157. In the course of the same day the Resident—Colonel Meade—received telegraphic instructions from Mr. Hardinge, who was in charge of the Legation, during the absence of Sir Mortimer Durand, and was directed to proceed as soon as he could to the scene of the murder, and hold an enquiry. Mr. Hardinge was also of opinion that measures for the capture and execution of the murderers shou'd be Ifift to the Persian Government and that the British officers should confine themselves to establishing the Joct that the crime had been committed by Persian subjects, and satisfying themselves that suitable punishment had been meted out. 158. The Persian Government at once ordered the gunboat Persepolis, then at Bushire, to proceed to the Mekran coast. She was got ready in a wonderfully short time, and left on the 6th December, taking 80 soldiers, the Darya Begi or Persian admiral being in command. 159. At that particular time there was no British gunboat at Bushire ; but H. M. S. Lapwing was known to be on her way from Bombay, and the B. I. M. S, Lawrence was also expected from the same place, touching at Maskat. The Resident also communicated with the Political Agent at Basrah, and asked him to expedite despatch of the Pigeon which was then engaged in patrolling the Shat-al-Arab, There was some delay in her arrival at Bushire, first, in consequence of her being engaged in investigating a case of piracy in the river, and subsequently from a heavy north-westerly gale, which prevented her crossing the bar at the mouth of the Shat-al-Arab, and from communicating with the shore, when she arrived at Bushire. 160. On the 11th December, however, the Pigeon started for the Mekran coast taking Captain Sykes, and Consul for Kerman and Persian Baluchistan, who happened to be at Bushire on other duty and volunteered to go, and Mr. Campbell of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, who had been appointed to succeed Mr. Graves, and whose services were placed at the Resident's disposal by the Telegraph Department. 161. Colonel Meade had originally intended going himself in the Pigeon, but decided to wait, as he had heard on the 10th that the Lawrence was on her way to Bushire, audit wsus more convenient to employ her for the purpose, and as there was important work going on at the time in connection with the seizure of arms at Bushire iWdf. He left Bushire on tlie 14th December and arrived off the mouth of the Kapch on the 18th at daybreak. He found there the Pigeon, the telegraph cable ship Patrick Stewart, and the Persepolis and ascertained that the two latter vessels had arrived on the 10th December. 162. The Persians, with the assistance given by Mr. Etinch, and his subordinates, moved inland on the 14th, and were followed by Captain Sykes, who took Commander Mowbray and a party of 30 men of the Pigeon. On the 6th they joined the Persians at the place where the telegraph line crosses the river, and the Darya Begi there saw a number of the Kirwan tribe of Baluchis to which the murderers belonged. They engaged to deliver up four of the culprits the following day, but, on their failing to do this, the Persian commander decided to advance into the Kirwan district, which lies on the west side of the Rapch river. This advance took place on the 18th December and when Colonel Meade reached Galag on that day, he was informed that Mr. Campbell had been left alone at the original encampment, on the east side of the river, which had been placed in telegraphic communication with Galag in a very expeditious manner by the telegraph officials, acting under Mr. rfinch's direction.73 163. Colonel Meade landed at Galag on the 18th December and went the following morning to the position on the east bank of the river, where Mr. Campbell had been left. On his arrival a local headman, named Mir Esa bin Sher Khan, was brought to him by Mr. Graves' Artificer, Hassan Khan, and he was told that he had gone the previous day with the Persians into the country of the Kirwanis, but had left them, as he thought that the Persian commander was about to have him seized. 164. Mir Esa was subsequently denounced as a traitor by Captain Sykes, who declared that he had purposely misled the march the previous day, and had deserted them at the moment when they approached the villages of the Kirwanis. On the other hand, Mr. Campbell and the telegraph officials declared that he had given them much useful assistance, and that but for him they could not have collected the necessary baggage camels for transporting the'party. They assured the Resident that if he was not kindly treated their camelmen would desert, and, in view of this, he had told Mir Esa that, if he did well in future, he would be trusted, and his services rewarded. 165. Mir Esa agreed to go with Hassan Khan and endeavour to bring in some of the Kirwanis, who had not themselves been engaged in the murder. The following day he returned bringing with him three headmen, tiz.^ Pirdad, Mullah Mem and Miran. All three were elderly men, two of them being very old. They spoke of the murder of Mr. Graves with the greatest abhor ence, and declared their willingness to give up the murderers; but declared also tliat they must be supported by a suitable force to effect their arrest, as they were influential men.' They said it was well known that the murder had been committed by (1) Malik Ghind bin Shahbeg, who had actually struck the blow which killed Mr. Graves, (2) Lulla bin Shahbeg, a brother of No. 1; (3) Shah Mahomed bin Gulbeg ; and (4) Shukrulla bin Sabi. They were asked how they knew this, and in reply stated that a man named Sherdad, a camel -herd of Shah Mahommad, No. 3, had openly declared that his master and the others named were the murderers and had boasted of having killed a Eeringhee. 166. The three headmen were questioned at considerable length about the position of affairs in Kirwan, and explained that there were three sections of the tribe to one of which the murderers belonged, iheir statements were written down, but were not recorded on oath, and at the conclusion they were told that they could leave the camp, as they had come in on the condition that they were free to c^me and go whenever they liked. 167. The interview with Mir Esa and the three Kirwani headmen took place on the 21st, and on the previous day a party of 30 blue-jackets from Her Majesty Service, the Laywing, under Lieut .-Commander Carr, C. M. G., had joined the Resident. The accounts he received from Captain Sykes on the further side of the river pointed to a large gathering of Kirwanis, and he thought it advisable therefore to increase the^party with him which, till the arrival of the sailors from the Lapwing, consisted of only 10 men of the Marine Battalion from the Lawrence. 168. After bis interview with the three Kirwanis on the 21st, the Resident decided to move his camp across the Bapch, as there were indications of rain, and had it fallen, it would have been difficult to communicate with the party who had crossed over with the Persians. He also sent Mr. R. P. Baker, C. 1. E., of the Telegraph Department, to trace the Bapch to the sea along its right bank with a view to moving our base from Galag to a point on the western mouth of the river, which might, he thought, be connected with a ne w camp on the right bank, where the line crossed the river. Ihe results of Mr. Ba er s examination, however, were not satisfactory, and Galag remained the_ sea base. No rain having fallen, the river had decreased steadily m volume instead of rising, and there had never been any difficulty in crossing it. 169. On the 22nd the camp was struck and moved to the right bank. Before crossing the Resident held a funeral service over the spot where the body of Mr. Graves was interred by his servants. They buried him on a small hillock, about 60 yards from the place, close to the telegraph line, where his camp was pitched at the time of the murder. The position of the grave was74 intended to be marked later on by a cairn and inscription on a slab let into concrete. This, when carried out, would, the Resident thought, be a suitable memorial to a deserving English official, and would also, it was hoped, serve as a warning to the natives of the country through which the telegraph line passed. 170. The Resident moved the camp to Gao on the 26th December, and had the country round carefully inspected. That night an attack was made on their position about 9 p.m ., but was repelled without loss. The arrange ments were in the hands of Lieut.-Commander Carr, and were all that could be desired. The following morning they moved through the gorge, and were able to cross the first range of hills, and see the valley beyond. 171. On the 27th a few date-trees were destroyed by the Persians, and it was intended to continue this work till the Kirwanis came to their senses and surrendered the criminals. The Resident, however, in the course of the day, (the 27th December) consulted the Persian Commander as to the advisability of suspending his operations, as he had received a communication from Said Khan, son of Hossein, the Baluch Governor of Persian Baluchistan, begging that the date groves might be spared for 30 days, during which period he promised to have the murderers arrested and handed over to the Persians. Hassan Khan was the tax-collector, the revenue having been farmed out to him by the Persian Government, and Said Khan anticipated heavy loss to himself if the Kirwanis were deprived of the means of paying their rent. 172. The Darya Begi declared that he was anxious to avoid depriving innocent people of their only means of subsistence and would gladly agree to wait. Said Khan was informed accordingly: but he took no steps to carry out his promise, and it seemed likely that his proposal was merely intended to gain time. 173. The operations against the date groves being temporarily suspended, Colonel Meade returned to the bank of the Rapch river on the 28th December. The 29th was employed in strengthening the camp in which he left Mr. Campbell, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, Mr. Graves* successor, with 12 sailors from the Lapwing under the gunner, Mr. Davis, and the 10 sepoys from the Lawrence. The rest of the parties, landed from the Figeon and Lapwing, were withdrawn, those vessels being required for the confiscation of arms bound for Persian ports, and Colonel Meade left Galag himself with Major Pagan for Maskat on the 31st December, arriving at that place on the following day. rn , ^ ^ ^ 4. ^ oi &lt;■ ivr vi iqoq Colonel Meade attributed the Colonel Mead s report, dated 21st Marcn 1898. n/rn , , murder ot Mr. Graves to several causes : (1) Desire of plunder : Mr. Graves was said to have had Rs. 1,000 in his possession, the pay of guards, etc. (2) There had recently been much ferment among the Baluchis and desire to throw off the Persian yoke ; hence disturbances and anarchy. (3) The British prestige had been at a very low ebb, otherwise murder of an Englishman would not have been attempted. (Ill) Detachment sent to Jask and Cliarfcar, January 1898. 175. In December 1897 the Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Sec. E, August 1898, N ob . 11—237. Department proposed that, owing to the No - 26 - revolt of the Baluchi tribes, Charbar was in great danger, and that a force of 50 men should be sent there. The British Charge d'Affaires at Teheran thought that the Persian Government would be unable to cope with the rising with their own forces for at least three months, and that as there was great danger threatening the telegraph, a party of 100 men of Native Infantry be sent to Charbar and 50 men to Jask with pro visions and equipment required for three months. Their withdrawal could • For earlier history, see Chapter VIII (i) and (iii.)75 be artanged to take place as soon as order was restored and satisfaction given for Mr. Graves' murder (Mr. Hardinge's telegram, dated 25th December 1897 to the Government of India). 176. With reference to this telegram, the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Viceroy on 27th December 1897— ' Can you send to Cbarbar and Jask the detachment of Native Infantry, and would the J guffice ? If not, what force would you suggest ? Have you any observation to make on th® policy which, having regard to British Indian interests, commercial, telegraph and political, it is desirable that we should consider or follow if matters in Persian Baluchistan came to n crisis ?' 177. The reply of the Government of India, dated 4th January 1898, was— ' We are prepared to send 100 men to Charbar and 60 men to Jask for protection of telegraph staff at those places. Above strength should suffice for purely defensive purposes. I oannot reply without further consideration regarding extent of British Indian interests in Persian Baluchistan, but effective military intervention or occupation couid not be attempted by the Government of India with the forces now at disposal'' 178. Onehundred rifles, 21st Bombay Infantry, were accordingly sent from Bombay for Charbar and 50 for Jask, on 9th January 1898, under the command of Lieut. Creagh and Lieut.-Waller, respectively. 179. Mr. Hardinge telegraphed on 20th January 1898 that he had agreed to the transfer to the Rapch of such No». 75—76. Indian troops as could be spared from Jask and Charbar, and that he proposed at Colonel Meade's urgent request to authorize him to employ a party of Indian sepoys in supporting Persian troops in destruction of the property of the tribesmen, because Mr. Graves' murderers had not been surrendered. The Government of India replied on 21st January approving of the employment of Indian troops to guard the telegraph camp on the Rapch, as it was understood that the presence of the telegraph officer there was unnecessary ; but at the time they informed Sir A. Hardinge that they could not agree to Indian troops being used to enforce against the offending tribe the authority of the Persian Government or to carry out punitive measures for which the Persian Government toere responsible. 180. The detachments at Charbar and Jask were reduced to 80 men at each place in April 1898, as the situation was * ' 0 * * improving (Eesidents* telegram to the Government of India, dated 30th April 1898). 181. When Sir A. Hardinge mentioned to the Mushir-ed-Dowlah the fact of the move of our troops to Jask and Charbar, and the intended despatch of a portion of them to the Rapch river, the latter remained silent and raised no objection to our proceedings. (IV) Unauthorized action of Commander Baker of the ' Sphinx ' in landing a force at Gutaf in Persian territory and proceeding with it to Rapch in February 1898. 182. The facts of this incident are as follows : The Persian Government . having sent a force to exact reparation for Sec. E, August 1898, Nos. 11-237 (No. 228). ^ of Mr&gt; Gray e S , and the tribes having assumed a threatening attitude, a request for the landing of an armed partyIfor the defence of the telegraph station at Hapch was sent, at the instance of Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Teheran, by the Resident at Bushire, to the Commander of Her Majesty's ship Hedbreast, on the 9th February 1898. A force of 29 men with a machine gun was in consequence landed at Galag and proceeded to Rapch, under Commander Eraser, of Her Majesty's ship Cossack. 183. On the 12th Commander Eraser telegraphed from Rapch to Com mander Baker at Jask, stating that he learnt from Mr. Campbell, the telegraph employe, that the Government of India had objections to the employment of British troops for anything but defensive purposes, that the Commander of the Persian force on the spot intended to recommence on the 14th the cutting down of date trees as a punitive measure, that the Baluchis were collecting in considerable numbers, and if the Persians suffered a reverse, reinforcements76 would be desirable for the safety of the British camp. He therefore requested permission to land more men from Her Majesty's ship JBigeon and his own ressels, both of which were at Galag. 184. Commander Baker thereupon telegraphed to the Resident at Bushire stating that he was going to Galag at once, and asking to hear whether the Resident thought that Captain Eraser's suggestion for landing reinforcements should be carried out. 185. The Resident replied that the ' Persian Government have directed the Persian Commander to remain on the defensive pending the arrival of reinforcements, so no further force seems neccessary at Rapch at present.' This telegram, however, was unfortunately not treated as urgent, and did not reach Commander Baker till after his arrival at Rapch. 186. Commander Baker arrived at Galag early on the morning of the 13th, and finding no telegram from the Resident, and the weather being favourable, proceeded to land a force of 13 officers and 145 men. 187. After landing he received a telegram from Commander Praser at Rapch to the following effect:— 'Kesident has telegraphed to Legation that he considers that, for purely defensive purposes, present party at Kapch is sufficient. Legation has replied that they are of the same opinion, and that if Persians are not sufficiently strong- to carry out punitive measures, they had better await Asaf-ed-Dowleh's arrival or further reinforcements from Bushire. Am going- with Campbell to see Deria Beghi and ascertain from him what he proposes to do. ' 188. This message is given in extenso as Enclosure 4 in Commander Baker's report; but in his comments upon it in paragraph 7 of the report. Commander Baker entirely ignores the latter part of it, which clearly pointed to his endeavouring to obtain some further information as to the Persian Commander's intentions before proceeding further. 189. On the contrary. Commander Baker marched the force on at once to Rapch and arrived there, ''after an arduous match,' at 6-SO p. m . On his arrival, Commander Eraser told him that at 2-30 p.m . he had been officially informed by the Darya Beghi, that orders have been received^from the Persian Government that he was to act on the defensive. This was confirmed about half-an-hour afterwards by the arrival of the telegram from the Resident already mentioned. Commander Baker observes : 'The purport of this telegram was absolutely clear, and if it had been received by me at Galag, the reinforcement w^ould not have been sent on to the camp.' 190. Nevertheless, Commander Baker proceeded to urge the Persian Commander that same evening to disobey his instructions, and to recommence punitive operations at once, promising him the protection of the British force. This will be seen from the following telegram despatched by him to the Resident, of which he does not appear to have forwarded a copy to the Admiral :— ' Sphinx/' Rapch, to Resident. Dated 14th February 1898. ' I spoke to Darya Beghi last night, and proposed to him that he should at once proceed and cut down trees now that there was so large a force in British Camp, and that in the event of his doin^ so 1 promised that I would cover his proceedings and retreat if necessary. He said he would be willing and anxioos to do so if it were uot for the orders he had received oa the 12th telling him to remain in camp, and he is quite impressed with our force here. ' Cannot something, therefore, be done to at once force the Persians to move ? ' As long as I promise hira my present naval support, lie will be satisfied, and events would, as far as our party is concerned, be in my hands. I should, of course, take every precaution not to take any initiative. This, I feel firmly convinced, is the most favourable opportunity that has yet presented itself, and it should not, if there is any reality in the wishes of the Government, be allowed to pass. ' The position of inactivity, in as far as the naval force is concerned, and their continued absence from their ships, would not, in my opinion, meet with the approval of the ^laval Commander-1 n -Chief. ' Captain Creagh and Mr. Campbell have both informed me that, in the event of defensive operations being continued, that the detachment of sepoys is ample for defence of camp, and that the blue-jackets are not required; therefore, I feel it my duty, if this state of affairs remains, to communicate my views to the Commander-in-Chief. ' The naval force is at present here nominally to protect the Persians.•'I 77 191. In reply the Political Resident referred Commander Baker to previous instructions and requested him to withdraw his party to the ships, which he did. 192. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty conveyed to Commander Baker through the Admiral an expression of their approval of his conduct based entirely on his own report of his proceedings, without any reference to the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and for India as to the information which may have reached them on the circumstances. In commenting upon these facts, Lord Salisbury considered the course taken by the Lords Commissioners as unusual and inconvenient. His Lordship felt bound to express his opinion that, although Commander Baker might have been justified in landing a force at Galag considering the state of his information at the time, his decision to march on at once to Rapch after receiving telegram from Commander Eraser pointing to delay required further explanation, and that his subsequent advice to the Persian Commander seemed scarcely defensible. Commander Baker's statement that the naval force was sent nominally to protect the Persians was altogether erroneous. It was. Lord Salisbury stated, landed for the protection of the employes and line of the Indo-European telegraph, and this was in fact the justification for resorting to such a proceeding as landing troops in the territory of a friendly State (Foreign Office to Admiralty, dated 12th May 1898.) (V) Further operations against the insurgents and punishment of the murderers. 193. Apart from operations conducted by the Persian force sent from Bushire, the Persian Government ordered See. E, November 1898, Nos. 560 600. Asaf-ud-Dowlah, Governor-General of Kerman, to conduct in person operations from the north against the Baluchi Ohiefs, first against the rebel Chiefs in Eastern Baluchistan, and, secondly against the Chiefs who had been concerned in the murder of Mr. Graves. Owing to the local failure of crops, their operations were unexpectedly prolonged, but they finally proved' successful. The eastern frontier was occupied by Persian troops, and Sardar Husain Khan, the leader of the malcontents, fled to the Mechan hills with a small following. His son was made a prisoner, and later on Sardar Husain himself was captured, 194. The Kirwanis of the country in the neighbourhood of Rapch river, who were immediately concerned in the murder of Mr. Graves, seeing that further opposition was useless, made, as we have seen, advances to the Persian Commander, offering to take measures for the arrest of the murderers. The four principal men concerned in the murder were brought to book in the follow ing manner:— (1) Malik Ghind bin Shah Beg, who is said to have struck the fatal blow, was hunted down and shot. (2) Shah Mahomed bin Gulbeg, whose crime was brought home to the satisfaction of the Persian Judges, was made prisoner and executed publicly at J ask in the presence of the local headmen. (3) Shukrulla Beg voluntarily surrendered himself and remained a prisoner at J ask. (4) Lulla bin Shah Beg was at large for a long time. But his son was seized and held as a hostage. • * (vi) Indemnity for the murder of Mr. Graves. 195. Her Majesty's Government thought it fit to demand from the Persian Seoret E., November 1898, Nos. 660-600 (Nos. Government indemnity for the murder of 570-673). Mr. Graves as a compensation for his family to the amount of £5,000. The Persian Government objected to this demand on the ground that Mr. Graves lost his life when discharging his duty to the Government of India and that they should provide for his heirs. Mr. Hardinge, the Charg6 d'Affaires, however, pointed out tuat Mr. Graves' death78 occurred in Persian territory where anarchy had prevailed for twelve months and was directly due to this state of things ; that, moreover, the Persian Gov ernment have guaranteed the personal safety of Telegraph employes of the Indo-Telegraph Department in Article 2 of the Anglo-Persian Telegraph Convention of 1872, ^vhich was renewed on 3rd July 1887 and which provides : that the British employes of the Telegraph Department, being charged with public duties, shall be pverywh^re placed under the special protection of the local authorities who shall furnish guards when necessary and otherwise assure their personal security/' [ Mr. Hardinge's note to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, dated 10th March 1898.] 196. It could not be denied that the Persian Government, however lax at Ibid No 561. ^ rst, a ^ er Mr. Graves' murder unusually energetic measures to restore order in the Eastern provinces, and in view of their great financial difficulties, Sir Mortimer Durand thought it inadvisable to press too energetically the claim for compensation of £5 5 00u. The Persian Government considered the claim excessive and were likely to repudiate all responsibility for the future maintenance of Mr. Graves' family (Sir Mortimer Durand to the Foreiffn Office, dated 1st June 1898). (vil) Rewards to Persian Officers for services rendered in Mr. Graves' murder case, 1898-99. 197. In his letter, dated 18th October 1898, Sir Mortimer Durand, Secret E., May 1899, No.. 142-169. eulogising the work done both by the imtish and Persian officers in the pro ceedings connected with Mr. Graves* murder case, recommended that the valuable services rendered by Mirza Ahmed Khan, the Darya Begi or Admiral, who was in command of the Persian force at the Eapch, and General Latfullah Beg, should be suitably acknowledged by the bestowal of an order or presents. The Government of India preferred the latter and offered to meet from the Indian revenues a total charge not exceeding £200, on that account (despatch No. 47 (Sec.-Extl.), dated 16th March 1899). They submitted, however, that the British Government should not bestow on any Persian officer a mark of appreciation of his conduct in the case, unless or until the Persian Government had discharged their obligations in the matter of compensation. 198. Sir Mortimer Durand reported that, in spite of repeated applications, he had failed to get any compensation for Mr, Graves' widow from the Persian Government. Their view of the case ^as that they had spent much money and taken much trouble in getting the tribe punished. But if Her Majesty's Government insisted on payment, he had little doubts that the Persian Gov ernment would pay. There was at the time no reason to withhold payment of the rewards, until the Persian Government had discharged their obligation. The Darya Begi especially had acted very enersetically and shown a most friendly spirit. He was a rising man at Bushire, and it was desirable to secure a continuance of his friendship. 199. The Government of India expressed as follows on this matter Secret E., October 1899, Nos. j53 -54 (No. 182 (feec.-Extl.) dated 28th Septem ber 1899):— ' 18 proposed to drop altogether the demand for payment of the indemnity to Mrs. Graves, there seems, in our opinion, to be no ieason why the rewards in question should not be independently given. But we earnestly hope that this com&gt;e may not commend itself to Her Majesty's Government, more especially in view of Sir Mortimer Durand's statement that, it lier Majesty s Government insii-t upon the payment of compensation, he has little doubt that the Persian Government will pay/ ' 200. Her Majesty's Government decided that the claim for compensation Secret E. f April 1900, Nos. 33-43. to Mrs. Graves should not be abandoned, hut that the issue of the rewards should not await the payment of the compensation. It was accordingly decided to spend £200 on purchase of a sword and a Lee-Metfcd rifle (with 4,000 cartiidsres) for presentation to the Governor of Bushire and Lutfullah Khan respectively. ^ From the demi-official correspondence in the collection noted in the margin it would appear that it was very unlikely that the claim for compensation would be pressed very much,79 CHAPTER XII. Changes in payment of Telegraph subsidy. Settlement of outstanding claims of the British Indian Subjects against Perso-Baluch Chiefs. Arrest of the remaining two murderers of Mr. Graves. Detachment at J ask and Charbar. Deaths of several Chiefs. 201. The above matters form the subject of an interesting report of Mr. Sealy, dated 17th June 1899. and the Besi- Eiternal A, February 1900, Nos. 18-19. dent 's remarks thereon. Tbe correspond- ence is therefore printed in extenso below:— No. 171, dated Bushire, the 12th November 1899. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the despatch, marginally noted, which I have No. 114, dated 11th November 1899, and addressed to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, «nc osures. submitting reports from Mr. Sealy, the Officer in Political charge of the Mekran Coast, and Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, on the subject of redistribution of the Telegraph subsidies paid to local Chiefs, and other matters dealt with by him during his visit to Charbar in M arch last. No. 114, dated Bushire, the llth November 1899. From—Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Fars and Khuzistan, To—His E xcellency S ie H. M obtimeb D tjband , K .C.S .I., K C.I.E., Her Britannic Majesty's Envoy ExtrHordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of His Majesty th« Shah of Persia, Tehran. I have the honour to forward, for Your Excellency's information, copies of the marginally x- no t» j.i T i oon noted letters addressed to me by Mr. G. Sealy, No. 93-P., dated 17th Jtrne 1899. Director of the Persian Gulf Section, Indo- No. 126-P., dated 18th August 1899, European Telegraph Department, on the subject (») of the annual payment of presents by the Telegraph Department to the Chiefs of the Persian Mekran Coast; {ii) of the arrest of the remaining two murderers of the late Mr. Graves, and (m) of the settlement of the outstanding claims of British Indian traders against the Chiefs of the Mekran Coast- 2. On the subject of the payment of presents to the local Chiefs it does not appear necessary for me to make any remarks. The proposals for the redistribution of the subsidies were framed and submitted by Mr. B. T. Ffinch, the Director-in'Chief of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, who approved of them, the Government of India concurring, and Mr. Sealy has by now received from Mr. Ffinch intimation of his approval of the distribution of the presents he made amongst the various Chiefs and headmen in December last. 3. I would, however, endorse Mr. Sealy's remarks on the subject of the impropriety of the Geh subsidy going indirectly into the treasury of the Persian Governor of Bampur, as this payment is quite distinct from the subsidy of 1112,000 paid annually by the Telegraph Department to the Persian Government, and was intended to be the direct reward ot th« local Chief for the protection of the line passing through his territory. I would recommend that the Persian Government be told that they have no right whatever to expect to receive any portion of this subsidy and that the Telegraph Department will only pay it, distributing it amongst such of the local headmen as it thinks will further its own interests best, when satisfied with the manner in which the latter are performing their portion of the compact made with the Department. 4. A report which, however, requires confirmation has just been received of the death of Sardar Husain Khan of Geh at Serbaz. This, if true, coupled with the facts ofMohim Khan's death some months a^o and Mowladad Khan's death more recently should tend towards the pacification of Mekran, and Sardars Said Khan and Abdi Khan should now be able to establish themselves more firmly in Geh and Dashtyari respectively. 5. In regard to the effecting of the arrest of the remaining two murderers of Mr. Graves, I would venture to enquire whether the Persian Government cannot be moved to take stronger measures towards this end than they have done since the return of the Darya Begins expedition from Mekran, and would express the opinion that if they would now offer a reasonable money reward for the capture of the two men it would not be long before it was satisfactorily effected. 6. For the settlement of the claims of British Indian traders which are still outstanding and which are referred to in the 37th paragraph of Mr. Sealy's letter No, 93-P., dated the 17th June 1899, I would suggest that the Persian f rovernment might be pressed to depute a representative of higher rank and greater authority than the Maymoor who met Mr. Sealy in March last. A Karguzar or other official under the Persian Foreign Office might, I think, more conveniently be sent down by sea to meet the Director at Charbar or Jask during the next spring with full instructions to settle every case presented to him by the latter officer. 7. In conclusion, I would specially invite Your Excellency's attention to Mr. Sealy's remarks in paragraph 89 of his letter No. 93-P., on the subject of the permanent retention of escorts at the Telegraph stations of Jask and Charbar. I am of opinion that so long as any possibility of a recurrence of troubles exists amongst the Mekranis, the detachments of the 21st Bombay Infantry now protecting the Telegraph stations referred to should not be withdrawn. No. 93-P., dated Karachi, the 17th June 1899. From—G. W. S baly, Esq., Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Persian Gulf Section. ■' , 11 i To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I &gt; I have now the honour to submit, for your information, my report regarding the following questions which had to be settled by me on the Mekran Coast in conjunction with a Persian official who was to have met me at Charbar last year ; — (1) The redistribution of the telegraph presents among the Perso-Baluch Chiefs and headmen of the Geh and Dashtyari Districts ; (2) The arrest of the remaining two murderers of the late Mr. Graves ; (3) The settlement of the outstanding claims of the British Indian traders against the Perso-Baluch Chiefs. 2. With reference to the first question, I have the honour to state that the Persian official was unable to meet me at the date arranged, but after consulting with you at l^ushire in Pecember last, I held Darbars at Jask and Charbar and met most of the Chiefs and hekdmen and informed them that owing— (1) to the unfortunate murder of Mr. Graves in the Karwan District last year; (2) to the failure on the part of the Chiefs of Geh District in affording proper protection to the telegraph lines, etc., in that district, and (3) to the misbehaviour of the Chief of Dashtyari in cutting the telegraph wires at Kedj and otherwise giving a great deal of trouble to us, the British Government had decided that the payment of subsidies for the protection of the telegraph lines would be discontinued and that in future ' presents ' would be given to those Chiefs and headmen who actually own^d lands along the root of the telegraph line and who were able and willing to protect it and the Government telegraph employes from injury. A Persian translation of paragraph 2 of your letter No. 81^, dated 12th December 1898. was then read over to them, after which the terms of the draft agreement (Appendix No. 1) were fully explained to them in Persian and Baluchi. The assembled Chiefs and headmen agreed to the terms and willingly signed the agreements. The Darbars were brought to a close by giving refreshments to the Chiefs and headmen and presenting them with pieces of broadcloth and flasks of gun-powder, supplies of which had been previously obtained from vour Tohshakhana. i 3. The following are the names of the various Chiefs and headmen who met me - - - . . ■ . ; Jask District. 4. Mirs Ali and Mustafa Khan, who are in charge of the telegraph line from Jask to Jagin and Jagin to Sadesh and receive a monthly subsidy of Rs. 30 and Rs. 40, respectively. The new arrangement does not affect these two Chiefs. In consideration, however, of the satisfactory protection of the telegraph line and the good order which they maintained in their districts during the late disturbances, presents of Rs. 120 each were given to them, the money being taken from the Rs. 600, the sum set apart for the pay of the Native Assistant or Newswriter at Bampur,81 Geh District. 5. All the headmen of the districts between Sadesh and Charbar, a? per statement No. 2, with the exception of the last two, viz., Esa bin Sher Khan and Hote Fakir Muhammad met me at Charbar and signed agreements. '1 he agreements with Esa bin Sher Khan and tlote Fakir Muhammad were completed by Mr. R. Can pi ell later on during' his trip to Jask, when all the headmen received their first instalments of the telegraph presents in advance for the half-jear ending 3Oth June 1899. 6. A.t the beginning of la«t year it seems that Sardar Said Khan and Mowladad Khan were appointed by the Persian authorities, Joint District Officeis or Chiefs of Geh. But as this arrangement was considered unsuitable it was proposed lhat there s-hould be only one district officer of Geh and that the appointment should be given to ^ardar Said Khan, son of Hussein Khan, and that he should receive a yearly present of l&gt;s. 1,000 as Chief of the Geh District, provided he effected the capture of the two remaining murderers of Mr. Graves and afforded etiicient protection to the telegraph line passing through his district in conjunction with ti'e headmen above mentioned. 6. With reference to your question about Sarfaraz Khan, there is no record, as far as I am aware, that he was ever appointed District Officer of Geh by the Persian authorities; but there is no doubt he is the de facto proprietor of that district. 7. Said Khan, however, did not meet me on my visit to Charbar in December ISOS, but arrived there in March 1899, and on being iniormed that a Persian Mamoor was shortly expected to meet me there to settle outstanding claims against the Geh and Dashtyari Districts, he left ( harbar a couple of days previous to the Mamoor's arrival. The Mamoor and I wrote to Said Khan asking him to return to Charbar, but he f-xcused himself on the plea of beings engaged assisting the Sartip of Bampur in collecting revenue at Serbaz. 8. There will, I am afraid, be some difficulty in persuading the Chief of Geh (whoever he may be), to accept the Es. 1,000 yearly present for protection of the telegraph lines as both the Mamoor and Mowladad Khan (who accompanied him) distinctly informed me that the Chief of Geii c&lt; uld not accept any reduction in the amount originally paid tbis Chief without the express permission of the Governor-General of Kermau. 9. It seems that the whole sum of Ks. 3,000, which was formerly paid to the Chief of Geh by the Telegraph Department, has for some years been paid by the Chief to the Persian Gov ernment, In fact the lease of the Geh District, which is renewed each year, includes this sum aa an item of revenue, and the Chief apparently derives no benefit whatever from the subsidy. 10. This state of affairs, no doubt, accounts for the apathy shown by the Chief of Geh in looking after the telegraph lines, property of telegraph employes, etc., in his district. 11. In connection with this I would beg leave to point out that the Persian Government receive from the Telegraph Department R 12,000 as an annual subsidy for the telegraph line passing through Perso-Haluchistan from Gwetter to Jask and that the subsidising of the Baluch Chiefs of Bahoo, Dashtvari, Geh, and Jask was an arrangement made with them per sonally by Sir F. Goldsmith in 1869 for the protection of the teiegraph line in their respective districts, and -was no concern of the Persian bovernment. 12. If the Persian Government would now relinquish their claim to the Geh subsidy I think matters would shape themselves and the Chief of Geh, whoever might be, would gladly accept the Rs. 1,0U0 yearly present offered and fulfil the conditions we require. 13. Owing, as you already know, to the non-fulfilment of the conditions of the-agreement entered into with the Baluch Chiefs by Colonel Sir F. Goldsmith the present change in the redistribution of the subsidies was made for the better protection of the telegraph lines and sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India, Telegraph despatch No. 7, dated 19th May 1898, a copy of which was supplied to you last year. 14. Statement No. 3 shows the claim of the Telegraph employes against the Geh District which were settled last year under instructions contained in your telegram, words 16, dated 23rd March 1898. Note. —Since settled, vide accompaniments to') 15. Statement No. 4 gives the claims which Mr. Campbell's letter No. 31, dated the 5th June &gt; are still outstanding. 16. Statement No. 5 shows the total amount of Geh subsidy withheld since 1897, and of the expenditure debited to it and the balance in hand. 17. The Chief of this district, Mir Abdi Khan by name, is a prisoner with the Persians at Kerman, and as this man gave us a great deal of trouble it was decided and approved by yon that the subsidy of Rs. 1,000 yearly for the protection of the telegraph lines should be redistri buted as follows 1898. Dashtyari District. Mir Mahmud Khan (Abdi's brother) to receive . Haji Mnbammad . Shai Muhammad . Syed Muhammad . TOT AS . 1,000and that these four men should be held jointly responsible for telegraph lines and protect employes, etc. The fir-t instalment of their presents for the half-year ending 30th June 1899 has already been paid to them. 18. When discussing the question of the 'British Indian traders' claims against the Dasht - yari District with the Persian Mamoor at Charbar, Mir Mahtnud Khan refused to have any' thing to do with the matter and asked that the agreement Utely entered int &gt; w^th him mio-ht be cancelled. As Sardar Mowladad Khan, the District Officer of Da-htyari, appointed by the Persian Government, taid he would settle all these claims if w^ gave him the Rs. «()0, and as Mahmud Kiian persis:ed in his refusal to settle the claim, the agreement with the latter was cancelled. A fresh agreement wa^ then entered into with Mowladad Khan, who with the three headmen mentioned above, is now responsible for the telegraph lines, etc., in this district. 19. With reference to the Rs. 300 alnady paid to Mahmud Khan for the half-yearly period ending 30th June 1899. I think Mahmud Khan should be allowed to retain the money for t-ervices previously rendered. 20. As the redistribution of the Dashfyari subsidy between Mahmud Khan and the others was a matter which was fai ctionfd by yourself and the Director-in-Chief, 1 venture to think there will le no difficulty in obtaining the Secretary of Suite's approval to this arrangement. 21. Statement No. 6 shows the claims of the Telegraph employes settled last year against this district. 22. Statement No. 7 claims still outstanding, and 23. Statement No. 8 shows the amount of subsidy withheld and expenses debited to it and the balance in hand. Bahoo District. 24. The Chief of this district, Mir Ashraf Khan, son of the late Sardar Muhammad Ali, having satisfactorily protectpd the telegraph lines in his district during the Mekran rising, his yearly present of HI,000 has been continued. 25. As a special case, however, a portion of his subsidy or present to be used in payment of money owed by him and the Baluchis of his district to the estate of the late Guru Uttamdas. A separate report on this case has been submitted to you. 26. With reference to the second question, the arrest of the remaining two murderers of Mr. Graves, 1 am afraid this matter must stand over until the Chief of Geh is permitted to accept the yearly pre-ent of S 1,000, unless, of course, it is considered advisable to offer money rewards for their capture. 1 think, however, this is the duty of the Persian Govern ment, and they should be urged to take steps for the arrest of these men. 27. With reference to the third question the settlement of outstanding Briti-h Indian traders' claims, 1 have the honour to state that the Persian Mamoor, Ya&lt;ri Khan Yawur accompained by Sardar Mowladad Kl.an, arrived at Charbar on the 13th March where I met him on the 18th March. 28. A month previous to the expected arrival of the Mamoor, notices were issued to the British Indian traders having claims against the Perso-Baluch Chiefs to present themselves and witnesses at Charbar. 29. I had expected that the Mamoor would have been empowered to settle all the pending cases, but as already reported to you by telegram, only those cases which related to the Dashtyari District could be gone into as the Mamoor informed me he had no instructions or power to discuss the others. 30. Sardar Mowladad Khan agreed to settle up all ela : ms against this district on the condition that 1 could assure him of the release of Mir Abdi (his son-in-law) for whose good behaviour in the future he has promised to stand surety. 31. The Mamoor's first proposal was to take all the claimants into the Dashtyari Distrn t and recover the amounts due to them from the varione Baluchis and pay them there, but as theie was no guarantee that this would be done, I object* d, after some discussion the matter rf the payment of these claims was arranged through the Customs farmers at Charbar, provided the release of Mir Abdi was guaranteed. 32. As, however, I could not give this guarantee the matter having to be referred to the Minister at Tehran, I left Charbar for Karachi on 3uth March leaving the final settlement to be carried out by Mr. Wilson, the clerk in charge, Charbar, who bad full instructions how to act. 33. The Mamoor and Mowladad Khan le^t for Sirgan a few days after I left Charbar and returned there on the 12th May when the Mamoor wired to me saying that as he and Mowladad Khan must proceed to Biampur before the hot weather, they were willing to settle the Dashtyari claims in anticipation of Abdi's release. 34. Your reply to this communication that claims might be settled ir dependently of the condition of the release of Abdi, was conveyed to the Mamoor and the claims as per statement No. 9 were then settled. 35. The settlement of the claims as per statement No. 10 were promised by the Mamoor after further enquiry at Dashtyari, the claimants not having come into Charbar. The Mamoor and Mowladad Khan left for Dashtyari and Bampur on the 14th April 1899,36. It will be seen from this report that a full settlement could not be effected with tbd Mamoor as the Mamoor was not empowered to act except in the matter of the Daslityari daims and even these would not have been settled if it had not been for Sarder Mowladad Khan. The Mamoor to all appearance left everything to Mowladad Khan and did only what Mowladad Khan suggested. 37. A number of old cases and those received after submission of the list to you are still in abeyance against the Geh and Uashtyari Districts. Besides these the three principal cases, viz.— r (1) The Gwetter murder case (see correspondence ending with teWram, words 70, dated 18th • uly 1898) ; (2) The Dizak abduction case (see correspondence ending with letter No. 91-P dated 17th May 1897) ; '' (3) The unlawful seizure of property of a British Indian trader by Mir Adam of Pishin (see correspondence ending with your letter No. 363, dated 12th July 1-80 4?^ y could not be settled as the Mamoor had no power. 38. As it is important that all these cases should be settled as early as possible, I would suggest that the Persian Sartip of Bampur with full powers to deal with every case should meet me when 1 next visit the Mekran Coast and to facilitate matters would suggest that full enquiries be made on the spot in every case and the report kept ready for this official's arrival. 39. In conclusicn, I would beg to point out that the detachment of troops stationed at JasJc and Charhar have had an excellent effect on the country in general, and that, as there now appears to be no objection on the part of the Persian Government to the presence of these garrisons, I would suggest that they be permanently established, and as these troops afford protect,on both to the Telegraph Department and to the British Indian traders, I consider that the cost of maintaining them there should be borne equally by the Telegraph and the Political Departments. 40. I am happy to remark that the Mekran Coast u^der my charge has so far escaped infection from plague. The people of Mekran have suffered a great deal from the last three years' drought, but since the heavy rainfall in February last, I am glad to say, there appears to be every hope of the condition of the country improving. Large number of Baluchis from the Coast and interior flecked to Karachi during the last six months, but many are now returning to their homes. -P.S.—Since the above was written the Clerk in charge, Charbar, has reported that Sardar Abdi Khan has been released by the Persians and arrived at his village in Dashtyari in May last. No. 1. AGREEMENT. I do hereby agree to afford all protection within the District of of which I am the Chief (or as the case may be) to the telegraph line passing through the said district and similarly to afford all protection and assistance to tho Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, Persian Gulf Section, his Assistants and men while permanently or temporarily living in or passing through the said district; the aforesaid officers and men shall be protected by me from any ill-treatment at the hands of the natives, and I further agree to give them every facility in the discharge of their duties should they apply to me for same. In consideration of my agreeing to afford the protection and assistance aforesaid, the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, has agreed and does hereby agree to compensate me by giving me a present annually of Rs, payable by two instalments, viz., one in the month of April and the other in November. Should I, the said fail to carry out my part of this agreement and should thereby the telegraph line be damaged or the Telegraph officials and men be ill-treated or looted in my district, not only shall I not be entitled to receive the present as stated above, but the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, sihall be entitled to make good from the amount of the said present any loss or damage that the telegraph line or he or his officers and men may incur through my failure to abide by this agreement and he shall be at liberty to withhold the present until such time as he thinks fit to renew it. Dated this («..••••••&lt;••CHAPTER XIII. State of the Districts thron^li which the Telegraph line passes from Gwettar to Jask, 1003-1904. 202. The following report sent by Mr. J. 0. Twells, Assistant Superinten- t* . Tn^ion. at i. dent to the director of the Persian Gulf ' f . ' S ' Telegraphs, dated 28th March 1904, about the state of the districts through which the telegraph line passes from Gwettar to Jask will be read with interest as the most recent official account giving us a history of the internal affairs of the country for 2 or 3 years previously. Baku District —The Chiefs of this district are Sardars Ahmed Khan and Ashraf Khan who jointly carry on the work, collect the revenue and pay the taxes yearly to the Governor of Kerman. Bahu was till a few years a^o a most flourishing district, but owing- to scarcity and the oppression of the Chiefs, the inhabitants have lelt the country and gone to India, a great number settling in Karachi. Till last year the only men of money and property were the Maids (fishermen) and Lattis (owners of cattle and cultivators) who were the main support of the Chiefs. The former resided at Gwettar and left last year for Jewny owing to the Chiefs' looting them. Not satisfied with what they had taken at Gwettar and being annoyed at the men leaving the district, Ahmed Khan with the concurrence of the Nazim of the Mekran proceeded to Jewny and again looted them. The men were compelled to borrow the money demanded, and seeing they could get no protection at Jewny, have now settled down in Gwadur. The Lattis also left Bahu at the same time as the Maids and for a short time stayed at Ankara in the Sultan of Maskat's territory where the Chiefs were unable to molest them. They then came to Dasht and settled down there till the early part of this year. I hear they have now left Dasht and are on their way to JLus Beyla, where they originally came from. About the beginning of the year Ahmed Khan ambushed some Lattis and their slaves who went to their fields in the Bahu district to graze their cattle. They were taken prisoners and only released sometime after on payment of a large sum of money by the tribe. Their cattle and slaves being confiscated. Since my arrival at Jask I hear these Chiefs have turned away the Customs Official at Gwettar after severely beating and ill-treating him, but I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this statement. The Chiefs complain that since the port has been taken from them, their revenue has decreased considerably and no reduction is made by the Governor of Kerman who in fact demands extra money. 3. Dashtyari District. —At present under the joint control of the brothers, Sadars Abdi Khan ana Mahmood Khan. This district has for years been in an unsettled state owing to quarrels between the brothers in consequence of which the petty headmen and ordinary Baluchis of any standing were quite out of hand, some siding with Abdi and others with Mahmood Khan. The brothers were constantly making raids into each others districts; this led eventually to indiscriminate looting in which British Indian subjects suffered considerable losses. I pointed out to the brothers there was sufficient room for both of them in the district if they would only come to an amicable understanding and work too-ether. This they have now done, and one of Mahmood Khan's first acts was to notify all headmen that robbery in the district was to immediately cease and any one found molesting British Indian subjects would be severely punished. It was not long before he had occasion to carry out his threat and two men of the Hot tribe died from the effects of injuries received for attempting to rob a British Indian trader on bis way to Dashtyari from Charbar. Of the brothers Mahmood Khan is the stronger man. He is hasty of temper and quick to take action and commands both respect and fear. He is also supported by his cousin, Sardar Said Khan, whose help he can always rely on in an emergency. British Indian traders informed me that all robbery has ceased in the district and their property is now quite safe. 4. Gaih District.—Sardar Said Khan is the Chief of the district and the strongest and most feared Chiet in the Mekran. He and his father before him have been the Chiefs oJ Gaih for many years. About two years ago the country was taken from him and made over to Sardar Mohim Khan. He then proceeded to Kerman, and on largely increasing the sum the district is yearly farmed for, was re-instated. On resuming charge about the middle of last year, his first act was to seize, plunder and destroy property of the adherents of Mohim Khan. As the sum of money he has promised the Governor of Kerman cannot be obtained by legiti mate taxes, he has had to have recourse to tyranny and oppression and to such an extent as has never been known before. On his visit to Binth he looted all the men with any property and I hear some British Indian subjects also. He moves about with a large armed following and is thus able to enforce his demands. He was the first to introduce selling as slaves the lower and poorer class of Baluchis. They are sent to the ports of Tank, Galag and Sadeeh where boats from the Arabian Coast call solely for the purpose of taking away slaves. Need less to say his example is being followed by others. The proceeds of this traffic in slaves is used to a great extent in importing guns from Maskat. The Henry-Martini is being discarded for the magazine rifle, Lee-Metford pattern. I will now deal with the small districts, the headmen of which are paid by us half-yearly. Parag, Sirgan and Kir Districts. —The headmen are, respectively, Hots Fakir, M oh am ed, Sher Mohamed and Bhai Khan, The former has incurred the displeasure of Said Khan for86 not sending liim his magazine rifle whieli lie wrote and asked him for. He has taken away the district and imposed a fine on him, I advised Fakir Mohamed to give up the gun, but this he declined to do. Sher Mohamed and Bhai Khan appear to be harmless and inoffensive men and the district is quiet. The latter asked me for protection from Said Khan. I told him I could give him none as he was not our subject and the present he received from us was for work required of him. Bir District. —Nominal headman Mir Syudullah, but the work of the district is carried on by his younger brother, Sheroo and his uncle, Sahih Khan. An attack of brain fever three or four years ago has affected him, and he is not in his right mind. He is very rarely in his district but keeps knocking about and is allowed to do just as he pleases. Mir Halao, a relation, is claiming a part of the present drawn by Syudullah on the srounds that he shares a part of the Customs of Tank and has a voice in the administration of the district. He would not have dared to put forward this claim had Syadullah been in his right mind. He has done trifling damage to the line and imprisoned and ill-treated the line guards son. He is also responsible for the loss of 15 goats belonging to the line guard who has been compensated for this loss. Tank is the port of the district. A Customs Official, Mr. Mirza Yantz, landed there about three years ago to take over the Customs. Syudullah refused to give it up and ordered him to leave at once or he would attack him. The official left, threatening to send a force and take him prisoner. No further action seems to have been taken by the Persians. There are no British Indian traders there. : 1 he port is the centre of the gun and slave trade; slaves being brought here from all parts of the country. No doubt the headmen get a percen tage of the proceeds. Karwan District. —The headmen drawing presents are Mirs Alae, Dost, Gool Mohamed, Shahsowar and JEsa Sherkhan, who are jointly responsible for the safety of the line and Government servants. These headmen took upon themselves to protect the line in the Ballak and Bandeni districts, but I am afraid have undertaken more than they can perform. The country appears to be quiet. The ports are Gralag, Rapch and Sadech. Slaves in large numbers are brought to these ports from Binth Gaih and latterly from Bashkard, guns are also imported. J ask District. —Under the joint control of Mirs Mustapha Khan and Hotee, * Mustapha Khan's younger brother, Barkat takes an active part in the management. The taxes used to be paid to the Governor of Bushire, but since the introduction of the customs, they pay no taxes. In this respect they are better off than the Bahu and Dashtyari Chiefs. The slave trade is increasing yearly. Barkat informs me that during the past three years about 450 slaves have been shipped from here to the Arabian Coast. He says he has now stopped this traffic by killing the ringleader, one Shai bin Shaban, his reason being that Shai captured two Bashkardis in his district which he objected to. The real reason, however, is Shai discontinued bringing in slaves to Jask and took them instead to Sadech where they fetched a higher price. Barkat would only allow Shai to sell the slaves brought in to a few chosen men with whom he had an agreement that half the profits derived from the sale were to be paid him. All the Martini-Henry rifles in possession of Shai were supplied him by Barkat. Barkat wrote to Shai to come in to make some other arrangements about slaves. Shai sent him in 19 slaves and came in shortly after. He was well received and entertained, but during the night was treacherously attacked, 12 men being killed. Shai himself escaped to Jagin; Barkat attacked him there and killed him and about 25 of his followers and captured 27 men, women and children with all their property, money and arms. These have all been sold by Barkat who retains as his share about 4,000 dollars. This appears to be a large sum of money, but con sidering he sold 49 slaves at an average of 150 dollars each, I do not think the amount has been much exaggerated. There are still eleven of Shai's followers at large and these men may give trouble later on. I hear Barkat is in communication with another Bashkardi named Hoosein to bring in slaves. I cannot vou^h for this, but will know in the course of a month or so if there is any truth in the report. There is another gang of nine men at Gabreeg under the protection of Mir Noor Mohammed, a brother of Mustapha Khan, who brino- in slaves from Bashkard. * 5. The reason there is such a demand for slaves from these parts is that the trade from the African Coast has been effectually stopped and Baluchistan is the only place now open to them. 6. The rainfall this year has been very good and there should be no scarcity in the country, the date crop also promises to be very good. •Mir Ali, Mir Hoti's father died in 1900. (Ext. A. July 1900 No. 21).87 CHAPTER XIV. Gwadur and Charbar Affairs. (i) Early History of Gwadur and Charbar. 203. The traditions of the people of Mekran carry us back to a time when Memorandum on Mekran by Captain E qbs , the country was governed hv rulers, called 1868 &gt; Maliks (Arabic for kings or princes). They were supplanted in the 17th century by the Boleydis, a tribe of Arab descent long settled in Baluchistan. One of their great kings was Shah Eilar, who from an inscription at Gwadur appears to have reigned at Kej about the year 1729 A.D., at a time when Eastern Persia was under the rule of Afghan conquerors, soon to be wrested from them by Nadir Shah, 204. Within ten years of the last mentioned date, the Boleydi dynasty had to make way for the a Panjabi or Rajput family, whose rise synchronizes with the establishment of a form of religion called Zikreeism in Mekran. Their great chief was Malik Dinar. 205. In 1739 Mekran was conquered by the Generals of Nadir Shah, but soon after his death in 1747, the Baluchi Chiefs re-established their independ ence, and there arose among them a new power in the Chiefs of Khelat, that was to exercise paramount influence in Eastern Baluchistan. The old Bolevdi families in Kej invoked the aid of Nasir Khan of Khelat against their conquer ors the Gitchkis. The latter were forced to submit, and a peace was agreed to between Nasir Khan and the Gitchki Chief, Shah Omar, under the terms of which, the Gitchkis were allowed to remain in possession of their territory on condition that half the revenues of the districts they held were to be paid over to the agent or Naib of the Khan appointed to reside at Kej. 206. The parts of Mekran including Gwadur and Charbar having passed through all these changes of Governments of the Boleydi, OitchU, the Khelat Chiefs and of the Ferdan kings, whenever the last were powerful enough to extend their sway almost to the confines of Sind, as was the case during the reigns of Shah Abbas and Nadir Shah, we should not be surprised to find pretensions of successors of these chiefs and kings to rights in Gwadur and Charbar, in varying degrees even in our times. 207. In addition to these, the Sultans of ; Maskat made their influence felt on the Mekran Coast, and became masters of the Towns of Gwadur and Charbar. Elying from the pursuit of his brother Seyyid Said, Seyyid Sultan sailed in 1784 from Oman to Gwadur on the Mekran Coast, from whence he proceeded to Khelat, to implore the protection of Nasir Khan. The latter dismissed him with the grant of the village and half the revenues Gwadur, to which the Khelat State was entitled to. Whether the grant was in perpetuity, or merely temporary, there is no contemporary evidence to show, but the Sultan of Maskat has held the place since the date of the grant with hardly any interruption. 208. Seyyid Sultan remained at Gwadur from 1784 until a reconciliation had been effected some years later with his brother Said, when he felt it safe to return to Oman. 209. When Seyyid Sultan came to power in 1798, he despatched Wali Saif bin Ali to occupy Gwadur in his behalf and to build a fort. In accord ance with further instructions received from Seyyid Sultan, the Wali surprised and took possession of Charhar. 210. We have here briefly traced the origin of the pretensions of Persian monarchs, the Seyyids of Maskat and the Khelat chiefs to rights in Gwadur and Charbar. Eor more detailed accounts we must draw attention to the extracts from reports and correspondence Rev. Mr. Badger's report No. 9, dated referred to in the margin and quoted 28 and so. above Recently there have been put for- Captain Rosss report para.47. ward claims of the Gitchki family and also the Jam of Bey la in connection88 with the question of the rendition of Gwadur to Khelat. The correspondence is summarised below in Section (V). (ii) * Azan bin Ghia's attempts to take Gwadur and Charbar, 1869-70. 211. when Azan bin Ghias succeeded to power in Maskat in 1869, he sent as his Governor to Gwadur one Seyyid Sait' who quickly disgusted tbe people by his fanatical Wahabeeism, that wlieu Nasir bin Thoweni an illegitimate son of Thoweni by a Baluch woman, made his appearance at Gwadur in a fishing boat, in which he had left Maskat secretly, the people welcomed him, and turned out Seyyid Saif. Charbar was little later quietly occupied by Din Mohamed Zudgul of the neighbouring town of Dashtyari. 212. Resenting this subversion of his Lieutenant's power, Azan bin Ghias Political A., Ma, 1869, Nc. 234-212. contemplated the despatch of a force by sea to expel Nasir, but (the practice of the British authorities at that time being to prevent naval operations, not only in the Persian Gulf, but for some distance outside) w r as prevented by Colonel Disbrowe, the Political Agent at Maskat, who put an interdict on any armed vessel leaving the harbour. And, very soon after this, Nasir felt himself strong enough at Gwadur to u ,... , i T 1Q „ 0 AT ocn mediate an attack by sea on Azan bin Political A., Jnne 1869, No. 360. i . t, 4. u i n/r • Ghias at Maskat, but was told by Major Ross, the Political Agent at Gwadur, that this could not be permitted. 213. Azan himself had, in September 1869, heard, falsely, from Bombay o t at ^ that the British Government had permit- S. I,, 1870, Nos. 40-41. ted Sey . d Ma . id of Zailzibar; t0 move against Oman, and wrote to Colonel Pelly, urging that the permission given to one should apply to the other, so that he should be allowed to attack Gwadur. Colonel Pelly replied that his orders were to prevent by force if necessary any naval operations. 214. Similarly, in November 1869, Din Mohamed, of Dashtyari, asked permission to attack Maskat. He was S. I., 1870, Nos. 38-39. reminded of the previous orders of Govern ment in the matter. 215. In December, Azan returned to the charge, and wrote to the Resident saying that the sea was properly free to all; that his predecessors had not been prevented from proceeding by sea to any of their territories beyond sea, but that he now found himself prevented from putting his hands on tne terri tories which belonged to him beyond the sea. ' If ', he said,— ' the prohibition (to move by sea) is to be with our consent, we will neither consent nor act up to it. But if it is to be compulsory, and not according to rules and justice, then of course we cannot help it, and will leave it to God. But we do not think that a great and powerful Government as the English, will enforce such prohibition without just cause.' Colonel Pelly laid the matter before Government, expressing an opinion which he repeated more fully in his letter s. I., 1870, No. 146. 0 f 23rd April, summarized further on (in paragraph 217 of this Precis). It was settled in Council that the matter should— ' he over till Azan was recognized, and that the whole question should then be reviewed for submission to the Secretary of Stated 216. In the end of January 1870, Abdul Aziz, a younger legitimate son of Seyyid Said, who had been with his elder brother Seyyid Turki in Bombay left that place in a native coaster, and made his appearance at Gwadur. He was invited ashore by Nasir and seized ; but Nasir thought it better to deport than to keep him in confinement, so, at the suggestion of Major Ross, the Political Agent, sent him off in the mail steamer to Bushire, wither it had been his avowed intention to proceed when he left Bombay. He made an attempt to land at Bunder Abbas, but was prevented by Haji S. L, 1870, Nos. 248A.-219. Ahmed Khan, the Governor, on account of his proceedings at Gwadur. * laken from Mr. Buckland's Precis.89 217. In his letter No. 57-25, dated 23rd April 1870, forwarded by the Bombay ^Government in No. 168, dated 12th May, Colonel Pelly reported a conversation between himself and Abdul Aziz, and said :•— ' I did not prolong the conversation regardins: Gwadur, because I was sensible that it might lead to questions on the Syud-'s part presenting some logical difficulties. For instance the sole right which Syud Nusseer has to Gwadur, consists in his having crossed the sea from Maskat and occupied the place. We have tacitly allowed the fact, although we should have prevented Syud Nus-eer, had we found him at sea. Suppose then, what m the sequel is probable, that Syud Azan, or some of his feudatories, shonli in like manner slip accross the Oman Gulf and expel Sjud Nusseer, we should by parity of argument have either to acknowledge the new intruder, or else to expel him from a portion of what he deemed his territory. ' Again, if we should persist in declaring that Gwadur had ceased to belong to Maskat the question as to whom it does belono- misrht assume an inconvenient political aspect. For if Gwadur, Charbar, and the Mekran Districts in general, hitherto dependant on Maskat, do not belong to Maskat, to what State do they belong? Khelat claimed them of old ; Syud Nusseer holds them since last year; Persia, pretends to them apparently under the erroneous impres sion that the de jure Empire of the present tshah is conterminous with that of Nauir. ' If once we assent to Persians eastward encroachments, based on such pretentions, or if once we consent to disturb a long acknowledged political status in favour of some distribution of territory which may have existed between the fall of Nadir's Empire and the consolidation of our, I apprehend reiterated, political change would follow, and that we might eventually find Persia, or those for whose ultimate interests she acts, claiming a frontier contiguous with that of the Indus Valley. ' My respectful counsel to Government would be to attempt an amicable solution of the Gwadur question, whereby Gwadur and the other heretofore Mekran possessi&lt; ns of Maskat should continue to be considered an integral portion of the Ma&gt;-kat. State, and the Governors of those places, whosoever they may be, to be considered subordinate to the recognised Sultan of Maskat, whosoever he may be. ' A solution of this character would in my opinion be comparatively easy, immediate and likely to endure, whereas, to acknowledge a Sultan of Maskat, and to inform bim that that actnowled^ment did not include the Mekran Districts, would, in my deferential opinion, irritate the Ruler acknowledged ; would not be understood by the tribes of Oman, or indeed by the Native in general; would probably result in an attempt on the part of Maskat to recover their dependencies by surprise ; might render our Telegraph Stations on the Mekran Coast liable to inconvenience; would afford Persia an opportunity for fresh intrigue ; and would, in the sequel, perhaps result in the Ma.&gt;kat Sultan recovering, without our consent, that which in my deferential opinion, many reasons, whether of expediency, policy, or equity, now point towards our conceding with a good grace.' 218. The views of the Government of India in the matter were expressed in Secret despatch No. 31, dated 27th May 1870:— ' It only now remains that in fulfilment of the promise made in paragraph 16 of our despatch of 2'2nd February, we should communicate to Yonr Grace our views regarding the claim of Azan bin Ghias to the occupation of Gwadur, and other places on the Mekran Coast. ' In writing to Colonel Pelly on the 16th of December last, Azan bin Ghias m^ade the following remarks : 'We have territories (abroad) belonging to ourselves and the Arabs, but we cannot put our hands on them and we do not understand what is your object in regard thereto. If the rules laid down for the Arabs, the same on which our predecessors acted, are still in force, then we can go (by sea) to any of our territories we may wish. If the prohibi tion (to move by sea) is to be with our consent we will neither consent nor act up to it. But if it is to Ido compulsory, and not according to rules and justice, then of course we cannot help it, and will leave it to God. But we do not think that a great and powerful Government as the English will enforce such prohibition without just cause. ' ' Colonel Pelly assumes that the complaint relates to ' the territories of Gwadur, Charbar, - d i i • i. etc., on the Mekran Coast.' These territories, ^Colonel Goldsmid B Frecu on Baluchi.tM., a(Jds ^ Rcsident; h „ c hi( . herto been atkttow . 0 ' lodged by us as being included in the dominions subject to the Sultan of Muscat. To the best of our knowledge no territory, or territories on the Mekran Coast, beyond the limits of the two ports of Gwadur, and Charbar, has ever in recent times been held or claimed by Maskat. ' Gwadur, we would observe, was granted towards the close of the last century to Syud Sultan, who usurped the throne of Maskat in 1797. He had fled after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the power of his brother, Saeed bin Ahmed, to Khelat, the Khan of which State made over Gwadur, then a fishing village of no importance, for his support. He and his successors have, despite various efforts of the Baluchis to regain it, never lost their hold on the place, and from time to time fortifications have been added, which have increased in strength. In the time of the same Syud Sultan, Charbar was taken by surprise from the Baluchis, and has ever since been retained by the Arabs. In virtue of the extension of the Persian dominions under Nadir Shah, which included the whole of the Mekran Coast the Shah's Government has never ceased to lay claim to those two towns. Colonel Goldsmidtwho is intimately acquainted with the history of Baluchistan, has, after a careful investiga tion of previous correspondence, declared his conviction that the Shah has no claim to either one or the other. The Imam's tenu-e of Charbar is acknowledged by the local Chief's, who receive from him a portion of the revenues in order to protect the port from attacks of tribes in the interior. The Balnchis deny the free gift of Gwadur to Maskat, and say that half only of the revenues were assigned. Bnt at all events the Imam monopolized the whole and has retained them, in I86.1-66 the Governor of Kerman admitted to Colonel Goldsmid that he had nothing to say to Gwadur, and tiiat he bad little power on the sea coast. In the Telegraphic Convention of April 186^, the territorial rights of Persia in xMekran were purposely left; undetined. Article II merely grunts a subsidy for leave to lay down a line of Telegraph 'on those parts of coasts and places which are under the sovereignty of Persia. To judge by his remarks at pages 21 and 22 of his precis, Colonel Goldsmid, whilst excluding Gwadur, would include Charbar as matte'- of expediency within Persian limits, if the boundary question ever really came under settlement. The uninterrupted tenure of both ports by the State of Maskat, however, constitutes, in our opinion, strong argument against enter taining any absolute claims which might be raised by Persia or Khelat. Were we once to admit that the former miirht if she could recover what she possessed in Nadir Shah's time, or the latter what Nuseer Khan held, there would be the strongest inducement to encroach ments, which w.mld certainly end in insecurity, and probably in war. As regards Baluchistan and Afghanistan, we have consistently aimed at maintaining the status quo, and to depart from this endeavour at the present juncture would be, in our opinion, to inaugurate a most disastrous policy. It will be in Your Grace's recollection that, in the Telegraphic Convention of 1865, we distinctly admitted that tnere were places in Mekran -ubject to the sovereignty of Syud Thoweynee. Again, in February of last year, after Azan bin Ghes had establifhed himself in Maskat, and at the time when the Governor of Charbar had actually been summoned by him to his side, we sanctioned the grant to Ma,skat of Rs. I,o00 a year for concessions at Gwadur and Charbar on account of our land line of Telegraph j and when the Minister of Azan bin Ghes enquired from our Political Agent at Maekat concerning our doings at Charbar, he received for answer that we were acting in pursuance of a formal agreement with the Maskat btate.'' The conclusion of the Government of India was as follows:— Havins: thus repeatedly recognised the ports of Charbar and Gwadur as integral part 8 of the Maskat dominions, we should not hesitate, in the event of the formal recognition of Azan bin Ghes, to use our good offices to procure their restoration to him from his relative^ Nuseer bin Thoweynee,' 219. The Bombay Government had not at first expressed an opinion in Political A., December 1870, Nos. 2.9 — 221. mattei, but did so in theii letter No. 192, dated 3rd June 1870, concurring with Colonel Felly's counsel, and saying :— ' As to our future policy with regard to Gwadur, whenever a firm rule is established in Maskat, and has been acknowledged by us. His Excellency in Council is of opinion that our recognition should be cmplete and should extend not only to the possessions in Onun, but to the possessions in Mekran, vvhich have undoubtedly of late years belonged to Maskaf. If the pres nt state of affairs continues there, it is highly probable that tiie claim of Persia may be acknowledged or enforced. His Excellency in Council thinks she would hesitate to quarrel with the acknowledged Ruler of Maskat.' The Government of Bombay added that Abdul Aziz was a weak young man who, having pretentions of his own, and thinking that, if Seyyid Turki succeed ed, he would be eclipsed, would deprecate Seyyid Turki's prospect of success. 220. This letter was sent to the Secretary of State in continuation (No. 118, dated 24ith June 1870), and the Bombay Government was told that the ques tion of the policy of the British Government as regards Gwadur had been referred to the Secretary of State.

And the Bombay Government concurring said, in their letter No. 1725, dated 23rd June 1871, that the necessity of settling this question made an early recognition of Seyyid Turki more important. That recognition the Government of India had been empowered to bestow by telegram of 7th June 1871 from the Secretary of State. And in the letter (No. 1238-P., dated 16th June 1871), in which authority to take the necessary action was conveyed to the Bombay Government they were told that— 'tlie Political Agent should be careful to make no reference to the former dependencies of Maskat on tlie Mekran Coast/' If Seyyid Turki referred to the matter the Political Agent should merely answer that he had received no instructions from his Government on the point and should send on any representations that Seyyid Turki might make concerning them. To this letter then the Government of India now referred the Bombay Government. 222. On t the 18th of September 1871 the Bombay Government reported t Proeeediugs, Political, October 1871, Nos. b y telegraph that Seyyid Abdul Aziz was 552.553. suspected of an intended move, and that Captain Miles had reported that Aziz was making preparations for a start to „ , - j 0 ...

With reference to the foregoing events, the Bombay Government was asked to ascertain through Colonel Pelly whether Seyyid Turki was apprehen sive of any danger from his brother (No. 2038-P., dated 26th September 1871, Proceedings, Political, October 1871, No. 556). In reply. No. 5123, dated 25th October, the Bombay Government said that the Political Agent did consider Abdul Aziz dangerous to Turki. 224. In the mean time the Commissioner of Sind reported by telegram 11 Telegram, dated 15th October 1871 (Proceed- that beyyid Abdul A zlz |j had again ings, Political, October 1871, No. 557). left for Charbar with 20 followers, and •* Tefegrani 0 fnmfBombayf 'dated 2®th October that he had been promised assistance by i m . s Hussein Khan of Gaih. f This expedi tion ** was also given up, Aziz for the 2nd time returning to Gwadur. 225. On the 29th October 1871, the Bombay Government sent on a tele gram from Colonel Pelly, saying : ' Syud Toorkee having expressed immediate apprehension of Syud Abdool Azeez landing on Oman Coast in communication with Ibrahim bin Ghes, I crossed to Mekran Coast and found Abdool Azeez returned from Charbar to Gwadur and apparently without funds. I suspect Syud Toorkee's fears are worked on by his Minister Thoweynee from personal feelings. All was quiet on SiSth/' 226. In No. 4999, dated 18th October 1871, the Bombay Government sent on a translation of a letter from Din Mahomed, the Zudgal Chief of Dashtyari, in Mekran, to Seyyid Turki showing that, in August, Abdul Aziz had written to Khaia Ismail, the Governor of Charbar, and directed him to take the customs and to discontinue the allowance granted to Din Mahomed Zudgal. He had fur- ther ordered that Din Mahomed should not be permitted to enter the fort. Dm Mohamed, however, managed to forestal his order, and having gained access to the fort, informed Seyyid Turki that, tt From Political Agent, Maskat, to Resident un i ess jjg reC eived orders to the contrary, in Persian Gulf, No. 467, dated 11th August 187 fcc should, if need arose, fight f t Seyyid Abdul Aziz. Shortly after this, one Mahomed Ali of Baho (cousin of Din92 Mahomed) reported that Abdul Aziz had called on him to furnish 300 men to attack Din Mahomed, and lie offered to place himself at Turki's disposal in view to preventing Aziz's march. 227. The Political Agent* at Maskat, who was consulted on the matter, ^ 1A . i w i? m advised Seyyid to discountenance Din * From Pohncal Agent, Maftkat, to Kesident in , i &gt; t i Persian Gulf, No. 467, dated nth August 1871. Mahomed s pioceedings, and not to accept the services which the Baluch Chief swere thrusting upon him, as it would be both unbecoming and impolitic for him to be forced into a premature rupture with Abdul Aziz. When this came to j - v ^ ^ j oq . u * Colonel Felly's notice, he toldf the t In o. 946-947, dated 28th August 1871. i . i „ Political Agent that when a reference was made to him concerning the districts of Gwadur, etc., his best plan would be to say that he had no instructions in regard to those places, and therefore could not commit himself to any opinion. Colonel Pelly at the same time drew the Agent's attention to paragraph 4 of the letter from the Government 4.otat c^o * .o*. India to the Bombay Government, t s. I. No. 863.Of 1871. No 123 8-P.{ dated 16th June 1871, wbieh requested that the Agent at Maskat might be instructed to be careful to make no reference to the former dependencies of Maskat, or the Mekran Coast, or to Bunder Abbas, or to the Zanzibar subsidy, as no orders could be passed on these subjects, till the views thereon of Her Majesty's Government were received. 228. The Bombay Government with its §No. 4999, dated isth October 1871. forwarding letter§ drew attention to our No. 1238-P., and remarked that— ' it would be of great advantage if the present Sultan of Maskat were placed in the same position as regards both Mekran and Bunder Abbas as his predecessors. 229. In the meantime|l Turki had addressed the Political Agent, and, after observing that he had taken his 1 ugus ' ' advice with reference to Din Mahomed's proceedings, suggested that as Abdul Aziz held Gwadur and Charbar without his authority, the British Government should turn him out. Seyyid Turki said that he was loath to take this step himself, as he did not wish to disturb the country. On this occasion the Agent carried out the instructions contained in Poreign Department letter No. 1238-P., dated 16th June )871, 'which had been sent to him through Colonel Pelly •D' Vide letter, dated 22nd August 1871. with regard to the answer^F to be given •* To Bombay Government, No. 1018—268, o, . , rr-, i • i tj ii„ dated 12th September 1871. to Seyyid Turki.

When he reported ft Turki's tt No. 499. dated 22oa August 1871. request, the Political Agent said ' I believe this is the first official statement of the present Governor of Maskat disavowing the authority of Seyyid Abdool Azeez at the places referred to. 'The latter left Maskat with the knowledge of His Highness for Gwadur, but he was allowed to proceed, I think, because he was considered dangerous here.' The Political Agent also suggested that the Commissioner in Sind should be acquainted with the whole case, and instruct his Assistant on the Mekran Coast accordingly. 231. The Bombay Government, when it transmitted the above news, , ^ observed tt that as Seyyid Turki had been tt No. 5121, dated 2ath October 1871. • j o i c n/r i ± u • recognized as Ruler ot Maskat, his power should be consolidated. With this object in mind, it recommended the removal of the restriction which prevents Turki sending vessels and men to Gwadur and Charbar. It was further of opinion that— ' the whole matter might be settled if the gun-boat Hugh Hose were sent to G wadur, and an intimation made to His Highness Abdool Azeez that we recognized Gwadur as the possession of the Sultan of Maskat.' The presence of the gun-boat would also, the Bombay Government thought, prevent any attempt on the part of the Aziz to cross over and join Ibrahim bin Ghias.93 S 232. In reply to the letter, forwarding this intelligence, and submitting ^ the Mbove mentioned su^srestion, the Government of India said, No. 2537-P., dated 7th December 1871 :— .-cyr /■ ' The Viceroy and Governor-General in Council does not see that the British Government o are in way called upon to interfere in this matter. The recognition of Syud Toorkee as liuler of Maskat by no means implies that everything' that belonged to Maskat in the time of his predecessors should be considered as now under His Highness's rule. His Excellency in Council would hesitate to send the gun-boat Hugh Rose to Charbar or Gwadur for the purpose proposed. It would no doubt be advantageous if Syud Toorkee could consolidate his rule; but it is neither incumbent on the British Government, nor would it be expedient to make a demonstration of force with a view to help him to do so. His Excellency the Governor General in Council has done all in his power to procure for Syud Toorkee the release of Bunder Abbas from the Persian Government. In regard, however, to Gwadur and Charbar, which were formerly parts of Maskat, but apparently are at present governed independently by Abdool Azeez, His Excellency in Council does not think it advisable to interfere to establish Syud Toorkee■'s rule there and put down Syud Azeez any more than in Sohar, which appears to be somewhat similarly governed by Ibrahim bin Ghes. ' The Governor-General in Council concurs in the opinion of the Bombay Government that Syud Toorkee ought not to be prevented from sending vessels and men to Gwadur and Charbar. His Excellency in Council has no desire to prevent Syud Toorkee from putting to sea, with a view to establish his authority in any part of his dominions that may be situated outside the Persian Gulf/'' (iv) * Persian pretentions to Gwadur and Charbar ; Demarcation of boundary line between Persia and Rlielat: Capture of Charbar by the Persians. ^33. In the course of the correspondence of 1869 regarding the encroach ments of Persia in Mekran, the Persian Government distinctly and repeatedly claimed Gwadur and Charbar as Persian possessions. 234. The instructions of the Government of India to General Goldsmid for his guidance in the demarcation of the boundary between Persia and Kbelat in Mekran contained the following passage regarding the possessions of Maskat on that coast: — ' His Excellency in Council does not think it desirable that the question of the Persian claims to Charbar and Gwadur should be taken up. It would be impossible indeed, for such a question to be settled by a Commission on which the Maskat (Government is not represented. In the unlikely event, therefore, of Persia pressing the consideration of her claims to these two sea-ports, or Khelat claiming Gwadur, you will content yourselt with recording fully the grounds on which the claims rest, and will inform the Commissioners that no opinion can be given on the subject except after communication with the Government of Maskat/ 235. General Goldsmid, writing from Gwadur on the 13th April last used the following expressions ;— 'I don't know whether the many changes among the late Kulers of Maskat have influenced or not the policy of the Arabs of Oman in respect of their isolated possessions on the Mekran Coast, but there is certainly a great want of authoritative Government at the ports of Gwadur and Charbar. At the former a Beluch is in charge, vyho was at one time a peon in Major Ross's establishment; at the latter, Kbwa I^mael, a Sindi by birth, but an Arab subject, is the Acting Governor. He appears a kind of Agent to the Persian autho rities inland. If there should be no actual understanding between the Persians and Arabs regarding Charbar, and I have never heard that there is any, there is at all eve '^ s 110 evident jealousy or ill-feeling at the visits of the former, even when attended by several followers. Captain Evan Smith said the red flag of the Arabs was left flying from the port of Charbar the whole time he was there engaged in discussion with the Persian Commission. 236.

I think, be preferable to the present undefined political condition. Jf (iwadur, for instance, belong to Khelat, ard were so acknowledge, neither Government nor the Khan of Khelat would permit persons there residing to threaten the Maskat toast. If, ngain, Gwadur be independent, Government in acknowledging its independence would probiiblj provide that its Huler should not aggress; and it, thirdly, Gwadur belong to Maskat, Government would probably provide that the Sultan should hold peaceful possession In his No. 656, dated 21st November 1871, Major Ros-', Political Agent at Ma»kat, reported 'that Hashid bin Hnmel, who was sent by His Highness Syud Turki to Oharbir, has returned from that port, having apparently been unsucces- ful in his mission. ' Letters have been addressed to me by Deen Mahomed Zudgul stating that the Surteep Ibra him Khan of Bampoor has written announcing his intention of taking possession of Charbar, and appointing Meor Hossain Khan to be Zabit. 'I understand similar communications have been made to His Highness Syud Turki.' the 13th November, asked the Bombay Government whether, when the boundary between the Persian and Khelat terri tories was arranged by General Goldsmid, the question of the possessions of the Sultan of Maskat on the Mekran Coast was inciuded and disposed of. 237. Thereupon the Bombay Govern ment, on the 6th December, recorded a ilesolution to the effect that no decision res pecting the right of the Sultan of Maskat either to Gwadur or Charbar was arrived at by General Goldsmid. In fact it was not in question, the boundary to be settled being that between Khelat and Persia. Maskat was not represented, and the rights of that State could, they said, not be effected. 238 By No. 2780-P., dated 28th December 1871, the Government of India expressed full concurrence in the observations recorded in the Bombay Government Resolution of 6th December, but remarked that it was undesirable that the Commissioner in Sind or the Officer of the Telegraph Department should make any communication to Ibrahim Khan on the subject beyond stating that they had no authority to hold communication with him on 'poli tical questions. And by No. 2781-P., of the same date, a copy of the correspondence was sent to Mr. Alison (enclosures 10-12 in despatch to Secretary of State, No. 8 dated 24th January 1872). 239. On the 24th January, Mr. Alison telegraphed to the late Viceroy : ' The Grand Vizier has received intelligence that the brother of the Imam of Maskat has taken the Fort of Charbar. His Highness observes that in deference to the wishes of Her Majesty's Government, Persia has waived her rights over the Khelat territory and accepted the frontier line laid down by General Goldsmid, That, according to this arran cement Charbar unquestionably belongs to Persia and that, as Her Majesty's Government have used their influence to limit Persian movements in Beloochistan, it is but reasonable to expect that the same influence will also be exercised in preventing encroachments upon Persian terri tory by the Imam of Maskat.■' 240. In reply, Mr. Alison was, by telegram of the 6th February, referred to the papers sent to him on the 28th December, and it was added ' The position of Maskat in reference to Charbar was in no way affected by the proceed ings of the Mekran Commission on which Maskat was not represented/' 241. He telegraphed again on the 8th Eebruary :— ''The Grand Vizier says that Persia is anxious to establish her authority along the whole the point in Gwuttur Bay. line of her coast starting wes* from the point* , . , , , marked down m General Goldsmid's map, that considering the readiness which she has always shown in acceding as far as possible to the wishes of her old ally, England, he hopes that Her Majesty's Government will in this matter afford their moral support/' 242. And the Government of India received Bombay letter No. 818, dated 12th Eebrnary, sending a report from Captain Miles, dated 2l8t Januarv to the Commissioner in Sind in which he reports 'Syud Abdool Azeez left Gwadur on Monday last, the 15th instant, with the professed intention of making a shooting excursion in the interior. When a few miles off, however, he embarked in a dinghy that was waiting and proceeded to Charbar, which was. held by A^hee, a son of Deen Mahomed, with only two or three men. The latter was quite unprepared for resistance, and none was offered, and Abdool Azecz took quiet possession of the Fort. Deen Mahomed has been sent for by his son, but has not yet arrived there. His Highness Abdool Azeez has been joined, a few days before he left, by four Arabs from Sohar bringing letters95 from Ibrahim, and I believe it is by their instigation that this enterprise was undertaken, as it was in their boat he embarked. No disturbances whatever have yet occurred.' In forwarding this report Sir W. Mere wether says :— 'A telegram from the Director, Mekran Coast, and Submarine Telegraph, mentions that Deen Mahomed and Abdool Azeez had come to terms. The former agrees to retire, and leave the latter in possession of Charbar, pending reference to the Sultan of Maskat.' 243.^ Lastly, the Bombay Government telegraphed on the 12th that the Commissioner in Sind had sent a telegram to the following effect:— ,f Captain Miles reports Ibrahim Khan writes to Abdool Azeez to come to Kussurkund to make terms; have told Captain Miles not to interfere pending instructions. 7 ' 24i4i. The following telegrams were then received :— From Political Secretary, Bombay, to Foreign Secretary, dated 22nd February :— 'Commissioner in Sind telegraphs :—Captain Miles reports, dated to-day, Ibrahim Khan * i.e., the Persian Governor of Kirman. expected at Charbar to-morrow or a day after.

Meanwhile the Viceroy desires that you will call upon the Persian Government to issu^ stringent orders to their local offictrs not to molest British subjects but to afford protection to them. 248. Colonel Peliy telegraphed on the 29tli, through Bombay, that Salim had landed on the Coast near Soor, and that the Maskat &lt; Jovernment were address ing Bombay, appealing against apprehended Persian seizure of Cliarhar. Colonel Pelly had heard from Mr. Alison that the Persian Government stated they had received no intelligence of the capture of Charbar. Mr. Alison reported that the Persian Government on the 3rd March had telegraphed orders for the full pro tection of British subjects at Charbar. 249.

The Grand Vizier wishes to impress upon the Viceroy that the Persian Government is most desirous and resolved to render full justice and redress to British subjects, and for this purpose he is taking the Shah's orders for sending a special Commissioner to Charbar, but His Highness begs that it may also be taken into consideration that the Persian Government is imperfectly^ informed of the late occurrences and of the nature of the aggressions made on British subjects and property. He reiterates the assurance that suitable redress shall be afforded in due time.'' This was considered highly satisfactory, and the Viceroy tlianked Mr. Alison for his prompt action, adding a hope that be wonld convey to the Persian Government expression of His Excellency's satisfaction with the assurances given. Captain Miles was requested to expedite enquiry into circumstances and extent of British losses. 255. The Bombay Government, on the 10th March, telegraphed :— &lt;e Following from Commissioner in Sind : — Mr. Walton telegraphs as follows ;— c Portuguese servant of Superintendent, Charbar station, fired on by Hossein Khan's men this morning when proceeding in boat to obtain provisions from bugla just arrived.

Government have been referred to, and instructions must be awaited/ ' In reply they were told that the Political Agent, Gwadur, had already been, authorized to take measures for protecting the lives and property of British subjects at Charbar. 256. On 12th March Mr, Alison again, telegraphed:— ' I am informed by the Grand Vizier that a special courier has been sent to the Governor of Kirman with orders to him to despatch a Commissioner to Charbar for the adjustment of British grievances. This officer may be expected to reach in about 2(1 days.' 257. The Secretary of State forwarded * to the Viceroy copy of a telegram * No. ii of 8tii February 1872. addressed by Mr. Alison to the Foreign No. 12 of 16th February 1872. Office, XiOndon : — ' Persian Government alarmed at the reported capture of Charbar by the brother of the Ruler of Maskat. Grand Vizier requests me to say that Persia is anxious to establish her authority along the whole line of Coast starting west from the point marked down in General Goldsmid's map; and that considering the readiness which she has always shown in acceding as far as possible to the wishes of her old ally, England, she hopes that Her Majesty's Government will, in this matter, afford their moral support.' The Secretary of State informed Lord Granville that the subject would doubtless be considered by the Government of India, and that pending the expression of the opinion of that Government, he was not aware of any reason for refusing the request of the Persian Government. 258. The Government of India wrote f t No. 17, dated 22nd March 1872. to ^ Secretary o{ g,,^ ._ 'In forwarding the papers as per accompanying Abstract of Contents, regarding the capture of Charbar by the Persians, and the plunder of British subjects residing there, we take the opportunity to reply to Your Grace's despatches No. 11, dated 8th, and .No. 12, dated 16th February 1873, on the subject of the Shah's desire to receive the moral support of Her Majesty's Government in establishing the authority of Persia along the coast west of the boundary line laid down by Major-General Goldsmid. ' From our telegram of 29th February to Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran, Your Grace will perceive that when we received from Mr. Alison a telegram to the effect that the Persian Government were desirous of our moral support in the annexation of Charbar we replied that as Maskat is a State in long and friendly alliance with British Government no aggression upon her by Persia, or any other Power, could be countenanced or encouraged. We also expressed our regret at the outbreak of hostilities and^ our willingness, if asked by botl). parties, to exercise our good offices in the amicable adjustment of their quaire . h' e we consider that we should not be justified in countenancing any aggression on the part of Persia against the Sultan of Maskat, we are not of opinion that the interests of India are in the least bound up with the possession of Charbar b}^ the Sultan, nor would we use our influence or intervention to promote the restoration of that place to the Government oi His mghnesfc.98 ' It will be seen from the papers now forwarded that Britisli traders at Charbar bave teea extensively plundered by the Persian advance force; and reduced almost to the verjje of starva tion. We have accordingly, and with a view to the protection of the Telegraph officials, moved Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran to call upon the Persian Government to prevent the recurrence of similar outrages, and directed that a jrun-boat be stationed in the harbour to keep watch, and, if necessary, afford a refuge to any British subjects who may claim protection. The claims of British subjects to compensation for the injuries inflicted on them have been reserved. a We have further requested the Bombay Government to instruct the Political Agent at Gwadur to proceed to Charbar with the gun-boat; to take all necessary measures for the pro tection of the lives and property of British subjects; to enquire into and report on the extent of the injury done to them; and to warn them to abstain from taking part in the quarrel, making it understood that he is not there for political interference, or with a view to the restoration of the place to the Maskat authorities.' 259. Captain Miles, Acting Assistant Political Agent, Mekran Coast, ♦ Enclosure of No. 1553, dated 13th March 1872, reported * In full on the taking of from Bombay. Gharbar— ' On the departure of the Wukeel-ool-Mulk for Bampoor from Kusserkund, Surteep Ibrahim Khan, who had accompanied him, proceeded on to Charbar, an advance force of his troops under Meer Hossein Khan of Gaih arriving there about midnight on the 21st instant. The fort of Charbar, which mounted four guns, was held by Syud Abdool Azeez with about thirty Arabs and Belooch followers. He resisted the Persians for about three hours when, finding, after the loss of several men, that defence was hopeless, he evacuated the fort and escaped to a boat in the harbour. ' It does not appear that Syud Abdool Azeez was called on to surrender, as the attack was made immediately on arrival of the Persians. Meer Hossein Khan states, however, that the Naib of Teez (a Beloochee) began without orders wishing to loot the place. ' Surteep Ibrahim Khan did not arrive at Charbar until the day after the capture, and left again yesterday for Kusserkund, after appointing Meer Hossein Khan in charge of the town. ' The British traders and other inhabitants had fortunately removed their families and most of their property from the town the day previous to the attack, as the Persians commenced plundering directly the fighting was over. The town ig still empty and great disorder prevails, the inhabitants refusing to return until the soldiers have left. The British subjects report their losses at between Rs. 1,300 and 1,400.' 260. On the 4th March Captain Miles submitted t Surtip Ibrahim Khan's t Enclosure Of No. 1783, dated 22ud March 1872, reply to his letter communicating the from Bombay. yiews of the Government of India regard ing Charbar. Ibrahim Khan wrote ;— ' It is incumbent on me to reply to what you have written regarding Charbar. It is not unknown to you that Charbar belongs to Persia, and has from ancient times formed part of the Mekran Coast. No one can say the Sultan of Maskat has any right to it. This was determined last year by the Commissioners appointed by Persia and Ji ngland. ' In this year Sultan Abdool Azeez has seized and confined in his vessel Ismail Ashoori, a servant of Persia, and two (Persian) merchants who were bringing goods from Maskat. ' I beg from your kindness that you will inform him (Abdul Azeez) that on account of this property, regarding which nothing has yet passed, he should not have seized a servant of Persia, and that he should send them back at once to Charbar, otherwise I shall be compelled in the same way to sieze himself and ship by sea, and in retaliation to plunder the Bunder of Gwadur, which belongs to Maskat.'^ 261. Captain Miles commented. 'The two Persian merchants, referred to in the latter part of this letter as having been siezed by his Highness Syud Abdul Aziz, have since been released, but the property and money taken from the buglaare still in possession of His Highness. The man Ismail Khoja Ashoori has been sent here for confinement in the fort, but I have not interfered to release him, as it appears very doubtful as to whether or no he is a British subject. ' No alteration has taken place in the state of affairs at Charbar since my last. Hossein Khan remains in charge, and Syud Abdul Azeez is still in his boat in the harbour watching his opportunity, u Some days ago a bug la arriving from Maskat was siezed on by Syud Abdul Azeez, and the sum of 800 Dollars, the property of Charbar merchants, taken out of her. She was then despatched to Soor to engage and bring over a number of men to assist him in his attack on Charbar fort. A boat was also despatched to Khaboorah about the same time for the same purpose. ' The traders at Charbar have taken refuge near the Telegraph station, being afraid to return to the village while the Persian authorities are there, and as their property is still detained by Hosseiu Khan, they are unable to leave the place as they wish to do/'99 262. The Commissioner in Sind remarked ; — 'The letter from Ibrahim Khan is most unbecoming and insolent, and his statement about Charbar uublushingly untrue. ' The man Ismail has at times, the Commissioner believes, claimed all nationalities as it suited him. Captain Miles has been requested to submit further particulars as to his previous history/' 263. On the 13th March the Bombay Government telegraphed :— ' With reference to your telegram of the 12th reporting Alison's. It seems to this Gov ernment that the position assumed by the Grand Vizier entirely ignores as to Maskat claims to Charbar. I think thnt it should be clearly understood that our action in no way prejudices this question, or the Persians will say we h;ive recognized their right in the same way that they pretend that the Convention of 1870 conceded Charbar to them by fixing Persian fron tier as regards Khelat.' * No. 659-P. This was answered* on 16th March sees no ground at present for interference between ' Your telegram of 13th. Viceroy Persia and Maskat in respect of their respective claims to Charbar. Bis Excellency thinks that the action of this Government should be restricted to the protection of British subjects and property. Copy of despatch received from the Home Government on this subject will be sent by post/' 264. The Bombay Government submitted (No. 1949, dated 30th March 1872) these observations :— (&lt; His Excellency the Governor in Council thinks that the assertion of Surteep Ibrahim Khan as to the question of the sovereignty of Charbar having been determined by the English and Persian Commissioners last year, should be brought to the notice of the Shah's Govern- ment. As has already been expressed to the tiovernment of India in his telegram of the 13th instant, His Excellency in Council is of opinion that care should be taken in all these proceed ings that there should not be the slightest foundation for its being said hereafter that the claim of the Persians hud been recognized in any way by us. It is necessary that this should be clearly understood, if only for the sake of our character in the Gulf, which should be above even the suspicion of bad faith, or our influence would rapidly decline.' t No. 878-P., dated 11th April 1872. 265. The Government of Inida had anticipated the suggestions and repliedt— 'On the 28th December last the British Minister at Teheran was informed that the rights of Maskat inCharbar were in no way affected by the Mekran arbitration. He was a^ain so informed by telegraph on the 6t ,h February 1872 : and in a message dated 29th he was told that as Maskat was a State in Ions' and friendly alliance with the British Government, no aggression upon her by Persia or any other Power could be countenanced or encouraged. ' The Government of India has further expressed its willingness to mediate between Per sia and Maskat in refevence to Charbar if requested to do so by both parties. There seems therefore, no room fcr apprehension that the good faith of the British Government can in any way be called in question. The present correspondence, however, will be forwarded to Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran.' 266. The Bombay Government in their letter No. 1962, dated 3rd April to the Government of India, stated :— ' His Excellency the Governor in Council is of opinion that it should be pointed out to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the boundary line laid down by General Goldsmid is a settlement as regards the frontier between Persia and Khelat, and in no way prejudices the claim of Maskat to Charbar, etc., or gives the English Government any right to aid Persia in possessing herself of territory which already belongs to another Power. It would be well, His Excellency in Council thinks, if this were intimated to the Persian Government, or they may, and probably will, declare that the absence of any such communi cation, after the request made through Mr. Alison, was equivalent to a recognition of their right.' 267. The answeri to the Bombay Government was, that, as intimated in Foreign Department No. 878-P., dated I No. 1014 P., dated 25th April 1872. 'April 1872, their suggestions had already been anticipated by the Government of India.100 268. Sir W.

Mirza Said Husain pievious to leaving Tiz for Maskat took away Husain Khan of Geh's subsidy guariirtee, said none of these people have right to money from British Government, believe Din Mahomed and others are to be taken away also ; under order, it is said, from Persia.' And in forwarding them he remarked :— 'That if something jis not arranged in regard to Persian appropriation of Maskat possessions on Mekian Coast, difficulties will arise in regard to protection of telegraph line/' 269. The Commissioner of Sind was told in reply:— ' As Gwadur is now protected both by Sir F. Goldsmid^s boundary and by the express abandonment by Persia of all claims to it. there are apparently no further possessions on the Mekran Coast for Persia to annex. Under these circumstances. His Excellency in Council does not at present anticipate any serious difficulties with regard to the protection of the telegraph line. Should you, however, still be of opinion tbit difficulties are likely to arise, I am to request that you will submit, for the information of His Excellency in Council, a special report on the subject, and suggest the measures you would propose to meet them/ - ' 270. On the 7th October 1874 i the Resident in the Gulf forwarded two Political A., Deoember 1874, Nos. 140-144. kbaritas from Seyyid Turki, addressed respectively to the Secretary of State and to the Viceroy and Governor-General upon the subject of the claims of Maskat upon Charbar, which His Highness was under the impression had come within the purview of the Commissioner appointed for the settlement of the Mekran boundary. The following is the purport of the kharitas :— To Marquess of Salisbury, Principal Secretary of State for India, dated 27 th Shaban 1291 = 9th October 1874. ' I beg to acquaint Your Lordship that when the Commissioner appointed by the British Government for the settlement of the Makran boundary arrived, and entered upon the duties, no one was present at that time who could advise on our behalf with him, and who could point out the places which belonged to us, and hence the country known as Charbar and belonging to us was apportioned to Persia. It is possible the Commissioner acted inadver tently in this, or that he was ignorant of the fact that the abovenamed country descended to us from our ancestors. Out of respect to your (Government we have hitherto refrained from asserting our rights to this tract (Charbar), but we are certain you would never consent to this {viz., that Persia should deprive us of our rights). ff Certainly the British Government and the Oman Government are one, and our trust in all matters is centred in you. Now our hope from the great Government is that the abovenamed tract Charbar will be restored to us and incorporated in our dominions as it has been of old. To remain silent regarding loss of territory and to be indifferent about it is improper. 'We place unbounded tmst in the British Government, and it was necessary for us to represent this matter to you. ' To Lord Northbrooh, Viceroy and Governor-General of India, dated 27th Shaban 1291=9tk October 1874. I beg to acquaint Your Lordship that when the Commissioner appointed by the British Government for the settlement of the Mekran boundary arrived, and entered upon his duties, no one was present at that time who could advise on our behalf with him, and who could point out the places which belonged to us, and hence the country known as Charbar and belonging to us was apportioned to Persia. It is possible that the Commissioner acted independently in this or that he was ignorant of the fact that the abovenamed country descended to us from our ancestors, out of respect to your Government we have hitherto renamed fiom asserting our rights to tlds tract (Charbar), but we are certain would never consent to this {viz., that Persia should deprive in our rights). Certainly the British Government and the Oman Government are one, and our trust m all matters is centred on you. Now our hope from the great Government is that the above- named tract (Charbar) will be restored to us, and incorporated in our dominions as it has been from of old. To remain silent regarding loss of territory and to be indifferent about it is improper. 'W e place unbounded trust in the British Government, and it was neces sary to represent this matter to you.' 271. In reply the Political Agent was instructed to acquaint Syud Turki that there was— no foundation for the idea that the part of Charbar was apportioned to Persia on the setulemeut of Mekran boundary, Charbar was excluded altogether from General101 Goldsmith's consideration by definite instructions on the express ground that Maskat was not represented on the commission. The proceedings of the Crmmisdon in no way affected any matter in dispute between Persia and Maskat. The Political Agent should remind His Highness that on a former occasion the British G( vernnunt declined to interfere in respect to Charbar and should inform him that it cannot interfere now. At the same time the Political Agent should use his endeavours to dissuade the Sultan irom comino- to a collision with Persia.' 272. These explanations were personally and carefully communicated ' by the Political Agent to Syud Turki. (V) Question of Rendition of Gwadnr to the Khan of Khelat. 273. There has recently been some correspondence on a proposal to restore Gwadur to the Khan of Khelat, one of whose ancestors is supposed to have Political A, May 1905, Nos 153-154. given it to a Maskat refugee, who after wards became ruler of Maskat, and there have incidently risen the question of the claims of some other parties to certain rights in Gwadur. We shall recapitulate the history of Gwadur, in the light of recent correspondence. 274 Gwadur, once a small village, was, as we have seen, granted by the Khan of Khelat, NasirKhan, to Seyyid Sultan of Maskat when the latter took refuge in the former's dominions from the pursuit of his brother Seyyid Said (1785—97), the ruler of Maskat. There is no contemporary evidence to show whether the grant was a free gift in perpetuity and in sovereignty as a fief with obligation to pay tribute or only a temporary gift for maintenance. At any rate, it continued in possession of Seyyid Sultan after his 'return to Maskat and subsequently after his succession to Seyyid Said in 1797. It would, however, appear that the tribute in the shape of presents of slaves and money was continued till 1847. In 18 we find the Khan of Khelat exacting the tribute by force (See ). The payment was then regularly made every year by the Maskat Sultans, until the death * of Nasir Khan II, which took place in 1857 or 1858 (memorandum by Mr. Hughes Buller in Secret E., July 1904, Nos. 147-152). It is said also that Nasir Khan sent an expedition for the capture of Gwadur, and that it was during this time that the Sultan of Maskat sent Nasir Khan 15 Negro slaves, 5 female slaves and a sword. Nasir Khan's son Khudadad Khan sent also an expedition, the object of which was to regain Gwadur. But apparently this object was not attained. 275. From that time there has been admittedly no payment of tribute by Maskat to Khelat, and Gwadur has been held by Maskat in sovereign right. Thus from a Khelat point of view the Sultans of Maskat have been in possession of Maskat for over 50 years as vasfals and then nearly 50 years as absolute owners and sovereigns. 276. Besides the Khans of Khelat there are two other claimants to certain interests in Gwadur. The Buledais (supposed to have descended from the same family from which the Sultans of Maskat descend) held the reins of power in Makran in the 17th century. They were supplanted, as we have seen above by the G-itchkhis, a family of Rajput origin. Both the Buledais and Gitchkhis patronised a religious sect called Zikris, who had their principal seat in Kech. It happened, however, it is said, that one of the Gitchkhis, Shah Omar, turned a Mussulman, and wishing to suppress the Zikris, called in the assist ance of Nasir Khan I, Khan of Khelat, who practically destroyed the sect. As a reward for his services, Nasir Khan was given half the revenues of Kej (which included Gwadur). 277. Now when Gwadur passed to the Sultan of Maskat, it is maintained, by the Gitchkhis, half its revenues estimated at 7,000 dollars, after deducting the expenses of collection (1,000 dollars), or 3,000 dollars were paid to the Gitchkhis up to the time of Bibi Mariam, a Buledai lady, who was married to the Gitchkhis Chief. This lady received a certain amount annually from the Sultan of Maskat, supposed by Uoss in 1868 in charity, but it is believed it was merely a reduced portion of the revenue. Even to this day R37 are paid per annum to Sardar Shah Omar Gitchkhi.z 101 Goldsmith's considftration by definite instructions on the express ground tliat Maskat was net; represented on the commission. The proceedings of the Ommission in no way affeot fc u any matter in dispute between Persia and JVlasket. The Political Agent should remind His Highness that on a former occasion the British G( vernment declined to interfere in respect to Charbar and should inform him that it cannot interfere now. At the same time the Political Agent should use his endeavours to dissuade the Sultan irom coming to a collision with Persia. ' 272. These explanations were ' personally and carefully communicated ' by the Political Agent to Syud Turki. (V) Question of Rendition of Gwadur to the Rhan of Khelat. 273. There has recently been some correspondence on a proposal to restore Gwadur to the Khan of Khelat, one of whose ancestors is supposed to have _ .... , . ,, lftA . 1 cq ic/i given it to a Maskat refugee, who after- Political A, May 1905, Nos 153-154. 0 , , . j.® Tir i x wards became ruler cf Maskat, and there have incidently risen the question of the claims of some other parties to certain rights in Gwadur. We shall recapitulate the history of Gwadur, in the light of recent correspondence. 274. Gwadur, once a small village, was, as we have seen, granted by the Khan of Khelat, NasirKhan, to Seyvid Sultan of Maskat when the latter took refuge in the former's dominions from the pursuit of his brother Seyyid Said (1785—97), the ruler of Maskat. There is no contemporary evidence to show whether the grant was a free gift in perpetuity and in sovereignty as a fief with obligation to pay tribute or only a temporary gift for maintenance. At any rate, it continued in possession of Seyyid Sultan after his 'return to Maskat and subsequently after his succession to Seyyid Said in 1797. It would, however, appear that the tribute in the shape of presents of slaves and money was continued till 1847. In 18 we find the Khan of Khelat exacting the tribute by force (See ). The payment was then regularly made every year by the Maskat Sultans, until the death of Nasir Khan II, which took place in 1857 or 1858 (memorandum by Mr. Hughes Buller in Secret E., July 1904, Nos. 147-152). It is said also that Nasir Khan sent an expedition for the capture of Gwadur, and that it was during this time that the Sultan of Maskat sent Nasir Khan 16 Negro slaves, 5 female slaves and a sword. Nasir Khan's son Khudadad Khan sent also an expedition, the object of which was to regain Gwadur. But apparently this object was not attained. 275. Prom that time there bas been admittedly no payment of tribute by Maskat to Khelat, and Gwadur has been held by Maskat in sovereign right. Thus from a Khelat point of view the Sultans of Maskat have been in possession of Maskat for over 50 years as vasFals and then nearly 50 years as absolute owners and sovereigns. 276. Besides the Khans of Khelat there are two other claimants to certain interests in Gwadur. The Buledais (supposed to have descended from the same family from which the Sultans of Maskat descend) held the reins o power in Makran in the 17th century. They were supplanted, as we have seen above by the Gitchkhis, a family of Rajput origin. Both the^ Buledais and Gitchkhis patronised a religious sect called Zikris, who had their prmcipa^ sea in Kech. It happened, however, it is said, that one of the Gitchkhis, Shah Omar, turned a Mussulman, and wishing to suppress the Zikria, called in the assist ance of Nasir Khan I, Khan of Khelat, who practically destroyed the sect. As a reward for his services, Nasir Khan was given half the revenues o ej (which included Gwadur). ^ • • j 277. Now when Gwadur passed to the Sultan of Maskat, it is maintained by the Gitchkhis, half its revenues estimated at 7,000 dollars, after deducting the expenses of collection (1,000 dollars), or 3,000 dollars were p Gitchkhis up to the time of Bibi Mariam, a Buledai lady, who was marr the Gitchkhis Chief. This lady received a certain amount annually fro Sultan of Maskat, supposed by Boss in 1868 in was merely a reduced portion of the revenue. Even to this y » P per annum to Sardar Shah Omar Gitchkhi. \&gt; 102 278. There has recently come forward a claimant to Gwadur in the person of the Jara of Bevla. He affirms Secret E. f March 1905, Nos. 203-208. that Gwadur witll 3 „ me - 0 ther territory was given in dower to Jam Mir Khan I, when he married Bibi Sultan Khatun, daughter of Nasir Khan the Great, and widow of Jam Gulam Shah. When Jam Mir Khan heard of the grant of Gwadur made by the Khan of Khelat, he protested againt disposal of what belonged to him, and not to the Khan, that afterwards the Mir took possession of Gwadur and held it for some 12 years (probably from 1818 to 1830, if the account is true). Since then the Jams of Beyla have admittedly never been in possession of the place. 279. On this claim the Political Agent, Khelat, in his letter No. 9, dated 1904, that the point was one, which could, if thought desirable, be taken up as between Kalat and Las Beyla should Government ever press Baluchistan claims to the port and obtained its rendition, but that as the Jam and his imme diate ancestors have not raised this claim before, as Gwadur is situated in Kalati Mekran and not in Las Beyla, and as Kalat has undoubtedly had recent relations with Maskat with regard to the port, it hardly seemed that the Jam's pretensions need be seriously considered. Colonel Yate concurred in this opinion (letter No. 374, dated 7th July 1904). 280. It might be also argued that the British Government as the suzerain of Kalat, might claim also suzerainty over Gwadur, if it once belonged to Kalat and if Kalat has still a reversionary title to the place (See Sir W. Lee- Warner's demi-official dated 4th December 1900)* Against this view, it might Secret E., September 1903, Nos. iii-iis contended that Gwadur was presented' ( Note8 [' _ to Maskat when we had no political relations with Kalat, when the latter was a vassal of Kabul, and that therefore we cannot claim now a suzerainty, which did not exist at the time of the original grant. 281. The question of the rendition of Gwadur to Baluchistan was firs^ raised during Lord Curzon's Viceroyalty by Seyyid Mahomed bin Azam, Vazir of the Sultan of Maskat, in conversation with Major Cox in the months of January and Pebruary of 1901. The Vazir told Major Cox repeatedly that it was vitally important for the British Government to become possessed of Gwadur. Major Cox writing demi-officially on this matter to the Secretary, Foreign Department, did not feel sure whether the Vazir's motives were honest^r whether he did not wish to entrap him into some expressions, which Mr. Ottavi could make capital of to create misunderstanding between the British Government and the Sultan. It was possible that the Russians had designs on the place, and there was one Mons. Zarondry, who was lurking about thp Perso-Mekran frontier at the time. 282. Major Cox was told in reply under orders of Lord Curzon (demi- official, dated 2nd April 1901),— ,f So far nothing has been heard of the foreign designs on Gwadnr, but it is a point that requires careful watching. 1 am to request that should the Sultan ever allude a^ain to Gwadur, the opportunity may be taken to remark that the British Government would certainly not permit Gwadur, surrounded as it is by territory under their control, to he in any way associated with another power.' 283-284. The question was then raised whether, in order to prevent the importation of arms by way of Gwadur, it would not be feasible to detach it from the Sultan's dominions in Oman. 285. The following is the despatch that was addressed to the Secretary Secret e ., September 1902, Nos, iii-iis. State (No. 159-Secret-External, dated 4th September 1902) :— In connection with the endeavours which have recently been made to check the import ation ot arms and ammunition into Persia, our attention has been drawn to the position of of PersS aS a trough which arms can be imported into Baluch-Makran and the interior 2 - As , You , r is aware &gt; Gwadur has been in possession of the Rulers of Maskat since the elo-e otthe 18th century, when it was conferred upon Saiyid Sultan, a Maskat retugee, by the Khan of Kalat. In 1891, at the instance of our Political Agent at Maskat, the Sultan issued an order * * Copy enclosed. prohibiting the import or export of arms and ammunition to or from Gwadur territory. We103 1 have, however, reason to believe that this prohibition has not always been observed, and we have reeentlj found it necessary to call the Sultan's attention to the matter, and to advise him to direct his representative at Gwadur to confiscate all arms and ammunition which may be landed on the coast within Maskat jurisdiction. This advice the Sultan readily undertook to follow. 3. In reporting the result of his communication to the. Sultan, our Political Agent at Maskat observed that, prima facie, the prohibitory proclamation issued by the Sultan in J 891, and his present action in enforcing the prohibition, seemed to be incompatible with the terms of Article 11 of the French Treaty with Maskat of 1844—46 : but that, as no objection had been raised by the French to the former notification, it appeared unnecessary to anticipate that any would be raised in the present case. In order to obviate any difficulty which might arise in this connection, we are of opinion that the withdrawal of Grwadur from Maskat control and its inclusion within the sphere of our predominant influence is very desirable. Signs have not been wanting of a tendency on the part of other Powers to take an interest in Gwadur and its vicinity, and we have authorised Major Cox to inform the Sultan that the British Government would certainly not permit Gwadur, surrounded as it is by territory under their control, to be in any way associated with another Power. This warning may be sufficient to prevent the Sultan from entertaining any such proposal so long as our relations with him remain as friendly as they are at present. But it is conceivable that the Sultan or his successor may hereafter prove unfaithful to his obligations, and, in any case, should France demand to post a representative at Gwadur, the claim might, under present conditions, be difficult to resistj and an embarrassing situation might arise. 4. For these reasons we are disposed to make an attempt, through His Highness the Khan of Kalat, to obtain the cession of Gwadur on reasonable terms. The offer might, we think, be ostensibly made by the Khan on his own behalf; but the price, if the Sultan accepted the offer, would be paid from Indian revenues. We have ascertained from Major Cox that the annual revenue which the Sultan derives from Gwadur is about 22,200 dollars, while the cost of administration is probably little, if at all, in excess of 311,000 a ye^r. The net value of Gwadur to the Sultan, at 15 years' purchase, may therefore, be taken at about 4| lakhs of rupees.* We consider that this sum, or, if it 7 re a, ™? ed t0 , ta . k t f ^ 0£ tlle i PlaCe =4 50 000. purchasing outright, an annual payment of ' ' tt30,0l)0 to R4.0,000, would not be too high a price to pay as an insurance against any foreign attempt to obtain a footing on the Baluch- Makran Coast, and we commend the suggestion to Your Lordship^s favourable consideration. 5. We have, of course, taken no steps at present to sound the Sultan as to his willingness to part with this portion of his territory, and it is possible that the offer might meet with a refusal. It is also possible that, if the offer were accepted, exception might be taken to the transaction by the French Government on the ground that, although the rendition would be made nominally to the Khan of Kalat, it would practically result in the extension of British influence over territory which has been in the possession of Maskat, the independence of the ruler of which was guaranteed by the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. But we can see nothing derogatory to the Sultanas independence in his selling back to the Khan a piece of land, the transfer of which from Kalat to Maskat was a mere accident, and which consists only of a few miles of coast-line, entirely surrounded, on the land side, by Kalat territory. Indeed, the independence of the Sultan would appear to be vindicated, rather than impaired, by his ability to part with such an outlying possession, forming no part of Maskat proper, and not even belonging to the Arabian peninsula. We apprehend therefore that an objection based on the Declaration of 186S could scarcely be sustained. 286. With reference to this despatch, Lord Lansdowne agreed in the Secretary of Stote's despatch No. 47 (Secret), conclusioa arrived at by the Government dated 21st November 1902, with enclosures.— Ol India tliat the Sale 01' lease Ol G-wadur Secret E., April 1903, Nos. 128-129. would not, strictly speaking, be in contra vention of the Anglo-Erench declaration of 1862, but anticipated that the transaction would be strongly oppcsed by the Erench Government who would have at least colourable grounds for their opposition. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government were of opinion ''that it would not be judicious to raise the question at the present time.' 287. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, however, made an alter native suggestion, whether it might not be possible that the proposal should be of a more limited character, as, for instance, that the Customs Administration of Gwadur should be leased to the Khan of Kalat for a term of years in consi deration of a fixed annual stipend. 288. As to this suggestion. Sir George Hamilton feared that there might be inconvenience in making an arrangement that might furnish a precedent that couid afterwards be used by other Powers for endeavouring to negotiate the lease of the customs at some port in the Persian Gulf or in the Persian littoral; moreover the situation of Gwadur bnngs it so indisputably within the prepondering influence of the British Government, that the warning already104 conveyed bj the Indian Government to the Sultan of Iklaskat might he expected to prevent effectually any interference of the kind apprehended by us. The Government of India, however, thought there would not be not much Secret E., April 1903, Nos. 128-129. gain by acquiring a leasp of the Customs at Gwadur at present. We might operate on these in an indirect way by trying to open a port of our own and attracting the trade to that port, which would of course reduce the income at Gwadur and make the Sultan disposed to part with ir, if we wanted it.* The Secretary of State was told that the Government of India do not at present propose to move in the matter of leasing the Gwadur Customs' (Des patch No. 26, dated 26th Pebruary i903). 289. In July 1903 Major Cox reported that there was much chaos in the SecretE. f July 1904, Nos. 147-152. Political Customs Administration of Gwadur on Resident's No. 134, dated 16th Julj 1903, and account of friction between thp rnsfnmc encio,, ibid.

Their diffi culties were then temporarily settled by a compromise effected by a Punch of two British merchants and one Arab merchant of Maskat with the representa tives of the Gwadur merchants, whom the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs deputed at the request of the Sultan. In accordance with this settlement new rules were issued for the levy of customs at Gwadur. 290. In September 1903, the Khan of Khelat came forward to claim the Secret E., July 1904, Nos. 147-152. rendition of Gwadur to himself {vide his . letter to his Political Adviser, dated 5th September 1908). It was submitted to Government by the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan with a memorandum and notes alrcadv referred to above (letter No. 31, dated 20th January 1904). No action was taken at the time on the question. Lord Curzon wished to wait and see whether anything came out of the negotiations with Prance about M askat and the French treaty. (VI) Reported intention of the Russian Government to place an Agent in Charge of the Customs at GAvadur, 1905, 8 291. In his letter No. 44, dated 30th January 1905, Major Grey reported Secret E., May 1905, Nos. 409-415. Seyyid Mahomed bin Said, son of ^ the Sultan's late Wazir, brought for his perusal a letter received from a Persian known as Sadid -us -Sultaneh the Eussian Agent at Lingah, stating that the Russian Government intended to place an agent of their own in charge of the Customs at Gwadur and asked for information regarding the following points : — {a) The name of the present farmer and the price paid by him to tho Sultan. i r j tu me (5) The total' yearly receipts. (c) Differential treatment (if any). {d) Other particulars. 292. Under instructions from Major Grey, in order to avoid raisin^ suspicion in the mind of the Russian Agent, Seyyid Mahomed replied 'mne the necessary information and further development was awaited. 0 293. In his letter No. 102, dated 21st February 1905, Major Grey reported that a reply was receired from the Eussian Agent expressing thanks for the information supplied, and stating that the representatives of the Eussian Government would move in the matter of the Gwadur Customs when thev had completed their history of Maskat, Major Grey could form no idea of what was referred to. * In May 1902, Colonel Ynte, Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, proposed that provision Secret E., March 1903, Nos. 231-260. (No. 248.) should he made for a combined post and telegraph office Gwadur orly making Maakal a fortnightly inrteadlu wk'y p^o^IT'Sr'rf thfaUeSIti^t'as External B., March 1904, Nos. 346-348. considered practicable by the Government of India. But „- m ii nju l -.ii.,, under the new Mail Contract with the B. I. S N Co Pasn? as well as Gwadar have been included with the ports of call for the subsidiary mail service.105 CHAPTER XV. * British Political Agency in Mekran and Persian Baluchistan. 293. Ibrahim Khan, the Persian Governor of Bampur, having laid claim to the Maskat dependency of Gwadur, and threatened to attack the place and put a stop to the construction of the Mekran section of the Indo-European line of telegraph, the Political Agent at Maskat, at the request of Mr. Mansfield, Commissioner in Sind, obtained t,he consent of the Sultan of Maskat to the landing of British troops at Gwadur for the protection of the telegraph working parties. 294. The Commissioner having strongly recommended that the Sultan's consent should betaken advantage of, the Government of Bombay sanctioned the proposal on the understanding that nothing in the shape of a military occupation of Gwadur, beyond what was necessary for the effective protection of the working parties within Khelat territory, and the possessions of the Sultan of Maskat, should be attempted without express orders from the Govern ment of India. At the same time the Government of Bombay observed, that if the officer whom the Commissioner had been authorized to select as the Assistant Political Agent, Khelat, were left at Gwadur with a small personal escort, in all probability nothing would be seen of any Persian force. 295. By letter No. 16, dated 14th April 1863, the Bombay Government *No. 208, dated 20tii April 1S63. (Political reported the case to the Government of A., May 1863, Nos. 52—56.) India; in reply* the Bombay Government was desired to report what action the Commissioner in Sind had taken on the discretionary power vested in him; in letter No. 39, dated 5th May 1863, the Bombay Government intimated that Mr. Mansfield had nominated Lieutenant E. C. Ross to the political duties at Gwadur, had recommended that as Gwadur belonged to Maskat, Lieutenant Eoss should be Assistant to the Agent at Maskat, as well as to the Khelat Agent; and had sent a hundred of the rural police under a Native Officer to Gwadur, as the Government of Bombay was averse from any military being stationed there. The Government of Bombay, in submitting this information to the Government of India, reported that , XT Lieutenant Eoss would be gazetted as t Political A., July 1863. No.. 44 -45. Assistant to the Political Agents at Maskat and Khelat. f 296. No reply appears to have been made to the above communication and , , f n, u the matter rested until 1869, when Captain t His letter related to the question of the sub- . &lt;« A sidies payable to the Mekran Chiefs for the EOSS Writing+ as ^ Assistant JrOlltlCal protection of the telegraph line.

The Commissioner in Sind (Sir T Villiam Merewether), in submitting the case to the Government of Bombay, remarked ' I trust tbat it may be in accordance with Your Excellency's views to entertain the request Captain Kos-s alludes to in the 13r,n paragraph of his letter, and I would beg mo«t gtron^lv to support any r commendation that may be adduced with the view of better dehnition of that officer's position, making it more satisfactory to himself, and so the time more advantageous to the publie interests.

The Government of Eombay made no remarks on the foregoing recommendation when sending* it up to th « Government of India.

But meanwhile the question had been discussed in the Telegraph Department, and certain information had been called for from the Govern* merit of Bombay. Accordingly that Government was told in reply to letter of the 2nd and 8th June 1869, that a reply to this call was awaited. 'J he call had been made under the following circumstances. 301. In October 186S, Captain R )ss on the ground of the frequency and extent of his tours, applied for a fixed travelling allowance. Sir William Mere- wether recommended the grant to him of an allowance of Rs. 200 per mensem. Colonel Goldsmid, to whom the question was rdferred, supported the proposal on political grounds, observing :— Captain Boss h^s already made several interesting journeys in Mekran since first appoint ment to Gwadur. He will now, no doubt, avail himself of the opportunity afforded by extension of the telegraph westward to prosecute and enlarge the sphere of these useful enquiries. But I am of opinion that his duties, though material to the construction and security of the telegraph, do not essentially relate to its maintenance. These are rather the work of a Telegraph Inspector and the Telegraph Executive. Th© payment of subsidies may, it is true, require occasional moving to and fro, but this disburse ment, charged as it is to the telegraph, is hardly devoid of political signification. In recording further, the opinion that Captain Ro^s, as Political Officer on the Mekran Co its o, with a range, say, from Jask to Sonmeani for the siad frontier, might be a most valuable Political Assistant to the Commissioner in Sind, 1 would simply point to the removal of an •![ He (Colonel Gold^mid) was Chief Director, anomaly which debits his appointment to the lado-Earopean Telegraph. department under my charge,^ without iu any way constituting him an officer of that department.' 302. The Bombay Government, however, without touching on the question of Captain Ross duties, decided that a claim for a permanent travelling allowance had not been made out, no matter whether chargeable to the Political or Tele- ** Eletric Telegraph Proceedings A., June 1869, Department ** Qn this Captain No. 58. Ross again* pressed+t the matter, pointing tt To Commissioner in sind. No 9 dated 1st out that the Government of India had February 1869.

' W be said, ' it is borne in mind that my duties are those of a Political Officer, a permanent travelling-allowance for chai se of 700 miles of the most inhospitable (physically) country in the world can scarcely be thought inapJ,a'oprintti, ,, 303.

The Commissioner in Sind submitted Captain Ross' representation for favourable consideration, saying— ' In addition to the care of the line of telegraph, the duties performed by that officer are numerous and very important, and I am strongly of opinion that he well deserves to be include d in the roll of Political Officers serving under (lovei nment, instead of being regarded merely as a.n officer serving in connection with the Telegraph Deprtment without any position in the Political Department. 305. As the questions of the travelling allowance and table money have only been introduced into tbis precis as being incidental to the question of the duties and position of the Assistant Political Agent, it will be unnecessary to t No. 176. dated 4ih May .869, (Eterio T.le- them further beyond remarking graph Proceedings A., June 1869, No. 56.) tnat m submitting them for orders, the Government of Bombay observed t :— 'Although, as a matter of account, the expense of Captain Ross' appointment has been debited to the Indo-European Telegraph Department, yet the Assistant Political Agent Mekian Coast, is, as his designation denotes, a Political Officer and a member of the Political Department. '* 306. In reply j; the Government of India enquired what instructions had JNo 367, dated27th May 1869. (Proceedings as been issued by the Government of Bombay above, No. 61.) f or Qaptain Koss' guidance in his relations with the Native Chiefs; and with reference to that officer's description of his duties as contained in his letter to the Commissioner in Sind of 1st Eebruary 1869, it was remarked that the Governor-General in Council was decidedly of opinion that the officers who had been sent to the coast in consequence of the establishment of the telegraph should carefully abstain from interference in the affairs of the country, unless their interposition was called for or warranted by the requirements of the Telegraph Department, or bad been directly authorized by the Government of India or Bombay. It was added that it was not intended that the officers concerned should be discouraged from forwarding to the Government of Bombay all information with regard to the state of affairs which they might be able to obtain which might be important and should be communicated with as little delay as possible. 307. With its letter No. 336, dated the 10th of August 1869, § the 5 Political A, September 1869, No. 312. Government of Bombay sent up a letter from Captain Eoss, in which he stated that the verbal instructions which he had received from Mr. Mansfield, who personally introduced him to the Chiefs in 1863, were to the effect that he should gain all possible information concerning Gwadur and the adjacent districts, cultivate friendly relations with the Chiefs and inhabitants by per sonal communication, and gradually feel his way by acquiring a knowledge of the languages and dispositions of the people towards establishing a beneficial in- n p r*- i * » vu i i. fluence. In cases of a serious disorder he % PoiiSi Agent', Muscat. wa8 report to Major M. Green|| on the one side, and Lieutenant-Colonel Disbrowe^' on the other. Captain Koss added that he had not at any time been authorized to interfere with the political affairs of the districts, and that he had, as a rule, most carefully abstained from such interference.108 308. Sir William Merewetlier explained tbat Captam Ross had been Instructed to act in a measure as Assistant to the Political Agent, Khelat, because a portion of the telegraph line ran through Khelat territory, and it was thought that references might have to be made to Khelat. ' There being 1 , however,' he said, ' no postal oommunication from ' G wadur to Khelat, this coarse has never^'been adopted, all questions that arose beingr reported by Captain Ross to the Commissioner in Sind, and referred by him, when necessary, through the Political- Superinten dent Frontier Upper Sind, at Jacobabad, to His Highness the Khan. ' I he connection, he added ' with the Muscat Political Agency, was formed because Gwadur belonged to the ruler of Oman, and it w^s consi dered advisable that the officer at Gwadur should be reckoned subordinate to the one at Muscat, but in reality this is not necessary, and all that has ever bad to be done there, or is ever likely to be done, would be executed equally well by the Political Officer at Gwadur, being counted separate from Muscat, merely communicating with that Agency whenever matters relating to the possesions of that power were involved. ; ' , 309. The Bombay Government in submitting the case reported that Captain Ross had already been instructed to use the greatest discretion and caution in assuminsr any political functions, and it added that these instruc tions would be repeated to Captain Ross with an intimation that, as a general rule, his duty as Political Officer should be confined to his giving it (Bombay Government) the earliest and most complete information on political affairs. *No. 1257, dated 6th September 1869.

(Political 20th of September 1889,1 the Government a ., August 1870, No. iu). of India reported the case to the Secretary of State, who replied^ :— 'Adverting to the great importance, present and prospective, of our political interests in Mekran, and to the expediency, in every point of view, of giving support to the officer who may be charged with their local supervision, it appears to Her Majesty's Government that it would be desirable that the Assistant Political Agent on the Mekran Coast should be a recog nized officer of the Political Department, receiving instructions with regard to our relations with the local Chiefs from the Commissioner in Sind, to whom he would be immediately subor dinate. ' I shall be glad to have the opinion of Your Excellency's Government on the suggestion I have thus thrown out of improving the political position of the officer stationed at tiwadur, without at the same time interfering with the discharge of his other duties as Inspector of the Telegraph along the Mekran Coast.'' In rejoinder to the above, the Secretary of State was informed § that the adoption of the proposed measure was A, Augu8?i87 a o' d N 2 o 9t i h i60 arCh lm ' (Pohtlcal considered not only inexpedient but likely to be productive of political difficulties; and looking to the importance of our political relations in Mekran, the Govern ment of India was of opinion that the Political Assistant should, as heretofore, confine himself to collecting information for submission to Government. It was pointed out that the complicated questions regarding the rights of Persia and Maskat on the Mekran Coast were of an imperial character, and depended for their settlement on various considerations, of which purely local officers were not competent to take a correct view. Moreover, in illustration of the inexpediency of entrusting the initiation of measures of an imperial character to local officers, the following instances were quoted :—It had recently been found necessary (1) to prohibit Captain Ross from going into the interior, (2) to remonstrate with the authorities in Sind for urging the Khan 'of Khelat to military action, and (3) to request the Government of Bombay to enjoin all its officials in Sind, in the most stringent terms, to abstain from interference in the disputes between Persia and Khelat. 312. With reference to these objections, the Secretary of State enquired || K. W. Political A., August 1870, Nos. 116-117. whether Government could not suggest r some means by which Captain Ross could be placed in a more intelligible position with reference to actual and possible political complications in Mekran. His Grace added that he had no wish to mrge the adoption of his former proposal in opposition to the views previously expressed by Government. H109 313. Thereupon the Government of India represented that the duties of the Assistant Political Agent had been so clearly defined as to prevent the likelihood of any embarrassment being felt by him in regard to his duties. It was explained that it was his business to abstain absolutely from interference in political affairs on the Mekran Coast, to report all avfdlable information to Government, and to be guided by the orders issued by the Government of India on information which he had supplied. The Secretary of State's attention was also drawn to the fact that, when the Mekran telegraph was sanctioned, it was distinctly provided that every effort should be made to prevent its being made a cause of political complication. ' Under the above circumstances, ' it was added, it does not appear to us desirable to * No. 160, dated 5tb August ISTO.-P.oeeedirgs make any change in the official position of Captain Political A., August 1870, Nos. 114 —ll7j.

In January 1873 the connection between the Government of Bombay and the Political Officer atGwadur was almost severed by the direct assumption by the Government of India of the superintendence of the political relations with Baluchistan.

In connection with a proposal made in 1872 to abandon the telegraph station at Gwadur on account of its alleged §Bo P tB%^d25r»2wJ876. unhealthiness, Lieutenant-Colonel Boss J was asked§ whether, if the station were permanently removed to any other place on the Mekran Coast, there would, in his judgment, be any objection to the transfer of the Assistant Political Agent to the same localitv. Colonel Ross replied 11 Po. 266-61, dated 18th March 1876. ^ there 00u l d ' ben0 objection to the transfer on political grounds, but that if the new locality should be fixed within the nominal territory of Persia, particularly Jask, it would be well that the Political Assistant should be ecc-officio an Assistant to the Resident, Persian Gulf, in addition to his other official designation, so as to provide against any exception being taken to his jurisdiction. Public Works Department No. 233—T., dated ^ ie matter, however, dropped, it having 7th July 1876. been decided to maintain Gwadur and improve its sanitary condition.^] 316. In his letter No. 681-143, dated 32th July 1876, Captain Prideaux, tfie „ ,, Officiating Resident, Persian Gulf, raised ** Captain Mockier. .. „ .. .... i a • t &lt;.» the question of the Political Assistant s position to the Persian Gulf Residency. He stated that he had been under the impression that Captain Mockler in matters affecting the internal adminis tration of the Maskat dependency of Gwadur was subordinate to the Persian Gulf Residency, and that he held a similar position in regard to that portion of Mekran lying on the seaboard between Gwettur and Jask, which was under the Government of Persia, Captain Pddeaux stated that his ' impression ' was con firmed on his reading the orders of the Governor-General in Council, No. tt Secret, June 1873, No. 338. 1282-P., dated 13th June 1873, tt—which it Proceedings as above, No. 336. prescribed that for the purposes of Notifi cation No. 1275 P. —of the same date, the territories to which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was accredited, were the coast line from Gwadur westward to the Persian Gulft all the shores of the Persian Gulf, and the Gulf of Oman with the islands situated in these Gulfs and the territories of the Sultan of Maskat in Arabia.

(Secret, June 1873, No. 339) • , * i • special arrangements were made m regard to Gwadur. The same notification which made the Political Resident a Justice of the Peace conferred similar powers on the Assistant Political Agent, Gwadur, but his jurisdiction was limited to the possessions of the Sultan of Maskat in Baluchistan. [J ||110 317. In support of a remark that a misapprehension existed in the matter, Captain Prideaux brought to notice an instaDce in which a question regarding the importation of arms into Gwadur was ' submitted direct to Government iastead of through the usual channel of the Political A ^ent at Muscat, or the Resident in the Persian CTulf.'■ , 'I have also/' says Captain Prideaux, ' heard from prvate sources that the Assistant Political A^ent has recently proceeded to Jask to investigate a case of p dsoning- which is said to have occurred ia the Telegraph Department at that station. Ja^k belongs to Persia, and being considerably t&lt;&gt; the westward of Gwadur, is both f )r political and other purposes within the jurisdiction of this Residency. Although the Assistant Political Agent may have been the officer who could most conveniently investi gate any criminal case occurring at Jask, I would submit that he should only do so under deputati n from Bushire, or if the matter -were urgent, after officially communicatingr his intentions to the Eesidency. It might lead to complications with the Persian authorities if two officers were to exercise jurisdiction in Persian Mekrau independently of each other, and it was for this reason that Lieutenant-Colonel Ross recommended that if the Assistant Political Aqent were transferred to any locality in Persian territory, he should be appointed an ex-officio Assistant to the Resident in the Gulf. 318. The reasons for this recommendation were obvious ; and by the orders, No. 1248-F., dated 30th May 1877, the Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur became thenceforth Assistant to the Resident, Persian Gulf, for the country between Jash and Gwndur, as well as Assistant to the Folitical Agent, Maskat, jor Gxoadur affairs, and Assis'ant to the Ayentto the Governor-General, Balu chistan, for the Mekran possessions of the Khan of Khelat. Major Mockler was about this time appointed to Gvvadur. It may be observed that, under the orders cited above, the connection between the Assistant Political Agent as Gwadur and the Commissioner in Sind ceased. The pay of the appointment was fixed at Rs. 1,000 a month exclusive of travelling allowance, and it was debited in equal proportions to the Political and Public Works (Telegraph) Departments, It was added that the position of the appointment would be reconsidered when the arrangement about the distribution of the charge above mentioned was reconsidered. In April 1879 Major Mockler took furlough, and a successor could not at once be found. Thus the necessity arose for re considering the arrangement just described. Captain E. L. Durand, Pirst Assistant to the Resident, Persian Gulf, was at this time sent to report on Rind outrages, and he laid stress on the unhealthiness of the Gwadur station, where half the military detichraent were suffering from ague. Sir Robert Sandeman, in his letter No. 396-P., dated August 4th 1879, considered that 'after the* settlement of the Rind question, and the strengthening of the position of the Khan's Naib at Kedj, Gwadur might be tr ade over to the Assistant to the Governor-General's Agent at Kelat, who should keep a Native Agent stationed there and visit Kedj and Gvvadur as often as possible. He thought that the telegraph line could be supervised from Kelat/ 1 Colonel Ross wrote on the same subject:—' If there should be a question of the entire abolition of the Mekran Political Agency, I would express an opinion adverse to that measure.' But he thought the maintenance of Gwadur as its head-quarters immaterial. 319 The Government of India, in their letter of 9th September 1879, No. 23J6-E.P., to the Governor-General's Agent, Baluchistan, supported the substitution of an efficient Native Agent at Gwadur for the European Assistant; but in further letter of October 9th, 1879, they proposed to invest the European officer in charge of the Telegraph Department there with such political author ity as might suffice for the disposal of minor political business, instead of appointing a Native Agent. Einally, however, the Government of India decided, on March 22nd, 1880, that the Deputy Director of the Mekran Coast and Persian Gulf Telegraphs, with an allowance of Rs. 150 a month, should exercise political powers along the coast ; and also as proposed hy Colonel Ross that the Native Assistant at Gwadur, on Rs. 40 a month, should bv retained, while the Munshi on Rs. 100 should be dispensed with. The Munshi was dispensed with on July 19th 1880, and other reductions of establishment amounting to Rs. 172 a month effected. Ihus matters went on until 1883, when Colonel Sandeman proposed to appoint a Political Agent at Kelat, an appointment which had remained vacant since 1879. Part of his salary he proposed to provide by the abolition of the allowance of Rs. 150 paid to the Deputy Director of Telegraphs for charge of the political duties at Gwadur. Colonel Ross, on January 2nd, 1884, considered the present arrangement both economical and convenient, and objected to any change. But his objections were received too late for considerations. Colonel Sandeman's whole scheme * As to the Eiud disturbauces see Slave Trade Precis, chapter V.Ill depended on the savin* of salary to be effected at Gwadur. Accordingly on Jannary loth, 1884, the Governor-General's Agent, Bahiehistan, was asked to submit his views as to the best arrangement for the future payment of the telegraph subsidy to the Chiefs inlSouthern Baluchistan. He was also, b y endorsement on January 30tb, 1884, asked to report whether the services of the Native Assistant and the two sowars at Gwadur should be dispensed with. He reported that he had not yet considered the whole question, but would hereafter submit his recommendations. Meanwhile from March 1st, 1884, the Deputy Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs- ceased to exercise political charge at Gwadur. 320. Under the arrangements thus sanctioned, the Government of India naturally understood that Dr. Duke, the newly appointed Khelat Agent, had assumed charge of Gwadur from Mr. Ffinch. But circumstances occurred which led the Government to doubt whether this was really the case. 321. Other difficulties also occurred. Colonel E /Oss reported trouble at Charbar, and we wanted to know what political arrangements had really been made, and whether the Native Assistant was still at Gwadur. We had never received a reply to our office endorsement of 80th January 1884. On 21st April last we wrote our No. 803, asking on what date Dr. Duke assumed charge of Mekran from tlie Deputy Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs. There was no evasion possible of this reference, and on 12th May, 188i, the Governor-General's Agent replied that Dr. Duke had never been put in charge at all, because Sir Robert wished to recommend a different arrangement. He meant 'in a few days to recommend ' that the Political Agent at Jacobabad should have the charge. 322. On 29th May we were told that Sir Robert had himself relieved Mr. Efinch ; deputing Colonel Reynolds to carry on the work until he could make definite proposals to Government for placing the ' control of Mekran affairs in the hands of a Political Agent with head-quarters at Karachi, ' The Government of India called for a full report, but meantime, as the new arrangements had not been fully considered and were moreover absolutely unauthorised, directed the revival of the old arrangement by which Mr. Ffinch exercised Political Powers on the Mekran coast, until a decision on Sir Robert's scheme should be come to. This temporary revival of the previous scheme was also induced by Colonel Ross' opinion of its general suitability, and by his recommendation that if no special Political Officer was to be stationed on the Mekran Coast, Dr. Ffinch should be continued in some political capacity and should collect intelligence as ex-officio Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf and Assistant to the new Agent at Khelat. 323. Meantime Government received Sir Robert's two reports of 5th and 7th June explaining his scheme for the management of Gwadur together with his proposals, of which the scheme formed apart, for the redistribution of the duties of the Political Agents at Jacobabad and Khelat. As regards the redistri bution he wrote— ♦ 4. I have always felt it to be a weak position when I have had to propose that our relations with Southern Baluchistan should be controlled by the Polilical Agent at Khelat. It would be objectionable, I thinlc, that he should be frequently and for long together absent from the Court of His Highness the Khan of Khelat. For him to manage effectively our rela tions with Panj^ur, Kej, Maud, Gwadur and Lus-Beyla^ would be an impossibility, unless he were to spend the greater part of the year in camp. This point has been brought vividly before me during my late mission. On the other hand I have found that much of the country which I have named is comparatively accessible from Karachi. ' My proposals are then as follows:— ' The Political Agent at Khelat should deal with all matters connected with Kalat Proper, including Katchi and the Khan's lands watered by the Sind Canals, and Panjgur. The Political Agent at Jacobabad should have his head-quarters at Karachi all the year round. He would manage matters connected with Lus-Beyla (inc udinfj the frontier levies), the Mekran Coast, including Urmara, Sonmiani and Gwadur, the Rinds of Mond and Tump and Keg. In the present state of feeling between Azad Khan of Kharan and His Highness the Khan of Kalat, I would^ not recommend that our relations with the Sardar should be conducted by the Political QiHcer at His Highness the Khan's Court. I should advise that they should he, for the present at all events, under immediate control of the Agent to the G overnor-&lt; i enera 1/'112 324. With regard to the proposal to place Gwadur under the Agent to be established at Karachi, Sir Eobert pointed to— U) The fact that Karachi was only days by sea from Gwadur and in direct tele graphic communication with it; (2) The fact that it was the head-quarters of the Persian Gulf Telegraph; (3) The needlessness of maintaining the connection with the Persian Gulf; (4) The inexpediency, in bis opinion, of the Director of Telegraphs paying the telegraph subsidies in Southern Baluchistan. These payments should be made by the Political Agent. At the same time the Director should communicate freely with the Ciovemor-GeneraFs Agent as to the state of the line and as to circumstances calling for a stoppage of the subsidy. He further recommended that the Native Assistant at Gwadur should be replaced by a Native Assistant to the Governor-General's Agent. He con sidered it would be a mistake to give the Director of Telegraphs any direct political work as the chiefs and tribes ought to look to the Agent above. 325. Other arguments in support of the proposal are contained in the telegram of 6th August 188which Sir .Robert despatched on learning of the temporary revival of M r. Ffinch's political duties. Proposed arrangements will give*Ffinch direct interference with Naibs of Khan and Jam and with Sardars who are really under Colonel Reynolds. The control of the subsidy is taken from me and kind of dual system of management introduced. I can under the circum stances no longer fairly be held responsible for the Political arrangement-! of that country, but 1 feel it my duty to warn Government agai^t a system which will inevitably lead in time to difficulties with the Jam and the Khan. Kindly reconsider/' 826. The Government of India however did not think that there was any- ground for apprehension as expressed in ISir Roberts' letter, dated 6th August and the reply given was— ' The re-appointment of Mr. Fiinch restores matters to the position in which they were up to March last. * * * _p or present no change appears necessary.' 327. These arrangements have remained in force up to date, the Director 's political duties are — {a) Maintenance of the rights of the Sultan of Maskat. (5) Settlement of disputes between British Indian subjects and Persian, Kalat and JVJaskat subjects. (&lt;?) The payment of telegraph subsidies, {d) The investigation of matters of interest to the British Government, such as the arms trade and the suppression of the slave traffic. 328.

Tbe Government of India declined to sanction the proposed increase (Letter to Major Cox, No 3878 E. A., dated the 18th October 1905) for the following reasons:— ' It appears from the reply of the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, to whom a reference was made on the subject that there has been no such increase in the duties of the Director in his capacity as the officer in political charge of the Baluch- Mekran Coast, as would justify the proposals, This opinion is confirmed by the figures quoted in the statement which forms an enclosure to your letter under reply. From them it seems that that there has been a falling off, rather than otherwise of iate in the volume of the Director's political duties which relate to Kalat. ' The increase has been in connection with the Persian ports and Gwadur. As regards Gwadur and the Persian ports, there appears to be no reason why at the first mentioned place the Political Agent at Maskat, and at the Persian ports His Majesty's Consul at Bandar Abbas, should not undertake the major portion of such political work as exists. Regular means of communication by steamship exists between Maskat and Gwadur, and between Bandar Abbas and Jask and neither political officer should experience difficulty in arranging for occasional visits to these or other places on the coast, in His Majesty's ships. Between Maskat and Gwadur means of telegraphic communication already exist; while Bandar Abbas is shortly to be brought into direct communication with the telegraphic system of the Persian Gulf.' 331.

Another unfailing item is supplied by the useful bush named ' Pesh ' which, I believe, is a species of aloe, and which grows in abundance throughout this part of Mekran. Prom its leaves are manufactured bags, mat ting and a variety of useful domestic articles, whilst the stones of its fruit called Koner ' are exported in quantities to Muscat, whence they are sent to Mecca and made into rozaries. The supply of the various kinds of grain and of cotton and ghee is yery variable. During plentiful seasons sufficient is grown to leave a surplus for exportation after the wants of the population are supplied. In dry years on the contrary scarcely any of these articles are produced, and the inhabitants are obliged to resort to Gwadur for their supply, when the merchants will have foreseen and provided for the demand. The following are the commodities, the produce of the interior brought to Gwadur for consumption there, and for exportation :— Wool. Goats' hair. Cotton. Ghee. Hides. Dry dates. Fresh dates. Bice Wheat Barley, Jowari. Mocng. Salt. Pesh leaves. Matting. Mat bags. Pesh stones, f Pomegranate. Bine and seeds Ispungar or') Issufgool J ' Woollen bags. Gum. Fruit.114 Of these probably about half to the following value are consumed in Gwadur:— Ghee, maunds 1,000 . Dates, bags 5,000 . Grains Salt . , Fresh dates and other fruit Woollen bags, medicine, etc. Total R 28,000 10,000 10,000 500 1,000 500 50,000 The remainder will appear in the List of Eports. The above are the commodities contributed by the interior of Mekran to the commerce of Gwadur, and are brought in by Kafilas, the goods having been previously collected at the different Depots by the agents alluded to. The fish trade of Gwadur surpasses the other branches in value. Both the quality and quantity of the fish caught on this cost are such as to render the fisheries famous. The greater part of the fish is prepared in its different forms for the Indian^market, but a large quantity is consumed on the spot and carried into the interior. Shark fins which are brought in, in abundance, are said to find their way to China, and the oil is principally kept for use on the timbers of the native craft. In the List of Imports common blue and white cotton fabrics largely pre dominate. Grain comes next, but as already stated, the quantity imported is according to the seasons. In the present estimate a dry season is supposed with respect to this item. Owing to the poverty and simple habits of the great body of the inhabitants, the quantity of other goods imported is very smalt. A wide margin should be allowed for error in the following 1 estimate of the value of the trade of Gwadur, as for some reasons the acquisition of accurate information is difficult. The only marchant who could supply such from his books is the farmer of the revenue interested in making the trade out as small as^ possible, and who would be no doubt unwilling to submit his books for minute inspection. Some other dufturs also, which might have been obtained were burnt in a recent fire.

In these the salt fish and other articles exported are conveyed to the 'West Coast of India, Muscat, and the Persian Gulf, but not further. In former times Ame rican barques occasionally called and took away cargoes of wool. ILevenue. With certain exceptions the general principle adopted for the taxation of the trade of Gwadur is the levying of an ad-valorem duty of four* per cent, on all Imports and Exports. The former not being liable to further duty on leav ing the town, nor the latter on arrival from the interior. On one occasion an attempt was made to reverse this order of things, but so much dissatisfaction was caused that it was abandoned in a few months. This rule, however, does not apply to the produce of the fisheries, the tax on which is as follows :— One-tenth of all fresh fish landed is taken by the revenue farmer. N otb —Certain privileged persons pay J per cent, less116 The salt fish is packed for exportation in what are termed 'Nungs ' which vary in size and value according to the size and quality of the fish, some 'Nungs*' contain 500 fish, some only 50, and thus value ranges from two to eight Rupees. A duty of from two annas and eight pies to three annas on each Nung is levied. Salt fish for the interior is taxed by the camelload. Each camel load four to five annas. The following is an estimate of the revenue realized by the taxation of the fish trade. RSr Tax of T V on fresh fish 1,000 Export duty on 10,000 Nungs, salt ..... 1,700 Inland duty on 3,000, o£ nearly 8 per cent. .... 1,200 Export duty on fish roe . . . , . . ,400 Ditto on Shark fins . . . , r , ,400 Ditto Fish oil . , , . , , .120 Total . . 4,820 Matting and mat bags are taxed at the rate of one anna four pies per package. Presh dates and other fruit brought from the interior are subject to a duty of about 4i per cent. The preceding are the regular Customs duties imposed by the Sultan of Muscat, and which the farmer of the revenue is authorized to exact. The present farmer or rather sub-farmer bought the lease at the rate of 5,250 Heals, or about 11,150 Rupees per annum, from Jewundass Gopaldass Mowjee of Muscat. His expenses in collecting the dues may be put at Es. 1,000. He is further charged with its payment of the Governor and his establishment amounting to 600 Eeals, or 1,400 Rupees, yearly. Jewundass Gopaldass, if I have been correctly informed, obtained the lease from His Highness Syud Thoweynee for 3,600 Eeals, or 7,650 Eupees a year, but of this I am not certain. The lease wag, for three years, and that term having lately expired it will be re-sold to the highest bidder. In addition to the regular Customs, the Sultan has, for the past three years, derived a small sum from a special duty imposed on Pesh leaves, mat ting and mat bags brought from the interior. This separate branch of the Customs is also farmed out. The farmer, a Khojah merchant, paying 250 Eeals a year, and according to his own account, collecting 400 Eeals, probably much more. The only other source of revenue is a Dye monopoly, for which the Sultan receives 100 Eeals yearly. The following table shows the probable amount of revenue actually collected, working from the preceding estimates :— Kb.
