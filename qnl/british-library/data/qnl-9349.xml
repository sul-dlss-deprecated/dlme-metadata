The pirate Chiefs, five in number, arrived here in Her Majesty Ship Daphne on the 31st ultimo, and have been forwarded to Asseerghur for deten tion there as prisoners of war. No. 207, dated 9tli December 1869. From —Lieut. Colonel L. Pf.lly, c. s. i., II. B. M.' s Political Uesident, Persian GnJj, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Dept. In continuation of my letter as per margin, and of previous correspond ence, I have now the honor to report proceedings No. 201, dated 14th November 1869. ^ in punishment of the rCCCnt piracy. And as these proceedings have been conducted by Commander G. A. Douglas, Senior Naval [Officer of Her Majesty's ships present, and myself in complete concert and harmony, I propose, in tins report, whenever I refer to matters arranged in common by us, to use the plural we, instead of rciteiating Captain Douglas' and my own names. 2. On the Idth November we had the honor of receiving at Angaum Ilis Excellency's telegram, instructing us as to the mode of procedure to be followed at Bahrein, and directing me to intimate our orders to Her Majesty s Charge de Affaires at Tehran for the information of the Persian Government. A copy of the telegram sent to Tehran is appended. 3. As regards the mode of procedure, Ilis Excellency's instructions were based on four recommendations submitted in my letter No. 184 of Hie 5th of October 1869. 4.. Of these four recommendations, one related to the blockade of the Wahabee ports; but, as the fulfilment of this recommendation was postponed by Ilis Excellencyj pending a reference to the \ ice- Viie my report sent by this op- roy, and as the question of the TV ahabec Ameer's portnnity No. 209, dated 9th De- com pii c ity in the Bahrein piracy has since formed ceiu i0r s,,, ■ the subject of a separate report, we do not propose further alluding in the present letter to this particular recommendation. 5. The three remaining recommendations which we were directed to carry into effect were as follows :— ' Firstly, to blockade and otherwise use force against Bahrein^ until the leaders of the piracy, viz., Mahomed bin Abdullah, Nauser bin Mobarek, also Mahomed bin Khalifeh himself, supposing him to be still alive, should be surrendered. Secondly, and supposing the choice to be eligible on general considerations, to recognize the son Esau, of the late Chief Alee bin Khalifeh, as Chief.00 SUPPLEMENT TO THE GAZETTE OF INDIA, JANUARY 22, 1870. ^ ' Thirdly, to come to an understanding with whatever Chief might be recognized, to the effect that the estates and other available property of the pirates and traitors, Mahomed bin Khalifeh, Mahomed bin Abdullah, and Nauser bin Mobarek, should be considered as forfeited, and that the produce or value of such property should be applied, in the first instance, towards the reimbursement of persons plundered. But I would exclude from claimants to such compensation such persons as may have implicated themselves in the purchase of plundered property at nominal rates.' C. In conformity with Ilis Excellency's instructions, we left the Angaum station with Her Majesty's Ship Daphne and Gunboat Clyde on the morning of the 15th November, leaving Her Majesty's Ship Nymphe and Gunboat Hugh Hose to await the further instructions of Government. 7. On the afternoon of the 17th we arrived at Bahrein, and on the following morning sent ashore several copies of a circular letter addressed to the Chiefs and Heads of tribes. 8. We accorded personal interviews under safe conduct to the head and some of the minor pirate Chiefs, and also to the heads of some of the peace ful Bahrein tribes. It soon appeared— Ist, that the tribes and people of Bahrein in general earnestly desired the restoration of the late Chief's family in the person of his son Esau bin Alee bin Khalifeh; and 2nd, that the pirate Chiefs in possession were disliked, but held power with a firm grasp; and that the Bahrein inhabitants were neither sufficiently organized nor warlike to expel the usurpers. 9. It appeared, indeed, at this point of the proceedings almost more than doubtful whether we ourselves should be able to seize or expel the pirate Chiefs and restore the successlorn— 10. At the same time it seemed our duty to use every effort and devote full time towards the realization of the above objects, and, failing their attain ment, to make the next best arrangement possible, in preference to injuring the islands by bombardment or other severely destructive measures. 11. Accordingly, having ascertained that Esau bin Alee was a refugee on the Guttur Coast, we invited him over with an armed escort, and cautioned the Guttur Chief to refrain from hindering him. ******* 13. As it was in the afternoon of the 10th that we commenced a series of manceuvres and operations which have resulted in the successful fulfilment of the Government instructions, we would beg at this point to solicit a glance on .Ue part ot His Excellency in Council at the annexed sketch map, which has been obligingly prepared for us by Navigating Lieutenant White, Her Majesty's Ship Daphne. li. The immediate objects in view were— \slly, to watch the Menameh Eort which was held by Nauser bin Mobarek; and Zndly, to threaten the Moharrag Eort, where we supposed it possible that Mahomed bin Khalifeh, if not already dead, was imprisoned. 15. Accordingly Daphne was left at her anchorage, while Gunboat Clyde in command of Mr. Elton was sent round to the head of the creek directly opposite the Moharrag Fort. Towards sunset we took the boats (under com mand of Lieutenant Acklom, Her Majesty's Ship Daphne) across the reefs to the spit of sand which connects the Moharrag Island with its fort. We ran% SUPPLEMENT TO THE GAZETTE OF INDIA, JANUARY 22, 1870. G1 the boats close in with intention of isolating the fort by a line of small arms- men across the spit. Some men from the fort then came down and parleyed They strenuously denied the existence of Mahomed bin Khalifeh, but after bein^ ^ suitably reminded of consequences agreed to surrender him, if only we would permit them to communicate with the garrison. A few minutes afterwards some of the garrison brought Mahomed bin Khalifeh down to the boats in irons, and thus fell into our hands by a short manoeuvre this fierce old Chief, who has for a generation past shown himself an incorrigible tyrant and pirate, and a stand ing annoyance to successive Residents. It is characteristic of the man that immediately his irons were removed, he first set to praying, then drank vi^or- o-lyof coffee, and finally requesting a private interview, explained to 'me that if I were really an able man, I should replace him in power, or, failing this, that the next best course would be to let him rouse the whole coast line against every body else. 1 • nr 0 ; 0 , n , th( 5 moraill g of tiic 20tli we learnt that the Bedouins of Nauser bin Mobarek had assembled in large numbers on the shore line below the Menameh 1 ort, and threatened a night attack on the vessels. We further learnt that the tribes and_ inhabitants in general wore in terror of violence from the pirate Chiefs and their followers. ™ • } 7 '' /. To . mee f • ihese circumstances, a letter was addressed to the head Chief informing him that if injury occurred, the ships would open fire. - eantime Clyde was brought back to the anchorage opposite Menameh. at i P 1 ™? 21st a further letter was addressed to Mahomed bin Jdullah, mlormmg him that the proceedings and movements of Nauser bin xUoharek had compelled us to resolve on dislodging him from the Menameh Fort and we simultaneously addressed a letter to the head of the tribes on the coast line, requesting that neither men nor animals might be allowed to embark. Ii 0n i3 0 2 ' n 1 rl VhflB was run in to the inner anchorage immediately opposite the Menameh lort, while the boats in charge of Lieutenant Acklom took up a Hank position commanding one of the gates. Nauser and his Bedou ins were speedily shelled out of the fort with loss, and received the fire of the small arms on emerging. 20. Nauser bin Mobarek then fled to a private house further inland. A spy indicated the building, and a sh^ll bursting in Nauser's room again com- polled him to fly with loss. 3 21 During the nights of the 22nd and 23rd information was brought to us of Nauser bin Mobarek being lodged in a musjid close to the shore line of the Bahrein Island. TV e therefore took the boats with intent to a nMit surprise, but the Pilot mistaking the channel in the dark, the boats grounded and had to return. Nauser, however, discovered our movement at davbreak and retreated inland to the hill fort Euffah. 5 22. On the 2-lth the winter set in and suspended all operations duriii' three days. 0 rr . 2 i ^ 0rl ^i 10 27 i tll . tlll, ce craft attempting to run the blockade were fired on. iwo oi them then desisted, but one ran on and was burnt. 2L At sunset of the 27th intelligence reached us that Shaik Nusser -i sort oi treasurer and general minister to the pirate Cliiefs, had sailed across to Moharrag m view to an interview with his master, and that he would probably return after dark to Menameh. lie was surprised accordingly in his boat while returning, and was brought on board Clyde, This is the man alluded to in tormer reports as having been the recipient of a large portion of the plunder and without whose aid the pirate Chiefs and Bedouins could not have subsisted! . 25 - learning on the 28th that Ahmed bin Abdullah, brother to the head pirate Chief, had been appointed to the charge of the Menameh Fort, firm- was re-opened on it; and Nymphe with Hugh Rose in tow arrivin-62 during the afternoon, their boats joined us, and at midnight we landed, entered the fort, and rendered it untenable; the boats were on this occasion in charge of Commander Meara, Her Majesty's Ship Nymphe, 26. On the 29th we landed again with the boats in view to searching the town premises of Shaik Nauser and to completing our work at ihc foit. I regret to say that during this operation, Captain Douglas received a severe shock while exploding a mine, and from which he is still suffering. 27. On the morning of the 30Lh we learnt the following important items of intelligence:— \stly, that Esau bin Alee, whom wc had invited over from Guttur, had been seen cu-vouic at Zebairah, and that 30 craft had been observed making for that point; Indhj) that Nauser bin Mobarek had left the Huffah fort and taken up a position at Jow, where he had seized some craft, in view to intercepting Esau at sea, or to making good his own retreat in case of need; Srdly, that the head Chief Mahomed bin Abdullah was still on the island of Moharrag prepared to be joined by Nauser bin Mobarek, or to escape himself by sea if necessary. 28. It now became advisable forthwith to make a move which should be calculated to meet all the above contingencies. Accordingly we took both the gunboats with all the ship's boats in tow and marines and small aims-men on board, and steamed round from the inner anchorage of Menameh to a point to the southward of Moharrag Island. 29. We thus placed ourselves in a position— Is/, to threaten Nauser bin Mobarek at Jow ; 2^f/, io aid—Eaftu with—his fleoi its passage from Zebairfth to Moharrag Island; and 3r(7, to cut off sea communication between Nauser bin Mobarek at Jow and Mahomed bin Abdullah at Moharrag. 30. The demonstration proved successful, and Nauser bin Mobarek, after committing some further cruelties, embarked with his l^edouins and fled to the Wahabec Coast. 31. On the following morning, 1st December, we again weighed anchor, and still accompanied by all the boats pushed up the Moharrag creek to a point a little way above the Moharrag Port, which we thus commanded at a distance of 700 yards, while we commanded Mahomed bin Abdullah's fortified house and the town of Moharrag generally within a distance of 1,000 yards. We were further in a position for laying out the boats and so preventing Mahomed bin Abdullah escaping by sea. 32. Wc then prepared to land on the spit already described, and isolate the Moharrag Port, which wc proposed to occupy and afterwards to make over to Esau bin Alee as a point of appui. 33. While preparing this operation, the pirate Chief Mahomed bin Abdullah came on board in hope of arranging matters, and almost simultaneously Esau's fleet hove in sight. 34. We then informed the pirate Chief of the general situation, and called on him to elect between surrendering at discretion or proceeding at once on shore to take his own course. lie surrendered, and his nephew Alee bin Nauser and his secretary named Jassim declared to surrender also, since they were committed to their Chief's cause. They sent on shore for their swords and made them over to me. 35. Meantime the landing took place (the marines and small arms-men under Commander Meara), and the garrison of the fort of Moharrag surrendered.^ SUPPLEMENT TO THE GAZETTE OF IKDIA, JANUARY 22, 18^0. 63 We occupied the fort, hoisted the British fla^ for an hour or so, and then made over the fort to a detachment of Esau's friends that had been previously prepared to garrison it. 36. On the following morning, 2nd December, Esau bin Alee with his fleet sailed up the creek, but before landing he visited us on board, when we received him publicly, recapitulated to him the circumstances of the past year, and then informing him that the rulership of these islands was vacant, and added that he could assume the government of them if it suited his convenience ; but that in so doing he must clearly understand that he acted on his own account and not as our protege ; that he should organize his tribes and means of defence for himself, and that although in the case of his late father Her Majesty's Indian Government had deemed avcII to punish those who had slain him and seized his possessions to the injury of British subjects, yet that it must not be expected that Her Majesty's Indian Government would incur similar outlay and trouble for the future. 37. Esau bin Alee accepted the government with this knowledge, and further signed and sealed a document binding him to fulfil the conditions specified in the 3rd recommendation of my letter No. 181 of 5th of October. A copy of this document is appended. 38. We then gave the new Chief some good advice, permitted him to use every precaution against aggression from the Wahabee coast line, and swore the surrounding Chiefs upon the only oath which they consider really binding {viz., ' Telauk') to be faithful to Esau bin Alee as their ruler. 39. The new Chief then went ashore, and nearly the whole of the Moharrag population turned out to welcome him, while the native craft and houses hoisted flags. 40. Esau bin Alee visited us on two subsequent occasions, and on each occasion we marked our recognition by the salute usually accorded to the Chieis of Bahrein. 41. Thus concluded our proceedings, and I trust that His Excellency in Council may consider that we have completely fulfilled his instructions. 42. As for myself I would add my deep satisfaction that no loss of life has occurred on our side. The result might very readily have been otherwise had our information been less accurate, or our own manoeuvres less successful. 43. At the same time success has not been attained without considerable hardship and exposure to all hands. Both men and officers were detached from their ships for some 17 days, during which period they were nearly constantly in the boats, and called on for severe work both by night and day. 44. To Commander G. A. Douglas, Senior Naval Officer, I cannot too earnestly express my thanks for his most cordial and efficient support during the period he has co-operated with me in this delicate naval affair. Had our unity in action been less complete, or had he been impatient of detaining his squadron until proceedings were brought to a conclusion, it would have been impossible for me now to report full success. 45. Commander Meara, Her Majesty's Ship Nymphe, who command ed the boats on several occasions, and who has more recently been of much service in visiting the Pirate Coast, has my sincere acknowledgment ol his courteous and valuable aid. 46. I would beg permission also to mention the name of Lieutenant Acklom, of Her Majesty's Ship Daphne. This old and experienced officer has performed unceasing and responsible duty during the whole period of the ex pedition, and had charge of the boats on the night of the capture of Mahomed bin Khalifeh. 47. Navigating Lieutenant White, Her Majesty's Shi]) Daphne, has placed me under obligation by his care and trouble in sounding, and by favoring me D64 SUPPLEMENT TO THE GAZETTE OF INDIA, JANUARY 22, 1870. with sketches of intricate navigation; and I may add that all the naval officers with whom I have had the honor of co-operating during the past seven years have been unanimous in opinion that they had never seen more trea cherous and pirate-like ground than that which envelopes the reef-hound coasts of Bahrein and the AVahahee ports. 48. I have already brought the claim of Captain Elton, commanding Gunboat Clyde, under the notice of Uis Excellency, and it is unnecessary therefore for me now to do more than renew an expression of my satisfaction with him during the three and half years he has served in these waters. 49. Finally, I would desire, in concluding this inadequate despatch, to record my grateful thanks to all the otfieers and men of Her Majesty's Ships Daphne and Nymphe and of the marine Gunboats Clyde and IlyrjU Hose. It would be impossible for any men to behave with better order and discipline than did the men of Her ^Majesty's ships present during this expedition. Their self-restraint when lauded in the town of Menameh after it had been aban doned by nearly all its male inhabitants, was remarkable, and defenceless women approached the column without fear of molestation. 50. It is necessary to bear in mind that while I may not venture to do more than mention the names of the officers who have been prominently associated with me, yet the heat and burthen of the day have been equally borne by all hands. 51. In the Political Department my Assistants, Majors Cotton, Way, and Sidney Smith, have been with me on every occasion , and I beg to strongly recommend these meritorious officers to the favorable consideration of II is Excellencv in Council. * 52. It would be unjust if I did not add that my Interpreter, late Acting TJncovenanted Assistant, Mr. George Lucas, has been of essential service to me. During the past seven years he has accompanied me on numerous arduous and delicate duties. 53. The utility of the Angaum Telegraph Station, as shown on the present and previous occasions, will not escape the notice of His Excellency in Council. It is situate on a most convenient point for ordinary work, and during a crisis becomes the centre of communication. 54. Captain Douglas, like other Commanders, has brought to my notice the advisability of causing an accurate survey of the Kateef and Bahrein reef channels to be made. 55. I have remarked in a preceding paragraph Hhat the officers of Her Majesty's ships were detached for some 17 days in boats and on board the gunboats, when these went into shallow waters. During this period it became necessary to mess these officers at the tables of the Commanders or gun-room messes of the two gunboats. I would respectfully suggest that no claim be made on Her Majesty's officers on this account, and that an allowance at the rate of Rs. 5 per officer per diem be sanctioned to the Commanders and Messes at which the officers referred to were accommodated.

I am to beg you to inform the Persian Government accordingly. 12th Shaban 1286. 17th November 1869. From —Lieut. Colonei L. Pelly, JL B. M.'s Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Chief or Chiefs in possession of the Island of Bahrein. I am instructed by Her Majesty's Indian Government to call on you to account for the signal breach of the maritime truce recently perpetrated on the Island of Bahrein, and in which act of piracy the Chief, Shaik Alee bin Khalifeh, was killed, the town of Menameh plundered, and numerous British subjects, together with those of Shaik Alee bin Khalifeh, grievously injured or ruined. If any, or all, of you be desirous of coming on board, safe conduct will be afforded you to and from the ship to the shore. As a precautionary measure I warn you to clear out all women, children, and other non-combatants from any and all of your forts, whether in Menameh or Mohavrag, and also from the neighbourhood of those forts, whether that neighbourhood be in the form of town or suburb ; and it is necessary you should do all this within 2 i hours from the time of ray messenger delivering this letter at the gate of your fort in Menameh. I trust that your own good sense and knowledge of the British Govern ment may forthwith lead you so to act that it may not be necessary to resort to force. But should this unhappily not prove the case, the senior officer of Her Majesty's vessels now present, and of those now on the way to Bahrein, will take such measures as to him may seem proper to carry into effect the instruc tions of the British Government. Pending further communications, I would beg you to notify publicly in the town that no boat or other craft is to move from its present position; should it do so, it will be at its own risk. In like manner, pending further communications, no vessel of whatever description should attempt to enter the harbour of Bahrein unless at its own risk. . 13th Shaban 1286. ate 18th November 1869.

After Compliments, —Five days ago I addressed, in obedience to the orders of Her Majesty's Indian Government, a circular letter to the Chiefs in possession of Bahrein, informing them of the duty on which I came here with Her Majesty s ships, and inviting them to conform with the Government wishes, lailing which it would become my painful duty to use force. I invited all the Chiefs off to visit me within 24 hours. I repeated my invitation on the following day, and refrained from using force on my own responsibility. Nauser bin Mobarek, the Chief who is now occupying the fort of the late Chief Alee bin Khalifeh, whom Her Majesty's Indian Government recognized as Chief of Bahrein, has neither acknowledged my letter, nor has lie visited me under the safe conduct offered him. On the contrary, he has allowed his piratical Bedouins to assemble in large numbers on the shore line, and utter the insulting threat of attacking Her Majesty's ships. Further, he is every night clandestinely embarking his goods and animals in boats, and sending them close in shore towards the Wahabee coast in defiance of the blockade. It is time for the Senior Naval Officer of Her Majesty's ships present and mvself to convince this pirate and his Bedouins that they cannot with im punity reiteratedly insult Her Majesty's Indian Government and injure or ruin that Government's subjects. We are compelled to act according!}. But it will be our chief care to avoid injuring the town or towns-people. 16th Shaban 1286. a ^ 0( 21st November 1869. Lieut. Colonel L. Pelly, IL B.
