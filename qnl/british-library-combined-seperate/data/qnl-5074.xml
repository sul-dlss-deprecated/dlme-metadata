Each case has a cover sheet, but there is no index of cases at the front or back of the file. The fourteen cases in the file have been arranged chronologically, with the earliest occuring case at the front of the file, and the latest at the rear. Within each case, correspondence and other papers have been arranged in a rough chronological order, which is likely based on when they were received or sent by staff at the Bahrain Agency.Each case is accompanied by its own set of internal office notes. In the first eleven cases, these notes are positioned at the end of the case papers. In the last three cases, the office notes appear at the beginning of the case papers.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence begins on the front cover and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. Foliation errors: 11A, 11B and 11C; 132A and 132B; 359A and 359B; 383A and 383B; 405A and 405B; 406A, 406B and 406C; 407A and 407B.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence and papers relating to fourteen separate slave trading incidents reported on the Trucial Coast by the Residency Agent at Sharjah ('Abd al-Razzaq Razuqi). The incidents include an owner's attempt to sell his servant's daughter into slavery, and the trafficking of persons from Persia to the Trucial Coast, and the sale of slaves by their owners.The Residency Agent sent reports of the incidents to the Bahrain Political Agency, accompanied by statements from those involved (witnesses, victims, the accused traders) and correspondence exchanged between the Agent and the ruler in whose dominion the incident took place. These papers were sent to the Bahrain Agency as a bundle of papers, and included copies of the original Arabic correspondence, with accompanying English translations. An original copy of a travel permit (issued by the Political Agency in Bahrain, and confiscated by the Sharjah Agent from a suspected slave trader) is included in the file (folio 11C).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000247#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000247#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000247#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
