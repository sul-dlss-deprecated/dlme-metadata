The discussion in the correspondence is in response to a letter from an official of the Government of Persia over a matter concerning water rights in which it was stated that 'the frontier delimitation made in 1914 is not regarded as official'.The discussion in the file relates to the British drafting of a response from the Government of Iraq to the Persian delegation in Baghdad in view of the British perception that this was the first challenge of the Imperial Persian Government to the validity of the frontier settlement of 1914.The principal correspondents are: the Counsellor to the High Commissioner for Iraq (R S M Sturges); the High Commissioner for Iraq (Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Francis Henry Humphreys); Minister of Foreign Affairs, Government of Iraq (Abdullah Al Damluji); the Secretary of State for the Colonies (James Henry Thomas).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00013d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00013d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
