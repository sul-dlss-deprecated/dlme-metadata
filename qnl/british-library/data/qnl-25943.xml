Bullard to Mr. Bevin.—(Received 28^ November.) (No. 387. Secret.) Sir, Tehran, 1th November, 1945. WITH reference to my despatch No. 263_ of the 26th July, I have the honour to transmit herewith a report on Persian affairs during July, August and September 1945. Copies of this despatch are going to His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia, His Majesty's Representative in Moscow, the Gover n ment of India, the Persia and Iraq Command, the Middle East Command, the British Middle East Office and the Political Intelligence Centre, Middle East. Internal Politics, Majlis. 1. The political deadlock which began in June owing to the refusal of the minority group in the Majlis to accept Sadr as Prime Minister continued over nearly the whole of the period under review. The minority persistently main tained their tactics of obstruction. Simply by absenting themselves from the Chamber whenever it appeared likely that a vote of confidence might be taken, they reduced the number of Deputies present below the quorum, whi(3i is absurdly high. The majority for their part refused to accept the dictation of the minority and to withdraw their support from Sadr, and eventually, on the 17th July, Sadr was able to present his Cabinet to the Majlis when 104 members were present. The Tudeh Deputies did not attend. 2. An inconclusive discussion of the Government’s programme continued for some time. The minority eventually issued a manifesto against Sadr, and sent a deputation to the Shah to say that they would not accept any responsibility for the government of the country. Although the Shah was reported to have been entirely non-committal in his reply, it was generally believed that His Majesty was not in favour of Sadr, but would have preferred his own previous choice of Hakimi as Prime Minister. In the meantime Government business was at a standstill, the only Bill passed being one to authorise the Government to incur expenditure up to one-twelfth of the annual budget to cover current needs, particularly the cost of Government salaries. 3. A special session of the Majlis to mark the end of the war with Japan was held on the 16th August, but the minority did not attend. The minority, consisting of some thirty-two Deputies who, for various reasons, opposed the Government, appeared to have formed, together with the eight Tudeh members, a solid anti-Government bloc, determined to oppose Sadr at any price. Some of these Deputies were undoubtedly influenced by their desire to see Sadr replaced by a Prime Minister more likely to favour their re-election in the approaching elections, though a growing number of Deputies, including even some of the minority, were coming round to the opinion that no elections should be held until all foreign troops had left Persia. 4. On the 18th August the Majlis, at the Prime Minister's request, held a special session to discuss a mutiny of army officers, which had occurred in Meshed a day or two earlier, and also the disturbances which had recently broken out in Azerbaijan. Sadr let it be known that he considered 4he discussion on these events a test to determine the fate of his Government. In the ensuing debate the majority reaffirmed their confidence in Sadr, declared that the minority by holding up the work of Parliament were responsible for the disorders in the country, and proposed to hold daily sessions and to invite the minority to attend. The result was an improvement in the position of the Government, and although the two groups in the Majlis failed to compose their differences, the minority group did, early in September, consent to attend sessions and thus to provide the necessary quorum. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. [72—139] B2 5. At the session of the 4th September, after Dr. Abduh, a member of the Persian Delegation to the San Francisco Conference, had made a long and care fully prepared speech on the activities of the Conference, on the drafting of the United ^Nations Charter, and its application to the Persia of to-day, the Majlis approved the Charter unanimously. 6. On the 9th September a proposal by Deputy Ardelan that in future no foreign national should be engaged without the previous sanction by the Majlis was approved by a large majority. On the 27th September a Bill was passed by 85 votes out of 105 authorising the Government to incur expenditure up to two- twelfths of the annual budget to cover expenses for the period the 20th July to the 20th September. Little further business was done by the Majlis up to the end of September. Although the minority maintained their opposition to Sadr, and although even the majority began to show signs that they did not intend to keep Sadr in office indefinitely, there was a large measure of agreement among all but the Tudeh and a few extremists, that it would be unwise to remove Sadr and precipitate a crisis at a moment when the fate of Persia was perhaps being dis cussed at the Conference of Foreign Ministers in London. 7. On the 28th September the Sadr Government at last obtained its vote of confidence from the Majlis by seventy votes to forty. This rather unexpected success for Sadr was obtained at a moment when much indignation was felt in I ehran at a telegram sent to the London Conference by a newly-formed Democratic party of Azerbaijan which demanded autonomy for that province, and claimed the right, while submitting to the general laws of Iran, “to be masters in their own land.” Under the influence of a debate on Azerbaijan which aroused feeling against the minority, the Majlis gave its vote of confidence to Sadr. Soviet Penetration. 8. Early in July a delegation of prominent Russian trade unionists arrived in Tehran in response to an invitation issued by the Tudeh party labour organisa tion. The visit was arranged without the permission of the Persian Government who, however, did not dare to stop it. Similar invitations issued to trades unions in Great Britain, the United States and France appear to have met with no response. The delegation made a tour of the Caspian provinces and visited Tabriz where they inspected various factories and talked with the workers but ignored the managers. The Russian-controlled Persian press devoted much space to the “ spontaneous ' welcome said to have been shown to the visitors by 250,000 trade unionists in Persia. A reasonable estimate of the total industrial popula tion of Persia is 150,000 and by no means all are members of the Tudeh unions. At Isfahan, for instance, which is the main industrial centre, the great majority of the workers belong at present to a trades union which is opposed to the Tudeh, a fact made abundantly clear by the omission of the Russian delegation to visit that town where they were uncertain of the reception they might receive. By agreement with the British military authorities, His Majesty’s Embassy informed the Soviet Embassy that for security reasons it would not be possible to allow the Soviet Trade Union Delegation to visit the southern oil area. The Soviet Ambassador replied that they had no intention of doing so, though he could not understand what objection there could be. 9. In July there were signs of a general increase in Tudeh propaganda in Meshed, Hamadan, Kermanshah and Southern Kurdistan. In reply to a speech by Seyid Zia attacking Russian and Tudeh policy in Persia the Pravda published a violent article, later broadcast from Moscow, accusing Seyid Zia, the Prime Minister, and his Government, of reactionary activities and attempts to suppress freedom, of organising terrorist groups, arming the tribes, &amp;c. The Russians broadcast the article from the Tehran Wireless^Station. The Persian Minister of Propaganda intervened just too late to stop it, but in time to cut the trans mission short. The pro-Russian section of the local press was now publishing increasingly violent anti-British articles accusing Great Britain of opposing all movements of freedom and progress in the interests of British imperialism. 10. Meanwhile, in Gilan and Mazanderan control of affairs seemed to be passing into the hands of Tudeh committees or soviets, and in Azerbaijan Russian control, exercised either directly or through the Tudeh party, appeared to be making headway. The Russians seemed to be intensifying their efforts to produce administrative chaos in the zones occupied by themselves. The Tudeh were stopping the export of rice from North to South Persia, and seemed to be trying to strangle the lorry traffic from Tabriz to Tehran. Government officials were threatened and sometimes suspended or expelled unless they w T ere completelv subservient to the Russians. The Tudeh which had hitherto chiefly voiced thei r 3 * lr. * A demands of the unemployed, now included agrarian reform in their programme and began to stir up unrest among the peasants. In August Tudeh agitators in a village near Tabriz, while trying to induce the peasants to withhold the land lord’s share of the harvest, clashed with the landlord and his supporters, and a fight ensued in which some persons, including the landlord, were killed. At Maragheh, in Azerbaijan, the Tudeh occupied the Government offices and turned the Government officials out. Although the Russian Ambassador disowned this movement on behalf of the Russians and (rather suggestively) on behalf of the Tudeh, and told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Government was free to take any action it liked to restore order in Maragheh, the Persian troops who ventured to arrest the local Tudeh leader were themselves confined to barracks by the Russians, who also released the prisoner. In Khorassan Tudeh complicity was suspected in a mutiny of the Persian army officers described below in the section entitled “ Persian Army.” Tudeh activity it is true was not allowed to go entirely unopposed. Local peasantry encouraged perhaps by emissaries of Seyid Zia’s party frequently came to blows with the Tudeh, especially in Mazanderan, but by early September the civil administration at Chalus, Sari, Shahi and Babul was virtually in Tudeh hands, and armed Turcomans with Tudeh armlets were patrolling the railway stations of Bandar i Gaz and Shahi. 11. As a result of these disturbances and of reported disaffection in the army the Government ordered, on the 23rd August, the strict application in Tehran of the Military Government law including the prohibition of all political demonstrations, the suppression of newspapers which incite to violence, and the re-imposition of a curfew. The Government also sent a commission of enquiry to Azerbaijan and their arrival early in September was the occasion for the issue of a manifesto “by the people of Tabriz” appealing for protection against Tudeh oppression. The notices were, however, at once torn down by the Tudeh, and the commission of enquiry appears to have achieved little. In fact, the activity of the Russians in the North continued to cause increasing anxiety. They were paralysing the Persian administration, encouraging a Kurdish nationalist move ment, and allowing no political party except the Tudeh to exist. Until the removal of the censorship in September they filled the world with Tass propaganda about Persia, and used the censorship to suppress news from other sources. A new development was reported at this time from Azerbaijan-—the formation of a ” Democratic party” which issued a proclamation on the 3rd September demanding autonomy for Azerbaijan “ with due respect to the independence of Iran,” and the right of the Azerbaijanis “ to manage the affairs of the province as they wish.” The close connexion between this new party and the Tudeh was obvious from the beginning. The Tudeh movement had recently incurred much odium owing to its open connexion with the Russians. Its complicity in the military mutiny in Meshed had also by now been clearly established. It was therefore doubtless thought necessary to adopt new tactics. Hence the reorganisa tion, under Soviet inspiration, of the forces of disintegration in Azerbaijan under the new title of the “ Democratic” party. This party held a meeting in Tabriz on the 25th September at which it elected sixty delegates to attend a General Conference of the party to be held early in October. 12. Of other party activity during this period there is little to report. Seyid Zia’s party, the Iradeh i Milli, had planned to hold its first open air meeting at Meshed on the 22nd July, but early in the same morning Soviet troops, accompanied by Persian police, arrested many members of the party committee, searched their houses and confiscated documents relating to the party. Subse quently, most of the arrested men were released, but seven were banished, and after the dispersal of Seyid Zia’s supporters the close co-operation of the Tudeh and the Soviet military propaganda authorities in Meshed was more in evidence than ever. 13. Tudeh attempts to hold party meetings and demonstrations in Tehran in mid-September were frustrated by prompt measures taken by the military governor who closed the party offices. A considerable number of Left-wing news papers were also suppressed during September, though some reappeared under other names. The Persian Government began also to show unusual courage in protesting to the Soviet Embassy against Russian activities in the North and in giving information on the subject to the press. They were encouraged to do so partly by the realisation that the evacuation of the whole of Persia bv Allied troops was only a matter of months and partly by the abolition of the censorship on press telegrams which allowed the Persian Government to defend itself against the scurrilous and partial reports of Tass. The Persian Government’s protests against Soviet interference in the internal affairs of the country either met [72—139] ' B 24 however, with no response or provoked a series of counter-accusations to the effect that Persian officials and police were inciting anti-Soviet activities. An article by an ex-Tudeh member in a Tehran newspaper accusing the Russians of trans forming the Azerbaijan ludeh party into the new Democratic party called forth i a violent protest from the Russian Ambassador, who demanded an explanation, to be submitted to M. Molotov, within twenty-four hours. The Soviet “war of | nerves was, in fact, in full swing at the end of the period under review. Tribal Situation. 14. The tribal situation during the past three months has given the Persian Government little or no anxiety for Kurdistan. In Southern Kurdistan operations around Merivan and in the Avroman area have been undertaken to punish Mahmud Khan Kanisenani for his attack on Merivan, to show the flag and to collect arms. Little has been achieved though the equivalent strength of two Persian divisions has been engaged. The Kinds have taken refuge 1 2 3 in difficult terrain on the Iraqi frontier and the approach of winter will bring the operations to a close without an\ result having been achieved. The ill success of the Iraqi army in the early stages of its operations against Mulla Mustafa Barzani has certainly emboldened the Persian Kurds. There is some talk of a Persian Govern ment commission being sent to Kurdistan to effect a settlement. If military officers of the Reza Shah school can be eliminated from its ranks, and if the commission sets about its task in the belief that the ti ibes of Persia have common rights to educational, medical and economic benefits and to a reasonable share in local Government employment, something may be achieved. 15. Northern Kurdistan, though not recently the scene of any military opera tions, is potentially the more dangerous area in that the Russians have encouraged both Tudeh activities and the Komala or Kurdish Autonomy party, the full effects of which cannot yet be assessed. A party of Kurdish chieftains was recently taken to Baku by the Soviet authorities, but it is not known whether the Kurds are being asked to support a separatist movement for Azerbaijan or whether Kurdish autonomy in additions is implied. 16. From other tribal areas there is nothing of interest to report. Withdrawal of A Hied Troops. 17. On the 10th July the Foreign Office set fortfi His Majesty’s Govern ment s aims regarding the withdrawal of Allied troops. Their object was to relax Persia and, if possible, to get all Russian troops out of Persia before the date prescribed by the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty (i.e., six months after the armistice with Japan). His Majesty’s Government had already proposed to the Russians simultaneous withdrawal by stages and military dis cussions to work out details, but had had no reply. It seemed clear that the Russians did not wish to withdraw their forces in the near future. They probably hoped by remaining to get so firm a hold in North Persia that they could establish their domination over the Persian Government. If they were successful the consequences for His Majesty’s Government and their imperial interests in South Persia would be most serious. His Majesty’s Government intended to propose at the forthcoming meeting of the Big Three at Potsdam, that British and Soviet forces should withdraw simultaneously from the Tehran district on an agreed date. Our only hope of dislodging the Russians lay in cur readiness to withdraw British troops. We had no other form of pressure except to confront the Russians with the alternatives of withdrawal simultaneously with us or of beim&gt;- shown up publicly to Persia and to the outside world as the Power responsible for per petuating foreign occupation of Persia. WJ? could not be certain that the Russians would choose the alternative we desired but there was a reasonable chance that they might. 18. At Potsdam His Majesty’s Government circulated a memorandum to the other delegates of which the following is a summary :— The time had now come for the complete joint withdrawal of Allied forces from Persia. His Majesty’s Government proposed three stages :— (1) British and Soviet forces to withdraw completely from Tehran at once (2) British troops would then be withdrawn to Abadan and the southern oilfield area and Soviet troops to a zone in either north-east or north west Persia. (3) British and Soviet troops would then be withdrawn from Persia altogether.7 r 5 19. It was agreed at Potsdam (on about the 23rd July) that British and Soviet forces should withdraw from Tehran at once and that the Council of foreign Ministers at their first meeting in September 1945 should consider further stages in the withdrawal of Allied forces from Persia. 20. The Foreign Office instructed His Majesty’s Ambassador to make with his Soviet colleague a simultaneous notification to the Persian Government of the decision to withdraw from lehran. He should not at present mention the ^ proposed discussion by the Foreign Ministers of further withdrawals. The co-ordination of arrangements for withdrawal of British, Soviet and United States forces from Tehran should be arranged locally by the embassies concerned The following were the principal points for discussion :— (a) The timing of the withdrawal. Our first aim should be to agree with the Russians on as early a date as possible for the evacuation from . Tehran of all combatant troops. (b) The arrangements for the liquidation of British military assets. (c) The future of the British Airways service to Tehran. 21. As the Soviet Government obstinately refused to send instructions to their ambassador here, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires (Mr. Lascelles) informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs alone on the 2nd August that British and Soviet forces would be withdrawn from Tehran at once. Mr. Sepahbodi received the communication with gloom because he had been hoping for much more and because he had not had a similar communication from the Soviet Ambassador. He also enquired whether “Tehran” meant the town alone or surrounding district. Mr. Lascelles replied that our nearest point would be Qum, and we hoped that the - nearest Russian point to the west would be Qasvin (which was almost equi distant). The next day Mr. Lascelles informed the Soviet Ambassador of his action and the latter seemed ready to admit that the Russian troops should with draw to Qasvin. As the embassy had foreseen, however, he then fell back on the zones as defined in the exchange of letters of August 1941. (This had laid down that the British zone should be Khuzistan and the Kermanshah area, while the Russian zone would be Azerbaijan and part of Khorassan; Meshed was not to be occupied, but Russian troops were to guard the airfield.) He did not regard the withdrawal of the British troops to Qum as the equivalent of the Soviet with drawal to Qasvin, because he argued that Qasvin was in the Soviet zone and Qum was far outside the British zone. His Majesty’s Ambassador consequently pointed out to the Foreign Office that there was little hope of persuading the Russians at the Council of Foreign Ministers to withdraw from any part of their zone while we not only remained in ours but spread far beyond it. 22. With regard to point (c) above, the embassy pointed out on the 5th August that the withdrawal of troops involved a prior decision about foreign air lines using Tehran as a terminal. The position of air lines was this :— (a) British Overseas Airways Corporation was a State line for the period of the war, though if there was room it carried private passengers on payment. The authority under which it operated to Tehran would come to an end with the departure of the last of the foreign troops and the consequent cessation of the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty. (b) The Russians operated a military airline between Russia and Tehran and, in addition, used military aircraft for cabotage between Tehran, Meshed, Pahlevi and Tabriz. (c) American Army Air Force operated military aircraft to and from Tehran carrying private passengers when it suited them. (d) The French operated a military airline by agreement with us. The * agreement was constantly infringed by the acceptance of civilian non official passengers. 23. The aerodrome position was this :— (a) Mehrabad was used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation, the Royal Air Force, the French and the Persian Air Service. The ground staff was provided by the Royal Air Force. (b) QnJeh Murgeh was occupied by the Russians and the Americans, the latter being there as our tenants. If we retained British Airways with its present status, the Russians could argue that this justified the retention of their airlines as a military measure. The embassy recommended therefore that British Airways should apply to the6 Persian Government for a commercial concession. It would be difficult for the Russians not to follow suit and if they replaced their military by a commercial airline they could hardly maintain their cabotage lines in Persia. 24. On the 7th August the embassy reported that the American military authorities in Tehran had provisionally fixed the middle of September as the date by which all American troops except for the United States Army Liquidation Commission should have left Tehran. 25. On the 9th August the Soviet Ambassador told His Majesty’s Ambas sador that his embassy had at last notified the Potsdam decision to the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Soviet forces would leave with the greatest possible speed. In reporting this to the Foreign Office the embassy pointed out that the Russians had the advantage over us and the Americans in that they had no assets of any importance in Tehran. 26. On the 19th August the Foreign Office communicated to the embassy their new proposals, revised in the light of the virtual end of the Japanese war. for the withdrawal of British, American and Soviet troops, for discussion at the Foreign Secretaries’ meeting in September. Two alternative courses seemed possible :— (1) To agree on the exact date in 1946 by which the withdrawal must be completed, and to publish the date. (2) To act as in (1) above and to press in addition that there should be an intermediate time-limit by which British and Soviet troops would have to withdraw to specified zones. These withdrawals could be either on the lines of point 2 of our Potsdam proposals, or as a with drawal to the British and Russian zones defined in August 1941 27. His Majesty’s Embassy replied on the 22nd August that course (1) should be excluded as a first line of approach to the Russians, as it amounted to saying publicly that the Allies regarded themselves as free to profit to the utmost by the letter of the treaty long after any excuse remained for so doing. This would play into the hands of the Russians and Tudeh mischief-makers. As to course (2) the embassy suggested that His Majesty’s Government should propose to the Russians the total withdrawal of both troops in less than six months. Now that the war with Japan was over, the only delaying factors were physical diffi culties of transport and the disposal of assets, and it should be possible to surmount these in less than six months in view of the political issues at stake. It would be invaluable if we could inform the Russians that we were ready to withdraw completely by about the 12th December—the date on which the Persian general elections were due to be held. If they rejected the proposal merely because they saw no reason to hurry, the world would then know that the blame for the delay did not lie with us. If, on the other hand, they decided to move out with us, it would hamper their plans for interfering with the elections. 28. Meanwhile, on the 20th August, the Foreign Secretary of the new Labour Government, Mr. Bevin, had announced in Parliament that His Majesty’s Government did not desire, and did not believe that their Soviet Allies desired, to take advantage of the treaty facilities in Persia for any purpose other than for the prosecution of the war. Mr. Eden, in commenting on this speech for the Opposition, agreed entirely, and added that His Majesty’s Government had only one interest in Persia, to see her prosperous, united and strong; the last thing they wanted was a recurrence of the zones of influence of many years ago. 29. On the 23rd August the embassy returned to the charge about the position of British Airways. They pointed out that the work of the Royal Air Force at Mehrabad aerodrome was so closely bound up with the British Airways service to Tehran that the withdrawal of the Royal Air Force could not be planned until the future of that service was known. Nor could the embassy discuss details of the withdrawal with the Russians as they would raise the question of the airfields immediately. If British Airways applied forthwith to the Persian Government for a commercial concession, the embassy could negotiate with the Persians accordingly and seek to arrange for Royal Air Force personnel to provide essential services at Mehrabad (which would be handed back to Persian control) until they could be replaced by British Airways officials pending the establish ment of a suitable Persian organisation with the necessary foreign technical assistance, which, it was hoped, w T ould be British. The alternative was to with draw altogether, but this would throw the Persians into the hands of other air lines —probably American. Meanwhile, army plans for withdrawal from Tehran by the end of September were going ahead, and unless the main party of the Royal Air Force could keep pace with them they would be in a very difficult&lt;r 7 situation, as they depended on the army for administrative services. A decision about British Airways was thus an essential 'preliminary to the withdrawal of British troops. 30. r l he Foreign Office replied on the 25th August that in British post-war plans for overseas air services Persia would not be served by any British airline, though a service from Egypt to Tehran might be operated by the new Anglo- Egypti&amp;p Company if and when it was set up. Also, British Airways were in touch with local interests in Iraq and Persia and it was His Majesty’s Govern ment s intention that they should act as technical advisers to the Iraqi and Persian airlines concerned. His Majesty’s Government did not therefore wish to negotiate a long-term agreement with the Persian Government. The alterna tives were either to maintain such facilities at Mehrabad aerodrome as to keep British Airways in operation until the expiry of the treaty or to stop their service to Tehran immediately. 31. The embassy answered on the 28th August that, since no British airline would run to Persia after the expiry of the Tripartite Treaty, it would make the evacuation of British troops from Tehran a much more clear-cut affair, and would be better for a number of technical reasons, if British Airways service ceased by the 2nd October, when the withdrawal of the main body of Royal Air Force and British military forces would have been effected. In fact, the cessation of this military line would have an excellent political effect as marking the end of the British evacuation of Tehran. His Majesty’s Government agreed to this proposal on the 2nd September. 32. Meanwhile the foreign Office had been repeatedly enquiring of the embassy why Allied troops had not been withdrawn from Tehran at once as agreed at Potsdam. The embassy replied on the 30th August that, so far as the British troops were concerned the withdrawal began at once but to complete it in a few days was not possible. It was complicated by many factors. The railway was now run by the Persians and worked slowly. Signals alone must take a considerable time to move. The 1.700 odd British troops in Tehran were split up into small units each with equipment, stores, &amp;c. These were moving south all the time. Nearly all combatant troops would go on the 15th September and headquarters and everything else except rear parties would leave on the 1st October. This methodical evacuation enabled them to make arrangements for disposal of assets which otherwise would have been impossible. The whole scheme of evacuation had been delayed for lack of a decision about British Airways. Nor had it been possible to begin discussions with the Soviet authorities until that was settled. As regards Russian withdrawal from Tehran there was no sign of this yet, but they had so much less here than we had that that was not surprising. 33. Anticipating His Majesty’s Government’s decision about British Airways by a few days, the military attache to this embassy on the 28th August approached his Soviet colleague about arranging the withdrawal. Needless to say, he failed to elicit a reply. On the 11th September, therefore, the Foreign Office instructed the embassy to inform the Soviet Embassy in writing exactly what the British position in Tehran would be by the 2nd October and to request the Soviet Embassy to supply details of the evacuation of Tehran by Soviet troops. The embassy made the prescribed communication on the 19th September (adding particulars about the withdrawal of British troops by the 15th October). It stated that— (i) by the 2nd October the British army and the Royal Air Force would have withdrawn from Tehran except for rear parties; (ii) by the 15th October the only British troops in Tehran would be a liquidated party of sixty-two officers and men; (iii) a military survey party of 105 officers and men engaged by the Persian Government in connexion with the Ear irrigation project would be working south of Tehran until the 30th November. The note also asked for corresponding information about the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Copies of this note were sent to the Persian Government and to the American Embassy. The Soviet Embassy has not replied to it. 34. Meanwhile the Persian Government had sent a note on the 9th September to the British, American and Soviet Embassies offering congratulations on the end of the war with Japan and requesting that, in accordance with article 5 of the Tripartite Pact, Persian territory should be totally evacuated bv the 2nd March (i.e., six months after the‘signature of the Japanese armistice);8 6 furthermore, any action taken for evacuation before then would arouse the gratitude of the Persian nation. 35. The departure from Tehran of British combatant troops began on the 12th September. Suddenly and without warning the Russians withdrew their troops from Qaleh Murgeh airfield and barracks on the night of the 18th-19th September—leaving them in filthy condition. Intourist personnel, however, remain, and the existing Russian airlines to and within Persia continue, serviced by ground staff pretending to be civilian. The Russians continue to hold the northern railway, and at Tehran railway station they keep a considerable number of employees, some in uniform. They also retain in Tehran about forty- five houses, some of them containing uniformed personnel. 36. British Airways’ final flight from Tehran took place on the 29th September. 37. On the 30th September the Foreign Office telegraphed the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers regarding Persia, taken on the 22nd September. It was to the following effect:— The council noted that letters had been exchanged between Mr. Bevin and M. Molotov and agreed that there was now no need for the withdrawal of troops from Persia to be discussed by the present conference. 38. The following is a summary of the letters referred to :— (1) Mr. Bevin to M. Molotov, dated the 19th September.—Since it was decided at Potsdam that the further stages in the withdrawal of Allied troops from Persia should be discussed by the Council of Foreign Ministers, the situation has been changed by the end of the Japanese war. Our two Governments will now withdraw their forces from Persia by the 2nd March, 1946, six months after the Japanese armistice, and all we need do is to ask the council to note this date. I further propose to suggest that, when the question comes up, our two Governments shall agree that by the middle of December, 1945, their respective forces shall be withdrawn from the whole of Persia except that until the 2nd March, 1946, British forces may remain in the southern oil area to the south of and including Andimeshk, and Soviet forces may remain in Azerbaijan. (2) M. Molotov to Mr. Bevin, dated the 20th September.—The decision regarding the withdrawal of troops from Tehran has already been put into effect from the Soviet side. As regards the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Persia, the Soviet Government consider that this should be effected within the period laid down in Anglo-Soviet- Persian Treaty. If necessary, the final withdrawal of Soviet and British troops from Persia could be discussed between us towards the end of that period. The Soviet Government accordingly see no need for this question to be discussed in the Council of Foreign Ministers. 39. In a subsequent exchange of letters Mr Bevin reiterated his view that the final date for withdrawal was the 2nd March, 1946, and the Soviet Foreign Minister replied reiterating the importance which his Government attached to the strict fulfilment of obligations (thus evading any commitment as to the actual date of the withdrawal). 40. The Foreign Office at the same time instructed the embassy to communicate the text of the council’s decision to the Persian Government, with reference to their note of the 9th September. The embassy were not to com municate the substance of the exchange of letters for the present. A nglo-Soviet-Persian Censorship. 41. On the 2nd July, His Majesty’s Embassy suggested to the Foreign Office that the political censorship on press messages from Persia might now be abolished, and that the Russians should be asked to agree. The American Ambassador was also telegraphing to his Government in this sense. The British military authorities had no objection provided no information about numbers and movement of troops, &amp;c., was sent out. The embassy added that the censor ship was based on article 3 (ii) (d) of the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty and was intended to protect the communications mentioned in 3 (ii) (b). Article 3 (iii) required that in the working of the censorship full consideration should be given to the essential needs of Persia. The needs of Persia, in the view of the embassy, required that both sides of the internal political question should be presentedr 9 [72—139] c to the world. At present, Russia was (through the Tass Agency, which, being official, was exempt from censorship) presenting one side and at the same time using the censorship to prevent the dissemination of even the mildest reports written from another point of view. This could not be reasonably claimed as necessary for the protection of Allied communications now that aid to Russia was no longer passing across Persia. 42. After discussion between the Foreign Office, the embassy, the United States Ambassador and Persia and Iraq Command, it was agreed that the definition of condemnations in article 5 of the agreement of January 1942 under which the censorship was exercised should be replaced by the following :— “Any communication which conveys information concerning the deployment of troops or supplies in the prosecution of the war against Japan and the output in Persia, and distribution, of petroleum or other strategic products for use in the w T ar against Japan.” 43. Meanwhile, on the 31st July the Persian Government sent to the British and Soviet Embassies an official request for the abandonment of the political censorship. 44. The embassy was still pressing His Majesty’s Government to accept the redefinition of condemnations described above, as political trouble in Azerbaijan made it important that political news should get out untrammelled, when the end of the war with Japan arrived. His Majesty’s Government immediately instructed the embassy to inform the Persian Government and the Soviet Embassy that they regarded the continuance of Allied censorship as unnecessary. The embassy were to make a joint communication to the Persian Government with the Soviet Embassy, but, if the latter had no instructions within a week, His Majesty’s Embassy were to make the communication alone. The Soviet Embassy, as usual, received no instructions, so His Majesty’s Embassy, acting alone, duly informed the Persian Government on the 30th August that British censorship had ceased that day. 45. Inspired by this the Soviet section, on the 3rd September, ceased censorship of all telegraphic and postal communications between Persia and the British Empire and United States. 46. On the 18th September the Persian Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones instructed the Persian Post Office to cease sending mail to the Soviet section of the censorship and the Soviet censor protested. This courageous move on the part of the Persian Government, however, passed unnoticed as it was immediately overtaken by further developments. On the 19th September the Soviet Ambassador informed the Persian Government that all Soviet censorship was ceasing forthwith. The Persian Army. 47. — A . Morale .—Certain factors militating against good discipline have been noticed in previous reviews of the Persian army. They still persist. Recently discontent at their financial position among the officers has increased. The Russians were not slow to notice this and, through their agents, the Tudeh party, fanned the flames of this discontent. In mid-August eighteen officers of the Meshed garrison, headed by a lieutenant-colonel in the Supply Department, obtained possession of a jeep, two lorries, a wireless-telegraphy set and arms and ammunition. To prevent pursuit they immobilised the remaining army vehicles by removing their switch keys and by putting salt in their petrol tanks (sugar, though more effective, is too expensive in Persia). With the connivance of 'the Russian control post (gome say avoiding the control post by a detour) they made their way to Bujnurd, having taken the precaution of cutting the telegraph lines between Meshed and Kuchan. On arrival there they gave out that they were come on an inspection of the cavalry squadron stationed there. They disarmed the squadron and made for the Turcoman Steppe. It was thought in Meshed, and the General Staff was so informed by the Russians, that these mutineers would join forces with a band of armed Turcomans said to number between 1,000 and 2,000 and subsequently attack Meshed. The Chief of the General Staff, having much experience of Russians, did not think that they would go out of their wav to give him accurate information about a gang of mutineers with whom they were probably in sympathy, nor did he think it likely that the Russians would tamelv allow them to attack one of their garrison towns. He acted, therefore, on the assumption that their information was wilfully misleading and reckoned on the mutineers heading in the opposite direction. Having no troops in Gunhad-i- Qabus, through which place they must pass, he asked for the assistance of the10 gendarmerie, who acted with the greatest promptness and energy. The local commandant, a lieutenant, hurriedly collected the men from their scattered posts and was able to assemble a force of about one and a half companies before the mutineers put in an appearance. They demanded right of way but were refused. A battle then ensued in which the gendarmerie, first putting the vehicles out of action, then fired upon their occupants. Seven of the mutineer officers were killed and two were wounded and taken prisoner. The vehicles, arms and ammunition were recovered. The next day three officers and four men were picked up in an exhausted condition nearby on the road between Gunbad-i-Qabus and Shahrud. ^ Later, six officers from the Tehran garrison, headed by a lieutenant-colonel on the General Staff, had deserted and effected a junction with the Meshed mutineers just before the skirmish at Gunbad-i-Qabus. These seven, and six of the Meshed mutineers, are still at large. Two others from Tehran and Tabriz who deserted later have also joined them. In Tehran a commission was appointed to examine the antecedents and contacts of officers of the central garrison. Thirty officers have been found to have close contacts with the Tudeh party or the Russians and are to be detained under a clause of the Military Governorship Law until military governorship comes to an end. Ten, less deeply implicated, have been sent away to divisions in the south. Further arrests are being made as further details of the mutiny come to light. The Chief of the General Staff, on the strength of the information so far extracted from the captured mutineers, is of the opinion that a plot for a general uprising existed and that the Meshed party acted precipitately, thus causing the general mutiny to go off at half-cock. Two officers sent by the General Staff to make a full report on the Gunbad-i-Qabus skirmish and to retrieve the captured vehicles and arms were sent away by the Russians without being able to complete their task. A party of 200 gendarmes proceeding by lorry as reinforce ments for the gendarmerie at Gunbad-i-Qabus were turned back by the Russians at Firuzkuh. A lorry conveying bombs for the Persian air force detachment at Meshed was turned back by the Russians at Semnan. Reinforcements for the Meshed garrison coming from Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam were stopped at the Russian control post south of Meshed. The fact that the original party of mutineers was able to leave Meshed at all and pass through the Russian control post en route, the attitude of the Russian-controlled Tudeh party in Meshed and elsewhere towards the mutiny and the presence in Bujnurd of the Russian Vice- Consul at Meshed a few hours prior to the arrival of the mutineers add to the growing weight of testimony to the effect that the whole affair from beginning to end—and the end is not yet in sight—had the knowledge and approval of the Russians. A Bill has been introduced in the Majlis asking for a credit of 35 million rials (about £300,000) to provide certain financial benefits to officers, such as free quarters, free issue of uniform, yearly increments of pay, children’s allowance and the formation of a co-operative society. Unless the Bill is passed and the promises are implemented it would be unsafe to say that the mutiny has been entirely stamped out. 48. — B. Administration .—No changes in administration have been made and the work of General Ridley’s American Military Mission is less and less in evidence. A Bill has been presented to the Majlis for a credit of 165 million rials for the formation of two additional divisions numbering about 12,000 men in all. A Bill has also been presented to Parliament for a credit of 3 million dollars for purchases of military equipment from the United States. 49. — C. Command .—Ibrahim Zand and General Arfa continued to fill the posts of Minister for War and Chief of the General Staff respectively. Changes in the commands of the 2nd Tehran Division, 5th Senneh Division and 7th Kerman Division were made. 50. — D. Operations .—The only operations in progress during the past three months have been those in Kurdistan in the Dizli and Avroman areas. Some 1,500 arms from the settled districts—mostly arms previously issued to friendly chiefs for road protection duties—have been collected, but as an operation to disarm the main Kurdish tribes the operations have been unsuccessful as the Kurds have retreated to inaccessible country on and even across the Perso-Iraqi border. The approach of winter will compel the Persian forces to withdraw to their permanent garrisons. Persian Gendarmerie. 51. Colonel Schwarzkopf continues to work with energy for the improve ment of the force and seems at last to have realised that the efficient administration of what Persia has and can afford will bring in better returns than grandiose schemes for what he thinks Persia should have but which Persia cannot afford.&lt;r 11 [72—139] c 2 His mission has been reinforced by two more American officers, hurther progress would appear to be limited by Colonel Schwarzkopf s failure to realise that, however efficient his direction at the centre may be, constant inspection of his provincial posts is equally necessary. Most striking is the contrast between the improvements effected in Tehran and the constant reports from consular posts as to the sloth and corruption of the provincial detachments. Nevertheless the success of the gendarmerie at Gunbad-i-Kabus (paragraph 47 above) in stopping the deserters 'from the Meshed garrison might well be claimed by Colonel Schwarzkopf as a sign of improvement in the force. Persian Police. 52. There is nothing to add to previous reviews save that, if possible, efficiency has declined still further. The force is useless and nothing but a complete overhaul by a foreign police mission can alter it. Colonel Schwarzkopf states that he has been approached unofficially to ascertain his readiness to accept the direction of the police in addition to the gendarmerie. He replied that he did not think the United States Government would consent to supplying the number of military officers required or that the Persian Government could afford to pay them. Persian Air Force. 53. During the quarter there has been much discussion of proposals to expand and modernise the Persian air force by substantial purchases of British equipment, mainly Hurricane aircraft, and by reviving in some form the connexion between the force and Hawker—Siddeley aircraft which existed up to 1942. With the help of the R.A.F. and of a representative sent out by Hawkers for the purpose, a fairly comprehensive plan was worked out which is believed to have been approved by all concerned up to the point of facing the appropriate committee of the Majlis, wffiere the inability of the Minister of War to answer elementary questions on it has caused a postponement which may well be fatal. 54. 'With these developments in the offing, morale in the air force has improved, though it will hardly be able to stand the shock of a collapse of these hopes. Some keenness has been aroused during September by the return of airfields and the attempt, albeit a rather poor attempt, to maintain the signals and meteorological services on which the R.A.F. have taught them to lean. Meanwhile, almost entirely as the result of the efforts of the officers recently returned from the United Kingdom, there has been by Persian standards a notable improvement in flying training. Other training remains hardly perceptible. Finance. 55. The Persian Government have formally submitted a request that the gold payment due to them under the Financial Agreement shall be placed at their disposal in Ottawa. The Government’s sterling holdings fell from £18,600.000 to £14,900,000 during the quarter. The stock of gold held in Tehran by His Majesty’s Government was transferred to Cairo at the end of September. 56. The free market price of sovereigns rose during the quarter from 683 rials on the 1st July to 716 rials on the 30th September. The sale of gold by the National Bank was resumed on the 23rd July. The market was fairly easy during the period, the chief demand being for export to Iraq. 57. The free market rate for the dollar rose to 68 rials as compared with the official rate of 32 rials. Sterling commanded a small premium varying from 146 to 142 rials as against the official rate of 130-75 rials. Exchange Control. 58. It was announced in August that the Minister of Finance had appointed an Exchange Control Commission to consider a reimposition of exchange control regulations and to draw up revised regulations. As a temporary measure, the Exchange Control Commission has authorised banks to grant sterling exchange freely against imports on production of the necessary documents and to open documentary credits. Facilities have also been given in regard to limited personal remittances to the sterling area. Owing to their shortage of dollars the Persian authorities are imposing severe restrictions on the opening of dollar credits, and most of the private trade with the United States is at present conducted on the basis of black market dollars which command a premium of over 100 per cent. It is possible that the Exchange Control Commission may recommend a reversionto the system previously in force by which foreign exchange could only be obtained by the purchase of export certificates giving the importer who bought them the right to a specified percentage of the value in foreign exchange. Imperial Bank of Iran's Concession. 59. The Bank Melli has given the Imperial Bank of Iran six months' notice to terminate its present agreement; the effect of this denunciation would be to deprive the Imperial Bank of Iran of its right to deal in foreign exchange and would leave the bank without any provision in regard to the transfer of profits. Concurrently with this action on the part of the Bank Melli, however, the Imperial Bank of Iran were negotiating direct with the Minister of Finance for a new concession which has now been ratified by the Council of Ministers and now awaits signature by the Minister of Finance. Economic Situation. 60. The end of the war brought in its train the liquidation of Allied supply organisations in Persia. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation no longer carries out any supply or transport functions and its remaining staff is concerned solely with the work of liquidation. Middle East Supply Centre was also, by the end of September, making arrangements for its withdrawal at the end of October. 61. The United States advisers continued to serve the various departments to which they are appointed, but they are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the indeterminate nature of their functions and many of them wish to resign. 62. There has been no improvement in the machinery of economic control exercised by the Persians themselves and, in particular, the import licensing department continues to be ineffective and corrupt. The business community has tended to take more and more advantage of the increased confusion in Govern ment Departments and is now openly flaunting its contempt of controls despite the fact that the law still requires importers to obtain import licences for all commodities. The largest part of the goods which has come in during the last few months has been dumped in customs and then cleared by persuasion. To make this situation even more absurd, officials in the licensing departments are informing applicants orally that they need no longer bother to lodge applications. 63. In July the Cabinet sanctioned the abolition of the cotton monopoly, only retaining control over the import of raw cotton. 64. Markets were dull throughout the quarter despite the end of the war. This was mainly due to the reimposition of exchange control and a realisation that goods could still not be obtained freely from abroad. Despite the premium on dollars, exports to the l nited States were confined to small quantities of caseins and lambskins. Cereals Situation. 65. Although there is a huge surplus of food-grains the Government still dare not offer it for export for fear of exposing themselves to the allegation from Russian-inspired quarters that they wish to starve the Persian population for some nefarious end. For the same reason, useful as the surplus would be in such countries as Greece, the British Embassy has refused to make proposals for its purchase and have said that any proposal for export of grain must come officially from the Persian Government. 66. At the end of September the total collection of bread-grains in Persia amounted to 170,000 tons, of which 108,000 tons was wheat. The stocks at Tehran equalled 211 days’ supply. 67. It remains to be seen how the Cereals and Bread Section will succeed in the collection and distribution of wheat and flour now that the Middle East Supply Centre with its team of British officers employed in grain collection is |dosing down and that Colonel Ataullah, I.M.S., who has been the mainstav of the central cereals organisation nearly three years is leaving. T ransport. ^ 68. Railways. W ith the return of the southern section of the railway to 1 ersian operation the usual statistics covering traffic movements have ceased to be available. Stocks of oil and cereals have both been adequately maintained in spite of the slower turn-round which Persian operation has brought about. The full effect of the reduced efficiency of the system will not be felt until the coming winter.13 69. Road. —The Persian Government is proposing to sell by public auction about 3,600 used lorries, the property of the now defunct Road Transport Administration. 70. The importation of passenger cars has been decontrolled, but the actual number likely to be available for some time will be below importers’ expectations. 71. Tyre prices have'fallen heavily as the result of the sale of numbers of second-hand tyres by the military authorities. Civil Air Lines in Persia. 72. As recorded above, British Overseas Airways Corporation stopped at the end of September. The Russian services, which seem to be civil or military at will, were not brought to an end when the Russian troops left Qaleh Morgheh. The French are apparently trying to keep their military service in being pending the grant of commercial rights, and have said that the Persian Government asked them to carry on since the British had let the Persians down by stopping. The Americans have not yet replaced their military services by civil lines, though they are evidently anxious to do so. Meanwhile they propose to run occasional military aircraft as long as they have any troops left in Tehran. 73. The Iranian State Airline has run witn commendable regularity between Tehran and Bagdad and Tehran and Bushire, though its operations are very inefficient and it is far from making full use of its few aircraft. It would be easy to expand frequencies, if not routes, had it only some managerial skill at its disposal, and it is not to be wondered at that tlie Ministry of Posts who control it should be lending an ear to proposals from private interests to take it over. 74. The private interests are, however, squabbling among themselves. They are in two groups which centre round the Mayor of Tehran, G. H. Ebtehaj, who runs (among other things) Irantour, and General Ahmad Nakhchevan. who seems to be relying on his past glories to put himself into a position where he can get a substantial rake-off from somebody. Efforts to bring the two groups together have so far failed. Iranian Airways, the company with which Ebtehaj is associated, have made a provisional agreement with the American Trans continental Western Air for a joint subsidiary to run DC3s on terms very favourable to Transcontinental Western Air, but nobody really expects the deal to be completed. Iranian Airways have also applied for four Dominie aircraft on hire from His Majesty’s Government. Disposal of British and American Military Assets. 75. Telecommunication System. —An agreement was concluded (it was signed after the end of the quarter) providing for the sale to the Persian Ministries of Communications and of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones, of the entire poled wire routes in Persia, together with the entire carrier and associated equipment. The American carrier equipment was not available for sale and was withdrawn. The purchase price was £300,000, payable as follows :— (i) 25 per cent, of the purchase price against signature of the present agreement. (ii) 25 per cent, within three months of signature. (iii) 50 per cent, within two months after the beginning of the next Persian financial year, i.e., as from the 22nd March, 1946. 76. Fixed Assets (General). —Fixed military installations in the North Persia area were offered to the Persian Government but they declined to buy on the ground that from their interpretation of article 4 of the Tripartite Treaty, buildings should revert to them free. As a further approach merely produced a reiteration of this claim, tenders were invited in the public press for the purchase of these installations. In general they have been sold at satisfactory prices, but the Convalescent Camp at Vanak did not produce any satisfactory offer owing to the fact that it was built principally upon Crown land. The camp has accord ingly been dismantled and the buildings are in the process of being demolished. Difficulty is also being experienced as regards the saw-mill which is on land belonging to the Persian State Railways. Negotiations are still continuing with the Railway Administration for the purchase of this saw-mill by them, but if these fall through, the installation will be dismantled and the machinery will be sold to private buyers. Schedules are being prepared of installations south of Hama- dan and the Persian Government will, in due course, be asked to state whether14 they are interested in their purchase. We shall probably receive the same reply as that given in the case of the Northern installations, and in this event sale will be carried out by public tender. 77. Railway Assets .—This question is likely to be a very thorny one because, apart from the fact that we shall have to overcome the Persian claim that all buildings should revert to them free, we are also handicapped by the absence of any agreement regarding freight rates. 78. The railway administration entertain large hopes that a substantial amount, in the neighbourhood of £7,700,000 will be paid to them in addition to the sums we have spent to maintain the railways since 1942, but this hope is likelv to be disappointed. At the end of the quarter, His Majesty’s Embassy were on the point of addressing a note to the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs setting out the lines on which it is suggested negotiations, both for the settlement of freight rates and of payment for assets, shall be conducted. 79. American Assets .—The Americans offered for sale to the Persian Government their fixed installations in the Northern Area but no reply had been received by the end of the quarter. An agreement was reached between the l nited States Embassy and the Persian Government by which the latter purchased f&gt;8 American locomotives, 1,350 wagons (including 277 oil tank cars) and surplus' Vmerican railway stores to the value of $500,000. The purchase price was $10 million. The 277 oil tank cars in question are considered by the British and American railway experts to be the minimum number, in addition to the 303 tank cars already owned by the Persian State Railways, to ensure an adequate distri bution of oil in Persia. This view is not shared by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com pany which estimates that a further 146 tank cars should be purchased. These are available in Persia but they will be shipped elsewhere by the United States authorities unless the Persian Government come to a very early decision to pav dollars for them. r J Press and Public Opinion. 80. Comment in the Persian press during the period was on well-established lines—wdd or mischievous misinterpretations of foreign affairs and the actions of the gieat powers; violent criticism of internal policy and of those who apply it, without the offer of anything constructive. 81. Foreign interference in Persian affairs was a constant theme. The toming elections aroused particular anxiety in this connexion : the Soviet strangle hold on the northern provinces caused deep and articulate apprehension to the Right-wing press, while its few remaining opponents countered with allusions o the alleged interference of British officials (sometimes designated by name) in the 1943 elections m Ears and Kermanshah. * 82. The military government of Tehran was abused as a recrudescence of dictatorship— es pe ci ally by the Left-wing “ freedom front,” most of whose papers it had suppressed. This muzzling of the pro-Russian press left the way almost entirely clear for its opponents to attack the Russian policy in northerii Persia and those elements (sc. the Tudeh party and its offshoots: the “Democrat” party of Azerbaijan and the Kurdish-nationalist “ Kumala ” group) which sup ported it. At the beginning of the period the Left-wing papers were opposing the evacuation of foreign troops; but this opposition was damped down by the publication m late July of an article in the Times in which evacuation was taken tor granted, and extinguished by the appearance of the Bevin-Molotov corres- Pi? oT™ 11 Molotov, though he appeared to be evading mention of the 2nd March, agreed to evacuation within six months of the end of the war with Japan. It may be said that Persians in general are waiting with hope rather ^March 06 t0 ^ whether the Rllssian withdrawal will be completed by the . The Prartfo attack on Persia, the Khorassan mutiny, the more recent visit of Kurdish nationalists to Baku and divers high-handed actions of the Red army against the freedom of the individual (whether true or fabricated) have xUrthei exasperated Persian opinion against Russian interference in the northern provinces. Right-wing papers have, on the whole, been bold and outspoken against Russia. F 84. America has come in for criticism for the first time since the' days when the newly-arrived American troops laid themselves open to attack by their rather tree and easy behaviour in Tehran. The storm aroused by the discovery that the United btates Orovernment was not giving something for nothing is' described below m the section headed “American Interests.”' The appearance of the American Embassy s communique and the after-thought that American support&lt;r 15 might some day be useful brought about a change in the attitude of the press which from hostile became conciliatory—in some cases almost sycophantic. 85. The Foreign Ministers' conference in September had aroused high hopes in Persia, and its failure caused profound disappointment. The Persians expected their problems to be given high priority in the agenda, forgetting that they were already provided for by Treaty. The not unnatural reaction has been to inter pret the conference as a sign of dissension among the great Allies—a dissension which the less scrupulous papers are not reluctant to foment. Disagreement between Britain and the United States over oil and the situation in Palestine has been hailed with satisfaction in some papers. 86. The end of the Japanese war made small impression, and the atomic bomb also has aroused remarkably little comment; though one .paper announced the discovery of uranium on the Caspian coast and hoped that this discovery would not be as troublesome to Persia as that of petroleum. 87. Mr. Bevin’s statement of the 20th August on evacuation and Mr. Eden’s reply mentioning Britain's opposition to the principle of spheres of influence both had a particularly good effect. The advent of the Labour Government was at first regarded with suspicion, some circles supposing that it would try to conciliate Russia at Persia’s expense, others declaring that since British foreign policy did not change it was a cunning ramp. General opinion has now settled down and accepts it for what it is. 88. Alexander Clifford’s articles on Persia in the Daily Mail achieved wide publicity, and though they received abuse from the “ Freedom Front ” it was impossible to disprove the revelations they contained. Hitherto only Tass had been allowed to export news from Persia, and the appearance of information from another source, with the revelation of the working of the Soviet censorship, had a soothing effect on public anxiety. The Times article on Persia aroused less anger than sorrow that it should be left to the foreign press to point out the defects of the Persian administration. 89. Near Eastern politics have received little mention. The wild Persian claim to Bahrain crops up periodically. The Arab Federation is opposed by the Left wing as a plan imposed by foreign imperialists in order to keep the Arabs in a backward and primitive condition. British, and other, Propaganda Activities. 90. Following Ministry of Information instructions, drastic steps have been taken to reduce expenditure in the Public Relations Bureau of this embassy. The budget estimates for the year beginning the 1st December, 1945. amount to £49,315, compared with the sum of £122,764 for the year ending the 30th November, 1945. Furthermore, various economies already effected will probably result in a saying of approximately £34,000 on the latter figure. The budget may be divided into three headings, namely : — o . . ' . £ (a) Staff salaries and allowances ... ... ... ... 41.400 (h) Operational expenditure ... ... ... ... ... 23,765 Total ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 65,165 {c) Receipts 15 850 Net proposed expenditure for 1945-46... ... ... 49,315 91. From a total of some 186 persons at the beginning of the current year, of whom 26 were British, the staff has now been reduced to about 80 persons, of whom only 7 are British. (Although the budget figures quoted include expenditure by consulates in the provinces, the figures of staff employed do not include those engaged wholly or partly for publicity purposes by consulates in the provinces.) 92. By far the largest economy is the closing down of the Tehran Daily News, the last number of which was due to be published on the 12th October. It was to be replaced by a daily roneoed bulletin issued privately to subscribers' Other economies have been effected by ceasing publication of the women’s magazine (Alam-i-Ziana'/i, a monthly illustrated periodical); by drastically curtailing the visual publicity section’s activities in the production of material; i)\ gi\ing up two of the bureau s se\en touring cinema vans; by handing over the bureau s newsreel cinema back to its Persian proprietor, who will continue showing our films (but at his own expense and not ours); by the closing down of tliG Allied liaison section, by reducing 1 the number of reading rooms in the16 provinces and otherwise curtailing consular publicity activities; by closing the British Information Centre in Tehran; by stopping the Public Relations Bureau courier service, and by other general reduction in expenditure. 93. No evidence has been seen of any parallel reduction in propaganda ! activities by the Russians. On the contrary, there are many signs that they I are still engaged in stretching out their tentacles into the provinces. In addition, j ^e press section of the French Embassy has grown considerably and is becoming : much more active than before. In spite of the abolition of the Office of War Information, the American Press Attache’s staff has grown recently, though so l far his activities have appeared to be confined to Tehran. 94. Certain of the activities of the Public Relations Bureau may have to be reconsidered after the 2nd March next year when the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty expires. Indian Affairs. 95. During the hot summer months the Indo-Iranian Cultural Society was dormant, with most of its members out of Tehran, but the autumn has brought signs of its revival. 96. The “ Iran League ” of Bombay have presented to Persia a bronze statue of the Persian epic poet, Firdausi. It has been erected in a prominent position in the City of Tehran and was to be unveiled with pomp and ceremonv on the 2nd October. 97. The Director-General of Archaeology in India (Dr. Mortimer Wheeler) is expected here by the end of October to start a thirty-days’ tour of the archaeological treasures of Persia before going on to Iraq. „ 98- The Indian teachers of English at Ahwaz, Kerman and Yezd took retresher courses under the British Council at Tehran and it is felt that they will now be able to arouse more interest among the Persian pupils. 99. In December 1944 the Persian Government promised to allow the removal to India, for urgent use in connexion with the war with Japan of some two miles of rails from an unwanted railway siding at Mirjawa, the frontier town on the railway from India to Zahidan. However, by expert procrastination they succeeded in omitting to implement their promise until the arrival of VJ-dav made it difficult to continue to press for the rails. Indian Trade. 100. The Indian Government Trade Commissioner is now installed in hk office. Many trade enquiries have been received from Indian merchants and Persian importers. Although trade is still controlled from both ends, the parties concerned are showing a keen interest and eagerly awaiting the relaxation and u timate removal of the various restrictions. The importance of India as a source ot supply is being realised. India has a good chance of taking a considerable sunnher ofTpa 8 ^jP 011 market. During the war also, it has been the principal supplier of tea, cotton piece goods, spices and jute manufactures. It is hoped ® ! nte n na s upply situation in India will improve quickly and so permit a g eater flow of the^ commodities in demand in Persia at the moment Trade te^^iSs^jut^manuIactures^lMther good^a^dhectHca^equipment’^I’er^an (a) Cotton Piece-goods .—Government of India have been pressing f 0 r some time, through the Middle East Supply Centre, that the Persian Government should agree to the importation of cotton piece-goods first 1 half’of *r &gt; Q 4 ' f£ ected throu f h normal trade channels.

The Persian Government are showing an interest in developing trade with India, and have deputed Dr. Ali Amini, a senior officer of the Ministry of Finance, to visit India and explore the possibility of strengthening the com mercial links between the two countries. A merican Interests. 102. The visit of Senator Pepper in September on his way home from Moscow, served as an occasion for the exchange of American-Persian compli ments. In a press account of a party given to Mr. Pepper by the Speaker of the Majlis, the Senator was reported as expressing the affection of Americans for Persians and declaring that the American Government supported the indepen dence of small countries, and neither interfered themselves nor allowed others to interfere in the affairs of weak nations. According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Senator Pepper expressed the same thoughts, but even more strongly, at a dinner given to him at the Ministry. The fact that in the speech at the Majlis he declared that it was attachmeni to Persia that had prompted his visit to Tehran did not prevent Senator Pepper from pressing the request of an American airline for facilities in Persia. With disarming simplicity he explained to the Minister of Foreign Affairs that while the average American is full of idealism, a little concrete interest always helps. 103. For some time the T.W.A. (Transcontinental Western Air) had been negotiating with a Persian company, offering terms which left the management % to the Americans and the risk to the Persians, hut the negotiations fell through. The American Embassy then applied for facilities for this company and at the same time urged the Minister for Foreign Affairs to sign the Chicago Agree ments, including the Air Transport Agreement. Knowing nothing about the Chicago Agreements, and being in general against the signature of anything in the nature of a concession until the last of the foreign troops should have left, the Minister for Foreign Affairs pleaded for time to consider the matter, in spite of the argument advanced by the American Ambassador that to give the Americans this material stake in Persia would engage the interest of the United States against possible aggression by Russia—aggression which he suggested Great Britain would hardly be able to meet alone. 104. Having learned (thanks to the British air attache) what the Chicago Agreements with their Five Freedoms involved, the Minister for Foreign Affairs decided (1) to tell the American Ambassador that the Persian Government must postpone consideration of so complicated a matter but (2) to offer to the Americans permission for their civil aircraft to fly to and from Tehran without prejudice to any future arrangement, and (3) to promise that after the withdrawal of the foreign troops the Persian Government would be prepared to conclude with the United States a civil aviation agreement, provided that it took account of the aviation rights and needs of Persia in this region. 105. The hesitation shown by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the American demand for air rights intensified the annoyance which the American Ambassador was already feeling at the criticisms published in some of the Tehran newspapers at the news that the United States Government intended to remove from Persia not only certain assets it needed but the remainder too, unless the Persian Government or Persian individuals were prepared to pay for them. The attacks were usually based on the fact that the presence of American troops in Persia had never been sanctioned by the conclusion of an agreement, and some times they proliferated into abuse of the United States or into criti cisms of the behaviour of the American troops in Persia. On the 27th September the American Embassy published a communique explaining the attitude of the American Government in regard to the assets, and asserting that if the presence of American troops was not governed by an agreement that was because the Persian Government delayed discussion of a draft put forward in 1943 by the American Ambassador, not only on behalf of his Government, but personally. He considered an agreement to be necessary. These attacks were resented by the American Ambassador not only on behalf of his Government but personally. He had long regarded himself as the champion of Persian independence, and as proof he claimed to have been the author of the Declaration about Persia, which was issued after the Tehran Conference in 1943; and in his violent reaction against what he considered ingratitude to him in person he presented a sad spectacle of the disillusioned sentimentalist. 106. Although we did not hear of it officially until October, Mr. Murray was worrying about the failure of the Persian Government to make use of the18 a ? ■ ; * } r American advisers, and was in correspondence with the State Department on the subject. We did know, however, that as soon as he took office, M. Bader, Minister of Finance in the Sadr Government, began to consider a reduction in the number of the advisers. His ostensible plan was a good one—to get rid of the less efficient (there are many who would be no loss) and to keep perhaps eight or ten for tasks where disinterestedness and indifference to Persian political or personal pressure would be of most value, arbitration, partition of the crown lands among the tenants, and so on. Private information, however showed that he came to think that Persia could dispense with all the advisers, and this doubtless influenced his attitude, made him unwilling to consult the Americans (though it is true that he tended to ignore his Persian assistants too), and therefore drove the American Embassy to the conclusion that the American mission was unable to perform any useful service and was doing harm to United States prestige by remaining here. 2 /ansfev of Polish Legation to Warsaw Govemment. 107. Late in June the Warsaw Government sent a telegram to the repre sentative of I olpress ’ in Tehran, M. Lopatniuk, instructing him to take all steps to secure the property of the Polish Government in Tehran. His Majesty’s Embassy explained to the Foreign Office that he was an ex-chauffeur of the Polish legation and had been convicted for theft, and was hardly suitable to be the official representative of the new Polish Government. The embassy added that instructions issued to the Polish Charge d’Affaires by the Polish Government in London were to wait until the Persian Government withdrew their recognition trom him and recognised so-and-so as duly accredited representative of the new 1 ohsh Government. He was then to ask the Persian Government to take over the Polish Legation and property here. The embassy added that the property and funds employed by the Polish delegation in Tehran for the benefit of the Polish refugees were presumably to be treated separately and not handed over to the i epi esentative of the new Government. The Foreign Office agreed 108. On the 23rd July, the Persian Government recognised the new Polish Government and in the middle of August they accepted a M. Eugene John u aS Char ^ ^ affaires. In peace-time he had been an inspector of schools- he had been captured by the Russians in 1939 and released in 1941, and had come to Palestine, where he was court-martialled and imprisoned by the former 1 ohsh military authorities on a charge of having defamed the Polish Govern ment whilst in Russia. 109. The new charge d’affaires presented his letters to the Persian Govern- ment on the 22nd September, and took over the Polish Legation premises from them When he called on His Majesty’s charge d’affaires he asked for informa tion about the Polish refugees and this was supplied to him. Polish Refugees. , ^J le dissolution of the Polish Government in London left the Polish authorities there anxious lest the refugees in Persia should be deported to Russia ugainst their will, the Foreign Office enquired whether there was any danger of this, i he embassy thought not, particularly since the embassy had formed a polish refugee section and the refugees were thus under its auspices. On the other hund, the presence of these refugees in a country partially occupied by the Russians was a potential source of Anglo-Russian friction and it was desirable to remove them to less contentious territory. The history of the quarter is therefore largely concerned with the proposal to evacuate the refugees to the ebanon. The first set-back was early in July, when the movement to the Lebanon of the children s school at Isfahan and their attendant teachers and parents totalling 800 odd persons, was cancelled owing to the anti-French trouble !r e r e j-xi i r6St , e ( l u ? rfcer was s P en t in overcoming various difficulties. The nrst difficulty was that the Lebanon Government demanded further assurances from His Majesty s Government that the refugees would not be left indefinitely in the Lebanom his assurance His Majesty’s Government eventually granted. Jhe second difficulty was the question of accommodation in the Lebanon Bv the end of the quarter the move to the Lebanon of the Isfahan Poles had been once again approved, but not the move of the remaining 3,000 Poles, n i lu 1 Late in July U.N.R.R.A., Middle East, pointed out that, although they had theoretically taken over the obligations of M.E.R.R.A. vis-a-vis the Poles in F^ersia, they neither controlled the policy nor the camps, nor did they suonlv the finance, all this being still in the hands of His Majesty’s Government and&lt;rt 19 the Treasury Anglo-Polish Committee which was winding up the affairs of the London Polish Government. U.N.K.R A. therefore requested to be relieved of their existing obligations, though they would be ready if asked to take over the 1 oles on their own terms and, for example, run the camps themselves on their own more economical lines. 112. On the 24th August the embassy pointed out to the Foreign Office that then position of protectors of the Polish refugees was proving invidious. Un the one hand, Moscow newspapers were accusing representatives of the former Po ish Government of sending to other countries Poles who desired to return to Poland and since these representatives were controlled by His Maiesty’s Govern ment, these accusations reflected on them. On the other hand, the oblio-ation imposed on the embassy by His Majesty’s Government to reduce the expenditure Qt made the embass y unpopular. The embassy therefore recom mended that the refugees should be entirely transferred to U.N.R.R.A. as soon as possible^ On the 1st September the Foreign Office informed the embassy confi dentially that they had asked U.N.R.R.A. to assume responsibility for displaced . persons the majority of whom were Poles, in the British Empire, and, where tt xt'S S A ■ , , not ? one 80 alread y. in the Middle East, including Persia. U.JVK.K.A. had not, however, replied by the end of the quarter 113. At an interview with the Polish Refugee Section of the Embassy, the new \\ arsaw Charge d Affaires said that he was unable at present to give official assistance to any refugees wishing to return from here to Poland, though any who could travel at their own expense were welcome to go back. Nor could he maintain any refugees who adhered to him or establish camps for them He however expressed a wish to visit their camp and asked for facilities to circulate his Legation s bulletin there as the refugees knew nothing about the present Poland Ihe Embassy agreed to both these requests. Finally, the Charge d’Affaires explained that he saw no objection to the move of the refugees to the Lebanon since repatriation to Poland from there would be easier than from Persia. a ^ itud ? t be Charge d’Affaires made matters politicallv much less difficult for this Embassy, since his acquiescence in our arrangements mini mised the prospect of Soviet misrepresentation. On the other hand, his refusal to repatriate or maintain his adherents meant that none would declare themselves openly for him as otherwise they would forfeit their benefits under the existing j refugee organisation. It is thought, however, that if given a firm chance of returning to Poland, about 300^00 (i.e., some 10 per cent, of the total) would o- 0 115. By the end of the quarter the number of Poles in Persia had °- 0 ne down from 3,798 to 3,475. s ^ t Persian Internees. 116. All remaining Persian internees, including both those interned in Persia and those interned in Palestine, were released on the 15th August or a few days later. In order to anticipate any manifestation in their favour, repre senting- them as Persian patriot martyrs, a communique was published’at the same time in the press by His Majesty’s Embassy, emphasising their complicity m the German conspiracy against the Allies and reproducing 1 ; in facsimile, the letter addressed by the Sayyid Abul Qasim Kashani to the Grand Mufti and Rashid Ali in Berlin. European Internees. 117. In consultation with the Security Authorities it was decided on the 7th June that, in principle, none of the several hundreds of Europeans deported from Persia or arrested in Persia in and after the year 1941 should be allowed to return, except for compelling compassionate reasons. The grounds for this , * decision were— (1) That under present economic conditions in Persia, Europeans would rarely be able to find employment. r (2) That the return to Persia of several hundred Axis partisans having little love for the Allies would be undesirable for reasons of security. (3) That the necessary consultations with the Russians might cause difficulties. 118. Although the British Security control of entry into Persia was surren dered in August at the time of the end of hostilities against Japan, the Persian authorities appear to be unwilling to permit the entry of ex-internees without express British approval. In these circumstances the above decision was then upheld and was made known to the Persian Government and to the Australian Government and the Government of India.20 119. A considerable number of applications for permission to return to Persia have already been rejected in accordance with this policy. Ihe six Germans still remaining in internment in Persia have similarly been refused permission to remain in the country after release, and are to be repatriated m due course to Germany. 120. The problem of the disposal of the wives, children and interests in Persia of repatriated persons remains to be solved. British Council. 121. In view of the considerable cuts in the Council s allocations to Persia, the staff of the Council here have been analysing the possibilities of intensifying their efforts with a minimum of expense and have reached the conclusion that this can best be achieved in the following ways :— («) Maintenance of the present scale of English language classes with the assistance of Persian teachers, since British teachers are not available in sufficient quantities. (6) Concentration on the professional classes, appealing to them through their specialised subjects and through professional societies or groups to be formed in conjunction with the Institute activities. The pro fessional classes are able—and eager—to finance such societies them selves, requiring of the Council only accommodation for meetings and up-to-date British professional literature. {c) The appointment to the Council’s staff in Tehran of scientific and medical advisers to cultivate Persians with scientific and technical qualifica tions. 122. The high lights of the quarter were the production of Shakespeare s Tempest (in English) and Flecker's Hassan in a Persian translation, both at the Tehran Institute's summer school at Shemran. Both were fine performances, and the second was notable as the Council s first attempt to acclimatise drama in f^prsiciii 123. On the 30th September, 1,327 students were registered at the Tehran, 417 at the Isfahan, and 348 at the Shiraz Institutes. c J.'1«JP5j(k5U INDEXED THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT C? $u.

This question took on a more practical form during the quarter as a result of (1) abandonment of the Persian route for aid to Russia, (2) presentation of official notes by the Persian Government to the representatives of Great Britain, Russia and America in Tehran, asking for the removal of Allied troops forth with, and (3) the announcement that the Big Three would be meeting shortly. 2. When the quarter began, overseas cargo for Russia had almost ceased to arrive at Persian ports, but Russia was still benefiting by the Persian route to the extent that she was receiving aviation spirit from Abadan under an agree ment which was due to expire at the end of June. It was decided, however, that Russia should be supplied from some other source with the June quota of aviation spirit, so that, with effect from the end of May, aid to Russia, with the exception of a small quantity of cargo lying at the ports or on the sea, ceased entirely to be sent across Persia. 3. On the 19th May the Ministry for Foreign Affairs addressed a note to His Majesty’s Embassy asking for British forces to be withdrawn from Persia forthwith, arguing that it was essential that Persia should be able to return to normal in accordance with the wishes of her people. It maintained that Japan was so remote that the war in the Far East could not be influenced by the presence of Allied troops in Persia and added that in any case Japan on her own showing was no longer allied to Germany. The Tripartite Treaty concluded to promote the war effort against Germany had therefore lost its meaning. The note added that communications on the subject had been addressed also to the Soviet and American Embassies. Under instructions from the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s Ambassador informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in reply that although His Majesty’s Government could not accept the argument that the Allied Powers were not entitled by the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty to keep troops in Persia until six months after the end of the Japanese war, they were nevertheless pre pared to consider sympathetically the Persian Government’s request that the withdrawal of Allied troops from Persia should begin before the final date fixed by the treaty. He added that His Majesty’s Government were discussing the question with the Soviet and United States Governments. 4. His Majesty’s Ambassador in Washington was instructed to inform the State Department of the action taken in Tehran and to explain that it had been taken before consultation with the United States Government because news had just been received that the United States Government intended to withdraw American troops from Persia, and to hand over operation of the railway by the 1st July, and because the attitude of the State Department at the time of the Crimea Conference suggested that it was unlikely there would be any serious [ 68 — 110 ] RECo. P3L. C£?T. 28 SEP^M 1 ; INDIA OFFICE2 difference of opinion between the two Governments on the subject. It was suggested that it would assist Persia and, incidentally, His Majesty’s Govern ment, if the United States Government would tell the Soviet Government that they regarded it as desirable that the evacuation of Persia should start at an early date. It was left to the discretion of His Majesty’s Ambassador whether to inform the State Department that we were not prepared to withdraw any troops except pari passu with the Russians, and that the extent of our with drawal was limited by the obligation, until the end of the war with Japan, to protect the oil-fields and the refinery. A few days later the iVmerican press reported the Acting Secretary of State as saying, with regard to the Persian Government’s note, that the United States Government naturally sympathised with the Persian Government’s point of view, and that it was, he believed, well- known that the number of American troops in Persia was already being rapidly reduced. 5. The attitude of the American Embassy in Tehran was disappointing. This was seen at its worst in a harangue by the American Counsellor, who argued that whatever we did Persia would be eaten up by Russia in a few years anyhow, and whose conscience disapproved the British attempt to induce the Persians, by the placing of a time-limit on Allied offers of assets for sale, to make up their minds quickly—and thereby give no excuse to any foreign Ally to retain troops to guard its assets. The heart of the counsellor bled like anything, but as it was not quite clear whether the wound was caused by British brutality in trying to hustle the East, or by fear that haste might produce fewer dollars for American assets, it was difficult to find the right styptic. Even the new ambassador, Mr. Wallace Murray, in spite of his avowed suspicion of Russian motives, deprecated a too speedy withdrawal of British troops lest this should interfere with the sale of assets. 6. In reply to the communication from His Majesty’s Embassy m Washington the State Department said that they were drafting a reply to the Persian note agreeing to the idea of withdrawing troops from Persia before the final treaty date. The State Department agreed that it would be desirable foi British and American troops not to be withdrawn except pari passu with the Russian, but on the other hand said that the War Department would not wish to delay the withdrawal of American troops for political reasons. I he Wai Department would wish to leave, until the end of the war with Japan, 500 men to service the air transport command, besides leaving guards on military installa tions and properties until their final disposal, which might take many months. The State Department were considering what, if anything, they would say to the Russians. , , , ^ 7 The nature of His Majesty’s Government s reply to the I ersian note was communicated to the Soviet Government in Moscow on the 31st May. The communication was to add that His Majesty’s Government now wished to propose formally that Allied troops should start withdrawing from Persia pari passu and in stages before the final treaty date, and that military talks should be held to discuss the stages in which such withdrawals might take place. No reply had been received by the end of the quarter—perhaps because arrangements for a meetino- 0 f the Big Three had already been made. The Persian Ambassador m Moscow could get' no information from the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs beyond the fact that the question “ was bein^ considered carefully.” The Soviet Ambassador was in his permanent state of having received no instructions, but he assured the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the presence of the Soviet troops was only temporary and that the mere removal of material would take a long time g a possible hindrance to our good intentions came to light with the discovery that when the transfer of the railway to the Persian Government relieved the British forces of the responsibility of guarding it, the railway brigade would be moved from the railway and housed in the camp at Hamadan no longer required by the Americans. The advantage of good ready-made quarters in a good climate was fully realised by His Majesty’s Embassy, but it seemed that ft would completely wreck our attempt to secure a substantial withdrawal of Soviet troops if at this moment we placed a large body of troops much farther forward than ever before, and quite close to Qazvm the point above all whicn it is desirable to clear of Soviet forces. It was found however, that once free of its duties on the railway, the railway brigade would not be needed in Persia at all and the plan to use the Hamadan camp was abandoned. This was fortunate, for the pro-Russian newspapers in Tehran were already announcing the arrival of British troops as well as a great increase in the British forces t3 [68—110] B 2 at Kermanshah—an allegation which had a nucleus of truth in the seasonal transfer of troops to the Kermanshah area from Iraq to escape the hot weather. 9. The more the question was studied the sharper seemed the unfortunate contrast between our good intentions hampered by the exigencies of the war with Japan and the obvious intention of the Russians to keep a hold on Persia for as long as possible in spite of the fact that this was justified by no military neces- sity whatsoever. The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, and the General Officer * - Commanding-in-Chief, Paiforce, considered that so long as the war with Japan H went on, troops must be kept in the Kermanshah area—the only suitable place in the Middle East with a good climate; and this involves retention of the camp „ j at Bisitun—twenty miles nearer to Tehran than the nearest point allowed to us when the military zones were defined with the Russians in 1941. 10. A curious misunderstanding had to be cleared up, viz., that the proposal for the withdrawal of troops was a policy of appeasement—a feeble attempt to conciliate the Russians. The right policy, it was suggested by the holders of this view, was to tell the Russians that we needed to stay in Persia because we were at war with Japan : the Russians always understood a bold front and would respect us. It was explained in reply that this “ bold ” policy would delight the Russians, because the more of Persia we occupied, the easier it would be for them to justify the retention of Soviet troops; and that our aim, far from being a policy of appeasement, was to use against the Russians the only weapon in our hands—that of exposure of their “ imperialist ” tendencies, if they refused to make any substantial withdrawal by making the facts public. This we considered would explode Russia’s claim to be the protector of small nations, both in the minds of the Persian public (where it finds little credence even now) and in foreign countries, especially in the United Kingdom and the Tnited States. 11. It is realised that Tehran could not be evacuated in a few days. There are complications, such as a saw-mill run by British military labour which is essential for the erection of quarters for troops at the base, and the military party which is making a ground survey of the Ear Valley on behalf of a British firm which is seeking a contract for building a big dam. In all such cases the question is whether, if military personnel was left, either in uniform or in civilian clothes, the Soviet Government would claim it as a proof of continued retention of British troops in Tehran and as an excuse for staying there themselves. The Royal Air Force, too, have interests which could not be abandoned at a month’s 1 ' notice. They would have to shuffle off their responsibilities for the Doshan Tappeh aircraft factory and, if the British Overseas Airways Corporation were still running their service to Tehran, alternative arrangements for airfield control, meteorological service and signals would have to be made. It seems to His Majesty’s Embassy that every day the Russians strengthen their grip on the north of Persia, and that, consequently, the necessity for the evacuation of at least Tehran with the minimum of delay grows more obvious; and if His Majesty’s Government decide for the evacuation of Tehran the difficulties must be attacked from all sides with the greatest vigour, whereupon some obstacles which at present appear large may shrink in size. 12. The problem can now be summed up thus :— (1) It will presumably be proposed at Potsdam that we and the Russians should begin the pari passu evacuation of our troops forthwith, commencing with Tehran. (2) We shall not be embarrassed by the stationing of British troops at Hamadan. (3) We shall, however, be embarrassed if it is considered essential to retain troops at Kermanshah-Bisitun after the autumn, since it seems quite certain that the Russians would then wish to retain troops along the Tabriz-Qazvin-Tehran-Semnan-Meshed line, thereby prolonging the paralysis of the capital which serves their political schemes so well. An alternative suggestion made by the embassy was to keep the mobile reserve in a tented camp at Karind, which is only just inside the Persian border, or better still (if there is no suitable place in Iraq) in ** Palestine. If troops could be brought by air to Abadan or the oil fields from Palestine in case of emergency, they should arrive as quickly as troops from Kermanshah could arrive by other means. The * * question whether the airfields in the oil-wells area were or could be ' made adequate to receive airborne troops remained to be examined. (4) An important factor is that dealt with in paragraph 30 of the March quarterly report, whether the security of the oil area could be assured4 without British troops by some sort of police force. This continued to be debated. At the beginning of June the War Office asked the General Officer Commanding-in-chief, Paiforce, whether, in his opinion, the Persian oil-fields could be reasonably well protected against sabotage and disturbances, of internal security, if all British troops were withdrawn from Persia, by some such arrangement as the employment of the Persian army or ttie use of an armed and trained^' civilian police force. He was also asked whether the mobile force could be held in Iraq to re-enter the oil-fields if necessity arose. The General Officer Commanding, showed the political, strategic and climatic objections to the retention of the mobile force in Iraq, and on the other question he quoted probable American objections to our entrusting the protection of the oil to Persians and to our removing troops before they had had time to dispose of their assets advantageously, and he pointed out that hurried evacuation would probably mean great loss to His Majesty’s Government in the price to be obtained for our assets. His conclusion was : if South Persian oil was vital in the war against Japan, then although sabotage in the oil-field was easier said than done and, although security was good at the moment, it was considered essential to retain British/Indian troops in Abadan and desirable to retain our troops in the oil-fields and the reserve brigade in Persia. 13. On the question of the replacement of British/Indian troops in the oil area by a British/Indian armed police force the General Officer Commanding-in- chief calculated that 3,000 would be required, but that if as appeared preferable Abadan was guarded by soldiers, the oil-fields would require 2,000 police. It was agreed by all concerned that the more the Persian authorities could be associated with the defence of the oil area the better : they would perhaps work hard to improve their forces so as to justify us in effecting the maximum withdrawal possible, and that would make the transfer to peace-time conditions easier, and help to ensure the protection of the oil area when the British forces had left the country. This led to an examination of methods of improving the Persian police and gendarmerie, which was still going on when the quarter came to an end. British A rmy. 14. The previous report omitted to mention that on the 15th February Paiforce ceased to be an independent command and came under the Middle East Command. 15. During the quarter under review the number of British combatant troops in Persia remained at about 10,200 men. Proposed Counter-Measures against Soviet Pressure. 16. In April the Foreign Office asked whether more could be done to prepare against further Soviet pressure on Persia, since the Russians might return to the charge at short notice. The standard Soviet complaints against any Government which they wished to subvert were (1) that its failure to maintain order was a threat to Soviet security; (2) that it was “ Fascist ” and needed to be replaced by a “ democratic ” Government representing the will of the people. The Russians might well claim that their interests were threatened by disorders in Azerbaijan or Tehran. And it was difficult to maintain that present Persian Governments represented public opinion. In case the Soviet Government tried to confront them with a fait accompli, His Majesty’s Government should be ready to make firm representations at short notice and to explode any Soviet claim that their own nominees represented public opinion any better. The Foreign Office asked, first, that this embassy should supply notes on Persians whom the Russians might be nursing for this purpose, which notes could be quoted to the Russians. Secondly, they asked for a list of the more notorious cases in which the Russians had prevented the Persian Government from keeping order, by interfering with the latter’s proposed security measures. Thirdly, this embassy must maintain pressure on the Shah and Persian Government to carry out social reforms. Another very important factor was publicity (since wide advertisement of the difference between Russian professions and Russian actions was apt to put the Russians off their stroke). This point is discussed in the next section. Reluctance of Anglo-Saxon Press to Publish News of Nefarious Soviet Activities in Persia. 17. One of the troubles of this embassy is that nearly all foreign publicity about Persia is pro-Soviet. (This was particularly noticeable last autumn when5 the Soviet Government was putting unfair pressure on the Persian Government to grant them an oil concession in North Persia.) One cause is that the Soviet section of the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Censorship conducts a heavy political censorship on messages from foreign correspondents in Tehran, and the latter dare not circumvent it lest they or their colleagues elsewhere should be penalised. Another is that the news agencies disregard messages from their Tehran / correspondents and imagine that Persian news is only news if it comes from 'Moscow. This is disastrous since the Tass Agency in Tehran, as an official agency, is exempt from the Anglo-Soviet-Persian censorship and telegraphs what messages it likes, and these form the basis of foreign correspondents messages from Moscow. Conequently it is only the visiting journalist to Persia who can evade the Soviet censor and speak plainly. 18. The following are illustrations of the effect of the Soviet censorship on foreign correspondents. When Mr. Sulzberger, the New York Times special correspondent in Moscow, passed through Tehran he was scornful regarding the way correspondents allowed themselves to be used as instruments of Soviet propaganda about Persia. His words had scarcely died on his lips, when he sent from Tehran an interview with the leader of the Tudeh party, in which he publicised the lie that the Tudeh was a genuinely democratic party. After arriving in Moscow he did worse still, and telegraphed a message stating that the British facilitated the return of Seyyid Zia to Persia, thus representing us and Seyyid Zia as the joint opponents of the Soviet Union and of the Tudeh party. When taxed with this message Mr. Sulzberger alleged that he had written as near as he thought possible to the edge of the Soviet censorship’s disapproval with the aim of throwing ridicule on the recent Soviet press comment on Persian affairs; if his message had given a pro-Soviet impression then his sub-editor in New York had failed to detect his ironic intent! Shortly afterwards, the war correspondent of the Chicago Daily News also telegraphed an interview with the leader of the Tudeh party, containing the whopping assertion that the latter received no money from the Russians. His Majesty’s Embassy in Moscow commented that neither of these correspondents was in the least deceived by Soviet propaganda about Persia, but that if they wished to enter Soviet territory again they could not criticise Soviet policy openly. 19. This question was also discussed with the State Department, who under took to investigate whether an American editorial writer or commentator could produce an impartial article on Persia which might be telegraphed abroad. (So far as this embassy is aware, nothing has come of this suggestion.) This embassy then suggested that the Daily Express correspondent in the Middle East should visit Persia and send a message after having left the country. The Foreign Office replied that neither the Daily Express nor any other newspaper wanting to have a correspondent in the Soviet Union or Soviet-occupied Europe would publish any article unflattering to the Russians; the best course would be to get an article published in the Economist or Manchester Guardian, as they had no Moscow correspondent.* This embassy commented that it was disturbing when important English newspapers, including presumably The Times, dare not send truthful messages from Persia lest they should lose the privilege of sending untruthful ones from Moscow. Persian Internees: British-Soviet A menities Regarding Same. 20. Twenty-six Persian internees were released from internment at the request of the British and Soviet authorities in April and May. However, their war against Germany having ended, the Soviet authorities could not resist currying favour with the Persians at our expense. On tihe 25th May, the Soviet Ambassador proposed the immediate release of the remainder; and by the 29th May, the Soviet authorities had already informed the Persian police that they were willing to set free all internees, but that the British authorities opposed their release. On the 2nd June, therefore, His Majesty’s Ambassador informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the British security authorities desired the detention of those internees only who might be a danger to the countries at war with Japan. Thereupon thirty-one more internees were released. The Soviet Embassy then published a statement in the press that they were not opposed to the release of any of the internees. The Soviet Ambassador also informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs accordingly, and, having ascertained the names of those whom the British authorities wished to keep interned, emphasised that he considered desirable the release of the Mullah Ka^hani, and General Aghevli (whom the British authorities regarded as especially dangerous).6 « Shortly afterwards, the British authorities found five men in the internment camp, whom the Soviet authorities had interned and then forgotten about, so His Majesty’s Embassy had pleasure in informing the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that it disclaimed all interest in them. Assuming that the Soviet authorities have now been good enough to liberate them, the total number oi Persians released from internment during the quarter was sixty-two. 21. Thirteen Persians now remain interned in Persia, twelve in the Persia^ camp at Tehran and one, the Mullah Kashani, in the British camp a Kermanshah. A few more, including General Zahedi, are interned in Palestine. On the 2nd June the Persian Prime Minister enquired of His Majesty's Ambassador whether the internment of those in Persia could not be commuted to forced residence in the small town of Mahallat, fifty miles east of Sultanabad. The proposal has been approved by all concerned, except that Kashani is to remain provisionally at Kermanshah; the future of Zahedi and the others in Palestine is not yet decided. Internal Politics and Soviet Interference. 22. Bayat was still in office at the beginning of April, owing largely to the inability of the Deputies to agree on a successor. His Government was, however, slowly disintegrating. Nasrullah Intizam, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, resigned on the 1st April; Ibrahim Zand, Minister for War, had gone to Palestine for medical treatment; and the Russians were bringing increasing pressure to bear on Bayat to dismiss Sururi, Minister of the Interior, who had shown firm ness in dealing with Tudeh activities. A deadlock appeared, moreover, to have been reached in the Majlis, with Government supporters and opponents in roughly equal strength. This became evident when the Majlis, meeting again for the first time after the No Ruz recess on the 3rd April, proceeded to elect its new president. Seyyid Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai, the retiring president, who was a strong supporter of Bayat, was re-elected by a majority of one vote over his principal rival, Farrukh, the nominee of Bayat’s opponents in the Chamber. Bayat, however, appeared to enjoy the support of the Shah, who was believed to be working to expose the futility of the Majlis, and of the Russians to whom a state of continued administrative paralysis was not unwelcome. 23. On the 15th April Seyyid Zia deposited a motion of non-confidence in the Government on the bureau of the Majlis, requesting an early debate. The motion was subsequently withdrawn by the Seyyid when he learnt that Bayat intended to clarify the position of the Government, at the next meeting of the Majlis. This took place on the 17th April, when Bayat made a long speech which was frequently interrupted by cries of dissent, defending his Government's policy, and asking the Chamber to judge between his Government and their opponents. He complained that instead of taxing the Government in open debate his critics had for some time done their best to undermine the Government’s authority by spreading false rumours such as, for instance, the alleged arming of the tribes and the formation of a tribal bloc, or the stories that the Americans leaving Persia were destroying or removing all the installations they had built in this country. He claimed' special credit for the speed with which he had settled the Millspaugh problem and denied that it had any adverse effect on Persia’s relations with the United States. When, however, the vote was taken only forty-five Deputies voted for Bayat, with three against and forty-three abstentions. The Government thereupon resigned. 24. Although the Shah sent messages urging the Deputies to find a successor to Bayat without delay and to put an end to the crisis, no Government had been formed by the end of April. After endless argument the Deputies decided to nominate representatives from each parliamentary fraction to meet together and try to find a solution. At a secret meeting of these representatives on the 24th April Mahmud Bader received most votes, with Qawam es Sultaneh a close second, and Mansur, Pakravan and Sadiq Sadiqi far behind. Bader was, nevertheless, not chosen because the Russians were against him. The inability of the Majlis to come to a decision was indeed due largely to the fact that some thirty or forty Deputies wished to elect a candidate pleasing to the Russians; and although they were unable to impose a man of their choice on the Majlis, they were able to block anyone of character and ability proposed by their opponents.' The Tudeh meanwhile were demanding a coalition Government in which they would be represented, although they have only eight members in Parliament. The result was a compromise, with the selection of a candidate who was considered a harmless nonentity. On the 2nd May Ibrahim Hakimi (Hakim ul Mulk), who is old and deaf and has played no important part in7 Persian politics for many years, was chosen Prime Minister with sixty-four votes, against twenty-four cast for Sadiq Sadiqi (Mustashar ed Dowleh), who was preferred by the Russians, and only three votes for Qawam es Sultaneh. '25. Hakimi presented his Cabinet to the Shah on the 10th May. It was composed as follows :— Anushirvan Sepahbudi : Minister for Foreign Affairs. Jt Ghulam Hussein Rahnema : Education. Nasrullah Khal’atbari (Etela ul Mulk) : Agriculture. Ur. Ismail Marzban : Health. Abdul Hussein Hajir : Finance. Abul Qasim Najm : Commerce and Industry. Ibrahim Zand : War. Mustafa Adi: Without Portfolio. Hussein Ali Kamal Hedayat (Nasr ul Mulk): Without Portfolio. Nadir Arasteh : Roads. The first two in the above list were new to Cabinet rank, Rahnema being, indeed, a newcomer to political life. The last four had held posts in Bayat s preceding ministry. Khalatbari, who is over 70, had long been in retirement. Hajir was able, but was likely to be opposed by the Tudeh; and Najm, ambassador at Kabul, was expected to refuse appointment. Hakimi himself took charge of the Ministry of the Interior, while the Ministry of Justice.was placed temporarily under the direction of the Under-Secretary, Dr. Khushbin, until the return from America of Allayar Saleh, who was designated for the post. The Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs was left temporarily vacant. On the whole the ministers were considered a colourless lot, and met with little general approval. 26. The Prime Minister presented his Cabinet to the Majlis on the 13th May, and on the following day announced his programme, which included agricultural and economic reform; improvement of conditions for workers and peasants; revision of taxes; and the usual declaration of its desire to work for the consolidation of friendly relations with the Allies based on the Tripartite Treaty, the Atlantic Charter 'and the Declaration of Tehran, The Tudeh party immediately declared on principle its opposition to a Government which did not stand for a radical reorganisation of the social system; and with the Tudeh was now also an increasing number of Deputies, who for private reasons found it advisable to court Russian favour. Many Deputies, moreover, who had voted for Hakimi were annoyed that he refused to be influenced by them in his choice of ministers, and were especially disappointed that they had not secured the appoint ment of a Minister of the Interior, who would rig the forthcoming elections in their favour. The Deputies of the Right felt that the composition of the Cabinet revealed a desire on the part of the Prime Minister to propitiate the Russians. 27. The position of the Cabinet appeared therefore from the beginning to be none too secure, and its supporters did their best to postpone the taking of the vote of confidence. For a week the Majlis discussed the question of the impeach ment for alleged peculation of Taddayun, a former Minister of Food. His enemies fearing he would be acquitted,'delivered themselves of a series of fiery speeches demanding his conviction. On the 19th May the Majlis was to meet to vote on this question, but many Deputies absented themselves, and in the absence of a quorum no vote was taken. The President of the Majlis, however, took the opportunity to remind the Chamber that it had not yet discussed the new Govern ment’s programme. The debate which followed lasted about two weeks, and was marked by a number of unusually vigorous attacks on the Government by the Tudeh and their sympathisers, and' by some spirited rejoinders by their opponents. The Tudeh criticised the ruling classes and the whole existing social system; they / made the usual accusations that reactionaries were supporting the feudal tribal system and arming the tribes in the interests of imperialism. The present direction of the army was also attacked and Seyyid Zia came in for much abuse. Better relations and a new treaty with Russia were advocated. The debate, however, did not materially affect the views of the Deputies about the Government. The opposition of the Tudeh and of those Deputies who for personal reasons fear to incur Russian displeasure, could be taken for granted. The bulk of the remainder, having failed to induce Hakimi to appoint ministers to their liking, decided that a different Government might give them a better chance of re-election in the approaching elections. When, therefore, the vote was taken on the 3rd June, Hakimi received the support of only twenty-five Deputies, and resigned.28. He was succeeded by Seyyid Muhsin Sadr (Sadr ul Ashraf) who was chosen as Prime Minister by the Majlis with sixty votes, and was charged on the 6th June, by the Shah with the formation of a Government. Sadr was, however, like his predecessor, soon in difficulties with the Deputies over the selection of his ministers, particularly the Minister of the Interior, who is able to exert great influence in the elections. Nevertheless, on the 12th June, he presented his Cabinet, composed as follows, to the Shah :— ^ Prime Minister and Minister of Interior : Seyyid Muhsin badr (Sadi ul Ashraf). Finance: Mahmud Bader. Justice: Amanullah Ardalan. Industry and Mines : Abbas Quli Gulshayan. Health : Dr. Sa’ed Malek (Lughman ul Mulk). Posts and Telegraphs : Ahmad Itebar. War : Ibrahim Zand. Foreign Affairs : Anushirvan Sipahbudi. Agriculture : Dr. Nakhai. Education : Ghulam Hussein Rahnema. Minister without Portfolio : Mustafa Adi (Mansur es Sultaneh). Minister without Portfolio : Hussein Ali Kemal Hedayat (Nasr ul Mulk). All the new ministers had previously held Cabinet rank, and five of them, the Ministers of War, Foreign Affairs and Education, and the two Ministers without Portfolio were in previous Cabinet. 29. The eight Tudeh Deputies immediately declared themselves opposed to Sadr. Some thirty others also went into Opposition. They were mostly Deputies from the North, who though at heart anti-Tudeh, vote with them from fear. Dr. Musaddiq and his personal following were also among Sadr’s most bitter opponents. All the Opposition Deputies announced their intention of obstructing the Government by all means in their power. The Shah was also said to be against Sadr, and it was probably due to His Majesty’s influence that two members of the Cabinet, Itebar and Ardalan resigned within a few days. Ardalan was subsequently replaced as Minister of Justice by Ali Kemal Hedayat, one of the Ministers without Portfolio. The Shah’s opposition was believed to be due mainly to his annoyance with the Majlis for rejecting Hakimi’s Cabinet, which included some ministers of His Majesty’s choice. 30. All the newspapers under Russian influence immediately opened a vigorous campaign against the new Prime Minister, raking up the history of nearly forty years ago to accuse him of persecuting “ the freedom-lovers during the dawn of the Persian Constitution,” and declaring that he had always been a hardened reactionary. Although representatives of the pro-Government majority and of the Opposition met frequently during the next two weeks to try and find some way out of the crisis, they were unable to come to any agreement, and the minority maintained its attitude of obstruction. Whenever Sadr attempted to present his Cabinet to the Majlis the minority refused to attend, with the result that there was never the quorum required for a vote to be taken. On the 28th June prolonged discussions took place between the two opposing groups in the Majlis. The minority proposed that Sadr should resign, in which case they would be prepared to co-operate with the majority in the choice of a new Prime Minister and Cabinet. But the majority refused; and the deadlock continued. In an attempt to put an end to the crisis the Shah received representatives of the majority and of the minority, and urged them to do their utmost to find a solution without delay. But no solution was found and Sadr had not received a vote of confidence by the end of June. 31. There was a good deal of activity among the various political parties and the labour movements during the period under review. The order forbidding political demonstrations in Tehran was suspended for the 1st May in order to allow the (Soviet sponsored) Tudeh party to hold a procession in honour of the Red army. Some 5,000 people, mostly Armenians, Turks from Azerbaijan and refugees from the Caucasus took part in the demonstration, which was perfectly orderly. Similar May-Day demonstrations were held in all the main towns in Northern Persia and in Kermanshah and Hamadan. In Meshed the celebrations lasted for two days, and mounted Russian officers and about eighty soldiers with tommy-guns were on duty in the streets to protect the Tudeh party members. On the 18th May the Adalat party, which advocates a policy of reform by persuasion, and which is opposed to the Tudeh because of its Russian connexion, staged a[68—110] c 9 demonstration in Tehran to celebrate the Allied jvictoiy^n^ to dejjnand the evacuation of Persia by Allied troops, and the release -M2t^mtexifees. The meeting was attacked by members of the Tudeh, and one of the Adalat party was killed and several were injured. The police failed to intervene, possibly because the Government, at Russian instigation, had suspended the Chief of Police at Isfahan for taking action against Tudeh rioters. In retaliation Seyyid Zia’s ^supporters demonstrated on three successive days in front of the Majlis. ^ 32. In April security in Isfahan was good, and the local Russian-'] udeh campaign of intimidation against Persian officials who were striving to maintain law and order seemed to be dying down. But in the middle of May the Isfahan Tudeh leader Bahrampur returned from Tehran with a large sum of money which he used to stir up the Tudeh sympathisers, with the result that there were some clashes between them and anti-Tudeh workers in the town. On the 25th May a leader of the anti-Tudeh Labour Union of Isfahan was murdered by Tudeh ruffians. The result was a wave of resentment against the already seriously discredited Tudeh. The authorities immediately replaced the Acting Chief of Police, who was believed to be in Russian pay, by a military officer, and a number of arrests were carried out. But their failure to bring the principal instigators of the crime to book, subsequently caused a good deal of anxiety as it was felt that the Tudeh, having failed to make headway by lawful means, had now definitely- adopted a policy of terrorism. 33. During May there was increased Tudeh activity also in the Kermanshah area culminating in a strike of workmen at the refinery of the Kermanshah Petroleum Company. The strike was not a spontaneous movement caused by genuine grievances against the company, but there was every reason to believe that it was in the nature of a try-out to be followed, if successful, by more serious outbreaks among labour in Abadan and elsewhere. When it became apparent that the strike was a failure, the Tudeh press, which had hitherto been inciting the workmen, published a statement that it had not approved the strike which should be ended as soon as possible to avoid hindering the prosecution of the war against Japan. 34. Seyyid Zia’s party, the Iradey i Milli, continued to increase in numbers and activity.' It is taking steps to open branches in the provinces wherever the Tudeh is established The Tudeh and other Left-wing papers continued regularly to attack Seyyid Zia as the agent of imperialism and a would-be dictator'. At the end of June, the Seyyid retorted with a violent counter-attack in a speech in which he accused the Tudeh of being the tools of the Russians. Persian Press and Public Opinion, and Soviet Influence. 35. There have been a number of casualties among the press at the hands of the military governor of Tehran during the period under review. These suppressions have caused the press to protest at the alleged illegal activities of the military governor and to demand the abrogation of the military governorship. In fact, the military government has little authority or power behind it, and the position of the military governor, subject as he is to the whims and caprices of the general officer commanding, the Minister of War, the Court and the Cabinet, any of whom may throw him over on any given point, is instable. This lack of security of tenure has been reflected in a lack of consistency in his treat ment of the press. A further factor making for the unsatisfactory working of the military government is the, at times, severe pressure put on the Government and/or the military government by the Soviet Embassy to take restrictive measures against papers which have incurred the displeasure of the Soviet authorities, pressure which few Governments have the courage to resist. The result has been that the military government has not observed the strictest impartiality towards the press. Bitter and distorted attacks on Great Britain have been passed over, whereas papers containing relatively objective accounts of Russian activities in Persia and Communist doctrines have been suppressed at the demand of the Russian Embassy. Further, the period of suppression of any given paper has tended to be lengthy or brief according to whether it was opposed or supported by the Soviet Embassy. 36. The end of the war in Europe was welcomed by the press and the public. The general tendency was to ignore the war in the Far East and to assume that world ‘conditions would return to normal in the immediate future. The Tudeh press warned that the fight against fascism would go on, and, somewhat ominously, tried to make out that fascism and international reaction, having been beaten in Europe, were, in their death-throes, trying to establish themselves in countries ii * •-&gt; Isuch as Persia. The end of the war in Europe was followed by demands from all sections of the press for the release of the internees, and, except for the Freedon Front, by a demand for the evacuation of the country by the Allied forces. In many cases it was argued that the Tripartite Treaty did not cover the war with Japan, and that in any case Persia’s services to the Allies could be fittingly rewarded by an early evacuation of the country. 37* The chief cleavage in the press has been between the Ireedom hront^ composed of Tudeh papers and those papers which, while not officially belonging U the Tudeh party, often take up a more violent, tendencious and uncompromisingly “anti-imperialist,’ i.6., anti-British, attitude than the Tudeh press itself and the papers which support Seyyid Zia. The position of the Independence front has been somewhat weakened by the loss of some of its members to the pro- Seyyid Zia group. A bitter struggle has been waged between the Freedom Front and the pro-Seyyid Zia group, in which accusations and counter-accusations, - ticularly with regard to alleged interference by British and Soviet officials in t k elections for the 14th Majlis, have been banded to and from with, on the part of the Freedom Front, little regard for truth. Seyyid Zia is described as an imperialist agent who has been brought back to Persia with a mission to fulfil. The freedom Front have been at pains to show that they consider Persia indivisible and have tried to convince the public that it was Seyyid Zia and the reactionai ics 01 imperialists who wished to divide Persia into northern and southern zones. ^ 38. The tone of the Freedom Front press has been hostile to Great Britain, whether she is referred to openly or written of under the thinly-veiled disguise of “ international imperialism ’’ or “ international reaction, &amp;c. An incident which occurred at the beginning of the period under review, when some Persian wlre-stealers were shot by an Indian patrol near Tehran, was the pretext for a number of bitter and provocative articles, in which Indians were attacked as the “slaves” of British imperialists and sinister motives were attributed to British colonial and the alleged imperialist policy of Great Britain. The state ment by Mr. Richard Law in the House of Commons on British interests in the south of Persia was also seized upon by the Freedom f ront to make fantastic allegations about the alleged machinations of British policy in the Middle East The main theme was Persia as the outpost of India and the wicked intrigues of the reactionaries to preserve their imperial interests, no matter what the cost to others, whether by keeping Persia in a backward and miserable condition, or bv encouraging an autonomous movement in Ivurdistan, Arab Federation or an Islamic Union to combat growing Russian influence in the Middle Fast. Mr Churchill’s first election broadcast and recent events in Syria were also grist to the Freedom Front mill. The violent abuse of “ international reaction ’ and of Seyyid Zia, and the, at times, exceedingly flimsy grounds upon which these attacks are based, coupled with the insistence by the Russian Embassy on the suppression of certain papers may, perhaps, be taken as an indication that the counter-campaign in the pro-Seyyid Zia and Independence Front papeis against the Tudeh and their Soviet masters has been more effective than they care for. 39. The official organ of the Tudeh party, Rahbar, has had articles stating that Bahrein was an integral part of Persia and that all changes made b\ a servile'Majlis under Reza Shah were invalid. Zafar, the official organ of the Workmen’s Union, has consistently attacked the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company for alleged maltreatment of workers. . 1 40. In internal problems, e.g., the successive Cabinet crises and the Majlis crisis, the line-up of the press has followed similar lines : the Freedom Front on the one side and the pro-Seyyid Zia and Independence Front papers on the other. The keynote of the two' last-named groups has been one of anxiety over the internal economic and political situation. The serious nature of the financial situation and the danger of unemployment have been emphasised, though few constructive proposals have been made to remedy the situation. As for the political situation, a growing fear is evinced of possible attempts by the army and Court to reimpose dictatorship. 41. Public opinion has been preoccupied with the unsettled condition of the country, and has looked with growing apprehension on the struggle between the Tudeh and Seyyid Zia, largely because the support which the Soviet authorities have given the Tudeh party has, in recent weeks, beep becoming more open. While many are prepared in private to praise the activities of Seyyid Zia and the trenchant' articles in the press exposing Soviet activities in Persia and the true nature of the Communist regime, there is a lively fear lest these may not provoke the Russians to even greater interference in the internal affairs of the country. The general tendency is to wish to buy the Russians off by[68—110] c 2 11 compromise, pending a clarification of the world situation. As usual, the Persian tries to shift responsibility from his own to someone else’s shoulders : the fate of Persia, in his view, depends, not on the actions of the Persians themselves, but upon the attitude taken towards Russia’s demands in Europe by Britain, and, to a lesser extent, by America. It is to Europe that the anxious ey es 01 the Persians are now turned. Fhe Tribes and Soviet Activities among Ihem. 42. Except in western Azarbaijan (northern Kurdistan) the tribal situation has been satisfactory during the first half of the year. Ihere have been minor ebullitions and instances of banditry, but the disorders that usually accompany the tribal migration were hardly noticeable this year. But the elements of disorder are still there, easily provoked by political agitators or corrupt administration. 43. In northern Kurdistan the attitude of the tribes has been causing the Persian Government much concern. For a long time past the Soviet authorities have prevented the Persian Government from taking any measures to enforce their authority, with the result that the tribes from Mahabad to Maku are practically a law unto themselves, except in so far as they are restrained by Russian officials. For a time endeavours were made to induce the Kurds to join the Tudeh party, but Tudeh principles found little favour in the eyes of Kurdish chiefs. Russian support is now reported to have been transferred to the movement for Kurdish independence, known as Komala, which seems to be gaining ground rapidly. The Persian Government expects to be faced, on the withdrawal of Russian troops, with a very serious situation in western Azarbaijan, and there is little ground for hope that they will be proved wrong. 44. In eastern Azarbaijan the hitherto patriotic Shahsavan tribes have been shocked by the impotence of the Persian Government to prevent the arrest and enforced detention in Tabriz by the Soviet authorities of two of their chiefs, whose only crime was opposition to the Tudeh party. 45. Little progress has been made with the collection of the large number of arms in the hands of tribes and others. A thousand or so have recently been seized in southern Kurdistan, mostly from settled tribes and villagers. Tribal Lands. 46. At long last Sheikh Chassib, the eldest son of the late Sheikh Khazaal of Mohammerah reached Tehran from Bagdad and joined his brothers and sisters in their efforts to get the Persian Arbitration Commission to decide in their favour a distribution of lands or allotment of revenue from the large landed property seized from their father after his arrest in 1925. It looks as if the five arbitrators want to give an indecisive finding, or one that does not show up the Persian Government’s (or rather the late Reza Shah’s) gains in this sordid transaction. Persian A rmy. 47. Some efforts are being made by the present Chief of the General Staff, General Arfa, to improve the morale of the rank and file. An order forbidding corporal punishment has recently been issued. Soldiers’ clubs are being formed at formation headquarters; and insistence on the necessity for a general improvement of management has resulted in the soldier receiving in some formations a larger proportion of the rations to which he is entitled. But officers still remain seriously underpaid, and while this lasts honesty cannot be expected. The current year’s budget has not yet been presented to the Majlis, and the army lives on periodical grants of a fraction of last year’s inadequate budget. The present Chief of the General Staff is patriotic, professionally well qualified and sincerely desirous of improving the efficiency of the army, but he cannot refrain from dabbling in politics, partly because he is convinced that he can play a part in rallying patriotic elements to make a stand against Russian infiltration via the Tudeh party and partly because he feels obliged to seek support among Deputies and journalists against the intrigues and calumnies of his enemies. Mutual jealousies and individual and faction animosities, encouraged by Tudeh and Russian intrigues, take up much of the time of senior officers and are a great handicap to progress. The Russians are hostile to the present Chief of the General Staff and to the officers he has appointed to the senior ranks of the army. The Tudeh party tries hard to attract the sympathies12 S' of junior officers and non-commissioned officers, with some success, it is believed. In spite of all this some slight general improvement is noticeable in the troops in the capital. In the northern provinces of Khorassan and Azarbaijan the troops are entirely demoralised by the high-handed actions of the Russian authorities who allow them no liberty of action, restrict them to certain defined areas and insist on the limitation of their numbers to what amounts to little more than token forces, which add nothing to the authority c£~ r ^ prestige of the Persian Government; rather do they make the Persian authorities look ridiculous. 48. The influence of General Ridley and his mission in any matters other | than supply is less and less in evidence. The term of their contract ended in March of this year, but at the request of the Persian Government the United States Government has allowed them to stay on for the time being. Gendarmerie. 49. The gendarmerie, except in the capital, remains much where it has been for the last three years—corrupt, inefficient, creating rather than preventing disorder; and Colonel Schwarzkopf’s schemes, rules and regulations are, with a few exceptions, still on paper. Antagonism between the army and the gendarmerie has been steadily increasing, and parties sent out by both forces to pursue robbers have more than once come to blows with each other. Co-operation between the two forces is rare. The retransfer of the gendarmerie to the control and administration of the War Office is now receiving some serious consideration. Such a step should lead to economy and might lead to improved security. 50. Gendarmerie District Headquarters have been abolished except in Pars and Azarbaijan, and gendarmerie regiments are now under the direct command of Gendarmerie Headquarters in Tehran. This will complicate the relations of the Governor-General with the gendarmerie in his province: he previously had the district commander with him at the provincial capital. Police. * 51. As Russian provocation of the proletariat through the Tudeh party and, consequently, the probabilities of disturbance and riots in the towns increase so does the police force become less capable of maintaining order. Always corrupt, it has now reached incredible depths of venality and inefficiency. Many of its officers are in the pay of one or other of the money-making rackets or one or other of the political parties. No impartial action can then be expected in the treatment of any situation. For this state of affairs successive Govern ments are, of course, primarily to blame. Even if an energetic and capable chief of police were to be found he would be frustrated by the pusillanimity and inefficiency of Ministers. Only a mission of foreign officers with adequate powers, which once granted can be exercised independently of changes in Government, and adequate funds at their disposal can be expected to turn the Persian police force into an instrument for the impartial suppression of disorder, and even they, as the experience of the American officers with the gendarmerie has shown, will have no easy task. The quality of the Persian police is of particular interest to His Majesty’s Government since it is on that force that reliance must, in the first instance,' be placed for the protection of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company labour against intimidation and subversive provocation. Persian Air Force. 52. Under the personal stimulus of the Shah, there has been a good deal of talk about modernising and expanding the air force. The advice of the Royal Air Force as to equipment, training and organisation has been sought and in great measure taken, but in view of the chronically meagre air force vote progress is not likely to be rapid. 53. Meanwhile, there is some superficial improvement in day to day work, but morale under Brigadier Khosrovani remains bad. Civil A ir Lines in Persia. 54. The Iranian State Airline, under the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs j and Telephones, now operates two return services a week to Bagdad via Kermanshah and one to Bushire via Isfahan and Shiraz. Passengers are not (officially) carried south of Isfahan pending the installation of wireless facilities on this section of the route.55. The Persian commercial company talks a lot but has done nothing. No more has been heard of the rumoured Russo-Persian company. The Russian so-called official services between Tehran and Meshed are well filled with Persian commercial traffic as are those to Pahlevi and Tabriz, which, however, appear to be running less regularly than last summer. 56. The Americans claim to have applied to the Persian Government for ghts to operate an official commercial service between Bagdad and Tehran to supplement and gradually replace the military services of the United States Air Transport Corps. The French military line continues to carry civilians and has been detected in some dubious practices about visas. The three British Overseas Airways Corporation services a week to Bagdad, Lydda and Cairo are well filled with official load and private travellers can seldom be accommodated. Finance. 57. The budget results for the Persian year 1323 (21st March, 1944— 20th March, 1945) showed a surplus on the ordinary budget of 81 million rials and a deficit on the commercial budget of 543 million rials, making a net deficit of 462 million rials. The total deficit in 1322 was 1,052 million rials. These not unsatisfactory results were due mainly to the efforts of Dr. Millspaugh and his mission. The future prospects now that Dr. Millspaugh has gone are uncertain, especially as the first item on the financial programme of any Government will now be the revision of the income tax law. 58. The Persian Government, following the fall in the London price of gold announced on the 9th June, duly applied for the adjustment of their sterling Balances under article 8 of the Financial Agreement. They were informed by His Majesty’s Embassy that none of the other Governments with whom His Majesty’s Government have similar payments agreements have asked for a similar adjustment, the change in price being the result of the reduction in insurance and transport costs to the United States; but that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to adjust their balances if the Persian Government considered it was right to ask for this adjustment. 59. The scarcity of dollars led in June to the National Bank refusing to open dollar credits for goods ordered from the United States. Following 'this action the Foreign Trade Control Division and the Middle East Supply Centre, Tehran, stopped issuing licences for American goods pending arrangements for the proper utilisation of Persia’s dollar resources. Hitherto, the Persian Government have taken no steps to gain possession of dollars in private hands nor to obtain control of the dollars accruing from current exports to the United States. The price of dollars on the free market rose to rials fifty (compared with the official rate of rials thirty-two). Economic Situation. 60. ihe Economic Organisation set up to take over the economic depart ments of the Government set up by Dr. Millspaugh, functioned rather better than was at first expected, thanks mainly to the legacy of organisation and routine left by the Americans and to the continued presence of many members of the Millspaugh Mission. For all its shortcomings the Economic Organisation was able to maintain the essential economic services in operation at a time when Cabinet crises would have paralysed these departments had the Economic Organisation not existed. The British cereals and transport teams also continued to function. The future of both the Americans and the British in the economic departments is, however, uncertain, and it is unlikely that they will remain much longer. Corruption and confusion in the issue of import licences increased considerably during the quarter, the tendency being for obscure firms to get licences at the expense of the established importers. The British, United States and Indian Trade representatives have now intervened jointlv to try and effect an improvement in this situation. 61. Markets showed no spectacular movements in spite of the end of the war in Europe. It was greeted on the whole without enthusiasm by the merchants, who have had a profitable war and see the days of big profits receding. Exports of carpets, gum and skins to the United States were stimulated by the high premium on dollars. The sale of gold was discontinued by the National Bank on the 22nd May; but the market remained quite active and a steady export to Iran and Syria continued until late in the quarter.Disposal of British and American Military Installations. 62. A list of British and joint Anglo-American fixed military installations declared surplus was communicated to the Persian Government, who were invited to state which of them they were interested in buying. The chief of these assets are the Port of Bandar Shapur and the military telephone-line system. It seems very unlikely that the Persians will be able to pay cash, and the terms under which credit would be granted to enable the Persian Government to raise the^- necessary money over the next few years are under discussion with the Americans. Insistence on payment in dollars has held up American disposals, and it seems likely that the United States authorities will agree to allow the Persians time in which to make the conversion from rials to dollars. Conversion difficulties should not arise in the case of payment for British assets. Handing Back of the British-American Run Section of the Persian State Railway. 63. The return of the railway south of Tehran from British and American to Persian control was completed by the end of June. British de facto respon sibility for keeping the railway financially solvent ended on the 1st July, but the British army are prepared to make payments to cover the deficit in the southern section of the line up to the end of September. British and American property on the railway has been handed over to the Persians on a “ use, care and main tenance ” basis. The future of lend-lease rolling-stock has not yet been decided by Washington, but it is hoped that enough will be offered to the Persians to allow the railway to continue to operate efficiently. The Soviet Embassy have not yet announced their readiness to begin negotiations with the British and the Persians to cover the use of the railway by the Allies during the period the 1st September, 1941, to the 30th June, 1945, though the Persians are pressing for this agreement. There have been no signs that the Russians intend to follow the Anglo-American example and hand back the northern section of the line to Persian control before the expiry of the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of Allinace. Cereals Situation. 64. By the end of June the total collections of bread-grains in Persia amounted to 204,000 tons, of which 134,000 was wheat. Reports show that this harvest will be a monster one. A joint Anglo-American enquiry of the Soviet Embassy suggesting the export of food-grains drew a dog-in-the-manger reply deprecating the idea “ at this stage.” So now the Persian Government must decide whether they will openly ask the assistance of the Americans and British to get rid of the anticipated surplus of some 100,000 tons of rather high-priced wheat, or bow to the bullying of the Russians and risk a real glut and distress amongst the cultivators, who will not be able to dispose of their coming grain- harvest. Locust Control. 65. This quarter saw the conclusion of the campaign in South Persia, which had been operated by a Middle East anti-locust unit. Although infestation over many parts, notably Bandar Abbas, was large, control was effective and no damage to crops occurred. This speaks highly for the administration of the campaign, since the difficulties vis-a-vis the Persian locust officers and labour were many. Usually, the Persian officers’ reports of the area infested were greatly exag gerated, in order that they could obtain greater quantities of bait than would be necessary, and sell that which they could not use. Accounts and figures were purposely falsified, until checked by the British Locust Officer. 66. It is understood that no Middle East anti-locust unit will operate in Persia next year. Economic Warfare. 67. The quarter under review has been marked by the relaxation of controls. The Statutory List for Persia has been reduced to five names. The Black List for Persia has ceased to operate and the sole name on it has been deleted. 68. New regulations concerning trade with Switzerland have been intro duced. New A merican A mbassador. 69. Mr. Leland Morris left Tehran on the 19th May, and his successor, Mr. Wallace Murray, presented his letters to the Shah on the 5th June.rs 15 70. Mr. Murray seems friendly, and if he still retains the SL1 fC4^i9^ ' British imperialism, which he certainly used to possess, he show^np at &lt; present, though whether it has been dissipated by experience or merely out weighed by his greater suspicion of Russia can only be surmised. Mr. Murray is certainly outspoken in his indignation at the methods which Russia is usin^ in Eastern Europe and in Persia, and by his attitude he is helping to put heart into -^he Persian Government. He is, however, rather timorous of making even the slightest move without instructions from the State Department, and even in seeking instructions he seems rather to leave it to the State Department to decide instead of suggesting the course that the local situation seems to call for. How ever, he is a great improvement on his two predecessors, and if only his apparent aim in life was not to make ten words grow where one grew before, I should regard him as a very good colleague. Polish Evacuees. 71. During the period under review the evacuation of Polish refugees from Persia was almost at a standstill, since shipping to Persian Gulf Ports has been greatly reduced owing to the diminution of “ Aid to Russia.” Only seventy-eight Poles left Persia, travelling overland to Beirut. This left a total of 3,798 in Persia at the end of June. 72. Hitherto, the Poles had, on the whole, been reluctant to leave Persia for more distant destinations, since they hoped to return home soon. As, however, the prospects of a Soviet-controlled Poland appeared to them to increase, their fear of being deported by force to Poland increased also, and most of them longed to leave Persia for any destination. It was unfortunate, therefore, for them that shipping difficulties should have arisen at the same moment. Indian Affairs. 73. The previous enthusiasm shown by the Persians at the Jndo-Iranian Cultural Society’s weekly meetings began to flag because of the chaotic state of politics in Persia, which left prominent Persians with insufficient time to devote both to their political futures and to the society. However, by dint of hard work the Attache for Indian Affairs succeeded in sending off four out of the five students selected for the Delhi Polytechnic courses in textile and ordinary engineering. 74. In May the society entertained a number of guests at a lecture on India and Persia given by C. P. Skrine, Esq., His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, and illustrated by excellent coloured and monochrome cine-ffims. 75. The English classes given by Indian teachers at Meshed, Yezd and Kerman continued to have somewhat poor attendance. The teacher for Ahwaz arrived in the middle of the “ hot weather ” and found it difficult to settle down. In consultation with the British Council he (and in turn the teachers from Kerman and Yezd) will attend “ refresher ” courses at the Anglo-Persian Institute in Tehran during July and August. A newly arrived second teacher at Meshed seems to have the gift of collecting pupils and of keeping them interested in his English lessons. Indian Trade. 76. Major M. Hassan, the first Indian Government Trade Commissioner to be appointed to Persia, arrived here on the 12th June. It will be some time before his office starts functioning properly as he has still to receive his staff and his office equipment from India. 77. The Government of India are planning to stage a commercial-cum- cultural exhibition regarding India and Indian manufactured goods in Tehran in the spring of 1946. It would also be shown in other important centres of the country. British Propaganda Activities. 78. It will be recalled that on the 21st March this embassy voluntarily gave up its propaganda broadcasts from Radio Tehran. Public reaction has been negligible. A few polite letters of regret have been received. The continued use by the Russians of their “ cultural ” time on Tehran Radio to broadcast objection able, or at least controversial, material is sufficient justification alone for our withdrawal before foreign broadcasts become so unpopular as to force the Persians to stop them altogether.16 British Council. 79. As the Public Relations Bureau of this embassy has been reducing its activities with the end of the war in Europe, the Council has had to reassure the Persian community that its work here will continue after the war. Persistent requests continue for the establishment of English teachers in country districts, and in some cases local eagerness has led to the formation of groups of voluntary English teachers. Unfortunately the Council has not got the staff to assist. 86. French, Russian and American competition in cultural matters is on the increase. 81. Distinguished visitors during the quarter were : Professor Davies, of London University, who inspected technical colleges in Persia and delivered lectures on British engineering; and Professor Boase, of Hertford College, Oxford (Middle East representative of the council), who delivered lectures on mediaeval English illumination. Professor Zaehner, of Christ Church, Oxford, who is a member of this embassy’s Public Relations Bureau, delivered a lecture on Oscar Wilde. The council's dramatic club produced the play “ Granite” by Clemence Dane.* t PILE copy THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY QP HIS HRITANlftC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT A — — TEXT -+ WDEXPO With th PERSIA.

Internal Politics and Relations with the Soviet Union. 1. At the beginning of the year the Government, under the pressuie of a Soviet-inspired propaganda campaign demanding that steps be taken to increase employment, issued a circular to all the provinces promising extensive administrative and social reforms, including the passing of measures leading up to the creation of provincial councils, the improvement of the condition ot rural and industrial workers, radical reform of Government departments, enforce ment of the free compulsory education law, and plans for the development of agriculture and industry and for the exploitation of underground resources. 2. At the same time the Prime Minister, in an effort to placate the Russians in connexion with the oil concession dispute, informed the Soviet Ambassador that the Persian Government intended to form a Persian company for oil exploration, employing if possible Persian experts for the work. If these were not available, then “ neutrals ” were to be engaged ; and failing them, the Persian Government -would apply for experts to the Soviet (government. The Soviet Ambassador was reported to have shown little enthusiasm over these proposals, but to have promised reluctantly to inform his Government. 3. Under the new oil law the Prime Minister should have informed the- Majlis of these proposals, but he did not do so for fear lest the ensuing controversy might wreck any dhance of an agreement. It was not long, however, before rumours that he had been in negotiation with the Soviets began to arouse the suspicions of those Deputies who considered Bayat capable of going too far in his promises to the Russians. Many Deputies, indeed, believed that Bayat, on assuming office, had made two defihite promises to the Russians : (1) that he would get rid of Dr. Millspaugh, and (2) that he would induce the Majlis to reconsider the law passed in December making it illegal for any Persian Government to give an oil concession to any foreign Government or company. On the whole, Bayat had the House with him over the Millspaugh question, although there were some Deputies who subsequently considered that by depriving Millspaugh of his economic powers he bad caused the situation to deteriorate. (Tor a report of the Millspaugh question see below). But those Deputies who opposed con cessions to the Soviets were now determined to get rid of Bayat. They were joined by others who, having used Bayat to get rid of Millspaugh, were ready to turn Bayat himself out. As a result there was a realignment of ‘ ‘ fractions in the Majlis. The largest fraction, the Ittehadi Milli, to which the Prime Minister had himself belonged, split into two groups, one in support of and the other opposed to him. The “ Mihan ” fraction, which, together with the “ Ittehadi Milli,” had been responsible for bringing Bayat to power, now openly opposed him. Of the other fractions, the “Democrats” also opposed Bayat, whereas the “ Mustaquill ” and many of the independents and even the Tudeh were inclined to support him. Bayat had in fact lost the support of the more conservative elements of the Majlis who had chosen him as Prime Minister and seemed increasingly dependent on his erstwhile opponents of the Left to keep him in office. But his position had become very shaky in the process, and there was much talk of his imminent departure. Among those mentioned as possible successors were Qawam es Saltaneh, who is always a candidate; Soheily, who, however, has not yet been exonerated from charges of corruption, undue influence, &amp;c.; and Mehdi Quli Hayat, who is eighty. But the Deputies failed to agree about the choice of a new Prime Minister and Bayat firmly refused to resign. [66—57] Vo-o AM AdUJtCj RECC. P 0 &gt;- 1 3 JULIES INDIA L L4. Various incidents which occurred during this period were cited by Bayat’s opponents as evidence that he had gone over to the Soviet side. He was, for instance, severely criticised for allowing the Irano-Soviet Cultural Society to broadcast from .Radio Tehran a translation of an article in the Pravda attacking Seyyid Zia-ud-Din Tabataba’i (the former Persian Prime Minister who came back two years ago after 20 years’ exile in Palestine), and containing the scarcely veiled calumny that he was the tool of the British. Much unfavour able comment was also aroused when the Prime Minister held an official reception to celebrate the 27th anniversary of the Red army and invited the diplomatic corps to attend. A story that two of his Ministers attended a memorial ceremony at the grave of the Communist, Dr. Irani, though subsequently denied by one of them, gave ground for adverse criticism. In the matter of the press, too, Bayat was considered, with some reason, to lean to the Soviet side. Nevertheless, though he was inclined to truckle to the Russians in small matters there was no definite evidence that he had given way on the oil or any other essential question. His supporters in the Majlis in fact claimed that he had, by giving way on non- essentials, succeeded in improving Perso-Soviet relations; and according to some reports the Shah was inclined to agree with Bayat and to encourage him to remain in office in spite of increasing opposition in the Majlis. In this His Majesty was possibly influenced by the fact that in reply to a protest made some weeks earlier about Soviet behaviour in the north, the Soviet Embassy sent the Persian Government a conciliatory note disclaiming any intention to interfere in Persia’s internal affairs. 5. Little serious business was transacted by the Majlis during this period. In January a quarrel between two Deputies, one of whom accused the other of using his position to gain commercial advantages for himself, led to the adoption by the chamber of a Bill authorising the appointment of a committee of five members to examine all accusations made in the press or Parliament against individual Deputies. Two Bills tabled by the Minister of Health were passed: one empowered the Ministry of Health to enforce health regulations previously enforced by the Ministry of Interior, and the other concerned the reorganisation of the Ministry of Health. New legislation tabled but not yet passed by the end of March included a Bill for the restoration to their rightful owners of properties confiscated from tribes and other landowners; two Bills for the development of agriculture and the formation of agricultural councils; a new labour law; and a Bill for the prohibition of the use or cultivation of opium. 6. There was a good deal of party activity and labour agitation during the period under review. The Tudeh intensified their propaganda particularly in the south. Their leaders indeed openly said that as their activities in the north were attributed to Soviet instigation they intended in future to improve their organisations in those parts of Persia not occupied by Soviet troops. They therefore established a centre in Shiraz where they published two papers and began an active campaign against those whom they believed, or professed to believe, to be British agents, notably Qawam ul Mulk and Nasir Qashqai. In Ahwaz, too, the arrival of a new Soviet consul was followed by a strike in the local factory. But it was in Isfahan and Yezd that the Tudeh made their most determined efforts. Tudeh Deputies from Tehran visited Isfahan in January and February to try to strengthen fheir domination over the local trades unions. In this, however, in spite of the energetic support of the Soviet Consul, they were remarkably unsuccessful. Anti-Tudeh interests, mostly mill-owners, succeeded in setting up a rival trades union. After a period of unrest, with demonstrations , and clashes between supporters of the rival parties, the local Persian authorities, who handled the situation very well, succeeded in re-establishing order, and the [upshot of it all was that the bulk of the workers declared themselves,’ at least for the time being, definitely anti-Tudeh. At the end of March there was further trouble and during an anti-Tudeh demonstration the crowd wrecked the Tudeh offices. At Yezd, too, the Tudeh suffered a reverse when their agents were attacked and driven out of the town by the crowd, who also set fire to the Tudeh headquarters. The Azerbaijan branches of the Tudeh held their first congress at Tabriz in January. This was followed by a Tudeh recruiting drive amono- the townsfolk of Tabriz, the peasants and the Kurdish tribes. ' In Hamadan and Kermanshah, too, there was an attempt to gain adherents to the Tudeh, but without great success. 7. In Tehran the general opinion was that the Tudeh had lost ground ever since the demonstration of October last had revealed that the Tudeh was not altogether a genuine Persian Left-wing movement but a political organisation largely under Soviet control. When the Tudeh advertised a demonstration in Tehran for the 2nd March, the Military Governor showed a bold front, and3 the demonstration was called off. In Azerbaijan, too, there were signs towards the end of March that the local Tudeh leaders were drawing in their horns and « | , trying to restrain the activities of their more unruly followers. But in Meshed towards the end of March there was renewed Tudeh activity when their leaders harangued the crowds in the streets after scores of Soviet tommy-gunners had been patrolling the streets. 4* 8. In February Seyyid Zia published the programme of his party, called the “ National Will ” party, which he now declared open. In spite of violent attacks in all the Soviet-inspired press, and in many other newspapers, Seyyid Zia and his cause appeared to be making good progress, at least in Tehran, where it was claimed that by the end of March the party had between nine and ten thousand adherents. 9. On the 4th March Dr. Musaddiq, one of Bayat's principal supporters, accused the Majlis of condoning corruption and left the Assembly declaring he would not take his seat again. Two days later, however, he allowed himself to be escorted to the Majlis by a crowd of students who tried to force their way in. In the ensuing disturbance one student was killed and a few people were hurt. Bayat himself and other members of the Government were widely accused of complicity in this demonstration against the “ reactionary Majlis. But the incident did Bayat no good and greatly increased the criticism against his Government. Finally, on the 18th March, representatives of the “ Mihan,” “ Mustaqill,” “ Democrat,” and part of the “ Ittehadi Mill! ” fractions called on the Shah to inform His Majesty that the majority of the Deputies no longer supported Bayat and to request His Majesty to advise him to resign. The Shah was, however, reluctant to dismiss Bayat, and expressed the opinion that his Government should continue in office at laast until after the No Ruz holidays. 10. Bayat and his Government in fact were still in office at the end of March, owing largely to the lack of cohesion and determination of his opponents; and the Majlis, having adjourned for the No Ruz holidays, did not meet again before the end of the period under review owing to the lack of a quorum. Soviet Oil Claim and the Yalta Conference. 11. Towards the end of March the embassy were authorised to make to 4 4 the Persian Government, in reply to their numerous enquiries as to the extent to which Persian affairs had been discussed at Yalta, an unofficial and oral com munication in the following terms :— * « “ Persian affairs, though not on the agenda of the conference, were dis cussed briefly; and while there was no sign that the Russians had abandoned their desire for an oil concession, there was such complete agreement as to the maintenance of the independence and integrity of Persia that it would have been superfluous to repeat the declarations already made on this subject.” 12. In point of fact the Russians at Yalta had adopted a very unforthcom ing and aggrieved attitude where Persia was concerned, repeating many of their earlier mis-statements regarding the circumstances of the oil concession crisis and flatly rejecting all suggestions for an agreed official statement on Persia. Never theless the brief discussions on this subject probably served to convince the Soviet Government that any overt pressure with a view to securing a reversal of the oil decision would adversely affect their relations with Great Britain and the United States ; and, while of course they hotly denied that any such pressure was being exercised, it was noticeable that a short while after the close of the conference the Persian newspapers controlled by the Soviet Embassy gradually ceased their agitation for the cancellation of Dr. Musaddiq’s oil law. Anglo-Soviet-Persian Censorship. 13. The Anglo-Soviet censorship “war,” waged throughout the greater part of the period under review with increasing intensity, resulted in a complete victory for the British side. 14. Late in the summer of 1944 a proposal had been made in general terms to the Soviet Ambassador that a truce should be called to “ ideological censor ship.” British retaliatory measures had at that time hardly begun to inconveni- , , ence the Russians, and although M. Maximov undertook to transmit the proposal to Moscow for consideration it is doubtful whether he did so. 15. On the 26th January the proposal was reiterated in a more detailed and concrete form. It was suggested that both sides should cease to censor all incom ing printed matter published in English or Russian and posted, through the intermediary of officially-approved agencies, by publishing firms in the United [66—57] b 24 Kingdom and British Dominions, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States. . . -n - 4 -- i. -a 16. Meanwhile retaliatory pressure was maintained on the British side. This was never comparable to the Russian censorship activity in extent, and was indeed confined largely to the protection of the Polish Government in London from the more outrageous of Soviet slanders. It involved, however, the holding up of several issues of the Pravda and one of the actions which t e ^ Soviet Ambassador evidently regarded as unspeakably shocking and dithcuit to explain to his colony without loss of face. Although the Soviet section of the censorship and the Soviet Embassy had met all protests on our side with a con- sistant refusal to justify or explain their actions, M. Maximov protested strongly against these British counter-measures and demanded explanations. He was merely informed that his protests had been referred to London. 17 On the 6th March the Soviet censor agreed orally to the proposals described above, and large quantities of British, American and Russian printed matter, previously held up, were thereupon released. He announced moreover his intention of interpreting his responsibilities liberally m respect of publications in languages other than English and Russian, with the possible exception of 1 oils . So far he has been as good as his word, and we have followed suit. Relations between the British and Soviet censors were immediately restored to the highest level of cordiality, the Russians, true to their national psychology, having accepted defeat without the slightest trace of resentment. • * a u 18 Unsuccessful attempts were made to extract from the Soviet Ambassador a written acceptance of the British proposal. It is always very difficult to get anything in writing from the Soviet authorities, but M. Maximov was probably embarrassed by the fact that he had stipulated in conversation for the continued suppression of attacks on Heads of States (a stipulation to which there is of course no objection so long as it is reasonably interpreted), and did not wish to put this point in writing because—presumably—it was not contained in his mstructio ^ P 19 It proved impossible, during the period under review, to obtain a square deal for the Polish legation in the matter of broadcasting over ^e Tehran radio the Russians continued to reject the legation’s material submitted for censorship and to evade censorship of the so-called Polish Patriots’ radio propa ganda by sponsoring it themselves. Until the closing down of British broad casting from the Tehran station it might have been possible to redress the balance bv copying the Soviet Embassy’s methods; but the increasingly difficult attitude adopted b? the Polish Government after the Yalta Conference made it inadvisable to adopt a form of drastic retaliation which would m any case have been effective for a short period only. The Poles, however, discovered a soiutmn of their own when the British broadcasts from Tehran ceased They found t^tthePersiaii radio authorities were willing to allow the Poles to broadcast official Polish *“ hat h . ld not been censored by the Russians (or by the British) and two or three such bulletins have in fact been broadcast without the Russians raising any objection. The Poles have promised not to be provocative, so we are turni g a blind eye to the broadcasts. Aid to Russia. 20. The total “Aid to Russia’’ review was :— January— Rail Trucks February— Rail Trucks March—* Rail Trucks cargo carried during the period under Long tons. 102,009 36,603 138,612 83,779 50,728 134,507 60,766 20,927 81,693 trucks plus their The tonnages shown for trucks are the weight of the assembled cargo. t 4 * J ■ £5 4 21. Overseas cargo for Russia via Persia has diminished very rapidly, so much so that it is now being carried as part cargo on occasional ships from the United Kingdom, United States, India and Ceylon. Aviation spirit and alkylate (material to convert ordinary into aviation spirit) from the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company refineries at Abadan now form an important part of the traffic. Thus, of the 60,000 tons carried by rail in March, 47,000 were Anglo- ^ Iranian Oil Company products. ^ 22. 3,000 tons per month of fuel oil has continued to be supplied from Abadan to the northern (Soviet operated) section of the Persian railways to make up the quantities not supplied from Baku. 23. During March the general truck assembly plant at Khorramshahr was dismantled and despatched through Persia to a Black Sea port. The one remaining assembly line at Khorramshahr closed down in mid-April. 24. The American Persian Gulf Command is shipping to another war theatre fifteen out of the total of fifty-seven diesel locomotives imported to assist in moving “Aid to Russia ” traffic. 25. The total number of Soviet prisoners of war returned to the Soviet Union via Persia between the 27th October, 1943, and the 25th February, 1945. was 13.063. No more will pass by this route. The Question of Withdrawal of Allied Troops. 26. This question continued to form the subject of correspondence between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Foreign Office. As stated in paragraph 19 of the last quarterly report, the embassy’s original suggestion was that British troops should be evacuated at least from Tehran as soon as the opening up of supply routes other than the Persian should render this practicable. It was hoped here that such action would lead before long to a corresponding Russian withdrawal from Tehran, since the Russians could hardly afford to face the odious comparisons which their continued presence in the capital would invite. Their propaganda in Persia depends negatively for its effect on the lip-service which they pay to the joint Allied guarantees of Persian sovereignty, and positively on the belief which they surreptitiously foster that this sovereignty is menaced only by “ the capitalist Powers.” . 27. His Majesty’s Government were not, however, in favour of even a partial British evacuation as a gesture, and considered that British troops could only be withdrawn on a pan passu basis. , ' 28. While remaining of the opinion that even the evacuation of Tehran alone by Allied troops would be better than nothing, the embassy became more and more convinced as time went on that a far more radical withdrawal was required, and required soon, if Persia were to be saved from administrative paralysis and progressive disintegration. The Russians had steadily increased their hold over the rich northern provinces within their “ zone.” The longer this process was allowed to continue, the smaller the chances would become of ever dislodging them; and unless they were dislodged no Persian Government could be expected to function as a Government should. The possibility was therefore mooted of negotiating a British withdrawal to the oilfields area in the extreme south-west with a corresponding and simultaneous Russian withdrawal of equal importance in the north. 29. At this stage, however, a complication arose. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Paiforce, considered it essential for the health of any troops retained for the protection of the oilfields that the Indian rest camp at Karind should be maintained, and that there should be a summer training camp (on which work had already been started) at Bisitun, with southward lines of communication through Khurramabad. But Karind, Kermanshah (which is 20 miles west of Bisitun) and Khurramabad lie along the northern and eastern perimeters of the British “ zone ” as defined in the letters exchanged with the Persian Government after the occupation in August 1941. The arrangements proposed by the general officer commanding-in-chief would no doubt have meant a genuine reduction in the quality or intensity of the British “occupation' #- - within large part of this zone; British troops would be much less in evidence than before. ' Nevertheless nothing short of a total withdrawal from a given area would have stood the least chance of acceptance by the Russians as a change » * requiring a corresponding change on their side. They would undoubtedly have claimed—and not without some show of logic—that the most ^they were called upon to do in these circumstances was to withdraw to “ their ” zone as defined at the same period. And this zone was only smaller than their present zone by an unimportant area of mountain and forest covering the central part of the6 Elburz range and the coastal fringe to the north of it. (The area is contained approximately within a line drawn north-east from Qazvin to another at Khurramabad, thence eastward along the Caspian coast through Aliabad to Babul, and thence south-south-east to Semnan). On this basis they would have remained in full control of Azerbaijan, Gilan and the north-eastern corner of Persia, with garrisons on the Tabriz and Meshed roads within 100 miles of Tehran on both sides of the capital. Meshed, it is true, was not included within^ the “ Soviet zone ” as defined in the Soviet-Persian exchange of letters after the occupation of the country; but on the strength of an oral declaration made by the Soviet Ambassador at that time troops were stationed on the Meshed airfield, and a moral influence was thereby established over the town which became in the course of time the practical equivalent of inclusion within the Soviet zone. The Russians would therefore in all probability have claimed to treat Meshed as part of their original zone for the purposes of any new arrangement based on the sacred principles of “equilibrium.” 30. Confronted with this dilemma, the embassy put forward the only proposal which seemed at all likely to solve it, viz., the negotiation of a total withdrawal on both sides, with special arrangements for the protection of the oilfields area, in the absence of British troops, by a police force on the lines of the Palestine police and theoretically under Persian control. It was realised that this proposal might well appear too drastic to the military authorities responsible for the security of the oilfields. But it was pointed out that the risks of sabotage by the Japanese would be very much less than the risks of sabotage by the Germans had been in the difficult days before the occupation of South Persia; and that in the last analysis a continued Soviet occupation of the north until six months after the peace with Japan was likely, by bringing about the complete disintegra tion of Persia, to deprive us of the use of the oilfields for good and all—among other and still more serious consequences. 31. This proposal was telegraphed to London on the 31st January; and there had of course been no time to consider it when the Yalta Conference took place a week later. At this conference Persian affairs, though not on the official agenda, were touched upon, and more than one attempt was made to persuade the Russians to agree to discuss the question of the withdrawal of Allied troops. The Soviet reaction was, however, completely negative and discouraging; both Marshal Stalin and M. Molotov took the line that the exact terms of the Tripartite Treaty should be adhered to and that there was consequently no advantage in discussing the question of withdrawal. 32. Commenting on this unsatisfactory result, the embassy pointed out at the beginning of March that the Russians had shown their hand. It was clear that they wished to keep their troops in Persia as long as possible in order to secure the strongest possible hold over the country before they went. The only weapon left was wdde publicity, or at least the threat of it, if the Russians maintained their obstructive attitude. 33. Such publicity w T as not sanctioned during the period under review, nor was the threat of it used; but towards the end of March the embassy were authorised to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government, so far as they were concerned, “ were not opposed to Allied examination ” to see whether some withdrawal could not be made before the treaty date for total withdrawal, i.e., the six months’ period following armistice with Japan. This communication undoubtedly did something to hearten the Persian Government, and was bound in time to confirm in the mind of the Persian public the general impression which it had already derived from the attitude of the Tudeh press, namely, that it was the Russians alone who were opposed to the early withdrawal of foreign troops. Obviously, however, the full benefit of publicity could only be obtained by revealing that His Majesty’s Government had actually proposed a withdrawal to the Soviet Government and had met with an uncompromising refusal. Such a revelation—but nothing short of it—would completely deflate the intensive and disloyal propaganda of the Soviet authorities in this country; who, through the agency of the newspapers which they control, seek to deflect attention from their own real misdeeds in the north by painting a lurid and entirely fanciful picture of the attempts of “ foreign capitalists ” to detach and swallow the south. Security. 34. The most important recent development has been an outcry in the Persian press and agitation in the Majlis against the continued internment of prominent Persians, for which the British authorities have been almost exclusively7 blamed. The clamour has taken the line that the interliees should be brought to trial under Persian law and that in any case the security danger is over and it is time for release. 35. the agitation took its rise from an incident which occurred at the lehran Internment Camp when the internees were inspected by a British sub altern. 1 his officer was assailed with abuse by an overwrought colonel, and the ' episode was interpreted in the press as a further example of British brutality. 36. In the Majlis, on the 1st February, Dr. Musaddiq questioned the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to the legal justification of the arrest and con finement of the internees and, in spite of Anglo-Russian efforts to prime the Minister with suitable powder for a reply, received a deplorably weak and inconclusive answer, which did little or nothing to damp down the agitation. 37. lo counter these developments, His Majesty’s Embassy published an official statement of the facts of the incident at the camp and released to the world press, Reuter, A.P. and U.P., the complete story of the German spies, Gametha and Mayr, and of the Melliun Society. This in turn provoked further protestation in the press, ranging from denunciation of this alleged endeavour to discredit Persia in the eyes of the United Nations and so to deny her the rewards she anticipates from San Francisco, to a flat refusal to believe the story. 38. Ihe general disloyalty of the Persian authorities was again made clear by the indulgent treatment vouchsafed to the internees in the Tehran Camp, the transfer of one of them, without authority, on grounds of sickness, from the camp to his private house, and the failure of the Government to implement a promise to reduce to the rank of major an internee who had been promoted to lieutenant-colonel. 39. As the Russians had been largely exempt from the odium incurred by the British in virtue of the continued internment of Persians, and as, although the Russian Ambassador concurred in protesting against the futility of the Foreign Minister s leply to the agitation against it, he seemed to be disposed to disclaim the Russian share of responsibility, a notice was inserted in the press by His Majesty’s Embassy, emphasising the joint responsibility of both British and Russians. His Majesty s Embassy tried to get the Soviet Embassy to agree to this action, but as they refused, were compelled to act alone. 40. On the 12th February all the Persian internees remaining in the Sultanabad Camp, except the dangerous, and very anti-British mullah, Seyvid Abul Qasim Kashani, were transferred to the Persian Internment CamiV in lehran. Kashani v'as later removed to Kermanshah. 41. The progressive release of the Persian internees in Tehran, except for a few who may have to be detained until the war with Japan is over, is now proposed by the British security authorities, and the Soviet Embassy have been asked to approve the release of the first eight. ^ i P n ^ arc h, thirteen German, Czech and other internees were removed from Sultanabad to a camp in Iraq and the Sultanabad camp was closed. r 43. On the 18th March, Sheikh Abdul Majid Shirazi, whose name has been on the Anglo-Soviet list of enemy partisans in connexion with the Mayr con spiracy, was arested by the Persian police. And on the 2nd April, Constantine Kassakowski, the last undesirable German to be at large in Persia, was arrested at Shah Reza by the gendarmerie at the request of the British authorities and handed over to the latter. British A rmy Interests. 1 , 44 -. 4n 1 th ® cours e of the last twelve months the British combatant troops in 1 ersia (which were about 11,000) were reduced by 800 men. 4 5. ^ Thefts of signal wire still continue in spite of strong protests by His Majesty s Embassy against what amounts in effect to sabotage of Allied military communications. The Persian army has taken over the protection of wire over an additional stretch west of Tehran and south of Tehran and are now r responsible for some 150 miles. 7 he Press and Public Opinion. 46. During the early part of the period under review the press and public opmmn were chiefly occupied with the crisis over the demand by the Soviet Emon for an oil concession in Northern Persia. The press, over this question was divided into two mam groups, namely the Freedom Front (i e the papers8 influenced and controlled by the Tudeh party) which in effect supported the Soviet demand, and the Independence Front papers which opposed the demand and considered the pressure being exercised by the Soviet l nion as an unwarrant able interference in the internal affairs of tne country. Certain papers, chiefly those supporting Seyyid Zia, made vigorous and telling attacks on Soviet policy, which the .Tudeh press were unable to answer effectively. Impelled, perhaps^' by this, the Soviet Ambassador suggested to His Majesty’s Ambassador that they should request the Persian Government to oblige the press to moderate its tone. On the 27th January the two ambassadors therefore presented a joint memoran dum to the Persian Government protesting against press attacks on the Allies and requesting the suppression of the worst offenders and the prosecution of their editors. At the same time the Military Governor of Tehran published a notice reminding the press of his powers and threatening to prosecute those responsible for attacks on the Government, or on Government officials, or for upsetting relations with the Allies, or endangering security. The Prime Minister informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that he had sent instructions to all Governors to take similar action in their districts. Subsequently, a number of papers were suppressed for brief periods, but with little effect, as each suppressed newspaper immediately reappeared under another name. 47. As the oil crisis developed there was a marked deterioration in the attitude of the Freedom Front papers towards Great Britain. The disinterested ness of the Soviet Union was asserted in contra-distinction to the machiavellian policy of British Imperialism. The columns in this section of the press were full of virulent attacks on “ Imperialism ” and “ international reaction ” and the agents of these forces, in particular Seyyid Zia, and anti-British innuendoes. The opportunity to attack British policy offered by events in Greece was, more over, not missed by the Freedom Front papers. The Freedom Front press continued its attack on Dr. Millspaugh. Criticism of the Government persisted in all sections of the press. The Tudeh organ, Rahbar, began to advocate during the period under review the formation of a Government based on a coalition of all progressive parties. The Independence Front papers emphasised the need for reform. The Yalta Conference was fully reported; surprise was expressed in the press and public that there was no mention of Persia in the communique issued after the conference. A certain amount of pique was shown at the declara tion of war by Egypt and Turkey and fear lest, by their last-minute declaration, these countries should obtain a position at the peace conference equal to Persia. The approach of the San Francisco Conference has been the occasion for a spate of articles on Persia’s alleged sacrifices to further an Allied victory and the importance of her role in the war. In some minor papers there has been a tendency to recommence attacks on the Shah for alleged unconstitutional interference in political affairs. Other topics discussed by the press include Arab federation, the progress towards the formation of which is regarded as a British diplomatic success. There have been demands by Independence Front papers for the evacua tion of the country by Allied troops, on the grounds that the Dardanelles are now open to Allied shipping. The Freedom Front papers carefully refrained from such demands, which were clearly not in the Soviet interest. 48. There has been a relative improvement in Anglo-Persian relations during the period under review. This was largely due to the acceptance by the British Government of the Persian Government’s decision to defer the grant of concessions until after the war, and the fact that this attitude contrasted favourably with the Soviet attitude. American Affairs. 49. On the 19th February the United States Senate confirmed the appoint ment of Mr. Wallace Murray as ambassador to Persia, in replacement of Mr. Leland Morris, who has been here only since last August. 50. Mr. Morris has been a disappointment. Although not mischievous like his predecessor, Mr. Dreyfus, but on the contrary, frank and honest, he has been inert and has carried no influence whatever. In particular, he was unable to co-ordinate the activities of the American advisers or to curb the intransigence and obstinacy of Dr. Millspaugh. 51. As is known, Mr. Murray has hitherto been very mistrustful of British aims and activities in the Middle East. If, however, the change of heart operated in him by Soviet machinations in this area is serious (see paragraph 34 of my despatch under reference), we may profit by having his strong personality here instead of the mediocrity of his two predecessors.9 Declaration of War on Jafan. 52. On the 28th February, Persia set the seal on Japan’s fate by declaring war on her. Indian Affairs. ^ 53. By the end of March the Indo-Iranian Cultural Society succeeded in overcoming the inertia of and other obstacles presented by the Persian Ministi les of Education and Agriculture and selected (1) four Persian graduates tor the Government of India’s scholarships for the three-year course at the Lyallpur Agricultural College in the Punjab, (2) two for the two years Forest Rangers course at the Imperial Forestry College at Dehra Dun, and (3) five for the Delhi Polytechnic courses in textile and ordinary engineering. The offer of six scholar ships at the Aitchison College, Lahore, had to be rejected a,s it was found that no Persian youth had sufficient knowledge of English to join the college betore reaching the age of 16 or 17 and the college course is planned to take boys from 8 to 17. The difficult problem of getting, the young men to Zahidan was unexpectedly solved by the welcome offer of accommodation in an Indian army motor convoy which happened to be crossing Persia from Iraq at the beginning f ril 54 In March the Society was “ At Home ” and lectures on “ The Philology of Persian, Sanskrit and Russian Works ” and “ The Effect of Persian Literature in India ’ ’ were given by Pandit Rahul Sankrityayana (Professor of Sanskrit at the Moscow University) and M. Bahar (the Persian Poet-Laureate) respectively. At this gathering some excellent films produced by “ Information Films of India were shown and much appreciated. 55. The English classes at Meshed, Kerman and Yezd had teeth mg-troubles caused partly by the Indian teachers’ lack of knowledge of colloquial Persian and partly by incompatibility of temperament, but also by the exceptionally cold winter which kept students away from these classes. An Indian teacher is now on his way to Ahwaz. , r TT ^ , 56. The Indian Trade Commissioner elect (Major M. Hassan) was detained in India by ill-health but is expected in May. 57. The Indian Troops’ Welfare Association continued to entertain the Indian troops of the small garrison in Tehran. The coming spring and summer will enable the association to co-operate with the Army Welfare Services in the organisation of excursions to beauty spots in the mountains near Tehran. British Propaganda Activities. 58. No new activities have been commenced during the three months under review. Our publications continue to circulate with varying degrees of popularity; the Daily News sales have declined slightly—probably because of the decrease in the numbers of British and American troops in Persia; the Children's Newspaper is as popular as ever; the Women's Magazine is not doing as well as we should like; while Ta/sir, the highbrow weekly, is being distributed as in the past to Persian notabilities and newspapers. 59. With the possible cessation of the German war, British propaganda activities are being directed firstly towards emphasising the Japanese war and secondly towards stressing the importance of British trade. 60. On the 21st March a large party was held at Victory House to mark the closing down of the “ Voice of Britain ” on the Tehran Radio. British Council. 61. The number of pupils taught by the British Council went up during the quarter from 4,000 to 4,500, the increases being registered in all three Anglo- Persian institutes operating in Persia (Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz). The usual cultural activities continued during the period under review, the high lights being the first performances in Persia of plays by Shaw (“ Candida’ ) and Priestley ( iC The Long Mirror ”). The concerts of the Tehran Symphony Orchestra (which are sponsored by the Council) continued to be packed to capacity. 62. A notable visitor was the actress, Miss Marie Ney, who gave a successful presentation of Shakespeare’s Women before a large and distinguished audience and was honoured by a command performance before the Persian Court. Tribal Affairs. 63. During the first quarter of 1945 the tribes have, on the whole, remained quiet and have given no trouble. The Persian Government, while doing nothing [66—57! -10 to improve the condition of the tribes, has also refrained from annoying them by ill-timed military ventures. 64. Fars. —The continued presence of the Qavam ul Mulk in Shiraz and his opposition to the Tudeh party has kept alive the attacks in the Soviet-inspired press against the tribal bloc and the danger to the Central Government which is implied therein, and also against the sinister designs of British imperialism in the south. Nasir Khan Qashgai made some efforts to increase his influence in Kuh-i-galu but met with little success. There is some prospect of his coming to Tehran to see the Shah and thus put an end to his equivocal position. 65. Kuh-i-galu. —-The long-drawn-out quarrel between Abdullah Khan Zarghampur and his half-brother, as also the lawless activities of Abdullah himself, seem, temporarily, at least, to have been settled by his making his formal submission to government. The Persian Government has not given him a formal pardon, but some sort of assurance that his past sins would be overlooked. 66. Khuzistan. —General Humayuni has completed his disarmament operations against the Arabs. A high estimate puts the number of rifles collected at 5,000. Most of the rifles handed in were obsolete patterns and some of great antiquity. Complaints have been made by the tribes that they have been placed in a dangerous situation vis-a-vis their Iraqi neighbours and other Persian tribes who have retained their arms. Such complaints will persist until the Persian Government can, as in Raza Shah’s days, guarantee them from attack by their neighbours. The Persian Government is also placed in a difficult position in that it has not the requisite force at its command to tackle the problem in the right sequence, by disarming the more powerful tribes first, but must start on the weaker tribes. 67. Bakhtiari .—-Murteza Quli Khan continues to preserve order though naturally incurring the odium of the other branch of his tribe who see the plums of office going to his relatives and their influence waning. The proposed operations against the Bahmai and Tayyebi tribes were postponed. Murteza Quli Khan had asked, in return for the provision of tribal infantry and cavalry, more than the Government were prepared to give or could afford to give. General Humayuni also advised against the operations on account of the lateness of the season and the impending upward migration of the tribes to areas inaccessible to his troops. 68. The murderers of Mr. Vice-Consul Harris and Dr. Griffiths (who were killed in the Bakhtiari country in 1942) still remain at large, and the Persian Government has taken no steps to effect their capture. 69. Kurdistan. —The tribes of Southern Kurdistan have remained quiet. The fifteen Rogzadeh Jaf tribesmen have been set free at last and have returned to Iraq. No acts of brigandage have occurred to constitute a serious menace to the lines of communication of His Majesty’s forces. In Northern Kurdistan the situation is not so satisfactory. The extent to which Soviet influence has dominated the Kurds, the degree of adherence of the Kurds to Tudeh politics and the distance to which Kurds would be prepared to go in active support of separationist movement in Azerbaijan are not accurately known, and are probably exaggerated by the wealthy burgesses of Tabriz who fear for their skins when the Russians depart. A skirmish took place at Rezaieh, in which a Persian major was killed, and in an affray at Mahabad five policemen were killed. The General Staff promptly assembled a mixed column from Saqqiz to proceed to Mahabad, but the Soviet commander stopped them at Bukan and turned them back. The question has since been taken up on a diplomatic level but, up to the time of writing, the Russians persist in their refusal to admit this column and maintain that any garrison required at Mahabad should come from Tabriz, be limited to a battalion of infantry and not replaced in Tabriz. Persian Forces. 70. —{a) The Army (including the United States Military Mission ).—During the first quarter of 1945 there have been no changes in the posts of Minister for War or Chief of the General Staff, though Ibrahim Zand has been prevented by ill- health from attendance at the ministry since mid-March. There have been many changes in the senior appointments. A new head of the Military Tribunal and a new Public Prosecutor have been appointed. It is to be hoped that their reputed honesty and energy will enable some of the more flagrant cases of corruption to be dealt with. A new deputy Chief of the General Staff, a new Departmental Director and a new Director of Transport have been appointed. A divisional commander has been deprived of his command and summoned to Tehran to answer charges of corruption. A brigade commander has also been changed for the same alleged reason. While General Arfa’s reforming zeal merits11 ( X ♦ all praise, the purity of his motives is tinged with doubt when it is realised that all the outgoing officers were friends of his predecessor General Razmara, am that all their replacements are his own cronies. The High Military Council which General Razmara allowed to lapse into abeyance is again Though not a body of great weight or authority, it has this use in that it defends the Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff from some of the charges %f favouritism. The Majlis has again been debating the Conscription Law criticising the system of drawing lots to choose the required number of conscnp s from the annual call up, and also demanding that the period of compulsory service should be reduced from two years to one. This latter amendment was rejected. In the budget proposed for 1324 (21st March, 1945 to 20th March, 1946), the army has been allotted 1,000,000,000 rials; conscription has^ been shown as 1 400 000 rials and 96,000,000 rials has been allotted for purchases ot military equipment in the United States. These three items amount to approximatelv 25 per cent, of the total budgeted expenditure. When 398,246.100 rials are added for the gendarmerie vote and 237,000,000 rials for the police vote, there is some justification for the statements by Majlis Deputies that Persia is spending more than she can afford on her security and defence forces. The Persian armv has undertaken no operations of any importance during the past three months. Briel references to military activity are given m the section dealing with tribal affairs. The United States Government informed the Persian Government some time ago that General Ridley’s mission would be withdrawn on the 1st March when the period of their contracts expired. The Persian Government then requested the United States Government that the mission should remain for some time longer. The United States Government have cancelled their orders for the recall ot the mission, but nothing has been settled as to the period for which they will remain 71 The Gendarmerie {including the United States Gendarmem Mission) .—-There is little to report and such progress in efficiency and turnout as has been noticed in the capital is offset by the frequent reports of inefficiency, corruption and even connivance at highway robberies which have been received from consular sources in the provinces. Colonel Schwarzkopf still keeps his mission too centralised, and seems to busy himself more with future plans tor organisation than with those frequent tours of inspection which alone can have anv effect on checking corruption and combatting inactivity m a force split up into so many small packets over so wide an area. Two reforms recently intro duced bv him are sound. The first is to have no gendarmerie post of less than one platoon' in strength. The second is to move his Persian gendarmerie officers i round every two years—the minimum period, he estimates, in which a ocal , commander can dig himself in and organise a system of graft on a large scale 72 ,( c ) The Police. —Brigadier Saif remained as Chief of Police during the first three months of 1945. No further steps have been taken to obtain a foreign oolice adviser No progress in organisation, administration or ethciency nave been noted Shortage of personnel and shortage of money are advanced as excuses for every failure and the whole force is rapidly sinking into decay. Persian Air Force. 73 Early in the year the Shah outlined to the Air Attache his idea for a grandiose expansion of the Air Force on very modern lines. His Majesty had little conception of either the cost involved or the long and rigorous training which would be necessary before his goal could even he seen over the horizon No more has been heard of'this project, and the Air Force has on the contrary done less in this quarter than the last, owing partly to natural inertia, partly to internal dissension and partly to inept interference by the General Staff of the Army 74 General Nakhchevan has returned from his mission to the United states brino-ino' it appears, no sheaves with him. He discharges in a desultory fashion the duties of Inspector of the Air Force, an appointment which he does not seem ever formally to have accepted. Civil A ir Lines in Persia. 75 The Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones has taken delivery of the third and last Dominie aircraft bought from His Majesty’s Government. The commercial company which is trying to establish air lines claims that this Ministry has agreed to its proposals, which are stated to be under consideration by other departments, but there are no visible results so far. The End of Dr. Millspaugh. 76 It was stated in the last report that there was a renewed agitation to deprive Dr. Millspaugh of his economic powers, i.e., his functions of purchase, [66—57] c 212 distribution, price control and sale of certain food-stuffs and other goods as distinguished from his financial powers proper. On the 8th January the Majlis passed a Bill depriving him of them, the voting being 69 votes to 6 with 20 absten tions. Although efforts were made in some quarters to persuade him to remain with limited powers, he resigned and left Persia on the 28th February, justifiably disgusted at his treatment hy the Persian Government and its ingratitude for the very considerable services which he had rendered. (For an appreciation of his~ qualities and defects please see paragraph 64 of the Annual Political Review conveyed in my despatch No. 73 of the 9th March, 1945.) Some of his American staff have also resigned, but most of them are remaining, with their powers reduced to that of advisers. (The principal ones are Mr. Pixley and Dr. Black.) They are not, however, of very high calibre or of sufficiently strong personality to influence the Persian Government towards setting its house in order; and unless an adequate successor to Dr. Millspaugh is appointed (which at the present stage appears improbable) the financial situation is likely to become even more serious. Finance. 77. The budgetary out-turn for the first ten months of the current financial year, i.e., up to the 20th January, 1945, has been as follows. (Figures for the same period in the year 1943-44 are given for comparison) :— 1943-U. 19U-45. (Million rials.) Ordinary revenue Ordinary expenditure ... 3,649 3,124 3,183 3,200 * + 525 17 • Commercial revenue Commercial expenditure 1,745 3,193 2,857 3,396 -1,448 • - 539 Net deficit 923 556 The payment of salaries to Government servants is, however, a month in arrear, and about 200 million rials should therefore be added to the deficit on the ordinary budget on this account. 78. It is most improbable that Dr. Millspaugh’s hope of balancing the governmental accounts for 1944-45 will be realised, mainly owing to the passive resistance on the part of the taxpayer to the payment of income tax, the inadequate system of collection and the corruption of the underpaid revenue officials. Receipts from income tax for the first ten months of the year have been less than for the corresponding period in the previous year, when the rates were consider ably lower. In Dr. Millspaugh’s view it was by no means impossible that, after his departure, the Government would abolish the income tax. It is expected that a Bill will shortly be tabled in the Majlis at any rate reducing the rates of tax for the future; and it is hardly likely that any sufficient steps will be taken to collect arrears. In the meantime, the Government has reached its statutory limit of borrowing from the National Bank, and its internal debt stands at 4,800 million rials. 79. The ordinary budget for the year 1945-46 (beginning on the 21st March, 1945) was recently presented to the Majlis, which has not even yet approved the budget for 1944^45. This new budget balances at 4,412 million rials, but only with the help of the transfer of a surplus of 500 million rials from the commercial budget, which has not yet been prepared. This can hardly be more than wishful thinking, as the deficit on the commercial budget was 1,741 million in 1943-44 and has been 539 million in the first ten months of the current financial year. The estimated receipts from income tax for the year 1945-46 are 644 million, compared with the estimate of 885 million for 1944-45, but are still almost certainly too high. 80. Note circulation and bank deposits are still increasing. The former, which was just under 1,000 million in 1939, was 6,640 million in December 1944 and 6,709 million in February 1945. Bank deposits, about 500 million in 1939, were 9,003 million in December 1944, and 9,800 in February 1945. The wholesale price index, which was 497 in December, decreased slightly to 486 in February, while the cost of living index rose from 684 in December to 693 in Februarv.13 81. ^ As anticipated in the last report, sales of gold for the account of His Majesty s Government have been discontinued. For the peripd from the 1st to 15th January, when they ceased sales, amounted to the equivalent of £235,880; and for the whole period during which sales were carried out, viz., from the 26th June, 1943, to the 15th January, 1945, to £6-8 million. Economic Situation. 82. 1 he economic powers previously held by Dr. Millspaugh were ceded to an Economic Organisation ” of Persians prominent in the economic field. Since its constitution this body has shown few signs of being able to stem the chaos into which the economic administration of the country has been sliding since American control ceased. The Bayat Government tabled numerous Bills designed to improve agricultural and economic conditions, but most of them are still in the committee stage. They included a new Labour Bill. The practical value of this mass of legislation is doubtful, as the means and the will to enforce them are lacking. 83. Another factor responsible for an important change, at any rate super ficially, in the economic outlook is the removal of Middle East Supply Centre control over a large number of imported commodities. This resulted in great activity by merchants, who are trying to import goods by all means within their power, both honest and dishonest. The goods (Group “ C commodities), which are no longer under Middle East Supply Centre control, still officially require a Persian Government import licence. Merchants are, however, endeavouring to get goods shipped without licences in the hope that they will be able to clear them through the customs on arrival. This attempted evasion of the import licensing regulations is the result of the increased difficulties encountered in obtaining licences, for which larger sums have now to bo paid in bribes to the various officials concerned. Nevertheless, the relaxation of Middle East Supply Centre control has been very welcome both to importers and to exporters as a first step towards freer trade after the war. 84. With the approaching end of hostilities a number of public works schemes are being planned by private companies and administrative bodies. In addition to the Lar irrigation and hydro-electric project previously reported, negotiations are taking place for similar works in Isfahan and Shiraz. Power station equipment is required for an extension to the Tehran power station and for a new generating station in Isfahan. A piped water supply and drainage are planned for Tehran and a new water system for Shiraz/and there are proposals to equip Tehran with trolley-buses, a modern street-lighting sytsem and an electric railway to the summer resort of Shemran. 85. Soviet commercial activities steadily increased during the period under review and are being extended also to other Middle East countries, the goods passing in transit through Persia. The principal commodities concerned are silver, silk, cotton yarn and skins. Economic Warfare. 86. Merchants are still anxiously awaiting the conclusion of hostilities in which they see the end of all controls and economic regulations and envisage a free-for-all trade without the restrictions to which they have become accustomed, but which they nevertheless would wish to see removed. In the majority they are not hostile to these restrictions as they realise that they are an essential part of the war effort and would not continue to be enforced unnecessarily. 87. The easing of facilities for the passage of carpets to Switzerland and of lambskins and other commodities to Turkey should bring a certain measure of relief, and already the fact that liberated territories are coming once more into the sphere of economic activity is producing a spate of enquiries as to the modus operandi of correspondence and trade questions. With this liberation are also coming an increasing number of queries about the remittance of monetary aid to persons of nationality other than Persian residing in those countries. Facilities already exist for Persians and monetary grants are made regularly. . 88. During the quarter it was decided by agreement between the countries concerned and London to dispense with the taking of Ultimate Destination declarations as between Syria-Lebanon, Iraq and Persia. 89. No removals from the Statutory List have been made although one recommendation for deletion has gone forward to the responsible authorities in London.14 Cereals and A gricultural Development. 90. The departure of Dr. Millspaugh might have upset the cereals collection system, but it was arranged that the British officers of the cereals collection team should remain at their posts and work as long as it was seen that the newly appointed Persian officials refrained from interfering with or upsetting their carefully prepared plans for the fixing of prices and the collection of the wheat-^ and barley due for harvesting in the summer of 1945. 91. At the end of March the stock of food-grains in the Tehran elevator amounted to 36,000 tons of wheat and 22,000 tons of barley, enough for 221 days for Tehran City, at the current rate of adulteration, which has been increased from 7 per cent, to 10 per cent, of barley, while the total stock held by the Persian Government was 251,241 tons of bread-grains, well distributed throughout the country. ... -n • 92. It is forecasted that the excellent snow and rain this winter will give a surplus of 30,000 ton§ of grain (20,000 tons of wheat and 10,000 tons of barley) from the existing stocks and another 50,000 tons after the harvest. Enquiries are being made of the Soviet Embassy as to whether they need any of it for Russia before it is offered to the Middle East Supply Centre for other areas in which food-grains are deficient. If, however, the threatened locust invasion (see below) takes serious proportions, all this may have to be reconsidered. 93. At long last the Khuzistan Agricultural Society is to be wound up and. a commission is at Hamid iah Farm for this purpose. As might have been expected, the Persian Ministry of Finance seemingly went out of its way to do the wrong thing by hoodwinking their American “ advisers” and by allowing subordinate officials to make this liquidation as awkward as possible. The incorrectness had to be pointed out to the Persian Minister of hinance and a promise extracted that another emissary would be sent to complete the taking-over from Lieutenant-Colonel E. W. C. Noel, C.I.E., D.S.O., who has been technical manager for the past two years and more. T ransport. 94. Following the removal of Dr. Millspaugh’s economic powers and the reversion of executive control to Persians, Mr. Shields, Director of the Road Transport Administration, also resigned. The Persians then tended to leave most of the work in the hands of the British officers lent to the administration to such an extent that the tendency had to be checked. So despite the change this department has, on the whole, continued to work with less confusion than was anticipated, largely because of the strenuous efforts of the British advisers. Tyre stocks are low, but every endeavour is being made to ensure that the few available are being distributed only to essential consumers. It has been decided to convert three-quarters of the lorry chassis imported under the 1944 procurement programme into buses, so that communications between the capital and provincial towns may be improved. 95. The transport of oil, coal and cereals by road and the transport of goods by rail proceeded satisfactorily. Locust Control. 96. It appeared at the beginning of the quarter that the campaign of the Locust Officer for Persia, as far as the desert or migratory locust was concerned, was destined to be superfluous. However, in the early days of March Cairo reported that flights could be expected to invade the Persian coast in the Gulf. Indeed, by the middle of March several swarms in the ovipositing stage made their appearance on the coast, and by the end of the quarter the locusts had infested considerable areas of the coastal belt. 97. The success of the campaigns against the invasion is not yet substantiated, and the position is viewed with considerable concern by the British, Soviet and Persian authorities. The Bandar Abbas area, where a joint Anglo- Persian effort is being made, is heavily infested with ovipositors and widespread areas are reported to be covered with eggs and there is likelihood that these will increase in magnitude. Khorramshahr area is also reported to have received an attack, but the seriousness of the infestation has not been confirmed. 98. The Moroccan or non-migratory locust did not emulate the tardiness of his travelling cousin. By February in the province of Shiraz, in the Fasa Jahrum and Darab districts, 4,000 hectares were covered with eggs. Unfortunately, the Persian authorities in the area were poorly equipped with transport, so the British Locust Officer lent two of his trucks to assist in this campaign, which appeared to be reasonably successful.15 •v f U.N.R.R.A. and the Polish Evacuees. 99.

G^Sid. ^ (No. 21.) . r Tehran, 2Zrd January, 1945. WITH reference to my despatch No. 401 of the I8th October, I have the honour to convey to you herein a report on Persian affairs during the months ox October, November and December, 1944. Internal Politics and the Oil Dispute with the Soviet Union. 2. At the beginning of October Sa id’s Cabinet continued to enjoy tne support of the majority in the Majlis. The three fractions, the Mihan, the Azadi and the Ittahadi Millp which towards the end of August had combined to form a Government majority, still continued to hold together, although there were signs of disintegration in the largest group, the Azadi. I he Majlis was busy discussing a Bill for the Independence of the Judiciary, which was also the subject of many articles in the press. The Government and Millspaugh were studying the problem of unemployment arising out of the dismissal of workmen hitherto employed by the Allies. ' On the 1st October article 12 of the Compulsory Education Bill, pro viding for an increase in teachers’ salaries, for an expansion in the provision of school buildings, and for special courses for workmen, was approved by the Majlis. Steps taken by Sururi, the Minister of the Interior, to remove the worst criminals out of Tehran to prisons in the south were approved in the press and public opinion. Gholam Hussain Ibtehaj, the chief of the municipality, made a good start by dealing successfully with a strike among municipal workers. A slight temporary drop in the cost of living also had a good effect. Efforts to enlist the support of the press for the Government took the form of frequent invitations by Ministers to press representatives to meetings, at which the former explained the activities of their departments. As a result, the Government was free, for a brief period, from the usual violent attacks in the press. 3. These events were, however, soon overshadowed by a Russian demand for an oil concession in North Persia. Kavtaradze, Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs, who had been in Persia for about two weeks, had informed the Shah on the 1st October that the Soviet Government sought permission to explore for oil over almost the whole of North Persia during a period of five years, after which they would indicate the areas they wished to exploit (the exact figures for the exploration area were 216,000 square kilometres and for the concession area a maximum of 150,000 square kilometres). Kavtaradze further informed His Majesty that he had already approached the Persian Government, whom he found slow to move, and intimated that the Russian Government were not satisfied with Soviet-Persian relations and that the future of Russo-Persian economic relations might depend on the Persian reply to the Russian demand. 4. The news that the Russians were seeking an oil concession was given to the public on the 5th October, when the newspaper Ittila’at published an inter view on the subject with Kavtaradze. Much anxiety had for some time been felt by Persians in Tehran at Soviet penetration in North Persia. The news that they now wanted an extensive oil concession caused widespread alarm, and the con troversy it aroused in Persian political circles put other issues into the background for the rest of the year. 5. The Russians immediately began pulling all possible wires to influence Persian opinion and were supported by a section of the press. The Shah, how ever, informed His Majesty’s Ambassador on the 8th October that the Russian demand for oil rights in the north would be refused, and a few days later Sa'id informed Kavtaradze that the Government had decided early in September to postpone until after the war the question of granting oil concessions. This decision was most unwelcome to Kavtaradze. who said that there might be unpleasant consequences, while acceptance would be most advantageous to the Persian Government, who would enjoy, among other things, the support of the Soviet Government at the Peace Conference. There was little doubt, however, [66—58] SfcoJGL 106 WO -Sm Kw'T Q-t2 that the decision represented the will of the Persian people. At a secret session^ of the Majlis only one Deputy, Taimurtash, son of the former Minister of Court, who was elected to the Majlis with Russian help, spoke in favour of the Russian request. Even the Tudeh members, who were for the Russians, at first showed embarrassment, because some weeks earlier, when it was only a question of British or American requests for concessions, they themselves had recommended that no concession be given till after the war. ^ 6. The Persian Government’s decision was followed by a violent campaign^ in the pro-Russian press against Sa’id, whom they accused of being opposed to Russian interests and of adopting a one-sided policy. They argued that the balance in foreign relations upset by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s concession in the south must be restored by giving the Russians a concession in the north. It was even said that, as Russia did not need more oil, her demand was prompted solely by the altruistic desire to help Persia by developing her resources and pro viding employment for her people. Few newspapers had yet dared to come out on the side of the Government in this dispute, but as public opposition to the grant of a concession gradually hardened a number of them plucked up courage and began to oppose the Russian demand, in spite of the fact that the editors of the first three papers to do so were threatened by the Russians. In some quarters, however, it was feared that Sa’id might have to resign in the face of the violent Russian opposition, and Taqizadeh. Persian Ambassador in London, now on a visit to Tehran, was mentioned as a successor. The Shah, indeed, was said to be urging Taqizadeh to accept the premiership, but Taqizadeh, after attending a number of conferences to discuss Persia’s post-war problems, returned to London on the 28th October. 7. On the 19th October Sa’id made a statement in the Majlis explaining and defending the Government’s attitude, and although no vote was taken, there was no doubt that he had the House with him on this issue. The Russians, meanwhile, continued every form of pressure and intensified their war of nerves. They allowed no grain to be moved to Tehran on the Northern Railways. They interrupted telegraphic communication with Tabriz for a few days. On the 22nd October lorry loads of armed Russian troops were seen in the streets and in particular near the Majlis. Deputies were subjected to pressure. Violent attacks on the Prime Minister continued, and in a broadcast from Tehran, which purported to be by the Persian-Soviet Cultural Society, the Soviet Embassy^ broadcast the Soviet point of view in a most violent form. Moscow radio and papers proclaimed that the Persian Government’s decision was not based on public opinion and that the Persian press was in favour of the Russian demand for a concession. Sa’id and his supporters were, of course, described as Fascists. Finally, the story was put alTout that the Russians considered that their relations with Sa’id’s Government were severed. In the circumstances Sa’id was prepared to go, to provide a way out of the deadlock, but the Majlis remained solidly behind him and the Shah was as yet opposed to his resignation. 8. On the 24th October Kavtaradze gave an interview to the Tehran press, in which, after describing in vague terms the advantages to Persia of granting a concession to the Russians, he stated that Sa’id had originally signified complete agreement and promised his help, but that his subsequent refusal had strained relations between Persia and Russia. Sa’id’s reply to this was that in the talks to which Kavtaradze referred only the Khourian oil business had been mentioned. In reply to a question put by one of the journalists as to the conditions offered by the Russians, M. Kavtaradze said that that would be discussed afterwards. He thereby confirmed the statement of M. Sa’id that M. Kavtaradze had insisted on the concession being granted in principle without consideration of any conditions except the areas demanded by the Soviet Government first for exploration and then for development. 9. On the 27th October a demonstration organised by the Tudeh was held in the streets of Tehran. The crowd was accompanied by lorries of armed Russian soldiers. Various Tudeh leaders made speeches demanding the removal of Sa’id and the grant of the concession to the Russians. The effect on public opinion was, however, the reverse of what was intended and merely aroused indignation against the Russians and the Tudeh. By now, too, some six or seven newspapers had come out strongly in favour of the Government, the Bakhtar, in particular, urging the Russians not to be misled by Persian quislings, and pointing out that the Persians did not expect such treatment after they had given all possible assistance to the Allies in their war effort. The Government was also moved to action by these events, and a warning was issued by the Military Governor that the regulation forbidding gatherings of more than three persons in3 [66—58] B 2 the streets would henceforth be enforced. The Prime Minister also issued a state ment to the press giving a complete reply to the statement issued by Kavtaradze on the 24th October. Trouble was now reported from Tabriz, Resht, Isfahan and Sultanabad. In Tabriz the mob tried to rush the police headquarters and was fired on, one man being killed and several wounded. Russian troops intervened and prevented the Persian police and military from interfering with the mob. &lt;&lt; r.The officer commanding the Persian troops was given twenty-four hours to leave the town. At Resht the shops were closed and the Persian police were similarly prevented from dispersing the crowd. In Isfahan and Sultanabad, where there are no Russian troops, the demonstrations were small and soon dispersed without incident. 10. All the efforts of the Russians to incite the press and the Tudeh to agitate in their favour served only to show that public opinion was opposed to the grant of this concession and was being antagonised and disillusioned by the methods adopted by the Russians. An increasing number of newspapers began to support the Government on the oil question. The Russian censors did their best to ensure that only Moscow’s partisan account of the matter should reach the outside world. They not only stopped any press telegrams giving an objective opinion, but suppressed the official Persian version which M. Sa’id tried to tele graph to Persian representatives in London, Washington and elsewhere, first in plain language and then in cypher. In spite of Russian censorship obstruction, however, the Persian Government’s version of the matter eventually reached the newspapers abroad. As a result of the publicity which the dispute had now acquired, Russian propaganda began to shift its ground. Sa’id was attacked, not so much for refusing the concession as for upsetting Russo-Persian relations, and he was accused of trying to establish in Persia a base for Fascist aggression against Russia; and the facts were falsified sc as to appear to justify Russian indignation. 11. Nevertheless, in spite of public support of Sa’id and the Government, a number of deputies began to find the strain intolerable and the opinion in the Majlis was gaining ground that Sa’id should resign, as a sop to the Russians. The various fractions in parliament began to hold meetings to discuss Sa’id’s successor. The majority appeared to favour Dr. Musaddiq, who on the 29th October made a very long speech in the Majlis which created some impression. In this, he went over a lot of old history and criticised the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company concession but finished by advising the Government not to give a con cession to the Russians but to form a Persian or an international company to exploit the Northern oilfields and sell the surplus oil. 12. By the 3rd November there seemed to be a slight detente in the crisis and it was said that the Russians were prepared to drop their demand for a concession. The Russians permitted the transport of grain to Tehran to be resumed on the Northern railways and the Russian censor passed oil crisis tele grams, albeit very discreet ones, addressed to Reuter and American agencies. But pressure on Sa’id to resign was intensified. The campaign against him in the Russian sponsored press increased in violence and on the 6th November Moscow radio broadcast in Persian “ a national protest against the Government of Sa’id,” giving reports of alleged mass meetings throughout Persia against his reactionary Government. The Government also had to take steps to suppress another Tudeh demonstration on the 7th November by sending troops to occupy their premises and by arresting some of their leaders. Sa’id was by now receiving information by indirect means from the Russians that if he resigned they would drop their demand for a concession and Kavtaradze would go. Sa’id therefore on the 8th November invited some twenty deputies representing all sections of the Majlis to a meeting and told them to choose his successor. 13. Finally, on the 10th November Sa’id resigned. The Shah informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that Sa’id’s resignation had been accepted for fear lest the Russians should resort to extreme measures such as instigating a separatist movement in Azerbaijan. For some days after Sa’id’s resignation Majlis dis cussion continued to centre round the nomination of Dr. Musaddiq. On the 14th November the deputies voted almost unanimously for Dr. Musaddiq, but almost equally unanimously against accepting his condition that special legisla tion be passed authorising him to resume his seat in parliament if he had to resign from the premiership at any time before the end of the 14th Majlis. The various Majlis fractions therefore went into conclave again to choose a Prime Minister, and it was not until the 20th November that Mustafa Quli Bavat was elected Prime Minister with fifty votes against forty-five given to Sadiq Sadiqi. Until the last moment the favourite was Sami’i, formerly n diplomat but now4 a Court official, but he withdrew and Bayat was apparently chosen, in spite of&lt; his defects, as an alternative to Sadiq Sadiqi, who had been heard recommending compliance with Russian demands. 14. Bayat presented his Cabinet to the Shah on the 25th November and to the Majlis the next day. Two of the new Ministers, Khalil Fahimi, Minister without Portfolio, and Sururi, Minister of Interior, had occupied the same posts m ba id s Government. With the exception of Nadir Arasteh, the new Minister, of Posts and Telegraphs, all the new men had previously held Cabinet rank. N asm 11 ah Intizam was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs after Muhsin Rais, Persian Ambassador in Bagdad, had refused the post. Kemal Hidayat became Mimster of Commerce; Amanullah Ardalan, Minister of Finance; Dr. Issa badiq, Minister of Education; Ibrahim Zand, Minister of War; Dr. Said Malik Minister of Health; Mustafa Adi, Minister of Justice; and Ali Akbar Siash xiinister without Portfolio. On the whole the new Cabinet was thought to be a fairly good one. ° 15. On the 2nd December a new turn was given to the oil dispute when Di. Musaddiq tabled a bill in the Majlis making it illegal for any Persian Government to give an oil concession to any foreign Government or company but authorising the Prime Minister or Ministers to discuss the sale of oil or the manner in which the Government should undertake the exploitation and adminis tration of its oil resources, and to inform the Majlis. The bill was passed immediately. The Tudeh deputies were completely nonplussed by this new development and asked for time to collect their fraction and discuss the bill but were refused. The next day Rahimian, deputy for Kuchan, tried to bring forward a bill to cancel the Anglo-Iranian oil concession but could find no backers and dropped R. Discussion on the new Government’s programme was concluded on the 4th December and Bayat received a vote of confidence by a majority of seventy-two to nine with sixteen abstentions. .i t!?A ^ Majlis itself the coalition of the three fractions, the Mihan the. Ittanadi Milli and the Azadi, did not survive the crisis which led to Sa’id’s resignation. The Azadi group had disintegrated until by the end of December it contained only seven to eight members. Two new fractions composed of ex- Azadi members and a number of independents were reported to be taking shape during December. These were the Mustaqil group which claimed about seventeen members, and the Democrats, said to number about twelve. The attitude these two new fractions intend to adopt remains to be seen. During the period under review the Majlis passed the credentials of a number of deputies from the North who had been elected with Russian help. The credentials of Mujtahidi, deputv for Tabriz, and of Ovanassian, deputy for the Northern Armenians and a founder member of the I udeh party, were passed on the 15th October. Those of Ipekchian and Lanka rani, both creatures of the Russians, were passed early in December. Lankarani was elected by a particularly shameless exercise of Russian influence The pro-Government majority in the Majlis, which had long obstructed the acceptance of these Russian-sponsored deputies, had finally deemed it unwise, in vle T °f. i t T 1 | ls m Russo-Persian relations, to maintain their opposition the credentials of four other deputies were also passed during this period; those of imad Toulieh, deputy for Rey; of Murad Aryeh, member for the Jews; of Pur Reza, deputy for Firuzabad; and of Muhammad Hussein Qashgai, who had recently been elected deputy for Abadeh. ^ ^ lltlu 17. The Tehran press was divided by the oil crisis into two violentlv antagonistic groups—the Freedom Front and the Independence Front The former, consisting of newspapers which receive money, paper and promises of future help from the Russians, violently attacked Sa’id when he refused the TL C TTl 10n r nd ( f ntmue { i t0 a^ack him after his resignation. They also attacked the ruling classes whom they accused of being the instruments of reaction and imperialism. Seyid Zia, who is a particular object of their hatred was rli 0 . have ^ b / 0U ! ht . ba S k ^ his masters from Palestine to prepare « other coup d Etat. 1 aqizadeh was also said to have returned from London nH h f 8 ?!? 10 Smi !i ter ® cheme . m connection with the oil question. Towards the end of the period under review some of the Freedom Front papers were comparing conditions in Persia to conditions in Greece and Belgium and were alleging that a fight was going on all over the world between the proletariat and the mling classes Meanwhile, however, the number of papers which opposed the Russian demand for a concession had increased until in December they formed an Independence Front in opposition to the Freedom Front. Ra’d Imruz one of le principal papers of the Independence Front, published on the 21st December a very outspoken declaration on the crisis by Seyid Zia, containing a reasonedA 5 -^criticism of Russian policy and methods in Persia which caused a great impression and sent Seyid Zia’s stock up considerably. 18. Kavtaradze left Tehran for Moscow on the 9th December but he had previously informed the Prime Minister of the Soviet Government’s displeasure at the Oil Bill which, he said, the Majlis would do well to reconsider. Meanwhile Russian propaganda was intensified among all classes and even in the schools. There were further Tudeh demonstrations in Maragheh, Shahpur and Tabriz and trouble in a factory in Shahi where some workmen were reported to have been killed. I he year ended in an atmosphere of growing uneasiness and uncertainty as regards Russian intentions in North Persia where they had already begun to exercise a considerable measure of direct political control 1 . Soviet Affairs. 19. In connexion with the oil dispute, this embassy suggested to the Foreign Office that discussions should be held as to the possibility of withdrawing British forces at least from Tehran as soon as war material and goods despatched to the Soviet Union from overseas were diverted to some other route in Persia. There were many complications, e.g., the arrangement to send a large quantity of aviation spirit from Abadan to the Soviet Union until the middle of 1945;' the fact that the presence of Royal Air Force personnel in Tehran enabled the British authorities concerned to maintain their connexion with the Persian Air Force &amp;nd aircraft factory, and to supply the necessary technical services for the British Airways line to Tehran. On the other hand, withdrawal offered several advantages : (1) if the British evacuated Tehran, the Soviet authorities must either do the same or expose themselves as less considerate than the British. (2) the evacuation of Tehran by the foreign troops would in itself strengthen the Persian Government. (3) if the touchiness of the Soviet authorities was due m part to the suspicion of British motives (as it probably was) an offer on our part to evacuate Tehran, and perhaps other places, might'help to calm them down, even if at first they did attribute the offer to a wish to remove Soviet influence from the capital. His Majesty’s Embassy pointed out in addition that in a number of cases actions which seemed innocent enough to the doers aroused profound suspicion in the Soviet mind, e.g., attempts made by British parties during the fiist year of occupation to enter the Soviet “ zone ” to make surveys or reconnaissances. Moreover, the defenders of the Soviet Government’s demand foi an oil concession represented it as prompted by the manoeuvre of capitalist concession hunters in Persia. However mistaken, and even dishonest Soviet accusations m such matters might be, His Majesty’s Government should consider seriously all possible causes of suspicion with a view to their elimination or diminution wherever possible. (Possible innocent causes of Soviet suspicion are the continued maintenance by the British authorities of the 300 mile road from Zahidan to Kerman and the 600 mile road from Zahidan to Meshed, and the completion of the Kerman aerodrome, although aid to Russia by the East Persia route has ceased and the danger of a German attack from the Caucasus has passed.) A nglo-Soviet-Persian Censorship. r Uv 2 ?; dlffi( : ulti 1 es with the Soviet authorities over the political censorship ot books and periodicals continued and, indeed, increased during the period under review. In spite of reminders the Soviet Ambassador did not reply to the protest sent b\ Mr. Lascelles on the subject in September, and the Soviet censor extended his activities against British publications. Previously he had been opening paicels addressed to the British Council and to booksellers, c/o the Public Relations Buieau, British Embassy. Early in December, however the Soviet censor complained that the Public Relations Bureau were selling at their premises copies of publications condemned by him. He therefore gave notice that he would examine all parcels addressed to the Public Relations Bureau direct This embassy thereupon requested the British censor to inform his Soviet colleague that the publications in question would be withdrawn, but at the same time^ to protest against the examining of parcels addressed to the Public Relations Bureau, which was an integral part of the embassy and covered by diplomatic privilege The Soviet censor, however, refused to abstain, so this embassy requested the British censor to express regret to his Soviet colleague that so lono- as the latter continued this practice, the British censor would examine all parcels ad fhe Soviet Trade Delegation (who are the main channel through which Russian publications are put on the Persian market and for whom the Soviet authorities claim diplomatic privilege). At the same time the British6 censor was to reiterate the suggestion that both parties should cease to conduct^ political censorship. 21. The question now arises whether the British organisations concerned should or should not put on the Persian market copies of publications condemned by the Soviet censor, which reach them by channels not liable to censorship (e.g., by diplomatic bag). This embassy expressed the view to the Foreign Office that the Public Relations Bureau should not sell such publications in their own^ shops, but it seemed a pity to forbid their distribution to private booksellers, as the Soviet censor had by now condemned a wide range of publications, mostly on preposterous grounds, and many of them standard works. The instructions of His Majesty’s Government on this point are awaited. 22. The American Embassy in turn are now worried at the large proportion of American newspapers and periodicals which fail to reach American subscribers in Persia, and they unofficially informed this embassy that they were thinking of reporting to their Government that this was presumably due to the Soviet censor. This embassy replied that they understood the anxiety of the American Embassy, and that, for reasons of their own, they would not regret it if the matter was brought to the attention of the United States Government. 23. The Soviet censor has slashed unmercifully the material submitted by the Polish Legation for broadcasting in the time allotted to them by Tehran Radio, so much so that often their programme had to be confined to gramophone records. To restore the balance, the British censor was requested by this embassy to cut objectionable material from the material submitted for broadcasting by the Soviet- sponsored Polish Patriots. The Soviet authorities countered this by broadcasting the whole of the Polish Patriots’ material without submitting it for censorship, prefacing the broadcast with an announcement that it was given under the auspices of the Soviet Embassy (and consequently not liable to censorship). Security. 24. There are signs that the Soviet authorities are planning to use as agents some of the Persians interned for activities directed against the Allies. 25. The Persian internees are divided into those who are mainly a British and those who are mainly a Soviet concern. The British authorities allowed the Soviet authorities to take to Resht for interrogation two Persians on the British list; the Mullah Kashani, who is perhaps the most important and most dangerous of the Sultanabad internees, and Naubakht, who also played an important part in the plot against the Allies. It was noted with surprise that the Soviet officers who returned them to the British security authorities treated them with the greatest consideration, shaking hands with them and parting with them on the most friendly terms. Kashani expresses the greatest detestation of the British and says openly that when he is released he will do us all the harm he can. He would make an ideal Soviet agent. 26. Neither side releases any internee without the concurrence of the other. The Soviet Embassy recently sent to this embassy their first list of internees whom they proposed to release. Among the names was that of General Aghevli, who at the time of his arrest was commanding the gendarmerie. For some time the Soviet security officers had been trying, without success, to persuade the British security officers that Aghevli had not taken any serious part in anti-Ally activities. The attitude of the British security officers was that both written and oral evidence showed conclusively that Aghevli held a key position in the plot, and this, combined with his intelligence and his official position, made him a most dangerous enemy of the Allies. This embassy therefore felt bound to refuse his release, giving the above reasons, and adding that, if his name had not been on the Soviet list, we should have put him on ours. There is no doubt that the Soviets expect assistance from Aghevli if he is released, in return for their unexpected and undeserved leniency. 27. A number of the less important Persians on the British list of suspects have been released, with Soviet consent, during the period under review. Piqued, however, by our refusal to release General Aghevli, the Soviet Embassy refused to allow this embassy to release four unimportant suspects, alleging that they were highly dangerous. This embassy replied that, in view of the Soviet Embassy’s objections, these men would not be released, but took the opportunity of pointing out that it would not have submitted their names to the Soviet Embassy if the British security authorities had not previously ascertained from the Soviet security authorities that there was no objection from' the Soviet side to their release; it was unfortunate that the Soviet security authorities had failed, apparently, to keep their embassy fully informed in this matter.7 ^“^4^ to Russia.” 28. The assembly of United States aeroplanes for the Soviet Union at Abadan ceased at the end of November. The assembly of British aeroplanes continued at Shaiba but on a very reduced scale. 29. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and the United States Army Motor Transport Service ceased lifting “Aid to Russia' cargo during ^ .the period under review. The United States trucks are being transferred to other war theatres. Transport of freight through Persia for “ Aid to Russia is now confined to the railway, except for such freight as can be carried in trucks assembled in the south for the Soviet army. ^ 30. On the 15th December, 1944, the United States truck assembly plant for imported cased motor transport was closed down and the plant and equipment was dismantled and is now en route to the Soviet Union for re-erection in a Black Sea port, preparatory to the opening up of direct shipping from the United States to Black Sea ports.' The only truck assembly plant now working is the United States plant at Khorramshahr, and the output from this has been raised to 5,000 imported trucks per month. There are enough cased motor transport on hand and en route to keep output at this rate until the end of April, when this plant will be available for transfer elsewhere. With effect from the 1st January the British Army vehicle assembly plant at Rafidiya will no longer be required to assemble cased motor transport for the Soviet Union. 31. From the 1st January, 1945, the port of Bandar Shapur will not be utilised for discharging “Aid to Russia’’ cargoes as the number of ships is now so limited that Khorramshahr can easily handle and despatch all “ Aid to Russia ” cargo now arriving. February 1945 is the latest month in which United States “Aid to Russia” ships will arrive in the Persian Gulf. They will thereafter proceed to Black Sea ports. It would appear that from the 1st March, 1945, the only ships entering the Persian Gulf with “Aid to Russia ” cargoes will be occasional ships from India and Ceylon. 32. A considerable number of United States motor truck and port operational personnel are now being despatched to other theatres of operation. 33. The supply of motor spirit to the Soviet Union from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company refineries at Abadan ceased in November, but the supply of aviation spirit will continue till the end of June 1945. American Interests. 34. In the course of their talks with the State Department regarding the Soviet oil crisis, His Majesty’s Embassy in Washington reported that Mr. Wallace Murray, who deals with Middle East affairs in the department, was constantly preoccupied with the fear of Soviet penetration in the Balkans and the Middle East, and his views about the Soviet Union were increasing his desire to co-operate with the British on every issue and in particular to consult with the British in advance on all matters and to concert action. 34a. At the end of December Brigadier-General Booth took over from Lieutenant-General Conolly the command of the American Persian Gulf Command. American Advisory Mission. (a) Millspaugh Mission. 35. The oil crisis very much overshadowed the Millspaugh crisis during the period under review and there were fewer attacks upon Dr. Millspaugh. This was also partly due to the improvement in the economic situation. Much of this progress was due to the course of the war, though Dr. Millspaugh claimed the credit in an open letter which he sent to the Prime Minister early in October. In this letter he stated that everything possible had been done to secure adequate quotas for imports, that prices were falling, that monopoly goods were being distributed, that road transport had improved, that a large stock of grain was in hand and that revenue had increased. He added, however, that as the special powers in economic matters conferred on him by the Majlis were held by some to conflict with the Constitution, he intended in future to act in economic as in financial matters, i.e., under the supervision of the Minister of Finance. 36. Dr. Millspaugh, however, spoilt whatever effect this letter might have had by sending at the same time a letter M. Ibtihaj. the Governor of the National Bank* dismissing him from his office. M. Ibtihaj, a clever but very arrogant and8 bad tempered man, had for some time been attacking Dr. Millspaugh, whon^ with the assistance of M. Sa’id and of the Shah, he tried to unseat during a visit to the United States as Persian delegate to the Bretton Woods Conference. The Persian Cabinet decided that Dr. Millspaugh had no power to dismiss Dr. Ibtihaj, and Dr. Millspaugh countered by writing to all the banks informing them that Dr. Ibtihaj’s signature should not be recognised. This violent action had no effect; M. Ibtihaj remains in his post and the affair has so far constituted a defea|fc for Dr. Millspaugh. 37. In December the new Prime Minister found himself under strong pressure from his supporters among the Deputies to get rid of Dr. Millspaugh or to rescind his special powers. After negotiations between the Prime Minister and Dr. Millspaugh a Bill was presented to the Majlis revoking the exceptional powers under which he administered economic affairs; he would, however, still retain his original powers in financial matters. This Bill had not been passed by the end of the year as the Deputies were unable to reach a decision as to who should inherit the economic powers. 38. Although the Prime Minister would be glad to get rid of Dr. Millspaugh altogether, he appears anxious to keep the rest of the Millspaugh Mission, and His Majesty’s Government have instructed this embassy to do everything possible to secure their retention. Meanwhile that stubborn old gentleman seems to have given up any idea he had of resigning in February. (b) Military Mission. 39. General Ridley has gone to America. From confidential sources it is known that he is to discuss the future of the American Military Mission, whose contracts expire this spring, and to arrange for the shipment of equipment for the Persian army. There is a general lack of enthusiasm among the officers of his mission, a feeling that there is little that they can achieve. They have, in fact, improved the supply and transport arrangements of the Persian Army, but their control ceases as soon as issues leave the depots. Even so, a greater proportion does perhaps reach the man in the ranks than reached him two years ago. (c) Gendarmerie Mission. 40. The State Department succeeded in persuading the War Department in Washington of the importance of helping the Persian Government to improve their police. They did not, however, feel justified in proposing the matter to the Persian Government; the latter, either of their own accord or at British prompting, must make a definite request that Colonel Schwartzkopf should take over the police as well as the gendarmerie, and that additional American officers should be engaged to train the former. His Majesty’s Government instructed this embassy to impress on the Persian Government the importance of acting quickly in the matter. Approaches to the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior have, however, produced no result so far. It may be that the known hostility of the Russians in the presence of American advisers in Persia makes the police unwilling to add to the number of such advisers when Persia is already - being accused by Russia and the pro-Russian Persian press of following a “ one sided ’ ’ policy. Anglo-Persian Public Relations. 41. The British and American attitude in readily accepting the Persian Government’s decision to postpone consideration of the granting of oil concessions until after the war has reflected to our credit by comparison with the aggressive reaction of the Russians. The increased fear of Russian post-war designs on Persia caused by this has not been balanced by any great reliance upon Britain’s ability to restrain them. It has rather resulted in a general desire to be rid of all foreign interference in and control over local affairs. The decrease in the activities of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation has not attracted much attention, and public opinion looks forward to the end of the war for a more general relaxation of all foreign control such as that exercised by the Middle East Supply Centre over local imports. 42. The Persian press has continued to report favourably upon Allied successes and, in spite of being very much occupied with reporting local problems, has devoted just as much space as formerly to the w^ar. The Greek situation has been much commented upon from both points of view.9 i O British Propaganda A ctimties. 43. A slight increase in the sales of the Tehran Daily News, published by the Public Relations Bureau, was noted during the last three months. The continued and growing success of the Children's Newspaper, published in Persian, has aroused a certain amount of comment in the Persian press probably caused by a feeling of envy that their own publications have not achieved the same 2 measure of popularity amongst their own people. 44. The showing of Ministry of Information newsreels in public cinemas throughout Persia has suffered on account of the strike of the Tehran cinemas which have remained closed for some six or seven weeks as a protest against new municipal taxes. The Films Section of the Public Relations Bureau is, however, more active than ever, operating seven touring cinema vans and nine portable 16-mm. projectors in British Council Institutes and local colleges and schools in addition to its own Tehran Newsreel Theatre where free educational programmes are shown to school-children twice every morning during term- time. There is a constantly growing demand for film shows from all varieties and classes of Persian associations. British feature films have hitherto been conspicuous by their absence from Persian cinemas, and it is good to report that in December the first important sale of British films was completed by the Public Relations Bureau with contracts placed for twenty-four films. 45. His Majesty’s consulates continue to be fed with publicity material for distribution although this is hampered by the arbitrary holding-up of apparently innocuous material by the Russian censors. It is remarked that there are increasing requests for new reading rooms in the provinces. The Irano-Soviet Cultural Society is trying to increase its influence in the provinces by methods which are not alw T ays popular. 46. This embassy has had under review the question of broadcasting in foreign languages from Tehran Radio. This embassy and various other Allied Missions in Tehran each have short periods allotted to them every week for propaganda broadcasts. It was in any case clear that this was one of the first propaganda activities which this embassy would have to close down when things began to return to normal in Persia; certain other Allied Missions, such as the Netherlands Legation and the French delegation were already losing interest in their own broadcasts; the Polish Legation broadcasts were becoming less and less necessary as the number of Polish evacuees diminished; finally (as reported in an earlier section) these foreign propaganda broadcasts had led to an undesirable censorship squabble between this embassy, defending the interests of the Polish Legation, and the Soviet Embassy, defending those of the Polish Patriots. This embassy therefore recommended' to the Ministry of Information that they should take the lead in giving up these broadcasts, and it has been decided to withdraw on the 21st March, the Persian New Year’s day. Indian Affairs. 47. In October an Indo-Iranian Cultural Society was formed in Tehran and was given its official baptism on the 17th at a public meeting which was attended by the Persian Prime Minister and His Majesty’s representative and leading Persian educationalists. By the 4th December the statutes and rules of the society were finally approved and published, and a Managing Committee of fourteen chosen, i.e. :— (1) Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. (2) Persian Minister for Education. (3) The Chancellor of the Tehran University. (4) The head of the Persian College of Arts. (5) The representative of the British Council in Persia. (6) One representative of the British Embassy (the Government of India counsellor). (7) The attache for Indian affairs. (8) The Indian Trade Commissioner; and (9) Six prominent savants of Persia approved by the Minister of Education. The society meets weekly and is at present busy trying to find Persian lads capable of taking up the seventeen scholarships generously offered by the Govern ment of India, viz. : (1) Six at the Aitchison College, Lahore; (2) four at the Agricultural College at Lyallpur; (3) two at the Forest Rangers course in Dehra [66—58] c10 Dun; and (4) five at the Delhi Polytechnic (three in engineering and two in ^ textiles). The work drags partly because it is essential that no student should be sent to India unless his knowledge of English is really sufficient to enable him to follow the course, and partly because there is much anti-Indian preiudice to be overcome. 48. The four Indian teachers of English have just reached Meshed (2), Iverman and Yezd, and are already finding a great demand for their services in • 1 ersian schools, and also in private classes and for individual tuition. On the success of these four teachers depends the question of obtaining more Indian trained teachers of English to supplement the excellent work being done by the British Council. 49. Major Hassan of the Indian Army has been selected to be the first Indian Irade Commissioner to Persia and is undergoing a course of trainino 1 in India before taking over his post in January or February. Suitable offices for him have been rented in as central a position as possible. 50. The British Indian Community in Tehran having represented that they would like to entertain Indian troops stationed there, a combined military and civil Indian Troops Welfare Association was formed in October with the object that every week some fifty Indian officers and other ranks should be entertained by members in turn either in their own houses or in the Indian Young Men’s Christian Association building. These parties are purposely kept small in order that the personal aspect should be maintained and have been a great success. A Fund is contemplated in order to cover large-scale entertainment on certain Indian religious festivals and holidays. 51. The Government of India continue to interest themselves in post-war propaganda in Persia as is shown by their generous offer of seventeen scholar ships varying from two to six years in technical, agricultural, forestry and educa tion colleges in India, and also by the appointment of an Indian Trade Commis- * sioner at Tehran. Enquiries are also being made whether an Indian film company could operate in Persia. British Military Interests. 52. Thanks partly to better co-operation from the Persian authorities, there has been a reduction in the stealing of telephone wire which has been the cause of great inconvenience to the Allied military authorities. It still continues, as does the pilfering on a considerable scale of Allied military stores, but an improve ment may result from the application of military government law to offences com mitted on the railway and on roads used by Allied troops. This will allow of the more speedy trial of offenders and the award of more severe sentences than are permissible under the ordinary law. Persian Forces. 53. The Army .—rThe army remains handicapped by shortage of funds; the current year’s budget not yet having been passed by the Majlis, it lives from hand to mouth on monthly credits on the scale of l/12th of the previous year’s budget. An additional credit of 15 million tomans, particularly for the purpose of increasing the pay of officers, was sanctioned by the Majlis in October but Dr. Millspaugh has not yet made the funds available. In spite of this, morale of the lower ranks has slightly improved; the troops are generally a little better fed, a little less ragged; the condition of animals in Tehran has markedly improved and there is now sufficient transport for the distribution of supplies and clothing. Certain operations, to which further reference is made later, have met with a success which has done something to restore the army’s confidence in itself. But political intrigues, personal ambitions, dissensions among officers, favouritism, and the always existing uncertainty that arises from the ambiguous positions of the Shah and the Ministry of War in relation to the army, all combine to prevent the consistent execution of a practical policy to reform. Tudeh party propaganda has recently been directed towards junior officers and non-commis sioned officers urging them not to allow themselves to be used as tools of the reactionaries, particularly in the suppression of the legitimate aspirations of their oppressed brothers, inciting them against the exploitation of their corrupt seniors and encouraging them to become politically educated and politically minded. As this propaganda is generally believed to be inspired by the Soviet Authorities, it is not without effect on those who expect that Soviet favour may affect their prospects. 54. Ibrahim Zand was re-appointed Minister for War after an interval of three months and almost immediately came into conflict with the vigorous personality of General Razmara, the Chief of the Staff. The latter had offended11 [66—58] » the Shah by some rather arbitrary actions, lost some favour with the Soviet authorities who considered him to blame for repressive action taken by the Military Governor against Tudeh demonstrations and antagonised a number of the Deputies by his successful and selfish exploitation of various sources of income, by his wide spread intrigues and by his boundless personal ambition. He was dismissed on the ^ 21st December, but he will be heard of again. He is about the ablest and most energetic officer in the Persian army, but quite unprincipled. There is reason to believe that the Soviet authorities are annoyed at his dismissal, the indications of their displeasure having been intended only to bring him to heel. He has been succeeded by General Hassan Arfa, who has some ability, but is little respected in the army and has faults of character that make his success doubtful. His mother was Russian; he himself has a very lively fear of Soviet designs, and, although inclined to be xenophobe, he is not, at present, unfriendly to us. A ir Force. 55. Sarlashkar Ahmad Nakhchevan, at that time commanding the Persian Air Force, left Tehran on the 28th October, 1944, accompanied by Colonel Bayendor, Persian air attache in London, for a visit to England. General Nakhchevan returned on the 12th December, 1944. greatly impressed by what he had seen in England and by the courtesy and hospitality he had experienced. During his absence his enemies had succeeded in getting him replaced in the command of the air force, by Bar tip Ahmad Khosrovani, an air force officer, who had, however, no connexion with the air force for about three years. General Nakhchevan was offered the new post of Inspector of the Air Force, but declined it. On the 27th December, 1944, accompanied by Colonel Siah Poosh, an English- speaking technical officer of the Persian air force, he left for America in the aircraft that took General Connolly of the United States Persian Gulf Command back to the States. This visit,'according to General Nakhchevan, had been pro visionally arranged while he was in London, as an antidote to that of Colonel Khosrovani, brother of the General, who had been sent to attend the Chicago Conference on civil aviation and is still in America. Civil A ir Lines. 56. Two of the three Dominies ordered by the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones were delivered in October 1944, and are now operating on the Tehran-Bagdad route. The third force landed on its way to Tehran and was taken back to Habbaniyah for repairs, where it still is. 57. The group who are seeking to establish a commercial air line have formed their company and are about to approach the Majlis for the necessary authority to operate. G. H. Ebtehaj is managing director and the board includes some good names. They seem anxious to work closely with British Overseas Airways Corporation, and this attitude shows signs of provoking the usual Russian reaction. Meanwhile the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones declare they will not relinquish their own services to anyone. They too are anxious for British help, so they say. Tribal Situation. 58. The tribal situation has on the whole remained remarkably quiet. The operations against Hama Rashid of Baneh, which were referred to in my last quarterly despatch, resulted in the occupation with little opposition of Baneh and later of Sardasht and in the expulsion of Hama Rashid from Persian terri tory. He has now been removed from the vicinity of the frontier by the Iraqi authorities. The Persian Government have given up the plan to ask for Hama Rashid’s extradition but are asking for the sheep and other property which he carried off to be returned. On the other hand the Persian Government have not yet released the Jaf chiefs who were imprisoned some months ago, apparently in inhumane conditions, on the charge of crossing the frontier into Persia (1) without permission and (2) carrying arms. Most of the chiefs of this area have made their peace, for the time being, with the Persian authorities, and if the Persians were capable of just administration and a consistent policy they would now have the opportunity of relieving Kurdish fears and laying the foundations of a permanent settlement. Little has been heard recently from Persian Kurdestan of aspirations to autonomy, but Russian contacts with the Kurds, for whatever purpose they may be, are maintained. 59. Disarmament of the Arab tribes of Khuzestan continues. After some 1,000 rifles had been collected from the Arabs of the Ahu Dasht area the Persian troops turned their attention to the Beni Tufuf, who, with opposition from only1*2 a small section who fled to Iraq, surrendered some 1,300 rifles. The Beni Tamim' have now begun to hand in their arms. 60. In Kuh i Gain a delicately-balanced situation exists between the con flicting sections of the Boir Ahmadi. Both sides are wearying of the tension and showing a tendency to come to terms. Whether this will be to the benefit of their neighbours only time will show. There has certainly been less than the usual Boir Ahmadi raiding since the tribes were occupied in sparring with each other. 61. The so-called union of the tribes of the south continues to attract the interest of the Russians and the hostility of the Tudeh press. To both it looms as a plan organised by the British for the support of feudalism and reaction as a defence against the purer tenets of the Tudeh party, or more simply, as a scheme for the establishment of an armed bloc under British influence to be used, if necessary, against a Russian-inspired revolution of the working classes. According to this unfounded theory, not only do the reactionaries, by whom the the British are clearly meant, oppose any suggestion that these tribes should be disarmed, but they connive at the supply to them of arms and ammunition and may even supply them themselves. Finance. 62. Although over nine months of the financial year (which began on the 21st March, 1944) have gone by, the budget has not yet been passed by the Majlis and Government expenditure has been authorised by votes on account from month to month. Nor have the monthly figures of revenue and expenditure been published, but this embassy is informed that those for the first eight months of the year are as follows (figures for the preceding year are shown for comparison) :— 1943-44.Q 1944-45. 63. The estimates for 1944-45 show a deficit of 611 million rials on the Ordinary budget, and a surplus of 612 million on the Commercial budget. It is impossible to say at the moment how the Commercial budget will turn out, as the magnitude of the Government’s commercial operations, i.e., purchase and distribution of food-stuffs and other goods over the remainder of the year, has not yet been determined. It is clear, however, that the estimates for the Ordinary budget have proved over-optimistic. In particular, receipts from income tax will be very much below those estimated; so far they have been less than for the same period in 1943-44, when the rates were considerably lower. It seems hardly possible that expenditure can be kept to a sufficiently low figure to compensate for this failure. 64. Sales of gold for the account of His Majesty’s Government have continued during the quarter. The bulk of this gold is, as is known, smuggled over the border into Iraq; and sales have varied according to the demand there and in other Middle-Eastern countries, and the comparative ease or danger of the smuggling traffic from time to time. The price is adjusted periodically to the changing demand; but the market is a difficult one to forecast. The proceeds of sales during the quarter have been equivalent to £1-57 million. The question whether sales of gold should be continued has been raised separately. 65. The draft of the agreement covering the administration of the Persian railway system since September 1941, which is to be presented to the Persian Government by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics jointly, has still not been agreed by the Soviet authorities in Moscow, although there can no longer be any possible points of difference outstanding. It can only be concluded that the Soviet delay is deliberate. /i) The figures for 1943-44 differ to some extent from those previously given, and are indeed the third set of figures produced. The differences are the result of adjustments made between the Ordinary and Commercial budgets. It is to be hoped that the piesent figures are final. i Ordinary Revenue Ordinary Expenditure (million rials.) 2,871 2.582 2,263 ' 2,544 Surplus ... 608 38 Commercial Revenue Commercial Expenditure 1,364 2,228 2,355 2,841 i Deficit 864 486 t Net Deficit 256 448 * * ■■13 ^-'Economic Situation. 66. The course of the war since last June has resulted in some reduction of the cost-of-living figure. From 855 in August (July 1939 = 100) it went down to 656 in November; but there were fluctuations in the interval, and in December it increased again to 684. There will no doubt be periodical upturns rather ^ than a steep decrease unless the war comes to an earlier conclusion than is now ^generally expected. It is satisfactory, however, that wholesale and retail prices, between which there has been serious discrepancy in the past, are showing a tendency to come more closely together. 67. Credit restrictions by the banks and moneylenders continue to discourage the passage of goods from hand to hand among speculative merchants (which is a feature of Persian commerce), but the quarter has seen the usual steady purchases for provincial consumption after the sale of harvest. 68. The supply of goods from overseas under the aegis of the Middle East Supply Centre has been satisfactory throughout the quarter. Tea stocks are, in fact, so high that the Persian Government have decided in principle to forego their next (1945) allocation of tea from India. In addition to the sugar supplied by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, Persia continues to receive small imports by dhow and relatively small quantities from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, but the price of sugar on the open market (as distinct from the Government rations) has risen slightly during the period under review. Textiles are in good supply (but dear) and Swiss artificial silk remains plentiful although, of course, there have been no new arrivals. 69. During the quarter interest has been shown in the re-equipment of some local industries. The Tehran power station is to be extended and new machinery is to be installed in the country’s biggest glass factory as soon as deliveries can be effected. No such moves have been noticed in the textile industries, which are not expected to be able to compete with overseas production under peace-time conditions. Cereals and A gricultural Development. 70. In spite of a fortnight’s vindictive hold-up by the Soviet authorities of grain movements from the north of Persia to Tehran (as recorded in the first section of this despatch), grain has been coming in in good quantities and the stock of food grains in the Tehran silo amounted on the 31st December to over 53,000 tons including 31,897 of wheat and wheat-flour, and this ensures sufficiency for 265 days at the present rate of adulteration with barley. In general the Persian Government has in hand the unprecedented stock of 260,000 tons of bread grain. 71. The 1,000 tons of seed-wheat from India reached the Persian Gulf ports in November and was distributed by the Persian officials of the newly- created “ Selection of Agricultural Monopolies ” of Dr. Millspaugh’s Mission. 72. Of the twenty British army officers seconded to the Cereal Collection Team in the Millspaugh Mission, fourteen are to be released for grain collection work in Bengal (7) or return to military duty (7). Their good work has been much appreciated by the American Chief Administrator of Persian Agricultural Monopolies. T ransport. 73. Civil traffic on the railway was well maintained on the whole during the quarter. A lift of about 14,000 tons from south to north was achieved in October and was raised to over 22,000 tons in December. The average percent ages of the target figures which were achieved in the past year are announced as : Goods from ports 91 per cent., cereals 89 per cent, and sugar-beet 57 per cent. The Persian officials concerned deserve some of the credit for the way in which they are learning the task of movement control in difficult circumstances. “ 74. The Road Transport Administration’s position has been greatly improved by their taking over the contracts of Persian lorry owners who were formerly employed by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation on “Aid to Russia.” As a result it was possible (on the 22nd December) to make a slight relaxation in the Government’s control over privately-owned lorries. 75. The seasonal demands for haulage of cereals, sugar-beet and coal have been met, and the stocks of petroleum supplies throughout the country have been well maintained, except in Tehran where a large unexpected increase in the use of oil-drip stoves has caused a temporary reduction in reserves. Locust Control. 76. No locusts were present in Persia during the quarter.14 x 77. The normal invasion of desert (i.e., migratory) locust swarms from India during the autumn and early winter was prevented by efficient control in Sind and Rajputana, but there remains the probability that swarms will enter South Persia as a result of breeding which is now occurring in Arabia. 78. This danger was considered by an international conference at Tehran in November, and preliminary arrangements were made to meet it. The Persian Ministry of Agriculture’s probable requirements of motor vehicles have beei^ placed before their Road Transport Administration, and the Ministry’s stocks of bran and poison in the south are adequate. However, their probable commit ments are very large, and the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit has therefore under taken to carry out any control which may be necessary between Lingeh and Task. Its locust officer disposes of transport and radio vans supplied by the Persia and Iraq Force, and His Majesty’s Government are paying for the hire of local labour and have provided poison and bran. 79. The Government of India have agreed under certain conditions to carry out both survey and control work in the south-east corner of Persian Mekran, on the Indian frontier. Ways and means are now under discussion. 80. Moroccan (i.e., non-migratory) locust egg-deposits which have now been completely mapped indicate that over 110,000 hectares will have to be controlled at the hatching next spring—mainly in Azerbaijan and Gurgan. The Ministry of Agriculture is negotiating with the Soviet authorities for the purchase of oil cake meal as a bait material; and they have put before the Road Transport Administration a demand for the vehicles which will be required in this campaign. 81. During the period under review the Middle East Supply Centre office in Tehran took over from the embassy the work of co-ordinating locust reports, of representing the United Kingdom and Indian Governments on the Tehran International Locust Control Committee, and of maintaining liaison between the British locust officer in Persia and those concerned in and outside the country. United Nations Rehabilitation and Relief Administration, and the Polish Evacuees. 82. The total number of Polish evacuees in Persia diminished during the period under review from 5,440 to 4,435. Among those who left were seventy-nine students bound for Beirut University. Attempts are still being made to evacuate the remaining half of the Children’s School at Isfahan and their attendant grown-ups. Once they have gone, there will be no Poles left in Persia apart from (a) those employed by the British and American Armed Forces and Government organisations and (5) those living by their own efforts, who consequently are their own masters and free to leave or stay as they wish, subject only to Persian regula tions regarding fermis de sejour. 83. United Nations Rehabilitation and Relief Administration take no financial responsibility for these Polish refugees and, in fact, no responsibility other than that of ultimate repatriation. They are, however, prepared to act (without commitment) in a certain measure as regards transport, through what personnel they may have in the countries concerned. It is under stood that the reason for the United Nations Rehabilitation and Relief Administration’s attitude is that these Poles are not war refugees within the Administration’s definition of the term. British Council. 84. The Council is now responsible for instruction in English to over 4,000 Persians throughout the country, and the demand is increasing. Applications for teachers have been received from many provincial centres where there are as yet no Anglo-Persian Institutes, and textbooks have been sent to schools in these areas. The Institute in Tehran has overflowed into an Annexe. The Council has sponsored a series of concerts by the newly-formed Tehran Symphony Orchestra. The Orchestra has given two concerts, both of which were attended by more than 500 persons. In view of the absence in Tehran of a suitable hall for dramatic performances, the cellar of the Anglo-Persian Institute in Tehran has been converted into a little theatre. The theatre was inaugurated with five most successful performances of Wilde’s “ The Importance of Being Earnest.” 85.

The long-heralded arrival of the new American Ambassador, Mr. I^land^^^Tj Morris, at last took place on the 12th August. His Majesty's Charge d Affaires a ^ took an early opportunity to emphasise to him the urgent need for co-ordinating the views and policies of the American Advisers to the Persian Government. A c If the ambassador had come with any instructions in that sense, he did not &amp;*** reveal the fact, but he seemed to be impressed by the arguments used; in particular, he admitted the need for revision of the policy whereby the advisers were left &lt;j by the United States authorities to fend for themselves without guidance, as a~oP servants of the Persian Government. This was getting the worst of both J 5 qjl Concur worlds as the Persian authorities never credited the United States Government &lt;yx j^ with such disinterestedness. The Counsellor of the American Embassy, who was present at the interview, suggested that the United States Government had scruples about taking a hand in a sphere which they regarded as ours; addings . however, that he had done his best to convince the State Department of the complete willingness of the British to back the American Advisers in so far ^ as the latter represented something homogeneous to back. *o - 1&gt;'6. as the latter represented something homogeneous 3. As foreshadowed in my despatch under reference, the Persian Govern- ment decided early in July to allow Dr. Millspaugh to continue with his existing n powers for four months or so—the idea being to give him a last chance to show his worth. His stock, however, fell steadily during the subsequent weeks and ft**** early in August His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires reported that he appeared to h,/*,**, be accomplishing nothing which would justify his continued retention in public a service. Dr. Millspaugh injured his reputation further by an undiplomatic interview granted to a Tehran newspaper, in which he was reported to have said that the United States was the only country which had championed Persia’s 7 ' freedom and that if his mission had not been present in Persia one of the thn things would have happened : — {a) Disturbances leading to the occupation of North and South Persia by the Russians and the British respectively; {h) the occupation of the country by an international force; {c) a dictatorship even more rigorous than Reza Shah’s. The Soviet Ambassador thereupon proposed to Mr. Lascelles that they should make a joint demarche to the United States Charge d’Affaires asking him whether he considered these utterances as compatible with the spirit of the Tehran Conference Declaration. Mr. Lascelles declined, feeling that such an ^ 7 assault on the Americans was a poor way of demonstrating an Anglo-Russian solidarity for which the Soviet authorities here had hitherto shown little desire; but he undertook to remonstrate privately with the charge d’affaires. When he did so, he found the charge d’affaires most embarrassed and inclined to the view that the State Department had been awaiting just such a pretext for recalling Dr. Millspaugh. In fact, at the end of August, the State Department informed a member of His Majesty’s Embassy at Washington that Dr. Millspaugh had been recalled for consultation; they wished to defer a decision about his return to Persia until fhey had talked to him, but they that they thought it might well end in Dr. Black—the second in command—taking over. Mr. Lascelles’s comment on this was that the only possible course at this stage was for Dr. Millspaugh to be retained in the United States on some face-saving pretext and that although the fault was his in part only, his personal position [59—61] CcbuTt}( fe - r . 1 -. x 1 ^325 %- i.2 | was past praying for. Mr. Lascelles added that the new American Ambassador had reached the conclusion that no foreign adviser ought to be given the powers and responsibilities which were entrusted to Dr. Millspaugh, on the grounds that this stultified the Persian Constitution and was basically incompatible with the spirit of the Atlantic Charter. Dr. Millspaugh should share these responsibilties with the Majlis; all decrees should be signed jointly by both, and in the event of disagreement the Prime Minister should decide between them. At this point, however, Dr. Millspaugh’s obstinacy stood him in good stead; he refused to go to the United States, fearing some trap to keep him there and being certain that at best his powers would be reduced during his absence; he expressed the intention to retire next February after two years’ service, and meanwhile a successor should be brought out soon to be trained by him. The fact is that lately, owing to the war news, economic developments in Persia appear to be on the point of taking a favourable turn for Dr. Millspaugh and he is shrewd enough to see that if he hangs on for a few more months he may leave with much less discredit than now. 4. The future of all the American Advisory Missions was under review during the present period. The United States Charge d’Affaires told Mr. Lascelles at the beginning of August that the United States Government were extremely irritated by the lack of Persian co-operation with the missions and might withdraw them before long. His Majesty’s Government thereupon explained to the United States Government that they were most anxious for the American Missions to remain, and in certain cases to be strengthened, since they were convinced that Persia’s need for foreign assistance would continue to be great, particularly in the immediate post-war period; they were especially concerned about the future of the Persian police; when Allied troops are with- J drawn a large measure of responsibility for internal security would fall on the police, which, in its present state, was quite unable to bear it; this might have particularly serious consequences in the oil area. His Majesty’s Government were anxious, therefore, that reforms should be put in hand before the departure of British troops. These could not be carried out without foreign assistance and they would prefer that this should be provided by the United States, if possible; if, however, the United States Government felt unable to provide it, His Majesty’s Government would have to consider advising the Persian Government to look elsewhere. His Majesty’s Government added that if the American Military Mission was going to be withdrawn, the Anglo-American plan for the supply of equipment for the Persian army would need to be reconsidered. The State Department replied that the United States Govern ment were not losing interest in Persia, but they had no fixed policy of retaining advisory missions there. They had, for instance, always made it clear to the Persian Government that American advisers must not be exposed to vilification : if attacked, the Persian Government must defend them, otherwise they would be withdrawn and would not be replaced. The following decisions had been recently taken by the United States Government:— (1) Colonel Schwarzkopf and his five assistants would be left for a further year with the gendarmerie. (2) Instructions would be sent to the United States Ambassador in Tehran to investigate whether Colonel Schwarzkopf might take over the police as well. (3) General Ridley would remain until the 1st March, 1945, by which date the War Department thought that he would have done all he could to accomplish his task; the War Department would probably decline to appoint a successor and were inclined to concentrate on the gendarmerie and police. His Majesty’s Charge d’Afiaires’ comment on these decisions was that Colonel Schwarzkopf could not take over the police unless he obtained five additional men of his own choosing; he had, however, been told that he could not have them while the war lasted. Mr. Lascelles added that General Ridley would not have accomplished by the 1st March, 1945, all the work covered by his contract. This work comprised the drawing up of plans of organisation under numerous heads and supervising their execution; and under the majority of these heads even the planning stage had not been reached. In the opinion of the military attach^ to his embassy such work as General Ridley had achieved would rapidly be undone if he left next spring. Mr. Lascelles went on to discuss how far the possession of an efficient army would really be useful and necessary to Persia in post-war conditions, given a reformed and larger gendarmerie. As long as • 4 si \3 the present Shah remained on the throne, the army would play a preponderant role in the country’s affairs and remain the chief instrument of internal security; for the Americans to concentrate on the gendarmerie and police would be all very well if they obtained an increasing share of the revenue at the expense of the Shah’s ideas for his army; the continued presence of General Ridley’s mission would not entirely solve this problem, but would at least alleviate it sufficiently give Colonel Schwarzkopf a fair chance. His Majesty’s Government there- 'upon urged the United States Government to let Colonel Schwarzkopf have his five extra men so as to enable him to take over the police. His Majesty’s Govern- men found it difficult, however, to contest General Ridley’s estimate that he would have finished his work by March 1945, so they confined themselves to asking whether, in the event of Lis task not being completed by that date, the War Department would let him stay on until he had finished. As regards the gendarmerie and police, the State Department agreed (a) that this was of first importance; (b) that reforms should be pressed before the departure of the Allied troops; {c) that the probable departure of General Ridley made it desirable for action to be started at once, and they urged the War Department to provide the five extra men needed by Colonel Schwarzkopf. As regards General Ridley, they stated that the War Department did not hold out much hope of keeping him on beyond March 1945 unless he himself recommended it. His Majesty’s Govern ment took the opportunity to repeat that the problem of co-ordinating the work of the American Advisers in Persia was still a pressing one, and that the future success of the American Missions would depend very largely on the degree of cohesion which the American Ambassador was able to bring about. The State Department agreed to this and said that the United States Ambassador would do his best. 5. A Military Air Attache has been appointed to the United States Embassy in Tehran and to the United States Legation in Bagdad. Soviet Affairs. 6. The censorship controversy between the British and Soviet authorities in Persia came to a head during the period under review. On the 30th June the British Joint Director of the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Censorship had made the following requesls to his Soviet colleague u — (a) That British and United States publications exported to British and United States companies and residents in Persia respectively should invariably be released. (b) That article 5 of memorandum establishing the joint censorship should be strictly observed. (This gives exemption from censorship to the Persian Government and to the missions of foreign Governments with which the British, Soviet and Persian Governments are all in diplomatic relations.) (c) That publications condemned by the Soviet section should be returned to the sender through the British section. The Soviet director undertook to convey these requests to Moscow for instructions. When informing the Foreign Office of this I added that the Russians should be called upon to justify their request for the condemnation of any British publication exported from the United Kingdom under censorship permit and that objection should be made from our side to anything casting a slight upon British history, institutions or personalities. In the course of July the British section of the censorship acquired a competent Russian reader, with a result that they were now able to study the Russian material coming into this country. The offensive material divides broadly into three categories :— (a) Maps showing the 1941 Soviet boundaries. (The Soviet section are suppressing all British maps showing any other Soviet boundaries, even though they are expressly marked as showing pre-1939 boundaries.) (b) Disparaging references to the Polish Government. (This is forbidden by Middle East censorship stops.) (c) Books criticising capitalism as exemplified by the British Empire. (The Soviet censor has been condemning a great mass of British material— including several copies of Punch —on vague ideological grounds.) When two months had passed and the Soviet censor had still received no instructions from Moscow, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires informed His [59—61] ^ b 24 Majesty’s Government that retaliation alone would cure the present unsatisfactory situation. His Majesty’s Government approved the policy of retaliation, but suggested that Mr. Laseelles should first try to induce the Soviet Embassy to call the battle off, taking the line that censorship of this kind was now out of date and should be discontinued, and adding a hint that this was a game that two could play. As a first step, Mr. Lascelles requested the British censor to attempt to settle the matter with his Soviet colleague on the basis prescribed by the Foreign^ Office. This failed, so Mr. Lascelles took the matter up with the Soviet Ambassador, pointing out in addition that the discrepancy between their interpretation and ours was having a most undesirable effect on the Persian population. It was giving them an entirely one-sided picture of all those ideological questions on which the Russians and ourselves thought differently and this could not be allowed to go on. M. Maximov replied that before admitting that the Soviet censor was being too strict he must have copious examples of his methods to study, as also examples of the British censor’s more liberal attitude. His impression was that, on the contrary, British papers and periodicals were highly critical of the Soviet Union, while Soviet papers and periodicals permitted themselves no criticism of their Allies. Mr. Lascelles undertook to supply material on both points. This he did in a letter repeating the points prescribed by the Foreign Office. As it was evident, however, that the Soviet Ambassador was playing for time, Mr. Lascelles added that in order to redress the present unequal balance pending a settlement of the controversy, he had authorised the British censor to hold up the release of certain Soviet publications which were unacceptable to the British authorities on the basis of a purely political censorship. 7. Another point of discord was that the Soviet censor, in the course of September took to vetoing practically all the material provided by the Polish Legation for their weekly broadcast on Tehran radio. 8. At the end of the period under review the Persian Prime Minister informed me that he was disturbed about the Soviet attitude and activities. For instance :— (a) The Soviet Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs had come to Tehran to request an oil concession for the Soviet Government in North Persia. (b) The Soviet Transport Organisation, “Iransovtrans,” was beginning to operate as though it were a commercial transport company, but was disregarding Persian transport regulations. (c) The Soviet authorities had still not given permission for additional Persian troops to go to Rezaieh, but instead had offered to help maintain order among the Kurds. {d) A Soviet hospital and school in Tabriz has been opened without the permission of the Persian Government having been asked. The school was allegedly for Soviet children only, but in point of fact Persian subjects were also accepted. Moreover, Turki was the main language and Persian only subsidiary. (Please see also sections entitled “Economic Situation,” “Transport” and “ Oil Concessions ” for further details of Russian penetration.) A nglo-Soviet-Persian Censorship. 9. The controversy with the Soviet authorities regarding the condemnation of publications on ideological grounds is described under the heading “ Soviet Affairs.” 10. The British authorities concerned are now considering what should happen to this censorship after Germany’s defeat, and the British Director has collected the views of the British organisations in Persia interested in the matter. The view of this embassy is that the interests of the security authorities concerned will be adequately safeguarded by a censorship covering telegrams and letters only. Probably, indeed, the censorship of letters could be abandoned without risk, since the only subjects likely to interest the Japanese are the movements of shipping in the Persian Gulf and sabotage of the oil-fields, and information on the former subject must be transmitted rapidly to be of any use. The embassy have, however, no great objection to the continuance of letter censorship from the political point of view, and it would have some theoretical justification as long as Turkey and Afghanistan continue to provide bases for Japanese diplomats. The embassy are particularly anxious, on the other hand, to abolish the political and ideological censorship of newspapers and periodicals, since this leads to Anglo-Russian friction. * 75 Aid to Russia, 11. The month of July beat all records for tonnage delivered to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. August and September were also very heavy months, and in all cases the target plan figures for transport by rail and truck were exceeded. In July the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation commenced to hand over its Lend-Lease trucks to United States Motor Transport Service and the balance of these Lend-Lease trucks were handed over in the latter half of August, leaving only the Persian contractors’ vehicles, about 400, which are clearing up the small balance of Aid-to-Russia cargo left over at the end of September. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have therefore ceased to lift Lnion of Soviet Socialist Republics’ cargo and are awaiting final instructions from London to close down their truck operations both in Western and in Eastern Persia. Owing to the small number of ships with Aid-to-Russia cargo arriving at Persian Gulf ports in October'Basra will not discharge any of these ships and the British Army Vehicle Assembly Plant at Rafidiyah will cease to assemble imported vehicles for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The total target for Union of Soviet Socialist Republics’ cargo in October is considerably lower than for preceding months. This is no doubt due to the convoys by the northern route having started again under cover of the longer nights. Polish Affairs. 12. United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration took over the handling of the Polish evacuees from Middle East Relief and Refugee Administration during the period under review. At the opening of the period there were about 6,800 Poles in Persia altogether. Early in July nearly 1,200 left for India and East Africa. About 100, mostly young girls, nave left to join the Polish army. The total number at present in Persia is 5,440, of whom about 2,400 are in the Tehran area (800 being in the camp, the remainder in the town), 1,000 at Ahwaz, and just under 2,000 at the school at Isfahan. Some five months ago the New Zealand Govern ment extended an invitation through the Polish Government for 700 children to come to New Zealand. After protracted discussion and a good deal of confusion and delay, this offer was accepted and 700 children escorted by 140 grown-ups left for New Zealand on the 2nd October. Mr. Haluch, the delegate of the Ministry of Social Welfare, who was in charge of the refugees, was relieved of his duties with effect from the 1st September. His successor is a M. Pokladski, who is easy to deal with and not inefficient. The change has had a beneficial effect on the relations of the delegature with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and with the Polish community. Indian Affairs. 13. The considerable interest in India aroused by the visit of the Persian Cultural Mission has been maintained and steps have been taken to place cultural relations between the two countries on a firmer basis by the creation of a Standing Committee in Tehran, which will have its counterpart in India and which will concern itself with the advancement of cultural relations of every kind between Persia and India. An offer by the Government of India of a series of scholarships for technical education of Persian students has been accepted by the Persian Government, and the grant of further scholarships for training in agriculture is under consideration. Arrangements have been completed for the deputation of four Indian teachers of English to organise classes in Meshed, Kerman and Yezd and the teachers are on their w T ay to take up their appointments. The demand for facilities for learning English is widespread, and the appointment of these Indian teachers should assist materially in an important activity which is primarily the concern of the British Council, but which, through lack of staff, they are unable to pursue adequately. 14. India’s interest in the expansion of her post-war export trade is evidenced by the establishment of a Trade Commissioner in Tehran. The first Indian Trade Commissioner is expected to take up his duties in about two months’ time.6 15. The Indian community in the capital, having been purged of its most undesirable elements, is beginning to show a greater interest in the part which ' its members must play as ambassadors of their country, and their change of heart has been shown in the very generous contributions which the community has 1 made to India’s war effort, in the form of donations and investments in Govern ment of India war bonds. Anglo-Persian Public Relations. 16. Allied successes in Western Europe have created optimism as to the likelihood of an early peace. The fall in prices, towards the end of this period, resulting from the war news, has probably tended to make the man-in-the-street slightly less critical of British policy in Iran. Fear of possible Russian post-war designs against Persia have not been reflected in an any more liberal outlook towards Great Britain by the public or in the press, although it is no doubt hoped that Great Britain will restrain any aggressive designs by Russians against Persia. 17. The vernacular press, while preoccupied with internal problems, has given favourable notice to Allied successes. The left press and certain other minor papers have endeavoured to represent the efforts of the mullas to regain political power as being inspired by international capitalism and imperialist powers, but this appears to have had little effect on the more sober elements constituting public opinion. Their claims that the ground is being prepared for a new dictatorship by Seyyid Zia, under the tutelage of these-same elements have perhaps received rather more credence. This propaganda tends to prejudice the public against Great Britain. 18. Mr. Savidge’s period of secondment from the Government of India having come to an end, Mr. Graham took over the post of Director of Public Relations at the beginning of the period under review. Under Mr. Savidge the Bureau did better propaganda at a greatly diminished cost, and since even the Persian is now convinced that the Allies are going to win the war, it is considered that economies can continue to be made without harm to the interests of His Majesty’s Government. Post-War Propaganda Policy of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. 19. The probable early conclusion of hostilities in Europe has led to a recon sideration of propaganda policy in Persia, Emphasis has been laid on the need for greater concentration on such long-term matters as publicity for British and Commonwealth trade in the post-war period, and active steps have already been taken by the Government of India to implement this policy so far as India is concerned. British Council A ctivities. 20. 1 he departure of the Council’s representative in Persia, Mr. Bingley, was the occasion of a farewell reception held at the Anglo-Persian Institute, Tehran. Over 500 members and students attended including representatives of the Diplomatic Corps, the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet. Many tributes were paid to the work done by Mr. Bingley during his two years in Iran. Mr. C. H. Owen has been appointed representative. 21. The total number of books handled during the quarter exceeded 21,000. Open-air film shows at Tehran and the provinces at institutes, schools and sports organisations were attended by over 20,000 persons. Despite the hottest recorded summer in fifty years, summer courses were held in the Tehran Institute in addition to the Alborz College evening classes. Twenty classes for 244 students were held at the Shemran Summer School outside Tehran. A soiree given bv the Council in commemoration of Anton Tchekov was attended by the^Russian Ambassador and other notabilities and the drama section produced a scene from Hamlet and The Seagull in the open-air theatre for the occasion. A production of A Midsummer Night's Dream in the open air was an unqualified success, playing for two nights to over 600 people. Members of the Isfahan Institute totalled 424. Summer courses included a men’s teachers’ class and a class for hospital nurses. Teaching of Polish children was continued and English classes for the Armenian colony at Julfa have been started. Some 500 students have been enrolled and twenty classes started at the new Anglo-Persian Institute at Shiraz.Internal Politics and Majlis. 22. The position of the Cabinet remained precarious throughout July and August, and it was only the absence of any general agreement as to who should succeed Sa’id that kept it in office. Several candidates were mentioned including ^Hajhir, Ardalan, Ahi, Soheily, Hussein Sami'i, and Qawam-es-Saltaneh. Our objections to the latter had previously been explained to the Shah, the then Prime Minister, and the Soviet Ambassador, and were made clear to an inter mediary sent to this embassy in mid-August. It was generally considered that Seyyid Zia had too much opposition against him for his appointment to be possible. He himself was understood to favour the appointment of Hussein Sami’i with a team of young men. 23. The Cabinet started the period badly. Having first of all, at the behest of the Majlis, taken a strong line against Millspaugh, it eventually found itself explaining to the Majlis that it had agreed to keep him for another few months to see whether he could produce any results. The change of front by the Majlis majority appears to have been due as much to the reflection that since the Shah and the Russians both wanted Millspaugh removed there might be some value in him after all, as to the fear that the American Government might cut ofl supplies. 24. By the middle of August Majlis opinion had come round to the view that the best temporary solution would be for Sa’id to reshuffle his Cabinet. An interpellation which was to have taken place on the 17th August was accordingly postponed to the 28th August to enable him to make any changes he thought fit. In the interval Sa’id, after prolonged discussions, having obtained a promise of support from a coalition of eighty-five Deputies of the Mihan, Ittehad-i-Milli and Azadi fractions, resigned on the 26th August and was entrusted with the formation of a new Cabinet. 25. The new Cabinet, chosen by Sa’id in consultation with his supporters in the Majlis, was presented to the Shah on the 31st August. Apart from the Prime Minister himself the only other member of the previous Cabinet to be included was Khalil Fahimi, Minister without Portfolio. Three other members of the new Cabinet, Baqir Kazimi, Allahyar Saleh and Muhammad Nariman, who became Ministers of Education, Justice and Communications respectively, had previously held Cabinet rank. Ali Asghar Zarinkafsh, Dr. Muhammad Nakhai and Muhammad Sururi, who had been satisfactory Under-Secretaries, were appointed Ministers of Finance, Commerce and Industry, and Interior, and Dr. Manuchihr Iqbal became Acting Minister of Health. The Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs was given to a comparatively unknown official named Yusuf Mushar, and the Ministry of Agriculture was left vacant. The Prime Minister himself took over the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. General Muhammad Hussein Firuz, Governor-General of Fars, was offered the Ministry of War but after a visit to Tehran he refused. 26. Opposition to the new Cabinet was immediately encountered from the Tudeh party, who objected to the return of Sa’id, and from the Independents in the Majlis, who resented the fact that they had not been consulted. When Sa’id attempted on the 2nd September to introduce his Cabinet to the Majlis the Opposition elements absented themselves from the Chamber, with the result that the necessary quorum was lacking. Discussions lasting a fortnight followed before the Cabinet finally obtained its vote of confidence from the Majlis on the 17th September, 73 out of the 100 members present voting in its favour. Although Sa’id continued to enjoy the support of the coalition majority up to the end of September, the position of his Government remained unstable owing to the opposition of the Tudeh and the Russians. The Shah also was not favourably disposed to it because it contained none of his nominees. 27. During the period under review the Majlis itself spent little time on legislation, being more occupied with intrigue over the composition of Cabinets and the credentials of Deputies. Some excitement was caused in July by the rejection by a narrow majority of the credentials of a Tudeh-sponsored Deputy from Tabriz, the way having been prepared by the prior rejection of those of an independent Deputy who headed the poll. The rejection of Pishavari’s credentials was greeted with a storm of criticism in the Tudeh press; there was considerable agitation in Tabriz and the acting Soviet Consul-General expressed his displeasure. The excitement was short lived, however, and by the end of August there was general indifference in Tabriz to the fate of the Soviet- supported Deputies. The credentials of the other Communist Deputies of8 Azerbaijan who were elected with the support of the Russians have not vet come up for examination, but it is possible that they too will be rejected by a Majlis emboldened by its success in rejecting Pishavari, though the Soviet Embassy are working hard to prevent this. 28. Elections have not yet been completed at Abadeh and R e y- ^ e Y elections are due for two Tabriz seats, for Darajiz and for Ear, where the deat i of Azadi has left a vacancy. The credentials of Dr. Falsafi, Deputy for Gurgan,, were accepted by the Majlis. The number of Deputies so far elected whose credentials have not been rejected by the Majlis is 128. . 29. There was some party activity during the period under review, hrom the 1st—12th August the Tudeh party held its first general conference at Tehran. Decisions were taken to tighten up party discipline, purge the membeiship, and set up an Inspection Committee, to deal with disciplinary matters and watch the Central Committee of the party. The resolutions passed confirmed the hostility of the party to Seyyid Zia, all foreign advisers, and the grant of economic concessions “ which constrict or weaken the economic independence of the Persian nation,” such as presumably the grant of new oil concessions to American or British companies. ^ m . . . , , , ■ 30. The President of the Majlis, Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai, enlarged his Majlis group into a party entitled “ Mardum ” (people), which adopted as its programme union in the defence of true constitutional and democratic Govei n- ment. A party called “ Kar ” (work) was formed by Dr. Musharraf Nafisi; it had a lengthy programme of good intentions but its real aim seemed to be to promote its founder’s candidature for the post of Prime Minister, an ambition which has little chance of being realised in view of Dr. Nafisi s unpopularity in the Majlis. ^ • 31. Towards the end of August efforts to form a Government majority in the Majlis appeared at last to be successful. Some eighty-five Deputies of the three fractions, the Mihan, the Azadi, and the Ittihad-i-Milli (which is more or less identical with the Mardum group) agreed to combine to support S3; id s reconstituted Cabinet. The coalition thus formed survived, rather surprisingly up to the end of September, in spite of the efforts of the Tudeh and the Russians to break it up. _ , . r 32. The death of the ex-Shah, on the 26th July, caused no grief except in the Palilavi family circle, and the present Shah was much criticised on the grounds that the mourning which he ordered was too elaborate. Some papers criticised Reza Shah’s work and regime severely, and no section of the press made any attempt to reach a balanced appraisement of his life and work The ludeh party publicly dissociated themselves from any mourning (many of their leaders had been imprisoned by the ex-Shah), and expelled from their party one of then Deputies who had attended a mourning ceremony. 33. Seyyid Zia, however, took the opportunity to attempt to establish better relations with the Shah and called specially to condole. The effect was somewhat spoiled by violent criticism of the ex-Shah in Rad-i-Imruz, which is regarded as the Seyyid’s paper. Signs were, however, not lacking that the Shah s hostility to Seyyid Zia was decreasing, and by the end of August a definite reconciliation appeared to have been effected. After several interviews a considerable measure of agreement was believed to have been reached between them, and the Shah spoke of Seyyid Zia as a man with whom it should be possible to work. The Shah’s attitude was undoubtedly influenced by his realisation that the Tudeh were not to be appeased, and by increasing fears of Soviet intentions in Azerbaijan, with the consequent need for a strong man to arrest the deterioration in the political situation. After considering all other possible candidates, including Taquizadeh, who was thought to be unwilling to accept the task, and Ahi, who could not be spared from Moscow, the Shah appeared to be coming to the conclusion that he might perhaps be well advised to make use of the vigorous personality of Seyyid Zia in an effort to stand up to the Russians. When the reconciliation became known Seyyid Zia’s stock rose in Tehran, but there were many who doubted whether the Shah’s professed desire to co-operate with him was genuine. 34. The Persian Ambassadors in London, Angora, Moscow and Cairo were summoned to Tehran for consultation with their Government on post-war problems concerning Persia. The two former arrived in September. Majid Ahi did not come from Moscow as he was said to be too ill to travel, and Jam has not yet arrived from Cairo. In many quarters hopes were expressed that Taqizadeh might prove to be the man to take charge of his country’s fortunes in her present hour of need, but Taqizadeh is apparently anxious to return to London.9 Tribal Situation. j 35. The tribes of Ears, except for some fighting between sections of the Boir Ahmadi, have remained remarkably quiet during the period under review. Brigandage is endemic in Ears, but incidents have been rarer than usual; and few can be attributed to the Qashgai. There has also been an absence of the | usual summer raiding by Boir Ahmadi across the Abadeh—Isfahan road and ! into the district of Yazd. Some credit for the unusual order prevailing may fairly be given to the influence of British officials and to the belief that British influence in Tehran will be used in favour of these tribes who have not misbehaved. The pact of friendship to which reference was made in my despatch under reference between Qavam ul Mulk and Nasir Qashgai, later joined by Morteza Quli Khan, the Bakhtiari Governor of Bakhtiari, has also contributed to peace by removing, for the time being at least, some of the causes of unrest that lay in long-standing mutual antagonisms. This pact has been represented as an alliance of the tribes of the south. It is hardly that, since Qavam-ul Mulk, although still retaining some influence among the Khamseh tribes, cannqt be said to be a tribal leader; he is concerned mainly with the protection against the Qashgai of the remaining interests of his family in Ears. We are, of course, suspected of having fathered the pact as part of a plan to form a zone of British influence in the south in opposition to the supposedly increasing influence of the Russian- inspired Tudeh party. 36. The Boir Ahmadi tribes of Kuh-i-Galu are at loggerheads with each other. Since unity between these turbulent tribes usually means trouble for their neighbours, it is no bad thing in present circumstances that they should work off their pugnacity on each other, provided that disturbance can be restricted to the limits of their own territory. The present quarrels arise from the high-handed actions of Abdullah Khan Zarghampur, a chief of the tribe, an absconder from Persian detention in Tehran and a close associate of Nasir Qashgai, who has been attempting to impose himself as paramount chief and to seize land claimed by other chiefs. The opposition to him is being encouraged by Persian officials, but, in view of Abdullah Khan’s association with Nasir Qashgai, the necessity for caution has been impressed on the Persian Government lest the Qashgai should be driven to intervene, involving other tribes in Ears hostile to them and so extending disorder beyond the limits of the Boir Ahmadi country. 37. In Bakhtiari rumblings of discontent against Morteza Quli Khan have continued, but peace has been maintained. Some rather futile operations were carried out by the Persian army for the disarmament of the Moghui and Mamivand sections of the Chahar Lang Bakhtiari, most of whom lie outside the limits of Morteza Quli Khan’s jurisdiction. Some arms were collected, but, it seems, mostly from the settled elements of the tribes, and the Mamivand nomads remain in possession of some 2,000-2,500 rifles. 38. In Khuzestan the operation for the disarmament of the disorderly Arabs of the Ahu Dasht area, which was referred to in my last despatch, was completed by the Persian forces with unusual efficiency and creditable moderation. In ali, some 1,000 rifles were collected. A number of Arabs were arrested, and seven of them were hanged, with good effect on the Arabs in general, who did not question the justice of the punishment. Both civil and military Persian officials in Khuzestan are insistent that advantage should be taken of the mood induced in the Arabs by this display of Persian authority to extend the collection of arms, of which there are estimated still to be some 6,000-7,000 in Khuzestan, to other Arab tribes; and they are confident that, given a suitable show of force, the collection can be made without opposition. Since it is important for the post-war security of Khuzestan, and particularly of the interests of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, that the number of unlicensed rifles in the hands of the Arabs should be reduced, I have raised no objection to the Bani Turuf being summoned to surrender their arms. My information, admittedly somewhat conjectural, is that they are likely to make some show of complying. 39. Kurdistan, particularly that part of it that lies within the Russian zone of occupation in Persia, has been causing the Persian Government increasing anxiety. Reports, probably exaggerated, have been reaching Tehran of Russian encouragement of Kurdish aspirations to autonomy. Persian suspicions of Russian designs have been intensified by the refusal of the Russians to allow the Persian Government to maintain in Azerbaijan forces of sufficient strength to take effective action against Kurdish lawlessness. The popular theory 5 [59—61] c10 ! in Persian circles is that on the withdrawal of Russian troops the Kurds will : be incited to launch out on a campaign of pillaging which the Persian authorities j will be unable to suppress; the people of Azerbaijan will then appeal to the Soviet Government to come to their protection. So that they can play their part in this plan, the Kurds must be protected against Persian attempts to subdue or disarm them. 40. The alleged movement for Kurdish independence is reported to be directed, as far as Persian Kurdestan is concerned, by a Kurdish notable, Qazi Muhammad of Mahabad. He is supposed to be in alliance with Hama Rashid of Baneh, and both are reported to have received visits from Soviet officials. Hama Rashid was in rebellion against the Persian Government in 1942 and was successful in wresting from them a settlement which left him in effective control of the Baneh district, with no semblance of Persian authority, and with a subsidy nominally for the maintenance of order. For some time past some Persian authorities have held the view that the autonomous position secured by Hama Rashid was a dangerous encouragement to Kurdish aspirations; and they have been considering the advisability of establishing, by force if necessary, an administration in Baneh with some outward evidence of Persian Government authority. My advice was that any such measure should be preceded or accom panied by an announcement of Government policy and some concrete evidence of an intention to provide some benefits to the Kurdish tribes. Hama Rashid, however, played into the hands of the Persian General Staff, who were the principal advocates of a forward policy, by attacking the village of Merivan, the headquarters of another Kurdish chief whom the Persian Government had voluntarily put into a position similar to that occupied by Hama Rashid at Baneh. The Persian Government accepted the view that this was a direct challenge to their authority, and they ordered the despatch of a column to expel Hama Rashid’s followers from Merivan. This has been accomplished with little or no opposition. At the end of the period under review operations were being initiated for the occupation of Baneh, though there are Persians in and outside the Government who are averse from provoking the Kurds at present. Persian Land Forces. 41. The army has made little progress. There is perhaps a slight improve ment in morale, due to a few minor operations having been carried out without disaster, and corruption and embezzlement are less in evidence. The Govern ment has not as yet decided on a policy as regards its forces, and the size of both the army and gendarmerie is considerably above what can be efficiently main tained on the funds available. In both forces there is much discontent and among the better officers a feeling of despair and of disappointment at the failure of the American advisers to effect any lasting reforms General Ridley now takes a very restricted view of the scope of his mission, much narrower than he is authorised to do by the terms of his engagement. His influence is less and less in evidence. The activities of his mission are now limited to matters of transport, of supply and to giving unheeded advice about the medical services. His scheme for the centralised training of recruits has been abandoned after a limited and unhappy trial. He says that his task, which he now interprets as little more than the organisation of systems of supply, transport and accounting, will be finished in a few months. If, however, he could be persuaded that his task is not only to inaugurate a system but to remain long enough to see it firmly established, the effect would, I feel sure, be quickly evident. 42. The forceful personality of General Razinara, the Chief of the Staff, in contrast with the inertia of the Government is pushing the army into greater prominence in the affairs of the provinces, particularly in tribal areas. He is shamelessly filling all important appointments with his own friends; his self- confidence and his ambition increase, but he is, I think genuinely, anxious to co-operate with us for the present. 43. Colonel Schwarzkopf continues to work with great energy, and regrettably little visible result. Encouraged by some Deputies and other influential persons who would like to see the gendarmerie established in a more important position than the army, he aims at an organisation which he estimates would require three years to build up and whose cost would be justifiable only if the army were reduced to a small striking force. However desirable that might be, it does not seem to be realisable in the near future; and it is the efficiency of the gendarmerie in the near future that is of primary interest to us. Towards that very little progress is evident. But it is reasonable to expect that Colonel * A If ; ( A.11 Schwarzkopf’s energy and drive will produce results in time. Handicapped as he is by inadequate funds, inadequate American staff, the lack of any co-ordinated ‘policy on the part of the Government and an unwillingness on his part to admit that the best may sometimes be the enemy of the good, he could perhaps not fairly be expected to have effected much improvement in the time in an organisation as demoralised, as lethargic and as lacking in any laudable ideal as the Persian ^ gendarmerie. Persian Air Force. 44. The fifteen Anson aircraft have now been delivered but, as the air force , has virtually no petrol, little use is being made of them. 45. The Persian Air Attache in London, Sarhang Bayendor, is in Tehran discussing His Majesty’s Government’s offer to sell Hurricane aircraft to the Persian Air Force and to provide training facilities for Persian officers. 46. Sarlashkar Nakchevan has now been in charge of the air force for some two months producing no noticeable change in its efficiency. He talks good sense about present and future policy, but there is little reason to hope that his practice will be as good as his precept. Civil Airlines. 47. None of the three Dominies ordered by the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones for the State Airline has yet been delivered. In consequence the airline has been obliged to discontinue its one service between Tehran and Bagdad, while its sole remaining aircraft undergoes annual overhaul. 48. There is considerable interest in future civil airlines. A powerful group, including Sarlashkar Nakhchevan, G. H. Ebtehaj (Mayor of Tehran and Director of Irantour,” the Persian tourist agency), an independent Deputy called Panahi and a merchant, Kooros, is talking about separating the State airline from Government control and setting up a commercial company for which they hope to obtain the Government mail contract. Representatives of British Overseas Airways Corporation have recently visited Tehran to discuss the possibilities of British co-operation in Persian air transport. 49. Meanwhile the Russians continue to operate their internal services. They have had one serious accident in which a British officer was among those killed. Finance. 50. The new Minister of Finance, Zarinkafsh, is a considerable improvement on his predecessor. In particular, he seems far more prepared than his predecessor to co-operate with Dr. Millspaugh. 51. The budget for the year 1323 (beginning on the 21st March, 1944) has been under consideration by the Budgetary Commission of the Majlis for some months past, and has not yet been before the Majlis itself. According to the present figures, revenue and expenditure under the ordinary budget are estimated at 3,958 and 4,569 million rials respectively; and revenue and expenditure under the commercial budget at 6,367 and 5,755 million. No figures of revenue or expenditure for the current year have yet been published, but the financial counsellor is informed that for the first five months of the year, i.e., up to the 22nd August, they have been as follows. The figures for the same months in the preceding year are given for comparison. • / Ordinary Budget. (Millions of rials.) 52 1322. 1323. Revenue ... ... ... ... ... 1534 1170 Expenditure ... ... 1349 1317 Commercial Budget. (Millions of rials.) 1322. 1323. Revenue ... ... ... ... ... 1169 1911 Expenditure 1382 1867 52. In the meantime, as the budget has not yet been approved by the Majlis, expenditure has been financed by votes on account; sometimes, however, passed [59—61] d12 so late that the salaries due to the unhappy-Government servants have been in arrear. It is impossible, of course, at the present stage, to make any forecast of the out-turn for the year as a whole. Revenue is behind-hand because of the delay in passing the income tax regulations, and it appears quite certain that the estimate of 885 million rials from this source for the year will not be reached. At the present time the Government have only been able to tide over their difficulties by obtaining an advance of £770,000 from the Anglo-Iranian Oil ^ Company in respect of royalties, and the exchequer is in debit nearly up to the limit of its authorised overdraft of 500 millions with the National Bank. Similarly, the municipalities are in financial difficulty; the 3 per cent, tax on goods coming into their areas was abolished as from the end of the last financial year, and has been replaced by a surtax on the income tax, which they have not yet received. They have been given short-term loans amounting in all to 36 million rials from the funds of the National Bank. 53. During the quarter the price index has gone down slightly. The cost of living figure, which was 1,124 in May, was 1,122 in June, 1,100 in July, 1,121 in August, and 1,095 in September (1936 = 100). Note circulation, which was 6,261 million rials in June, was 6,235 million in July and 6,125 million in August. 54. Sales of gold for the account of His Majesty’s Government were high in the first part of the quarter, having amounted to 56 million rials in the four weeks ending the 27th July, and 92 million in the five weeks ending the 31st August. Since then sales have declined substantially. In the weeks ending the 7th and 14th September they were 1-2 and 1-6 million rials respectively. In the week ending the 21st September they were 35,840 rials only. This decline is clearly the result of the course of the war. The price has been reduced in the hope of stimulating sales. 55. A delegation, led by A. H. Ebtehaj, the governor of the National Bank, was sent by the Government to the International Financial and Monetary Conference at Bretton Woods during July. The contribution of Persia to the stabilisation fund was fixed at 25 million dollars, and its contribution to the capital of the bank at 24 million dollars. These contributions, of course, require ratification by the Majlis. 56. As was expected at the time the last report was written, the United States Government have declared that they do not wish to be a signatory to the agreement for the operation of the Persian railway system, which will therefore, when the time comes, be signed by the British, Russian and Persian Governments only. The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are, however, still delaying their decisions on two points of detail arising on the draft agree ment, and it is impossible for the Russian and British Missions in Tehran to present it to the Persian authorities until these points have been settled. The continued delay is most unfavourable. Economic Situation. 57. At the end of the quarter wholesale prices had fallen, in the case of some commodities quite considerably, so that even a number of bankruptcies were reported from different parts of the country; but this was almost certainly more the result of the war news than of measures applied by Dr. Millspaugh or any other authority. Retail prices showed little signs of following suit and the shops are plainly determined to extract the last penny from the long-suffering public. As part of the general effort to oust the Millspaugh Mission, the Sa’ed Cabinet, before it fell in August, approved a proposal to set up a Supreme Economic Council to advise the Government on those matters that are at present the responsibility of the mission. More recently the press reported that the Government, this time in agreement with Dr. Millspaugh, were preparing a Bill to modify his powers. In accordance with popular demand, Dr. Millspaugh in July appointed Dr. Black, Chief Administrator of the Cereals and Bread Depart ment, his deputy for economic affairs and Mr. Pixley, of the Treasury-General, his deputy for financial affairs. Mr. Lamb, head of the Price Stabilisation Section, resigned following a serious difference with Dr. Millspaugh and his department has been abolisned. 58. An American, Colonel Harold B. Hoskins, has taken over the post of Chief Representative in Persia of the Middle East Supply Centre and Foreign Economic Administration (?.£., Lend-Lease), and the latter organisation has at I last joined forces completely with the Middle. East Supply Centre. Stocks of the most essential imported commodities, as well indeed of most others, were adequate for the country’s basic needs, and the shortages that occurred were theresult of inefficient distribution or lack of transport facilities. Distribution, Dr. Millspaugh’s main task in recent months, improved slightly, especially as regards pharmaceuticals, but still fell short of what was required. 59. Russian economic penetration is increasing, particularly in the northern provinces. Once again the Soviets are trying to impose an inequitable bargain on the Persian Government in connexion with the purchase of rice in the north. -'Srhe Russians continue to sell cotton piece-goods, sugar (believed to be lend-lease) and other goods on the open market for what they will fetch, and still show no signs of wishing to co-operate with the other Allies on supply matters. Nothing more has been heard from them about the proposal to set up with the Persians a Higher Supply Committee do co-ordinate civil supplies for this country. Cereals and Agricultural Development. 60. The grain situation in the country as a whole was satisfactory at the end of September. Total stocks held on the 22nd September amounted to 109,905 tons, and the grain available in the Tehran Silo constituted sixty-four days’ supply for the capital. The current harvest is generally satisfactory and no shortage of grain is expected during the coming winter. ^ The difficulty of making available a sufficient quantity of seed-wheat for deficit areas of* the Persian Gulf littoral has been partly overcome by the provision of 1,000 tons of seed at reasonable rates by the Government of India. 61. Various projects for the development of agriculture in the country, chiefly by the construction of irrigation works, have been under consideration by the Central Government. Requests for supplies of machinery and other equipment for these projects have led to the deputation by the Middle East Supply Centre of two experts to enquire into the soundness of the schemes and the need for the plant demanded. Such investigaation is very necessary in order to prevent the initiation of projects such as the Hamidiah Farm scheme in Khuzistan which are fundamentally unsound and which have little hope of proving successful. Transport. 62. Railway traffic on the Trans-Iranian Railway was adequate for civil needs in spite of the great volume of aid-to-Russia goods carried northwards. Oil stocks for civil consumption remained adequate throughout the country. Road transport was still precarious and was maintained at its comparatively low level of efficiency only by the unremitting efforts of the Persian Government’s Road Transport Administration, which has a number of American and British staff. Vehicles belonging to the Road Transport Administration are wearing out quicker than they are being replaced, in spite of the arrival so far this year of over 200 new trucks. The arrival and distribution of a large consignment of spare parts has, however, eased the position temporarily. Lack of passenger cars is greatly hampering the work of the administration, but the Government still do not appear to be strong enough to mobilise private cars, which still tour the country in considerable numbers. 63. In this sphere also the Russians are pursuing their own designs regardless of anybody else. Iransovtrans, the Soviet transport agency, are opening up in those parts of the country accessible to them, with the intention of competing for ordinary civil traffic with the Road Transport Administration : this on trucks and tyres supplied under lease-lend for war purposes! / v Oil Concessions. 64. In paragraph 22 (b) of my despatch No. 156 of the 6th April, I mentioned that the Standard Vacuum Company and the Shell Group—backed by the American and British Governments respectively—were competing for oil concessions in Persia. (To them was later added the American Sinclair Com pany.) His Majesty’s Government agreed at an early stage with the United States Government that neither would put pressure on the Persian Govern ment, and His Majesty’s Government instructed this embassy to support the Shell Group but not to go further than was usual on behalf of reputable British interests and not to go further than United States Embassy. Late in June His Majesty’s Government expressed disappointment regarding the delay in reaching a decision and this embassy replied that the situation involved three fundamental points : (a) whether the Persian Government intended to grant a concession before the end of the war; (b) whether on political grounds they14 would prefer to increase the British stake in this country; and (c) what basis for the grant of a concession would be most attractive to them. As to (a), the Persian Government’s difficulty was apprehension as to the attitude of the Russians towards the grant of an oil concession. As to (6), there were conflicting views and it was difficult to judge which would prevail. As to (c), Persian statesmen, always timorous and suspicious, were particularly so in this case, where they felt that in technical matters they were at a disadvantage. They'' Persian Government had stated that they must have the advice of Dr. Millspaugh on the terms offered and Dr. Millspaugh had recom mended the engagement of technical advisers. These technical advisers, Messrs. Hoover and Curtice—who are directors of an American firm which specialises in giving disinterested advice to Governments on the merits of proposed oil concessions—arrived in July. The Persian Government then settled down to examine the various proposals thoroughly in collaboration with a Committee whose numbers the Government—subsequently alarmed by the suspicious reaction of the Majlis towards concession hunting—continually increased in an endeavour to cover themselves from every angle. On the 22nd September the Foreign Office observed to this embassy that the United States Embassy were giving the American companies considerably greater support than the Foreign Office had supposed. It might be doubtful whether this support was to the ultimate advantage of the American companies concerned, but it justified His Majesty’s Government in giving more active support to the Shell Group should prompt and active intervention be required. 65. Meanwhile, however, the whole matter had been put into the melting pot owing to the arrival, a few days earlier, from Moscow, of M. Kavtaradze, an Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs, with the scarifying request that the Persian Government should permit the Soviet Government to prospect for oil for five years in North Persia and then to take up a concession in such areas as they might select. The Persian Government were still considering the matter at the end°of the period under review, with a strong inclination towards post poning the grant of any oil concessions until after the war. Locust Control. 66. Throughout the quarter under review Persia was virtually free of locusts. The hopper campaign during May in Laristan prevented the develop ment of Desert {i.e., migrating) Locust swarms, and apart from one or two small bands which crossed and re-crossed to the Indo-Persian frontier no Desert Locusts entered the country. The final report on the Moroccan {i.e., non-migrating) Locust campaign, which was received in July, states that Persian and Soviet parties in Azerbaijan and Gurgan prevented serious damage to crops, but were unable to forestall widespread egg-laying. The eggs will hatch in spring 1945 and preparations are being made for an extensive campaign with Soviet participation. 67. Judging from Indian reports there is every prospect that no Desert Locust swarms will invade Persia from the east during the coming winter. How ever, the Chief Locust Officer of the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit (who visited Tehran in September) expects a considerable influx of swarms from Africa into Arabia during the autumn of 1944 and preparations will have to be made to protect Persia against invasion from that direction at the beginning of 1945. The extent of possible British assistance has yet to be fixed. 68. Copies of this despatch are going to the Minister-Resident in Cairo, His Majesty’s Ambassador in Moscow, to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia. I have, &amp;c.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 15 6 of the 6t h ApriL I have the honour ^ to convey to you herewith a report on events in Persia during the months of April, May and June 1944. Allied Co-operation in Persia. ^ 2. During their visit to London in April Mr. Stettinius and Sccj&gt;dti~u Mr. Wallace Murray raised the question of Allied co-operation in Persia. It was agreed, on the proposal of Mr. Murray, to suggest to the Soviet Government that face Aa/xv* conversations should be held between the Allied representatives in Tehran to ^ implement more fully the provisions of the Declaration of the Tehran Confer- 7 regarding economic assistance to Persia. The Foreign Office in turn * * 'yj. ence fee IX J 17 'll A &gt;8 / - r* 1 ' 4lCc olao&gt;» ft il Dreign Umce m turn - % /V~ suggested that an agreed plan for the improvement of the Persian forces should 4 be communicated to the Persian authorities by the United States and British Ambassadors in Tehran together with an undertaking to supply the necessary equipment; the Soviet Government should be informed before the offer was made and invited to furnish corresponding information regarding any Soviet proposals to supply arms to Persia. Both the British and American delegations agreed that their aim was to help Persia to be stable, prosperous and secure and that to this end the American advisers should be actively supported. 3. The Soviet Government agreed to take part in the economic discussions proposed by Mr. Murray and the first meeting between the British, Soviet and American representatives was held in Tehran on the 3rd June. The American Charge d’Affaires and His Majesty’s Ambassador suggested to the Soviet Ambassador that the Soviet Embassy should be represented on the new Inter- Allied Higher Supplies Committee (described in the Economic Section of this despatch). The inclusion of representatives of the Soviet Embassy would ensure that co-operation between all four Allies which is essential if the best use is to be made of local and imported supplies and prices are to be kept as low as possible. The Soviet Ambassador asked for time for consideration of this proposal. 4. The second meeting was held on the 21st June. The American Charge d’Affaires and His Majesty’s Ambassador impressed on the Soviet Ambassador that Persia needed economic assistance and that it was in the Soviet’s own ultimate interests, if only as beneficiaries of the Trans-Persia route, to contribute to Persia’s well-being. The American Charge d Affaires and His Majesty’s Ambassador proceeded cautiously with the proposal which had been made by the State Department that the Soviet Ambassador should be pressed to support the American advisers, since the latter are still mistrusted by the Soviet authorities and it was not desirable to endanger the future of the joint economic discussions by bringing up this dangerous matter too brusquely. The meeting then discussed the grain situation and agreed that all possible help must be given by the Allies to ensure the collection of the Persian Government’s share of the °Tain. The Soviet Ambassador, on instructions from Moscow, asked for further information about the proposed Higher Supplies Committee. It was clear that the Soviet Government were afraid that they might be voted down. The American Charge d’Affaires and His Majesty’s Ambassador made it quite clear that the Committee would not vote and would have no executive powers, but would only try to ascertain Persia’s resources and needs and the possibility of meeting these needs from Allied sources. The American Charge d’Affaires and His Majesty’s Ambassador also hinted that any questions which might involve divergence of opinion between the United Kingdom, American and Soviet Governments should be discussed outside the Higher Supplies Committee as far as possible. It is essential that these meetings should not be used by the Persians as an opportunity to arraign the Russians before the British and the Americans. In the course of June, the American Charge d’Affaires communicated to the Soviet Ambassador [56—24] B / L T. 1 Ga ta scheme by the American Director of Road Transport for the management of road transport in the north. The Soviet Ambassador promised to study this, but he was guarded and tended to throw doubt on the need for Americans. Never theless, the local Russian authorities show signs of departing from their complete obstruction of the activities of the Millspaugh Mission in their zone. They seem more disposed in fact to co-operate with the local American transport representatives, notwithstanding the unforthcoming reception given by the Soviet v Ambassador to the American Charge d’Aft'aires’ approach. Again, che American at last admitted to Azerbaijan for grain collection seems to have been left a free hand by the Russians. It is true that they remain aloof from the work of local collection but they have offered to help with the long-distance haulage of grain southwards. Yet again, the American Director of Finance in Meshed, for whom the Russians have given a delayed and grudging residence permit, reports good co-operation by the local Russian authorities. 5. On the other hand, the examination by the Soviet section of the Tripartite Censorship of Persia of British and American books and periodicals has recently exceeded all bounds, and the British section have found torn wrappers addressed to His Majesty’s Embassy, the American Embassy, other diplomatic missions of countries in relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Dr. Millspaugh and various Persian Government departments. The British section of the Censorship, in consultation with His Majesty's Embassy and Censorship, Middle East, have taken up the matter strongly and the Soviet section have promised, subject to approval by higher authority, not to interefere with books and periodicals addressed to bodies such as those described above or to British and American nationals. An opportunity has been taken of examining the publica tions recently condemned, and while a few condemnations are clearly reasonable, the majority can be described as frivolous. The Soviet censors are in future to be required to show cause why a book should not be delivered to the addressee, and when they cannot be persuaded to withdraw their objections, the book will be returned to the sender. The whole question is still under active consideration by the British authorities concerned. 6. Finally, Soviet obstructionism reached its climax at the end of June when the Soviet authorities, in spite of strong pressure by His Majesty’s Embassy, delayed to grant permission for Sir Olaf Caroe and Sir Denys Pilditch to fly to Meshed (where the Government of India have large interests) until the visitors had left on their return journey to India. (Their visit to Persia is described in the Indian Section of this despatch.) 7. However, the foregoing paragraphs, generally speaking, give an unduly gloomy view of Anglo-American-Soviet relations in this country. Persia is the one country where British, American and Soviet military and civil authorities meet on a broad land front, and the many day-to-day contacts proceed smoothly, or at any rate smoothly enough for the despatch of business. Relations with India. 8. The Persian Cultural Mission which travelled to India in February returned to Persia in April. They professed to have been delighted at their reception both in official and non-official circles and greatly impressed by what they saw. In particular, they were impressed by the enormous number of valuable Persian manuscripts in India—exceeding anything to be found in Persia itself; by university, school and public buildings; by 'the vast progress made in industry; by the fact that the majority of ministers are Indians and that British and Indian officials work side by side, sometimes one being senior and sometimes the other; and by the high morale of the Indian people as a whole in the face of the | Axis Powers. Most of these points may seem obvious, but they are not obvious to the Persians, who like to regard the Indians as a nation of helots trodden down by the British, and the mission has undoubtedly had a beneficial effect, particularly as its members have been emphasising these points in speeches and broadcasts since their return. 9. Four members of the Indian Defence Consultative Committee travelled to Persia in May to visit the Indian troops here. 10. Sir' Olaf Caroe, Secretary to the External Affaire Department of the Government of India, and Sir Denys Pilditch, Director of Intelligence of the Home Department of the Government of India, arrived in Persia on the 27th June to stay at His Majesty’s Embassy and discuss problems of mutual interest. They were also entertained by the Persian Government. They left on the 2nd July.4 the Persian Government. The note reminded the Persian Governmment that the United States Government only assented to the engagement of Dr. Millspaugh and his assistants because the Persian Government insisted and undertook to support them. The object was not to provide a political buffer but to afford economic assistance. The note added that harmony was essential and if the Persian Government did not want assistance the United States Government did not intend to press it upon them. The Persian Government in their reply declared (quite falsely)^ that they had given full support to Dr. Millspaugh. On the 22nd June the Prime Minister brought before the Majlis a Bill providing for the repeal of the law which gave Dr. Millspaugh his powers and providing for the transfer of these powers to the Ministry of Finance and other Ministries. The next day Dr. Millspaugh tended his resignation. At the same time the Road Transport Department, which owing to the failure of the Persian Govern ment to appoint a Persian president now consists of British and Americans only, decided that until the situation cleared, a consignment of about one hundred Lease-Lend lorries which had arrived for the Persian Government should not be issued (there was justification in this in that the Persian Government have paid for very little of. the Lend-Lease material received, and that if Dr. Millspaugh went, the Americans who are running road transport for the Persian Government with some success would leave with him). The Persian Government were severely shaken by this and by the prospect of incurring the serious displeasure of the United States Government, and at the end of the period under review it was virtually certain that the difference between Dr. Millspaugh and the Persian Government would be composed. 17. It need hardly be said that His Majesty’s Embassy have given Dr. Millspaugh their full support and would regard his departure as a calamity, in spite of his faults (which would prevent his receiving our full support if he was a British subject). Soviet Interests. 18. The new Soviet Ambassador, M. Constantin Mikhailov, who had presented his credentials in January, left Persia in May ostensibly for medical treatment and has not returned. There is ground for suspicion that his departure was not due to illness alone. The Persian Prime Minister saw the Ambassador the day after the Persian Government had refused to accept the conditions attached to the offer of war material made by Stalin to the Shah at the Tehran Conference, and he found the Ambassador “ looking like a man condemned to death,” yet maintaining that he was perfectly well. From that moment the Ambassador was never seen again except presumably by Russians, and it seems likely that he had fallen into disgrace for failing to complete a transaction initiated by Marshal Stalin himself. Neither the British nor the American Embassies regret his departure. He was cold and suspicious, and they failed to get a word out of him either for or against anything they said. M. Mikhailov has been succeeded by the former charge d’affaires, M. Maximov, who is an old Persian hand and a clever intriguer, but is human, has a sense of humour, and can often be teased into taking action. The change therefore is for the better. 19. The Persian Society for Cultural Relations with the Soviet Union has issued some impressive statues, but so far little appears to have been done to implement the programme laid down in them, and the sole activity has been to organise classes for learning Russian; about ninety persons have been enrolled so far. It is too early to estimate what response the Persian public will give to the new society once it has begun to function properly. In Isfahan Russian is being taught to Armenian schoolchildren. Polish Interests. 20. At the opening of the period under review there were about 8,200 Polish refugees in Persia. Since then some 300 boys and girls have been incor porated into the Polish army in the Middle East as enlisted bo}^ and P.S.K. (= A.T.S.), and about 1,100 have left for India and other destinations overseas. There are thus about 6,800 at the present time, and this number should be reduced by about 1,000 in the course of the next few days by the departure of another group for India. 21. Of the 5,800 odd then remaining, about 2,000 will be in Isfahan, 2,800 in Tehran, and 1,000 in the transit camp at Ahwaz. 22. The period has been generally devoid of incident, and the health of the refugees has been satisfactory. The arrival from Soviet Russia of a mission of Poles masquerading as Polish Patriots does not appear to have had any influence on the Polish community.5 2‘3. It should be noticed also that the problem of Polish refugees in Persia has assumed a different aspect in the last few months. In the past it was a matter of putting pressure on the shipping authorities to provide transports to get the refugees away, and it was their inability to provide enough shipping owing to operations and other causes that has made the evacuation drag on the unconscion able time it has. Now, however, practically all the refugees who are not in some ^/ay employed here, or are the relations of employees, have left; so under existing conditions only one more transport—referred to above—can be filled. Those remaining will then be either the employees of British and American civil and military organisations, and their dependants (whom it has been decided not to move for the time being), the various Polish staffs, and the children’s school at Isfahan. This last can only be moved when some place overseas can be found where it can be received in its entirety or in perhaps two halves. The view has been generally taken that this institution is doing such good work in forming a new generation of Poles that it would be a pity to break it up. Anylo-Persian Public Relations. 24. The reopening of the second front in Western Europe made a profound impression on Persian public opinion. The importance and significance of this event was pressed home through the various propaganda channels followed by the Public Relations Bureau and steps were taken at the same time to curb the wave of undue optimism regarding the early cessation of hostilities which swept the country. 25. The vernacular press continued on the whole to be friendly, and Allied successes on the various fronts were reported favourably. In general, however, the main preoccupation of the press centred round the internal troubles of the country and the need for Persia to prepare plans for arguing her case at the peace conference. 26. On the occasion of “ United Nations Day ” on the 14th June, a special celebration was arranged at “Victory House.’' The reception, which was attended by members of the Persian Cabinet and Government and representatives of the Diplomatic Corps, concluded with a showing of the film “ The Gentle Sex,' depicting the part played by girls of the A.T.S. 27. During the period under review the various activities of the Public Relations Bureau were examined in detail with a view to deciding the lines along which propaganda policy in Persia should be directed in the future in order to meet the change in the war situation and the need for long-term plans for the post-war period. British Council Activities. 28. General. —Professor Boase, the Middle East representative of the British Council, arrived in May and stayed a month in Persia inspecting the Council’s work. He lectured at the Tehran University and at the institutes in Tehran and Isfahan, and broadcasted from the Tehran State radio. It has been decided to open a new institute in Shiraz and a director has been sent there to make the necessary prepamtions, but an assistant will not be available till September. 40,000 English textbooks have been ordered by the Ministry of Education for use in the schools throughout Persia : they are on their way from London. 30,000 text books for adults have been ordered from Cairo for sale to the public. The broadcasting of English lessons on five evenings a week was started in April, for which 5 ; 000 textbooks were specially written by a member of the Council staff and printed locally : these were distributed to the shops in Tehran and the provinces and sold immediately. The first two numbers of “ Ahang,” a bilingual quarterly published by the Ministry of Informat ion in 7 V Delhi with the co-operation of the Council, were received here'and all copies were sold without delay. The Tehran Medical Association continued their regular fortnightly clinical meetings and held a successful reception at the Tehran Institute. There are now about 200 members of different nationalities. As the showing of educational films to the University, schools and colleges of all kinds had grown too large for the Council to handle with their limited staff and equip ment, it was decided to leave all film work to the Public Relations Bureau in Tehran until the Council can take it over themselves. At the request of the chancellor of the university 1,500 copies of a lecture by the British Ambassador (•n “ Dr. Johnson ” were printed in English and Persian for distribution to the university and schools. 29. Anqlo-Persian Institutes. —The institutes in Tehran and Isfahan and a branch in Tehran are now teaching over 1,500 adult students of both sexes and6 assist in the teaching of 500 in the university, schools and other institutions, further expansion ot English classes is limited by the number of teachers, although they are helped by all.the available part-time teachers from the British ami American communities. In Shemran, a summer resort near Tehran, the Summer Institute was opened in June with 200 students. At Isfahan factory owners have been approached to form workers’ clubs in which English classes will be organised. The weekly concerts, film shows and lectures continued as^ usual, although lecturers are becoming increasingly hard to find. An exhibition oy tne Isfahan Arts Group, of work both traditional and modern, was viewed by 2.500 visitors at the Isfahan Institute. British Army Interests. 30. The Indian Army Motor Transport Companies, who for some eighteen months had maintained a high record of efficiency in carrying “ Aid to Russia ” supplies, often in very arduous conditions of road and winter weather, from Khanakm, on the Iraq frontier, to Tabriz, have now been withdrawn. The opeiation of that route was taken over by the United Kingdom Commercial Coipoiation, but the Russians have now elected that with effect from the 1st August the United Kingdom Commercjal Corporation shall carry to Pahlevi only and not to Tabriz. The maintenance of the Takistan-Tabriz road, for long the responsibility of British engineers, has now been handed over to the Russian authorities, and the new Mianeh Bridge, the last work to be completed by the Royal Engineers on that road, was recently' opened for traffic. The connexion Army ^ith Azerbaijan appears now to have come to an end, and the Russians may perhaps be congratulating themselves that British ofhcials’have no further justification for penetrating that part of their zone in Persia except on business connected with the Consulate-General in Tabriz. 31 Thefts of British Army telephone and telegraph wires recently reached S i? C Ti proportions that it seemed necessary to address a sharp note to the Persian Government which has led to the assumption by the Persian Army of responsibility for the protection of certain sectors. Pilfering from trains and dumps still continues in spite of stern measures taken to check it. The value of wire and of the goods that can be pilfered is so high that thieves willindv risk death to obtain this valuable loot. &amp; J Security. •u A ft / r farther prolonged negotiations, the surrender by the Qashgai tube or the four Germans whom they had been harbouring was followed by the surrender to the British security authorities of the Persian Deputy, Naubakht m the month of May. Naubakht had fled from Tehran and taken sanctuary with the Qashcpi in August 1943, after His Majesty’s Embassy had informed the Persian Government that they had documents showing that he was one of the chief instigators of the anti-Ally plot of 1942. Naubakht has been sent to the rnternment camp at Sultanabad for interrogation by the Anglo-Persian Commission. 33. !n June the British security authorities located the Mullah Kashani in a^villa in the hills north of Tehran, and effected his arrest in collaboration with the Persian police. Kashani was also implicated in the anti-Ally plot mentioned above Kashani, too, has been sent to Sultanabad for interrogation It is probable that there are now no more prominent Persians at large in Persia whose intern- ment is required by the British security authorities, but some have escaped to 1 urkey and beyond with the connivance of Persian officials. Internal Politics and Majlis. t t , 34 ' °, n th ® 6th A P ri ! th e Prime Minister, Saed, presented to the Shah and to the Majhs his reconstituted Cabinet. The two young men, Mahmud Fateh ami Mahmud Nariman, were dropped, and also General Riazi; Abdul-Qasim Ferouhar became Minister of Finance, Dr. Ghani Minister of Education in place o Kiazi, Nasir E timadi became Minister of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Rosts and Telegraphs remained vacant, the Under-Secretary, Hakimi, being considered quite capable of carrying on as he had done on many occasions before , l , p . r u f bllC P 31 ^ 1 ? was given to Dr. Saed Malik, who had not previously .eld Cabinet rank. The Cabinet did not appear to be much stronger than its predecessor, and could not be regarded as including any true representative of the young and progressive elements, except possibly Hajhir. He. however, seems at the moment of writing to be estranged from his chief to some extent. Perhaps7 it is impossible in this intriguing country to appoint young Ministers because such appointments raise storms of jealousy and hostility from all the disappointed young men. The Cabinet was not greeted with any enthusiasm either in the Majlis or in the country, and since its inception everyone, even its members, seem to agree that the Government has no authority or force. Before the end of April Dr. Ghani had resigned, and his place was not filled by the end of June, r Tahid, the Under-Secretary, acting for him. Nevertheless the Majlis gave the new Cabinet a vote of confidence on the 16th April. Saed has let it be known that if his Cabinet was rejected this time he would resign; but perhaps the Majlis vote was due not so much to that fact as to the absence of any obvious alternative to Saed. 36. During the following three months the vigorous personality of Seyyid Zia has caused some stir. He has kept aloof from the Shah and is evidently on the worst possible terms with His Majesty, whom he accuses of aiding his principal critics, the Tudeh party. His newspapers, the chief of which is Fa'd i Imruz, edited by the unstable firebrand, Mazaffar Firouz, have carried on a ceaseless polemic against the Tudeh party, who have replied in the same vein. Supported by wealthy friends, Seyyid Zia has obtained large premises in Tehran for his party, which is as yet nameless and, indeed, programmeless. He has also been angling for support from the tribes, on the grounds that they are a virile element who must be conciliated and brought into willing submission to the Persian Government after the settlement of their just grievances. He has also gained the support of some officers in the army, including Razmara, the Chief of the Staff. He is in favour of a limitation of the Shah’s powers and a revision of the Constitution on that point, with a view to a more strict assertion of the limits of the powers of the Monarch. Seyyid Zia’s greatest difficulty lies in the determined hostility of the Russians, who cannot get out of their heads the theory that Seyyid Zia is a creature of the British. Seyyid Zia seems obstinate, and to judge from some of his supporters is a poor judge of men; but he is a power to be reckoned with and it is unfortunate that the opposition of the Shah and the Russians has caused the Shah to take in this matter the same side as the Russians, a course which is bad for the Shah and might be dangerous for the stability of the country. 37. One of the features of the political life of Persia during the last three months has been the rise of several labour unions throughout the country. Such unions have existed for some time in the Russian-occupied zone, where they are affiliated with the Tudeh party; and similar unions exist in Isfahan, in Tehran, amongst railway workers, and in Khuzistan. In Isfahan the power of the Tudeh and the Workers Union combined caused alarm to the Government, who sent down a new Governor-General, Reza Afshar, to deal with the situation. The Tudeh party, backed in many ways by the Russians, has remained the one strong paity m the country. Other parties exist, but hardly more than in name - the much advertised “ Hamrahan,” the creation of Mustafa Fateh, has already disintegrated. The various “fractions” in the Majlis continued to exist and to function, but they were more like associations of friends.than political parties. S £ ^ e . fraction is composed of eleven members, all from Khorassan. The “Mihan ' fraction consists of the friends of Dr. Taheri of Yezd. to the number of nineteen; the Democrats were started by the egregious Farrukh and comprised nineteen members till they absorbed the Azerbaijan non-Tudeh Deputies when these v ere elected at the end of May and changed their name to • ^ . Liberty, thus reaching a membership of thirty. The other fraction is the Ittihad i Milli, with thirteen members. A few Deputies remain unattached, and the President of the Majlis, Seyyid Muhammad Sadegh labatabai has been endeavouring, hitherto without much success, to combine them and found by their support a central party of Liberal views. 38. Early in May the Prime Minister asserted himself sufficiently to deliver a^ sensible and salutary lecture to journalists concerning their duties towards the public, it appeared that his admonitions had some slight effect, for a short time, on their irresponsible virulence and shameless blackmail. Nevertheless the newspaper Demavand published a personal attack on a member of the Embassy but was not suspended as a result. • -iv/r^ also dropped a bomb-shell into the Majlis by introducing early m May, a Bill proposing that the officials of all Ministries should, for the period or the war, be considered to have the same liabilities as officers and soldiers called to the colours; that factories, whether Government-owned or private and their workmen should similarly be considered to have been mobilised for national service, and that restrictions should be imposed on the place of residence of8 persons acting against the war-time interests of Persia or her Allies or committing breaches of the peace. This Bill was not passed by the end of the quarter. The Bill was attacked by the Tudeh press as reactionary, and it was suggested in some papers that the Minister of the Interior, who as Minister of Communica tions had paid a long visit to London, had drafted this Bill under British inspiration. _ 40. The new Governor-General of Isfahan was the cause of an interpellation by the Deputy Farivar on the 17th May. Farivar’s argument was based on the fact that Afshar had been tried and condemned for fraud in the time of Reza Shah, and had been deprived permanently of the right to hold a Government post. The Government survived the interpellation, as the Prime Minister gave as his reply the reason that Afshar was a strong Governor who appeared the most suitable man available for the task of restoring order in Isfahan—a task which he had accomplished—and that legal opinion, which the Prime Minister had taken, was against the argument of the interpellator on the point of deprivation from the right of entering Government service. However, the Prime Minister promised to submit the question to the High Court of Appeal; and when this promise was fulfilled the court decided against Afshar, and he had to be recalled. 41. The elections in Azerbaijan Province were practically finished before the end of the quarter. Two Communist Deputies, Ipekjian and Pishavari, secured election with Soviet support at Tabriz, and the Armenian Deputy for the North, Ardashez Hovanessiantz, is a well-known Communist who was imprisoned as such for many years under Reza Shah. The election at Ardebil also resulted in a victory for a creature of the Russians, Sheikh Hussein Lankurani; in this case the intervention of the Russians in the conduct of the elections was unusually open. The elections in Fars have also been finished, except for Abadeh and Firuzabad. For Shiraz town the candidates who were agreed to by Qawam-ul-Mulk were successful, while the Qashgais were not. At Jahrum also a local man, Hazaqi, was successful, and at La Azadi, the previous member defeated his rival Faramarzi. Whether Nasir Qashgai will now stand for the Majlis is doubtful; his natural constituency would be Firuzabad; he might also stand for Abadeh. But the fact that he did not visit the Shah during his trip to the south was not a good augury for the submission to the Persian Government which w’e hoped he would make. 42. Anti-Bahai riots were reported in June at Abadeh, Hamadan and Senneh. A marked wave of anti-Bahai feeling seems to have begun, though the reasons for it are obscure. Certain mullas are known to have expressed surprise that the Shah when at Shiraz visited the Bahai Deputy Dehqan, and the credentials of the latter were opposed in the Majlis on account of his religion. 43. The Shah had shown little sign of fulfilling the promise he is known to have made of keeping clear of politics; for instance, he seems to have sent his Minister of Court to reprove the Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Justice for receiving British visitors on matters of departmental business; a step which brings back unpleasant memories of the foolish and irritating restrictions under which all diplomats in Persia had to work in the latter years of Reza Shah’s reign. 44. Several new newspapers appeared during the quarter, one of which, named Darya, uttered the purest of pure Marxian doctrines, though these were explained by M. Maximov, the Soviet Ambassador, as being the work of a crypto- Fascist. The rest of the papers were for the most part scurrilous and ephemeral publications, full of sound and fury, but signifying hardly more than that the Shah, who subsidised a lot of them, did not like Seyyid Zia. Tribal Situation. 45. The tribes have recently come in for some attention in the political arena in Tehran. Seyyid Zia, with the object of gaining tribal support, made known his sympathy with the tribes for the neglect and oppression they had suffered in recent years and his view that they merited much greater consideration from the Government and that they should' be allowed to retain their arms to protect themselves against oppression until they were assured of just adminis tration. This put the Tudeh party, always in opposition to Seyyid Zia, into a difficult position. They had themselves for political purposes been championing the cause of the tribes, but their hostility to Seyyid Zia obliged them to cry loudly against what they alleged was incitement of the tribes to rearm and oppose the Government. The Shah, too, was disturbed by the thought that Seyyid Zia was trying to secure the support of the tribes with a view to using them to bring off a coup d'Etat as the Bakhtiari had done in 1909. For a time it seemed9 that he was himself going to make a bid for popularity among the tribes, but he seems to have reverted to his father’s idea that they must be disarmed as soon and as ruthlessly as possible and kept in a state of weakness lest they become a dangerous instrument in the hands of foreigners or schemers against the throne. 46. The Government, perhaps as the result of nearly three years’ persuasion by this embassy, has also condescended to recognise that among the people of Persia for whose welfare they are responsible are tribal communities—outlandish 'barbarians in the opinion of most of the Ministers—whose conditions of life require special consideration. A tribal commission has been formed, composed of the two Ministers without portfolio and two tribal Deputies, one a Bakhtiari and one a Kurd. This commission has recommended the formation in the Ministry of Interior of a tribal department which would be represented in the provinces by committees for tribal affairs under the supervision of Governors- General and Governors. Plans for the formation of this department with its subsidiary committees are now being drawn up in conferences between representa tives of the Ministries of the Interior and War. The Chief of the Staff has advocated the assembly in Tehran of a commission to be composed of representatives of the Ministries that would be concerned with projects for the improvement of conditions in tribal areas—Agriculture, Public Health, Education—and delegates from the principal tribes, to make recommendations to the Government regarding the policy to be followed in tribal territory. The decisions of the Government, he proposes, should be implemented in the provinces by similar commissions assembled from time to time as required. The proposal that the tribes should be allowed to speak for themselves may be too revolutionary for a democratic Persian Government, but the attitude of the Chief of the Staff, if sincere, gives reason for faint hope that the Persian army may, if it should ever become bold enough to fight the tribes again, act with greater moderation than it did in Reza Shah’s day. 47. It is unlikely that the tribes have interpreted the light that has shined on them in Tehran as the dawning of a new day in their relations with the Central Government. Only actions over a considerable period will convince them that conciliatory actions by Government officials are more than a trick to keep them quiet while the Government is weak. For the time being they are, with a few exceptions, being unusually orderly. 48. With the surrender by the Qashgai of the Germans in March and of Naubakht in May it became politic for British officials to show a less sceptical face to the protestations of friendship of Nasir Qashgai and his brothers. Nasir made more appropriate advances than he has yet done by visiting Shiraz and calling on the acting Governor-General and His Majesty’s Consul, to whom he gave fervent assurances of his desire to act in accordance with British wishes. It suits him for the present to demonstrate his power for good in Ears by using his influence to restrain the lawless inclinations of the Qashgai tribes; and their behaviour during the spring migration and subsequently has been unusually good. But Nasir’s change of heart did not extend so far as to induce him to pav homage to his Sovereign during the latter’s visit to Shiraz in May. On hearing that it was impending, Nasir retired to his mountains. He had offered to call on the Shah if His Majesty’s Embassy would give him a safe-conduct, but this, for obvious reasons was refused. 49. A development that should lead to greater stability in Ears is an agreement between Qavam-ul-Mulk on the one hand and Nasir* Qashgai and his brothers on the other to the effect that in future they will co-operate with rather than oppose each other in Ears. The Qavam has made his co-operation dependent on two conditions : that no action should be taken injurious to the general interests of Ears and of Persia; that no action shall be taken against British interests or British wishes. The motives behind this reconciliation are, in the first place, the Qavam s conviction that he cannot rely on the Government to protect against the Qashgai such interests as he and his family still have left in I ars: in the second place, the fear common to all men of property in Persia of a Russian-sponsored revolution in the north and the resulting desire to create some stability in the still feudal south that might be developed into some form of local autonomy; and, in the third place, the hope of being able to present a united front against a possible return of a tyrannical dictatorship of the Crown and the army. 50. In Bakhtiari assiduous attempts were made by all Morteza Quli’s jealous relatives among the khans to aggravate the grounds of complaint, unimportant in themselves, against his rather autocratic rule. In spite of this [56-24] c10 the situation remained satisfactorily quiet, and Morteza Quli Khan appears to be well in control of the tribe. The embassy reminded the disgruntled khans that they had themselves unanimously indicated Morteza Quli Khan as the most suitable among them to govern the tribe and advised them that their attemps to discredit him now were not likely to encourage the Government to make further experiments in appointing a Bakhtiari khan to an important post nor the embassy to approve such an appointment. The khans seem to be taking this advice to heart and to be trying to come to agreement among themselves. But as the cause of their discontent is that Morteza Quli Khan has not allowed them opportunities of extracting money from Bakhtiari and as greed is an ineradicable quality in the khans of the older generation that has led for years to familv quarrels, concord among them is not likely to be of long duration. 51. On the borders of the northern oil-field area in Khuzistan the Bahmai tribe of Kuhgalu has been indulging in some minor raiding. Earlier in the year plans had been made by the local Persian commanders for the disarmament of this tribe and the western Janeki tribe, hut at the last moment fears that the Bahmai might be supported by other Kuhgalu tribes modified the plan, and only the Janeki lost some arms. It is through their territory that the Bahmai are now raiding, and the Janeki plead their disarmament as justification for bein^ unable to prevent them. . ° 52. 1 he Arabs ot Khuzistan have for some time been giving cause for anxious thought. They have recently acquired many arms, and, in spite of the fact that large numbers of them are employed at good rates of pav by the Allied forces, they have been unable to refrain from smuggling, thieving on a laro-e scale and brigandage. The local Persian authorities have for long been urging the necessity of operations for their disarmament, and it is indeed evident that the establishment of order and the restoration of their authority is likely to be a very serious problem for the Persian Government when Allied troops are with drawn and the steadying influence of large-scale employment is removed. The satisfactory solution of the problem is obviously of considerable importance to 1 ^ Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. In the interests of the future it is desirable that the Persian Government should now be allowed and encouraged to assert their authority, to establish control of the frontier and take active measures to slippress brigandage. But immediate Allied military interests demand that the Persian authorities should be restrained from taking action against the Arabs that might disturb the labour employed by the Allied forces. The Arabs have not been slow to take advantage of this situation, and brigandage in the Ahu I)asht area, where are situated some of the lands being developed by the Khuzistan Agricultural Society, had become so bad, Colonel Noel the director of the society, having been himself attacked and robbed, that the Persian authorities were allowed to take punitive action with strictly limited objectives which is still in progress. J Persian Land Forces. 53.—(1) Army. At the beginning of this year the higher direction of the army was in the hands of a number of officers, headed by General Ahmadi as Minister for War, who were firmly of the opinion that the best safeguards for the interests of Persia and themselves lay in close co-operation with the British authorities and the American advisers. The dangers to those interests they saw m the internal disorder of the country and in the opportunity that that gave tor the furtherance of what they were convinced were Russian designs against Persia s independence. It was consequently perhaps not surprising that thev were not well regarded by the Russians. On the other hand, thev were a disappointment to the Shah, who had certainly hoped that their obvious good will towards the British would induce the latter to provide some assistance in the re-equipment of his army. Consequently when Stalin made his offer of tanks and aircraft to which it is believed he attached the condition that changes should be niade in the higher direction of the army, the Shah, on one pretext or another gradually removed the more important of these officers and in April appointed as Cniet of the General Staff the Russian choice, General Razmara. 54 This officer, since his resignation from the same post in August 1943 m a fit of angry resentment against the British, had succeeded in ingratiating himself with the Russians. It may, however, be assumed that Razmara curried favour with the Russians solely to serve his own ends. He is primarily ambitious for himself and then in less degree patriotic, strongly nationalist and anti-foreign He is capable and energetic and has made an extensive study of conditions in his own country. In his heart he is hostile to us, but at present finds it good policy11 to conceal that hostility and to make a show of a genuine desire to co-operate with a view to giving us as little excuse as possible for interfering in internal affairs. He is fundamentally opposed to the American Advisory Mission, believing that he and his friends are better able to devise a military organisation suitable to Persia than are American officers, but he tolerates them while they are the means of procuring equipment from America and is at present lavish ^ in assurances to them of co-operation. 55. The American military advisers, who have now reached their full com plement of twenty, have unfortunately not succeeded in gaining the confidence or support of any considerable number of Persian officers. By their presence they have undoubtedly restricted the grosser abuses and corruption and may even have helped towards 'the establishment of the beginnings of an ideal of honesty. In that they can certainly claim to have rendered service to Persia. But the prospect of fundamental and lasting reforms in the Persian forces being achieved through their endeavours grows less as the end of the war grows nearer and with it the expectation of unlimited quantities of arms being available to the Shah and his army. 56. The Shah, although less obviously interfering in the affairs of the army, still looks forward to the day when, Allied troops and American advisers having gone, he will, as Commander-in-chief in fact, rule this country as his father did. But it is already being said that he is beginning to distrust his restlessly ambitious and intriguing Chiet of Staff, and the usual dissensions have begun to reappear between the General Staff and the Ministry for War. 57. All plans for the army for the current year, whether American or Persian, are at a standstill owing to lack of funds. Dr. Millspaugh, in the budget which he recently laid before Parliament, has allotted only 100 million torimns against the 153 millions estimated to be necessary for the organisation approved b&gt; General Ridley. If the 100 millions is not increased the size of the army will have to be reduced, a measure which is likely to be strongly opposed by the Shah, or the underpaid officer will have to be allowed to prey on the people as he has done before. 58. Stalin s tanks and aircraft have never materialised. The conditions subsequently attached to the offer stipulated that the units of mixed Russian and Persian personnel which were to be formed for the purpose of training in these arms were to be under the command of Soviet officers, who were themselves to be under the command of the Red Army; that the Persian personnel were to be selected with the approval of the Russian commander, and that the units were not to be removed from their appointed places of training—Meshed and Kazvin nor could the material be used for any other purpose without the approval of the Red Army. I hese conditions were too full of alarming possibilities to be accept able to the Persian Government. 59. —(2) Gendarmerie .—In the gendarmerie, as in the army, plans for improvement are held up by lack of funds. The credit demanded bv Colonel Schwarzkopf foi the modified organisation he had in view for the current year that is, eighteen regiments of gendarmerie with a total strength of 28,000—the number he considers to be really necessary is 40,000—amounted to 60 million tomans. The amount allotted in the budget by Dr. Millspaugh is 29 million tomans, which is the bare cost of ten regiments at the increased rates of pav which are in fact the minimum at which officers and men can be expected to refram from partnership with brigands and thieves. Even among gendarmerie officers the opinion is forming that in the present financial and economic situation ot the country the interests of internal security would be better served by devotin° the available resources to the army and the police. Colonel Schwarzkopf’s insistence that the gendarmerie should be independent of the army has accentuated the lack of co-operation that became immediately evident when' the force passed from the control of the Ministry for War to that of the Interior. Schwarzkopf ’s mission has now been completed to the maximum strength of six officers sanctioned by the United States. Although Colonel Schwarzkopf has extensive powers, it is obivous that six officers can exercise no very effective influence over the actions of personnel scattered in small packets over an area of 628,000 square miles, and consequently in the provinces the gendarmerie shows no improvement as the result of Colonel Schwarzkopf's eighteen months hard work. 1 6 1-—(3) Police. There is as yet no indication that the Persian Government intend to ask for an American adviser to replace Mr. Timmerman, who died in May. Indeed, their experience of Mr. Timmerman is not likely to encourage them to do so. In spite of his record as an efficient police officer in the United [56-24] c 212 States, the problem of the Persian police was far beyond his capacity. Indeed, it is beyond the capacity of any one single foreign adviser. 62. The police, like the other security forces, is now faced with a cut in its budget demands which will necessitate either the cancellation of the inadequate increases of pay recently granted or a reduction in numbers that will remove all chances of the force being able to perform the duties required of it. Persian A ir Force. 63. The fifteen Anson aircraft for the Persian Air Force are in course of - delivery and erection in the Middle East, whither a party of ten pilots and five technical officers and men are shortly proceeding to be taught how to fly and main tain them. The Persians have not been able to nominate a suitable officer for the summer course at the Middle East Staff College. 64. The Persians have now taken over the repair and maintenance of their aircraft which was previously done, under agreement, by the Royal Air Force at Doshan Tappeh. They are being assisted in this and in their general organisation by Royal Air Force personnel. 65. Efforts are being made by the Persians to establish a rudimentary meteorological service. The Persian meteorological officers have returned after attempting, with partial success, to follow a course in Middle East. 66. Sarlashkar Hussein Firouz is relinquishing the command of the air ; force on appointment as Governor-General and Officer Commanding Troops in ; Fars. His successor-designate is Sarlashkar Ahmad Nakhchevan, who is said to be accepting the post with reluctance under pressure from the Shah. Nakhchevan was largely responsible for building up the air force, which he virtually ran from 1927-36. Since he was Minister of War in 1941-42, he has held no active com mand and shown more interest in cards than aircraft. He is unlikely to infuse much discipline or energy into the air force, which sadly needs both. Civil Air Lines. 67. The Persian State Airline has asked and obtained leave to use Mehrabad airfield as its terminal. This airfield is used by British Overseas Airways, and the arrangement should serve, together with the shortly expected delivery of three de Havilland aircraft of the Rapide type, to maintain British influence in IjPersian air communications. Meanwhile, an experimental service to Isfahan, Shiraz and Bushire has been started with a light aircraft of the Flying Club. 68. The Russians, apparently without previous notice to the Persian Government, have started air services with Douglas C. 47’s between Tehran and Meshed, Tabriz and Resht. These are professedly official in character but are much used and appreciated by Persians on a commercial basis as the aircraft are comfortable and the fares moderate. The present frequency is about twice weekly to Meshed and once a week on the other services. This may be increased. Finance. 69. During the last few weeks the outturn for the financial year 1322 (ending on the 20th March, 1944) has been published. The deficit on the ordinary and commercial budgets taken together is 1.372 million rials (as compared with 753 million for the year 1321), which is not far from the deficit of 1,058 million originally estimated. The commercial budget is responsible for 933 million of the total deficit. 70. The budget for the year 1323 is shortly coming under discussion by the Majlis. It shows ordinary revenue as 3,958 million rials against estimated expenditure of 4,569; while in the commercial budget revenue is placed at 6.367 million and expenditure at 5,735. The surplus is 470.391 rials. How far this estimate is accurate will depend largely on the extent to which the Administrator- General of the Finances, Dr. Millspaugh, will be able to carry out his intention of turning over part of the Government industrial undertakings to private enter prise and reforming the management of the remainder. In general his task should be less difficult than it was a year or even six months ago. It is true that prices are still rising, the cost of living index in Tehran, which was 1,082 in February, having been 1,083 in March, 1,167 in April and 1,201 in May. Over the last seven or eight months, however, the increase in the price indices has been much less steep than formerly, and there are signs that a certain stabilisation of prices may be reached and maintained within a reasonable period and the figures may then Uirn downward, provided that the Millspaugh Mission remains without serious curtailment of its powers. The improved distribution of food and other goods, promised by Dr. Millspaugh, will assist in improving the situation. Favourable war news has also already had some effect in decreasing prices.13 ( 71. The note circulation is still on the increase; it was 5,701 million rials in February, 6,056 in March, 6,119 in April, 6,222 in May and 6.261 million in June. 72. The Persian Government was represented by a small delegation headed by M. Ibtehaj, the Governor of the National Bank, at the Middle East Financial Conference held in Cairo during April, and it was a party to all the resolutions ^ passed. Some of them would admittedly be difficult to apply in Persia; but it is certain that Dr. Millspaugh, who already knows well the measures required to restore the Persian economy, will continue to press the Government to adopt those measures as and when possible. In this pressure he is assisted by His Majesty’s Embassy. He is in particular considering additional direct taxation, partly because owing to governmental delays the increased rates of income tax will not for the present produce the full revenue required. 73. The Millspaugh Mission is also undertaking a survey of post-war problems—among them budgetary, fiscal and banking matters; trade and tariff policy; agriculture and industry; public works and unemployment; and general economic planning. This survey is being carried out by a number of committees • each made up of Persian officials and members of the mission together with Persian merchants and others of standing in cases in which they will be of assistance. 74. Sales of gold on His Majesty’s Government’s account have continued during the last three months, although it is impossible to provide any exact figure to show their effect in combating inflation. Their proceeds were equivalent to £321,400 in March, £334,800 in April, £442.400 in May and £478,000 in June. It is to be hoped that they may be further increased partly as a result of the curtailment of sales in other Middle Eastern countries. As is known, the rial proceeds of these sales are at present being transferred to the United States Government. 75. The financial agreements with the Persian Government covering the use of the railway system since the 1st September, 1941, by the Allied nations has not yet been signed. Some points raised on it by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have, it is believed, been settled; but approval of certain of the clauses in the agreement is at present being withheld by the United States Government who, it appears, may be unwilling to share financial responsi bility for the railway with the two other Governments, except in so far as they operate the system south of Tehran as agents of His Majesty’s Government. Meanwhile, it has not been possible to place the draft agreement before the Persian Government, who have for some time been pressing for a settlement. 76. The purchase of 600 tons of silver by the Government of India from the National Bank of Persia is under negotiation. This is in addition to the 500 tons so purchased a few months ago, the cost of which to India was increased by the necessity for paying Persian taxation before the silver could be exported. It is hoped to arrange that no taxation will be charged in respect of the second sale. 77. The expenditure on Polish refugees in Persia is decreasing substantially, mainly owing to the reduction in numbers. There has undoubtedly been extravagance on this service in the past, but steps are now being taken by His Majesty’s Embassy to impose a tighter control by requiring from the local Polish delegation explanations on doubtful items of expenditure. Economics. 78. Notwithstanding the Persian criticisms of Dr. Millspaugh, the period under review had shown a steady reinforcement of the personnel and organisa tion of his mission. Dr. H. G. Black, a prominent former member of the United States Administration, came from Washington to become Chief Administrator of the Cereals and Bread Section : and a number of other Americans arrived to take over posts in Tehran and the provinces—notably in Meshed and Tabriz in the northern zones. There was thus a good chance that the work of introducing order into Persian economic affairs would now be extended progressively to the northern zones, which have hitherto been practically inaccessible to the mission, owing to Russian obstruction. Labour troubles increased, especially in Isfahan, where riots occurred among employees in the textile mills, in which workers were injured and output was considerably reduced. The Government continued to hold adequate stocks of the monopolised goods on which the civil population depends for its existence; but distribution was bad and large sections of the population received inadequate and in some districts no rations. Distribution, in fact, remained the weakest feature of the economic system.14 79. An effort was made during the last few months to widen the scope of the various Anglo-American committees centreing round the Middle East Supply Centre and dealing with supply and industrial problems. It is hoped to arrange for representatives of the Soviet and Persian Governments to sit on a new “Higher Supply Committee.' (This would supersede the present Combined Supplies Committee which, apart from being only Anglo-American, confines its attention so far as imports are concerned to goods entering the country from the south or east.) Arrangements would also be made to have similar representation on the various sub-committees dealing with transport, industries, food supplies, import licensing, &amp;c., which would be reorganised to fit in better witn present requirements. 79a. The instruments of ratification of the Commercial Agreement between Persia and the United States which was signed in x\pril 1943, were exchanged in Washington on the 31st May. The agreement came into force thirty days later. Certain existing duties of interest to both parties are consolidated and a number of tariff concessions are made on both sides, but the . agreement contains nothing discriminatory in favour of either party. Persian exports of gums, opium and handicraft products and United States exports of motor vehicles, tyres, machinery and lubricants are among the goods affected. Cereals. 80. Grain collection at the end of June was satisfactory. Total stocks in the country on the 21st June amounted to 110,617 tons; estimated require ments until this year’s harvest begins to come in, including a reserve stock in hand of one month’s requirements, amounted to 69,154 tons : the surplus avail able to supplement this year’s harvest therefore amounted to 41,465 tons. The immediate future is assured and it is unlikely that there will be any shortage during the next six months. The Middle East Supply Centre are, nevertheless, considering the possibility of holding at a Gulf port a reserve of grain with which to meet any possible crisis that might arise. Factors liable to upset plans for the future are the possibility that the agitation against the Millspaugh Mission, which is dying down, may spring up again presently; the need to supply areas such as Khuzistan and Bushire, where, owing to crop failure this year, there will be a considerable deficit; and the dependence of the success of grain collection on the efficient distribution of cotton-piece goods, sugar and tea. There is no doubt that this would be a wise precaution to take provided that the inter national grain and shipping situation makes it feasible. ' There is also a considerable quantity of grain awaiting transport southwards from Azerbaijan. x Of a total of 25,800 tons in that province purchased by the Government, about 5,000 tons are being brought down; 10,000 tons could be carried under existing arrangements during the next two months; but for the remaining 10,000 tons i there seems to be no possibility of moving it with the transport now available. In addition, it is believed that another 15,000 tons could still be purchased from the 1943^14 harvest surplus in that area. Arrangements are therefore being made to increase the amount of transport available for this purpose by reinforcing the vehicles belonging to the Persian Road Transport Administration working locally on collection, and by Iransovtrans vehicles to carry the grain south to Tehran. If this can be successfully arranged the cereals situation for the future will be greatly strengthened. Transport. 81. The transport by rail of civil goods and cereals from the Persian Gulf and intermediate places to Tehran continued steadily under the supervision of the Millspaugh Mission and with the help of Paiforce. The wagons allotted for civil goods were on the whole efficiently used and the future prospects are good. Very little grain now remains to be transported from the south. Similarly the oil stock position throughout the country was satisfactory. 82. Mr. Shields and his American and British associates in the Road Transport Administration effected considerable improvement in the organisation of road transport. Freight rates have been revised and a system of payment instituted whicth gives less opportunity for bribery and corruption. The British i military personnel at present supervising the control of road transport in the provinces will stay until November, the Americans were due to be withdrawn in August, but efforts are being made to retain their services also until November. This should enable a good start to be made with cereals collection for 1944-45. The Road Transport Administration now has European representatives in Meshed and Tabriz, where the local Government Road Transport offices hadX 15 earned a reputation for inefficiency and corruption unequalled elsewhere in the country. 83. Persia has been allotted 540 medium-sized lorries from the Middle East quota for 1944. One hundred arrived recently in Tehran, but delivery to the Persian Government was held up by the Office of the Foreign Economic ^Administration on the authority of the Road Transport Board, on account of the Millspaugh crisis (as described above in the section on American interests). Another one hundred vehicles, also for the Persian Government, are due to arrive soon. The remainder of the quota for Persia is intended for acquisition by private importers; but the Government retains the right to take over some of these vehicles if replacements are required for the Government fleet. 84. There is a severe shortage of passenger-car tyres. Paiforce, however, have agreed to advance 400 until shipments for the Persian Government beo-in to arrive. ° - 85. It is planned to organise a National Bus Service to carry passengers and mail regularly on the principal routes. Delays in the transport of mail have for some time been a serious cause of complaint and this and certain other plans now on foot to improve this service will be very welcome. Desert Locust Control. 86. At the beginning of the June quarter all the entomologists in Persia (Persian, British and Russian) were anxiously awaiting some indication of the scale of the current invasion of desert locust swarms from Arabia. The Soviet anti-locust mission particularly entertained fears of an influx through eastern Persia into the LTiion of Soviet Socialist Republics. 87. However, the reports which filtered in during April made it clear that these swarms were small and scattered but also that they did not migrate with great impetus. Personal investigation by a Soviet entomologist proved that they had not penetrated further north than Seistan, and there and elsewhere they were shown by later reports to have scattered and probably lost their gregarious instinct, except in Laristan, the mountainous country north of Lingeh. 88. Owing to the difficulty of conveying news from that district the Persian Ministry of Agriculture are still unaware with what success their work-parties have controlled the 4.500 hectares which were infested with eggs, but there is every reason to expect that an insignificant number of locusts wilT escape. 89. The present situation in Persia is, therefore, very satisfactory and there was every justification for the withdrawal (in late April) of the British ground and air detachments from the Bandar Abbas area. Mr. Lean the British locust control officer in Persia, has returned to the United Kingdom and the other British entomologist, Mr. H. S. Darling, is being transferred to Uganda. 90.

At the end of 1943 the State Department informed His Majesty’s Embassy at Washington that the President of the United States had decided to 5A raise the American Legation at Tehran to an embassy; as a result of the Tehran ^ fce &lt;*x/vo-» Conference declaration regarding Persia, the latter was now regarded as haying _ °J^L assumed the status of co-helligerent and it was the general policy of the United J 'V?! States Government to have embassies in co-belligerent countries. ^ 3. In view of this decision His Majesty’s (Government decided to elevate the ■ t a- status of His Majesty’s Legation. On the ioth February His Majesty’s Mission issued an announcement to the effect that it had been decided to raise the status * - S', of the British and United States Legations to that of embassies; His Majesty’s ^ Government had come to the conclusion that in view of their special relations QjT i/.C. with the Persian Government, recently strengthend by the Persian declaration of war on Germany and the adherence of Persia to the I nited Nations, this change of status of their mission constituted a natural development and would serve to perpetuate the feelings of cordiality and friendship which had so long existed between Great Britain and Persia. (The United States Legation issued a similar announcement the same day.) # , . 4. I presented my new T credentials to His Imperial Majesty 1 he Shahinsnan on the 9th March. . . 5. The Persian Legation in London has likewise been raised to an embassy. A'! % Relations with India. 6. As part of a move to improve Indo-Persian relations, the Government of India in December 1943 issued an invitation to the Persian Government to send a small cultural mission to tour India this cold weather as guests of the Government of India. The mission, chosen with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Embassy, consisted of Ali Asghar Hikmat, an ex-Minister of Education and of Justice, Foor-Davoud, a professor of literature and a specialist in Aveztic studies and ancient Persian law, and Rashid-i-Yasemi, a professor of history. 7. The mission reached New Delhi on the 8th March, 1944. and are still in India. They stayed a few days at the Viceroy’s house, visited Delhi University, the Delhi Polytechnic, where they saw war technicians under training, All-India Radio and the ancient monuments of Delhi. From here the mission proceeded on a tour of Lahore, Aligarh, Benares, Allahabad, Bombay and Hyderabad (Deccan), visiting museums, universities, industries and colleges of all kinds. Aftei visiting Bangalore and Madras the official tour will terminate, hut it is understood that one or two members of the mission propose to spend further time in India pursuing their investigations. The mission was entertained at various places by Governors of provinces and other distinguished persons, by city corporations, Islamic and other societies and the staffs of universities and colleges. From reports received the mission appears to have been a success. Much will now depend on the extent to which the members disseminate the facts they have acquired in India on their return to Persia. The majority even of educated Persians are entirely ignorant of the culture and the progress in scientific and industrial matters to be found in India. 8 Meanwhile the Public Relations Bureau. Tehran, has organised an exhibition of photographs of life, industry and the ancient monuments of India, [53—28] RECO. tti- 4 B2 which is arousing some interest. It is hoped, before the exhibition closes, to give a reception to local notables at which at least some of the members of the mission will be present to give their personal experiences. Security. 9. Asa result of further strong pressure by this mission the Persian Govern^ ment and the Soviet Embassy eventually agreed that the Persian suspects the internment camp at Sultanabad on the Russian list should be transferred to the Russian zone. They were removed from Sultanabad on the 3rd February, and after a stay in Tehran were transferred to Resht. The joint investigation by the Anglo-Persian Commission of the suspects on the British list was completed by the 23rd February, and it was decided to release twenty-three; only one of them, however, was found to be completely innocent. The remainder were made to sign an undertaking :— (a) To refrain from anti-Allied activities; (b) To notify any change of address; (c) To report to the police when required; and (d) To communicate to the Persian and British authorities any information regarding anti-Allied activities which might come to their notice. The Soviet Embassy was kept informed of the release of these suspects. 10. In the middle of March the Persian Government pressed His Majesty’s Mission to allow the internees still remaining at Sultanabad to be transferred to Tehran. This has been agreed to in principle, and the internees will be transferred as soon as the new camp has been made secure. 11. After prolonged negotiations with the British Security authorities the Qashgai handed over to them four Germans whom they had been harbouring for a number of months. A fifth German, who was born in Russia but had lived many years in Persia, had escaped or had been allowed to escape two or three weeks before. So far as is known there are no other Germans loose in Persia. 12. Our Security authorities had intercepted in Syria two of Nasir Qashgai’s brothers, who were returning to Persia from Germany, and this was not without influence on the outcome of the negotiations. The two gentlemen are now being restored to the bosom of their tribe. Antflo-Persian Public Relations. 13. The Public Relations Bureau continued to disseminate propaganda material in considerable quantities throughout the country. This reading matter is eagerly sought after and the principal periodicals are now firmly established. A new venture in the form of a fortnightly children’s newspaper, designed primarily to project Britain and the Commonwealth to the impressionable youth of Persia, has been particularly successful, and over 17,500 copies are regularly bought by school-children all over the country. 14. The half-hour daily broadcasts from Tehran Radio by the Public Relations Bureau were favourably received, and particular interest was shown in a new series of talks given by Persian “ guest speakers.” The mobile cinema vans of the bureau continued to give performances throughout the country, and in several areas reached audiences which had hitherto never seen a cinema. 15. Window displays and exhibitions on a variety of subjects were arranged in Tehran and at our consulates. An exhibition of pictures depicting “ Women of Great Britain ” attracted special attention and was seen by many thousands of people. 16. Publicity was given to the activities of the Middle East Supply Centre and other British institutions giving material help to the country through the medium of special articles written for the English daily newspaper published by the bureau and for the local Persian press. 17. Special attention continued to be paid to propaganda directed towards the many Allied nationals in Tehran and the classes in English instituted by the Bureau by agreement with the British Council attracted over 400 pupils from the Czech and Polish communities. British Council Activities. 18. Tehran. —-The Anglo-Persian Institute in Tehran now has 800 adult students and 750 club members. The staff also teaches in the University, Teachers’ Training College, schools, Technical College and Survey Department of the Ministry of Mines, and the National Bank. By using the voluntary3 services of British persons employed in the embassy, Army and Koyal Air Force, evening classes for 500 more adult students have been opened in a school (previously the American College) belonging to the Ministry of Education. Classes in the Agricultural College, near Tehran, have been started, and selected students will be sent to agricultural universities in India. A large building belonging to the Tehran Municipality has been leased and all council activities, /&lt;her than teaching, will be moved to it. The Anglo-Persian Medical Association, dramatic Society, Art Club and Music Society have increased their activities. A Shakespeare play will be staged out-of-doors in June. It is intended to publish the British medical bulletin in Persian, and broadcast English lessons from the Tehran Broadcasting Station will commence in April. 19. Isfahan .—The Anglo-Persian Institute in Isfahan now has 350 adult students and 150 club members. To accommodate the increasing number of members the removal of all club activities to another building is under consideration. The demand for further teaching, particularly in the twelve large Isfahan factories, is insistent but cannot be undertaken owing to shortage of staff. 20. General .—Special courses in the Tehran and Isfahan institutes for those wishing to take entrance examinations in Persia for British universities will be started in April. Many applications have been received for the six research scholarships in the United Kingdom, already offered by the council, for October 1944. The opening of institutes elsewhere in Persia (which has been strongly urged by all consulates) cannot be considered until more staff is avail able. A merican Interests. 21. As stated in paragraph 3 the American Legation has been raised to an embassy. Mr. Dreyfus, the Minister, has been on leave since the Tehran Conference and is not returning. It is announced that the first American Ambassador to Tehran will be Mr. Leland B. Morris, at present Minister in Iceland, where he will be succeeded by Mr. Dreyfus. ° n t ? le , 3rd March the Foreign Office informed His Majesty’s Mission that there might be some discussions regarding Middle East policy with Mr. Stettinius, who was to visit the United Kingdom in the second half of March , if there were any special questions affecting Anglo-American relations. His Majesty s Mission was to telegraph brief notes. In reply, His Majesty’s Mission pointed out that— 7 J ^ {a) The lack of co-ordination between the American advisers in Persia was somewhat disturbing; the United States Government and His Majesty s Mission were equally desirous that the advisers should succeed, being convinced that if they failed Persia had a poor chance ot keeping her feet, unless some dictator, so resolute as Reza Shah and much more intelligent, came to the front. Russia hardly concealed her animosity towards the advisers in general and openly hampered their work The advisers, however, had no cohesion among them selves and His Majesty s Mission wished to suggest that there should he some co-ordinating authority. This should be the American Embassy and His Majesty s Mission considered that instructions to that end should be given to the new American Ambassador- His Majesty s Mission added that the American Charge d’Affaires, m 'm. * 0 . °j ',' tt ln o enel ' a l agreement with their views. (b) 1 he Standard-Vacuum Company and the Shell Group, backed by American and British Governments respectively, were competing for oil concessions m Persia. The Persians, and probably hi Russians, were likely to regard this as a conflict of national interests and to rejoice accordingly. Apart from the desirability of avoiding I • Mhe’p r Ang p Amerlcan rlvall T. His Majesty’s Mission suggested that the Persian Government were not likely to grant a new concession InnlU’f' lnte 1 r i f ts . whel ' 'i* 16 grant of a concession to American applicants would at once give the powerful United States Govern ment an economic interest in the fate of Persia. (To this the Foreign He Ce U P ’‘f tlmt the d T' ablllt y of reaching an understanding w^h the Americans over oil concessions was fullv realised hv TTt- Majesty’s Government, but that meanwhile ffifMaje ty^ Mission should continue to support the Shell groun ) ' Mission [53—28] 57 b4 Soviet Interests. 23. During February there was a scare regarding the alleged arrival of fresh Soviet troops in North Persia; after making enquiries, His Majesty’s Mission reported to the Foreign Office that the rumours were not confirmed, although there had been some reliefs of Russian troops and an additional labour battalion had been brought into Persia. In March, however, confirmation was received from several sources of movements and increases of Soviet troops aloi^' the Turkish frontier; previous troops had been relieved by fresh troops and garrisons at Khoi, Shahpur and Hazirgan, had been reinforced, though not on a large scale. The Soviet military attache denied that there had been any increases. 24. The Soviet section of the Tripartite Censorship in Tehran has recently begun to examine, with the greatest care, all books sent out from the United Kingdom to booksellers in Persia, and they have now listed about twenty as prohibited. The list includes a number of books which are admittedly highly critical of the Soviet regime, but also Modern Iran, by Mr. Elwell-Sutton, a member of the staff of the Public Relations Bureau, and Robert Byron’s First Russia, Then Tibet. They have also refused to allow to be distributed many items of news in which the British section saw no harm. In some cases, the items have subsequently been published in The Daily News which, being regarded by the Soviet authorities as the official organ of His Majesty’s Embassy, is immune from censorship. The. Russians claim that all the news which they send in is immune from censorship, being sent under the auspices of Tass and therefore official. In this way they distribute the most ferocious slanders on the Poles, while they object to the mildest defence of the Polish case. One telegram, which we printed in the Daily News after the Soviet section had prohibited its general distribution, merely pointed out the obvious fact that the splendid Russian victories had been facilitated to some extent by the Anglo- American air attacks on German industrial targets. 25. The cultural activities of the Russians in Persia are increasing. On the 6th February the inauguration ceremony was held of a newly-formed committee for Soviet-Persian Cultural Relations. (Please compare penultimate paragraph of my despatch under reference.) The Persian Prime Minister and the Soviet Ambassador are honorary presidents. The committee has not yet taken any building for cultural activities in spite of many rumours to the contrary. The teaching of the Russian language by Russians in the university, schools, and in technical and agricultural colleges is now being strongly urged upon the Persian authorities. Polish Interests. 26. The main event affecting the Polish refugees in Persia during the penqd under reference was the visit of M. Henryk Strasburger, the Polish Minister of State. I his was the second time that a member of the Polish Government had visited Persia, the previous occasion being the visit of M. btanczyk, the Minister of Social Welfare, in the spring of 1943. JVL Strasburger arrived on the 24th February, spent fourteen days in Tehran, where he made a thorough tour of inspection and then spent four days visiting ^ o ls ^ bj n ^ ren s c °lo n y in Isfahan. He left Persia on the 12th March, n ooo number of Polish civilians in Persia on the 1st January was i • i ^ en&lt; ^ ^ arc l 1 hnd been reduced to 8,366. In the interval one ship left with 849 Poles with Rhodesia as their ultimate destination. The remaining odd 400 left for various destinations such as Palestine or (in the case of a few) the Lnited Kingdom either as military personnel recruited in Tehran or as civilians. Negotiations were started for the settlement of 500 Poles in Syria and for about 200 Young Men’s Christian Association, Young Women’s Christian Association and Red Cross personnel to be transferred to Palestine. Neither of these plans had matured by the end of the period under discussion. 28. As the bulk of Polish refugees come from the eastern provinces of Poland, the declaration by Mr. Churchill concerning the future eastern frontier of Poland had a disturbing and demoralising effect on the refugees in Persia and rendered more difficult the task of the British authorities who deal with them. A fresh difficulty was created towards the end of March when some Poles repre senting the Union of Polish Patriots in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics set up an office in Tehran and began to angle for support among the refugees, using as bait the offer to allow the refugees to communicate with their relations in Russia and to send them parcels. £ $Internal Politics and Majlis. 29. The position at the end of 1943 was that the Majlis was not in session, the 13th legislative period having come to an end and the 14th not having commenced. About one half of the Deputies had been elected, but the results of the Tehran elections were not known, though voting had finished. Provincial results were, however, coming in steadily, and early in January a sufficient number Q Deputies to enable the Majlis to open were elected. The formal opening was fixed for the 22nd January and all arrangements were made, when, as the result of a series of intrigues, the ceremony was postponed. The Shah was certainly against the opening, and went so far as to suggest to His Majesty’s Minister that as the elections had been so badly conducted it would be a good plan to annul them and to have fresh elections under a Prime Minister in whom everyone would have confidence, viz., Dr. Musaddiq. His Majesty spoke of large sums spent on votes and interference by officials and by the Russians. The truth seems to have been that what the Shah really wanted was to have a more sub servient Majlis : he was also apprehensive of what would happen when Seyyid Zia Tabatabai took his seat, and hoped that in fresh elections the Seyyid might be defeated. His Majesty’s Minister deprecated the Shah’s plan and pointed out that it did not seem to be founded on good constitutional grounds as the Majlis was in a.ny case bound to examine the Deputies’ credentials and hear any complaints of irregularity : new elections, especially if governed by a new electoral law promulgated by decree, would therefore be likely to arouse feeling against the Shah himself. The Shah finally abandoned his plan, alleging as his reason that Dr. Musaddiq wanted first to hold a referendum to amend the electoral law. 30. The date of formal opening was finally fixed foi the 26th February, and the Majlis was in due course opened on that day by the Shah, who made a speech setting forth the tasks which lay before the Majlis during the 14th legislative period. 31. Then ensued the usual examination of the credentials of Deputies. A number of objections were tabled, the most interesting being those against the election of Seyyid Zia Tabatabai. The attack was led by Dr. Musaddiq. who based his objection not on the election proceedings at Yezd but on the Seyvid’s unfitness to be a Deputy owing to his share in the cony d'PAat of February 1921 and the subsequent events. A full-dress debate ensued, during which a good deal of past history was brought up by both sides, and Seyyid Zia took the opportunity to give his version of what exactly did happen then. He argued that he, and he only, was responsible for what he did at that time, i.e., that he was not in any way subject to British influence, and he took advantage of the opportunity to state how friendly he had been to the Soviet Government at that time. His oratory made a good impression on the Deputies and his credentials were passed by secret ballot with a good majority. The only Deputy whose credentials were definitely rejected was Durri, the Deputy for Darajez, whose election was said to have been secured by all kinds of irregular intervention and military pressure, which must have meant pressure from the Russians. 32. Muhammad Taghi Assad (Amir Jang) was elected temporary president of the Majlis for the examination of credentials, and afterwards Seyyid Muhammad Sadigh Tabatabai, who had been in charge of the Tehran electoral committee, was elected president. 33. The Tehran elections passed off without any great surprises : no Tudeh candidates got in for Tehran, nor did Qawam-es-Saltaneh nor Seyyid Zia, and some rich contractors who bought votes on a grand scale were also disappointed. The notorious mujtahid Seyyid Abul Qasim Kashani, was among the first twelve, but after pressure from His Majesty’s Ambassador his name was omitted from the list by the Government. The highly-respectable but aloof Mu’tamin-ul-Mulk Pirnia was high in the list of successful candidates, but as usual refused to serve. Another successful candidate was the aged Firuzabadi, but objections to his candidature on the ground that he was older than the age-limit of 70 were made and appeared likely to unseat him. The elections of Tabriz were at last finished by about the 21st March, but the votes had not been counted by the end of the period under review. 34. Apart from the resignation of General Shafai in February in circumstances mentioned below, the Soheily Cabinet, which had been formed on the 16th December, remained in power till the business of passing credentials had been got out of the way. Soheily then resigned, having guessed that the feeling of the Majlis was against him. After a good deal of talk about Ahy, Ambassador in Moscow, and Mansour, Governor-General of Khorasan, the Shah asked Sa’ed6 to form a Cabinet, and after deliberation during the No Ruz holidays from the 21st March onwards Sa’ed announced his team as follows :— Prime Minister : Muhammad Sa’id Maraghe’i. Agriculture : Mahmud Fateh. Commerce and Industry : Amanullah Ardalan. Communications : Hamid Sayyah. Education : Sarlashkar Ali Riazi. ^ Finance : Mahmud Nariman. Foreign : Muhammad Sa’id Maraghe’i. Interior : Abdul Hussein Hajhir. Justice : Asadullah Hamaqani. Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones : Abul Qasim Furuhar. Health : Dr. Qasim Ghani. War : Ibrahim Zand. Without portfolio: Murteza Quli Bayat, Mustafa Adi. 35. i wo Ministers who were thought to be the nominees of the Shah, viz., Intizam and Moussa Moury-Esfandiary were thus dropped, though a third, Zand, Minister tor War, remained. Two new names appear : Mahmoud Fateh and Mahmoud Nariman; the former’s appointment was interpreted in some quarters as a mark of the Shah’s appreciation of the opposition of Mustafa Fateh, Mahmoud s brother, to Seyyid Zia. The latter was known as a young man of intelligence possessing a sound knowledge of finance and able to speak English, a great advantage in dealing with Dr. Millspaugh. At the end of March Sa’ed had only announced his programme : he did not venture to present his Cabinet for the Majlis s approval, as the Chamber showed itself divided and capricious : in fact, at the end of the quarter it looked as if the Majlis would accept Sa’ed but not his colleagues. 36. Three general remarks are worthy of notice in the political events of this quarter. I he first is the fact that the Russians displayed great interest m the internal affairs of the country. Evidence was forthcoming of their intervention in the personnel of Soheily’s Cabinet of December 1943^ they had objected to the inclusion of Tadayyun and Amir Ahmedi. They also supported the Tudeh party with hardly a pretence of concealment, and in the intrigues connected with the postponement of the opening of the Majlis on the 22nd January the Tudeh Deputies, after having strongly supported the opening suddenly veered round to the opposite side on instructions from the Soviet Embassy.’ Then* opposition to Seyyid Zia Tabatabai also continued, in spite of the latter’s eftorts to convince them that he was not anti-Russian. In the Tabriz elections it was also evident that the Soviet authorities were insisting on the inclusion of certain Communist candidates. , p? 7 - . The se 9 ond general remark concerns the Shah. There has been a definite increase in the anti-Shah feeling which was noticed in previous reports. Ine ^hah s intervention in the army continued; he w r ent on issuing orders on military matters without informing the Chief of the General Staff. His Majesty made use of Dr Musaddiq to oppose Seyyid Zia. The Majlis showed that they objected to the Shah s nominees in the Cabinet, his support of the candidature ol a certain Muhit for Saqqiz, his interference in judicial proceedings, his frequent changes of opinion, and his support of General Shafai, the Minister of Commerce, when the latter accidentally killed a workman in the course of a strike, were all the subject of adverse criticism. Th 38 ’ i^e third remark, 18 the growth of the power of parties and unions. The so-called fractions ’ in the Majlis had little programme and no cohesion; A 1 t Tudeh j s P9 eac j lts influence in various parts of the country, notably j 11 f nd P erha P s i? Abadan : various workers’ organisations, usually called Ittihadieh i karagan appeared in some towns : Sevyid Zia also began'serious preparations towards founding a brand-new party of' his own, by a process of forming circles of progressive elements throughout the country. qu n 9 ' Fu f th ^ revidence of popular determination to show detestation of Reza Shah was afforded by the trial of various police officials in connexion with the deaths of the Communist Dr Arani and the Zoroastrian Deputy Arbab Tvei-Khosraw; one police doctor being sentenced to death and other officials to terms of imprisonment, , r 4n vr during the quarter the well-known leader of the Tudeh party, Suleiman Mirza Muhsin Iskandari, died and was given an impressive funeral, some members of the Soviet Embassy being present. memners7 41. Princess Ashraf, the Shah’s twin sister and previously the wife of Ali Qawam, married an Egyptian named Ahmad Shafiq, the son of a pasha. 42. A good deal of popular indignation was worked up about the execution of a Persian pilgrim at Mecca on a charge of polluting the holy shrine; the Persian Government went so far as to threaten to break off relations with Saudi Arabia unless they were given satisfaction. i ribcd Situation. 43. The tribal situation has remained comparatively peaceful since the beginning of the year, the tribes having been allowed in large part to manage their own affairs. On the other hand, no steps have been taken by the Govern ment towards a permanent settlement of the tribal problem, an essential condition of which is the establishment among the tribes of some confidence in the Government. It is true that, thanks largely to the initiative and co-operation of British officials, rationed issues of tea, sugar and cloth at controlled prices were made to certain Lur and Bakhtiari tribes living adjacent to the railway and to some of the Ivuhgalu tribes adjacent to the oilfields area, but this will be interpreted as a recognition of the capacity and opportunities for mischief of those tribes rather than as a reward for virtue or an indication of a change of heart in the Government. The tribes generally get no share of the Government stocks of these commodities. 44. In Ears the growing conviction that the Government is powerless against Nasir Qashgai is inducing tribes such as the Khamseh and the Mamassanni to make outward signs of co-operation with Nasir. But it is doubtful whether they really relish the prospect of having to recognise his overlordship, entailing, as it would, the payment of tribute in money or in kind; and there are indications that Nasir is none too confident of the support he would receive if Government should ever pluck up the courage to assert its authority. A peaceful demonstration by Persian troops towards the Bahmai and Janeki tribes, north-east of the oilfields, with the object of inducing them to surrender some arms, though they lie far from his sphere, is reported to have provoked in Nasir an outburst of nervous anger at such improper conduct of the Persian army and threats of raising all the tribes from Khuzestan to Persian Baluchistan in the defence of tribal interests or alternatively of divesting himself of all responsibility for the order of the tribes of Ears. It is possible that he may instigate some brigandage in order to squeeze more concessions out of the Government and to frighten the people of Shiraz into supporting him. This would not necessarily affect any British war interest; most of the tribes in close contact with the oilfields and the railway—the Darashuri and Qashquli sections of the Qashgai. some of the Kuhgalu tribes, the Bakhtiari and the Lurs—although none of them will miss a chance of thieving, are not, as far as mv present information goes, likely to be a serious threat to British interests. There is more doubt as to the possible action of those sections of the Boir Ahmedi who follow Abdullah Khan Zarghampur, but even they do not as yet give any real cause for anxiety. 45. In Bakhtiari some discontent is becoming evident with the rather arbitrary government of Morteza Quli Khan, who, in spite of his protestations to the contrary, appears to be reverting to the customs of the days of Ilkhani rule, the return of which would be hardly more welcome to the tribesmen than the return of the military regime of Reza Shah’s days. Morteza Quli Khan is reported to be levying on the tribe the old taxes levied by the Ilkhanis and abolished by Reza Shah. And he is departing from a well-established custom of the old days when the lucrative posts in tribal administration were evenly distributed between the two rival branches of the ruling family. Now only his own relatives get these opportunities, and the disgruntled Khans of the other branch heartily encourage all the discontent they can find. Persian Forces. 46. (a) Army. Indecision,conflictingviews, internal intrigues and personal interests continue to obstruct attempts to reform the army. Persian supporters of the American advisers universally expressed disappointment at their apparentlv disinterested attitude towards the execution of the plans which they have them selves prepared. It is not true that the advisers are disinterested, but it would not be far from the truth to sav that they are too inclined to adopt the attitude that it is for them to give advice and for the Persian authorities to act on it Having regard to the strength of the opposition that is determined to discredit them, it may safely be said that they cannot hope to achieve success unless theys 1 take an intimate and aggressive interest in the execution of their schemes. Such of these as have been initiated are not functioning in a manner that carries conviction of their value, but this is due more to a lack of determination in operation than to unsoundness in the schemes. It should, however, be remembered that the advisers are very few for the difficult task before them. W ith the arrival of more officers it is to 'be hoped that the situation will improve. Of the nine additional officers demanded from America to make a total of twenty, two h«g' arrived and seven are on the way. They will, however, continue to be handi capped in relation to the opposition until they are vested with such powers and influence as will establish them as the deciding factor in the advancement of officers. What is needed is that they should have the full support and confidence of the Shah. It is to be regretted that this they have so far failed to get. The Shah is disappointed because they have been unsympathetic to his desires for a large army with quantities of the most modern arms and because they have hitherto failed to obtain more than a few items of the stores and equipment he would like to have. Moreover, he has allowed himself to be persuaded by the hostile criticism of his two irresponsible military advisers, Generals Yazdan Panah and Razmara, and the implied criticism of the Russians, that the proposals of the American advisers, even those to which he has already given his approval, are unsuited to the conditions of Persia. 47. The American mission has begun the organisation of transport units equipped principally with the 600 trucks recently received from American sources. Here they claim to be making progress in spite of the many difficulties that arise from indiscipline, corruption, lack of workshop equipment for maintenance and of trained personnel. Their plans are ready for the organisation of field medical, signal and engineer units as soon as equipment is obtained. The new systems of supply and pay have not yet convinced the private soldier that there is anything of the fairy godmother about the American advisers. Lack of reliable personnel, lack of funds and lack of stores—such reserves as there were having been consumed during the last two years without replenishment—have effectively prevented the successful operation of the new system. 48. For a time the Shah’s head seemed to be completed turned by his con versation with Marshal Stalin during the Tehran Conference and by the latter’s offer to him of a gift of tanks and aircraft. He appeared to have convinced him self that he would have Stalin’s support in his ambition to have a large army under his personal command and Stalin’s assistance in equipping it. He sought for means to please his Russian friends. He dismissed the pro-British Minister of War. General Ahmadi; and later General Ansari, the Under-Secretary of State for War, who was also displeasing to the Russians. He was also clearly anxious to replace General Riazi, the Chief of Staff, who has co-operated frankly with us and with the American advisers, by General Yazdan Panah, who would be more acceptable to himself and the Russians. Fearing, perhaps, that to do so immediately would appear too obviously as an anti-British gesture, he postponed action until the formation of a new Cabinet gave him opportunity of getting rid of General Riazi from the General Staff by appointing him as Minister of Education. His successor has not yet been named. 49. Reflection and the views of his Ministers have to some extent modified his elation and roused doubts of the disinterestedness of the Russian gift, to which it has been found certain unwelcome conditions were attached. For the Russian offer extends to the organisation of tank and aircraft regiments with a strong framework of Russian personnel, and obvious Persian unwillingness to walk into this trap may result in the withdrawal of the bait. 50. There has been much discussion as to the strength of the army that should be budgeted for in the financial year just beginning. The Shah held out for 120,0Q0; Dr. Millspaugh maintained that he could not find more money than the 100 million tomans allotted for the past year. The final decision of the Government was that the Ministry for War should budget for a strength of 90.000 Dr. Millspaugh being left to find the money as best he could. The Shah has, however, demanded that a further credit should be allotted for an additional 10.000 men, to be drawn against only if circumstances should demand this increase to the army. The organisation on which the figure of 90,000 is based that is ten divisions, each with a strength of 5,000-6,000, and, in addition, independent cavalry and mechanised brigades in the capital—has been considered by the Commander-in-chief of Persia and Iraq Force and it is understood that he considers it reasonable having regard to the task before the army. 51. (b) Gendarmerie .—In the gendarmerie Colonel Schwarzkopf has been given extensive authority and has, in practice, complete control of the force,9 under the Minister of the Interior. That no improvement is yet visible is due not to any lack of enthusiasm or energy on his part but largely to lack of sufficient funds to pay the officers and men of the force a living wage, to shortage of clothing and equipment and, in some degree, to his own too great confidence in the co-operation of his Persian colleagues. He is planning for the current year for a force of eighteen regiments, with a total strength of 28,000 officers and men, divided into eight districts corresponding approximately with the provinces; '^h of six districts to have two regiments and the Tehran and Pars districts to have three each. The cost of this force, at the rates of pay he considers necessary to attract a suitable type of man, will probably amount to 50-60 million tomans for the year, an increase of 100 per cent, on the provision made last year. An additonal three American officers are now on their way to join Colonel Schwarzkopf’s staff which, on their arrival, will total six. Persian A ir Force. 52. The reorganisation of the Persian Air Force drags slowly on. They are resuming under Royal Air Force guidance various brandhes of training which have been neglected over recent years and a certain amount of their equip ment is being shown to be more serviceable than they thought. It is hoped that the delivery of their eagerly-awaited Ansons may be the beginning of a serious attempt to reach a degree of operational efficiency. 53. Colonel Stedakh, who was attending the Middle East Staff College, has had a nervous breakdown and has had to be recalled to Tehran. Headquarters, Royal Air Force, Middle East, have offered to accept another officer, if a suitable one can be found, for the summer course at the college. Finance. 54. The inflationary situation remains serious, though the prospects of keeping it under control are better since the staff of the Millspaugh Mission has been increased. It is hoped to achieve more success in the enforcement of the Price Stabilisation Regulations and in the curtailment of black market activities; while Dr. Millspaugh also feels reasonably optimistic about the budgetary situation, as revenue is coming in better than he had expected. Ihere are also indications that the Persian Government, no doubt under pressure from the Millspaugh Mission, are taking steps to put their house in order. They have begun a series of investigations into large-scale embezzlements and frauds which have occurred in various Government administration departments, and as a result there have been some dismissals and arrests in the Road Transport Department, the army and in the Ministry of Finance. The cost of living indices still show up upward tendency, though of late the rate of increase has slackened. In December the figure was 1,050, in January 1,076, and in February 1,082. The wholesale price index over the same period was 665, 668 and 662 respectively. The incidence of note circulation also increased during the past three months. On the 14th December currency notes in circulation amounted to 5,195*07 million rials, while on the 12th February they had risen to 5,701 *06 million rials. 55. The currency situation gave rise to some anxiety in February. It was found that, unless a substantial portion of the note forms which are being printed in London were flown to Tehran immediately upon delivery from the printers, there would be a serious currency shortage in April, and air transport did not seem to be available. If such a ^shortage occurred, not only would it seriously embarrass the Persian Government in its financial obligations, but it would also affect the supply of war materials to the Soviet Union. A peculiarity of the situation was that, although the National Bank of Iran was short of notes, the Imperial Bank of Iran had a surplus of about 300 million rials in excess of its normal reserve. It was suggested that these rials might be utilised to finance British military expenditure in Persia over the crucial two or three months when the currency shortage would be most acute, thus easing the position of the National Bank, which would otherwise be called upon to produce rials against sterling to meet this expenditure. Several technical difficulties arose in trying to find the manner in which this could best be accomplished to everyone’s satis faction. but in the event it was found possible to transport to Persia by air notes to the value of 450 million rials, which relieved the situation. 56. The conclusion of a financial agreement to cover the use of the Iranian State railways by the Allied Powers has hung fire for over two years, but at the [53—28] c10 -c beginning of the year negotiations were speeded up, and a draft agreement was prepared by us in consultation with the American authorities, and submitted to the Russians for their approval. The draft as finally agreed between the Russians, the Americans and ourselves will then form a basis for subsequent negotiation with the Persian Government. 57. I he new silver coinage which the Majlis had authorised to be minted was put into circulation for the first time on the 29th February. The denomina tions of the coins are 1 rial, 2 rials, 5 rials and 10 rials, and are legal tender to 0Ty extent ol 500 rials. So far, only the 1- and 5-rial pieces have appeared. The coins are ol 600 fineness, composed of an alloy of silver and copper, and their total value will be 100 million rials. Although silver is being sold in the open market in the Tehran bazaar at 760 rials per 1,000 grammes (916 fine), and the value of the new 1-rial piece at that price is therefore -795 rials, there was an immediate run on the banks for these coins, and later the 5-rial pieces were being sold on the street for 6 or 7 rials each. These are presumably being hoarded. 58. The silver deal with the Government of India, under which the National Bank of Iran sold to them 500 tons of cut rupees, rial and kran coins, has now been completed, the final shipment being made on the 19th March. The bank sold 120 tons at 80 rupees per 100 tolas (916) fine) and 380 tons at 93 rupees 12 annas per 100 tolas (916 fine). The former price was approximately that at which the Persian Government had previously bought 120 tons of silver from India, while the latter is the price ruling on the open market in Persia. Economic Situation. 59. In spite of the good harvest last year and the provision of nearly a thousand lend-lease trucks, the country was faced at the beginning of 1944 with another bread and transport crisis. This was happily averted by the combined efforts of the Millspaugh Mission, Paiforce and the Middle East Supply Centre. Dr. Millspaugh recognised the need to concentrate on cereals collection and the organisation of transport; and the Persian Government were fortunately able to have the help of these Allied organisations. The Middle East Supply Centre provided fifteen British officers and n.c.os. to help in supervising the collection and movement of grain and another twenty-five to assist with the control of civil road transport. Paiforce provided transport companies, which moved 17,000 tons of cereals from the Kermanshah-Hamadan area to the railway. Thanks to this measure, bread supplies for the population of Tehran and other centres were assured. The transport of civil goods by rail from the south to Tehran also improved following the appointment of a British officer to the Millspaugh Mission to supervise loadings. 60. The distribution of tea, sugar, piece-goods, drugs and other essential goods was another story. This was a failure, in spite of the Government’s large stocks of these commodities and of considerable efforts made by Dr. Millspaugh and his mission. Most of the civil population did without these “necessities” and bazaar prices remained at very high levels. Unfortunately, some of the measures aimed at reducing prices which were passed by Dr. Millspaugh have tended to aggravate the situation by holding up distribution by merchants. Some of the harmful measures were later rescinded; but the monopolisation of the commodities mentioned above is still a hindrance rather than a help to distribution. 61. The Persian Government agreed in January to supply the Russians with 36,000 tons of low-grade rice at considerably below cost price in exchange for Russian goods to the value of about £320,000. Like the arms contract now in force between the Persians and the Russians, this agreement is financially disadvantageous to the Persians. A new Rice Monopoly Company was set up to collect and deliver rice to the Russians (and also to the civil population of Persia), but its success up to date has not been remarkable. T rans'port. 62. Mr. Floyd F. Shields arrived from the United States during the quarter and assumed the direction of the Road Transport Administration. He has three American assistants and the twenty-five British officers and n.c.os. provided by the Middle East Supply Centre to work temporarily with the Persian Government to help organise civil road transport on a proper basis. The Government11 Departments concerned with transport have been reorganised and the usual hopes are held that the future will be brighter. Supplies of tyres and spare parts for motor vehicles are being received satisfactorily; but lack of maintenance facilities is still one of the chief handicaps to the proper use of the Government’s fleet of motor vehicles. 63. With the extra staff at its disposal the Road Transport Administration .^egan to exert its authority in the provinces. In some places, particularly ^■horassan, it encountered opposition from local officials. In Meshed the Governor-General and the local road transport officials have developed a very profitable private racket, which ensures that almost anything profitable will be transported and very little that is really essential. But as the influence of the Road Transport Administration increases a diminution in these practices and an increase in the transport of essential goods may be expected. 64. The movement of civil goods by railway from the south to Tehran improved considerably, and no anxiety is felt on this score either in connexion with supplies of oil or of other commodities. Cereals. 65. It may now be stated with reasonable certainty that there will be no need to import grain from abroad between now and the forthcoming harvest. Out of a target of 310,000 tons required to feed the towns approximately 305,000 tons have been collected. There are at present about six weeks’ stocks in the Tehran silo and over 12,000 tons surplus (almost two months' stocks) available in the southern region of the country for transport to the capital. 66. The target of 310.000 tons, however, does not include the substantial reserve necessary to maintain confidence to tide over the period of harvesting and to provide against the possibility of an indifferent harvest this year. The failure so far to accumulate this reserve is entirely due to poor deliveries from the northern region. Deliveries to Tehran from the southern region have, by totalling 50,000 tons, exceeded expectations. Similar deliveries from the northern and most fertile region of the country have only just exceeded 17,000 tons instead of reaching the 40,000 tons which might most reasonably have been expected. The difference of 23,000 tons, when added to further possible deliveries from the south, would have constituted a reserve, albeit a small one, with which to start the next agricultural year. Unless deliveries from the north increase materially during the next few weeks the Persian Government grain reserve at harvest time is likely to be insignificant. 67. Lateness of rain, and lack of rain in some areas, have caused anxiety regarding the forthcoming crop. The profiteers have taken full advantage of this by raising the free-market price of grain and by spreading exaggerated rumours of the failure of crops. Well-informed circles have estimated, so far as it is possible to form an estimate at this stage, that the present crop is unlikely to exceed 70 per cent, of the last crop. Locust control. 68. From the beginning of the year until the 23rd March there were no desert locust swarms in Persia, and the reports received from British Baluchistan and from Oman had been consistently reassuring. Preparations had therefore been made for the withdrawal of the Royal Air Force Anti-Locust Flight to East Africa, the return of the mechanised regiment of the Transjordan Frontier Force to Middle East Command, and the early withdrawal of the British Locust Officer from Persia. 69. Between the 23rd and 31st March, however, half a dozen reports have been received which indicate that three or more swarms of indefinite size are moving in the Kerman and Eastern Pars provinces. Unfortunately their appearance was so unexpected that the British anti-locust unit was not able to attack any of them with D.N.O.C. poison dust as they crossed the coastal area. The situation is still very obscure, as exact information has not been received about the size of the swarms or the maturity of the locusts. 70. Mr. Lean at once asked for the retention of the Royal Air Force and military units, and A.H.Q., Persia and Iraq, have agreed. General Headquarters, Middle East, however, could only agree to the retention of the mechanised regiment of the Transjordan Frontier Force until the 10th April, as they are required for duty in the Middle East Command thereafter.71. It is therefore to be hoped that in the next ten days the swarms will be proved to be small (and therefore controllable by the Persian authorities) or else will be largely destroyed. Otherwise the withdrawal of the British anti-locust unit immediately after the arrival of swarms in this country will not only impress the Persian Government unfavourably but may also do harm to the Allied war effort if Persian crops are exposed to serious damage. 72.

[E 602/189/34] ° i i i n a i I U ' i With tha Und®** Stat« for For. Affairs January 27, 1944. Section 2. Copy No. 122 Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—{Received 21 th January) /to (No. 10 . Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, 1th January, 1944. SINCE my despatch No. 462 of the 23rd November 1943 , all other events from that date to' the end of the year were overshadowed by the Tehran Conference, which excited the interest and flattered the vanity of the Persian people, who, had they been permitted, would have exhibited their feelings in demonstrations, receptions and gifts. The repression of these manifestations under pressure of secrecy caused some slight resentment, but this was quickly dissipated when the Anglo-Russian-American declaration about Persia was issued. 2. An indiscretion by Tehran radio during the passage of Mr. Eden and Mr. Hull through Tehran in October, which revealed their presence to the world, and might possibly have endangered their safety on their way to Moscow, led to the adoption of the severest measures of secrecy on the occasion of the Tehran Conference. Until Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt were about to arrive no hint was given to the Persian Government. We did not know that some days earlier the Soviet Charge d’Affaires, on instructions from Moscow, had informed the Prime Minister that it was proposed to hold a conference in Tehran and had asked the Prime Minister how this would be viewed by the Persian Government— a question to which he received an enthusiastic approval. He even informed M. Soheily (though he subsequently induced the Prime Minister to deny this in the press) that M. Stalin would be present. The Shah is said to have been greatly flattered by this “courtesy” on the part of Stalin. Security for the British and Soviet representatives was easy to ensure, since the two missions, each of which is surrounded by a high wall, are separated only by a street, which was blocked so as to cover the connecting-gates. To ensure the safety of Mr. Roosevelt was more difficult, as the American Legation is half a mile away from the Soviet Embassy, in which, it being the senior of the three missions, the meetings of the conference were necessarily held. After first having quarters arranged for him in His Majesty’s Legation and then establishing himself in the American Legation, Mr. Roosevelt finally moved into a house in the compound of the Soviet Embassy. He revealed to the press in the United States that he did this on being informed by Marshal Stalin that there was a plot against the lives of the three chief representatives and that there were in Tehran over. 100 German agents. The publication of this report annoyed the Persian Govern ment, who rightly considered that it gave a false picture of conditions in their capital. They published a dementi, in which they rightly pointed out that during the conference none of the Allied authorities had said anything about the plot to the Persian authorities, who had, in fact, been* thanked by them for the security measures taken. His Majesty’s Legation are convinced that, if the tale was not made up to induce the President to leave his own mission for that of the Soviets, it was invented by the Soviet security authorities to show that it is not only the British -security authorities who can discover plots. The latter, it is true, discovered not only a plot but the plotters as well, but you can’t always have everything. 3. At the Moscow Conference the British and American representatives had made a great effort to secure agreement on the issue of a declaration which would reassure Persia as to the intentions of the Allies, but it was wrecked by the determined opposition of the Soviet delegates. This became known to the Shah and the Prime Minister apparently through the Americans here, who, however, also stated that in the course of the conference the Russians had made known their intention to.remove their troops after the war in accordance with the terms of the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of January 1942. On the 29th November, when Mr. Eden called on the Prime Minister, M. Soheily stated fiECa. K. « [50-50] yj:. NDIA OFFICI / %r** / *T — jl 1 i2 that Tehran was expecting that some communique relating to Persia would appear as a result of the conference. The communique, he suggested, should ( 1 ) recognise that Persia had done her best to help the Allies; ( 2 ) confirm the assurances in the Tripartite Treaty of January 1942 as to the integrity and independence of Persia; and (3) say something about economic assistance. A similar appeal was made by the Shah when Mr. Churchill called on him. The Persians already knew that the British and the Americans were both sympatheti(&gt;^s and that all they had to do was to secure the assent of the Russians. In tht cordial atmosphere of the conference this assent was obtained, and a declaration embodying the three points was eventually issued. This declaration gave the i greatest satisfaction to the Shah, the Persian Government and the Persian people, who seemed to attach almost as much importance to the recognition of their services (mainly afforded grudgingly under pressure) and their sufferings (largely the result of Persian incompetence and venality) as to the renewed guarantee by the British and Russians of Persian territorial integrity and political indepen dence and its endorsement by the Americans, though there was certainly a feeling of relief that the Allies, who had been half expected to “ carve up ” Persia, should have, on the contrary, given the most specific assurances to the contrary. 4. It was agreed that the declaration about Persia should be published at the same time as the main declaration drawn up at the conference, viz., 2000 hours Moscow time (2030 hours Tehran time) on the 6 th December, and every copy held by the Allies, whether in English or in Russian, was headed by a warning in that sense. In the event, a Persian translation of the declaration appeared early on the morning of the 5th December in the Persian newspaper, Friend of Persia, which is published by the Soviet Embassy. The embassy, who failed to inform either the British or the United States Legation beforehand, declared that publication was forced upon them by the news that the Persian Government were about to issue the declaration. This is untrue. On the 4th December the Soviet Charge d’Affaires informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he intended to publish the declaration next day, promised at least to delay the appearance of the Soviet newspaper until midday to give the Government time to announce the declaration at a meeting of Ministers, Deputies and officials at 1030, and then had the newspaper in the hands of the public by 0900 o’clock. This piece of sharp practice was presumably intended to counteract the general impression that the Russians, and the Russians alone, had been opposed to the issue of the declaration. 5. The Shah had wished to entertain the three delegations as guests of the State and had offered three palaces for the purpose, and he was rather ruffled that the demands of security made it impossible for the offer to be accepted. The success of the conference from the Persian point of view dissipated this feeling, but he felt some resentment that he was only able to see President Roosevelt by calling on him in the Soviet Embassy, and he was therefore the more flattered when Stalin paid him a visit at his palace and talked to him for over an hour. Fortunately, Mr. Churchill’s long talk with the Shah as long ago as September 1942 and Mr. Eden’s talk with him in October 1943 gave us a long priority, but, on the other hand, the Shah found a particular pleasure in his interview with Marshal Stalin, partly because if the Russian bear purrs instead of growling the Persian is always ravished with relief, and partly because of the sympathy which the Shah thought he found in Marshal Stalin for his personal ambitions. According to reliable reports from persons to whom the Shah spoke about the interview, the Shah claims that Stalin advised him to keep a strong hold over his people and to maintain a strong army to defend his country’s independence, and offered to give him twenty tanks and twenty aeroplanes and to lend him officers to teach the Persians how to use them. The Shah seems to have taken all this at its face value. A more sceptical listener would have said to himself that, if the Russians had tanks and aircraft to spare, they might reduce by that number their demands on Great Britain and the United States; that for tlie only kind of warfare that the Persian army has to face, viz., the suppression of tribal disorder, there is no need for tanks, of which, indeed, Persia already possesses 100 ; that the despatch by the Russians of a military mission with the promised tanks and aircraft would cut across the scheme for the reorganisation of the army by American advisers and also to some extent the practice by which Persia has looked to Great Britain (and not in vain) for aircraft and for assistance in the training of pilots; and, finally, that there is something phoney, i.e., “ funny peculiar,” about advice in favour of strong personal rule and a large army from a ruler whose local embassy is openly backing the Tudeh party, whose members are violently opposed to both.6 . The declaration about Persia gave a fillip to the reputation of the Shah as well as to that of M. Soheily. It is natural that the Prime Minister in power at the time should share in the glory. The attribution to the Shah of a share in the success is perhaps due to a communique by His Majesty’s Legation devised in the first place to silence malicious rumours that Mr. Churchill had not called on the Shah. It stated that “ it could now be revealed ” that Mr. Churchill had galled on the Shah in September 1942 and had a long and friendly conversation /ith him about the war and interests of Persia; similarly, Mr. Lden, who had had discussions with the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs on his way to the Moscow Conference, had also been received in audience by the Shah, who during the course of the conversation spoke of the expectations and interests of his country. Let us hope that this revelation of the Shah’s influence will not increase his determination to run the country himself. Like his talks with parties of Deputies at the time of the Millspaugh crisis, it should rather remind him of the considerable influence he can exert by constitutional means. The short cut to the perfect State must, however, be very attractive to the son of Reza Shah. A worshipper of his father, the Shah does not realise that, whatever the people of Persia want, they do not want a dictatorship resting on the hated j army, and if he fails to take that into account he will fall into difficulties. He i probably feels that, like his father, he can rule the army and through the army the country; but his practice of suspecting the honest critic and encouraging the flatterer, however corrupt, is discouraging to the well-wishers of Persia, and he has not yet shown the strength of character which he will need if he is to be the master of the army and not its tool. 7. The 69th birthday of Mr. Churchill was celebrated by a dinner which he gave in His Majesty’s Legation on the 30th November. Mr. Roosevelt and Marshal Stalin were present with the leading members of their conference staffs— but without the diplomatic representatives of their respective countries. The occasion was remarkable, in particular for the geniality of Marshal Stalin and his tributes to Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill, especially to the latter, his “ fighting friend.” In the interests of history it is worth while to record this short conversation which occurred before dinner :— Voroshilov : “ Whose portrait is that ? ” His Majesty’s Minister : “ Our King, George V.” Voroshilov: “He’s very much like Nicholas II.” His Majesty’s Minister: “Yes, they were cousins and much alike, though not in character.” Stalin : “ No, indeed. Your King even allowed us to hold our conference in London in 1907.” (This was, of course, King Edward VII, but never mind.) His Majesty’s Minister : “ Were you in London in 1907 ? ” Stalin : “ Yes, I lived in Whitechapel.” It would be interesting to know whether this statement is true or merely part of the Stalin legend which is being built up. The general belief is that Stalin never left Russia before the revolution except perhaps to slip over the border into Persian Azerbaijan when things became too hot for him in the Caucasus in 1905. A remark which Voroshilov made at dinner may also be recorded. After the speech in which Mr. Churchill proposed the health of Marshal Stalin, Voroshilov said to me, pointing across the table at his chief : “ And in the civil war he was my commissar.” This was said not enviously but thoughtfully. Perhaps Voroshilov was thinking of the official school of Soviet historians, which is doing its best to prove that Trotsky played an insignificant part in the civil war as compared with the cardinal role of Stalin. 8 . Carried away by enthusiasm after the conference, the Tehran municipality decided to give the names Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin to three streets in the capital. The idea was good, but the choice of streets was bound to cause trouble. “ Churchill ” Street is a main thoroughfare running between two important avenues, the Firdausi (in front of His Majesty’s Legation) and the Pahlevi, whereas “ Stalin ” Street is a minor thoroughfare to the north of the Soviet Embassy, with no outlet on the Firdausi except a narrow lane. Moreover, “ Churchill ” Street serves the two main gates of the Soviet Embassy, but only the back door of the British Legation. His Majesty's Legation, therefore, kept quiet awaiting developments. The Soviet Embassy have protested, and the Persian Government are trying to fit them out with a street that will satisfy them. They have found one which is suitable as to position and importance, but the embassy want a longer stretch than is offered them, regardless of the fact that this would [50—50] b 24 eat up Raphael Street, which was so named as a fair swap for a Firdausi Street in Rome. The Persian Government are now saying that, if no agreement is arrived at on this point, no individual names will he given, hut to satisfy everyone “ Churchill Street ’’ will be called “ Tehran Conference Street.” There is also a plan to erect a monument in the Shah Reza Avenue to the north of the Soviet and British Missions, with a suitable inscription. M. Soheily, peeping out of perhaps the last wisp of the cloud of glory which he trails, wants to say it witR angels. His Majesty s Legation will do their best to see that the monument, u built, shall be as worthy of the occasion as is possible, for if some of the Persian suggestions are carried out, the monument will be a serious rival to a plaster nvmph-and-champigon monstrosity near by, which serves as a landmark to the British community under the name of the “ Slut and Mushroom.” Visit of President Penes. 9. Dr. Benes, President of the Czechoslovak Republic, stayed in Tehran for two days on his way back from Moscow to London. He was the guest of the Shah and the object of a display of official regard which is attributed partly to gratitude for the services to Persia which Dr. Benes is supposed by Persians to have performed when appointed arbitrator by the League of Nations in the Anglo- Persian dispute about the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and partly to a desire on the part of the Persians to show that they know how to treat State visitors when they are not frustrated as they think they were at the time of the recent conference. Dr. Benes was given an honorary degree, and was feted at a dinner at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at which the Shah and the Queen were present. He made a good impression, and his visit may well have served a cause which he and other Czechs have much in mind, viz., the consolidation of the position of Skoda and other Czech enterprises in this country against the day of material development which is expected to set in after the war. Internal Affairs. 10. The 13th Majlis came to an end on the 23rd November, 1943, in a torrent of insincere oratory. The Prime Minister and others pointed out that not only had the treaty of alliance with the Allies been signed during the 13th legislative assembly’s period, but war had also been declared on Germany. The speakers omitted to mention the failure of the Majlis to deal with the major administrative problems of the country, nor the fact that so many of its members 'were greedy hoarders. The aged President of the Majlis, Hassan Isfandiary, was voted a life pension of 10,000 rials per month. 11 . Taking advantage of the fact that the 13th Majlis had come to an end and that the 14th would not be convened for some time, the Shah forced a reconstruction of the Cabinet upon the Prime Minister. M. Soheily and the members of his Cabinet resigned on the 14th December and a new Cabinet, more satisfactory to the Shah, was formed the next day. The members of the new Government are :— Ali Soheily : Prime Minister. Muhammad SaTd Maragha’i : Foreign Minister. Amanullah Ardalan : Minister of Finance. Muhsin Sadr : Minister of Justice. Hamid Sayyah : Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Dr. Isa Sadiq : Minister of Education. Mustafa Adi: Minister of State. Abdul Hussein Hajhir : Minister of the Interior. Nasrullah Intizam : Minister of Communications. Nuri Isfandiari: Minister of Agriculture. Ibrahim Zand : Minister of War. Brigadier Ismail Shafa’i: Minister of Commerce and Industry. Dr. Ghani : Minister of Health. M. Hajhir is still in London, so the Prime Minister keeps the Ministry of the Interior in his own hands. Four of the Ministers have never held Cabinet office before, viz., Nuri Isfandiari, a professional diplomat; Zand, military cadet (in Russia), lawyer, banker, and more recently comptroller of the Shah’s finances; Dr. Ghani, a savant rather than a doctor and certainly no administrator; and General Shafa’i, manager of the madhine-gun factory that is now making machine-pistols for the Russians. The Shah’s main object was to get rid of Ahmedi and to replace him by one of his own men and so be able to run the army himself. It was suspected at the time that a desire to please the Russians5 by getting rid of Ahmedi and also of Tadayyun played a considerable part in the reconstruction of the Government, and this suspicion has been confirmed by the Soviet Consul-General who informed His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz that the removal of these two Ministers was decided upon during Marshal Stalin’s visit because they were not favourably disposed towards the Soviet Union. The Shah, too, may have been eager to act at once on the advice which ^^e says he received, from Marshal Stalin, to govern with a firm hand. /&gt; 12. My advice to the Prime Minister, who asked for my views beforehand, was to wait until the new Majlis assembled, and not to reconstruct the Cabinet in the interregnum and thereby arouse strong criticism and perhaps cause a barren constitutional struggle. It was not, I said, that I had ever held a high opinion of the Majlis; but a new House had been elected, and now that the major difficulties in the supply of currency, the income tax and foreign policy had been got out of the way, the Majlis would have an easier task, and it would be better to give the Deputies a chance to behave reasonably. The Prime Minister affected to agree, but it is unlikely that he offered serious resistance to the Shah’s resolve to get in his own nominees. The Shah is perhaps regretting already that he acted hastily, for one of his proteges is already in trouble. The • workmen of the Saltanatabad powder factory made a demonstration, demanding that increases in wages should be granted to workmen in State factories such as had already been accorded to officials. It appears that the new Minister of Commerce and Industry, General Shafa’i, who went to the factory to try to settle the dispute, lost his head and fired a revolver, and that a bullet hit the ground and killed one of the workmen by a ricochet. It should have been quite easy to hold an enquiry and exonerate Shafa’i, who perhaps had some justifica tion for firing a warning shot; but Shafa’i was foolish enough to deny that he had fired at all, and the Shah, in a panic lest blame should fall on himself, who had pushed Shafa'i into the Cabinet, has tried to suppress or to rig the enquiry. 13. There being no Majlis to which to present the Cabinet, Soheily contented himself with making a short statement instead of publishing the 4 usual formal programme. The statement said that as foreign affairs were now established on a firm basis, the Government hoped to pay more attention to home affairs; all were invited to assist the Government, especially the press. There will certainly be questions in the Majlis, when it meets, about Shafa’i and the man who was killed, and it does not at present seem likely that a Cabinet which includes Shafa’i will be approved by the Majlis, which may also interest itself in the obvious attempt of the Shah to run the army. The 'date of the opening of the Majlis has been officially given as the 22nd January, but none of the ov ^ preliminary steps to that end have been taken and there are signs that attempts will be made from above to postpone the opening still longer. When it is remembered that the Deputy’s pay does not begin to run until the new Majlis has met and his credentials have been verified, the opposition to any attempt to postpone the opening of the Majlis can be easily calculated. 14. Not much progress has been made in the elections, except those of Tehran, which came to an end on the 28th December, after a good deal of confused electioneering, in which the most vocal agents were those of the Tudeh party. The intervention of the municipality was denounced by the Govern ment and the president of the municipality, Fazlullah Bahramy, and his assistant, Usanlou, were suspended from their functions until the 3 rd January, by which time the voting was finished. The Tehran votes have not yet been fully counted, but a disturbing feature of the .votes which have so far been counted is that the pro-German mulla, Abul-Qasim Kashani, wanted by us for fifth-column activities, occupies quite a high place in the list. Dr. Matin Daftary, arrested at the instigation of the Russians, is also in the running. t Elsewhere, particularly in Azerbaijan, and in Ears, the elections are mostly in suspense. Enough Deputies have been elected to form the quorum of sixty-nine sufficient for the opening of the new assembly, but not more than sixty-two have * yet reached Tehran. 15. There are definite signs that the Russians are taking a much greater interest in the elections in the northern area. It appears that Kambakhsh. the Communist, is after all going to be returned for Kazvin; Parvin Gunabadi for Sabzevar; Iraj Iskandari for Sari, and perhaps two or three similar representa tives of the extreme left for Tabriz. Dr. Radmanish and Dr. Kishavarz both active members of the Tudeh party, have already been elected for Lahijan and Pahlevi respectively. The Soviet Charge d’Affaires, M. Maximov, appears to have adroitly obtained the election of most of these candidates by various manipulations. The Shah is taking an active interest in the elections also; his candidate at Bandar Abbas, Dr. Misbahzadeh, is being supported by certain officials6 /0\ and olBcers under royal instructions, and other candidates, such as Sheikh Ali Dashti, are evidently being backed by His Majesty. Seyyid Zia has had a two hours’ interview with the Shah at which there was some plain speaking. It appears possible that Seyyid Zia will be one of the candidates for* the presidency of the Majlis, but his insistence on retaining his old-fashioned, un-European sheepskin hat, and his unyielding attitude on other points, have alienated some of his erstwhile supporters; he seems to have very definite ideas^-, but the definiteness seems to merge into an obstinacy which some find irritating* Tribal Situation. 16. There is little change since my last despatch. In Ears the Germans are still at large; the Qashgai remain in possession of the arms taken from the Persian forces; and the Government has done little or nothing to increase its own prestige or to persuade any of the tribes that any advantage is to be gained by loyalty to the Government. There is little reason to hope that by the time of the spring migration the Government will have established any authority over the Qashgai tribes or that its forces will be able to suppress the lawlessness that is liable to accompany the migration and to continue through the summer if unchecked. The only alternative open to the Government may be to give more open recognition to Nasir and Khosrow Qashgai as the leaders of the tribe and to charge them with the responsibility for maintaining order—a responsibility which they would be willing to accept on their own terms. The result would inevitably be to increase greatly the difficulty of the task of disarming the tribes which the Government must eventually undertake if peace is ever to rest on a stable basis. The situation is causing some concern to the Shah and some members of the Government, and this may result in some restriction on General Jahanbani’s easy-going policy of appeasement. But the Government is far from being in a position to dictate terms to the Qashgai and Boir Ahmadi leaders. 17. The operations that were to have been undertaken against the Taiyyibi and Bahmai tribes of Kuh-i-Galu have been virtually cancelled. General Amir Ahmedi, before he was dropped from the Cabinet, discovered circumstances that necessitated a modification of his original plans, and it is now unlikely that even the modified plans will be put into effect, although some show of force may be made to induce the tribal leaders to surrender sufficient arms to save the Government’s face. Security. 18. The tussle regarding the handing over to the Russians of the suspects detained at Sultanabad, who are on the Russian list, continued during the period under review. As foreshadowed in my despatch under reference, the Soviet Charge d’Affaires wrote to me agreeing with my proposal that these suspects should be released unless the Soviet authorities either took part in their inter rogation or took them over for such action as they might think fit, but he asked that their release should be once again postponed. He added, orally, that the reason why the Soviet authorities could not take over their suspects was the slackness of the Persian Governor at Resht, who was supposed to be preparing accommodation for the suspects. In my reply I said that I agreed to a postponement until the 2nd December, but that it was contrary to the terms of the British agreement with the Persian Government regarding the arrest of these suspects that we should detain any against whom we had no evidence, so we could not wait indefinitely. * The Tehran Conference caused a further delay, but the Soviet Embassy expressed willingness to take over their suspects on or after the 8 th December. 19. Early in December the British security officials decided that the evidence against some of the suspects on our list was not serious and I therefore suggested that any who would probably qualify for release shortly should be released at once, both as means of calming the rest and because I was not sure that the Soviet security authorities might not make a magnificent gesture— perhaps to signalise the conclusion of the Tehran Conference—and release some or all of the suspects on their list to avoid revealing the fact that the Russian evidence was of the most flimsy character. In their telegram No. 1178 of the 23rd December, the Foreign Office approved—subject to the views of the head of Combined Intelligence Centre, Iraq—the proposal that those Persians should be released whose detention was not considered essential for security reasons. 20 . The position at the end of December was still unsatisfactory. The suspects on the Russian list had not left Sultanabad, their transfer to Resht7 being still the subject of a wrangle between the Russians and the Persian Government as to accommodation, with a more fundamental but at first unacknowledged dispute as to whether the suspects should be transferred at all. The conclusion of the examination by the Anglo-Persian commission revealed to the remaining suspects that they were the prisoners not of the British but of the Russians, and while this diverted criticism from His Majesty’s Govern- ^rient, it also raised such a howl of terror from the suspects affected and from .aeir friends, that the Persian Government eventually instructed their ambassador in Moscow to ask that the suspects should be examined by a Russo- Persian commission at Sultanabad (a procedure which we had always stated our readiness to accept) instead of being sent to Resht in the Russian zone. The delay was so unreasonable that His Majesty’s Minister had to speak to the Prime Minister in the strongest terms, asking why he was so solicitous of the feelings of a group of Persians who are accused of plotting against the Allies and against the State and so indifferent to the interests of His Majesty’s Government, and warning him that the enquiry into the conduct of the suspects on our list would be suspended until the suspects on the Russian list were removed from Sultanabad or their examination at Sultanabad by a Russo-Persian commission began. In point of fact, the examination of evidence by the British security authorities continued, but their projected meeting with the Persian commissioners with a view to the production of a joint report was cancelled and the prospect of release for the less guilty of the suspects was delayed. This does not matter to us now as there no longer seems any risk that the Russians will release their suspects. On the contrary, the Soviet Embassy seems to have become more intransigent though there are indications that it is not the plot against the Allies that 'they are after so much as evidence of Armenian or Caucasian activities. Economics and Finance. 21. There has been no marked improvement in the general economic situation but there are grounds for hope that the collections of cereals and other crops will be in excess of last year. 22 The slight weakening in wholesale prices which was .evident in November was not maintained m the following month. The wholesale orice index, which stood at 669 in October, fell to 651 in November, but rose to 665 ? n ‘ he 2 w d De 1 ceral f r - Similarly, the cost of living index in Tehran fell to T054 in NWrnber, from 1,088 the previous month, only to increase to 1,076 in December The regular arrival of goods by rail from the Persian Gulf ports was largely responsible for the temporary lowering of prices. , ... ( ''[ rr ency notes in circulation rose between the 23rd October and the i December, 1943, by 280-90 million rials to 5,195-07 million rials This compares with a rise of 527 million rials between August and October and although the continued need for “ new money ” must be considered serious this satisfactory.

Stocks are adequate, and purchases ?? alnst quotas m India are proceeding. Merchants, who had tea lying at Nokkundi have now been instructed to rail their stocks to the customs at ZahTdan b\ the 1 st January, 1944 where the Government will take over all tea which is fit for consumption at a fixed price. wmcn 18 25 Stocks of sugar are also adequate. The collection of the sugar beet arvest is proceeding very much more satisfactorily than had been expected animal transport being extensively employed. Up to the 31st December 125 )&lt; o tons of beet had been collected-78,000 tons had. been consumed and 12 500 tons of sugar had been refined. It is hoped to collect another 80,000 or IS WO tons 22hOO tons ^ t0tal Pr0duCti ° n ° f SU - ar for 1943-44 ehmp7ign to ,, 26 ’ T !y s ‘“' k \p cotton piece-goods held in the country by the Iranian Government Cotton Monopoly are given as 28,520 bales. It is probable, however,8 that private merchants have an equal amount in shops, stores and custom houses. The Iranian cotton crop is now being gathered, hut it is not yet possible to say what the total collected will amount to. There are no indications than any pest or other harmful influence has reduced the estimated yield, and a figure of approximately 14,000 tons of ginned cotton is expected. 27. Stocks of oil in Tehran on the 31st December were as follows : — Benzine Kerosene Gas Oil Fuel Oil Days. 36-8 47-6 31-3 30-5 28. During the month the Persian Government were able to supply detailed inventories of stocks held at Gulf ports. These will greatly assist the Allied supply authorities in Persia, particularly in regard to granting of future supplies for Persia by the supply authorities in London and Washington, who havfc hitherto been reluctant to commit themselves to forward planning without knowing exactly what stocks were lying at Persian ports. 29. The question of supplying ships’ bunkers in the Persian Gulf area with North Persian coal is once again being re-examined. This time the examination is being carried out, at our request, by the American military authorities, with a view to obviating the political difficulties which prevented any progress being made when the project was first attempted over a year ago. Supplies of pit timber are now adequate, and good stocks of coal are to he had at the majority of pit-heads. The main difficulty, however, is still transport. 30. On the 31st December contracts had been made for 326,859 tons of food supplies, of which 230,691 tons of cereals had been collected. In comparison with the previous month, contracts and undertakings showed an increase of 52,856 tons, and collections an increase of 90,268 tons. The present stocks in the Tehran silo amounted to 16,507 on that date, although almost 10,000 tons of this were adulterants. Collections in the northern zone have now started, and about 9,000 tons have been received out of the 40,000 tons promised, while the transport of grain from the southern zone is proceeding satisfactorily. 31. Most of the grain from the north has come from Gurgan. Only a small quantity has been received from Khorassan, where the Governor-General and the Finance Department are evidently playing a double game. Tabriz results are even more disappointing; not one ton has been sent from there to Tehran. The Soviet Embassy profess to be concerned and complain about the slackness of the officials, but it is impossible to believe in the sincerity of their professions, especially when one remembers how last year the Soviet Government, without warning to its Allies, produced 25,000 tons of wheat for Tehran at the moment when the delivery of wheat from North America had begun to relieve the shortage of bread and to improve its quality. 32. Road transport and the collection of cereals were the two main problems engaging the attention of the authorities in Persia during December. Several officials, both British and American, whose task it will he 'to assist in solving these two problems, arriving in Tehran during the month. The collection of grain continues fairly satisfactorily, and is being materially assisted through the supply of trucks by the British military authorities. 33. During the month negotiations were begun about the procurement of the 1944 paper requirements for Persia from the United States. No final decisions have yet been reached, but the possibility of part of the paper supplies being imported by reliable importers on behalf of the Government is beino' considered. Transport. 34. The targets for rail allocations for December were 6,000 tons of civil goods from the south and 9,600 tons of cereals from Sultanabad and other near-by stations. Against these target figures, approximately 4,000 tons of goods were moved from the south, and 7,400 tons of cereals from intermediate stations. The total Aid-to-Russia tonnage carried during November (i.e., latest available figures), excluding the East Persia route, was :— Tons daily. Rail 4,920 Road 3,034 or about 239,000 tons a month.[50—50] c 9 Industry. 35. Mining and industrial enterprises in general continue to suffer from the shortage of road transport, which is undoubtedly having a restricting effect on both Government and private enterprises. There has also been a very noticeable tendency towards labour unrest in various factories throughout the country. A further cause for disquiet is the acute shortage of sulphur. There has been no production of this important raw material for the last five months and one factory, aie Parchin Acid Factory, has been closed down in consequence, while the shortage of sulphuric acid is gradually making itself felt throughout the majority of the main Persian industries. The sulphur mine at Semnan has now been restarted, but to date it has only produced half a ton per day, instead of the five or six tons which is necessary. 36. The sardine factory at Bandar Abbas is in full production, and the problem now is that of maintaining an adequate supply of olive oil and of trans porting the output. Imports and Exports. 37. The latest available official figures for imports and exports are for the month from the 22 nd April to the 22nd May, 1943. They show that imports totalled 95 1 million rials, or 7,023 tons (exclusive of duty-free goods); and that imports admitted in franchise at Customs amounted to 68-1 million rials, or 7,205 tons. The total exports for the same period, exclusive of oil, were 55-8 million rials, or 11.329 tons. Anti-Locust Campaign. 38. There has been quite a substantial change in the locust situation. In the summer an international conference in Tehran decided to set up defence in South-East Persia against swarms from India. It has now transpired, however, that very few swarms are likely to emanate from that quarter, and that the invasion is most likely to come from Arabia. The British anti-locust units between Task and Lingeli will probably have a hard campaign ahead, as the swarms from Arabia will be more difficult to kill by contact dust from aeroplanes since they are expected to enter on a wide front. Persian Army. 39. In the reshuffle of the Cabinet General Amir Ahmedi was dropped from the Ministry for War and replaced by the Shah’s nominee, a civilian official of his court, Ibrahim Zand. During his tour of office General Ahmedi had given to us whole-blearted, if not always effective, co-operation, and to the American Military Mission a measure of support with which General Ridley was well satisfied. Thereby he incurred the hostility of the Russians, and by his energetic, if not always tactful, exercise of authority over the army he aroused the suspicion and jealousv of the Shah, who accused him of attempting to be commander-in- chief as well as Minister for War. The Shah does not weaken in his determination to be the effective commander of the army and to allow no authority to be established there that is not completely subservient to himself. In this, as has • been mentioned above, he claims to have found encouragement in his private interview with Marshal Stalin. The Shah is now acting as the commander of the army. He issues orders direct to the Chief of Staff without reference to the Minister for War, and to the Minister for War and even to individual officers through his military secretary. It is the Shah’s desire that the General Staff should again be independent of the Ministry for War and that the functions of the latter should be limited to supply and administration. 40. On the other hand, the Shah, according to General Ridley, has recently shown a more sympathetic attitude towards the American Military Mission and has insisted that an urgent request should be sent to the American Government for at least nine more officers. I fear that this enthusiasm for the American mission is inspired mainly by the Shah’s realisation of the fact that equipment and supplies for the army are not likely to be forthcoming from America unless it is evident to the British and American authorities that the American advisers are being given support in their task. In the decree he recently signed defining the duties and responsibilities of General Ridley and the officers of his mission he was, however, careful to limit their functions to the giving of advice in matters of administration without investing them with any authority to ensure compliance with that advice.10 &lt;n ? &gt; # « 4 * 41. The central administrative and recruit training depots, which are an essential part of the scheme of administrative reorganisation, have now been established at each of the divisional headquarters outside the Russian zone of occupation, with an American officer in an advisory capacity to every two depots. They are, as was to be expected, meeting with much obstruction from divisional commanders, since matters of supply and finance, from which they have been accustomed to derive considerable profits, have now been taken out of their handjs. and centralised in the administrative depots. In the face of this obstruction is not surprising that General Ridley’s administrative reforms have not yet shown convincingly good results. Persian Gendarmerie. 42. Colonel Schwarzkopf has been given in the gendarmerie a position of greater authority than has General Ridley in the army, and he appears to intend to exploit it to the full. He may come into conflict with the Shah, since all present gendarmerie officers hold army commissions from the Shah, who wishes to retain their undivided loyalty and arrogates to himself alone the right of making promotions. Colonel Schwarzkopf is also likely to find that financial stringency, to which he appears to have given little consideration, may impose important restrictions on the plans he has in mind, but to which no visible effect has yet been given. Persian Air Force. 43. The reorganisation of the Persian Air Force continues, particularly in the maintenance and supply branches. Lieutenant-Colonel Si ah Poqsh, previously liaison officer with the Royal Air Force at Doshan iappeh, is being recalled to take charge of these activities, and has with this in view paid a visit to the appropriate Royal Air Force establishments in the Middle Last. ^ An R.A.F. officer has meanwhile been advising the Persians in Tehran. This assistance has been valuable and the Persians have expresst'd appieciatiqn of it. The adaptation of the Persian Air Force to something more like Royal Air Force procedure should not only increase the serviceability of their aircraft but m^ke easier and more economical the supply to them of the British material on which they mainly rely. „ ^ . . „ , „ 44. Colonel Stodakh, who is designated for the post of Chief of the 1 ersian Air Staff, has also been on attachment to the Royal Air Force in Egypt, East Africa and Aden, and is about to attend the next course at the Middle East Staff College. „ 45 . The offer of His Majesty s Government to supply Anson aircraft to the Persian Air Force as alternatives to Hurricanes or Oxfords has been accepted. The type is generally considered to be the best for the Persians pieseiit requirements. Press. 46 After bearing with patience the restrictions which were placed on it during’ the conference, the Tehran press, as soon as it was allowed to do so, expressed great satisfaction that the conference had been held m Tehran and that it had had such a happy outcome for Persia m the form of the Three-Powei Declaration All sections of the press welcomed the declaration and conside e that it clarified Persia’s international position and would leave the Government free to devote its entire energies to the much-needed improvement of internal affairs. Much credit was given to the Shah and to Mr. Soheily for then skilfi conduct ^ al t r h s e Tehran elections consisted mostly of complaints of corruption, Government interference and public apathy The papers of the Left were pessimistic about the results and saw little hope of any real reform as long Ts the present governing classes remained in power. There was increasing emphasis on the need for unity and. personal sacrifice and several papers called for the formation of two or three strong political parties who would put aside private interests and work for the good of the nation. British Council. . . 48 In Tehran teaching of English in the institute, university schools and technical college by British Council staff is limited only by the capacity of the staff lari TTncrlikh is bein 0- indifferently or badly taught by mam private mdivkhials (Persians) in various parts o^ the town and it is obvious that the11 institute must open branches to provide lessons for those who find the main building inaccessible. This cannot be done until more staff are appointed. In the National Bank 400 members of the staff have applied to the Council for English lessons but it is impossible to do more than supervise teaching given by Persians and provide text-books. A British professor was offered to and accepted by the university in December but his arrival has subsequently been cancelled. This is the sixth time during the past year that a professor has been proposed, ^'^xccepted and withdrawn. 49. In Isfahan the new institute was formally opened on the 22nd December. About 250 students are being taught English and 200 have joined as members for club activities only. Lectures, concerts and exhibitions of films are held every week as in the Tehran Institute. English in place of German is now taught in the technical college by the institute staff. 50. In Shiraz all necessary preparations have been made for an institute to be opened. Work will start immediately staff can be found. 51. The institute directors are making regular inspections of secondary schools in Tehran and Isfahan and giving advice on the teaching of English. A new Minister of Education has recently been appointed who desires to promote the British system of education and would gladly accept British teachers in all secondary schools. Advantage of this attitude should be taken while it exists. 52. A lecture was delivered to a large audience of doctors by Dr. Florey, professor of pathology at Oxford, on the new drug penicillin. Miss Irene Ward, M.P., gave lectures and met many Persians in Tehran and Isfahan. Her tour had an excellent effect and similar tours by British visitors would be welcomed. A number of Persians of both sexes have asked to be sent to England for study purposes and the matter is under consideration. 53. The proposed Russian Institute in Tehran, to which reference was made in my despatch under reference, has not yet materialised. 54. I am sending copies of this despatch to the office of the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East, to His Majesty's Ambassador in Moscow, to the Government of India and to all consular officers in Persia.

A. frjasa n ' r despatch AocL, 1 N °- Sir, Tehran, ‘ISrd Novem THE following are the developments in Persia since I wrote No. 393 of the 15th September :— 2 . 'The Soheily Cabinet has remained in office, with no changes of personnel. I he Minister of Roads. Hajir, is still in England, whence he seems in no hurry to return. M. Soheily has managed to survive two major crises : the first being the 4 s&lt;rc|o ^9 interpellation of the Deputy Tehranchi. and the second, the Income Tax Bill./^wv i //-A 0 . 1 he interpellation had been in the air for some time, Tehranchi having been *, 1/ . persuaded to postpone it more''than once. He was supported by a number oi*' disappointed Deputies, who knew that they would in all probability not be re-elected to the 14th Majlis; and the partisans of Seyyid Zia tookMheTOjc* opportunity to do a good deal of lobbying in order to overthrow Soheily on the *1,* vote concerning the interpellation, so that Seyyid Zia might form a Cabinet before^T^r* the Majlis came to an end. The Shah, however, sided with Soheily and against 7 . Seyyid Zia; there seemed no suitable alternative, and Soheily triumphed when the interpellation was finally put to the vote on the 31st October. Since then Seyyid Zia has faded away somewhat, but the closing days of the 13th Majlis have seen a good deal of discussion about Cabinet changes. Soheily himself i^}j^ prepared to revise the personnel of his Cabinet, bringing in new men like Musharraf Naficy and Moosa Noury Esfandiary. The Shah, however, is thinking of a completely new team, without Soheily; only, Ala has refused to be “ considered ” for the premiership, Ali Mansur is in the bad books oL-tini Russians for letting a man they disliked be elected to the Majlis and fof not v 7^- iO- fcf c /. O.o. X pushing in one or two of their nominees, and the Shah has realised that would not do. The Shah is now thinking of Hajir as a possible Prime Min ster &amp; Q Hajir is able and apparently honest, but he is very young, and that means tblkt he p / Q has as yet no following. ' i G u O 3. The elections have taken their course, and results have been annoiinced from a number of constituencies. About sixty-five Deputies had been elected bvQ^ a the 20 th November, with some more results expected very soon, so thai t hiA ' - necessary number of Deputies to secure the reopening of the new Majlis, viz., sixty-nine, should have been elected by now (the 2 |rd November). There ought, therefore, to be no need of an interval between the expiry of the present CvLp i # Chamber on the 24th November and the opening of the new one. Nevertheless, it is thought likely that the results of the Tehran, and possibly of the Tabriz, . ! [1 'J elections will be awaited before the new Majlis is convened, and. as voting has not * '- ‘4 yet commenced in either of those places, it seems likely that the new Majlis will not be summoned for some weeks. An opportunity would thus be afforded for a Government to rule without any interference from Deputies. Hence the Shah’s wish to form a new Cabinet under a Prime Minister of his own choosing. 4. The bogy of Russian intervention in the elections in the north has proved to be a very small one. In only two of the constituencies have Communists, or persons holding views similar to communism, been elected, one being Darajez on the Russian frontier in Khorassan. where a certain Durri was elected; the other being Pahlevi, the Caspian port, where Dr. Feridun Kishavarz was successful. At Resht the Russians acquiesced in, or at any rate did not prevent, the election of Abol Ghassim Amini, who when in Government service was almost certainly guilty -of peculation on a large scale; he is member of a family of wealthy reactionaries, and his newspaper, Umid, published severe criticisms of Dr. Millspaugh. In Sarab, where the prince-landowner Muhammad Vali Farman- Farmayan was thought to be in danger of defeat by a Russian nominee, the prince was elected almost unanimously. In Kazvin the Communist candidate, Abdui Samad Kambakhsh, was not successful, nor was a similar candidate in Talish, near the Russian frontier at Astara. In the south some unexpected results have f irieScs* [48—51] ♦L. ' * /vWsbeen announced, and it has frequently happened that the views of the Govern ment about the suitability of a candidate have not been effective in securing on preventing his election; in fact, provincial Governors have usually shown themselves unable, or unwilling, to secure the election of the Deputies recom mended by the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior. 5. The Majlis showed its usual lethargy and obstructiveness, except when presented with an ultimatum to resign from Dr. Millspaugh in connexion with the Income Tax Bill. (For details of incident see paragraph 23.) They, however, passed Bills authorising the selection of 60 American advisers, the engagement of two Americans for service as director-general in the Ministry of Health and managing director of the Pharmaceutical Institute, and the minting of coins of silver alloy. . Tribal Situation. Ga) South Persia. 6 . In Pars the Persian Government have drifted into a policy of appease ment of the Qashgai tribes. It will be remembered that in their panic after the disaster to the Persian troops at Semirum in July they appointed Qavam ul Mulk to be Governor-General of Pars, with the intention that he should rally to the side of the Government certain tribes over whom he had influence with a view to reducing the power of Nasir Qashgai to an extent which would justify his being attacked by these tribes with the doubtful support of the Persian forces. How ever,’ as reported in my despatch under reference, the policy of appeasement had been begun by the military commander in Pars before Qavam ul Mulk reached Shiraz. Nasir’s brother, Khosrow, came to Tehran, made promises of good behaviour, and undertook to return the arms of the Persian troops taken by the Qashgai and to arrest and surrender any Germans in Qashgai territory. In return the Government agreed to appoint him to be Governor of Firuzabad, to deal with the Qashgai tribes through him and not to oppose the election of Nasir Qashgai as a Deputy for Firuzabad. It must be said that there was an imme diate improvement in the behaviour of the Qashgai tribes, which has been maintained to the present date. Beyond some looting of the villages of neutrals and their enemies there has been little lawlessness that can be definitely attributed to the Qashgai. But only a few arms, and those such as were of little use to the tribes, have been returned, nor have any Germans been arrested, although three or four are known to have been at times in Qashgai territory. 7. The Qavam ul Mulk reached Shiraz to find the military commander already in friendly relations with Nasir and Khosrow, and increasingly reluctant to support the Qavam’s policy of arming and encouraging certain tribes to stand out against the Qashgai. Divergence of views soon led to strained relations. The Minister for War visited Shiraz with the intention of con tinuing the energetic support which he had consistently given to ■Qavam ul Mulk, but, influenced by certain defects of character which Qavam undoubtedly showed in the face of difficulties, and perhaps by other considerations, he came to the conclusion that Qavam could not be relied upon to carry through the policy which had been originally advocated by the Minister himself. Qavam returned to Tehran to seek a decision whether his policy or the military commander’s, which was one of ill-disguised appeasement, should prevail. 8 . The onus of making a decision did in fact devolve upon His Majesty’s Minister. The Minister for War assured me that he was ready to give the Qavam full support if I had sufficient faith in him to insist that he should be allowed to attempt to carry out his policy, but as he made no secret of his own conviction that the Qavam had not the qualities necessary for success, I could not feel confident that this support would be really whole-hearted. His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz had also expressed grave doubts regarding the Qavam’s ability to deal with the many real difficulties facing him. It was generally expected that if he were to begin to put into effect the measures required to build up a combination of tribes hostile to Nasir, the latter would immediately provoke disorder which the Qavam would be unable to control in view of the unreliability of the Persian forces. Inthecircumstanceslcametotheconclusion that the attitude for me to adopt was that it was for the Persian Government to decide what mea sures should be taken to establish their authority in Pars and that I was concerned mainly with the elimination of German and other hostile influences that might be directed towards damaging British interests. I made it plain that I expected the Persian Government to protect Qavam’s prestige and that I would not be satis fied as long as Germans and the Deputy Nowbakht were being given asylum by the tribes of Pars. The plain truth, however, is that, the Qavam having3 V4* &lt;»ct Shtya 1 ) ICiflC* l4fT70ll ^ 0&lt; - 0.-WC.II . proved a disappointment, the Persian Government is for the present in no position to take a strong line against the tribes of the south. 9. The situation at the moment is that the Qavam is still Governor-General of Ears, though he has not returned to Shiraz, that Khosrow Qashgai has given solemn assurances to me that he will hand over the Germans—assurances which I find less reason to believe as time passes—and that the policy of appeasement is being pursued with consistency unusual in a Persian by the military commander of the south. At the same time, most tortuous intrigues, allegedly with the object of setting brother against brother and tribe against tribe are in train, all this with a view to splitting the tribes to such an extent that in the spring they will be unable to combine against disarmament by the Persian forces. But, on the other hand, the two principal tribal chiefs who have been in rebellion against the Government, Nasir Qashgai and Abdullah Zarghampur Boir Ahmad i, are making use of the liberty and the responsibility for the maintenance of order given to them by the Persian authorities to consolidate their position and to obtain the adherence of other tribes who had hitherto remained neutral or had supported the Government. I see little reason to hope that in the spring the ! relative strength of the Persian forces and the tribes will be more favourable [ to the Government than it is at present. 10 . For the time being there is peace, and that is our principal immediate consideration. There is, I think, good reason to hope that in present circum stances no responsible tribal chief will abet any attempt to damage important British interests, such as the oilfields or the railway, but while Germans with money are still in tribal territory there will always be the possibility of their collecting a band of malcontents to assist them in sabotage. It is known that three Germans are now with the Boir Ahmadi tribe, and until they are apprehended there will be cause for anxiety. 11 . The Persian Government intend shortly to carry out operations for the disarmament of certain small tribes living along the eastern flank of the oil-fields —the Taiyyibi, Bahmai and Western Janeki. These tribes inflicted a minor disaster on a garrison of Persian troops at Malamir (Izeh) in March last, for which they have not yet been punished, and they have been a constant cause of disorder, creating anxiety among employees of the oil company. The Persian Government hopes by these operations to re-establish some of their lost prestige in this area. Their troops will be assisted by some Bakhtiari levies. 12. A minor operation is also in progress for the disarmament of the small tribes of Dashti and Tangistan. The Royal Navy assisted with this operation by providing a ship to transport Persian troops from Bushire to Daiyir, enabling them to capture this town, the headquarters of the rebel chief, Ali Ismail, with little or no opposition. 13. In the Kerman Province long overdue operations have been undertaken against the notorious robber, Hussain Buchakchi, 'which resulted in his surrender and the capture of some at least of the arms of his tribe. x (b) Bakhtiari Region. 14. There are certain dissident elements and inter-clan dissensions in Bakhtiari. but on the whole Morteza Quli Khan, the Bakhtiari Governor, appears to be establishing his authority throughout the tribal area. Whether in the long run this will be to the advantage of the Persian Government is problematical, but for the time being there is a greater degree of order in Bakhtiari than has prevailed for some time past. (c) Kurdistan. 15. As is usual when the Kurds are left to themselves there is inter-tribal squabbling leading sometimes to fighting, but in that part of Kurdistan adjacent to British lines of communication the situation is fairly satisfactory, in the Russian zone, where since their occupation the Russians have opposed any inter vention by Persian forces in Kurdish territory, they are now pressing the Persian Government to re-establish gendarmerie garrisons along the Turkish frontier, presumably with the object of preventing the smuggling of food-stuffs from Persia. Security. f 16. Out of the 162 suspects whom the Persian Government were requested on the 29th August to arrest, 138 have been handed over at Sultanabad. The names of ten additional suspects were handed to the Prime Minister on the [48—51] B 24 10 th October, of which eight have been arrested. Df the original 162 names, thirty-five had been proposed by the Russians. We have sufficient evidence of our own against six of these to warrant their being interrogated at Sultanabad, but against the remaining twenty-nine (of w T hom eleven are still at liberty) we have no evidence whatsoever. The Soviet Charge d’Affaires asked the Prime Minister with my support to have eight of the thirty-five sent to Resht for joint Soviet and Persian interrogation, but in regard to the rest of the suspects on their list the Russians were doing nothing, although the Soviet Embassy and the Soviet seem ity authorities have been repeatedly asked to take part in the enquiry at Sultanabad when suspects on their list come up for examination or to produce evidence against them. Finally I wrote to the Soviet Charge d Affaires on the 3rd November to the following effect. To bring suspects up for interrogation at Sul tana bad without producing evidence would make a bad impression on the Persian authorities. We had our own evidence against six suspects on the Russian list, and the Soviet authorities were going to interrogate some at Resht. 1 he remainder on the Russian list who were under detention at Sultanabad should, I suggested, be released on the 12 th November unless the Soviet authorities could agree either to take part in their interrogation or take them over for such action as they might think fit. On the 10 th November the Soviet Charg 6 d Affaires promised me to do his best to solve the question to our mutual advantage, and asked me to take no action until the 20 th November. On the 19th November he told me that the Soviet authorities agreed in principle, but wanted a few days’ respite while the necessary premises at Resht were beino a- 0 t ready by the I ersian Governor. I asked him to put this in writing and he said he would do so at once. I have, however, received no such communication at the time of closing this despatch. It is proposed to give M. Maximov a few days and then to inform him that action can no longer beMelaved, since the reputation of His Majesty s Government for judicial fairness cannot be left dependent upon a Persian official, whose zeal His Majesty’s Legation have no means of stimulating. Economic and Financial. / 17. Between the 25th August and the 23rd October, 1943. currency notes in circulation rose by Rials 527 millions to Rials 4,914.17. Allied* military expenditure (still on a substantial scale, though less than a year ago) and Govern ment borrowings to meet the cost of essential services (for example, the purchase ol the wheat crop) have created the need for this 1 new money.” , during the two months the Index of Wholesale Prices in Tehran rose from 600 (23rd August) to 669 (23rd October), and the Cost of Living Index for all Persia from 980 (23rd August) to 1,088 (23rd October). During the last two oi three weeks however, there are signs that bazaar commodity prices are weakening Wholesale prices are tending downwards, although the relief has not yet been felt in the retail markets. To some extent this tendency can be attributed to the growing belief that the end of the war is now not far offhoarders of stocks oi consumers goods are showing a disposition to unload, fearing that the existing stringency in the supply situation may shortly come to an end. 'The arrival in the interior of stocks of consumers’ goods that have lain for months in the Gulf ports has caused some anxiety to the hoarders, and has contributed probably more than anything else to the downward tendency in prices. Approaches have actually been made by more than one prominent Tehran merchant to the British officer iii cml movements at Ahwaz, begging him not to display too much zeal in the discharge of his duties. Moreover, goods are now being railed up with increasing promptness and regularity at the recognised tariff rates, instead of having, as hitherto, to incur the exorbitant black-market charges for transport by road or to pay heavy bribes to Persian railway officials for priority. P . 1 . i ' ' hue these signs and tendencies are encouraging, the situation never- heless remains grave, and the internal price level is still to-day probably higher than m any other territory in the Middle East. ' ' tion and M 'nT^^ 00 ' 111 ' 1168 t0 fi ° ht in face of much obstruc tion and with little effective help. His mam general objectives are two: first to make available in the markets such goods as there are in the country and secondly to do what he can to “ mop up ” the supply of excess purchasing power The first is a problem as much of distribution as of supply- and the steps which are being taken are discussed in paragraphs 29 to 33 below P 21 With the second object in view, Dr. Millspaugh many months aim prepared and presented to the Majlis two Bills, one authorising an issue If Treasury Bonds to the amount of 500 million rials, and the other a measure to7 ^' iefoiin the I ei’sian Income lax laws in the direction of exacting an equitable contribution to revenue from the wealthier sections of the community. Both Bills have now reached the Statute Book. Although quite uncontroversial, the Treasury Bonds Bill was not passed by the Majlis until near the end of September. The Bonds have not yet been placed on offer, as the regulations with regard to maturity, rates of interest &amp;e v^re still to be made. j h e Income I ax Bill caused a crisis which all but led to the resignation t&gt;-ii i Ml ! ls P au g h . an d the departure of the American Financial Mission. The i hung in the Financial Commission of the Chamber for many weeks, and went tirough a piocess of emasculation which destroyed much of its original purpose. Finally during the first week of November, it came before the Deputies in full session for enactment. Amendment after amendment was proposed—all directed towards relieving the pockets of the rich from the incidence of the income tax It seemed, indeed, that the purpose of the Deputies was to shelve such an unpopular measure anyhow during their term of office, which would so soon expire Dr. Millspaugh, however, took up the challenge : he decided to make this issue a test of the sincerity and public spirit of the Deputies; and let it be known that unless the Bill was passed (amended only in such respects as he thought reason able) he was not prepared to remain. On the 14th October, he had informed the Covei nment that as the Majlis had not provided me with the means of fulfilling my responsibilities, I considered that my contract had been terminated,” and set the date of his resignation at the 2 nd November. The Shah then let it be known that it was his desire that the two Bills to which Dr. Millspaugh attached primarv importance should be passed, namely, the Income Tax Bill and the Bill providing for the engagement of sixty American advisers. The latter measure was immedf- ?^ e y AT e n aCted V ai 1 ld ne ^tiations with regard to the Income Tax Bill began Dr Millspaugh then undertook, at the urgent request of the Prime Minister to postpone the date of his resignation until the 10 th November, and later he agreed pers K ona ^ equ f 1 ° f Shah ' to a further postponement until the 12 th November On the 11 th November the Deputies capitulated and the Bill was passed. An amended text of the Bill is not vet available. Dr. Millspaugh informs me that, while the measure as finally passed represents a substantial compromise on his original proposals, most of the points of principle on which he stood have been incorporated. I shall report on the measure in a special despatch m due course. ^ a apeemi 24. Dr. Millspaugh has spoken to me with appreciation of the support and encouragement which he obtained during the crisis from the Shah; and His Majesty s Legation has conveyed to His Imperial Majesty the gratification of His Majesty s Government that His Imperial Majesty’s influence was exercised m support of the American Financial Mission, in this difficult situation. ,, ,!e Budget Law for the current financial year has now been passed bv the Majlis. As presented, the budget was divided into two parts— the ordinary budget, showing a deficit of about 1,400 million rials and the extraordina -v budget (covering the industrial and trading operations of the Government? which was self-balancing Dr. Millspaugh had already indicated to the Deputies that he saw no means of meeting the deficit in the ordinary budget extent bv recGursc to foreign financial help; and negotiations were already wellon theway United t ^ 01u ais1011 , of a Stabilisation Fund Agreement between Persia and the Vfn 1 d ii St 1 \ nl n e, i whlc1 ?' 111 effect &gt; Pef sui would obtain a dollar credit of million which she could use as backing for additional issues of currency. T e proposal for foreign help has not, however, commended itself to the patriotic Deputies who decided to produce a balanced budget by including as an item of revenue the value of stocks of commodities held bv’the various Governmen trading organisations at the beginning of the financial year. 26. Dr. Millspaugh is now inclined to take a more optimistic view of the Government s financial situation. Revenue is coming in beyond his expectations and he thinks he can get through the next few months without foreign aid He is unwilling, so soon after surmounting the crisis of the Income Tax Bill to put a second major controversial measure before the Majlis, and accordingly he proposes to postpone for the present negotiations for the conclusion of the stabilisation Fund Agreement. 27. Sales of gold on the open market on behalf of His Majesty’s Govern ment continue. Gold is sold in the form of pahlavis and 5-tola bars. Demand has been we 1 maintained at the present official selling price of 540 rials for the pahlavi and 4.300 rials for the 5-tola bar. Since official sales of British sovereigns have ceased, the bazaar price of these coins has sharply increased.6 On the 18th November the George V sovereign was quoted in the Tehran bazaar at 642 rials, or 100 rials higher than the pahlavi, notwithstanding that the two &lt;x&gt;ins are exactly equivalent in fine-gold content. Between the 25th September and the 11 th November gold sales on behalf of His Majesty’s Government realised 71,636,065 rials, and were made at an average price of 2,211 rials (about £17 5s. sterling) per fine ounce. 28. The Persian Government has now decided to discontinue sales of goP^N on its own account and to leave the field to us. Gold which the Government is purchasing from the United States authorities is being placed in the Currency Reserve in exchange for silver, and the silver is being sold in the open market at a substantial profit on the price at which it stood in the Currency Reserve. Civil Supplies. 29. Since the middle of September the civil supply position has deteriorated, and latent defects have become apparent. This is not the result of any failure on the part of the Anglo-American supply authorities to import enough essential goods, but has been caused by a breakdown of road transport and of the internal distribution of basic commodities. The situation holds the elements of a serious crisis this winter. The road transport situation is dealt with under the relevant section. The commodities essential to maintain the life of the population are cereals, fuel, clothing, sugar, tea and drugs. The supply of cereals and fuel is mainly a road transport problem. That of the other goods is a matter of administration, i.e., the organisation of efficient distribution. Ur. Millspaugh realises the need to concentrate on these essentials, and will be able to devote more of his time to these difficult problems now that the Income Tax Bill crisis has passed. Certain measures to improve the importation and distribution of cotton piece-goods, sugar and tea have already been taken. M. Allageh Saleh, a former Minister of Finance, has been sent to India to supervise purchases of tea. cotton piece-goods and other goods for the Persian Government; and his predecessor, who is said to have devoted his time to private speculations instead of to purchases for his Government, has been recalled. The distribution of drugs has been dealt with by a special sub-committee of the Medical Advisory Committee—an offshoot of the Allied Combined Supplies Committee. The British and American Legations, and other Allied authorities are now helping the Government Drug Monopoly Organisation to compile an inventory of the stocks of drugs in the country and to organise an efficient system of distribution throughout the country. The general untrustworthiness and ineffectiveness of the Persian Government and officials is the chief obstacle to the improvement of the supply position. 30. Pending the arrival of the additional advisers, to make up the sixty mentioned in paragraph 23, the Middle East Supply Centre are lending personnel to Dr. Millspaugh to assist him in dealing with the supply problem. S Transport. The transport by rail of civil goods from the Gulf ports to Tehran has . improved, thanks mainly to the appointment of a British movements officer to the Price Stabilisation Section, who has been able to supervise the loading of civil goods at Khorramshahr and.Ahwaz. During September and October about 5 , 000 - 6,000 tons were despatched each month out of the allocation of 8,000 tons, oil not being included in these figures—the movement of oil by rail was also satisfactory, and adequate stocks have been built up at points on the railway. The arrival of these quantities of civil goods brought down prices in Tehran by about 10 per cent., much to the annoyance of certain merchants (as described in paragraph 18). 31. Road transport became seriously disorganised during the period under review l&gt;ecause of the high rates paid on the “ free ' market and the almost entire absence of police control over civil motor lorries outside Tehran. In an attempt to correct the position the Persian Government Road Transport Department, by agreement with the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and Iransovtrans, raised the rates paid to their contractors; but the new scales are still far below the rates paid for uncontrolled work. New regulations have been published by the Government, laying down stricter penalties for illegal work : and efforts arc being made to devise some effective way to impose these regulations. Millspaugh proposes to set up a new committee to advise on transport matters, comprising members of the British, American and Russian diplomatic missions, the Middle East Supply Centre, Office of the Lease-Lend7 76 -7N Administration, United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, Paiforce, and the other authorities who might be able to contribute towards improving the situation. The existing Koad Transport Board may in consequence disappear. The Road 'transport Department needs further trustworthy staff; and various proposals in this connexion, including the seconding of Middle East Supply Centre personnel to that department, are under consideration. The consequence this disorganisation of civil road transport has been that urgent requests for . 4 elp have had to be sent to Paiforce and to the Government of India to provide transport for the movement of oil and cereals for civil needs. Paiforce have taken over the entire transport of oil for civil needs from Kermanshah to Tabriz; they have provided military vehicles for the movement of grain from Kermanshah to Sultanabad and Tehran; and may also have to assume the entire responsibility for providing transport for the anti-locust campaign. The total number of vehicles involved probably amounts to some 500-600. A similar appeal to the Government of India (who control the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation trucks in the Meshed area) to authorise these trucks to carry oil from Shahroud to Meshed has so far been unsuccessful, though a telegram has now been received from the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation in London granting authority for the purpose. The need for these trucks is urgent, as, unless sufficient stocks of oil for civil consumption are built up now in Khorassan, the bad state of the roads later in the year will make it impossible to supply these t requirements. There will then be much distress amongst the civil population, and the security of this aid-to-Russia route may be disturbed. 32. The shortage of controlled transport has made it virtually impossible for the Government to supply vehicles for the collection of the sugar beet crop of over 200,000 tons. This will probably be lost entirely, except in those areas where the local authorities have diverted trucks for this purpose from the transport of products like grain and fuel, which should have higher priority. 33. Road transport conditions have been extremely unstable during the past year. At one moment they may be satisfactory : a number of privately-owned vehicles may be working more or less satisfactorily for the Government and essential goods may be transported to some extent according to plan. A few days later the situation may have changed : the inducements of the uncontrolled market may have attracted away many of these vehicles : and plans for the movement of vital commodities may be entirely disrupted. Until a proper system of control has been established this threat to the welfare of the country will remain. It is to be hoped therefore that the latest measures of the Persian Government to control civil road transport will be more effective than those hitherto enacted. Cereals. 34. Although the situation is still not free from anxiety, considerable progress has been made in the last two months in collecting the surplus grain required to feed Tehran and the larger provincial towns until the next harvest. Over 150,000 tons of grain, or more than half the total requirements, is now in Government hands, and landlords’ undertakings or contracts have been signed for a further 110,000 tons. 35. The ban on the private purchase and transport of grain has been enforced with some effectiveness in the south and west, particularly in Khuzistan and in the immediate vicinity of Tehran, thus enabling the Government to profit in these areas from this year’s good harvest. In Khuzistan more than 14,000 tons have been collected so far, and cheap ration bread continues to be supplied to the public in Ahwaz and three other towns in the province. In the Tehran area total collections are already in the neighbourhood of 21,000 tons, and are expected to reach a figure of 26.000 tons, as compared with an average of only 11.000 tons for collections during the last four years. 36. Most of the wheat and barley collected in the Tehran area has already been brought in to the capital, where it is consumed as fast as it can be delivered, except for the barley, only 20 to 30 tons of which can be issued every day owing to inadequate milling facilities. No appreciable quantities of grain have yet been brought in from other areas, and stocks in the Tehran silo remain in the neighbourhood of 10,000 tons, of which little more than a third is wheat or wheat flour. 37. The requirements of Tehran from harvest to harvest are approximately 00,000 tons of grain. Allowing for the delivery of 25,000 tons from districts in the Tehran area, the intention is to bring in a further 25,000 tons from other areas in the south and west and 40,000 tons from the northern provinces. Most of the8 25.000 tons expected from the south and west must come from the Sultanabad, Hamadan and Kermanshah districts, and in the course of October some 10,000 tons accumulated in these three districts for transport to Tehran. The surplus from Sultanabad began to be moved to Tehran by rail. Owing to a serious inadequacy of local road transport facilities, however, there appeared to be little prospect of moving any grain from Hamadan and Kermanshah. Arrangements were therefore made at the end of October for British army trucks to move 10,000 toi^ N ol grain in two months from Kermanshah, while the help of the Persian army w;**- enlisted to carry grain from Hamadan. 38. The attitude of the Soviet authorities to the export of the vital grain surplus from the Soviet-occupied zone has recently been clarified, to the extent that they have promised to help in the transfer to Tehran of 40,000 tons of grain, thus formally recognising the capital's dependence on the northern provinces for assistance of this order. Prompted by Dr. Millspaugh after a conference on food supplies at which the American Minister and myself were present, the Persian Prime Minister made representations in October to the Soviet Charge d’Affaires and was successful in obtaining his agreement for the provision of transport facilities, including rail facilities on the north-eastern and north-western lines and road transport from Tabriz to the north-western railhead, for the export of 18.000 tons of grain from Azerbaijan, 2,000 tons from Zinjan, 10,000 tons from Gurgan and 10,000 tons from Khorassan. In return the Russians have been promised 40,000 tons of rice, in exchange for manufactured goods (including 60 per cent, cotton piece-goods) and help in transporting 12,000 tons of rice to Tehran. So far, however, less than 600 tons of wheat and barley have reached Tehran from the northern provinces and how much more will come will depend as much on the actual availability of the necessary surplus as on the readiness of the Russians to supply the transport facilities they have promised. Although the Russians themselves are not asking for any wheat or barley this year, there is little enough prospect at present of any substantial surplus being available for Tehran. Collections in the south are nearly three times those in the northern provinces, where not even half the local requirements are yet in Government hands. The Soviet authorities are understood to have offered to instruct their local officials to assist the Persian grain collecting officials, and a proposal was i made to them in October by the Persian Government for the appointment of Russian “cereals liaison officers” with duties comparable to those of our own “consular liaison officers.” This valuable suggestion, however, has not yet borne fruit. 39. In view of the uncertainty of supplies from the northern provinces, the Middle East Supply Centre, Cairo, has been asked to establish a secret reserve of 10,000 tons of grain at some convenient place outside Persia, to be available at six weeks' call—from the 1st December, as a guarantee against a complete breakdown of the Tehran bread supply such as happened last winter. ^ It is not impossible that a shortage of supplies from the north could be made good to some extent by additional deliveries from districts in the south and west. This will depend, however, partly on sufficient transport being available and partly on the extent to which the Government succeeds in enforcing its theoretical purchasing monopoly. There is the liveliest opposition to this monopoly from landowners, middlemen, and well-to-do householders, who demand a free market for grain regardless of the effect which this would have in impeding the purchases by Government on which the bread of the majority of the population of the towns depend. A campaign in the press and Majlis has compelled Dr. Millspaugh to agree to the issue of permits for the purchase of grain by private individuals, since, without this concession, he could see no prospect of obtaining an essential credit (not, in fact, yet granted) of 40 million rials for further grain purchases. The insertion, however.* in the relevant decree of an ingenious clause providing that grain purchased privately should, nevertheless, be transported by Government, by seriously restricting the scope of private dealings has left the would-be dealers still unsatisfied and the Government still the principal grain purchaser If this situation continues and if the results of the sugar barter scheme, which has been working successfully in Khuzistan and is expected to be introduced generally towards the end of November, are satisfactory, considerable additional surpluses may yet be forthcoming from areas in the southern zone 40. Colonel Speaks arrived in Tehran from the United States towards the end of September, to take over the Cereals and Bread Section from Mr. Crawford, but unfortunately, had to leave again for the United States almost immediately owim- to ill-health. Mr. Crawford, therefore, continues to be in charge, under'''N 11 9 Dr. Millspaugh, of the work of grain collecting. Much of the detailed organisa tion has been entrusted to Lieutenant-Colonel Attaullah, Indian Medical Service, who is rendering invaluable service in supervising the work of provinicial grain collecting centres, implementing the recommendations of our consular liaison officers and helping to plan the day-to-day policy of the Cereals and Bread Section. Persian Army and Gendarmerie. ^a) Army. 41. Although little or no improvement is visible in the Persian forces, some preliminary measures towards reform have been taken. The Majlis has passed Bills authorising the engagement of thirty American military officers as advisers to the Persian army, of eight as advisers to the gendarmerie, and of the American police expert, Timmerman, as director-general of the police. It is understood that the United States Government is unwilling to provide the full number of military officers required. It is certain that no adequate measure of reform can be achieved in any reasonable time with much less than these numbers, and, as the reform of the forces is essential to the stability of Persia, it is to be hoped that the United States Government will be persuaded to extend the limit they have now imposed of eleven officers for the army and three for the gendarmerie. 42. There are now the Minister for War, the Under-Secretary for Mar, and the Chief of the Staff, officers who are not only friendly to us, but are prepared to co-operate loyally with the American advisers. In opposition, however, to the grant of any considerable measure of authority to the American advisers are the Russians, the Shah and certain Persian officers. Ihe Shah not only dislikes to admit that any foreign control is necessary hut fears that the American advisers may strengthen the authority of the Ministry for War over the army to the detriment of his own. He clings hard to his ambition to be commander-in-chief in fact as well as in name. Popular clamour forced him to sign, very reluctantly, a decree making clear that the Minister for M r ar was responsible for the army, subordinating the Chief of the Staff, who had, until then, taken his orders direct from the Shah, to the Minister and limiting his own powers to certain prerogatives of approval, but he has never willingly accepted this position. He has recently appointed to his ^ personal staff two senior officers, General Yazdan Panah as his Aide-de-Camp-General, and General Razmara as Chief of his Military Secretariat, both of whom have recently been Chief of Staff and resigned from that appointment owing to their unwillingness to subordinate themselves to the Minister of War. They are both notoriously hostile to foreign influence in the army. This has led to strained relations between himself and his Minister for War and Chief of Staff, since these officers realise that they have been displaced as the Shah’s military advisers by Generals \azdan Panah and Razmara. Yazdan Panah and Razmara'have some following in the army among those who, for reasons of pride or profit, resent the advent of the American advisers. There is reason to believe that they are supported and encouraged by the Russians, who, for reasons of their own, object to the extension of American influence in Persia. The result of their appointment has been to increase disunion in the army, to dimmish the authority of the Minister for M ar and to incline officers to look more to the Court than to the Ministry and the Chief of Staff. It is natural to see a close connexion between this renewed attempt by the Shah to control the army and his desire, to which reference was made in the second paragraph of this report, to set up a Cabinet of his own choosing in the interval between the dissolution of the present Majlis and the opening of its successor. 43. The Shah agreed that the Ministry for War should draft regulations to define the functions of his Military Secretariat in consultation with General Ridley and the Belgian Military Attache, the latter, because the Persian Con stitution follows the Belgian to some extent as regards the relation of the Crown to the army. General Ridley has given his opinion in writing that the Shah has no need of a military secretariat except for ceremonial duties. This has not disposed the Shah more kindly to the American advisers, though the Belgian Military Attache is also understood to have said that Belgian experience was against such an institution. 44. General Ridley’s contract has now been drafted by the Ministry for War. It is understood that it gives him satisfactory control over the administra tion of the army and some control over the appointment and promotion of officers [48—51] c10 in administrative services. It has not yet been submitted to the Shah, who is not likely to accept it willingly in its present form. 45. As first step towards reform certain measures have been taken. The useless but costly Staff College has been abolished; some twenty-two officers of the rank of colonel and above, notorious for their inefficiency or corruption, have been put on the retired list; the training of recruits for the troops in the capital has been centralised under American supervision; supply, clothing and pay are also in process of being centralised under American control, but progress is slow, due to the prevailing corruption and the shortage of American staff. Some attempt is being made to check corruption, several notorious officers having been removed from their posts, but the disease is now so firmly established that military courts cannot be induced to convict even in flagrant cases. 46. Some handicaps from which the army was suffering have been removed by the arrival from America of 100,000 pairs of boots and 200 lorries. It is under stood that a further 400 lorries are also available from consignments intended for Russia, which the Russians are unwilling to accept. These, if properly used, should greatly improve the mobility of the army, but the need for lighter vehicles^ preferably armoured, for the patrolling of roads still remains. It is not known whether the remainder of the equipment demanded from America by General Ridley can be supplied or not. (b) Gendarmerie. 47. No progress whatever has been made with the reform of the gendarmerie, in spite of the fact that in this force there is much less active opposition to the American advisers. The latter have so far limited themselves to paper schemes and have done little to remedy the obvious elementary defects of the force. Colonel Schwarzkopf, the senior American adviser, is now' in America endeavour ing to secure the shipment of the equipment he has demanded. / Persian A ir Force. 48. Brigadier-General Prince Mohammed Hussein Firuz has been appointed to command the Persian Air Force. He is a cavalry man with no air experience, but he has taken up his duties with considerable vigour and is not only anxious to receive advice but willing to act on it. Under his direction the process of reorganisation is being accelerated, though much remains at the paper stage. The strength in officers and men appears to have been reduced by about one-third, largely by transfer to other branches of the army. It had been hoped to retain Colonel Mohanna in command of the technical branches of the air force, but he felt unable to accept the terms of reference proposed and is at present unemployed. 49. The twelve pilots selected for training in the United Kingdom on the terms of His Majesty’s Government’s later offer to provide their instruction free have left Tehran for Egypt en route to England. 50. The willingness of His Majesty’s Government to provide Oxford air craft in place of Hurricanes in repayment for the Mohawks taken over two years ago has been much appreciated by the Persian authorities and has whetted their appetite for more such equipment. They hope that the change of type will entitle them to more than ten Oxfords and profess themselves anxious to purchase more again, especially for early delivery. Rural Improvements. 51. Dr. H. D. Allen, an American who has been touring the countryside for the purpose of advising the Persian Government on rural education, has com pleted his investigations. He informs me that, before the task of improving health, education, agriculture and social conditions in the villages can be begun, three things are necessary : ( 1 ) the authorities in Tehran must be made “ country- minded ” : at present they know nothing about village life and they care as little; ( 2 ) more water must be provided for irrigation : one of the obstacles is that the officials do not wish for cheap schemes which are easy to carry out, but for large pretentious projects which will give a richer yield in bribes; (3) the feudal system, which at present prevents the peasant from enjoying the fruits of any improve ments that he may effect, must be broken. Press. 52. In its preoccupation with internal affairs the press was inclined to over look the fact that Persia was at war and there was little evidence of any desire to t 4 t11 increase the country’s contribution to the common effort. Attention was concen trated rather on past services and the hope of rewards to come. A watchful eye was kept on the Moscow Conference and some anxiety was expressed lest internal disputes might prejudice the country’s claim for consideration. 53. Innumerable articles were written exhorting the people of Persia to vote r for honest and worthy candidates for the next Majlis, which, it was generally •^sumed, would be called on to deal with questions arising out of the Peace Con- xorence. I he present Deputies were accused of all manner of intrigues to secure ( their re-election, and the Government was frequently blamed for unlawful inter ference in the voting. On the whole, however, M. Soheily received more support and less abuse than he had done during previous months. 54. Sayyed Zia received a favourable welcome, but it was not long before the Tudeh party papers started to attack him and accuse him of being a reactionary. The popular belief that the British were responsible for his return was reflected in some mischievous articles which appeared in Azad (subsequently suppressed) suggesting that he had been brought here to counter Russian influence and the spread of progressive ideas. 55. Dr. Millspaugh was subjected to some irresponsible criticism, but his threatened resignation did much to subdue his critics and the eventual passing of the Income-Tax Bill was welcomed by the majority of the papers. Some of them, however, complained that it had been so whittled away in the process that it had lost most of its value. 56. The food situation and the high cost of living were constant subjects f of discussion and the Government was repeatedly attacked for its inability to handle these problems. The slight drop in wholesale prices during recent weeks caused the press to look more optimistically upon the prospects for the coming t winter. British Council. 57. 1 he winter teaching session of the Anglo-Persian Institute in Tehran opened on the 9th October, the number of club members and of students attending classes totalling over 1 , 200 . British Council staff also gave English lessons in the Teachers College at the Tehran University, in the Alborz College at Tehran (run by the Ministry of Education), and in the 1 echnical Colleges at Tehran and Isfahan (run by the Ministry of Industry and Mines). An Anglo-Iranian Dramatic l^ociety has been inaugurated in Tehran and three one-act plays will be produced in December. A very successful photographic exhibition portraying 1 he Beauty of Britain was opened on the 15th November for a week. Weeklv lectures included two at the University, one on “Samuel Johnson’’ by His Majesty s Minister, and one on My Expeditions to the Karakoram,” by Dr. Visser, Netherlands Minister in Angora; weekly gramophone concerts have been continued, varied by a recital by a living artist. Weeklv film shows have also been continued, in spite of the shortage of suitable films and equipment. The opening of a book-shop is under consideration and publication has begun of a children s magazine in Persian, which is in wide demand; a woman’s magazine and a cultural monthly journal are in preparation. 58. An Anglo-Persian Institute is being organised in Isfahan and English classes have been started there. 59. The Russians have paid the British Council in Persia the compliment of the sincerest form of flattery by proposing to organise a Russian Institute in Tehran on similar lines to the British Institute. 60. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Minister of State Resident in the Huddle East, to His AIa]esty s Ambassador at Mhscow, to the Secretarv to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department and to all consular officers in Persia.

THE period since my despatch No. 271 of the 29th June last has culminated ’'g &gt; e CA «j&amp;w * ill the'Imperial firnraii of the 9th September declaring war on Germany. Early . . in July the Persian Government formally notified me and my Soviet and &lt;■ y American colleagues of their desire to adhere to the declaration of the United Nations and asked to be informed what additional obligations Persia would / httcft**** yn sfc s? thereby incur, and what advantages she would secure. An agreed reply by all //.fjT. - three Governments was in due course returned and the declaration of war followed^ jLt immediately. Apart from the fact that Germany’s principal European ally had collapsed on the previous day, it came at an opportune moment, when the Alee ^^ ,, /%+/ / “ round-up ” of German agents in Persia, to which I shall allude later in this j . U ‘ despatch, provided the Persian Government with a ready-made justification for their action. The declaration of war has been very well received by the Majlis and by the press. 2. To the general surprise, perhaps to his own. M. Soheily remains the head of the Government. No one has much confidence in him, and he has main tained his position more by astute manoeuvring and taking advantage of the preoccupation of the Deputies about their chances of re-election than by any remarkable display of statecraft or good government. The Shah, though evidently anxious to change Soheily for either Mansur, Saed or Ala—or perhaps Hajhir—is sensitive about a series of determined attacks on him which have been appearing in the press, and has been frightened into signing, with great reluctance, a document establishing the responsibility of the Minister of War and placing the General Staff under that Minister instead of in an independent position answerable only to the Shah. Soheily can also claim credit for passing the law establishing the powers of the American Director-General of Police, Mr. Timmerman. The vacant post of Minister of Justice has been filled by the- elderly Sadr, a stiff and reactionary ex-mulla. Dr. Siyasi, an enlightened Minister of Education, resigned at the end of August, but the Ministry of the Interior has recently been strengthened by the appointment of Tadayyun. in succession to Hussein Samli, who fortunately only served a few weeks, having been appointed on the 10th July. 3. The elections are supposed to have begun, the usual firman having been issued on the proper date, the 24th August. Up to the present only one election result, that of Kurdan and Shahriyar, has been announced. Most of the other constituencies seem to be inactive and it is doubtful whether many other elections will be concluded before the end of the month of Ramazan (end of September); in fact, a movement for postponing the elections altogether appears to be gaining strength. The usual accusations of intervention by the Russians in their zone are frequently heard, though concrete evidence is very scanty and the Soviet authorities disclaim any interest in the Tudeh party. In our own area, consuls have been encouraged to make recommendations concerning the most satisfactory local candidate, and the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior have both consulted this legation about our views on various candidates. It seems, at any rate, clear that the Government is unhappy about the prospects of riots and disorder during electoral contests. The Tehran elections are hanging fire owing to a dispute oetween the electoral college and the Government concerning the advisability of abolishing the present military governorship of Tehran. 4. Haji Agha Hussein Qummi (see paragraph 12 of my despatch under reference) returned to Tehran from Meshed in August and awaited a reply from the Government to his proposals for the re-establishment of religion in this country; his principal demands are freedom for women to wear the veil, prohibition of mixed education for young persons, the restoration of the waqf funds to their original administrators, and political pressure on Ibn Sand with a view to securing his consent to the repair of certain tombs in Medina. The2 Government gave an example oi their usual weakness by replying to Qummi in a Cabinet decree in which they stated that in the matter of the veil there would be no molestation and that mixed schools for boys and girls would be abolished, and gave him some satisfaction on the other points also. . '/a ! . x 5. Public security in the capital and in some of the provinces is ^deteriorating; hooliganism and stabbing are prominent, and though one criminal has actually been executed in Tehran, robbery and crimes of violence seem likely- to go on increasing as long as rising prices increase the misery of the poor. Tribal Situation — South-West Persia. 6 . In my despatch under reference I suggested that if the Persian Govern ment did not mishandle the advantageous situation that had resulted from the dispersal of Nasir Qashgai’s forces and the occupation by Government troops of Firuzabad and Farashband there was an opportunity of making a settlement with the Qashgai tribes that might lead to a temporary peace. The Persian Government, however, failed entirely to make use of the political factors in their favour; the Persian forces failed to press their military advantage; new intrigues were set on foot, encouraged, no doubt, by German agents; and the Boir Ahmadi tribes, under the absconding chief, Abdullah Zarghampur, were persuaded to lend support to the Qashgai. 7. On the 3rd July the tribes, assisted, it is commonly believed, by treachery among the troops, scored a signal success against a Persian garrison at Semirum, a village on the northern limit of the Qashgai summer quarters. The whole force of some 900 men, after a poor show of resistance, was captured by the tribes with all its arms. 8 . This disaster entirely altered the situation. The tribes were greatly encouraged. The Persian forces, correspondingly depressed, became obviously incapable of restoring the situation by their own efforts. Fortunately, it had already been decided that Bushire should be closed as an entry port for supplies to Russia and there were only some 550 trucks there to be moved up the Shiraz- Isfahan road. These were escorted by troops of Persia and Iraq force and were cleared without incident. But there was still ample cause for anxiety. The Boir Ahmadi, whose territory touches the southern oilfields, were now in open rebellion; some sections of the Bakhtiari, under Abdul Qasim, were known to be harbouring German agents and to be in close contact with the Boir Ahmadi and Qashgai leaders; the tribes, suffering under real and imagined grievances of the last twenty years, were in a mood that predisposed them to listen to incite ment against the Central Government and the British authorities who supported it. It was presumably the desire of German agents to create the maximum amount of disorder in the hope of creating opportunities for sabotage, embroiling British troops with the tribes and dislocating to the maximum extent the country’s economy and administration. 9. Frightened by the possibilities and by their own weakness the Shah and the Government proposed to send Qavam ul Mulk to Fars as governor- general with extensive powers, hoping that by his influence he would be able to rally against Nasir Qashgai the Khassah tribes, who formerly owed allegiance to his family, and even some of the Qashgai tribes. I cordially supported this proposal, but the Government, in truly Persian fashion, having decided that their salvation lay in the Qavam, then made every difficulty about the grant to him of the reasonable conditions he demanded and made no attempt to check the power ful intrigues against his appointment that were at once instigated by Nasir’s friends and other enemies of the Allies. 10 . It was not until the 10 th August that Qavam ul Mulk left for Shiraz. Meanwhile, Nasir and his brother, Khasrow, had already notified the Governor of Bakhtiari, a fellow-tribesman, of their desire to open negotiations with the Persian authorities. This was undoubtedly in part due to the appointment of Qavam, but to a greater extent to the fall of Mussolini and the Russian victories, I news of which had by this time filtered through to the tribes. A meeting was arranged between Nasir, Khosrow, the Governor of Bakhtiari and the newly appointed general officer commanding of the Persian forces of the south, at which Colonel Robert, a British liaison officer, who has established some personal prestige with the Qashgai leaders, was present. The outcome of this meeting was that Khosrow agreed to come to Tehran to express repentance for past mis deeds, and to ask for certain terms for himself and his brother. They amounted to this: Khrosrow should be made governor of the Qashgai; he undertook to return all arms captured from Persian troops and to restrain the tribes from robbing; Nasir should be allowed to be elected a Deputy for Firuzabad, and whenprotected by that immunity he would leave Qashgai territory; the Government should immediately return to Nasir those of his lands now held by the Govern ment. 11. Although the acceptance of these terms is almost a surrender by the Government to the Qashgai and in all probability merely postpones a trial of strength, I did not feel justified in advising them to reject them, realising that they must play for time. I informed the Prime Minister that it was for his /-^Government to decide the terms of settlement that should be made with the tribes, but that I should not be satisfied unless they included an undertaking that the Qashgai would hand over any Germans in their territory and would allow British officials free movement among the tribes. Krosrow signed an undertaking to this effect before leaving Tehran. I also impressed on the Prime Minister that the retention of Qavam ul Mulk as governor-general in Ears was essential if I was to be sure that British interests were not being neglected. I informed him that our confidence in the Qavam had been strengthened by the discovery in a diary found on a captured German agent, that the Qavam s appointment to Shiraz was regarded by the Germans with great alarm. 12. In spite of the conciliatory replies given by the Government to Khosrow and their perhaps too evident desire to settle the trouble in Pars by peaceful means, Nasir continues to profess dissatisfaction with the assurances given, and he has refused friendly invitations from the governor-general and the Persian general officer commanding in Ears, supported by the advice of His Majesty’s Consul, to visit Shiraz for further discussion. He is now using the pretext that it is his distrust of Qavam ul Mulk that is hindering a settlement. There can, however, now be little doubt that Nasir has only been playing for time and that nothing but force or the threat of force will induce him to abandon his pretensions to be the power in Ears. It is reliably reported that he is harbouring the absconding Deputy, Nowbakht, and his son, whose arrest had been demanded by the Allies, and that, in spite of Khosrow’s written undertaking, there are still Germans in Qashgai territory. There is, however, reason to hope that the influence for evil of Germans with the tribes has weakened. Abul Qasim, the rebel Bakhtiari leader, has already surrendered against a pardon and is now in Tehran; there are dissensions among the Boir Ahmadi chiefs, all of whom are, in various ways, making approaches to the Government, though possibly with no more sincere intention than that of gaining time, and, for the time being, the Qashgai have ceased their brigandage. But the elements of disorder are still present, German agents have still the opportunity to incite attacks against our interests, and the foundations of a lasting peace will not be laid until the Persian Government and its forces are strong enough to dictate to the tribes. The Minister for War is now visiting Ears to study the situation on - the spot. ^ Tribal Situation — Kurdistan. 13. In Northern Kurdistan, although tribal territory is still almost entirely free from Persian control, the fear of Russian action has confined Kurdish lawlessness within reasonable limits. There has been some raiding across the Turkish border, and the Turkish sheep brought back are reported to have found ready purchasers among the Soviet troops. In Southern Kurdistan, where we are more closely interested, the uneasy peace that has prevailed for some time seemed likely to be disturbed by the escape from Iraqi surveillance and the return to Persia of that troublesome chief, Mahmud Dizli. He endeavoured to rally certain Kurdish chiefs to his support, wrote threatening letters to the commander of the local Persian troops demanding the withdrawal of his forces even further from tribal territory, and then ventured to attack these troops. He was repulsed with some loss, and as, at approximately the same time, a minor operation drove another troublesome chief, Suleiman Rukhzadeh Jaf, back to Iraq, the tribal bellicosity fizzled out. Attempts have been made by German agents to get into contact with some of the Southern Kurdish tribes to prepare them for the arrival of parachutists and to induce them to prepare landing grounds, but reliable information is not available as to the extent to which the tribes have been responsive. Security. 14. In view of the serious deterioration in the general political situation, which was being exploited by enemy agents, and the dropping of German parachutists in various parts of Persia, and of the possible breakdown of Govern- \ment. I recommended, amongst other things, that full use should be made of any4 information connected with the Axis plot of last year, and that the arrest of certain dangerous Persians if necessary by ourselves in view of the utter corruption and inefficiency of the Persian police—would have a salutary effect. ulfy leahsed that such arrests might annoy the American Government, but, on the othei hand, 1 considered our case had become immeasurably stronger in that we weie now responsible lor the security of American troops transporting supplies to Kussia. Further, as far as the Soviet Government were concerned such action was in their real interests and was intended to ensure the safe arrival^ of aid to Russia without interruption. I had in the meantime discussed the matter with my Soviet colleague and pressed for close co-operation. He replied that he had already asked his Government for authority to request the Persian (government to arrest certain Persian suspects. 15. I was in due course authorised by you to make use of our knowledge of the plot at my discretion, but you were doubtful of the advisability of our arresting the Persian suspects ourselves. At the same time you explained the whole position to the American and Soviet Governments, and invited the latter to send instructions to their representative in Tehran to discuss with me the question of the arrest by the Persian Government of certain dangerous Persians with a view to reaching agreement on a common line of action. It was felt that such joint action would be far more effective. As it was evident that direct American participation was hardy to be expected, the most that could be hoped for from the American Government was general friendly support. 16. 1 he authority given to me to make use of information about the plot arrived at a most opportune moment, as the Deputy, Naubakht, had just tabled an interpellation of the Government, and of the Minister for War in particular attacking the Government and the Allies. I accordingly furnished the Prime Minister and the Minister for War with suitable evidence regarding Naubakht’s pro-Ax is and other treasonable activities, both in connexion with the plot and since that date, so as to enable them to produce a crushing reply. In order to test the sincerity of the Prime Minister’s recent offer to me to arrest anybody against whom I might be able to produce proper evidence, I at the same time in a letter of the 5th August requested him to withdraw Naubakht’s parliamentary immunity to enable him to be arrested and sent to Sultanabad for detention and interrogation in accordance with the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1942. After the usual delays the interpellation was finally fixed for the 24th August, but Naubakht, undoubtedly scenting danger and realising how weak his hand had become, particularly in view of the arrest of certain Germans in Tehran, failed to put in an appearance. The Government did not feel themselves strong enough to ask the Majlis to remove his immunity, and it is now reported that he and his son have fled to the Shiraz district. 17. It soon became clear that, if the Axis-controlled organisations were tq be really effectively dislocated, a much larger number of arrests than orio-inally foreseen would have to be effected. Accordingly, a list of about 140 suspects, including seventy Persian railway employees known to be implicated in railway sabotage organisations, was prepared and communicated by me to my Soviet and American colleagues. Amongst those whose names figured in the list were such persons as ^ Kashani, Kupal, Pourzand, Naubakht, &amp;c. General Connollv. American General Officer Commanding, whom I also consulted regarding tiU suspect railway employees, promised full collaboration. The attitude of mv American colleague was more satisfactory than last year, and I hoped to be able to rely on his acquiescence in the arrests. At the time my Soviet colleague had not received final instructions, and it was not until the 29th August that I handed to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the full Anglo-Soviet list of 162 suspects with a request that they should be arrested and sent to Sultanabad for detention and interrogation. It was made clear to the Prime Minister that written evidence in all cases would be forthcoming as soon as the majority of the suspects were safely under lock and key at Sultanabad. My Soviet colleague spoke in the same sense immediately afterwards. We both assured the I l ime Mumstei that we would continue to give him our support if he agreed to our request. The Prime Minister then promised to give orders for the arrests to begin at dawn on the 30th August. So far the arrests have been effected smoothly and efficiently by the Persian authorities, and it is most gratifying that the demands of the Allies have been executed with such little disturbance to the normal life of the country. In particular, the co-operation of the American military on the railway was extremely helpful. Up to the present about 110 suspects have been arrested. So far it has been unnecessary for me except in the case of the railway employees, to avail myself of the discretiongiven to me in your telegram No. . 755, namely, to effect arrests ourselves. On the 2 nd September the Persian Government, in agreement with my Soviet colleague and myself, issued a communique justifying their attitude in regard to the arrests. • Finance. 18. 1 here has been little or no change in the financial situation, which continues to be critical. Prices continue to rise, and the condition of the poorer classes and lower-paid Government officials is serious. In spite of pruning of all estimates by Ur. Millspaugh, Government expenditure continues to rise and there is a constant excess of expenditure over revenue. Attempts to raise additional revenue by income tax or other means continue to be stultified by obstruction by the Majlis o 1 ’other interested parties. Sales of gold and silver, both for British and ior Persian account, have been carried out. but not on a sufficient scale to check the rise m commodity prices. Faced with a large deficit on the budget for C ^ii - elll £* ■ vear ’ ■^ r ' Millspaugh advised the Persian Government to approach the Allies for a loan, and also to request the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company for an advance against this year’s royalties. 19 - Income Tax Bill prepared by Dr. Millspaugh was submitted to the Majlis on the 28th May. It provides for a sharp increase in contributions in the hig.iei income levels, with the avowed object of recouping from merchants contractors and landowners some of the extravagant profits made by them during the past year. It has been bitterly obstructed in the Majlis, where the parties affected are most strongly entrenched, and its passage in something like its original form, or its rejection, may well mark the ultimate success or failure of the Millspaugh Mission. 20 . The budget, which was submitted to the Majlis on the 29th July, estimated revenue at 1.890,795,096 rials and expenditure at 3,297.718,537. To the estimated deficit of some 1,406 million rials Dr. Millspaugh expects that it will be necessary to add a further 500 million rials to provide some compensation to Government officials for the steep increase in the cost of living. As it will in any case take some considerable time for the income tax law (if and when passed) and other proposed measures to raise additional revenue in Persia, Dr. Millspaugh has advised the Government to request the American and/or British Govern ments for a loan sufficient to cover the total deficit of 1.900 million rials. A fuithei ievolving sum of oOO million rials is needed to finance gram collection, and Dr. Millspaugh has recommended that if possible this sum' should also be borrowed from the Allied Governments. In addition to this, the Persian Govern ment have been obliged to approach the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company for advances on the oil royalties payable in 1943-44. The latter approach was successful; the former is still under consideration by the Governments concerned. Meanwhile Dr. Millspaugh is hopefully looking round for financial windfalls. Having asked His Majesty s Legation to try to obtain advances on account of freights due by the Allies to the Persian State Railways, he found himself presented 0 with a bill tor over 200 million rials due to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation* tt V r^ lspaU - gh then su g.g este( ? that he . be given a respite by setting off the U.K.C.C. claim against his claim for railway advances. 21 . In pursuit of price stabilisation Dr. Millspaugh continued to issue regulations under the authority of the special powers conferred on him by the Majlis. The I rice Stabilisation Section has been given extensive powers in respect of foreign trade, rent control, control of motor vehicles and tyres, control of transportation and sale of cereals, &amp;c. A Government Pharmaceutical Institute has been established. Dr. Millspaugh recognises that such measures cannot alone stabilise prices, and that they must be 'supplemented by internal borrowing and emergency taxation. A project for issuing Treasury bonds is before the Majlis. In his latest monthly report he expresses optimism regarding the prospects of control of speculation and inflation, but the results of°all his labours are as yet hard to find and very few share his optimism. 22 . The cost of living index has moved from 910 in June 1943 to 917 in August 1943. The quantity of notes in circulation has increased from 4,058 millions in June to 4,307 millions in August 1943. The presence of Allied troops makes further expansion inevitable, but every effort is being made to keep the expenditure by British forces as low as possible. The acute shortage of currency notes which was experienced a few months ago has been eased bv fairlv considerable arrivals from the United Kingdom, and more are en route. 23. With the double object of obtaining rials for His Majesty’s forces and ot ieducing commodity prices, sales of gold coins for British account were begun [46-15] B 3 '6 ■w-ir ■ — at the end of J une; sales of gold bars and of silver were undertaken at the same time by the Persian Government, and close co-operation was established. Owing to various causes, one of which was an inadequate supply of coins, it has not yet been possible to carry out the scheme on the scale originally intended, and the effect on commodity prices has not been noticeable. About £500,000 worth of Persian currency has, however, been obtained in advantageous conditions for His Majesty's forces. The offer of gold has also increased confidence in Persian currency, and has probably led to some reduction in issues of fresh currency. The price of sovereigns has fallen during the period of sales from 700 rials' on the 12 th July to 580 rials at the end of August. One hundred thousand Pahlavis (equivalent to gold sovereigns) are being coined for British account, and, provided the rather fickle market remains good at the reduced price, sales may be expected to increase. 24. By the Currency Law of the 19th November, 1942, the metallic reserves of the National Bank of Persia were revalued on the basis of 35 dollars per fine ounce of gold and 23^. per ounce of silver, thus creating a substantial profit in rials which has been carried to a special reserve. All new issues of currency after the promulgation of the law must be backed as to 60 per cent, gold for sterling or dollars convertible into gold and 40 per cent, sterling or dollars guaranteed against depreciation in terms of gold. By a decree of the Council of Ministers, No. 5922 of the 31st May 1943, the note-issue functions of the National Bank are separated from its banking functions and the bank is divided into an issue department and a banking department. After the separation the commercial or banking section now has its capital fully paid up and its reserves appreciably strengthened. Civil Supplies. 25. Since 1941 imports of civil goods into Persia have been drastically curtailed owing to the need to economise shipping. Persia tightened her belt with a fairly good grace and even endured a reduction of imports which w T as perhaps more drastic than that applied to other Middle Eastern countries. Ordinary import and export trade virtually ceased, and it may be that the coup de grace has been given by Dr. Millspaugh’s recent regulations declaring many articles to be Government monopolies and restricting merchants’ profits on imports to 5 per cent. There is no question, however, but that these measures were necessary. 1 26. None the less, if there is now a prospect of more shipping and more goods for the Middle East. Persia should be among the first to benefit. Increased supplies of some essential civil goods are already believed to be in sight; more tea has been offered from India, and the United States may be able to supply cotton piece-goods and yarns. The organisation of road and rail transport is improving, and this should be less of an obstacle to importation and distribution. After her declaration of war against Germany, Persia will probably look to the Allies for a more generous policy in this respect. 27. Persian industry is still in difficulties; transport is easier owing to the allocation of some lend-lease trucks to factories and mines, but there is much discontent among employees because of low salaries. This directly affects supplies of civil goods, and the Anglo-American supply committees are consequently giving all the help they can towards the maintenance of these industries. T ran sport. 28. Road .—The Road Transport Department has been reorganised. An American, Mr., Vivian, has replaced Mr. Birkle as director, and the staff has been strengthened by the addition of several Anglo-Saxon assistants. The Millspaugh Mission is showing keen interest in the welfare of the department and is co-operating with the Road Transport Board in improving the control and organisation of road transport. The department now has nearly 1,000 lend-lease vehicles and (theoretically) about the same number of contracted vehicles. The control of the latter is nebulous but will become better as organisation improves. Lend-lease vehicles are being steadily distributed for the transport of cereals; and coal and charcoal are being moved more or less according to plan. Unsuitable tyres and the lack of spare parts and maintenance facilities handicap the efficiency of the department’s fleet. The control of road transport in the provinces has left much to be desired but should improve when the department has more staff. 29. Rail .—The allocation for civil supplies, excluding oil, amounts to 8,000 tons a month. The allocation for oil for civil requirements is 678 tons a day. Oil stocks in Tehran are now substantial, with the exception of petrol,which became reduced owing to the concentration on supplies to Kussia. This position is now being corrected. A British Movements Officer was sent to Ahwaz to supervise civil loadings and an immediate improvement resulted. It is now proposed to set up a Civil Movements Control organisation under the direct supervision of the Millspaugh Mission. Food Situation. 30. There have been several fundamental changes in the organisation oi the Ministry of Supply since my last despatch was written. It has, in fact, ceased to exist as a Ministry, since in August it was divided into two sections—the Cereals and Bread Section under Mr. Sheridan, to deal with grain collection and the feeding of towms, and the Price Stabilisation Section under Mr. Robinson of the American Financial Mission, to deal with the stabilisation of prices and the distribution of Government monopoly goods such as tea, sugar and piece-goods. Dr. Millspaugh has personally assumed responsibility for grain collection in addition to his duties as Adviser-General of the Finances. Meanwhile Mr. Sheridan’s contract expires in September and at his request is not being renewed. He took the few weeks’ leave due to him and left Persia on the 28th August, 1943. Mr. Crawford, an American member of the Middle East Supply Centre, has succeeded him temporarily, pending the arrival from the United States of a permanent incumbent, engaged by Dr. Millspaugh, who is expected to reach Tehran during the first half of September. 31. The Persian Government propose to employ three main methods for collecting the grain they need—undertakings by landlords to sell an assessed proportion of their crop to Government at the Government-controlled price, forward contracts with reliable contractors, and purchase from the peasant of his surplus in return for 90 per cent, of the Government price in cash and 10 per cent, in sugar or tea. I his last method, known locally as the barter system, is being held in abeyance in most areas, until a considerable proportion of landlords’ undertakings have been completed, for fear that landlords should be tempted to withhold their grain in the hope of disposing of it through their peasants and so obtain large quantities of sugar or tea for sale on the black market. In Khuzistan, however, where, contrary to all expectations, undertakings for 14.000 tons have been obtained and delivery of over 10,000 tons already secured, the barter system has just been introduced with a view to buying up a proportion of the peasants' surplus. If all goes well, the estimated total by both methods is between 15,000 and 20,000 tons, or aproximately sufficient for the needs of the towns of Khuzistan till next harvest. Last year’s collections amounted to about 400 tons only; as a result the local market in wheat had to be freed, and this was followed by an immediate rise in the price of bread to 10 rials or 12 rials per kilo. Government-controlled bread of good quality at 4 rials per kilo, has after one set-back, which took the form of a riot instigated by interested persons, now T been on sale in Ahwaz for over a month. 32. The target figure for collection throughout the country was given by Mr. Sheridan, perhaps somewhat optimistically, at 300.000 tons. Collections so far have been slow and are reported by the Cereals and Bread Section to be only 37,000 tons to the end of August. The same source puts undertakings secured plus amounts contracted for at just over 171,000 tons, though undertakings are still being obtained in many areas. The unknown factor, which is liable seriously to reduce Mr. Sheridan’s estimate, is the quantity required by the Soviets for their own needs and their attitude towards collection in and export from the Russian zone. I hope that this will become clearer in the course of next week or two. If it does not, I propose to ask my American colleague to join me in a request to the Soviet authorities for a definition of their attitude, since a failure to supply Persia with a considerable share of grain from the rich northern provinces this year would almost inevitably result in an appeal from the Persian Government to the British and American Governments for imported grain to feed the country. The position at the moment is complicated by the fact that the Persian Government has still some 7,000 tons of grain to deliver on contracts concluded with the Soviet last year. Meanwhile Dr. Millspaugh has quite cleverly manoeuvred the Soviet authorities into a more awkward position than they were in last year with respect to grain collection for their own use or for export. Dr. Millspaugh, having inserted a clause in one of his regulations to the effect that all foreign authorities desiring to buy grain were required to obtain his permission, made a statement to the press in which he said that he was satisfied from his own investigations that neither the British nor the American forces were buying grain in Persia for their own consumption or export. The Sovietauthorities, owing to the war situation, had need of grain but must first ensure that Persian requirements were satisfied before exporting grain. In any event, he would publish any applications from foreign authorities to purchase cereals in this country. It is not likely that this will deter the Soviet authorities from seeking to obtain a considerable quantity of grain, but it should at least serve to clear us to some extent of the unfounded charge of buying grain to the detriment of the country’s food supply, and at the same time to bring the Soviet authorities into the open in this matter. As you are aware, the Soviet authorities exported large quantities of grain last year unknown to the public, and simul taneously secured undeserved kudos by exporting to Persia 25.000 tons of wheat, the delivery of which has just been completed. 33. On the legislative side, Dr. Millspaugh has recently published three regulations, Nos. 14, 15 and 16, which, in brief, are designed to create a Govern ment monopoly in cereals to enable the price of rice to be fixed by Government at a later date, to make the black market in cereals illegal, to prohibit the movement of grain into towns except on Government account, and to enable such members of the public as wish to bake their own bread to buy flour from Government stocks against surrender of bread coupons. Apart from the allocation of too large a quantity of flour as obtainable against a bread coupon, through ignorance of the fact.that 1 pound of flour produces 1-4 pounds of bread, these regulations on the whole are salutary. Unfortunately, however, in this country there is an almost unbridgeable gulf between the promulgation of a law and its enforcement. 34. Towards the end of August it became evident that unless energetic measures were taken Tehran would already be faced with the danger of a bread shortage at the beginning of October. Dr. Millspaugh’s attention was invited by His Majesty’s Legation to the fact that present stocks in the silo would be exhausted on the 18th September, and that the remaining quantities from Russia, even if delivered promptly, would last only a further ten days. From about the 1st October, therefore, the city would have to depend on local collections of grain which up to that date amounted to only 300 tons in all. Dr. Millspaugh, who fully shared our apprehensions, caused energetic steps to be taken to expedite collections and transport to the silo, with the result that the daily deliveries rose first to 50 tons, then to over 100 tons, and on the 6 th September over 300 tons were delivered in one day. If this is maintained or increased the silo stock—since consumption is in the neighbourhood of 250 tons a day—will slowly begin to rise from the comparatively low level of 4,000 tons of wheat to which it had fallen. At the same time Mr. Crawford proposes gradually to reintroduce a percentage of adulterant into the bread and thus utilise the imported barley and millet already in stock and barley which is now coming in from the current harvest. The Cereals and Bread Section state that landlords’ undertakings obtained in the Tehran area amount to 20.000 tons. If most of these are fulfilled without undue difficulty or delay, a breathing space of two or three months should be gained in which arrangements for the collection and transport to Tehran from surplus areas can be made. There are, however, apart from the reluctance of growers to part with their grain, two main difficulties in the way of collections throughout the country—shortage of funds and the misuse of transport by drivers and local officials. The first has been accentuated by the bifurcation of the Ministry of Supply into a Cereals and Bread Section and a Price Stabilisation Section. The revolving fund of 5 million rials estimated by Mr. Sheridan to be sufficient to buy the grain needed by the Government, was fixed partly on the assumption that incomings from the sale of tea, sugar and piece-goods would be available, but these will not now automatically accrue to the Cereals and Bread Section. Mr. Crawford is putting to Dr. Millspaugh the case for a further allocation of funds to his section. Meanwhile Dr. Millspaugh has some difficulty in finding even a few million rials at a time for grain purchase which the Cereals and Bread Section distribute piece-meal among areas where the clamour for funds is loudest. 35. To reduce the misuse of transport and to expedite collections generally, arrangements are being made for Major McDowell, Transport Officer, Middle East Supply Centre, and Lieutenant-Colonel Ataullah, I.M.S., whose services have been loaned to the Cereals and Bread Section of the Persian Government, to visit the more important grain-producing areas, if possible by aeroplane. 36. Before he went into hospital with a severe cold a few days ago, Dr. Millspaugh proposed to hold a conference of his senior officials, at which also His Majesty’s Legation and Middle East Supply Centre were to be represented, in order to iiiscuss finance, transport and other matters connected with this year’s food supply for Persia. I trust the conference will he held as soon as9 Dr. Millspaugh leaves hospital, and I will see that he is informed of the proposals for dealing with recalcitrant landlords contained in the correspondence resting with your telegram No. 736 of the 7th August, and his views obtained. 37. It is universally agreed that the yield throughout the country this year has been good, but owing to reduced sowings in many areas as compared with those of a few years ago, the harvest should not, I consider, be rated better than high ^average. Even so, provided proper measures were taken, there should be plenty _&gt;f grain to seed the towns till next harvest, to leave sufficient for the needs of the villages, including ample seed, and to constitute a substantial reserve with which to start next year. The doubtful factor is, of course, the ability of the Persian Government to collect grain from unwilling landlords and to control speculation. In promoting this object our consular officers and consular liaison officers have been of inestimable value, as Mr. Sheridan himself testified on several occasions before he left. They have witnessed sowings, assessed crops, obtained undertakings, arranged forward contracts, brought abuses and corruption to notice and generally done all in their power to ensure the success of this year’s operations. A rmed Forces. 38. There is nothing to record as regards land forces. The air force is suffering from an acute shortage of aircraft and the almost complete lack of any means of keeping serviceable the aircraft it has, since the British forces have dispossessed it of its best airfields and almost the whole of its hangars and repair shops. It is doubtful if it now has as many as twenty first-line aircraft fit for operational use. 39. A policy has therefore been adopted of drastically reducing its establish ment. This has coincided with the appointment of the energetic and unpopular Colonel Mohanna as Chief of the Air Force. 40. His Majesty’s Government’s offer to train twelve Persian officers in- England involves, in its revised form, a financial burden too heavy for the Persian Government to bear. This will be a cause of very great disappointment, particularly to the officers concerned, and it is hoped that some alternative offer may be found possible. 41. The Minister for War has requested that in place of the ten Hurricanes offered by His Majesty’s Government in replacement for aircraft taken over nearly two years ago, a corresponding number of other aircraft may be made available of a type which would more nearly meet the requirements of the Persian Air Force, and which it might be able to maintain in a serviceable condition. This shows a welcome preference for the practical over the showy, and if general purposes aircraft can in fact be provided the efficiency and morale of the Persian Air Force should greatly benefit. 42. It is satisfactory that, in spite of the discouragement which the Persian Air Force has received ever since the occupation of the country by the Allies, no air force officer was among those whose arrest was recently made for participa tion in pro-German activities. This is in notable contrast to the army as a whole. Press. 43. The steady flow of Allied victories during the last two and a half months has led most of the papers to the assumption that peace is not far off and that Persia should therefore be prepared to defend her rights at the Peace Conference. Many papers have argued that she is suffering as much, if not more than, those countries which were actually at war, and that her reward should be commensurate with her sufferings. A few papers attributed these sufferings to Allied occupation of the country and alleged that food-stuff's were being removed by the Allies, but, on the whole, responsibility for the difficult food situation and the unbearably high cost of living is placed on the Government, which is repeatedly and bitterly attacked for its incompetent handling of these questions. The American advisers, in particular Dr. Millspaugh, have come in for much criticism in this connexion, and there is a tendency to despair of their efforts to remedy the financial and economic situation of the country. A similar note of despondency is frequently struck with regard to the forthcoming elections, the general opinion being that, even if they were allowed to be carried through freely, the new Deputies will prove no better than the members of the present Majlis. 44. Attacks on Reza Shah and those who were described as “ the traitorous agents of the dictatorship ” have been frequent, and the present Shah was more than once warned to behave in accordance with the Constitution. Several papers overstepped the mark in their criticism of royalty and were10 suppressed. Others met a similar fate for too outspoken attacks on the Govern ment. But suppression in most cases was not a serious matter. Either the paper was released after a brief interval or else it reappeared in a slightly disguised form under a different name. A dozen or more of the Leftist papers have banded themselves into what they called a “ Freedom Front.” the declared object of which is to achieve national unity in order to defend democracy and oppose despotism. Violent squabbles arose among the different sections of the press over various domestic issues and most scurrilous articles were written by thi*^ participants. The one question on which there has been complete unanimity of opinion is the Persian declaration of war on Germany. All the papers welcomed this step and considered it to be in the interests of the country. British Council. 45 The Council’s organisation has continued to expand during the period under review. Six more persons have joined the Tehran staff; a summer school was opened in July at Tajrish, outside Tehran; and during the visit to Persia of Professor Ifor Evans, of the Council’s London staff, plans which are expected to mature in October were made for the opening of an Anglo-Persian Institute at Isfahan. Professor Evans was received in audience by the Shah; he made numerous contacts among Persians of all classes and lectured with success under the auspices of the Minister of Education. Lectures, film shows and concerts were given at frequent intervals at the Tehran Institute, whose membership rose to 360 students and 450 non-students, wdiile a further 390 students were taught at Tajrish and in secondary schools. Radio lessons in English are now being organised and plans are being actively pursued for the publication of children’s and women’s journals in Persian in co-operation with the Public Relations Bureau of His Majesty’s Legation. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister of State at Cairo: to Minbranch, Bagdad; to the Government of India; and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Moscow.. I have, &amp;c. R. W.

Tehran, '2§th June, 1943.^- ^ q THE .Soheily Government has managed to survive practically intact sin^T . mv despatch No. 139 of the 6 th April last, although it cannot be said that its’^ ^ career nas revealed any particular merit. Bayat (Seham us Sultan) succeeded 4ru± ft**** / Saleh at the Ministry of Finance, and I tibar took over the Ministry of ( Agriculture. Both of these Ministers were also Deputies, a fact which was &lt;T. used in an interpellation by the Deputy Tabatabai during May to attempt to overthrow the Government. The interpellation also alluded to the Govern ment’s action in handing over certain powers to the Military Governor in con nexion with the suppression of the press, but it failed to find much support ') suppression and was rejected by a large majority. Whether this showed that the Majlis was whole-heartedly behind Soheily is more than doubtful. It more probably showed that the Majlis disapproved of Tabatabai, and that the members were unable to make up their minds who would be a satisfactory successor, if Soheily went. A great deal of dissension has been reported among the various members of the Cabinet, most of whom, including Hikmat, Tadayyun and Marshal Amir Ahmedi, seem to have aspired to the post of Prime Minister themselves. Other candidates for that high office were Ali Mansur, now Governor-General of I^horasan, Majid Ahy, now in Russia as Persian Ambassador, and the absent Soyyid Zia ed Din Tabatabai. Hikmat finally resigned in the middle of June, o 1 ring, he said, to his feeling that the Prime Minister was not giving him proper si pport in his administration of the Ministry of Justice. No Minister of the Interior was appointed and Soheily has remained in charge of that Ministry. '2. Signs of a change in tribal policy were to be seen. On the one hand, Marshal Shahbakhti, as the result of constant pressure from this Legation, was dafinitely ordered to call the bluff of Nasir Qashgai and attack the dissident tribesmen with the forces at his disposal. After a great deal of delay he did so, and on the whole the results seem to be satisfactory, as the Qashgai tribal leaders seem to be breaking away from Nasir and his brother Khosrow, both of whom have fled. I have reported on this more fully in the Section ‘ ‘ Tribal Situation ” in this despatch. There has, of course, been a good deal of criticism of the action of the Persian Government, both from Deputies like Naubakht and from the Turkish Ambassador, who speak of “ fratricidal strife.' It is, there fore, to the Government’s credit that it has so far endeavoured to restore order and governmental authority in large areas of South Persia. On the other hand, tribal leaders have, in two cases, been summoned to the aid of the Government. Ibrahim Qawam (Qawam ul Mulk) has been sent to Ears to help Shahbakhti, though without formal appointment to any post, whilst the wealthiest and perhaps the cleverest of the senior Bakhtiari Khans, Morteza Quli Samsam- Bakhtiari, has been sent to govern Bakhtiari. The latter left for his post on the 21st June and it is hoped that he will be able to reassert authority on behalf of the Government throughout his tribal territory, and in particular fo bring the scatter-brained malcontent, Abul-Qasim, to heel. It must not be imagined, however, that these two appointments mean a return to the old system of tribal rule through semi-autonomous “ Il-Khanis.” 3 . In his three first reports for the Persian months covering the period dealt with in this despatch, the Director-General of Finance (Dr. Millspaugh) has made an assessment of the present economic and financial situation in Persia, and has pointed out that the most urgent tasks before the Government are that they should deal with the inflationary rise in price, and should balance the budget. I have already reported at length on these aspects of the situation, and I propose to do no more in this despatch than indicate in broad general terms the financial and economic background against which the Government carries on the country’s business, and the measures that are in being or in con templation for dealing with the emergency. Su ■ O.o. /?. 'h oa j ir/ ‘ [43—41] C4TT*J-***\ / 'G B i - w 'J /] /i.4. The price increase has continued, although there are now signs that the measures of control that Dr. Millspaugh has forecast have stayed the upward course. Wages are slowly attempting to keep pace, although up to now the Government, on account of its own financial stringency, has been unable to increase the salaries of its employees, who, in Dr. Millspaugh’s own words, are “stealing right and left.” Unfortunately, the stealing is not limited to the sums needed by the employees to keep themselves and their families alive. The^ exchequer is faced with immediate bankruptcy, and it is doubtful if, at the end of the current Persian month, there will be enough cash in the Government coffers to enable the Government to meet its essential obligations. 5. A Price-Fixing Scheme has been inaugurated under the powers con- S rred on Dr. Millspaugh by the Special Powers Law, which Soheily, with rhaps more courage than was expected, pushed through the Majlis against powerful, if not very vocal, opposition. So far only the beginnings of the scheme are in being, and the measures already taken are in the nature of preparation of the ground. A Price-Stabilisation Section (P.S.S.) has been established under the direct control of an American director-general, responsible to the Director- General of Finance. The authority of the Majlis is being sought for the engage ment of nine additional American assistants for this service. Certain goods (mainly essential commodities) have been declared Government monopolies, and their import and export prohibited except by the P.S.S. or by merchants acting under Government licence, and regulations have been made with the object of bringing under Government control the stocks of these commodities that are already in the country and held up by speculators and hoarders. An attempt has been made to stabilise rents by a Regulation which fixes rents at the figure prevailing in February 1943. 6 . Two other important projects are before the Majlis—a Bill to revise the present inadequate law relating to Income Tax, and a Bill to authorise an issue of Treasury Bonds. They are making a leisurely progress through Parliamentary Commissions, and Dr. Millspaugh has now informed the Prime Minister that both must be passed without further delay. The Income Tax Bill has aroused much criticicm from the vested interests who would be hard hit by it, and the Prime Minister has already bowed before the storm and hinted that there will be “ adjustments ’’ before the measure reaches the Statute book. 7. Other projects have been launched by the Government in an attempt to reduce the amount of currency in circulation, including the sale of Government stocks of silver and diamonds. Not much success has so far attended them. Sales of gold on behalf of His Majesty’s Government began on the 26th June, and some incidental relief to the currency situation may be afforded by this means. 8 . It it now evident that Persia is faced with a deficit of at least 1,500 million rials on the budget for the current financial year. There is no hope that this can be met from internal resources, and Dr. Millspaugh has already recommended to the Government that an application should be made to Britain and the United States for financial help in the form of a loan. 9. The Majlis has been in session throughout the period under review, and, as mentioned above, has passed some legislation. It also passed the first reading of a Bill for the insurance of workmen in the middle of April. The various so-called “parties” still exist, at any rate on paper. The “ Tudeh ” party is still the only one which seems to have achieved a definite policy and to have conducted a definite campaign in the provinces. Talk of certain other com binations of parties is sometimes heard, e.g., the “ Flamrahan ” party of Mustafa Fateh was said to be reaching an understanding not only with the Liberal “ Millat ” group of Muhammad Sadegh Tabatabai, but also with the “ Tudeh,” but it seems that the Tudeh party was not enthusiastic for the proposal. A good deal has been heard of Seyyid Zia ed Din Tabatabai, but more by way of criticism than of support. Majlis Deputies such as Teheranchi and Niqabat are bitterly opposed to the return of the exiled Seyyid. and the Russians and the Shah seem equally critical. Nevertheless, the Seyyid has a certain number of supporters both in and out of the Majlis, and their latest idea is to arrange for the Seyyid to return to Persia in a private capacity in order to be able to show himself and conduct his own campaign in person. 10 . The elections are beginning to loom very large on the political horizon. The Royal Rescript announcing the coming elections for the 14th Majlis was duly promulgated on the 23rd June, and two months after that the elections are due to commence. The Prime Minister has told journalists that the elections will be free, though whether in actual fact such an unprecedented event will3 take place is doubtful, loo many political forces seem to be interesting them- selves in the coming struggle for a free election to be possible. In the first place, the present Deputies themselves are all anxious to retain their lucrative employment. Secondly, the Prime Minister will no doubt have views, and he seems at present to be making various combinations with wealthy Tehranis and others to secure Deputies who will support him. Thirdly, the Minister of the ^Interior, if ever one is appointed, will no doubt endeavour to assert himself, as r he is in charge of the actual election arrangements. The Shah, too, is expected to have something to say, on similar lines, though not so drastically, as his father used to have. The mullas seem to be coming out into the open about the elections, and the Russians, though they say they are neutral and would never dream of supporting the Tudeh party or any other, are popularly supposed to be intending to rig the elections in the northern areas which are in their occupation. This legation is, of course, subjected to constant pressure to do something about the elections in the south in order to counter-balance the efforts of the Russians. Finally, the army and the gendarmerie may have something to do with the conduct of the elections, especially in the provinces. 11 . Mention should also be made of clear signs that both the Shah and the Government are proposing to do something for the religious elements in this I country. The mullas at Qum appear to have extracted some promises from the Shah during his journey to Isfahan. They appear to have asked for greater freedom for preachers, for the election of five prominent mujtahids to the next Majlis (a provision which existed in the original Constitution but was ignored by Reza Shah), and for the presence of a sort of religious adviser at the Court. Certain negotiations with mujtahids of Kerbels and Najaf seem to be in progress, and one of them, Haji Agha Hussein Qummi, made a pilgrimage from NajaT where he had been throughout the last reign, to Meshed. Four of the oldest mujtahids of Tehran are making overtures to this legation and will no doubt endeavour to get back some of the power, not only religious but also political, of which Reza Shah deprived them so thoroughly. The main pretext for this movement for a return to religion seems to be that it is necessary to counteract the godless influence which is threatening the country from the north. It remains to be seen whether the disadvantages of a reactionary return to political jobbery by venal mullahs will not outweigh the advantages of an anti-Bolshevik drive with the slogan “ Back to Islam ! ” 12 . The Shah has continued to take an active interest in all the affairs of his realm, in fact, he is continually criticised for taking too much interest in some of them, especially in the army, which he is determined to regard as his own special preserve. He also continues to spend the large sums of money which his father has accumulated, and though a great deal goes in charity and good works, the fact that no accounts are ever published lends colour to the stories that circulate about His Majesty giving substantial subsidies to newspaper writers and to Deputies in the Majlis. Hussein Ala has continued to perform the functions of an eloquent and punctilious Minister of Court, though he finds it difficult to restmin the bad influences around the Shah, so difficult that it is doubtful whether he ever tries to do so. A Royal visit to Isfahan early in June was a great success and is to be the precursor of other visits to provincial centres. It seems to have been marred only by the failure of the Queen to arouse the enthusiasm of the women of Isfahan; she did talk to a group of Persian ladies, but only for a few minutes, and through an interpreter. The Shah has been trying during the last few days to exercise an influence over foreign politics by means of press interviews. He has sent to the American people a Fourth of July message, which in the stress it lays upon the love of independence which Persia shares with America might be interpreted by the malevolent in an anti-British sense; and in talking to the representatives of the Daily Herald and the Daily Chronicle he made statements which His Majesty’s Legation fortunafely succeeded in inducing him to delete or amend. One of these statements implied that the sterling-rial rate of exchange was unfair to Persia; another that Great Britain had failed to carry out clause 7 (the economic clause) of the Tripartite Treaty; while a third claimed that, next to the four Great Powers, no country had done so much as Persia for the Allied cause. It is significant that the Shah did not consult the Prime Minister about these interviews; he may have spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject—knowing that M. Saed would not be a severe critic. The personal extravagance of the Court is causing friends of the Pahlevi dynasty much anxiety. It will be remembered that of the 700 million rials which the late Shah transferred to his son, the latter “ lent ” 400 to the State. Of the 300 million which he retained, the Shah has given away (43-41] b24 large sums for charitable and public objects; he has spent much in subsidies to newspapers and individuals to secure their support; and Palace expenditure, particularly that of the Royal sisters, must have swallowed up a very large sum. It is an indication that the end of the 300 million is in sight that he recently sounded Dr. Millspaugh as to a refund, out of the 400 million lent to the State, of a sum which he wanted to give for the provision of a water supply for Bushire —an approach which was unsuccessful. If the Shah has to apply to the State for^. a civil list and is asked to produce an account of his expenditure since his accession to the throne, the figures, if ever produced, will afford a sad contrast to the prevailing poverty of the country during that period and will make it difficult for the Shah to persuade the people that he really is, as he claims to be, a reformer and a “ man of the Left.” Food Situation. 13. An improvement in the rate of delivery of imported wheat, barley and millet has made it possible to build up gradually a reserve of grain in the Government silo at Tehran, which by the 19th June amounted to 10,367 tons, or six weeks’ supply. This process had already begun when, in the second week of April, the Soviet Government, without previously consulting His Majesty’s Government or the United States Government, announced their intention of despatching to Tehran, beginning in May, a quantity of 25,000 tons of wheat at the rate of 7,500 tons a month. The promised wheat, according to the Soviet authorities in Tehran, bore no relation to deliveries under the Anglo-American Food Agreement. It was also not to interfere, as the Persian Government soon discovered, with the delivery by the Persian Ministry of Supply to the Russian forces in-Azerbaijan of the full amounts of grain previously agreed upon between the Soviet authorities and the Persian Ministry of Supply, viz., 5,000 tons of wheat, 15,000 tons of barley and 30,000 tons of rice. More curiously still, from our point of view, the Russian promise to the Persian Government was made independently of the fact that 20,000 tons of wheat and flour were then en route to the Persian Gulf on Russian account, including 10,000 tons of leind-leiid wheat. 14. The Russian grain began to arrive in Tehran on the 10 th May, and by the 19th June nearly 8,000 tons had been delivered. Our own deliveries of wheat are likely to be limited in consequence of this new development to the 25,000 tons originally promised to the Persian Government under the Food Agreement, of which some 21,000 tons have already been handed over. If Russian deliveries are maintained it will probably be unnecessary for us to deliver the further 5,000 tons which it was estimated would be necessary to keep the country supplied until the harvest. Arrangements are also being made to stop any further supply of adulterants from Iraq. Tehran is already consuming all-wheat bread. 15. The Persian Government took advantage in May of the improved supply position in Tehran to raise the price of Government bread throughout the country from 2 rials a kilog. to 3 rials a kilog., in order to avoid the loss hitherto incurred on subsidised bread. This decision aroused surprisingly little criticism in Tehran, but in at least one provincial town the authorities failed to enforce the new price in the face of popular opposition. 16. The bread supply in the provinces remained generally insecure. In the west, sources of supply, which had remained inaccessible during the winter months, became available again in the spring, whilst imported wheat and millet were also despatched in small quantities to eke out local supplies. In the south, Bushire is being fed entirely on imported grain and supplies have also been sent to Shiraz, Kerman and Yezd, but transport difficulties, not to mention the theft of one consignment on the road by the Persian army, have impeded the fulfilment of the original programme for the supply of imported cereals to these provincial deficit areas. Fortunately, the prospects of an excellent harvest, combined with the removal of the threat of a German invasion through the Caucasus, have brought considerable supplies of grain on to the free market in most areas, and where the Persian Government themselves have failed to supply a town with sufficient good bread, all except the very poor have generally been able to buy supplies of “ free ” bread, at not unreasonable prices. 17. Arrangements to collect sufficient of the new grain crop to meet the requirements of Tehran and the large towns, estimated at 300,000 tons for the whole of next year, have been put in train. landlords have been required as in previous years to give undertakings to deliver their surplus crops to the Govern ment at a price fixed at 3,000 rials a ton, with special prices in the frontier districts. In order to settle the amount of these undertakings at a fair level, thecrops in certain important areas have been assessed by special survey officials working under the supervision of our consular liaison officers. In Khuzistan, where the harvest has already been gathered, landlords have undertaken to deliver some 8,500 tons, at a price which has been fixed at 4,000 rials a ton with a view to discouraging the smuggling of grain into Iraq. 18. The cultivators’ share of the crop has been excluded from the scope of tie official collection scheme, but the Persian Government is hoping to purchase a large proportion of it either directly or through commission agents, making use 1 where possible of sugar, tea, cloth and other barter goods in part payment. In ' some districts, especially where the Government nas previously experienced difficulty in enforcing undertakings, arrangements have also been set on foot to buy up the landlords’ surplus, not by enforcing the undertakings system, but by means of ordinary civil contracts between the Government and individual land lords, or commission agents empowered to purchase from them, with the sole proviso that the contracted quantities from any given area shall be greater than the amounts which would have been due under the legal undertaking. Our consular liaison officer in Shiraz has arranged contracts of this kind for the delivery of 30,000 tons of wheat and barley, and negotiations are in hand for the whole of the surplus crop in the Sistan area in East Persia to be bought up by a reliable British-Indian commission agent who made successful purchases on Government behalf in the same area last year. 19. Although the exceptionally good spring rains have been offset in many areas by indifferent sowings, it seems likely that sufficient grain will be harvested this summer to remove the two principal incentives to hoarding : fear of scarcity and hope of speculative profit. At the same time the heavy crops in Iraq may be . expected to diminish the loss of grain by smuggling. It seems, in fact, reasonable to hope that the Ministry of Supply, aided in the provinces by our consular liaison officers, on whom it has become increasingly dependent, as well as by the officers now being lent from the Syrian grain purchasing organisation, of i whom two have already arrived, will succeed in collecting sufficient grain to feed . the towns of Persia next year without recourse to Allied help. Some fears have ' {been expressed that grain collection will be adversely affected by the introduction of the new income tax law, on the assumption that landlords will refuse to declare their real surpluses in order to avoid these being used as the basis of tax assessment. • y I T rans'port. 20 . It becomes more and more apparent that this is the bottle-neck in most forms of economic activity. During the period under review the contact between the Allied supply authorities and the Persian administration has increased by the setting up of new committees whose scope it is to see how best the needs of local agriculture, industry and trade can be met. In each case transport has been found to be the primary need. Contact between these committees (on which the Millspaugh Mission is represented) and the Road Transport Board has enabled many transport problems to be solved. The latter has worked contin uously, in contact with the Persian Government Road Transport Department whose activities it directs. As the control of motor transport tightened, the expected opposition from merchants and the transport trade arose; it was most virulent, and so general that even the Government and the Prime Minister showed signs of joining it. The Anglo-American authorities, however, presented a firm front against this attempt to break up the control, by threatening to cut off supplies of new vehicles and tyres if the control was sabotaged. The attacks were then concentrated against the British director of the Road Transport Department, whose personal reputation was involved; and a situation has arisen which makes it necessary to replace him as soon as a suitable successor can be found. In spite of these vicissitudes it has been possible to introduce a semblance of organ isation into road transport and to divert transport from unessential work to the task of collecting cereals, of fighting locusts, and of carrying essential foodstuffs, fuel for industrial and civilian consumption, &amp;c. 21. The Road Transport Department now has about 500 lease-lend motor trucks and 1,000 contracted motor trucks. In one month it carried 25,000 tons of goods to 423 destinations, half being for the Government and half for mer chants, and half of the goods carried being foodstuffs. Still more vehicles are necessary to fulfil plans for the collection of the cereal harvest, to supply the needs of industry (especially the sugar industry, which has a heavy programme of sugar-beet transport) and to distribute elementary commodities such as tea, sugar and cotton piece-goods throughout the country. [43—41J B 322 . Deliveries by the railway of civil goods, in particular oil, have greatly improved. The following space on the railway has been allotted :— Tons per day. Cereals Sugar and tea Other goods Oil This total daily tonnage carried, which excludes supplies to Russia and other non-civil traffic, probably exceeds the whole tonnage carried by the line before it was taken over by the British Army. Nevertheless the Persian Government still complains that not enough is being carried A request has now been made to carry a large quantity of dates from the south, but this request is believed to have been inspired by influential speculators rather than by responsible supply officials. 130 34 620 Civil Supplies. 23. Shortage of shipping caused by military needs necessitated a drastic reduction of import quotas earlier in the year. Even so, the real limit to the amount of goods coming into the country remained the capacity of the ports and of inland transport to receive and distribute them. Much hardship was caused by the scarcity of imported commodities, and this helped to increase the cost of living. Repeated representations were made on this subject by the Persian Government and, at a recent conference to fix Middle East import quotas, the British and American representatives from Tehran put up a strong case to the Middle East Supply Centre, Cairo. As a result, Persian quotas of motor trans port and other essential supplies were increased. It is now planned further more to move about 8,000 tons of civil goods each month (including cereals) up the railway. These movements will take place after consultation with the Price Stabilisation Section of the Ministry of Finance and it should be possible to ensure that those goods are carried which will (a) supply essential needs and (b) help to stabilise prices. 24. A useful system of committees now operates. Under the Anglo- American Combined Supplies Committee and its Executive Cotnmittee there exist sub-committees dealing with agriculture, industry, chemicals and mining, and medical supplies. All these work closely with the Road Transport Board. Through them increasing contact has been made with the Persian Administration and private industry; and. they serve as a link with the Middle East Supply Centre, Olla and the other Allied organisations concerned with civil supplies. The Middle East Supply Centre, Tehran, continue to play an important part in arranging and controlling imports to Persia from countries under British or American control, and in encouraging local development of agriculture, mining ' and industry. The Russians have been offering more goods than before in an j effort to obtain rials and intend evidently to develop this trade regardless of i Middle East Supply Centre—and of Persian Government control. Tribal Situation — Fars. 25. The gradual elimination by Nasir Qasljgai of the authority of the Persian Government from large parts of Fars is well known. All semblance of this authority had disappeared from a large area, centred on Firuzabad, of which he was in undisputed control. It was clear that he was consolidating his position and acquiring more adherents among landowners and peasants, who, since the Government were unable to protect them, had, under the threat of pillage, no alternative to conciliating Nasir. Numerous approaches by the Government not only failed to persuade Nasir, stiffened certainly by the Germans who were known to be with him and by pro-German elements in Tehran, to accept terms consistent Avith the recognition of the Central Government, but rather increased his prestige. His successful, if polite, defiance encouraged other dissident tribal chiefs to show a bold front, and this resulted in a rapid weakening of Government authority over a widening area extending to the oilfields, and to'an increase in lawlessness and insecurity which could hardly fail in time to affect our interests. In Bakhtiari a young Khan, Abul Qasim, had set himself up in defiance of Govern ment with pretensions to be ruler of Bakhtiari, and had collected a band of armed followers which allowed him to exact money and grain from Bakhtiari villages.7 ( 4 In April, at his instigation attacks were made on Persian garrisons in the Janiki country sufficiently close to the oilfields at Masjidi Suleiman and Haft Kel to cause a temporary anxiety for their safety. 26. At the end of last year General Headquarters, Paiforce, were concerned about the safety of the Bushire-Shiraz road, which it was, at that time, intended to use to a greater extent for the transport of supplies to Russia. Although there been no serious interference with our military traffic, a series of minor rob- p ties and hold-ups had hampered the work being done by our engineers on the improvement and maintenance of the road, and had created some anxiety among labourers and transport drivers. It was evident that there would be no real security on the road until the Persian Government had established some respect for their authority in Pars, and that this could not be achieved as long as Nasir Qashgai continued in defiance. The Persian forces in Pars were demoralised after a long period of inaction and were immobile through lack of transport. It was agreed with General Headquarters, Paiforce, that the Persian Government should be urged to take more decisive measures to ensure the security of the road and to re-establish their authority over the Qashgai tribes. General Headquarters, I aiforce, undertook to supply the minimum amount of mechanical transport considered essential for the operations, to provide basic rations, blankets and greatcoats for the gendarmerie protecting the road, in the hope that this would lead to a more efficient performance of their duties, and to send to Shiraz a small staff of British officers for liaison with the Persian troops, and the supervision of the use and maintenance of this transport and the issue of the rations. The Persian Government decided to appoint General Shahbakhti, an officer of the old school with a reputation to maintain for courage, energy and astuteness in dealing with the tribes, with full civil and military powers in Pars. The mere announce ment of his appointment had on the tribal situation an immediate effect which, however, wore off as weeks passed in inaction. 27. There may at first have been some justification for this inaction in the delay in the arrival of the transport promised by Paiforce, without which, it is probably true, General Shahbakhti was unable to act; but the delav was unfortu nate in that the pro-German party, whose tool Nasir was, headed by the Deputy Nowbakht, had time to work up a considerable agitation in Parliament and press in favour of Nasir and against “ fratricidal warfare.” That we had pressed the Persian Government to undertake these operations, that we were providing assist ance and that British officers were in Pars to see that they were carried out was well known, and the agitation inevitably assumed a strongly anti-British bias. Only traitors, it was said, would lend themselves to British designs against the patriotic Na.sir, whose father had so successfully foiled all British attempts to take possession of Pars. This agitation had a harmful effect on the never very firm decision of the Persian Government, which quickly communicated itself to General Shahbakhti and the forces in Pars; and it was not until the end of May— General Shahbakhti having arrived in Shiraz in February—that he allowed him self to be persuaded that the Government really meant him to act. After an initial set-back the first stage of the operations, of which the object was the occupation of Firuzabad and other important places in the area dominated by Nasir, was successfully completed by the 12 th June. 28. As was expected, as soon as it was realised that the Government really meant business, organised opposition rapidly disintegrated, and Nasir, with an unknown but probably not large number of followers and, according to local reports, two Germans, is now in hiding in the hills. The Persian Air Force is using the landing ground at Farrashband prepared bv Nasir and the Germans for the arrival of German aircraft. Un less th e Pers ian authorities mishandle thing's bajly the power and prestige of Nasir should now be definitelv broken; sporadic raiding may be expected to occur for some time yet, but if the Persian Govern ment show even a moderate degree of firmness and statesmanship they have an opportunity of making a settlement with the Qashgai tribes that would induce them to be well-behaved for some time. The matter will soon be of less import- ance to our military interests as it is not intended to use the Bushire-Isfahan road for the transport of supplies to Russia after July, but from the economic point of view the restoration of order in tribal areas is of great importance. 29. By their successful challenge of Nasir’s bluff the Persian Government \ has restored something of its lost prestige among the tribes of the South and the effect is already apparent. If the present Prime Minister, who also holds the portfolio of the Interior, could spare time from his manoeuvrings to keep himself in power, to consider how best advantage can be taken of the present favourable position vis-a-vis the tribes, he has the opportunity of establishing better relations with them which might go far towards eliminating the causes of tribal unrest. Y Tc - k. i \ rid OuIm ^ ' •8 Persian A rmy. SO. No real progress has been made with the reform of the Persian army which remains on the whole demoralised, underpaid, underfed, and discontented. Its senior officers embezzle in increasing degree the funds allotted to them for the upkeep and feeding of their troops and animals; its junior officers steal what they can to keep themselves and their families alive. 31. General Ridley’s scheme, whereby payment and supply will be - drawn from the control of commanders and centralised in depots at each provin cial headquarters, to be supervised by American officers and controlled directly b} the War Office, meets with much opposition. A beginning has been made in Tehran, but even after the implementation of the scheme had been initiated with the Shah’s approval, General Ridley met with so little co-operation from the General Staff that he felt obliged to threaten to inform his Government that it was useless for him and his mission to remain here. 32. The Shah continues to insist on his right to exercise executive control of the army, even in matters of detail, and on the direct responsibility of the General Staff to him as Commander-in-chief rather than to the Government. There is continual discord and very little co-operation between the Chief of the General Staff, who is determined to limit the influence and control of the American advisers to the minimum that will avert their resignation, and the Minister for War, who, perhaps not entirely for altruistic reasons, would welcome a degree of control by the American advisers that would restrict the embezzlement of army funds and limit the pow r er of the General Staff. The Shah gives no greater support to the American advisers than does his Chief of the General Staff. On -'y A er) ^ Ih 0 9 n e hand he is unwilling to admit that he and his officers have any need of foreign advice; on the other, while aware of the need for reform, he fears to initiate or support any action that would be unpopular with those senior officers on whose attachment to himself he mistakenly relies for the maintenance of his position. The most flagrant cases of neglect of duty or w T orse go unpunished. 33. General Ridley works with great patience and perseverance. His staff has recently been increased by three American officers, making a total of six in addition to himself, and he has asked the United States Government for more. But his position, his responsibilities and his powers are still undefined, and the terms of his contract are still under discussion with Washington. If he can obtain a band of Persian officers of his own choosing to w r ork w T ith him he may yet be able to effect satisfactory reforms. 34. Without those reforms it is certain that the large credits allotted this year to the army —100 million tomans—will be largely wasted. The credit would be justified if the funds were to be devoted to the purposes for which they have been demanded—the payment of a living w^ge to junior officers and the adequate feeding oj the men, essential preliminaries to the creation of a disciplined army of sufficient strength and efficiency to restore order throughout the country and so permit an ultimate reduction in military expenditure. But apart from the wastage due to fraud there is useless extravagance on establishments that serve no useful purpose in present conditions, as, for example, a Staff College teaching pre-war French theories. Such vain trimmings the Shah pretends are essential f o maintain the morale of his officers, whereas they merely pander to their vanity * and distract them from the tasks before them—the necessity for the fundamental reform of administration and the restoration of order in their own country. 35. There is perhaps a slight improvement in the sentiments of the Persian army towards the British. In Pars and in Khuzestan assistance given to the Persian troops by the British military. authorities has been appreciated. The visit of six Persian officers to Cairo and the El Alamein battlefields in March- April had an excellent effect; His Majesty s Government’s offer to train twelve Persian air force officers in England was very well received, and a request has been made by the Persian Minister for War that Persian officers should be allowed to attend courses of instruction in Mid East. Engineers’ Strike. 36. Towards the end of the government of Qawam es Saltaneh differences arose between the engineers of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Government with regard to conditions of employment. The demands of the engineers related to their salaries, and also to the control of technical affairs and departments concerned with technical matters, which they maintained should be m their hands. A Bill on the subject had been prepared but, with the fall of the Government, it had not been pursued. The engineers became more and more9 dissatisfied and eventually a number of them went on strike in the early part of April. 37. The Government having failed to negotiate with the engineers, the strike began to spread : agricultural engineers of the Ministry of Agriculture and a group of professors and teachers of the Ministry of Education joined in. Various promises were held out by the Government to the strikers but as, by the i^^dle of May, no settlement of the problem appeared to be within sight, repre- seixcations were made by His Majesty's Legation to the Prime Minister who succeeded in bringing about a compromise with regard to the agricultural engineers and the teachers. The other engineers, however, still remained unsatis fied and their case was referred to Dr. Millspaugh. In a public statement issued on the 31st May, Dr. Millspaugh made it clear that he could authorise no increase in the salaries of the engineers unless a similar increase were authorised in the salaries of other Government employees. He went on to attribute various motives to the strikers, one of which was that they were acting under the influence of political agitators. This statement was immediately interpreted by the Council of the Representatives of the Engineers and University Teachers as evidence of Dr. Millspaugh’s intention to arrogate to himself the right to interfere in the political affairs of the country. It was also seized on as a weapon to attack Dr. Millspaugh by those who were anxious to prevent the passage of his Income lax Bill. Eventually the strike was brought to a conclusion by the personal intervention of the Shah, who gave orders that the claims of the engineers and teachers were to be attended to. Various appointments which have since been made in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and in the Ministry of Communications indicate that the engineers’ claim to have a greater say in the control of technical departments is, in fact, being satisfied. Press. 38. After the suppression of twelve of the more extreme papers during the latter part of April and the beginning of May, the general tone of the press became quieter and no more directly anti-British articles appeared. Other factors, notably the improvement in the food situation and the victory in North Africa, no doubt contributed to this. In commenting on the war situation the press in general has adopted a more favourable attitude towards ourselves and our Allies. Although the majority of the suppressed papers have since re appeared under their own or other names, the energies of the press as a whole have been devoted largely to attacking their own Parliament, Cabinet and Prime Minister and to discussing internal affairs such as the new Income Tax Bill and the coming elections. The Income lax Bill has received the strong support of the left-wing papers but has been vehemently attacked by papers representing vested interests. A particularly violent attack on the Prime Minister and the Deputies, in which the latter were accused of being entirelv unrepresentative of the people led to the resuppression of two papers on the 13th June. Shortly afterwards the Deputies met in secret session and, as a result, the Prime Minister placed a Bill before the Majlis on the 17th June which, if it had been accepted, would have reduced the number of Tehran papers from approximately thirty-five to seven. In open debate the Bill met with lively opposition and it was then withdrawn. Anglo-Persian Relief Committee. 39. The Anglo-Persian Relief Fund Committee has continued its work m providing meals, clothing and medical relief to the destitute in the lar°er provincial towns in the British zone. Full publicity has been given to this work in wireless broadcasts and in the press, and it has undoubtedly had a favourable influence on our popularity in some circles, especially in the southern provinces In addition to the total of £40,000 contributed to the fund by His Majesty’s Government, donations have been received from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (£5,000), and the Imperial Bank of Persia (£1,000). ' The Persian merchants of Ahwaz have made the record contribution of over £5,000 to the local branch of the fund. 40. While dealing with the subject of relief mention must be made of the medical relief afforded to the Persian population by the British military authorities. The provision (mentioned in my despatch No. 139) of a large typhus hospital for Persian civilian patients, complete with equipment and staff has undoubtedly had the happiest effect on public opinion, and the travelling dispensary which is now on tour in the Kermanshah district is making an excellent impression. This legation has recommended to the Minister of State10 that more dispensaries should be provided for Persia if possible. It is note worthy that the Soviet authorities have, since the typhus hospital was opened, announced a considerable expansion of their medical aid to the local population in their zone and have established a 50-bed hospital in Tehran, staffed by Russian doctors, for Persian patients. The British Council. 41. The British Council started an “ Anglo-Persian Institute” in Tehran early in the year, and its official opening was most successfully celebrated last week in a series of three receptions attended by over 1,500 people. Regular classes in English have, however, been held since February last. These classes have aroused even greater interest than was expected. Thousands of applications for enrolment were received, and although the institute was at first seriously handicapped by shortage of staff, the situation has now improved and the number of native English teachers is expected to be increased to eight in the very near future. There are now 30 classes, comprising 320 Persian students of both sexes, and about 150 more Persians are members of the library, which is already tolerably well stocked. The Persian authorities are giving the institute every encourage ment and M. Hussein Ala has accepted the chairmanship of an advisory committee which includes two members of the Government, the Under-Secretary for War and other Persian notabilities, in addition to the counsellor to His Majesty’s Legation and representatives of the British community. The Minister of Education and His Majesty’s Minister are ex officio patrons of the institute. 42. The activities of the council in Tehran are meeting a long-felt need and the enthusiasm which they have aroused is proportionately great. They constitute probably the best of all forms of propaganda, and it is earnestly hoped that every encouragement will be given to their further development both in Tehran and in the provinces. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s Minister of State at Cairo, and to Minbraneh at Bagdad, to Paiforce, Bagdad, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Kuibyshev. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD.SECRET Notes for Registry. ''Pa. CO.o. 19 4* * Initials. Under Secretary... Secretary of State Committee 30* 6 /. vU yfk A Under Secretary...

The Shah spoke of the present bad conditions under which the peasantry live, and sketched the reforms he is contemplating both for the immediate future and for the postwar period. Mr, Casey emphasised the dangers of the financial and economic situation and urged that the Persian Covemment should tackle the problem firmly and resolutely. With regard to Persia's relations with the Allies, the Shah showed himself much exercised over the growth of Russian influence, and said that on the other hand the British were becoming increasingly unpopular. This he ascribed to the fact that British assistance had always come too late. He deplored the Allied policy which led/ Wt.42601/P.281 3,000 1/42 A.«fe KW.Ud. Up. 685&amp;9-.'

Record of a Conversation with the Shah, loth April, 1943. I HiVD a private conversation lasting an hour and three-quarters with the Shah to-day. Mr. Hopkinson was also present. His Majesty was extremelv friendly, and, as I had found him before, simple and straightforward. The following are the main points which emerged from the discussion :— ( 1 ) Social Reforms. The Shah said that he attached the greatest importance to the carrying out of effective reforms in Persia. If people were poor and had no stake in the country, there was no incentive among them to resist external aggression. Of the 17 million population of Persia probably not more than 20,000 were able to lead decent lives. The conditions of the peasantry are now so bad that they might easily lead to actual revolt. He was considering plans both for immediate execution and for the post-war period. As regards the present, he was encouraging a proposal that three-fifths of he yield of the land tilled by the peasants should be handed back to them, and only two-fifths given to the landlord, instead of, as in the past, in some cases only one-fifth being left to the peasants. As regards the future, he had plans for breaking up the large estates and distributing them to the peasants on a co-operative basis. At the moment only some 20,000 persons in the country could be said to be living a tolemble existence. Certain landowners had properties which were practically whole provinces. There was no reason for any man to own more than two estates. I said that reforms of this nature, which entailed considerable expenditure on the part of the State, were things, in my mind, for the post-war period, as the country had very great economic and financial burdens at present. The Shah agreed that such reforms could not be carried out in war time, when the country could not stand too great shocks. c * (2) Economic and Financial Affairs. I emphasised strongly to His Majesty the dangers of the immediate financial • and economic situation. It was essential that the Persian Government should face up to the problem and take drastic steps to put their house in order. The present economic and financial drift had to be gripped and checked. I referred to the Bill before the Majlis for the grant of powers to Dr. Millspaugh. and to the imperative necessity of taking effective measures for collecting this year’s wheat crop. The Shah agreed, and said that he thought Dr. Millspaugh’s powers would soon be granted by the Majlis. As regards the wheat scheme, there was a plan by which the Government should take 60 per cent, of the crop, leaving 40 per cent, to the owner or cultivator to dispose of as he wished. Mr. Sheridan was not entirely in accord with this. The Shah pointed out that Government intervention in regard to the collection of wheat, e.g., in Khorassan and Kerman, had led to [41-54.] 6c, t2 immediate wholesale hoarding. It was possible that it would be better to leave the wheat producers to collect and sell their grain themselves. He believed that a compromise between the two might be the best solution. I referred to the need for increasing taxation in order to balance the budget and to reduce inflation. The Shah said that Dr. Millspaugh was considering a scheme of taxation intended to limit incomes to a maximum figure. This was all to the good, but he doubted whether any Government would be able to collect the money. He referred to the increase of rials in circulation, and begged that steps might be taken to enable the Persian Government to bring to Persia the large stock of gold which had accumulated in South Africa. (3) Relations with Russia. Tlofc OoJ fKlA The Shah was obviously extremely exercised over the increasing Russian influence in Persia, and, in particular, of the threat of communism. He referred to the Russian gift of 25.000 tons of wheat, which he said was a Bolshevik and not a Russian gesture. In the same way. the conduct of the Russian troops here he described as a means of propaganda on behalf of communism. He gave the I example of two Russian officers who two nights before had rescued two Persian girls from four drunken Americans. He also referred to the shooting of four men and two women by British Indian troops this morning. I undertook to look into this matter, which from his account seemed to be serious. He said that pe?' contra the British were becoming increasingly unpopular. There was a tendency to blame the British for everything. Accusations were made against the U.K.C.C. drivers and unknown Jews in Tehran and elsewhere who bought up produce and goods (for resale at higher prices) in the name of the British authorities. It would be much better if the British authorities should ask the Persian Govern ment to do all their buying for them. Then they would not be accused of starving the country by buying up all local produce. I said that this w T as a point which had arisen elsewhere in the Middle East, and that I would look into the possibility of establishing a buying authority. The Shah said that the trouble with Brutish assistance had always been that it came too late. It was far better to give a little help before a disaster took place than a great deal afterwards. He referred to the lack of any real public opinion in Persia. Thus power tended to be concentrated in the press, and the newspaper reading public believed all the lies appearing in the press. I mentioned that I had spoken very frankly with the representatives of the press last night. The Shah had evidently already heard of this. (4) Anglo-Persian Relations. The Shah said that he wished to discuss the future of Anglo-Persian .relations. He was most anxious that this should be settled now and that we should not wait until the end of the war. Otherwise he feared that by the time the Peace Conference came Persia would have become too weak to withstand outside aggression, even though he was perfectly aware that the British Government wanted to see a strong and independent Persia. He himself had greatly regretted the Allied policy which had led up to the events of August 1941. He denied that there was any truth in the assertion that the Persian Government at that time had been pro-German. They had proved this during the Ali Rashid revolt—a • period of great British weakness—when Persia -had not moved. No attempt had been made to blow up oil installations at Abadan or Kermanshah. On the contrary, half the Persian forces and a number of their limited stock of anti-aircraft guns had been moved down to protect the oil-fields. No attempt either had been made I at aggression against Russia, a fact proved by the withdrawal of Persian troops * I into the interior. Against this, all that Persia had received was the joint Anglo- ^ Russian note, couched in rather vague terms, asking for the removal of the German fifth column. If Britain at that time had offered to make a firm alliance with Persia—even a military alliance—it would have been accepted by the Persian Government. With such an agreement, concluded under honourable conditions, Persia would have formed a useful bulwark behind Turkey, which at that time was very shaky. He had no doubt that the Government then could have enforced such a policy in the country. However, no such agreement was mooted. When he came to the throne he realised at once that a strong alliance with Britain was essential for the future of Persia. He had been very much in favour of the Tripartite Alliance being a genuine military alliance which, even if it had cost Persian lives, would have cemented the country both internally and externally. Owing to the Persian3 Government’s weakness of policy that was not done. Nevertheless, Persia had contributed a great deal towards the Allied cause, mainly through aid to Russia, the effect of which in the South Russian campaign might even turn out to have been decisive. Persia had also suffered a great deal, and she had not, in fact, received full credit for what she had done. Persia could, of course, now join the United Nations and definitely come into the war, but this would only be a gesture, and would do nothing to make the country strong against the day when '*xthe Peace Conference opened. Mr. Churchill had told him, when he visited Tehran, that he wanted to deal with a Persia which was a strong and independent Power. He believed Mr. Churchill’s words, and attached great importance to them. He would like to see Anglo-Persian relations placed at once on a firm basis with an eye to the future. He asked whether British policy in Persia was conducted from London or Delhi. I replied that, of course, our policy emanated from London, and he said that in that case there was some hope. It was a well- known political principle, he continued, that a foreign Power would always wish to profit from the internal weakness of a neighbouring State. He did not know whether there were elements seeking to promote dissensions in Persia, but he did beg that we should consider the means of adjusting our relations w r ith Persia at once so as to strengthen her for the future. It was a question of national morale, not only of finance and economics. When I questioned him as to how this could be done, he said that he did not know what the external policy of his Majesty's Government (he obviously had in mind Russia) might be. He had little concrete to suggest, but was obviously feeling after some form of closer association with Britain which would act as a block against Russian Communist penetmtion. One thing, which he thought would help, would be the raising of the status of the legation to that of an embassy. He had spoken to the Duke of Gloucester about this, but he had since been told that nothing could be done until after the war. The present situation, he said, was entirely illogical; the Russians had had an embassy for many years. Even the Yugoslavs in London now had an Ambassador, and the Americans had accepted a Persian Ambassador in Washington. This is evidently a point on which he feels strongly, and I think that we should seriously consider the possibility of meeting him over this. kc&gt;j&amp; rl/- CaSey CorJuJ&amp;t 7k uaua*aj&gt;&amp;( '/vMdUOf dj- (5) Internal Affairs. The Shah said that the hope of the country lay in the hands of the young— in ideas and not necessarily only m age. He referred to a movement and what he described as “ le type des jeunes ” which he said was growing, and encouragement must be given to them, but even they were now being described as instruments of British policy because Mr. Harold Nicholson in a broadcast from London had referred to the need for “ young men rallying around their young King.” I asked His Majesty whether he was aware of the creation of an Anglo-Persian Institute here, and told himjhat when classes were opened for instruction in English language there had been 2.000 applications. It had, of course, been quite impos sible to deal with such a number owing to the lack of teachers, but I thought that it was a significant and encouraging development for the future. His Majesty had not heard of the institute, and expressed the greatest interest. The Shah concluded by referring again to the need for strengthening Anglo-Persian relations at once. R G. CASEY.

With the Compliments of the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Section 2. Copy No* 1X9 Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden. -(Received 21*/ May.) (No. 170.) &amp;ir, Tehran', 3rd May, 1943. IN my teleg ram No. 232 d ated the 1 st March, I suggested’* that we had perhaps shown excessive loyalty to the principle of aporipium aid to Russia, in that we had brought upon ourselves not only positive criticism from the Persians but also comparisons with tne Russians highly unfavourable to our selves. All this, however, was our own doing. In the pre^ntfdespatch I propose to examine the attitude and acts of the Soviet authorises ill Pir&amp;ia,-. and to see whether any deduction can be drawn from them as to the long-term policy of Soviet Russia in regard to this country and to its effect on Persia. 2 . Soon after the occupation of August 1941 the Soviet Government asked the Persian Government to agree to the opening of a large number of Soviet consular posts in various parts of the country. In the earlier years after the last war there were some fifteen such posts, including the southern towns of Isfahan, Kerman and Shiraz. All except one were, I believe, closed in about 1938, when the Soviet Government closed down nearly all the foreign consulates in the Soviet Union; and at the time of the occupation there was only one Persian Consulate in Russia (Baku),' and only one Soviet Consulate in Persia (Pahlevi). The Persian Government tried to resist the demand for the reopening of so many consulates, basing its attitude on the principle of reciprocity, but secured nothing but the shadowy hope of an extension of Persian consular representation in the Soviet Union after the war; and eventually they had to acquiesce in the appointment of such consular officials as the Soviet Embassy liked to notify to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. There is, however, littfe evidence to show that these consular officers abuse their functions overtly. If the Soviet consular representatives in Tabriz and Meshed and other places in the Russian zone exercise considerable influence over the local authorities that is balanced by the influence of His Majesty’s consular officers elsewhere. The Soviet Consulate in Isfahan seems to cultivate the poorer classes of the population, but we, ourselves, are interested in the hitherto badly-treated factory population of that town. Soviet Consuls in Kermanshah and Ahwaz have perhaps shown more interest in the tribes than is necessary for their work, and the staff of the former have toured a good deal among the Kurds and are reported to have given assurances of friendship—certainly to have gone farther than His Majesty's Consul-General at Tabriz has gone in his strictly correct dealings with the Kurds in his district. Moreover, the Soviet Consul at Kermanshah, on one occasion, allowed his training in propaganda for orien|«4 peoples to get the better of his discretion : he is reported to have tried so; le highly characteristic anti-imperialist propaganda on an Indian Moslem offic and, although he denied this, the origin and character of the Indian officer ccjnP cerned, and the fact that he is a Moslem, whereas the Soviet Consul represent itfc him as hoping for a Japanese victory, make it certain in my opinion that t iH officer’s report was correct. &gt;~ 3. It will be remembered that on their entry into northern Persia t igj Soviet authorities disarmed the Persian police and gendarmerie, and refused t&lt;*£} allow any Persian troops to be stationed in their zone. The unarmed polii'^ and gendarmerie were unable to keep order, but whenever an appeal was ma le to the Soviet authorities to assist it was rejected on the ground that the Soviet authorities had undertaken not to interfere in the internal affairs of Pers a^j Gradually and grudgingly the Persian Government were allowed to rearm number of police and gendarmerie, though the Persian Government alwa r maintained that the number allowed was insufficient. Eventually, the Sovi; authorities permitted a small body of Persian troops to be stationed iP 1 Azerbaijan, though with little liberty of movement until perhaps quite recent y It is difficult to believe that this policy was due to fear; the Russians are t&amp;T well acquainted with Persian poltroonery for that. It is significant that the Co/Vy £ 7 wi .7 ^OAOC^rn- Kussians were most difficult in this matter in Azerbaijan, where the wea kening of the Central Government miu, h t be expected to be p l easing to the local popula - tTon who are mainly of the same race and language as~the inhabitants oi Soviet Azerbaijan and who tend to regard the Government at Tehran not only as exploiters but as aliens too. If Russian policy has in effect tended to encourage the growth of an autonomist or even a separatist movement in Azerbaijan, this would hardly be repugnant to the Soviet Government. C 4 . At first the Soviet authorities encouraged the Kurds, even to the extent of inviting several of the leaders to see the glories of Soviet Russia as found in Baku. Recently, however, they abandoned this policy, and it seems probable that the change was due mainly to the discovery that Soviet Russia had nothing to fear from Turkey and therefore would not need Kurdish help against the Turks, though the Russians may also have been influenced by the fact that in of course of ‘certain Kurdish “atrocities’' at Rezaieh in the spring of 1942, the chief sufferers were the Turki-speaking Shias, i.e., precisely the element which would necessarily be the nucleus of any movement against the Persian Government if one should ever develop. This sudden abandonment of the Kurds after a period of cosseting is in complete accordance with the realistic nature of Soviet principles and recalls the crash with which, when President Roosevelt renewed diplomatic relations with Russia, the Soviet authorities abandoned, half finished, the film which was to have told the world of the horror of lynching in the United States, and left the American negro actors open-mouthed at this sudden neglect. 5. The Russians have also taken up the Armenians and have so far shown no tendency to drop them. Reza Shah closed down the Armenian schools; Sawaz- al-Saltanah allowed them to be reopened, and there is no doubt that this was done under pressure from the Soviet Embassy. The Bashnaks, who were inclined to be pro-German, seem to have been brought to heel, and it would seem that most of the Armenians in Persia are now pro-Russian, at least, in the north. Being a pervasive if small minority, their influence is considerable, and since they may well tear that the Persians would like to take revenge on the Christian minorities after the war, for real or alleged collaboration with the invader, they are likely to wish to retain the protection of the Soviet Government. 6 . In financial and economic affairs, the policy of the Soviet Government affords a striking contrast to our own; it has been less frank and honest, yet it has possibly been a greater political success. When we were struggling for months to secure, by straightforward means, enough local currency to carry on the common war effort, the Russians were acquiring rials by methods which weakened the Persian Government but won private friends for themselves. In that they failed to a large extent to keep their promise to hand over Soviet goods to the Persian Government against the large credit of about £500.000 which they had extorted, they helped to embarrass the Government and to increase inflation; but when they sold these goods to wholesalers or retailers or individuals at the market price, they not only benefited by the taxes or monopoly dues which ought to have gone to the Government, but they used a political weapon of great power, since commodities such as sugar and piece-goods are so scarce that any Persian who can secure a supply is likely to regard the supplier with great favour. There is little doubt that the Russians have secured many friends by this preferential treatment, while we, in our desire to assist the Persian Government and to prevent speculation and hoarding, have been stiff with the private trader and have encouraged the concentration of essential goods in the hands of the Government, in the hope that this would lead to a fairer distribu tion and to some check on the rise in prices. At the present time the Soviet authorities are paying customs dues on some goods which they import, but not, it is believed, on all. 7. The effect of Soviet policy on the flow of supplies from the richer northern part of Persia to less favoured parts of the country outside the Soviet zone has been much debated. The Soviet authorities refer rather unctuously to their policy of non-interference, which is an implied criticism of British policy. It is a fact that whereas we have assisted the Persian authorities not only to collect wheat for local centres, but to obtain wheat for Tehran from some of those centres, thereby incurring at times the accusation that we were taking the wheat for ourselves, the Russians have done nothing to encourage the local authorities in Azerbaijan to collect the large surplus of wheat which might have furnished a three or four-months’ supply of bread for Tehran. It was to be expected that this would win the favour of the hoarders in Azerbaijan, and even of the ordinary inhabitant, who does not wish to be “exploited ” by the capital, but it has even3 O \ redounded to the credit of the Russians in the very area which is half starved for lack of Azerbaijan grain, the argument being that the existence of larger food supplies in the Russian zone must be due to the greater humanity and forbearance of the Russians—or to British purchases of food in the south. Apart from the major question of the wheat of Azerbaijan, it is not easy to obtain positive evidence as to the policy of the Russians in regard to food-stuffs, but I am convinced that, although some acts of apparent obstruction have been due to the truculence of individual officers and to the fact well known to foreign officials in Soviet Russia, that there is always a Captain Ivanov who hasn't received any orders, the Russians have more than once held up exports of food-stuffs from their zone to Tehran when they wished to secure some concession from the Persian Government, and that they have prevented the export of sheep, ghi, eggs and other food-stuffs and of charcoal, either to keep these commodities for their own consumption (at a relatively low price), or to maintain supplies for the local population and to keep them content. 8 . It is difficult to believe that the recent offer of 25,000 tons of wheat by the Soviet Government to the Persian Government was not planned with the object of damaging us as well as securing credit for the Soviet Government. We had consulted the Soviet authorities in all matters relating to supplies, and invited them to sign the Food Agreement of December last, even though at the time there was no prospect whatever that they would, in fact, be able to supply any grain to Persia; yet they gave us no notice that they were going to offer wheat to Persia—an offer all the more improbable in that at that moment the Soviet authorities in Persia were pressing hard for the delivery in Azerbaijan of the balance of grain due under a contract which binds the Persian Government to supply the Soviet army with 5.000 tons of wheat and 15,000 tons of barley. The propaganda aim of the offer is evident from the fact that the Soviet authorities are still insisting on the delivery of the full amounts of wheat and barley, and that they will not allow the Persian Government to deliver to the Red Army in Azerbaijan, in settlement of the balance. Soviet wheat instead of Persian wheat. Finally, it is perhaps not by accident that the Soviet offer was so timed that it was bound to be reported in the press at the same moment as the report of the opening of a British hospital, complete with doctors, nurses and orderlies, for the treatment of Persian typhus patients. 9. It seems that the great harm which British interests have recently suffered in Persia owing to the oil shortage is due in great part to the slackness^— to use no harsher word—of the Soviet authorities. Nothing has injured our interests more than the shortage of kerosene and fuel oil which occurred in March and April. If the demand for kerosene has not been fully met, that is partly due to the fact that it has doubled because kerosene has hardly risen at all in price, whereas the prices of other kinds of fuel have become prohibitive; but the demand for fuel oil, though it has also increased, has not increased to the same extent, and the inability to meet it is due largely to short delivery by the Soviet authorities. They undertook to bring in 150 tons of fuel oil a day for the railways in February and March; they felt short of fulfilment by 1.100 tons in February and 700 tons in March, and to keep the railway running the Americans operating it seized 700 tons of fuel oil consigned to the A.I.O.C. and intended for civilian use. The feeling which the shortage has aroused against the A.I.O.C., who are in no way responsible, and in general against the British, to whom is attributed everything that goes wrong outside the Russian zone, is intense, and will do us harm for many years to come. The failure by the Soviet authorities to deliver the full quota of oil may have been due to force majeure, but the fact that the failure was Russia’s and that, nevertheless, all the blame fell on the A.I.O.C. and His Majesty’s Government cannot be expected to wring withers so tough as those of the Soviet Government. 10. It is not only in the matter of food supplies that we have done most of the work and yet received all the blame. In dealing with suspects, the Soviet authorities have allowed us to work for the benefit of both the Allies, while themselves evading any responsibility in the matter. Being responsible for communications up to Tehran, it follows that we have to maintain security over some two-thirds of Persia. Whenever we have had difficulty with the Persian Government in this respect we have received no help from the Soviet Embassy. On one occasion, when we wished to establish the principle that the Persian Government must hand over to us at Sultanabad for interrogation any suspects for whom we asked, the Soviet Embassy held aloof, and when we proposed to effect ourselves the arrest of several men who were concerned in a plot directed not only against us but against the Russians also, and whose arrest we were afraid [42—7 b 24 to entrust to the Persian Government, the Soviet Ambassador was quite unable to obtain any instructions from Moscow. The fear in w 7 hich Russia is held suffices as a rule to prevent any danger to Russian interests from Persians in the Russian zone, and it the Russian authorities have any suspicion of a Persian officer or official, the Persian Government are requested to remove him, whereupon he is transferred to the area in wffiich the responsibility is ours. Not only do the Russians remain aloof from our security policy and thereby escape any share in the inevitable odium, but they even tried to secure our co-operation in dealing with some persons in Tabriz who w 7 ere believed to be spreading pro-German propaganda. This invitation was refused. 11 . In the time of Reza Shah, Soviet propaganda was kept under as effectively as in Nazi Germany. There w^ere no Soviet films; no Soviet propa ganda—not even Soviet newspapers*—could be sold; and a sharp eye was kept on refugees from Russia, whether the fifty or sixty thousand-odd Persian subjects who migrated to Persia some seven years ago, or the Soviet citizens who entered Persia from time to time on the plea of escaping from Soviet tyranny. Now several cinemas show different Soviet films at the same time, and there is a provincial service of Soviet films so lavish that we are unable to compete with it. The Toss newspaper in Russian has much about Russia, but almost nothing about the British or American w r ar effort, and it is followed in this respect by the Persian organ of the Tudeh party, wffiich is undoubtedly supported by the Soviet authorities. This newspaper recently profited by an unimportant article in an American paper to attribute imperialist aims to Great Britain and the l nited States, and to say how T happy Persia could be in the confidence that Soviet Russia harboured no such designs. Another paper, whose owner confessed to us that he had been obliged to accept a present of newsprint from the Russian Embassy, immediately published an article about the export of sheep from the north, saying that the Russians would certainly allow it if they could be sure that the meat was intended for Persian consumption. A third paper which hap recently attacked us violently was run (it has since been suppressed) by a cynical black mailer who pretends to have been converted to communism. It is difficult to believe that such phenomena have not received the specific approval of persons in touch with the Soviet Embassy, and more than one editor who has been allowed to buy newsprint from the Embassy has spoken of the pressure put upon him to induce him to write articles favourable to Russia. Other evidence of the existence of active Soviet propaganda is hard to find. The official Soviet organisa tions seem to confine themselves to propaganda about the war and about Soviet culture, though His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed has gained the impres sion that the Soviet army is busily engaged in underground political propaganda. Chauffeurs who travel on convoy into and out of the Soviet zone seem to be eager to report how much better conditions are there, and there is some reason to think that this is not spontaneous. . . . 12. One advantage which the Russians enjoy in tnis country is the tear with which they are regarded by the Persians. It has not been forgotten that the Russian advance in the 18th century was effected partly at the expense of Persian sovereignty, and that but for the outbreak of the war of 1914 about one-half and that the richer half—of Persia would sooner or later have become, if not part of Russia, at least in practice a Russian protectorate. If the Persians were somewhat reassured by the treaty of 1921, the ruthlessness with which the Soviet Government exercised its economic power, e.ff-, in closing the C aucasus to the Persian transit trade as a means of coercion, kept the old dread alive. More over, although the behaviour of Soviet Russia until 1939 tallied with its slogan . “ We don’t want an inch of anyone else’s territory; we won’t give up an inch of our own,” the Soviet attitude, since 1939, towards Finland,-Roumama, the Baltic States and Poland has tended to confirm the Persian’s worst fears. Finally, the neatness and despatch with which the Soviet rulers dispose of malcontents m Soviet Russia, coupled with the disappearance in Persia of a number of persons of Caucasian origin who are believed, on good evidence, to have been kidnapped bv the Soviet authorities, suffices to keep the unheroic Persian in a state of respectful awe towards the Russians. This enables the Russians to do with impunity things which they know will be kept secret out of fear, fo conclude an outrageous^ contract for the manufacture of arms and ammunition by the Persian Government for the benefit of Soviet Russia, which requires an outlay by the Persian Government of over £2 million, though the price to be paid for the finished articles has not even been fixed and cannot in any case ever pa\ the Persian Government for that outlay. When the Soviet Ambassador made the recent offer to bring in from Russia 25,000 tons of wheat he urged the PrimeMinister to give this offer immediate publicity, confident that the Prime Minister would not dare to make public at the same time that the Soviet Government still required the execution of the contract for the supply of wheat and barley to the Soviet troops in Azerbaijan. Attacks on Great Britain have been frequent recently, but if Russia is ever mentioned it is with praise. Persian statesmen take this for granted and seem to consider it excusable and natural. The Prime Minister tells me that he recently asked one of the leading journalists in Tehran why he attacked the British and never the Russians, and that the man replied. \ with surprise at being asked such a question : But the Russians are kidnapping j Persians . . . .” I he Poles are frequently attacked for bringing in typhus, j and we for bringing in the Poles. Setting aside the fact that typhus is endemic in this country, it is typical that no Persian ever points out that it was in Russia that the Poles contracted typhus, and that their presence in Russia was no fault of theirs. 13. It is a matter for surprise that the Soviet Government accepted as meekly as any other Government the despotic regime of Reza Shah in Persia, with its complete ban on their propaganda activities. The Counsellor to the Soviet Embassy is credibly reported to have said recently that Soviet Russia is going to take a greater interest in Persia after the war. Two characteristics of the Russian attitude at present towards Persian affairs in general are their support of the I udeh party and their demand for constitutionalism with its emphasis on their own non-intervention. I he Russians do in fact intervene to the extentof giving discreet support to the Tudeh party, whose founder. Sulaiman Mirza. ranks as a communist, and of distributing newsprint to its newspaper and to other papers also. 1 he protection of the Tudeh party has in one case run contrary to the principle of non-intervention : the Persian Government wish to bring to Tehran for trial three men whom they allege to be criminals, but who also happen to have taken part in labour tioubles at a factory at Shahi, in the Soviet zone, and the Soviet authori ties refuse to permit this. The Tudeh party is not very revolutionary in its pul),ished statements, and it is often alleged that the Soviet authorities support it as a blind to cover more serious activities conducted underground. The Soviet authorities might, however, well consider the strict application of constitutional government in Persia, with its guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press, as the best way of producing anarchy, as the preliminary to the setting up of a Soviet form of organisation. In advocating strict adhesion to the constitution, the Soviet Embassy must really have their tongue hard in the cheek': complete freedom is all very well for countries other than Soviet Russia, until such men appear as can get into power by means of this freedom and then create the necessary dictatorship. There is no reason for us to think, from our contact with Russians here, that they have any illusions about Persian statesmen or officials or journalists, or suppose that a democratic regime can work in this country, and if they support democracy for Persia it is reasonable to think that the aim is not altogether disinterested. Nevertheless, if, as is probable, they are working hard in order to place in the next Majlis a considerable number of men professing extremist opinions, they are assisted, if not fully justified, bv the crass selfishness of the small possessing and ruling class in Persia and the vital need for an improvement in the conditions of the poorer classes. 14. If the Soviet authorities in Persia are trying to curry favour with the Persians, to make use of the press and to influence the elections,'it is possible that this is in part defensive and a result of suspicion of British intentions. Some ground of suspicion has been given from time to time by light-hearted attempts by British officers and groups to enter, or to obtain permission to enter, the Soviet zone, in order to carry out reconnaissances whose purpose was undefined and whose utility to the Soviet Government was not evident to the Soviet authorities on the spot. His Majesty’s Legation have recommended from the beginning the use of frankness with the Soviet authorities and the avoidance of anv action which might suggest that we were unduly inquisitive about their zone, or that we wished to acquue a favoured position in this country. It is sometimes sim^ested by people who see at close quarters the misery which has resulted from the weakening of control since the abdication of Reza Shah, that we ought to have taken over the administration. I hese critics have perhaps not reflected that the adoption of this policy, apart from the absorption of a huge body of skilled British officials and the destruction of any hope of getting co-operation from the -Persian authorities, would either have been opposed strenuously by the Soviet Government or would have been imitated in the Soviet zone with consequences which could Hardly be favourable to our long-term policy in this country. The Soviet authori- ttes may have found cause tor suspicion in the efforts wc have made to assist the Persians, in order to keep the administration running for the sake of aid to [ 42 ~7] ^ B 3'O 6 Russia, and to alleviate the hardships of war out of humanity and out of loyalty to the obligations incurred under the Tripartite Treaty. We have earned the hostility of landlords and of many Persian officials by trying to assist the Persian Government to collect the wheat surplus : the Russians have done nothing of the kind in their area and have thus avoided friction with officials and landowners, while making a merit of not interfering in the internal affairs of Persia. The British and American members of the Road Transport Board have laboured incessantly to rationalise and assist the civilian road transport of Persia, but the Russian member never attends, so that the Russians get the benefit of the labours of the board without sharing in the criticism which is directed against it by the ignoiant and the corrupt. It is natural that the relief work done by.the Anglo- Persian Relief Society, whose funds are provided largely by His Majesty’s Government, and the provision by the British military authorities of a 1,000-bed hospital foi‘ civilian typnus cases, should have compelled the Red Army to offer vaccination, ambulances and disinfecting squads to combat epidemics among the civilian population. It is no less natural that the Soviet Government, in view of the propaganda which we have been obliged tp do, to convince the Persian public that the British and Americans were doing their best to implement the under taking to supply Persia with 25,000 tons of wheat, should wish to make some contribution to the Persian food problem; but to spring this offer on us without notice is an act bordering on bad faith. 15. I he Americans are perhaps no less an object of suspicion than the British to the Soviet Government and their representatives in Persia. The Soviet Government have so far refused to give their formal assent to the replace ment of the British operational staff on the Persian railways by Americans, though the change is obviously to the benefit of the Russians, since the Americans can provide a far larger staff and thus intensify the rate of the despatch of aid to Russia. 'There is, however, theoretical justification for, the Russians’ refusal, in that the proposed change does not seem to have been notified to the Soviet Goveinment au the time either by the British or the United States Government; but the hostility to the x\merican advisers which the Soviet authorities arc undoubtedly showing is more difficult to justify. The Russians have even forced out of Tabriz an American who had been sent there by the Ministry of Supply to try to collect wheat, not only to feed Tabriz and Tehran, but also to fulfil the Persian Government’s contract to supply 5,000 tons of wheat to the Soviet authorities, and they refuse to allow him to go back. From the British point of view the Americans are, perhaps, the sole hope of Persia, British and Russian advisers are ruled out for political reasons; advisers from the smaller countries ot hurope would not have the prestige to enforce attention to their advice. It is oui that the Americans may be able to collect around them a nucleus of to erably good Persian officials and to ensure that all officials should receive salaries above the level where bribery and embezzlement are almost inevitable 1 he Soviet opposition, which is none the less strong because it is usually denied m public, is based on the argument which is in striking contrast to the cynical comments which are made on the Persian Government and administration in private by the Soviet Ambassador and other Soviet officials, that the Persians are quite capable of managing their own affairs. Some critics also argue that it is a mistake for the Persians to hand over their affairs to foreigners after being free for twenty years, and there is evidence, which I accept as good that they have even suggested that the Soviet Union is the place where the belt officials are to be found. .It seems probable that the prospect which we regard with hope if not with optimism, the Russians regard with ill will, viz., that the American advisers may succeed in establishing an administration which will gradually make Persia more prosperous and contented and better able to maintain its independence. 16. There is no doubt that whereas at the time of the occupation the Russians were regarded as barbarians capable of any atrocity and we were looked upon wuth comparative favour, the position is now reversed in the popular mind and if the richer classes have not changed their opinion, they dare not sav so openly. In only one respect, perhaps, is the new Soviet reputation in Persia deserved : the behaviour of their troops. They work their men nearly all the time let them out little give them no money to get drunk on, and shoot them for small offences, it has also been stated bv a Soviet officer, in conversation with a British consular official, that the Soviet authorities provide the men with regimental piostitutes disguised vaguely as A.I.S. Among our own troops there is bound to be some drunkenness, especially when vodka is easier to get than beer, and there have been violent articles in the press on this subject which cannot be dismissed as baseless. It is unfortunate that the British soldier who possesses7 so many good qualities that the Persian lacks—honesty, good-humour, helpful ness, consideration for anyone in distress—is unable to come into contact with the Persian on that level, hut appears at best as a remote being with whom the Persian cannot communicate at all, and at worst as a drunken man and there fore contemptible, for although the Persian will fuddle himself at home with opium, he rarely takes too much to drink in public. At the present moment there 'C^is high feeling in Tehran because a few days ago five Persians, engaged in stealing our military telegraph wire, were shot and killed by Indian troops. A violent newspaper campaign on the subject had only been checked by the suppression of a number of newspapers in deference to the protests of His Majesty’s Legation. Theft is thought little of among Persians, and even the Persian Government are so light-minded as not to realise the heinousness of interrupting military communications; but what has added to the virulence of the criticism is the fact that the shooting was carried out by Indians, who are i described as black, as slaves of the British, and so on. The Persian regards the i Indian with a contempt which is quite unjustified, and there is reason to believe I that our invasion of Persia in 1941 would have been much less unpopular had we not “ humiliated ” the Persians by using Indian troops to defeat them. The Soviet Government have used to invade and to occupy Northern Persia not only Russian troops but troops from States such as Armenia and Uzbekistan which are, in fact, much more “ slave ” to Moscow than India is to us, but this is never made a ground of criticism. 17. The Persians of the richer classes often express the fear that the Russians will refuse to leave Persia after the war. This fear seems to me ill- founded. Ihe Russians are not likely to be so clumsy as to bring upon themselves the accusation of imperialism by tailing to execute the provision of the Tripartite Treaty which requires the Russian and British Forces to evacuate Persian territory within six months of the conclusion of hostilities. Should they wish to return later on, and feel strong enough to defy world opinion, it would be as easy to obtain a spontaneous request from Azerbaijan for their return as it was to secure a pro-Soviet plebiscite in Estonia in 1939. It can be taken for granted that the Russians will assert themselves more in Persia than thev were content to do between 1924 and 1939; they will have established, their position as one of the three greatest Powers, and above all, they will have seen by close acquaintance what a favourable ground for their activities the Persian' people afford. Lenin laid down three conditions as necessary for a successful revolution : (1) a state of general corruption and decay above, (2) a conviction among the masses that a change would profit them, (3) the existence of a strong partv among the masses capable of directing the revolution. The first two conditions are already found here : nothing could be more corrupt, more completely lacking in public spirit and statesmanship, than the Persian upper class; while the feeling must be growing—exacerbated it is true by war conditions which might be less acute after the war—that any change must be for the better. The temptation to Russia to fulfil the third condition, by providing the strong party to direct the revolution, would be very great, especially as the miserable state of the country would afford full moral justification for the annihilation of the system which was responsible for it. 1 he prize would be attractive : not only the command of Persia, with its oil and its warm water ports, but access to an India offering under some sort of self-government greater opportunities for penetration than at present. It would not be as easy to “ inspire ” the administration in Persia as the Soviet! authorities seem to have done in Sinkiang for some years, Tehran being more in the public eye than Kashgar; but a party nucleus might be found among the many thousands of people who left Russia as refugees within the last ten years or so. It is true that the Persian does not seem inclined by nature to communism, and that the immense inertia which has enabled him to emerge successfully from under so many conquests might be expected to make him recalcitrant to violent changes; but the combination of intense poverty and hardship with the offer of an attractive remedy should be very strong. Moreover, just as the German economic and financial system fitted in very well with that of Persia, so the Soviet system of administration and its determined leadership provide the elements which Persia so conspicuously lacks. Finally, the Persian understands Soviet methods he is himself a liar and would fall in happily with the humbug of the Soviet 1 regime; he is a coward, and respects force. It is a misfortune which has to be I recognised, that Western liberal ideas mean little to a country like Persia, where those who held them have sooner or later to abandon them for lack of encourage ment. Libei t} and Deputies and a free press have landed Persia in a mess without creating that state of mind in which the individual can profit by whatwe have to teach. Unless the American advisers stay here for some years and are given all the opportunities required to make their influence felt, it is difficult to see how a generation of Persians is to arise who can manage some form of government that will not degenerate either into anarchy or into an authoritarian regime. At the present moment the outlook for the Persian who is honest and who believes in gradual reform (and there are such men), is dark. On the other hand, Soviet propaganda can offer a speedy solution. In India we hope that the^ problem of the Hindu widow will be solved by the gradual extension of liberal 1 and humane ideas; a Soviet commissar would appoint one of the less merry widows to the local Soviet, and leave it to her to ensure the escape of other widows from domestic slavery as well as the observation of the child marriage law. the abolition of temple prostitution, and other reforms which at present seem so far away. 18. It would seem that we shall have a difficult time in Persia after the war. The resentment which the Persian feels against us dates back to 1907, when we abandoned the role which he had supposed to be permanent, viz., that of fighting the Russians to protect not only Turkey but Persia also, and endeavoured to limit Russian designs on Persia to the northern provinces not by arms but by agreement. This resentment was increased by the 1919 Agreement, which the Persians, after initial acquiescence, eventually decided to regard as an attempt to establish some form of protectorate over their country. To satisfy their resentment, and to evade responsibility for the consequences of their owm cowardice, the Persians then invented the theory that we placed Reza Shah on the throne and, what is more absurd, kept him there for our own ends. They now have at least some shadow of justification for their resentment, in that we and the Russians invaded their country when, as they consider, they had given us no cause; and since it is dangerous to show any feeling against the Russians, they vent their spite on us. This is likely to manifest itself strongly after the war, in violent newspaper attacks against which we shall have no protection, in the persecution of any Persian subjects who may be held to have helped us during the war, and in revenge on the. A.I.O.C. for being British, for having helped in the war effort and for having escaped from the corrupt control of Persian officialdom for several years. The attitude that Russia will take up officially will depend to a large extent on the need she has of British and American help in the restoration of her devastated provinces. If we can judge by the past she will try to induce or compel her people to submit to great hardship rather than be indebted to the capitalist wx&gt;rld, and even the help she does accept may not bind Soviet policy very tightly to ours in regard to Persia. Russia will be able to count on twx&gt; factors of importance—the waning of public interest in any place so remote as Persia, and the existence among the British public of a pro-Russian feeling so strong and so blind that any British Government will have to take it into account. In any case, to encourage Persian hostility to our interests in secret, while preserving outwardly a correct attitude, would be very easy for the Soviet Government, given the venality and the cowardice of most Persians. At the back of the Persian mind there used to be, and often still is, the feeling that in the end the British will have to support him against Russia. At the best he will continue to hold this belief, which will encourage him to act as irresponsibly towards us as he is doing at the present moment; at the worst, he may conclude that we are never going to quarrel seriously with Russia about him and try to conciliate the Russians as the more dangerous. In this he may be wise on a short view, since it is, in fact, not conceivable that we should ever fight Russia for the'sake of Persia, though British people are still to be found who talk seriously of our keeping troops in the south of Persia as a barrier against Russian penetration. If Persia is to be defended against Russian domination, it can only be done as part of a wide system of co-operation, the foundations of which, we hope, have been laid by the twenty- year pact. Tussles of the type which prevailed between the 1907 Agreement and the outbreak of war in 1914 must be ruled out. It is a question whether we can count upon Persia to do much to maintain her own independence. Throughout the long period of despotic rule, which lasted until 1906, it is difficult to recall a ruler who was benevolent as well as capable, unless we go back to Shah Abbass, and that means going back to the time of Queen Elizabeth. On the other hand, Persia’s brief period of parlimentary government has not encouraged optimism in her friends. It is true that representative government has hardly had a fair chance on Persia; from 1906 to 1914 it was menaced by Russian encroachment in the northern provinces; from 1914 to 1924 it was embarrassed by the war and the confusion which followed; from September 1941, when Reza Shah abdicated,9 vpi 1K»S«- , ko*^* *(rU/' N it has been hampered by the lon^ disuse of the powers of self-government and by the steep rise in prices and other hardships which have accompanied, if they have not resulted from, the foreign occupation. Whatever the cause of the present conditions, however, it would be foolish to suppose that the prospects for the continued existence of a parliamentary regime in Persia are bright. The form of government adopted by Reza Shah was probably well-suited to Persia—a ^Cabinet and a Parliament as a constitutional facade, but a strong hand in the background directing both; only he nullified the good he did by stupidity and greed. At present there is no benevolent and capable dictator in sight, and even if there were and the people were prepared to accept him, it is probable that his advent to power would be discouraged by the Soviet Government—at least during the occupation. Much depends on the degree of success with which the American |financial adviser wields the special powers which the Majlis, after dangerous | delay, seem likely to confer on him. If that fails there may be such confusion i^xj^nd poverty in Persia that the temptation to take the easy road and to fall in ^Hiivith Soviet ways will be great. The Persian loves his independence, but an independence which seemed to offer nothing but a broadening down from embezzlement to embezzlement might in the long run cease to be attractive. For our part, we must try to discover rulers less venal and conservative than most of those who at present attain to high office, and to induce them to adopt a policy of reform suitable to the human material to which it is to be applied. Our main obstacle will be that Soviet sympathisers can offer a more glittering prize and play upon the baser Persian qualities. Meanwhile, the Russians are acquiring, in comparison with ourselves, a popularity which, albeit undeserved, must be taken into account as a very serious factor—'the more serious in that the circum stances which have created this popularity at our expense will make it difficult to redress the balance. It is tragic to learn from General Hurley, the personal representative of President Roosevelt in the Middle East, that among those who ^ are busy to praise the Russians and to criticise the British are senior members of | the American forces in Persia. 19. This despatch has dealt with the disease. The malady is deep-seated, because it resides in the nature of the Persian on one side and of the Soviet people and regime on the other; and it is aggravated by the looming proximity of Russia to this country. It must not be assumed, however, that there is no possible remedy, or at least no means of alleviation. There is Persian inertia, which will begin to exercise its full passive force when once the Soviet troops have left the country. This will affect more or less even Persians born in Russia and now “refugees ” in Persia, whom the Russians might wish to use as leaders of the revolution. Fear of Russia is very strong in the Persian, but when the Soviet troops have gone there will at least be talk, if not critical articles, about Soviet commercial methods during the war, the iniquitous munitions factories agreement, and the humbug of the Soviet offer of wheat. If Persian independence is’ seriously menaced, the Persians will turn in the first place to Great Britain for sympathy and assistance, though, as I have said, the remedy would have to be sought not in a local tussle but within the wider framework of world security. In the south of Persia, where the British have been known for generations, we still enjoy much respect and goodwill, and although a tendency has been found as far south as Shiraz to blame us for the present miseries on the ground that are all-powerful and could prevent them if we wished, this feeling may we diminish if the crisis abates, and it already has as a counter-weight the general recognition of the relief work which is being done in the south, mainly through His Majesty’s consular officers, in the name of the Anglo-Persian Relief Society. The various forms of annoyance which the British are accused of afflicting on the Persians—the oil shortage, the lack of transport, the high prices—will cease or be mitigated, and if they are not forgotten they may perhaps come to be regarded as attributable to the Russians as much as to us. The best kind of British propaganda will survive the war—that of the British Council. There is an immense demand for a knowledge of English as the coming world language and as the key to a literature which the Persian is able to appreciate, and this should ; enable us to reach the younger generation, where, if anywhere/tn Persia, ^ome sparks of character and honesty will be found.

FbMrafcc r lorries and the activities of the Allied Road Transport Board. '/ 2. Prices have continued to soar, and to enable Dr. Millspaugh, the newly- t ? arrived American Administrator-General of Persian Finances, to deal with the increasingly dangerous situation, a Bill has been submitted to the Majlis by the u fA* Government. It is expected, however, to meet with bitter opposition from vested ' frU interests. The increase in economic distress, which in this country is always ^ a ascribed to Bidtish inefficiency or machinations, has naturally had a deplorable effect on our popularity here, and public opinion has been strongly influenced bv the fulminations of the press at our expense. M. Soheily, who succeeded Qawam- es-Sultaneh as Prime Minister in February last, has failed to deal firmly with the press, preferring the policy of persuasion, which has met with little or no success. On the other hand, there are indications that he intends to introduce a measure of social reform and to take action, by means of the special powers proposed for Dr. Millspaugh. to check the rise in the cost of living. Food Situation. 3. I he cereals situation has been dominated by a chronic shortage of supplies in I ehran itself, lasting well into March. Azerbaijan delivered scarcely any wheat to 1 ehran. and Khorassan much less than was expected, and thus made the Food Administration almost entirely dependent on imported supplies long betoie the ai rival of the first wheat to be shipped from North America under the Food Agreement, and by the time the first of this wheat reached Tehran some 5,000 tons of wheat had had to be advanced to the Persian Government from the Persian Gulf pool. Unprecedented cold weather and more than one crash or mishap on the railway, interrupting the movement of wheat from the South for days at a time, together with the blocking of the roads bv snow, which interfered with deliveries of barley from Iraq, combined to keep'Tehran on the brink of starvation Some 1.200 tons of wheat and barley were released by the Russians from the Gurgan area, south-east of the Caspian, but the truth of a statement made by the Russians m London in February, to the effect that Tehran was being provided with foodstuffs entirely from the Northern Provinces of Persia was anything but apparent m Tehran. On the contrary, the Persians themselves realised how dependent on imported supplies thev had become, and proceeded to accuse the Allies in the press of starving them by delaying, or even holding hack altogether, the promised 25.000 tons of imported wheat. These attacks we had to ( oun ei m public statements, showing that we had more than fulfilled our obligations by supplying grain in advance of actual shipments under the Food ' g reei ^ ent ’ pointing out that the Persians, too, had obligations, namely to assist their Government in collecting grain inside the country 4. This, for the most part, they failed to do. In the provinces our consular liaison officers armed at last by Mr. Sheridan, after .repeated representations on our part, with a somewhat piecemeal authority for dealing with hoarders ' for revising, where necessary, the amount of landlords’ undertakings to deliver c^rain to the Government and for hiring animal transport, continued to fight the unequal battle against hoarding landlords and dishonest bakers, and each provincial area temporary Ihorteges' 1 ^ ° W ' P , ' ecarlous “istenc-e. not without occasional i ft -1' fi 11 ® 8 ^ 011 °i the eventual requirements of imported grain for thp deficit areas of the South, to enable them to carry on till the next harvest, was the [41—44] . ^ 7.J 7subject of discussions in January and February between Mr. Sheridan and the British and United States Legations. The discussions also covered the calcula tion of the amount of imported grain required for Tehran itself. The final conclusion was that, in addition to, the 25.000 tons of wheat already promised, 5,000 tons of wheat and some 16.000 ton§ of barley or millet flour would need to l)e imported, and these additional amounts and more have now been incorporated in the M.E.S.C. programme for the provision of cereals for the Persian Gulf area. It is hoped to supply barley or millet from Iraq : shipments have already been made direct to southern ports and deliveries to Tehran by road, via Khanaqin, have also begun. 6. Engrossed almost daily with the problem of finding the flour for the next day s bread, and with the fui'ther preoccupation of bringing into operation a central bakery for Tehran in the teeth of the bakers’ opposition. Mr. Sheridan has had little or no time to give to the problem of securing a better deal both foi his own Go\eminent and the Allies next year by securing the maximum possible collections from the expected bumper grain crop this summer. It will be one of our tasks in the coming months to see that he is better equipped than he was last yeai with the two main weapons of money and transport, without which the present (government monopoly of the sale and purchase of wheat can onlv pio\e once more, in the absence of the means of compulsion, a useless and expensive folly. T ransport. 7. I he organisation of the Persian Government Road Transport Depart ment under the control of the Allied Road Transport Board and the provision dining the last tew months of over 150 Lease/Lend lorries should have brought some iclief to the difficult civil transport situation. This has not been as effective as might have been expected, owing to the failure of the general public in this country, and the lorry owners in particular, to help to make the new organisation a i Llke ever y other measure passed for the good of the whole community, which hinders the enrichment of a particular section of the population, the control qt tiansport has met with bitter opposition, even from more responsible quarters m the Majlis and the Administration. As a consequence, the fleet of contracted vehicles formed by the Road Transport Department has partly been lost; and many vehicles that might be doing useful work are either working for their own account or lying idle in garages. It has, therefore, been impossible to fulfil the transport programme for cereals (barley and millet) from the Iraqi frontier to lehran and many difficulties have hindered the work of collecting cereals in the Tabnz district Without the Lend/Lease vehicles the situation would have been very serious indeed. 1 he Road Transport Department have also been starved of tunds by the Government, and as a consequence have often been unable to pav their contractors. In spite of these difficulties, great progress has been made in intro ducing some order into civil road transport, and ^clearlv strong support must continue to be given by the British and American Legations to the Road transport Board and the Road transport Department, which can be said to be the only barrier between organisation and chaos where civil road transport is conceined he Russian Delegate attended only one meeting of the Board probably because the Russians want to remain free from its regulations 8. The situation has not been helped by the failure of the railway to brino- its quota of civil supplies to Tehran. Owing to an increase in supplies to Russia and to interruptions of the service caused by breakdowns and accidents oil supplies in particular, have been reduced. Many factories in Tehran and s ahan had to reduce their activity, some to shut down temporarily, and much hardship was caused to the civil population by lack of kerosene. While the oil position has now improved, supplies are still insufficient to meet all requirements C o supphes from Ahwaz, however,, are coming up the line satisfactorily. in v R C A 0tr °- ° f the .^ration of the Trans-Iranian Railway om the British to the American military authorities was completed on the s P ri l ai jd the Lnited States (Government are preparing to regularise the posi ion of their troops in Persia by the conclusion of a triaty similar to he Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of 1942. ' tbe Financial Position. 10. Since the hist review of the financial position in Persia little has been done to combat inflation. 1 he various remedies recommended by the Anti Inflation Committee in Cairo have been placed before the Persian' Governmentauthorities on numerous occasions, but little, if anything, has been achieved. With the arrival of Dr. A. G. Millspaugh, the American Financial Adviser, the situation began to be handled with more vigour, and the Majlis are now debating a Bill (as will be shown in detail in a subsequent paragraph of this despatch) to invest him with comparatively wide powers to control prices, reorganise the system of taxation, &amp;c., which, if rigidly enforced, should go a long way towards placing the country on a more stable economic footing. 11. In order to absorb to some degree a portion of the existing surplus purchasing power, a scheme was suggested by the Financial Counsellor to His Majesty’s Legation, whereby His Majesty’s Government would exchange the equivalent in gold bullion for a quantity of gold coins at present held by the National Bank of Iran as part cover for the note-issue, and sell the coins in the open market, with a reserve price of £12 an ounce. This sale of gold, which has been sanctioned by all parties concerned, should have a beneficial effect on prices, in so far as it is hoarded. It had been suggested from other quarters that the scheme might be extended to other Middle East countries, but in view of the probability that the sale of gold within the Sterling Area might promote a variety of undesirable contingencies which Elis Majesty’s Government would not be prepared to meet, the experiment is to be tried only in Persia, and here to a limited extent, t he proposal is to put on the market gold to the equivalent of 100.000 gold sovereigns; should the experiment prove successful, a further 200.000 gold sovereigns may be forthcoming. 12. It was suggested by Dr. Millspaugh early in the year that gold should be used instead of sterling to finance the war expenditure of His Majesty’s Govern ment in Persia. He contended that the sale of gold would relieve pressure for future increases in the note-issue, and thus prevent a further decline in the purchasing power of the rial; and that the high bazaar price of gold would actually relieve the sterling expenditure of His Majesty’s Government. It was held by His Majesty’s Government, however, that. ‘ broadly speaking, war expenditure in Persia could only be financed by the issue of rial currency, and this at the rate of exchange laid down by the Financial Agreement. Also, inter alia that the implications of this proposal in relation to our financial relations with neighbouring territories must be of obvious concern to His Majesty’s Government, whose stocks of gold are not unlimited. 13. The anomalous position whereby His Majesty’s Government was the only one of the three Allied Powers in Persia to have a Financial Agreement with the Persian Government has now been altered by the conclusion ^recently of a boviet-Persian Financial Agreement, and the proposal of the signature of a similar agreement between the Persian Government and the Government of the United States. The Soviet Agreement, as foreshadowed in paragraph 27 of my despatch No. 434 of the 21st December, 1942, is in less generousperms than our own, but the United States Government have agreed, in their draft to furnish Persia with dollars against all rials required by the United States, and to exchange these dollars for gold. Phis may lead to pressure on us to increase our undertaking to provide gold under Article IX of our agreement. Some mis givings were also created by the inclusion in the American draft agreement of a clause which accepted the principle of a variation in the rial/dollar rate of exchange; and these two factors were seized on by the Majlis Commission then discussing a Bill to ratify our Financial Agreements, as a pretext to defer the question ot ratification pending a pronouncement by Elis Majesty’s Government as to their intentions as to the convertibility of gold under our agreement and to the rate of exchange. Subsequently we were informed by the United States i reasury that the provision regarding the rate of exchange is common form in all l nited States stabilisation fund agreements, and that it was not the intention of the United States Government to varv the rate of exchange without nrior consultation with His Majesty’s Government. ° f 14. I he cm rent) situation continues to cause anxiety An order for the printing of notes to the value of 1,500 million rials is beino- carried out bv De la Rue in London. These notes are scheduled to be delivered to Tehran in varying consignments by the end of July 1943. At the present rate of \llied war expenditure this sum will have been practically exhausted bv that time and the note reserve will have reached the dangerously low level of about 200 million rials appreciably less than one month’s Allied requirements. A further order . of 2.400 million rials has accordingly been placed in London to meet the require ments for the period the 1st August, 1943, to the 31st March, 1944. ?&gt;.. eiffht months at 300 million rials a month. [41—44] B4 M. Soheily’s Government. 15. In my despatch No. 80 of the *25th February, I gave some account of the events which finally led to the reassumption of power by M. Soheily. The new Cabinet is probably as good a team as can be found in present circumstances, and the recent appointment of M. Tadayyon, previously Minister without Portfolio, to be Minister of Food Supply, has added to its strength. The Prime Minister has sought to reinforce his influence with the Majlis by the formation of a body of fourteen Deputies who will meet the Cabinet periodically and maintain contact between the Government and the Chamber. The Government have shown courage in asking the Majlis to grant very wide powers to Dr. Millspaugh for the control of prices, and have inevitably encountered opposition. The proposed powers would give Dr. Millspaugh control of everything concerning the purchase of merchandise, other than food-stuffs, including importation, transport, ware housing and distribution. He would wield all the powers conferred on the Government under the anti-hoarding law and other legislation for the control of internal and external trade. He would be empowered to require returns of existing stocks, to issue licences for the manufacture and sale of goods, to confiscate stocks with compensation to owners, and in general to do all that he considered necessary to stabilise prices and ensure fair distribution. Finally, he would have power to make regulations having the force of law. The measure is naturally being attacked by the hoarders and profiteers, and some sections of the press have condemned it as being inimical to Persian national independence. Food-stuffs have been excluded from the purview of the Bill as falling within Mr. Sheridan’s province, but legislation has been introduced to prevent the forward buying of crops by speculators. 16. A few days ago M. Soheily delivered a New Year broadcast, in which he exhorted his compatriots to make sacrifices in the interest of final victory, and to co-operate with him in realising, under war-time conditions, a greater measure of social justice. He outlined 'a ten-point programme, which included not only measures for the control of prices and the elimination of hoarding, but •also “the establishment of justice and equality in the distribution of wealth; improvement of conditions for Government employees, peasants and working classes by means of insurance and compensation schemes; the development of public health and medical facilities and effective primary education throughout the country.” It remains to be seen how far M. Soheily can be trusted to pursue these ideals. But his message is certainly a step towards the reforms of which Persia is so sorely in need. In this he has the full support of the Shah. The huge fortunes which have been amassed during the past year by the few, and the acute economic distress of the masses, which is now aggravated by a tvphus epidemic have undoubtedly produced a situation in which the existing regime feels itself threatened. On the one hand, the Tudeh party has greatly increased its activity, with the formation of new cells and the dissemination of Socialist propaganda on a wide scale. On the other hand, thete is a definite movement, although not strong at present, to bring back Seyyid Zia-ed-Din Tabatabai from Palestine A number of Deputies have recently travelled through Palestine, ostensibly for their health, but possibly with the intention of seeing Seyyid Zia. An active propaganda is being carried on, representing him as the only man who can save Persia, and his supporters maintain that the time will be ripe for his return this month if the Shah’s suspicions can be allayed. Court circles make no secret of their fear that Seyyid Zia might put an end to the Pahlevi dynasty or. at all events, greatly curtail the influence of the Crown. 17 in this situation the Government is not optimistic about the approaching general election, and the Prime Minister is considering whether he would not do well to postpone it until after the war. He is putting off a decision on the grounds that the Soviet Embassy might object to postponement. I he probability that elections will be held this year faces his Majesty’s Legation with a delicate problem It is natural to suppose that the Soviet authorities will use their influence in their zone to secure the election of candidates more or less subser vient to their views, and the question arises how we can counterbalance this by influencing the elections ourselves in other parts of Persia without giving cause for complaint to our Soviet Allies or cause for misunderstanding to the Americans With your approval I have instructed His Majesty s consular officers to watch the situation closely and to study ways of supporting and encouraging candidates 'from among the younger and more progressive elements who have some public . spirit and are ready to sponsor a real programme of reform as opposed to an extremist policy.Soviet Interests. 18. During the period under review the Russians have shown particular interest in that part of Persia outside their zone, as well as increasing suspicion of British and American policy. For instance, a scientific expedition, consisting of twelve persons and headed by Lieutenant-General Professor Pavlovsky, an expert on malaria, has toured South - F&gt;astern Persia accompanied by a British liaison officer. The Soviet military attache, evidently acting under instructions, has asked a number of questions about road and aerodrome construction by the British army and our troop movements in Eastern Persia. Anglo-Soviet relations here are none too easy at the best of times, but the situation has not been rendered easier by the attitude of the Soviet Embassy in refusing to issue passes for British military personnel to visit their zone, unless they are satisfied that their journey is directly concerned with the furtherance of aid to Russia. Further, they have resisted our proposal to station a liaison officer with the Soviet forces to reside in Tabriz, and have only agreed that we may send one officer &amp;nd^ a number of other ranks to Tabriz to deal with the work arising out of U.K.C.C. and British military convoys. Soviet-American relations in Persia are passing through a difficult phase.' Permission has been refused for the Americans to build standard accommodation for lorry drivers along the road to Tabriz and, in consequence, the Americans have refused to send the convoys and are dumping supplies at Qazvin. An American stationed at Tabriz as Mr Sheridan’s representative has been requested to return to Tehran to get his residence permit renewed, and it is understood that representations have been made at Washington regarding the alleged anti-Soviet attitude of the American Consul at Tabriz. Both these officials are now in Tehran and are unlikely to return to their posts. It is also clear that the Soviet authorities are suspicious and jealous of the presence of the American advisers. Recently the Soviet Ambassador asked the Prime Minister why Persia wanted to hand over her affairs to foreigners “after twenty years ”; and the Minister of War alleges that the ambassador asked him why, if foreign advisers were necessary, the Persian Government did not engage Soviet advisers, as the Soviet Union’was the best administered country in the world. It may not be fanciful to suppose that the Russians are fomenting opposition to the Millspaugh Bill not only because of their objection to the American influence, but also because, as I indicated in my despatch No. 80 of the 25th February, they may, for their own reasons, prefer the continuance of the existing disorder. The Press. 19. The press, non-existent at the beginning of the year as a result of the ban imposed after the 8th December, has been allowed to reappear subject to the approval of the editors and owners by a committee of control. The control has unfortunately been slack and inefficient and the capital has now been inundated with about forty newspapers. Frequently articles have appeared laying all the economic evils of Persia at the door of the Allies, and worded in several cases so as to impute most of the blame to His Majesty’s Government. In many cases I have been obliged to make the strongest representations to the 1 i une Minister against these unwarranted attacks and criticisms, but the latter, who has shown firmness and courage in launching his programmes of lefoim, has displayed deplorable weakness in dealing with the press. One of the ™p s f scurrilous papers has, however, been suppressed at my request. Another of which I complained has also been suppressed, though in this case it had also offended the Shah by suggesting that the troubles of the 8th December were instigated by the Court. M. Soheily has undertaken to suppress any other which may in future attack the Allies, and to issue no more licences. He has also had an editor arrested for a personal attack on His Majesty’s Minister. 20. Unfortunately the anti-British tone of the press reflects only too faith fully the trend which public opinion has taken during the trials and privations of the past winter. In my telegram No. 232 of the 1st March I drew attention to the dangerous situation which has arisen, in which we are compared unfavour ably with the Russians because, owing to natural causes and our desire to send all possible help to Russia, conditions in the Russian zone are generally better than they are elsewhere in Persia. , , . 21 In this situation our task during the next few months must be to increase our contribution to the welfare of the Persian people to the greatest extent consistent with the provision of necessary supplies to Russia. the principal element in the promotion of their welfare can only be internal ^iorm and reorganisation of the trade in, and distribution of, essential goods In this sphere we must clearly give all possible support and encouragement to the Government’s programme, more especially in regard to the Millspaugh Bill.22. For the rest, much has already been done in providing supplies of grain and reorganising transport, and we are considering measures for increasing supplies of consumers’ goods, particularly from India, and the allocation of additional tonnage for civil supplies on the Trans-Iranian Railway. Special attention must be paid to the question of oil, the shortage of which has lately done us immense harm and provided a fertile theme for pro-Axis propagandists. We must likewise be ready to give the Ministry of Food all possible help in the collection of the harvest/ Our relief work in Persia must be continued and developed, and I am trying to work out a scheme for the establishment of dispensaries in Tehran, possibly with the assistance of medical personnel from Paiforce and India. All these activities must be thoroughly publicised, and it is obvious that the present situation calls for the most intense effort on the part of all concerned. At the moment of writing the British military authorities have provided the best kind of propaganda by offering a 1,000-bed Indian hospital, complete with doctors, nurses and orderlies, for civilian typhus patients. But for this offer, another, and in that case legitimate grievance, would have been created in that we had had to refuse to return to the Persian Government, to be used for typhus cases, two large buildings which are being used as hospitals*, one by the British and one by the Poles. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India to His Majesty’s Minister of State at Cairo, and to Minbranch at Bagdad, to Paiforce, Bagdad, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Kuibyshev.

Bullard to Mr. Eden .— / T ot 943 ceivea March Copy No. 114 •) Tehran, February 25, 1943. THE vote of confidence in the new Prime Minister, M. Soheily, and his Cabinet on the 21st February affords a convenient opportunity for reviewing the main outlines of the recent Cabinet crisis which has formed the subject of a series of recent telegrams ending with my teleg ram No. 198 of the 21st February last. I summarise below the principal political events which have happened since Qawam es Sultaneh’s position began to become difficult, in the middle of January last. 2. Since the disorders of the 8th December, 1942, it became increasingly evident that relations between the Shah and Qawam es Sultaneh were going from bad to worse. The Shah appeared determined to direct and control the army, and to interpret literally the constitutional principle that he was the Commander-in-Chief of his forces. The Prime Minister, on the other hand, was determined to assert and establish the principle of ministerial responsibility for all Ministries, especially the Ministry of War, and he had not long previously announced his intention to ask for full powers from the Majlis, enabling him to assume personal responsibility for the current business of the country. That proposal, however, provoked strong opposition not only from thc-Majlis but from the Court and it was not followed up. It was clear that such political manoeuvring for power caused great inefficiency and a general slowing down of the administra tive machine. Throughout this time my Soviet and American colleagues and I supported the Prime Minister, and I endeavoured to effect a reconciliation between Qawam es Sultaneh and the Court. 3. I had reason to hope on the 19th January that a reconciliation had indeed taken place and that the Prime Minister would introduce new blood into his Cabinet at the instigation of the Shah. Two days later he introduced to the Majlis the following new Ministers : Jawad Ameri at the Ministry of Justice (instead of the Interior); Farajullah Bahramy at the Ministry of the Interior; Muhsin Rais at the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs; Ali Mutamedi at the Ministry of Communications; and Nasrullah Intizam at the Ministry of Health. He also announced that Allahyar Saleh would become Minister of Finance on his return to Persia from the E T nited States. At the same time the Prime Minister tabled a Bill establishing a Ministry of Labour and National Economy, to which Dr. Musharraf Naficy was to be appointed. The Majlis did not receive this announcement with enthusiasm and Qawam was well advised not to put the new Cabinet to the vote. The Majlis Deputies showed surprising opposition to Dr. Naficy and the new Ministry of Labour and National Economy never came into existence. Of the new Ministers three (Rais, Mutamedi and Intizam) were regarded as the Shah’s men, and were in consequence looked on with some suspicion by many of the Majlis Deputies. The remaining members of the Cabinet continued in their posts. 4. There followed an uneasy period of a few days during which the new Ministers (with the exception of Dr. Naficy) began to take over their duties, while the Majlis Deputies showed their usual obstructiveness—some being suspicious of the new men, others disappointed that none of the Deputies had been appointed to ministerial rank. The Prime Minister thereupon introduced a Bill designed to abrogate the law of the 22nd Tir, 1306, that no Deputy could be appointed a Minister without resigning and waiting for three months, but that attempt to buy over the Majlis merely succeeded in raising acute jealousy between rival Deputies who longed for ministerial rank, and the Bill was soon referred to a commission and shelved. The well-known politician Tadayyun expressed the opinion that the country was heading for chaos, and needed a strong hand to [40-38]assume real power, put the Majlis and the Shah in their proper places and tackle urgent problems such as the stabilisation of prices and the supply of bread, instead of struggling with political intrigues. 5. Meanwhile the new Minister of the Interior, Farajullah Bahramy, was the cause of a fresh crisis between the Prime Minister and the Shah. On the' 2nd February he had taken two of the new American advisers to an audience with the Shah. On coming out of the room, he found the Prime Minister waiting for him in a furious temper. Qawam es Sultaneh reproved him sharply for going direct to the Shah without informing his chief, and told the Minister that he should resign. Bahramy replied very impertinently, saying he would not resign : it was for the Prime Minister to resign. The Prime Minister then went to the Shah and offered to resign if Farajullah Bahramy did not, but the Shah refused to accept the resignation of either. The net result was to increase the coolness which had existed for so long between the Shah and the Qawam, and it was evident that the Court hoped that the Prime Minister would soon fall and be replaced by Sa’ed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. A further cause of friction arose out of a remark made to the Shah by the Minister-designate for Portugal (Javad Sineki) during his farewell audience : Sineki had suggested to the Shah that His Majesty should take a direct and personal interest in appointments made to foreign posts : this reached the ears of the Prime Minister, who. according to the Court, twisted the story round and made it appear that the Shah was once more endeavouring to interfere in the adminisration of the country. 6. Meanwhile the Majlis, on the 4th February, endeavoured by a snatch- vote to make the appointment of head of the National Bank dependent on the vote of the Majlis, the effect of which would be to remove from the post Abul Hassan Ebtehaj. who had only recently been selected for that position by the Qawam—an appointment which was regarded as extremely suitable by almost all responsible persons in Tehran. As Ebtehaj, although intensely nationalistic, is believed to be friendly to us, the action of the Majlis was to some extent an attack on us, as well as on the Prime Minister. The Shah spoke once more of dismissing the Majlis, provided that he could obtain a Prime Minister whom he could trust, and sounded me on the subject of the return of Taqi-Zadeh and of the appoint ment of Ali Mansour to the post of Prime Minister if Taqi-Zadeh could not come. My Soviet colleague and I endeavoured to settle the quarrel between Qawam and the Minister of the Interior, without success. 7. On the 7th February the Prime Minister succeeded in obtaining a vote of confidence of 65 votes to 42 from the Majlis. This somewhat surprising result was secured partly by the Prime Minister’s acceptance of the Bill concerning the head of the National Bank, and partly by political manipulation and promises of favours to the Majlis Deputies. Qawam was always inclined to regard success in political manoeuvre as more important than good administration : on the other hand, since he was opposed by the Shah and had little support from the people, it was natural that he should try to win over the Majlis. He made a long speech ’ in the Majlis on the 10th February which amounted to an emphatic assertion of the Prime Minister’s duty of administering the affairs of the country without interference by the Shah. He continued to press for the adoption of his Bill to enable Deputies to become Cabinet Ministers without a three months’ wait. To support his plea he quoted article 32 of the Annex to the Constitution, which reads : “ If a Deputy applies for a post in any Government organism, his parlia mentary functions thereby lapse, and he can only take part in the business of the Majlis if he resigns the post in question and is re-elected for some electoral constituency.” This article, argued the Prime Minster, had hitherto been held to include candidates for positions in the Cabinet, whereas he maintained that it meant only civil service posts. He stated in the course of his speech that the laws passed during the late despotic regime had not been in accordance with the spirit of democracy and that the next Legislature might do well to revise even the Constitution. His appeal had little effect on the Deputies, while the Shah professed to detect the most sinister designs in the reference to a revision of the Constitution. The Prime Minister went on with his attempts to complete his Cabinet, and hoped on the 11th February to persuade Soheily, Hikmat and Bader to join the Government. On the following day, however, they refused his proposal, and the weary Prime Minister attributed their refusal to Court intrigues. The Soviet Ambassador did his best to help the Qawam, and even sent a message to Tadayyun to the effect that the Soviet Government no longer had any objection to his joining the Government.3 8. On the 13th February, I understand, the Majlis Deputies selected one of their number named I’tibar to inform the Prime Minister that he no longer had any majority in the Majlis, and Qawam resigned. 9. As the result of a secret vote of the Majlis, it became evident that Soheily *Nivas the favourite candidate of the Deputies; he obtained 72 votes against 18 for Sa’ed. and a deputation waited on the Shah to inform him of that fact. The Shah informed them that he would have preferred Sa’ed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Prime Minister, and asked them to think it over, hut this had no effect. On the 15th February Soheily formed a Government and he introduced it to the Majlis two days later, the members being as follows :— His Excellency M. AH Soheily : Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. His Excellency M. Muhammad Sa’ed Maraghai : Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency M. Sayyid Muhammad Tadayyun : Minister of State. His Excellency M. Hussein Sami'i : Minister of State. His Excellency M. Amanullah Ardalan : Minister of Health. His Excellency M. Ali Asghar Hikmat: Minister of Justice. His Excellency M. Mahmud Bader : Minister of Commerce, Industry and Mines. His Excellency M. Andul Hussein Hajhir : Minister of Roads. His Excellency Marshal Amir Ahmadi : Minister for War. His Excellency M. Ali Akbar Siassi : Minister of Education. His Excellency M. Nasrullah Intizam : Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. His Excellency M. Allahyar Saleh : Minister of Finance. He obtained a vote of confidence by a large majority on the 21st February. 10. Qawam retired to his estates at Lahijan and has been subjected to a torrent of abuse and calumny ever since he left office. His principal assailants have been newspaper editors whose papers he suppressed after the disorders of the 8th December. Demands that he should be brought to trial are combined with hints that proof has been found that he himself was responsible for the December disorders. These critics are careful not to remind their readers that the army and the police made no serious effort to stop the disorders until they had continued for some hours, and none whatever to prevent the Prime Minister’s house from being looted. 11. It is difficult to imagine that the new Cabinet of Soheily can last longer than a few months, and it is disappointing to find that the Government of Qawam es Sultaneh, who showed himself to be a man of energy, authority and courage (the last quality especially was shown in his firm treatment of the disorders of December), should last not much longer than six months. It may be urged against him that he was old-fashioned, that he tried to do too much himself without reference to his Ministers, and that he made certain very unwise and unsuitable appointments. On the other hand, he was the first Prime Minister to come out definitely on the side of the Allies; he made some very good appoint ments of promising young men (for instance, A. H. Ebtehaj at the National Bank, Manuchehr Eghbal at the Ministry of Health, Dr. Siassi at the Ministry of Education and Hajhir at the Ministry of Industry). At the end, however, he lost his grip to some extent and failed to accomplish any successful political manipulations, and, having lost the support of both Majlis and Court, he had no choice but to resign. 12. The prolonged crisis which I have described appears to have no signi ficance as far as either internal or external policy are concerned, though the new Prime Minister has been shown to be a less forceful man than his predecessor and is unlikely to show much firmness in handling the Majlis or the press. In spite of all our representations, both Qawam and Soheily have failed disastrously in the past to force landlords and hoarders to disgorge their grain and to provide bread for the people, and, were it not for the pressure of the American advisers, the outlook would be as hopeless as it was this time last year. The fact is that since Reza Shah left the government of Persia has been in the hands of a relatively small clique of persons who carry on a class government in their own interest. Many people, including the Shah, fear that at some future time the present state of affairs, if it continues, may lead to some popular outburst, inwhich the whole regime may be swept away; and some people even suggest that the Soviets support the present regime for that reason. I doubt if we have to look for anything so Machiavellian at present; the fact is that the autocratic methods of Shah Reza discouraged the entry of capable and honest young men into administrative and political life, and it may be several years before new personalities are trained to fill the vacuum which Shah Reza created. 13. It is my hope that the appointment of American advisers may hasten this process. Meanwhile, it is encouraging that, whatever fears there may be as to the Shah’s alleged autocratic tendencies, and however blind his trust in men if they are only military officers, his suggestions for Cabinet appointments have hitherto been good ones. 14.

[y Sir, Tehran, December 21, 1942. v *\s'&gt;Js' w IN paragraph 27 of my despatch No. 314 of the 22nd September I ventured, when reviewing the events of the preceding weeks, to express a cautious optimism as to the outlook of the Allies in Persia. This forecast has been falsified by subequent events : these have included a financial crisis, a food crisis and a political and constitutional crisis—all of which have been fraught with difficulties for the Allies and particularly for His Majesty’s Government. The Financial Crisis. 2. The Anglo-Persian Financial Agreement of the 26th May, 1942, purports to ensure the automatic provision of rials for the needs of the British military authorities. Unfortunately, these needs could not be met without a considerable expansion of the note issue, and the power to control the note issue rested with the Majlis—a collection of persons entirely unfitted by character and training for so delicate a task. The dissolution of the Majlis, which was at first contem plated by the Qawam, would have solved this difficulty, but the Prime Minister was driven back in a course less satisfactory both to him and to the Allies, viz., to attempt to secure legal authority for an increase in the note issue large enough to cover for many months to come both the needs of the Allies and the requirements of the Persian Government. The introduction of a Bill providing for an increase of 2,000 million rials led, however, to such an outcry in the press and the Majlis about the inevitable rise in prices which must result (obliging merchants and retailers raised the prices at once to illustrate the economic law invoked) that the Government decided not to proceed with the Bill: all they could do was to push through a Bill for 500 million rials without mention of the needs of the Allies. At this moment British needs were at least as great as they had ever been; American requirements in rials were increasing rapidly and the Russians also were making demands. 3. The Prime Minister having failed in an attempt to secure from the Majlis special powers which would have enabled him to issue currency notes as required, it was evident that a major effort would have to be made to settle this question once for all. Hitherto His Majesty’s Government had had to struggle with the issue unaided : the Russians had secured their rials by various doubtful devices, which had hitherto sufficed for their small needs; the Americans had been able to exchange dollars so long as there were rials, obtained by British efforts, to be bought. Had the United States and Soviet Governments had financial agreements similar to ours, there would have been no trouble : faced by a united demand for rials from all three of the Allies, the Majlis would have given in. The Prime Minister pointed this out to the American Minister on the only occasion when the latter gave serious help to His Majesty’s Minister. His Majesty’s Minister warned the Soviet Ambassador frequently about the risk to which aid to Russia was exposed by the attitude of the Majlis on the currency question and by the obvious lack of a united Allied front, and Mr. Eden made very strong representations to M. Maisky as to the need for Soviet co-operation with His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran. At the last moment, when the military till was empty and arrangements had been made that in the last resort the Banque Mellie should be occupied by British troops and new note forms in stock seized, the Soviet Ambassador decided to help. At his suggestion he and His Majesty’s Minister visited the President of the Majlis and recited a long catalogue of the occasions on which the Majlis had blocked or delayed measures essential to the Allied war effort and asked him to let the Deputies know that the Allies had drawn their own conclusions from these acts. Hearing of this message, knowing perhaps that some military preparations were afoot, and realising from the Allied victories on all fronts that the hope, or the fear, that the Germans would come to Persia was baseless, the Deputies rushed to declare their affection ; M iS i n.o 7* Pa. (' 1 . 0 . ■ ■ - ! T-.- ■ i'l o 15; 9432 for the Allied cause, and at a midnight session the power to control the note issue was transferred from the Majlis to a statutory Persian commission on which the American financial adviser is to serve when he arrives. This arrangement is satisfactory, and there has been no trouble in obtaining rials since. Two small financial concessions were made by His Majesty’s Government in return : settlements will be made every three instead of every six months, and the percentage of the sterling balance which wilj be turned into gold has been raisecj^ from 40 per cent, to 60 per cent. His Majesty's Government had also, howevei to promise to help to make up on certain conditions any real deficit in wheat and transport. The Prime Minister’s Position. 4. The Qawam’s courage and firmness, though remarkable in a Persian, were not equal to the difficult situation which began to develop the moment he came into power. He would have liked to get rid of the Majlis from the beginning, but the Soviet Government were against this step, and some members of his Cabinet were not entirely with him, preferring to keep the Majlis as a screen between the Government and the Allies. The Prime Minister came into active conflict with the Majlis almost at once by what the Deputies considered his oft'-hand treatment of them over the Conscription Bill and, although the dispute was patched up, an impression remained that the Qawam was inclined to be dictatorial. He incurred strong criticism—much of it justified—for some of the appointments he made, and he was the object of attack from both press and Deputies on the score of high prices, food shortage and shortage of transport and of consumer’s goods—subjects on which the Allies also came in for violent attacks. To meet these attacks, the Prime Minister tried, on the one hand, to secure concessions from the Allies as a condition of the issue of more rial notes, and, , on the other, to devise a means whereby the power of the Majlis to delay and block public business might be limited. The financial concessions granted by His Majesty’s Government have been mentioned. In addition the Prime Minister also demanded that Great Britain and/or the United States should supply Persia with 25,000 tons of wheat. The reasonable resistance of His Majesty’s Govern ment to this demand, which was formulated in particular by the Minister of State when he was here, was undermined by the discovery that the Russians proposed to feed their troops in Persia from local grain to a much greater extent than hitherto, and in the end an agreement was concluded which will be dealt with in a later paragraph. 5. The Prime Minister’s attempt to limit the powers of the Majlis was a failure : he wanted full powers on certain subjects until about next August, but the Deputies, fearing that this would enable the Qawam to control the next general election, greeted the proposal with a howl of fury. Taken aback by the uproar, the Prime Minister first whittled his proposal down and then allowed it to be referred to a commission where no one took any notice of it. In the course of this controversy it was found that the Shah, far from backing his Prime Minister and trying to moderate the factious criticism of the Deputies, rather encouraged the Deputies for fear lest the Majlis should disappear and he should be left face to face with an uncontrolled Qawam. This opposition between the Prime Minister and the Shah was another facet of the conflict which arose when % the Qawam took office, and, instead of following the usual custom of appointing to the Ministry of War a general who would be under the thumb of the Chief of Staff, kept the Ministry of War for himself, and, moreover, maintained that the Chief of Staff ought to report to him and not to the Shah. 6. The frivolous Deputies began to discuss a change of Government, but had no serious candidate to put forward as Prime Minister. A few irresponsibles proposed that the Qawam should be replaced by Soheily. the man who had contributed largely to the food crisis by his inactivity during the harvest period and whom the Majlis had driven out ignominiously a few months before. After the warning given to the President of the Majlis by the British and Russian representatives, the Deputies attacked the Prime Minister more furiously than ever : they had to give in on the question of currency, but they took revenge on the Prime Minister by alleging that it was through him that the Allies had obtained their distorted view of that patriotic, disinterested and always pro-iVlly Assembly. Not only the Deputies but the Shah also gave too little weight to the fact that the British, Soviet and United States representatives openly stated that the Qawam had worked with the Allies, that they saw no likelihood of securing a better Prime Minister, and that in any case changes of Government every few months were ruinous to public business, both Persian and Allied.3 acs y The Tehran Riots. \ ,Qi/rs^XCfC 7. Opposition to the Qawam culminated on the 8th and 9th December in an attempt to unseat him by disorders in the streets. The exact causes of the phenomena are under investigation by a special commission, and, as the most diverse explanations are given, we may await its finding. What is certain is that both police and army displayed, until it was too late, an amazing benevolence upwards the disorderly crowds, not merely the students who made a vague demonstration at the Majlis, but the mob which looted sugar depots and shops and eventually plundered the Prime Minister’s house and destroyed all his possessions. 8. Throughout the day the Shah seems to have been calling upon the Prime Minister to resign—even after he had told His Majesty’s Minister, who saw him in the afternoon, that he agreed to the retention of the Qawam provided that he made certain changes in his Cabinet and got rid of certain men round him wdio . are generally agreed to be corrupt. Those who think that the disorders were not ! displeasing to the Shah have some evidence on their side. There is no doubt that in an interview with about a dozen Deputies, whom he had summoned the day before the trouble, he spoke in favour of a revolution from above—to obviate a revolution from below which he professed to fear. Moreover, General Jahanbani of the Shah’s military Cabinet, who called on the Soviet Ambassador while the disorders were in progress to ask him in the Shah’s name what he thought of the position, also asked the ambassador how he would view it if the Shah and the generals took public affairs in hand for a while, and, although the Shah subsequently alleged that this latter question was thrown off by General Jahanbani on his own account in the course of the casual conversation, this explanation does not ring true or agree with the evidence. The Shah has, in fact, come out of the affair very badly. In taking sides so openly and so violently against a Prime Minister who was supported by the British, United States and Soviet representatives, without consulting them, he has shown a surprising lack of political wisdom : while his attempt to effect a military coup d’Etat illustrates his dangerous passion for playing at soldiers. It is true that he has throughout quoted democracy and his oath to preserve the Constitution as justifying his support of the Majlis against the Prime Minister; but he announced his readiness to dismiss the Majlis if a Government satisfactory to himself was formed and they continued to give trouble, while his alliance with the military suggested that he had in mind nothing particularly democratic, but some form of autocracy resting on the army. It is quite possible that he is genuinely sceptical of the old gang of some fifteen families who between them furnish nearly all the material of every Government, and regards himself as the philosopher-king, destined to bring justice and prosperity to the Persian people; but his youth, his inexperience and his blindness to the faults of the army, make him unfitted for this role, while j if those faults are reparable the untruthfulness and the talent for weak intrigue which have come to light during the crisis are likely to be more lasting. For the moment he professes to regret having made a mistake and to be prepared to support the Qawam, but he used the strongest pressure to make the Prime Minister consent to the reopening of the Majlis, and he shows no sign of giving up his claim to be the active Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Credit must, however, be given to him in one respect: he suggested two possible Ministers whose admittance to the Government in the place of two men of no great value would strengthen it, viz., Muhsin Rais and Mutamedi. The new Minister for War, Sipahbod Ahmedi, will also strengthen the Government—possibly too much for the Shah’s liking. He will certainly want to control the General Staff, and, as he is a man of determined character and courage, a conflict is bound to arise. 9. In view of the apparent inability of the Persian Government and army to maintain order, I thought it well to arrange for British troops to come to Tehran from Qum, only three hours away. The arrival of a battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders on the 9th December certainly had a calming effect, and their bearing and turn-out have made a generally favourable impression. Indeed I have not heard any criticism from any quarter: The Soviet Ambassador was officially informed of this arrival and asked whether Soviet troops would also be sent; he replied that there were none to spare. 10. For the moment the Prime Minister is established, but his revised Cabinet is not yet published, and much as we hoped that the Majlis would be given a prolonged holiday—“ for repairs ” would have been a reasonable pretext, since some slight change was done to it during the disorders—the Majlis was reopened on the 20th December. Meanwhile, a determined effort has been made by interested parties to show that the Prime Minister himself was responsible for [37—60] b 2 I4 the disorders. The events of recent weeks have shown that the Government and Sovereign of Persia must, in the end, do what the Allies want; but it has yet to be seen whether we can prevent the victimisation of a Government for acting in accordance with our wishes. Security Questions. 10a. Of the suspects at Sultanabad, eight have been released : the re^* remain in detention, the interrogation having established that there was goou ground for their being detained. Very late in the day a Persian commissioner and two senior Persian judges arrived. They have given no trouble at all, either in wishing to sway the verdict, or in being unduly critical of the conditions of detention. The search for Germans, and for Persian suspects whom the Persian police professed to be unable to find, has gone on : one German living in Tehran has been caught, and life has been made very risky for a number of other suspects. 11. In December it became essential to get rid of General Zahidi, General Officer Commanding, Isfahan, who had sabotaged wheat collection, made civil Government impossible, shown indifference if not hostility when Vice-Consul Harris and Dr. Griffiths were murdered, dealt with and harboured German agents and encouraged Nasir Qashgai and even supplied him with arms. This was at the moment when the Qawam Government seemed to be weakest, and the Prime Minister, who even at the best would have been afraid to touch so prominent an officer, would certainly have been unable to arrest him then, so it was decided that Zahidi should be taken by the British military authorities. The arrest was entrusted to Captain Fitzroy Maclean, M.P.. who, acting fortiter as a parachutist, but suaviter as an ex-secretary of embassy, effected it with brilliant ease. The Prime Minister and the Shah were both informed of Zahidi’s arrest as soon as possible and of the reasons for it. Both asked whether we could not have mentioned it beforehand, and received the explanation that it was desired not to embarrass them. The Shah said that he would have such people punished severely, even by death; but neither expressed the least surprise at the catalogue given above of the offences of which Zahidi is believed by us to be guilty. It is alleged in some quarters that the arrest of Zahidi by the British authorities has administered a severe blow to the morale of the Persian army, but this allegation comes in all probability from men who must know our real grounds for action and who have very uneasy consciences themselves. The Food Situation. 12. The arrival of Mr. Sheridan, the American Food Adviser, at the end of September, although it took place three months too late for any effective control of the 1942 harvest to be organised, has profoundly altered the situation. Shortly before his arrival, M. Farrukh was appointed Minister of Food in supersession of M. Ardalan. The newly-constituted Food Ministry was in the curious position of having no one among its senior officials with any direct knowledge of Persian wheat problems, but Mr. Sheridan, who is a man of great energy and drive, though apt to leap to hasty and ill-considered conclusions, was undaunted. He was unwilling to adopt the suggestion that he should discuss the situation with M. Bader, ex-Minister of Finance, before reaching any conclusions, but accepted instead the advice of Mr. Kahn, Economic Adviser to the Minister of State, who happened to be on a visit to Tehran and who urged that it was anomalous to try to maintain an official price of 1,400 to 1,800 rials (£11 to £14) against a price of £25 to £35 elsewhere in the Middle East—x-an argument which ignores the fact that the Indian price continues to be about £12 per ton. The unanimous opinion of a meeting of British officials with local knowledge, who were invited to meet Mr. Sheridan at the legation to discuss the situation, was unable to deter h'im from accepting Mr. Kahn’s advice, and the official price of wheat throughout the country was raised to 3,000 (and in some areas 3,500) rials a ton. 13. Parallel with the financial negotiations, though not officially linked with them, there were conversations about the food supply. In October the Prime Minister telegraphed to Mr. Churchill and the Shah to His Majesty The King, asking to be supplied with 25,000 tons of wheat and 150 lorries. Similar telegrams were sent to the United States. To ask for wheat when their own harvest was only just beginning to come in, and for transport, when they had delayed seven weeks to accept the Anglo-American proposals for a Road Transport Board and were still displaying little energy in making a complete survey of existing transport, seemed highly unreasonable; but evidence began to come to light, suggesting that the shortage of transport was perhaps rather greater than hadat first been supposed, while a sudden demand by the Soviet Government for 5,000 tons of wheat, 15,000 tons of barley (in addition to 6,000 tons aUeg^to be outstanding on a previous clearing arrangement) and 30,000 tons of nbe. compelled His Majesty’s Government to reconsider the matter. Eventually the Persian Government succeeded in concluding an agreement, which was signed after many delays on the 4th December, by which they recognised that the primary Responsibility for feeding the Persian people is theirs, and that they must take all possible steps to that end. including the utilisation to the best advantage of the internal transport at their disposal, while the British and United States Governments for their part undertake both to do their best to make up any deficit in bread cereals which, nevertheless, occurs, and also to ensure that the transport at the disposal of the Persian Government, if put to the proper use, shall be sufficient for the distribution of such cereals. It has been made clear to the Soviet Government and to the Soviet Ambassador in Tehran that the replacement from overseas of bread cereals purchasedi in Persia for the Russian forces will necessarily interfere to some extent with the carriage of goods and war material to Russia. 14. The internal wheat situation has already been separately described in my monthly reports. Briefly the position is that wheat collections in the provinces have continued to be most unsatisfactory. Other contributing causes, besides the economic earthquake caused by the sudden doubling of the official price, are : the failure to take any proper steps to put the new policy into effect, the traditional unwillingness of provincial authorities to co-operate with the Central Government, the reluctance of the Central Government to take any action against landowners and other hoarders of wheat, and, in Azerbaijan, the principal wheat growing area, the paralysis resulting from fear of Russian intentions and their repeated interference with attempts to export food-stuffs out of the province through their zone of occupation. 15. The Soviet Government has now officially promised to assist in the , transportation of grain from the north, and their local representatives have agreed to this being done, but obstruction still continues. Wheat for Khorassan has been held up at the Russian railhead at Shahrud, and interference at Kazvin has been so consistent that wheat from Hamadan and other western districts has to come by the long route via Arak, thus wasting badly-needed motor transport and adding to the congestion of north-bound traffic on the railway. Until the last few days no wheat had come in from Azerbaijan, the local Government has d6ne nothing to collect wheat in centres from which it could be easily transported to Tehran (or alternatively seized by the Russians), and* winter is now upon us, making transport in many districts impossible. The Persian Minister for Food has himself gone to Tabriz to try to relieve the situation, and British army lorries are carrying back loads of wheat from Azerbaijan southwards. 16. Meanwhile Tehran has consumed practically all the stocks available in the vicinity, has nearly exhausted the possible surplus from Arak, the only surplus area free from fear of Russian interference, and has been several times on the verge of starvation. The promise of the Allies to import 25.000 tons of wheat cannot begin to be effective for two months or more. The army is lending 1,500 tons of flour from its own stocks and efforts are being made to rush up from Basra 3,500 tons of barley promised from Iraq in September and October but only now in sight, and rice is beginning to come in from the north; but the task of the American Food Adviser, whose energies are almost entirely absorbed in the problem of Tehran’s bread supply, will not Be an enviable one for the next three months. Polish Refugees. 17. The unfortunate deterioration of the currency and food situation in Persia has made the Persians regard the Polish refugees who are here with growing disfavour. In Tehran there are still 19,000 and. it is calculated that this is an addition of about 8 per cent, to those inhabitants of Tehran who have a European standard of feeding. In order to ease the pressure of Polish buying on prices and supplies of food-stuffs, a scale of rationing has now been agreed with the Poles themelves, the representatives of Mena, the American Red Cross and the Persian authorities, including Mr. Sheridan, the American Adviser to the Ministry of Food, and it is hoped that this will serve to take some of the stim&gt;- out of Persian criticisms, though there is a movement to increase the intended rations slightly on the ground that it is insufficient to maintain in health people debilitated by two and a half years of malnutrition. Meanwhile an ever- [37-60] B 36 ?u increasing number of British and American personnel is coming here and there are growing difficulties in finding winter accommodation for the Polish refugees. I have explained in my telegrams how necessary it is from every point of view that the refugees should he moved on as soon as possible—I note that my anxieties are shared by the Minister of State and the Commander-in-chief, Persia-Iraq Command. A special problem is presented by some 900 Polish Jews, nearly all of them children, who have permission to go to Palestine, where every care awaits them, but cannot go there because the Iraqi Government, very sensitive on the question of the Zionist policy, will not give them transit visas. Military Interests. 18. Owing to the dilatoriness of the Persian administration we have had to take direct action in taking over a number of telegraph lines essential for military communications between Tehran and Bagdad, and Malayer and Andimeshk. I informed the Prime Minister on the 19th September that it was an urgent military necessity to take over these lines in accordance with article 3 (2) (b) of the Treaty of Alliance. In spite of direct representations to the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones, and of conversations with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the subject, no progress was made for the two months during which diplomatic correspondence continued. On the 18th November I informed the Prime Minister that I was unable to ask the British military authorities to postpone any longer the assumption of the essential facilities in question and that the military authorities would proceed to take over these lines. Other lines are available for civil use on the same routes and the line from Tehran to Bagdad has, as a matter of fact, only been in use intermittently for the last six months, and then only for short periods, owing to the inefficiency of the Persian administration. 19. The Persian Government have since informed me of their understanding of the importance of the question and of their regret at the delay—and also at the unilateral action taken. I have not heard of any local incidents having been caused by what we have done. 20. In the case of Mahrabad aerodrome, near Tehran, we were more fortunate. Although it was the last aerodrome near Tehran at the free disposal of'the Persian Air Force, we were able to arrange for it to be handed over to the R.A.F. in return for assistance to the Persian Air Force in training their pilots, helping them to effect their transfer to Isfahan, and so on. We are greatly indebted to Group Captain Greenlaw,^Air Attache to this Legation, for his skilful handling of these negotiations. 21. We have also succeeded in arranging for a special military governor to be appointed to Abadan Island. Owing to its enormous strategic importance, security and administrative problems require special treatment at Abadan; the new governor, Colonel Natemi, will be assisted by a British adviser, and will have special powers to control persons entering and leaving the area. At the same time the British military authorities will supplement the pay of the police, which is so low that they are quite unreliable, by giving them food rations and it is hoped that this, with a recent increase in the British Military Security Establishment at Abadan, will improve the situation radically. It is expected that it will soon be possible for fire-fighting training bv British subjects to be made compulsory in the oil industry areas. 22. In September it was suggested to the Persian Government that they should follow the example of the Iraqi Government in arranging for premises required by the British military authorities to be requisitioned by the Persian authorities who would make the necessary agreement with the owners. After a delay of two months a reply was received, stating that the law did not provide for such an arrangement and that to try to obtain such a law from the Majlis would meet with difficulty. It was just at this moment that the Majlis, scared by the British and Soviet representations and by the Allied victories, were revealing- wells of pro-Allied feeling which had hitherto remained hidden and His Majesty’s Legation called attention to this satisfactory phenomenon and suggested that on the contrary the Majlis would presumably be delighted to show such a mark of enthusiasm for the Allied cause, the more so as it would tend to keep down rents. The quarrel between the Prime Minister and the Majlis was then at its height, so that no legislation in the sense required was to be hoped for and His Majesty’s Legation had to inform the Prime Minister that he must not be surprised if the British military authorities in Sultanabad were compelled, in the last resort, to take premises required by them for essential purposes. The Prime Minister7 7, asked whether we could not tell him what premises we heeded, so that he might see what could be done. His Majesty’s Minister said that he would ask for a list but he gave no undertaking that action would be delayed while the list was considered. Within the last few days the billeting situation has become acute in Tehran also. Fortunately, the Prime Minister feels that his position is stronger and he has promised His Majesty’s Minister to obtain from the Majlis under the Double WJrgency rule a Rent Restriction Act which will benefit all tenants and will include provisions for requisitioning premises required by the Allied forces. He agreed that if the British forces were compelled to enter into possession, before the passing of the proposed Act, of any of the premises for which they are at present negotiating, they might do so on handing over to the owner a written undertaking to pay rent on the scale to be fixed, either under the projected Rent Restriction Act or by arbitration. The American Legation are equally interested in this matter, and propose to press the Prime Minister to present the Bill before the Majlis without delay. 23. In two or three other cases the Prime Minister has taken advantage of the lull after the storm of the 8th December to give favourable decisions on questions which had been the subject of inconclusive discussion for some time. In particular it is now agreed that the Persian customs authorities on the Iraqi border will not interfere with lorries carrying goods for the British army; to prevent smuggling, such lorries will be searched by the British military authorities, who will then furnish a certificate which will serve as a pass for the purpose of the Persian customs. There still remains the problem of finding the means to compensate the Persian Treasury for any loss of customs dues resulting from the presence of British forces in Persia, e.q. y where goods which would normally have been exported and paid export dues are being consumed in Persia or exported to Iraq as military stores and thereby escaping customs inspection. American Interests. 24. Preparations are being made to increase enormously the American participation in aid to Russia. From present calculations it seems that soon there will be five times as many Americans working on railway and road transport and ports as there are British employed at present. This should increase the volume of material delivered to Russia through Persia. On the other hand, the presence of so large a number of highly-paid foreigners increases the competition H for local produce and will tend to raise prices still further. An unusual security problem is presented by the scheme to run frequent American motor convoys up and down the Bushire-Shiraz road by night as well as by day. It has been laid down that none of the Americans in Persia are to be combatant troops, and that security for this road (as elsewhere in Persia) is to be ensured by the British military authorities, who naturally do not wish to employ valuable combatant troops to guard communications : the question thus becomes mainly political. 25. The closest co-operation is maintained with the American Legation and the American advisers to the various departments—supplies, gendarmerie and police. As the United States share in the war effort in Persia increases, more and more American experts are attached to the American Legation, and all the help and information that His Majesty’s Legation can afford is placed at their disposal. The Americans appear to be gratified by the proposal of His Majesty’s Minister, which has been acted upon, that, in addition to the British, American and Persian members of the Road Transport Board, a second American. Mr. Kidd, as Lease-Lend representative, shall always be present at the meetings! 26. ^ The Persian Government are pleased at the greater share which the United States is taking in this country, as they consider it an additional guarantee of their independence and integrity; but before agreeing to the replacement of the British staff on the railway by Americans they wish to have the written assent of the British and Russian representatives in Tehran. Ours has been given; the Soviet Ambassador, though glad to hear of the speeding-up of aid to Russia, which the advent of large numbers of Americans is to secure, is awaitino- instruc tions from Moscow before giving any assurance on this subject. Soviet Interests. 27. Soviet consular officials at Kermanshah have visited tribal areas and apparently given ingratiating messages to various chiefs. In Azerbaijan the Soviet authorities have shown some suspicion of British intentions, but on the other hand they appear, probably because the danger of a German invasion of Persia has receded, to have thrown over the Kurds, who are thus left with no8 friends. Lhe standing instructions to the Soviet authorities in Persia are, they say, not to interfere in the internal affairs of Persia, hut this does not prevent their blocking the appointment to a Cabinet post of M. Taddayvun, whom the Prime Minister much wishes to appoint, putting the strongest pressure (including refusal to allow wheat supplies to pass from the Russian zone to f eh ran) in order to secure grain and other food supplies from the Persian Government, or squeezing the Persian Government to sign two high^ disadvantageous agreements—one financial, the other about the use of tn3* armament factories. 1 he last-minute help from the Soviet Ambassador undoubtedly contributed largely to the solution of the currency crisis—a crisis which would not have arisen if the Soviet Government had adopted the same financial policy as ourselves from the beginning. I he Soviet authorities now need to obtain large sums in rials from the Government, but they are apparently unwilling to offer the terms embodied in our financial agreement, but have put foiwaid a draft which, though wrapped up in the form Qf a clearing agreement, in fact binds Persia to give unlimited rial credits to Russia, subject 'to a six- monthly settlement by which the balance due to Persia would be paid in Moscow : (1) as to 40 per cent, in gold, which could he transferred to Persia, but at the risk of the Persian Government; and (2) as to the rest in dollars, which would in practice be frozen until after the war, since they could only be spent in America, and then only if the Persian Government had no other dollars at its disposal. The Soviet Government are also pressing the Persian Government to sign a contract for the operation of the Persian armament factories. After a year of somewhat dog-in-the-manger policy towards His Majesty’s Government they want to get the factories into full production by the middle of 1943. The Persian Government are very reluctant to sign, as they consider (with some reason) that the terms are very onerous, and fear that the inevitable influx of Soviet specialists, and possibly workmen, will have a disturbing political influence. It appears that the Persian Government are to pay the expenses—salaries and wages, cost of extia machinery provided by the Soviet Government, &amp;c., while the Soviet Government will pay for the arms delivered (less specified deductions for any delay) in iinls obtained, presumably, under the proposed financial agreement His Majesty’s Minister communicated to the Soviet Ambassador information obtained about subversive movements affecting Russian as well as British interests. It was hoped that the Soviet authorities might be induced to arrest an important Persian suspect hostile to them at the time of the arrest of General Zahidi But although the Soviet Ambassador seemed gratified to secure the valuable informa tion conveyed to him, he has received no instructions from his Government about ' the suggested arrest, and we have, therefore, been obliged, as usual to act alone Internal Affairs. 28. The whole of Persia is suffering from the paralysis which political crises m the capital always spread throughout the country. The Kermanshah area m particular has suffered, and it has so far proved impossible to secure a Governor-General who would be likely to instil energy into the Administration. It is m Pars, however, that the effect of weakness in the Central Government has been most clearly shown. Puffed up by flattery from German agents and also there is good reason to believe, by encouragement from General Zahidi’ n !rv ^ iec ^ i° secure recognition by the Persian Government as head of f, . le Qashgai a fantastic claim. The Prime Minister has consistently resisted this claim and indeed, has refused to discuss matters unless Nasir comes to lehran, where his life would be protected by a Government guarantee and his chaims would be discussed. The Governor-General and the G.O.C., Pars I rince tirouz for long refused on various pretexts to take action against Nasir’ ,. en tne d to disarm the Qashgai on their migration south, with no result but disgrace to Persian arms and the loss of sixty rifles and three machine guns. the situation is (letter now it is not due to the Persian army, but to the series of shocks administered to Nasir by the Allied victories, the discovery, which must be obvious to him, of some of his intrigues with the Axis, and the arrest and removal of Zahidi Nasir is still manoeuvring to secure the best possible terms his position rSian Government ’ but each message suggests a slight weakening of 29. The Persians lament the danger from Russia, but there is no indication whatsoever that any of them realise that the best.defence is a good Administration and a contented people. Corruption is almost universal: bon Iranien vole de race. Ol the American advisers struggling in this morass, Mr. Sheridan in9 the Ministry of Food, puts his faith in one rogue after another, while Colonel Schwarzkopf (gendarmerie) and Mr. Timmerman (police) have n&lt;p contracts and therefore no power. The most urgently needed advisers, Dr. Millspaugh and his eight assistants, who are to work for the Ministry of Finance, are still awaited. It is a fairly safe prophecy that the Americans will be tolerated during the war, as a bait for lease-lend and a defence against Russia ''■'^d Great Britain, but that after the war their struggle with the vanity, jealousy x -Ad corruption of Persian officialdom will be very fierce. 30. General Ridley, of the United States Army, who has been engaged on drawing up a scheme for the reorganisation of the Persian army, has his proposals now ready for presentation to the Shah. As far as they are known to me they are sound and reasonable. They entail the provision of certain equipment, notably transport and means of communication, and a considerable increase in the military budget to cover essential increases in pay and improve ments in conditions for officers and men. Such an increase is an inevitable first step in any reform, since the present rates of pay of officers make dishonesty a necessity. It is moral reform more than reorganisation that is required in the Persian army. 31. It lacks an ideal and an incentive; it is rent by political intrigue and rotten with corruption. Schemes of reorganisation will effect little unless an adequately staffed American mission has the executive authority to ensure the moral reform. A mission with such powers will find both support and opposition in the Persian army. The Shah, anxious that his control of and influence in the army should be in no way restricted and shutting his eyes to the prevalent abuses, is, according to my present information, averse from giving to the officers of an American mission the wide powers without which they can achieve little. 1 shall miss no opportunity of endeavouring to persuade him to do so, as it is presumably in our interests that endeavours should be made to render the Persian army capable at least of maintaining internal security, of protecting our lines of communication and of giving that physical support which is essential to any Government in Persia. The main cause of its present inefficiency is its lack of the right spirit. 94 Road Transport. 32. There is now operating in Persia a system of Allied control of all kinds of road transport and, in particular, of motor transport. For the last two months an informal committee, consisting of Persian, British and American members, has been working on the compilation of regulations governing road transport and on preparing the ground for the constitution of a more formal road transport board with full x\llied representation. Having formulated the text of the regulations considered necessary, the English text of which was sent to the Foreign Office under cover of my despatch No. 421 E. of the 10th December, this committee dissolved itself to make way for a new board, which has now been set up by the Governments concerned, with a Persian chairman, two American repre sentatives (one a member of the American Legation and the other the Lease-Lend representative), one British representative and one Russian representative. In addition, the board has the right to co-opt as required other persons connected with civilian road transport. 33. The Road 1 ransport Board has already held a number of meetings and is considering certain important matters requiring more or less immediate settle ment. It is now in a position, it is hoped, to exert effective control of existing civil transport facilities in Persia. It is too early to say whether this control will be completely effective, but it should, in any case, bring about an improvement in the situation. The Road Transport Board has direct control over the activities of the Persian Government Road Transport Department (Edareh Barbari Rah), which is a section of the Ministry of Supply. This department is directly responsible for operating the vehicles contracted to the Persian Government, and will also be responsible for the vehicles to be allocated to Persia under the Middle East civilian quota. It also controls the distribution of Persian Government tyres and of certain motor vehicle spare parts in short supply, such as batteries, sparking plugs and electric wiring. 34. The Edareh Barbari Rah has a British director, who attends the weekly meetings of the Road Transport Board. The latter thus indirectly controls already a large part of the transport working for the Persian Govern ment, and this control will apply soon to all transport in the possession of the Persian Government and to all lorries in private ownership. &lt; CO10 35. Arrangements have been made with General Headquarters, Paic, for the use of back-loading facilities in U.K.C.C. transport carrying supplies to Russia for essential Persian civil requirements. It is hoped in this way to make the utmost use of all transport facilities available, whether in the service of the U.K.C.C. or of the Persian Government, for essential civil needs; and the Road Transport Board will maintain constant touch with the D.Q.M.G. (Movements), Tehran, to maintain the efficient use of these facilities. It is hoped, however, when the Persian Government builds up its own fleet of lorries the calls on ti U.K.C.C. for help in providing transport will be correspondingly reduced. At present it is necessary for the latter to provide transport which often conflicts with the needs of supplies to Russia. The more the Persian Government can do for itself, the less this service will be interrupted. Similarly, it is most necessary that the Persian Government should have its own stocks of tyres and spare parts with which to maintain the vehicles under its control, and it is hoped that arrangements now being made by the M.E.S.C. and the agreement of General Headquarters, Paic, to return a number of tyres consigned to the Persian Govern ment requisitioned earlier in the year will before long result in the Persian Government having at least the minimum of tyres and spares necessary for this purpose. Conclusion. 36. The disorders of the 8th December have cleared the air somewhat. Those who troubled the waters, or tried to fish in them, have been taken somewhat aback by the courage shown by the Qawam and the support accorded to him by the Allies, while the Qawam,'apparently grateful for this support, has settled two or three questions which had been discussed fruitlessly for some time, and has made oil the Tehran wireless the first strongly pro-Ally speech made by a Persian since the occupation. But it must not be concluded that the danger is over. The Shah has been humiliated, and the fact that it is his own fault does not make it any easier to bear; nor will the army cease their attempt to remain outside the competence of the Ministry of War and under the nominal orders of a Shah whom they in fact influence strongly if they do not actually control him. The Deputies have been brought to order for the moment, but, like most Persians, they are incurably light-minded, and they will always prefer the intoxication of irresponsible criticism to more useful labour on urgent unspectacular reforms. The press is closed down for the moment, except for a Government sheet, and the Government have not yet decided what to do with the newspapers—factious and irresponsible at the best, and, at the worst, organs of almost open blackmail. The prospects of the Allies in Persia are brighter as a result of the victories in North Africa and Russia; but the food problem, the problem of the rise in prices which the growing expenditure in currency is bound to accentuate, and the confusion which seems likely to characterise the period of transfer of railways and other means of aid to Russia from British to American hands will occupy our minds and energies for the next few months, when we are not busy with one of the frequent and harmful political crises which the Persians regard with such childish equanimity. 37.

Tkii E lyJZtf/yfcf i r &gt; Tehran, August 12, 1942. k. k L j# /- THE trial of the former Chief of Police, General Rukn-ud-Din Mukhtari, on~ ^ various charges, including complicity in murder, has caused a considerable ta. eAte**!* ffi. sensation at Tehran during the past few weeks. Although the sentence has not * • yet been pronounced, I have the honour to forward in this despatch a short report*/ ^ on the trial up to the moment of writing. I hope to submit a further report when u/\dju\ the sentence of the court is pronounced. ^ v ^ 2. Mukhtari, who became acting head of police on tihe departure of Muhammad Hussein Ay rum in 1936, held that post from that date until the abdication of Reza Shah in September 1941. During the last few days of Reza Shah’s reign, Mukhtari fled to Kerman and was popularly supposed to have been entrusted by the late Shah with the Crown Jewels, which were to be sent abroad. However, when it became apparent that the Russian troops were not to occupy Tehran to the exclusion of British troops. Mukhtari returned to the capital. It appears that the story of the jewels was false. Mukhtari’s own story is that he was told by the Shah to make his escape from the Russians while he could. Mukhtari always maintained that he had had to carry out so many of the Shah’s orders against Soviet nationals or suspected Soviet agents in this country that he felt his life would be in grave danger if he found himself at the mercy of the Soviet authorities. 3. Towards the end of 1941 it was decided to arrest him, and he has been a prisoner in Tehran ever since. News of the progress of his trial has been published in the press from time to time, and articles, mostly of an abusive nature, have appeared in various papers, describing with gradually increasing severity the charges which were being made against him. The general impression which these articles sought to create was that Mukhtari had been responsible for the oppression, the imprisonments and the various acts of tyranny against persons which had been committed during his tenure of office. 4. The indictment against Mukhtari. prepared by the Public Prosecutor, is an extremely long document and deals in detail with a great number of different charges. The principal accusations are of complicity in the execution, or murder, of the following well-known persons : Seyyid Hassan Mudarris, Prince Firouz (Nusrat ed Douleh), Abdul Hussein Diba* and Sheikh Khazal, the Sheikh of Muhammerah. Other charges included the detention in prison of several prisoners after the expiry of their proper term of imprisonment, and irregu larities in the trial of certain persons suspected of spying for tihe Soviet Govern ment. In several places the indictment contained the statement that “ in this matter Mukhtari misled the Shah ” (i.e., the ex-Shah Reza), and also the argument that Mukhtari’s defence that he was acting under orders of the late Shah was inadmissible, usually because the Shah had not given written orders. A number of other prisoners were cited in the indictment, all of whom appear to have been police officers or persons employed by the police, the most important of them being Captain Abdullah Miqdadi of the Tehran “ Police de SJirete.” It appeared to many readers of the indictment that it was drawn up with the object of visiting on Mukhtari the sms of the ex-Shah—in fact, with the suggestion that the late Shah was a benevolent ruler deceived by unworthy and evil subordinates. Such a complete perversion of the truth ought not to have deceived even the most simple-minded persons; but it is clear that a great deal of popular indignation had been worked up against Mukhtari before the trial started. It must be remembered that the relatives of Mudarris, of Nusrat ed Douleh, of Diba, and of the considerable number of landowners and suspects who had suffered under the Pahlevi were all longing for revenge, and it was not unnatural that their hatred and thirst for revenge should be concentrated on the executive head of police under Reza Shah. It is easy to forget, in these days ■of f*ee speech, the iron discipline of Reza’s reign. The ex-Shah took a close RECd. F OL. [ 83 --^] . . ) 3 £P Qrf*L.\JL, ,«Jt U nr. . INDIA OFFICE !2 * ^ , A U .1' ■ * \\ A personal interest in every detail of the work of the police, and it is inconceivable that Mukhtari would have dared to do the smallest thing-without making a full report to Reza Shah, who was so far above any kind of criticism or control that if Mukhtari had ventured to ask his Royal master to put anything, in writing the most probable result would have been a severe kick from the Royal boot. \or is it convenient for the public to remember that, if Mukhtari was guilty of slavish obedience to the Shah, his guilt in that respect was shared by a very large numbe/^ of other Government servants who vied with one another in expressing the mo? fulsome praise for whatever the Shah did. * 5. The trial began on the 25th July. The court was the tribunal created for the hearing of charges against Government servants, and Mukhtari’s numerous 'enemies were not long in discovering that that court was not empowered to award a capital sentence. There was a considerable outcry on this point; a Bill was introduced in the Majlis on the 4th August for the purpose of ensuring that in future all persons accused of complicity in the crime of murder should be tried before the criminal courts which could award a death sentence; but it was soon realised that to pass this Bill would take too long for it to affect the present trial. 6. The first day of the trial was the occasion of long and highly coloured articles in all the Tehran papers, full of phrases such as the following: “ Mukhtari, the agent of Reza Shah, foremost in working the machinery of tyranny, and a shedder of blood comparable to Jenghiz Khan or Tamuriane, appeared trembling at the seat of justice There was Mukhtari, who used to be able to ruin a hundred families with one stroke of his pen, now trembling before the inexorable retribution which justice is about to exact.” 7. I do not think it necessary to weary you with a detailed analysis of the lengthy arguments and cross-examinations which took place during the trial. They were all reported in full in many of the Tehran papers. The depositions of the accused were confused and contradictory, and were for the most part denied by the accused when cross-examined by the court. The case of the murder of Khazal ought perhaps to be mentioned here : the prosecution’s argument was that the sheikh was strangled by three or four people at the orders of Mukhtari and with the connivance of one of the sheikh’s sons, and that after the strangling had taken place one of the murderers pierced his forehead with a knife to make some blood flow. Mukhtari’s defence was that the sheikh died a natural death, as was certified by a Tehran doctor at the time. It seems peculiarly pointless for the aged sheikh to have been murdered at all, for he was a bedridden old man, very ill with diabetes and incapable of doing any harm; in fact, it was common knowledge that he was dying in any case. 8. Mukhtari’s defence was a denial of all the charges, particularly the eharge that he had kept persons in prison after their term had expired : he had invariably sent reports to the judicial authorities (and no doubt also to the Shah): not one of the Ministers of Justice had ever made any comments or raised any questions concerning anything he had done. He had merely executed the orders he received. 9. One of the Majlis Deputies, named Siqat-ul-Islami, spoke in the Majlis on the 4th August to the following effect: Everyone who had participated in the Government and the administration of the last regime ought to be put on trial; if Mukhtari was evil, so was the whole former Government; all the Ministers and responsible officials of those days ought to be brought to trial as Mukhtari’s accomplices. And one of the defending advocates, named Dr. Muhit, caused bitter criticism from many of those who are thirsting for revenge by his statement that in the days of Reza Shah there was no real law and no real Executive except in the person of the Shah himself. 10. A good deal of popular feeling is being whipped up by various interested parties for their own ends. Printed slips of paper bearing the following statements, in Persian, have reached this legation : “ Mukhtari has made children fatherless, wives husbandless,” &amp;c., “ Hundreds of innocent women have expired under the kicks of Mukhtari’s jack-boots; to-day the judges of the criminal court must avenge them.” As usual, the British are, obscurely, sometimes supposed to be mixed up in the trial. For reasons which are not obvious this legation is accused of shielding and protecting Mukhtari. Anonymous letters have been written to this legation warning us that if we protect Mukhtari not only will the “ hate of the Persians increase against the British, but it might lead to other things which might not have a good effect ” . 11. It seems inevitable that Mukhtari will be sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. One thing appears to be in Mukhtari’s favour, though it is not3 likely that the court will take it into consideration; it is the fact that no one has accused him of lining his pockets, as he might easily have done; in fact, he seems to be a comparatively poor man, though had he wished to do so he could have followed the example of his predecessor Ayrum and accumulated a large fortune. 12. 1 he two chief workers against Mukhtari have been Muzaffar Firouz, *&gt;y tjie son of Nusrat ed Douleh, and a person named Pur-Reza. The latest develop- lent arising out of the trial is a notice which appeared in the press of the 1 9th August saying that Muhammad Nasir Khan, the eldest son of Ismail Khan Soul at ed Douleh Qashqai, demanded that the assassination of his father should be the subject of judicial enquiry : a strange demand from a man who has been defying the Persian Government ever since he fled from its custody during the confusion of the events of last August. In actual fact, there is hardly any doubt that Soulat ed Douleh was killed, probably poisoned, by direct order of Reza ^hah : but that would not prevent that charge being brought against Mukhtari as well. 13. I have reported at some length on this trial because it has aroused so much public interest here, and because, as it brings the misdeeds of the ex-Shah into the public eye, it cannot be altogether without its effect on the position of the dynasty. Indeed, the Shah is known to be embarrassed by the feeling which 1ms found expression against his father. It is, however, to be hoped that the trial will not begin a series of retributory executions or sentences of imprison ment. and in the interests of all parties I propose to use my influence discreetly to encourage people, so far as possible, to let bygones be bygones. .14 I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister of State, Cairo, the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, and to the General Officer Commanding, Xth Army, Iraq.

Sir, -(Redeiced October 22.) Copy No. Vi 112 /. tl/dfetL, O Tehran, September 22,^1942. I HAVE the honour to inform you that, notwithstanding the serious military /) /^tl situation in Russia, a certain change for the better has occurred here since II wrote mv despatch No. 248 of the 28th July , mainly as a sequel of the replacement of M. Ali Soheily by Qawam es Saltaneh as Prime Minister and the latter’s somewhat unexpected display of energy. During the last days of the Soheily Government things went from bad to worse. The Prime Minister seemed to have lost all control of the situation, and it was widely rumoured that he was engaging in various forms of corruption himself. There was no limit to the inefficiency of the Administration, the vacillation of the Government, or the irresponsibility of the Deputies. Indeed, Soheily had apparently lost ali confidence in himself and was quite unable to take any decision. It was a real relief when he resigned on the 30th July and was replaced by Qawam es Saltaneh. Details of the develop ment of the Cabinet crisis have been described separately^ in my telegrams and in my d espatc h No. 270. 2. The new Prime Minister, who belongs to the older generation of land- owners, is showing himself to be a vigorous, determined and sometimes obstinate old gentleman, but after an initial period in which, as will be described below, the utmost difficulties have been experienced in securing even our essential desiderata, he now seems to be settling down well. On receiving your telegram No. 10 7-Q-of.. the 29th July, I informed the Shah that His Majesty s Government would accept any Government which the Persians might set up, provided that it would co-operate energetically with the Allies, and it is now justifiable to hope that the present Government will, for the time being at any rate, fulfil this requirement. Soon after taking office the Prime Minister made it clear to me that he did not intend to stand any nonsense from the Majlis, and he has also told the Soviet Ambassador that he proposed to remind them as often as might be necessary that their authority did not rest on popular approval. Qawam has been as good as his word, and his firmness has greatly increased his reputation, both among the public and among the Deputies themselves. 3. Generally speaking, we need a Prime Minister here in present circum stances who is either a respectable and influential person who is prepared and able to secure acceptance of our essential war requirements by his countrymen or, in the last resort, one who is open toother inducements. In view of the present unwillingness of various suitable personalities to take office (e.g., M. Pirnia), Qawam es Saltaneh seems to be almost the only candidate of the first category. I am, however, anxious to have some alternative ready, and the oriental secretary is accordingly going to Palestine very shortly in order to see Said Zia ed din Tabatabai. Security Questions. 4. energy. l-Kti. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has carried out his duties with some One of the most difficult questions outstanding when Soheily resigned was undoubtedly our request for the handing over of eighteen Persians known co be engaged in Axis activities. Whilst Soheily delivered to us a few Germans and Persians already under detention, no action was taken by him in regard to the list of eighteen before he fell from office. In the early days of the Government a new list of over forty persons, who were believed by us to be definitely incrimi nated, was submitted to the Persian Government with a request for their arrest and delivery to the British military authorities. I explained in paragraphs 5-6 of mv despatch No 248 why it was considered essential for suspects to be guarded ^ and interrogated by ourselves, although we well realised how difficult it was for the Persians to hand over their own nationals to the authorities of a foreign Power in their own country. Although Qawam proceeded to arrest the persons concerned, he obstinately refused to hand over the Persians, and it became clear p 7 / b H ■t'J- 'X 75^ .that he was not strong enough to do this. Meanwhile, the question was handled by the police with an ineptitude and laxity typical of Persia. One of the principal suspects, hrau Bernstein, a German, known to be the link between the Axis agents in bars and those in i ehran, was, after her arrest, allowed to return to her house, where she committed suicide. The house was still unguarded hours after her death and her papers were not seized. Another woman, supposed to have been arrested, was found making a complaint inside His Majesty’s Legation; and one^ German arrested was found to have been hidden for six months in the house of ar Persian police officer. While they were under detention a number of those arrested were known to be communicating with persons outside, and one prisoner was inexplicably found by us to have acquired a sum of money and some playing cards in the course of the night. It was all too obvious that, if serious action was to be taken against the fifth column in Persia, the guarding and interrogation must be done mainly by ourselves and that the prisoners must be confined some where in the British zone and not in Tehran, where their friends and relatives would be inconveniently near. We made it clear that, subject to this, we were willing to make every conceivable concession to save the Persian face, but Qawam es Saltaneh resolutely refused to hand over any Persians to us and stood out for detention in Tehran itself. In this the Prime Minister was doubtless encouraged probably by the fact that w T e received no help from the Soviet Embassy and none from the American Legation until it was too late, when a very mild demarche in our favour was made by Mr. Dreyfus. It is only now, after weeks of negotiation, after the Persian Government have (fruitlessly) appealed to the Foreign Office through the Persian Minister in London, and, finally, I must add, after a straight warning that we shoiild judge the sincerity of the Persian Government in colla boration with us by its attitude over this question, that a reasonable agreement has at last been reached on this subject. I am reporting separately on'this and wbll only record here for convenience and to make the story complete that the agreement provides for the detention of all Persian suspects at Sultanabad, where there are British troops, and for the association of Persian officials with the British authorities in the supervision and interrogation of such suspects. In actual fact, we should have real control in both respects. It is hoped that this agreement will work smoothly, but the arrest and handing over of Persians is bound to be unpopular and we must expect to encounter difficulties if we have to present the Persian Government with further lists of Persian suspects. Financial Situation. 5. Another question which has presented the greatest difficulties is the purchase of rial currency with sterling and dollars. The currency is essential to enable the British military authorities to pay the labour used on the roads and on the numerous other works of military importance which we are undertaking in this country. This question appeared to have been settled by the Financial Agreement of the 26th May, 1942. 6. By the middle of August 1942, however, it had become evident that a further increase in the Persian note-issue was inevitable to meet the growing demand for currency. The note-issue had last been increased by an Act of the 31st March, 1942, which added 700 million rials to the previous authorised maximum of 2,000 million rials, bringing the total of the legal issue tp 2,700 million rials. 7. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Financial Agreement of tlfa 26th May, 1942 (in which the Persian Government undertakes, inter alia, to maintain an adequate supply of rials to meet the expenditure in Persia of His Majesty’s Government), the Persian Government viewed with reluctance the prospect of going to the Majlis with a Bill to add to the note circulation. Con siderable pressure from His Majesty’s Legation was necessary before the Government could be induced to take the necessary steps. 8. At the request of the Government I gave an estimate of 1,000 million rials as the probable additional needs in local currency over the twelve months beginning the 1st September, 1942. I pointed out that this estimate was necessarily conjectural, that it was bound to be hedged about by provisos and reservations, and that it must not be regarded as in any sense an indication to the Persian Government of the maximum requirements of His Majesty’s Government. 9. Meanwhile the new Prime Minister had set up an unofficial commission to study and report on a long-term policy in relation to the note-issue of the country, particularly with respect to the arrangements that might be made for3 its “ cover.” This commission had not concluded its deliberations (in fact, it is still studying the question) by the time that the currency situation had become so acute that immediate action by the Government and the Majlis was necessary if a crisis was to be averted. 10. Finally, as I reported i n my telegram No. 1168 , the Majlis passed a Bill on the 12th September, 1942, authorising an increase in the note-issue of a further *V 300 million rials, thus bringing the total authorised issue to a new maximum of 3,000 million rials. The additional issue is statutorily “backed” by the existing “ coin.” 11. This measure is in the nature of a stop-gap until the Government has decided its long-term policy. The additional issue should suffice for probable needs during seven or eight weeks at current rate of British expenditure. 12. Under pressure from the Prime Minister the Bill passed through the Majlis without much difficulty by 75 votes to 1, with 11 abstentions. In the course of the debate, however, there was much uninformed and a certain amount of hostile criticism. Fears were expressed lest the increase in the supply of money might raise the already high cost of living, and the general tone of the debate as published in the local press ascribed the whole responsibility for the increased cost of living to Persia’s obligation to supply His Majesty’s Govern ment with their large requirements of local currency. The Government spokesman did little to dispel this. 13. I have pointed out to the Persian Government that efficacious remedies against inflation are at the disposal of the Government itself, and that only by introducing and, above all, enforcing additional taxation, legislation to prevent hoarding and cornering, price control, and the various other appropriate measures of the kind can the cost of living in present circumstances be kept within reasonable bounds. The Prime Minister has assured me that all these questions are now engaging the active attention of his colleagues and himself. 14. In view of the bias given to the subject by the press report of the debate, I am making arrangements for press articles and a radio broadcast on the subject, to place before the public the degree of responsibility for the present situation that rests on the shoulders of the Persian Government itself, and the extent to which the remedies to improve it lie in the Government’s own hands. And I am also suggesting to the Prime Minister that even if anti-Allied speeches are made in the Majlis, that is no reason why they should be published and create unnecessary difficulties for the Government and for ourselves. The Food Supply. 15.. The proposal for a Food Board mentioned in paragraph 19 of my ^V&gt; despatch No. 248 of the 28th July did not materialise, but in accordance with our views the Prime Minister has established a separate Directorate of Food and the Minister, M. Ardalan, has worked in close co-operation with Mr. Squire, counsellor at this legation. The Prime Minister has sent telegraphic instructions to all governors in the provinces that the collection of wheat is their most important duty and that the severest measures, including the death penalty, are to be taken against hoarders. 16. One of the principal difficulties in dealing with the food problem in Persia is that local authorities are afraid to take action against powerful landowners. The consular liaison officer scheme has, for this reason, not altogether fulfilled our original hopes that it would frighten the landowners into ready delivery of their surplus grain, but it has given us a means of checking on the spot whether or not the orders of the Central Government are being carried out and has brought an increase of strength to our hard-worked consulates in coping with this most difficult problem. Landowners’ declarations of their wheat surplus available for purchase at the official price were due to be in the hands of the authorities by the 22nd September, but it is already clear that provincial officials will make little effort to obtain more than local requirements and will leave Tehran and the deficit areas of the south to fend for themselves, although the harvest has, generally speaking and with the exception of some localities, been good. Disappointed in their request made in London for 120,000 tons of wheat, the Persian Government are now starting to take measures to buy wheat from the peasants at the free price in a number of areas and to pay the peasants for their surplus grain partly in cash and partly in much-needed piece-goods, sugar, &amp;c. The areas at present affected are along the Iraqi frontier, and it was hoped that this procedure might stop smuggling which, owing to the great disparity between the official Persian price and the price of grain in Iraq, was denuding those districts of grain. [35—6] b 217. The Persian Government have asked for the co-operation of British consular liaison officers in arranging these purchases. Other concessions have also been made at our request to facilitate the procedure for the collection of grain in country districts. Transport Question. 18. Another vital question is transport. Persia’s economy now depends to a great extent on road transport, but hitherto there has been no attempt at strict control of the declining stock of tyres or the diversion of lorries from non-essential to essential purposes. The U.K.C.C. had for some months been negotiating with the Persian Government to obtain powers to carry out the much needed measures of rationalisation themselves but the Americans, who supply the tyres and are in a position to make their views felt in this question, have shown themselves very sensitive to any suggestion that a monopoly might be created, and the negotiations with the U.K.C.C. were, therefore, not successful. The proposal for a transport board mentioned in paragraph 19 of my despatch No. 248 has, however, been approved by the Persian Government. A committee to control road transport has been set up with Persian, British and American representation. Mr. Birkle, formerly of the U.K.C.C., has been engaged by the Persian Government to advise and assist them in rationalising and controlling road transport, and Sir Arthur Parsons is to be the official British representative on the committee. Persian records of the registration of vehicles, which must form the basis for any rationalisation, are, however, found to be completely out of date, and as a first measure a census of all vehicles and tyres is to be made. This cannot be completed before the 5th November. However, Major Quinall, of the M.E.S.C., Jerusalem, is now in Tehran investigating the road transport position for the purpose of achieving a stricter control of all motor vehicles and the removal of non-essential vehicles from the roads. With this control it is hoped that adequate supplies for essential motor transport can be arranged. This, with the increased use of animal transport that is taking place, permits, so I am advised, a cautious optimism about the future. Polish Refugees. 19. A second evacuation of military and civilian Poles from Russia occurred in August. 26,000 civilian Poles are for the moment in the Tehran area. Fortunately, arrangements have been made for the 10,000 previously here to go to East Africa and all will shortly have left Tehran. Meanwhile, in spite of the provision of special imports of wheat, tea and sugar by M.E.S.C., the addition of so many Europeans to the population of Tehran has given rise to some misgivings among Persians, and the Persian Government is most anxious to get rid of all Polish refugees. The British military authorities are equally anxious to eliminate this responsibility here, and it is hoped that the efforts now being made to find a destination overseas for them will shortly be successful. 20. This in no way exhausts the list of issues outstanding with the Persian Government. Little progress has been made with the complicated question of the payment for the arms already taken over by the British and Soviet Govern ments from the Persian authorities and the acquisition of certain other arms urgently needed by the British forces. Numerous points still await settlement in connexion with goods required by the British military authorities, and this question is bound to become more important now that the Allied forces in Persia are to be increased to meet the change in the war situation. Further, the Prime Minister has recently been requested to hand over to the R.A.F. all the accommodation at Mehrabad Aerodrome, which is the last training establishment in the possession of the Persian air force in the neighbourhood of Tehran. It will be necessary to tackle these problems one by one, and I am hopeful that it may be possible to reach satisfactory settlements. Attitude of Persians towards the War. 21. Most of the difficulties which have arisen this summer in our relations with the Persian Government are fundamentally traceable to a lack of confidence on the part of the Persians that the Allies would be able to win the war, or even (to bring matters nearer home) to keep the Germans out of Persia. The most obvious sign of this was perhaps their recent suggestion in London and Moscow that Tehran should be declared an open city. It is highly satisfactory that this impracticable suggestion has been rejected, as the only real incentive to start/i/c:j | m^j 5 some serious A.R.P. organisation would have disappeared, while our military plans would have been wrecked by the necessity to evacuate military establish ments and aerodromes in Tehran. This lack of confidence shows itself, too. in less direct ways. Persian politicians and officials do not like to be associated with the arrest of Axis sympathisers and agents, presumably thinking that by some complacency towards Axis activities they will not be irretrievably compromised if the Germans reach this country. Similarly, the unwillingness i the Persian Government to hold the large quantities of sterling paid in return for the rials used by our military authorities may be traceable to a fear that they will not, in the end, be able to use the sterling to import goods. Difficulties over the food supply are largely due to the fact that landowners and peasants and even local officials are calculating to some extent on greater military and economic difficulties in the Middle East, and are holding out for famine prices. This lack of confidence has even found expression in the press. One or two Tehran newspapers have published commentaries on the war in Russia which could hardly have been bettered by German propagandists. Hostile articles on the subject of the arrests of suspects have also appeared. The Prime Minister has, I am glad to say, taken firm action by reminding the press of the powers which the Government holds under the Military Governorship Law of 1911. and by suppressing a number of newspapers which over-stepped the limit. He has stood up firmly to the Deputies, and he has told his colleagues that they can resign if they will not do what is necessary as regards the purchase of rials with sterling and the arrest of suspects. He has shown considerable courage in giving a lead to his countrymen, and the same can be said of the Shah. Mr. Churchill's Visit. 22. The visit of Mr. Winston Churchill to Tehran, on his way to and from Russia, undoubtedly had a profound effect on the Persian Government in increasing confidence in the Allied cause. Mr. Churchill saw both the Shah and the Persian Prime Minister on the 12th August, and his personality had a tonic effect on all those to whom he talked. I cannot exaggerate the effect of such visits from leading personalities from the Allied side in flattering and encouraging the Persians. Mr. Wendell Willkie has also recently passed (through, and fiis visit, too, has been an unqualified success. His clear statement that it is time for the friends of the Allies to stand up and be counted and that, in effect, Persia could not go on hoping to get something for nothing, was a timely hint and has had a most useful reaction, however disappointing the results may have been for the Persian Government. It would have been difficult for a British statesman in present circumstances to say the same with equal effect. Anglo-A merican Co-operation in Persia. 23. Qawam es Saltaneh has adopted as one of the planks of his policy closer co-operation with America. This is, I think, in every way an advantage from the Allied point of view. We are unable at the present time to produce a considerable number of first-class advisers ourselves, and, if we did. Russian suspicions might well be aroused. Persians are in many ways more open to approach from the American than from the British side. They are afraid of Powers who are neighbours of Persia and always suspect ulterior intentions. The Americans represent for them the virtues of the Anglo-Saxon nations without any of the disadvantages. From time to time I have detected a certain tendency on the part of the Persian Government to play us off against the Americans here, and it was curious that Qawam es Saltaneh showed himself genuinely surprised when I told him recently that we were in favour of an American military mission if it could be arranged and had so informed the State Department some months ago. Although the present American Minister sometimes, unwittingly I am sure, does not attempt to discourage such an idea in the Persian mind, the close relations between the British and American Legations and between the British authorities and the American advisers who are now beginning to arrive have so far prevented any misunderstandings. It is all-important to keep closely in step with the Americans, since an increase of American influence is taking place here as the American advisers arrive and take up their duties in the various ministries, and as more and more American technicians come to superintend and assist the transport of goods to Russia. So far as this legation is concerned every possible step will continue to be taken to work in the closest co-operation both with them and with the Soviet Embassy and authorities.6 Internal Policy of the Government. 24. The Prime Minister certainly hopes that, with the aid of the American^ advisers, he will be able to achieve a far-reaching reform of the internal administration of the country. Only one or two have as yet arrived, but, meanwhile, the Prime Minister has shown considerable energy in tackling certain internal problems. In the first place he has set up a new inspectorate, the duti^ of which will be to examine all cases of complaints, especially of bribery extortion made against Government servants throughout the country. This seems a step in the right direction, though it is as yet too early to say whether the new office will be able to check the wide-spread corruption which pervades the whole of the governmental machinery. The second reform is a series of changes in the Ministry of Health. The new Minister, Dr. Mareban, has drastically cut down the budgets of a number of hospitals in Tehran, and issued orders that a considerable number of official doctors in Tehran should leave the capital for provincial posts or else be dismissed. The doctors who are personally affected are. of course, indignant, and stories of one doctor being posted to Kerman while his wife, also a doctor, is sent to Hamadan lead one to suppose that the new scheme has not been efficiently worked out; but most people consider that the reform was badly needed and was a step in the right direction. 25. It is difficult to estimate the popular reactions to these innovations and to the new Cabinet in general. There has been some criticism of the engaagement of American advisers and there is a certain amount of opposition to the presence of any foreigners in the Administration, but all sensible Persians deplore the existing state of affairs and recognise the need for reform. The general public is said to be pleased with the Prime Minister’s strict instructions that Govern ment servants are not to break the fast of Ramzan in public; this step, which is a definite break from the Pahlevi tradition, has, on the other hand, inevitably given rise to apprehensions lest the forces of reaction should gather strength and lead to the reintroduction of the veil for women and the renewal of the power of the mullas. The Prime Minister’s broadcast on the anniversary of the Shah’s accession on the 16th September (see my telegram No. 1204 of the 20th September) has had a good effect on public confidence : he appealed to the public to keep out of politics and to have confidence that he would take all possible measures to ensure food supplies and security. 26. The result of the Mukhtari trial, i.e., a series of sentences of imprison ment on various dire charges, about which I shall address to you a separate report, has just been announced, but seems to have attracted little attention; those who think about it at all being divided into two classes : those who think that Mukhtari should have been executed, and those who think that the faults of the late Shah should not have been visited on any of his slavish subordinates. It is convenient that the public has lost interest; meanwhile, appeal proceedings are being started. Conclusion. 27. To conclude this rather lengthy review, I venture to state that it is reasonable to hope for an improvement in the situation as compared with the confusion of the summer months, provided always that no serious deterioration in the military situation occurs. We have had very considerable difficulties with Qawam-es-Saltaneh, but we cannot hope for complete subservience from any man with sufficient character to govern this most intractable and venal country, and Qawam has at any rate now discovered that, where our essential military interests are concerned, we mean business and shall judge him by his attitude towards them. 28.

(No. 270.) V y 1 ^ r ’ , Tehran, August 14, 1942. / /frc u ITH reference to my telegrams describing the day-to-day development of the recent Cabinet crisis here, ending in my telegrams Nos. IPO S^nd 1004, I have the honour to inform you that the fall of All Soheily ’s Cabinet on the 30th July came as a surprise to many observers. I propose in this despatch to attempt to analyse the reasons for Soheily’s resignation, as well as to describe shortly the political events which followed it, culminating in Ahmad Qawam’s presentation of his new Cabinet to the Shah and the Majlis on the 9th August. 2. The ex-Prime Minister, in his farewell statement to the Majlis, a summary^) of which I enclose hereinv^attributed his resignation to the lack of sympathy shown by the Majlis and the press to his Government’s efforts to deal with current problems. There is no doubt that a number of Deputies, chief among whom were Ali Dashti, Saham-us-Sultan Bayat and Dr. Malik-Zadeh, were opposed to Soheily and did their best to make difficulties for him. Their explanation of their conduct was that Soheily, in order to obtain their support, had made a number of promises to them which he did not fulfil; for instance, he had promised to award the post of Minister of the Interior to Farajullah Bahramy (Dabir-A’zam), but had not kept his promise. Bayat was openly working for the post of Prime Minister, and Dr. Malik-Zadeh was hoping for a lucrative appointment in the university. Soheily was forced by the Majlis to attend endless secret sessions in person, after which the same subjects were often discussed in public without any regard for any decisions that may have been taken in secret session. To many observers Soheily appeared to be afraid of the Majlis. Nevertheless, the public, such as it is, seems to have recognised that the Majlis were unreasonably obstructive, and there has been much criticism of the Deputies. 3. As for the press, there were certainly a number of attacks on various members of the Cabinet and on the Cabinet’s policy as a whole in certain Tehran newspapers, and an attempt to control the press by a new law evoked so much opposition that Soheily felt obliged to abandon the struggle. Certain Majlis Deputies were of the opinion that, if he had been courageous enough to use the powers which were already at the disposal of the Government in virtue of the state of military law which still exists at Tehran, he could have checked this irrespon sible criticism without recourse to new legislation. But, most important of all, there was much criticism of the Government for failing to deal adequately with the question of food distribution. Adequate powers had, admittedly after much delay, been given to Government by the Majlis, but nothing effective had been done to check hoarding, and the occasion, if not the cause, of the crisis ending in the downfall of the Government was rioting in towns such as Malayir and Burujird, where the new harvest is already available, and there was no excuse for bread shortage. It is only fair to add that there are some grounds for believing that the riots were not spontaneous. But it is an undoubted fact that the Government were unwilling to deal with hoarders, and many people hinted darkly that prominent officials, and even Ministers, were in the racket themselves. The Government certainly did little, if anything, to suppress the widespread corruption of the country, and there were a number of scandalous rumours about financial and moral irregularities committed by the Prime Minister himself. 4. The unfortunate incident of M. Aliy’s appointment as ambassador to the Soviet Union may also have helped to undermine Soheily’s self-confidence. When Mohammad Saed Maragha’i was brought from Kuibyshev to take over the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, it appears that Aliy’s appointment to replace him was decided by the Shah, Soheily and the Soviet Ambassador without any formal notification to Ahy, the result being that the latter became annoyed, hinted that he would not go, and finally resigned from the Cabinet three days [33-10] Not printed. ECo- r L&gt; Mb rS | Cid-r n B ‘J | «]( U.'k f+LkcaJ. Orx 2 before Soheilv gave up his task. M. Ahy had a certain capacity for making trouble, though he enjoys no great prestige in the Majlis, and his intrigues added to Soheily’s difficulties. 5. But the most effective factor which caused Soheily to resign was probably his feeling that he had lost the confidence both of the Russians and of ourselves. The Soviet Ambassador complained to Soheily, I understand, on the 28th July that his Government had failed to deal with the food, transport and. ^ fifth column problems. At that time Soheily was proposing to remodel his' ' Cabinet by introducing some new members, but finally decided to resign altogether. It may have been that my own action in informing him on the 29th July that we were greatly disappointed by the failure of the Government to deal with the wheat situation was the deciding factor. The Minister of the Interior had been to Khuzistan to settle the wheat question there, but had failed completely to extract any but the smallest quantities of wheat from landowners known to have many hundreds of tons to spare. The labourers working for the British military authorities and the towns of Ahwaz and Khorramshahr were meanwhile going short. The Prime Minister knew quite well that we were gravely concerned at this ineffective handling of the situation in an area where our interests were closely affected. Further, we were pressing for the arrest and handing over to us of a number of Germans and Persians implicated in the evidence obtained by the British military authorities from a number of Germans in their custody. The knowledge that this demand could not indefinitely be put off may have decided him to resign before an unpopular decision had to be taken. 6. After his resignation Soheily, at the Shah’s request, carried on the functions of Government for three days. During that time the Majlis sent delegates to the well-known elder statesman, Hussein Pirnia (Mu’tamih-ul- Mulk), asking him to form a new Cabinet, but Pirnia told them in no uncertain terms that he refused to take office with such an intriguing and obstinate Majlis. On the 1st August a ballot of the Majlis gave 53 votes to Qawam against 22 to Soheily, and the former agreed to form a Cabinet on the under standing that he was to have a completely free hand in the selection of his Ministers. He proved willing, if not anxious, to discuss this question with us, and cancelled several names immediately he heard that we did not approve of them. His Cabinet as presented to the Majlis on the 9th August contains four satisfactory members of the previous Cabinet (Said, Hajhir, Azodi and Hussein Adi); two old gentlemen (Hakim-ul-Mulk and Mustashar-ud-Dowleh) in an advisory capacity; an active new Minister of Education, Siasi; a benevolent old oculist (Ismail Marzuban) as Minister of Health; and the energetic Kazemy as Minister of the Interior. Hamid Sayyad. the new Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, has occupied that appointment recently to our satisfaction and is acceptable to the Russians. The selection of Ali Reza Gharagozlou (Baha-ul- Mulk) for the Ministry of Justice is a surprise, as the new Minister has not held office for a long time and cannot know very much about the details of the Ministry to which he is appointed; but he has the reputation of being an honest, well-meaning man. The Ministry of War was at first offered to M. Ala, who preferred to retain his non-political post as general manager of the Banque Mellie, and then to Kazemy, who refused it as too difficult; the Prime Minister himself is therefore looking after that Ministry; and Taghi-Zadeh’s Ministry, that of Finance, is also in the Prime Minister’s charge pending Taghi-Zadeh’s reply. It is also proposed to appoint a Minister or Controller of Food with wide powers, and I hear that Amanullah Ardelan (Haji Izz-ul-Mamalik) is to be given that post; he has formerly had ministerial rank, though he has recently served in provincial appointment, such as Governor-General at Kerman, at Rezaieh and at Isfahan. 7.

'ytfj/ n\ ms aespatcn i\o. oi mo zisi uunc i\±i. xxuiinan gave a general review^ / fryViJi* of the events of the past three months and of the situation in Persia. Subsequent^ ff'l tc SVL fayflL a. ix,. events, I regret to say, Shave demonstrated only too clearly that the situation here „ cannot be separated altogether from the fortunes of war. 1 he German successes in South Russia and in Libya have inevitably affected public opinion and encouraged a tendency to sit on the fejice, which enemy propaganda has certainly increased. 2. Early in June it became apparent that an enemy propaganda drive was being conducted in Persia, and reports also came in of enemy agents passing through Turkey into Persia via Kurdistan. Our attention was drawn at the same time to a series of accidents, some serious, some slight, which were taking place at the ports and on the Trans-Iranian railway, some of which could only be attributed to sabotage. On the 20th June Mr. Holman made three requests to the Prime Minister : (a) That visas to enter and leave Persia should only be granted fV J after reference to this legation—in practice to the .representative of Cici; (b) that the proclamation making Axis propaganda illegal should be made more specific by laying down the precise penalties which infraction of it would entail; and {c) that eighteen persons suspected on good grounds of Axis activities should be handed over to us for interrogation and, in fact, detention. 3. The Prime Minister granted the first request without demur; and arrangements have also been made to control the issue of transit visas via Iraq. Nevertheless, the frontiers of Persia cannot possibly be closed to all unwanted travellers, and we must certainly expect that enemy agents will continue to travel with relatively little hindrance from Turkey through the disturbed areas of Kurdistan into the interior of Persia. 4. The second request also, regarding the proclamation on Axis activities and propaganda, was granted, though there may well be loopholes in the articles of the penal and military codes now referred to as applying to infractions of the proclamation, by which a clever person could elude punishment. Although Axis propaganda continues and has undoubtedly increased, the means to combat it should now exist if only the Persian Government can be induced to take the necessary action against any offenders caught. 5. The third request, for eighteen suspects to be handed over for interroga tion, has, as you are aware, been met by the Prime Minister with a request that interrogation should not take place at Ahwaz. The idea of being sent to Ahwaz in summer is, to a Persian, peculiarly horrible, but until recently 10th Army have felt unable to arrange for detention and interrogation elsewdiere. It is now hoped to arrange a camp at Kermanshah for the purpose, but the Prime Minister is most unwilling to hand over any more Persians to us, and has, in fact, gone back on a promise he made to hand over eleven of the eighteen on the 25th July. His selection of the eleven was itself designed to obviate trouble for himself and to create it for us; the eleven were either persons of no importance, or else men connected with the army whose arrest would tend to arouse yet more anti-British feeling in that on the whole distinctly pro-Axis force. 6. A demand for the handing over of Persians in Persia to the British military authorities is a very far reaching one. But it is unfortunately all too clear that no other solution offers the smallest security that the detained persons will be properly isolated. Of the first six most notorious Axis sympathisers arrested last April, several were sent to Yezd to be kept under close surveillance, but were, in fact, left at liberty; and one, Yasiri, escaped and has been at large near Isfahan ever since in spite of frequent representations. In deference to our representations they were then sent to Kermanshah to be kept under joint guard: but this was also very unsatisfactory, and subsequently all were sent to Ahwaz for internment by the British military authorities. We shall be more r Av&lt; Ry iSc^r 4 [32- *54]likely to get further suspects handed over if such suspects are,kept by us at Kermanshah or some other town where the climate is less hot. 7. There are undoubtedly many Persians who would be glad to see the Germans come and put an end to the presence of Russian and British troops on Persian soil. This feeling is to be attributed partly to the not unreasonable nationalism, partly to a widespread belief that the Allies are responsible for the^^ present regime of short supplies of bread, sugar, piece-goods and other necessaries^ coupled with very high prices. Our energetic propaganda is not without effect, but without an Allied victory now and then at some point nearer to Persia than Midway Island, to offset the traditional suspicion of Great Britain and Russia, 4 ,\t has a heavy task. We cannot at present hope to make the Allies popular, but we must try to make the espousal of the Axis cause dangerous, even at the risk of driving the movement underground. It is believed' that as the Germans j ^approach nearer to Persia, some of the more sensible of those who have hitherto sighed for their coming begin to have doubts; but it would be dangerous to regard , this as a very important factor in our favour, though there are many Persians Iwho do not wish their country to become a battlefield or to be turned into scorched earth. 8. The question which has undoubtedly worried Persian opinion most in . the last two months is whether there will not shortly be another famine here as in the last war. Already in the winter 1940 and the following spring there was a wheat shortage which, although relieved by imports from India, left Persia with no reserves. Our entry into the country just when last year’s harvest operations were in full swing led to the collapse of Government authority, especially in the main producing areas, and little effort was consequently made to collect the share of the wheat crop on which the Government usually relies for the feeding of the capital and principal towns. Stocks were pillaged and either eaten or secreted by peasants, while the rich clung to what they might require and speculated with what they did not. Those near the western frontier took advantage of the high prices in Iraq and Turkey to smuggle their ill-gotten gains and any other surplus grain they might have across the border. The Persian Government, urged to tackle seriously the problem of hoarded stocks by the simple method of raising prices, have obstinately refused to try this obvious expedient for fear of its effect on their future policy and on the economic life of the country as a whole. They have been content to let matters take their course, to blame the Russians for not letting the wheat surplus in Azerbaijan find its normal market in Tehran, and to rely on His Majesty's Government to make up the wheat deficit by imports frorn abroad. This we have done to the tune of over 70,000 tons or one-fifth of the whole of the Persian Government’s requirements for the year. 9. These imports have now come to an end; the new harvest is being reaped, and henceforth the Persian Government must stand on their own feet. The prospect is not encouraging. The Government price for the new crop has indeed been raised to about £12 a ton, which is apparently the price current in India, but though in some districts, notably those in East Persia, the new prices are considered adequate, in others further concessions will be necessary if the farmers are to be induced willingly to surrender their surplus. These the Government are unwilling to grant as they consider the prices are fair and that they will be • able to collect the proprietors' surplus, if necessary, by the use of force. After much delay the Government has secured from the Majlis wide powers to proceed against hoarding, w^hich is the logical result of their attitude as regards price; but so far practically nothing has been done to exercise these powers except for a few local raids, notably in Khuzistan. 10. The consular liaison officer scheme which has been separately reported and which is now being put into execution as and when officers become available was devised to assist the Persian Government in their efforts; but difficulties in getting officers to operate the scheme before the crops have all been harvested must seriously prejudice the chances of its success. The next two months will show whether the moral influence which is all that we can at present exercise in this enormous and most difficult problem is sufficient to overcome to a sufficient degree the lethargy and corruption of Persian officialdom. The scales are certainly loaded heavily against us, but we are doing our best. 11. The general uncertainty and uneasiness of the general public concerning the food supply has been reflected in a series of anti-Government intrigues in the Majlis. At about the beginning of July the opposition of the Adalat party, headed by a Sheikh Ali Dashti, became prominent, and was said by the party to be based on two things : first, the vacillation of the Prime Minister, who had3 promised a number of Deputies certain favours which he never performed; and secondly, by the weakness of the Government resulting in its inability to solve the transport and the food-supply problem. One of the members of the Adalat party, Farajullah Bahrami, had been practically selected as Minister of the Interior, but on the 2nd July everyone was surprised to hear that Seyyid Mehdi harrukh, Governor-General of Kerman, had been appointed to that Ministry. ! his appointment angered a number of Deputies, including some who were not members of the Adalat party, and also the Deputies from Kerman who had quarrelled with Farrukh. Meanwhile, rumours of a quarrel between Sdheily and his Minister of Justice, Ahy, concerning the latter’s departure as ambassador to the Soviet Union helped to spread the general feeling that the Cabinet was on its last legs. The number of candidates for the post of Prime Minister was considerable. A group of Deputies proposed Mustafa Quli Bayat (Saham us Sultan) as their candidate, but with little hope of success as Bayat has had little experience in Government Office and would not command general respect. Another group supported Ali Mansour, who was Prime Minister at the time of the occupation last August and is now Governor-General at Meshed. Tadayyun was also active, and went so far as to sound the Soviet Embassy as to their views on his candidature; according to his own story the answer was that he was too pro-British, but the Soviet Ambassador made no comment when I subsequently spoke to him about Tadayyun as a possible candidate for ministerial office. Qawam es Saltaneh (Ahmed Qawam) was perhaps the most serious candidate, and there is no doubt that he had a considerable following, moreover, the Russians appear to regard him as strong enough to ensure a stable Government. Bagher Kazemy is also on the prowl In conversation with the Oriental Secretary on the 7th July he made a bitter personal attack on Soheily, accused him of neglecting to tackle the vital problems of the country, and advocated an immediate change of Government; one of his suggestions was that a Senate, on the lines laid down in the Constitution, should at last be formed, or that at any rate a number of eminent though aged elder statesmen, such as Mu’tamin ul Mulk, Hakim ul Mulk and Mustashar ed Douleh, should be taken into the Government as ministers without portfolio in order to give the Government that authority which is so lacking in the present Administration. Finally, there is Seyyid Zia ed Din labatabai, whom some Tehran politicians still regard as the one person who can save the country from its present ills; one suggestion being that Qawam es Saltaneh should form a Government to prepare the way for the Seyyid’s drastic purge. 12. It was feared that when Seyyid Mehdi Farrukh was introduced to the Majlis as the new Minister of the Interior there might be an interpellation which would unseat Soheily. That, however, did not happen; the explanation being, perhaps, that I was expected back in Tehran soon, and the word had gone out that nothing drastic should be done until the British Minister arrived. Since my arrival on the 13th July the Majlis crisis seems to have simmered down, for reasons which are not very clear. One reason may be that there are so many rival candidates and proposals. Soheily is no doubt playing one “ party ” in the Majlis against another; and he seems to be giving in to the general clamour against the unpopular Press Bill which would severely limit the freedom of the Tehran newspaper-writers. It may also be that the Majlis Deputies are themselves feeling a little insecure; talk of dissolution is in the air, and Dr. Malekzadeh, a senior Deputy, expressed to one of my staff his horror at the rumour which had reached him to the effect that Soheily had asked the Soviet Ambassador whether the latter thought the Majlis ought to be dissolved; Dr. Malekzadeh’s point being pot that the Majlis elections could not be reheld, but that it was wrong for a Prime Minister to discuss such a step with a foreign Power. The position, as I write, is that Soheily appears to be eontemplatino- a reshuffle of Government posts, with the introduction of some new men. When Ahy goes to Moscow, Soheily may bring in Tadayyun iji his place; though Ahy shows little sign of preparing himself for departure, a fact which may be the source of the rumour that he hopes himself to secure the premiership one of these days. Meanwhile, rumours of a military coup sponsored by a few prominent generals tend to increase the prevalent uneasiness. 13. By and large it may be said that Soheily has only survived because no obvious successor was available, and that being so, neither the Shah nor the Russian Embassy nor this legation wished to bring about a change. Meanwhile the Deputies have earned much popular disapproval by their obstruction and irresponsibility, and the Majlis might well have been dissolved had it not been [32-54] b24 V, % m for the rather unexpected opposition of the Russian Ambassador, who said the moment was inopportune.” . ^ 110 ^ eas y to assess precisely what is the extent of Russian influence in I ^ rsia present. The Shah told Mr. Holman early in July that he appre ciated the way we made our influence felt, because we did not absolutely insist on certain appointments being made as some others did. Whether he was. refen ing to the appointment of the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, who wa pieviously ambassador in Moscow, I do not know. But if this was so, both Peisians and Russians were very discreet about the negotiations. Our own method, viz., not to ask for the appointment of particular officials, but to prevent the appointment of very bad officials and occasionally to demur at the removal of gCKxi ones, seems to be better than the method attributed to the Russians. 15. Generally speaking I doubt whether the Russians exert much influence ovei the affaiis of the Central (government at present. They are alleged to support the Fuda party, but, in spite of some allegations to the contrary, they do not seem to carry on any serious internal political activity either in Tehran, or, for that matter, in the zone where Russian troops are stationed, though they do seem to show, or to have shown, some favour to the Kurds. His Majesty’s Consul- General at Tabriz has suggested, and I agree, that they seem to be following a somewhat hand-to-mouth policy and are solely interested in the war with Germany. Their economic activities are greatly hampered by a lack of rials and they have allowed the British military authorities to make up the road from Tehran to Qazvin and on to Tabriz. They will only allow small quantities of the excess of cereals in North Persia to come south and east, where it is badly- needed, and are also taking cattle and horses away into Russia, but as there is a most difficult food situation in bouth Russia that is hardly surprising Thev have allowed I eisian troops to return to Rezaieh, but they treat them with great suspicion indeed, the Persians are like prisoners, and* the conditions of the return to Tabriz are, I believe, not yet settled. Nevertheless, the situation is certainly a little easier. I 16 ' Relations between ourselves and the Russians have gone through a most f difficult stage, owing to the dispute regarding the use of the four aerodromes in the .Tehran aiea. At Qaleh Murghi aerodrome we had built a cement runway and installed D/F facilities, but the Russians claimed its exclusive use for the reception of American bombers. The dispute ended in an agreement signed between the R A F. and the Soviet Transportation Administration in Persia, on the 30th June, by which the Russians will administer Qaleh MurMii and we will administer the others, each granting the other rights of use as required. 17. iV not her source of tension was an incident on the 30th May when a British military reconnaissance party, finding a road impassable in North Kurdistan, turned without previous notification and went through the Soviet zone. Fortunately the Anglo-Soviet Treaty had been signed only a few- days t^t an i^’ 110 °wi n o to that fact and also largely owing to the efforts of Mr. Urquhart, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz, the incident ended m an invitation by the Soviet Commander, General Melnik, to General Quinan i a i 18 ! 1 r ^ a ^ )iaz ; General Melnik w-ould not agree to various measures which iffb Army desired in order to prepare the way for possible military operations m the area, but excellent personal relations were established and General Melnik is to pay a return visit to Bagdad very shortly. 18. Doubtless the Russians will never quite get rid of that suspicion of us w ich is so chaiacteiistic of them, but our relations have certainly been much more cordial since the signature of the Anglo-Soviet alliance. 19. The w-ar is beginning to throw long shadows over Persia. It is strange that this country should have escaped for so long. But now problems are arising with which the ineffably corrupt and inefficient Administration is obviously incompetent to deal. To an increasing degree we are having to interfere in the ^ration of the country. Under the new r C.S.C. system the overseas trade of Persia is planned by the M.E.S.C. in Cairo and controlled from this legation I have already mentioned the constant representations which we have made about hoaiding and the appointment of C.L.O-.s to supervise wheat collection and distribution in the principal areas. In addition we are proposing to take on lease large areas of irrigated land in Khuzistan, of which the Persians have failed to make adequate use, in order to supplement the country’s supplies of wheat and vegetables. Proposals are also on foot for a Food Board and for a Transport Board to put some measure of energy and, if possible, honesty into Persian admimstiation m those spheies under British, Russian and American super vision. It is proposed that British and United States representatives should sit. 5 on these boards, and the required executive energy will, it is hoped, be provided to a large extent by the American advisers. A number of American experts with, it is hoped, executive powers will arrive shortly to help in the administration ot the army, police, finance and supplies and in other spheres. General Greely is already working as unofficial adviser to the Intendent-General of the Army, /^Hd Professor Winsor has been working for some time in the Ministry of Jriculture as irrigation expert. 20. A.R.P. is non-existent here, and a P.A.D. officer from 10th Army has recently conducted an examination of the question on the spot and made recom mendations to the Persian Government. A survey of minerals of value to the Allied war effort is being made by Mr. Barnett, a'member of the M.E.S C staff and development work’under our direction may well result. Meanwhile we do not forget, in the midst of this constructive effort, measures lying at the other end of the scale of usefulness, such as air raid precautions and plans for evacua tion to be put into effect if the worst comes to the worst. 21. In the areas occupied by British troops, our intervention to secure the removal of undesirable officials and the appointment of suitable successors is becommg increasingly frequent. I am reporting separately on the question of the I nbal Lands Commission with which Colonel Galloway maintains special contact. Meanwhile it is only fair to say that in spite of gloomy forecasts the Persian army has succeeded in maintaining a fair degree of security on our lines of communication and supply routes to Russia. Mohamed Rashid in Kurdistan only has a few~ followers left, and rather desultory negotiations are proceeding' In the Bakhtiari country an appearance of order has been restored; only in Pars does the situation cause anxiety as Nasir Khan has not made his peace with the Persian Government and is said to be harbouring some German agents The Qashgai and Kuhgilu countries are closed to Government troops. 22. To conclude this rather lengthy review, there is, I fear, no doubt that we are in for a most difficult time. The food-stuffs and transport situation alone is most complex, and w T e have to work through a maze of corruption and inefficiency in the administration in our efforts to deal with it The deterioration in the military situation in recent weeks has made our task a good deal more difficult. But we shall live from day to day and try to meet these problems as they arise. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. /THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT structure, which is extremely amorphous and confused. I now have the honour to transmit to you herewith a short note prepared by the Oriental Secretary and Miss Lambton on various political parties or groups which have recently come into prominence at Tehran. This is rather more complete than the list enclosed 0 cp in the Military Attache's Summary No. 25 (see my despatch No. 200 of the 23rd June)7 Most of them are of an ephemeral nature, and none of them are really parties in the same sense as the word is used in European countries. The Prime Minister regards them as quite unimportant, and considers that most of their members are merely hoping to secure lucrative posts by means of the political pressure which their party hopes to exercise. A past Minister of Education, Tadayyun, regards them as an instance of history repeating itself : meaning that in the earliest days of the constitutional movement in 1904 and 1905 a large number, amounting to as much as 100 of such ephemeral parties, sprang up. They were known as “ anjumans,” and they all disappeared when the Majlis was bombarded and forcibly closed by the reactionary party. 2. Mr. Trott’s note contains in summary all the information which I have been able to collect, hut the groups are so fluid and liable to change that it may well be that some of the names and details are out of date already. It is also possible that other groups exist which have not yet come to my notice. 3. Only three of the parties mentioned, Adalat, Sa’Adat and Vahdat-i- Mellie, have any representation in the Majlis, where there exists no serious party organisation. There are only a few fractions which are composed of most of the Deputies, but they are almost as fluid as the parties described in the enclosure to this despatch, and have a personal rather than a political basis. The Govern ment is politically inexperienced in handling the Majlis, and appears to have an innate fear of its members. Thus neither local party organisation, which bears no relation to the Majlis “ fractions ” nor personal capacity and experience of Ministers, serve to rescue the Government from its numerous embarrassments due to the irresponsibility of the deputies. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad and His Majesty’s Minister of State, Cairo. Note on the Political Parties and Groups now in Existence in Persia. 1. The ‘‘Tuda (People) party may be described as Socialist and anti- Fascist. It is popularly supposed to be Communist, and certainly shows a movement towards the Left. The controllers of the party deny that they are Communists, but it is hardly possible to doubt that the party, and its organ the newspaper Siyasat, is supported and subsidised by the Soviet Embassy. Its president is Suleiman Mirza, and its most active member, and the editor of its newspaper, is Abbas Iskanderi. Its members fall roughly into two groups, firstly rather theoretical pseudo-Communists and a few Social Democrats, and secondlv a number of place-hunters. The party cultivates a Democratic outlook and July 23, 1942. PERSIA. With the Compliments of the Under Secretary of Stats jy for Foreign Affnirs i ^ ’W' ? ?• Section 2.

It is almost the only party with any semblance of local organisation in the country, mostly in the north, though the organisation is believed to be very sketchy. 2. Most of the rest of the parties seem to have arisen in order to combat the Tuda party. The most important at the moment seems to be the “ Adalat ' (Justice) party, launched by the ex-newspaper proprietor and firebrand editor Sheikh Ali Dashti, supported by a number of Majlis Deputies and others. Its official organ is the newspaper Mehr-i-Iran, edited by Majid Muwaqqar. It poses as Liberal and Progressive, but seems to have achieved its present prominence by securing two or three lucrative appointments for members. It has attempted to form branches at Tabriz and Isfahan. 3. The party presided over by Tadayyun, an ex-Minister of Education and ex-Leader of the Majlis, is known as the “ Midi ’ (National) party. It appears to be the only party which can boast of local headquarters, as it possesses club- rooms where its members meet twice per week. Its programme is Democratic and Constitutional, and it is perhaps less exclusively interested in obtaining office than the other parties. 4. “ Mihan Parastan ” (Lovers of the Fatherland) is the name of another anti-Tuda party, which is said to be one of the strongest. Its members include Dr. Abdul Hassan Sheikh. 5. The ct Paikar ” (War) party is a group of youngish men headed by one Iqbal, a judge, who edits the newspaper Bahar (Spring), which is the party organ. Apart from opposition to the Tuda. they have no clearly defined policy. 6. “ Vahdat-i-Milli ” (National Unity) has recently been started with the blessing of the present Prime Minister as a combined National party with a programme of sound national reform. Internal dissensions soon split it into several parts, and it is doubtful whether it still exists in any real sense. Its members included one Abbas Massoudi, the editor of the Ittild’dt, and Safavi, the editor of the Kushish newspaper. 7. “ Iran-i-Javan(Young Persia), unlike most of the above-mentioned parties, has existed, at any rate in name, for many years, having been sponsored in 1921 by the French Legation. As it at one time included Dr. Musharraf Nafici, Abol Hassan Abtehaj and Mustafa Fateh, it was popularly supposed to be pro-British. It has recently been reorganised with a vague programme of reform, but shows no recent activity. 8. “ Iran ” is one of the names, and “ Sa’Adat” is another, of a party the leading spirits of which are Sheikh Ahmed Behbehani, Dadvar, Moayyad Agmedi, all Majlis Deputies. Their programme is moral regeneration, resistance to dictatorship, encouragement of the small holder and other admirable projects. 9. The poet Mahk-Ush-Shuara Bahar is said to be endeavouring to resuscitate the ancient cc Democratic ” party, which was prominent during the last war. One of the main objects of this party is said to be to support Qawam-es- Sultaneh. 10. Another well-known historical party-name. “ Taraqqi ” (Progress), is appropriated by a group of friends headed by Hakim-ul-Mulk and Zarin Fafsh, who meet once a week and discuss political problems. 11. A secret organisation named the “ Kar ” (Work) party, headed by Lissan Sipihr and organised on the lines of the Freemasons, also exists. Its programme includes free housing schemes for the poor, foreign advisers and longer hours of work. 12. Certain parties in the provinces have been started, such as a group of Azerbaijan Deputies, and an organisation known as “ Mohammadi ” in Tabriz. A group of “ Mullahs ” is said to be forming an £t Islam ” party, but not much progress has been made hitherto. 13. “ Hizb-i-U ” or “ Hisb-i-Shah ” (His party, or the Shah’s party) was started soon after the present Shah’s accession with a vague policy of loyalty to the Shah as saviour of the country. It was probably an attempt by the Shah’s entourage and the military to retain the influence they held under the old regime. Both General Nakhjavan and General Radsar may have been mixed up in it. but popular opposition caused the party to cease outward activity and recently very little has been heard of it.wp PILE THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT UJ L PERSIA.

(No. 197.) 1 ^ - Sir, Tehran, June 21, 1942. ^ t\ r Mi/'r. IT might have been supposed that after the signature of the Anglo-Soviet- Persian Treaty on the 29th January, 1942, the relations between Persia and her s/ ti new Allies would improve in an orderly and peaceful manner. It is regrettable that this has not been the case. Such has been the complete lack of power of decision of the Persian Government and their ill-conceived resistance to the relatively moderate demands which we have made upon them, that in April steps had to be taken to move up British troops in the direction of Tehran in conjunction with the Russians and to let it be inferred that force might have to be employed a second time. In this despatch I have the honour to review and analvse the causes of this state of affairs. 2. Without any doubt the two principal causes were :— (1) British military and naval set-backs at the beginning of the year in Africa and in the Far East, and (2) The continued presence of the Japanese Legation in Tehran. So long as our interests were suffering in the various theatres of war, it was only natural that Axis propaganda and activities should take on a new lease of life here and that Persians, who might otherwise be well disposed towards us, should, assume that old profession of “ fence-sitting. I he flames of anti-British feeling were at the same time fanned by the Japanese Legation, who with their network of financed propaganda and intelligence activities played on the fears and feelings of the public, who were led to believe that all their sufferings,, particularly economic, were due to the Allies. The rupture of relations between Persia and Japan accordingly became one of our primary objectives, on which progress in every other sphere depended. The Anglo-Soviet-Persian 1 reaty could naturally not be quoted in support of any representation to the Persian Government, owing to the fact that Japan was still in diplomatic relations with Russia. It was accordingly urged upon the Persian Government that the closing of the Japanese Legation could reasonably be expected as an earnest of goodwill as between Allies on account of Japan’s unprovoked aggression; that it would not harm Persian interests in Japan or Japanese interests in Persia, both of which were to all practical purposes non-existent; that the continued presence of the Japanese Legation could serve no useful purpose, as all communication facilities had been denied them, and that the Japanese Legation was, in fact, nothing more than a centre from which military intelligence reports were sent to the enemy. Indeed, the Japanese were suspected of using a secret wireless transmitter, and their agents were known to be distributing large sums of money and quantities of subversive literature. 3. I need not recount at length the history of the long and repeated representations to the Persian Government begun early in February. Suffice it to say that no progress could be achieved with this question for about two months. It was necessary to use every possible form of inducement and pressure. The United States Government were persuaded to make the grant of lease-lend facilities for the Persian Government and the provision of expert advisers dependent on the rupture of relations between Persia and Japan. The Soviet Government agreed to inform the Persian Government that the\ had no objection to their breaking off relations with Japan. His Majesty’s Legation collected all evidence from secret and other sources to prove that the Japanese Legation were indulging in undiplomatic and subversive activities and this information was communicated to the Persian authorities. linally. the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister and His Majesty the Shah himself were warned in no uncertain terms that the situation would seriously deteriorate, unless early satisfaction were received. - %■2 \ \ &lt;A 4. Notwithstanding these I'epresentations, every conceivable form of prevarication was indulged in by the Persian Government to keep the Japanese Legation, which they probably regarded as their last re-insurance link with the Axis. The question was even discussed at a secret session of the Majlis, where, according to the Prime Minister, members were strongly in favour of the main^ tenance of relations with Japan. But the patience of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom was exhausted. In Foreign Office telegram No. 506, of the 12th April, to Kuibyshev, it was explained that His Majesty’s Government had decided to concentrate troops outside Tehran to be able to occupy the capital, if necessary, and enforce the closing of the Japanese Legation. It was arranged that Sir Reade^ Bullard would then demand an immediate audience with the Shah and insist on the rupture of relations with Japan. The Soviet Ambassador in London had been informed of our intention and told that, if British forces were eventually obliged to occupy Tehran, and if the situation should so develop as to render other measures necessary, the Soviet Government might wish to be associated in the occupation of the capital. His Majesty’s Government would welcome such a decision. The Persian Government, however, sensing, no doubt, that His Majesty’s Government had made up their minds to take forceful action, finally gave up the unequal struggle and on the 12th April instructed the Japanese Minister to leave Persia with his staff in one week. Eventually the legation left Tehran on the 23rd April. 5. Meanwhile, there existed other acute causes for dissatisfaction with the Persian Government : — (a) It was proving increasingly difficult to obtain sufficient rial currency in exchange for sterling to finance the expenditure of the British military authorities on road, rail and aerodrome developments in Persia. The statutory limit of the note-issue had been reached and the Persian Government were unwilling or unable to persuade the Majlis to increase it. Yet clearly the work of developing communications with Russia had to proceed. (b) No effective measures had been taken by the Persian Government to stop Axis propaganda or even to make it illegal. {c) For weeks His Majesty’s Legation had been demanding, without success, the internment of the six most notorious Persian pro-Axis propagandists. 6. It appeared to His Majesty’s Minister desirable to clear the air by insisting at once that all these eminently reasonable desiderata should be met and should be included in representations to the Shah, backed by the threat of force, and that, if possible, similar action should be taken by the Russians. In Foreign Office telegram No. 527 it was agreed that Sir R. Bullard should seek an audience with the Shah, but that, if satisfaction had been obtained over the departure of the Japanese Legation by then, less drastic representations should be made. 7. The audience eventually took place on the 22nd April. It was apparent that the movements of Russian and British troops which had taken place, and the warnings which had been previously delivered, had been reported to His Majesty, who was evidently aware of the possibility of the strongest action by His Majesty's Government. The Shah expressed the keenest desire for the settle ment of the currency question. Further, as the result of repeated and insistent representations, a proclamation, making enemy propaganda illegal, had been issued and published in the press. Similarly, satisfaction had also been given that very morning over the arrest of most of the six Axis supporters; it was. therefore, unnecessary for His Majesty’s Minister to utter any direct threat. The negotiations on the financial issue actually culminated on the 26th May in the signature of a financial agreement which should settle the question of rial requirements for the duration of the war. 8. This episode certainly had the desired effect of clearing the atmosphere, and since then considerable progress has been made in almost all respects with the Persian Government, though insistence and much wrangling has frequently been required. Axis sympathisers have not generally been dealt with satisfactorily, and His Majesty’s Legation have had to arrange themselves for their internment, first at Kermanshah and later at Ahwaz. Thanks, however, to the general co operative attitude of the Persian police, under pressure from His Majesty s Legation, many suspects, including Germans, have been arrested, both in Tehran3 and in the provinces, and the task of the fifth column, for the time being, may have been rendered somewhat more hazardous. We still have, however, a long and difficult road to travel before we can say that it no longer constitutes a real ifc^nenace. Enemy propaganda has, during the period under review, to some extent / .ibeen driven underground, though it still exists in strength and is likely to show its head again, whenever the war situation becomes unfavourable for the Allies. At the present moment there is a noticeable recrudescence of Axis activities here which have, no doubt, been staged to coincide with German military operations -in Libya and Russia. The Berlin and Rome broadcasts are, fortunately, jammed and the Prime Minister attributes much of the easing of his own position to this fact. As the result of further representations by His Majesty's Minister the local authorities have been instructed to allow all public broadcasting sets to be only used for listening to Allied broadcasts, including those organised nightly from the Tehran station by the Public Relations Bureau of this legation.. This, of course, is of distinct advantage to the Allied cause. 9. The noteworthy increase in co-operation on the part of the Persian Government since the April crisis has also shown itself in a number of subsequent issues. For instance, the tribal situation has given considerable cause for anxiety . 1 owing to the ineptitude of the Persian civil and military authorities. It has no longer been possible for His Majesty’s Legation to adopt an attitude of complete detachment regarding internal affairs in the tribal areas which lie athwart the supply route to Russia and the British lines of communications. Largely as the result of repeated representations by His Majesty's Minister, the Prime Minister had made, on the 31st March, a declaration to the Majlis promising to remedy genuine injustices and grievances of tribesmen and setting up a commission for their investigation. The declaration was couched in vague terms and it seemed unlikely to create the desired effect in tribal areas. With your concurrence. His Majesty’s Minister, in May, pressed the Prime Minister to make his offer a reality and offered to place our good offices at the disposal of the Persian Govern ment, in areas where our interests might be affected, in connexion with land grievances. The Prime Minister readily consented to His Majesty’s Legation being furnished with any information which might be required from records in the possession of the Persian Government. The Government of India very kindly placed at the disposal of this legation the services of Colonel Galloway, Political Adviser at Sultanabad, and of Colonel Fletcher, Political Adviser at Kermanshah. for the purpose of investigating tribal grievances, and Colonel Galloway has for the last month been working here as liaison officer with the Tribal Lands Commission at the Ministry of Justice. He has received a very satisfactory degree of co-operation. Members of the legation have also visited Kurdistan to investigate tribal complaints. 10. Meanwhile, the Persian army has, fortunately, shown itself less incapable of dealing with tribal disturbances than was feared. An armed revolt in Khorassan by Yusuf Hezara'i (Saulat-us-Saltaneld was suppressed by Persian troops. In Kurdistan the situation is at present well in hand. In the south the situation is fairly satisfactory for the time being, but potential trouble-makers have not yet been challenged by the Persian forces. The Persian army is, however, a source of considerable preoccupation in view of its known Axis i i , sympathisers. In any case, it cannot be expected that so soon after the events of last September it would rally to our cause. It is possible that under the influence of the Shah it may become better disposed, but I feel that it is up to us to try and quicken the pace by assisting it as far as may be possible with its military requirements, particularly transport, and in compensating it fully for such military equipment as we have removed or purchased in the past. The arrival of an American Mission should also improve the situation. 11. In the economic sphere, too, it has been found necessary for this legation to interfere more and more in the internal affairs of Persia. It is impossible for His Majesty's Government to continue to import large quantities of wheat into the country, and steps have accordingly had to be taken to encourage greater local production and to ensure the proper distribution of wheat, whether grown locally or imported. It has required repeated and insistent representations to .. get the Anti-Hoarding Law put into effect; and it has now become essential to | strengthen consular staffs by the appointment of special consular liaison officers ■ to watch wheat distribution and check hoarding in the provinces. 1 his scheme * should be in operation shortly. Meanwhile it is a sign of the times that it has [31—35] b 2been welcomed by the Persian Government. The wheat and internal transport issuer are at present, however, far from a satisfactory solution. It is impossible to say as yet whether the Anti-Hoarding Law will he effectively administered, an m spite of all our efforts, the increased production and proper distribution or wheat are still problematical. t M uc .b the same considerations apply to Persia’s foreign trade in general In order to bring Persia within the framework of the Middle East Supply Centre ei smn imports must be licensed and the licences related to quotas approved by the Middle Last Supply Centre. The machinery necessary to bring this about is now beginning to operate, and it means in effect that the Commercial Section of tins legation will direct and control the whole overseas trade of Persia except be seen tbat a considerable degree of co-operation on the part of the Persian Government has been achieved in every sphere, political, economic and financial. I attribute this partly to the idea which may at last be spreading nere that the chances of a final Axis victory are receding, partly to the rather stronger policy which is being adopted by His Majesty’s Government towards I ersia, and partly to the directive given by the Shah to the Government to co-operate as closely as possible with His Majesty’s Legation. Personally, in the last few weeks I have found the Prime Minister generally ready to give as much satisfaction as he can on any questions which I raise with him. 14. A most impressive encouragement to this improvement in our relations was given by the visit of His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester to Tehran fjom the 10th to the 13th May. His Majesty’s Minister has reported separately on the results of the visit, and I would only record here that it greatly confirmed the friendly feelings of His Majesty the Shah, who often repeats that he decided when he came to the throne, definitely to adopt a policy of co-operation with the Allies, and that it profoundly flattered the Persian Government and people at a most opportune moment. ‘ r 1 15. Our relations with the Court might be better, were it not for the Queen-Mother, who is bitterly anti-British and makes things most difficult for the second ex-Queen, Ismat Pahlevi. How far the Queen-Mother’s influence extends over the Shah I am unable to say, but my private relations with His Majesty are of the closest and in my private conversations with him he is completely frank and seems to be only too pleased to unburden his heart with full confidence. M hat he needs, 1 am sure, is an experienced adviser around him, with political sense and no axe to grind, whom he can completely trust. At present he seems to suffer from a feeling of isolation. 16. To turn to the internal political situation, the Government of M Soheily was at first far from satisfactory. Soon after he had taken office it became clear that he was as incapable as his predecessors of obtaining swift decisions on matters of vital interest to us. The question of finding a better Prime Minister was taken up with the Foreign Office, but it was decided that for the moment no moie suitable candidate was available, and he was, therefore, allowed to stay This was a happy decision, as from the preceding paragraphs it will be evident that co-operation with the Prime Minister has considerably improved. He mav not be an ideal Prime Minister and may be more untrustworthy and corrupt than most, but his retention for the time being probably serves our purpose. 17. The obstructionist tactics of the Majlis have, however, not decreased. The question of dissolving that somewhat absurd institution and proceeding to new elections has been discussed with the Foreign Office. Dissolution, of course, has the advantage of accelerating the Government’s business and preventing the Prime Minister from using the Majlis as an excuse for procrastination, 'it is possible that with the temporary disappearance of the Majlis co-operation between His Majesty s Government and the Persian Government mi^ht be [improved. It has, however, been considered preferable that the pace should’not be forced, at least pending the ratification of the recently signed Financial Agree ment and the appointment of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and of the Interior. 18. The trial of the ex-Chief of Police, Mukhtari, is proceeding and seems likely to reveal a good deal of scandal concerning events which were much better buried. The accused is being given the benefit of counsel to defend him. Applica tion has accordingly been made by the counsel for the production of certain dossiers connected with the ex-Shah’s part in the murders for which Mukhtari is accused. The application had to be referred to the Palace, as the dossiers wereIN kept there. The Shah's secretary recommended that they should not be produced, but the Minister of Court, Feroughi, is said to have advised the Shah that the course of justice should not be interrupted, an opinion which may cause His Majesty a good deal of embarrassment. ,, , 19. A former Governor of Khorassan, named Pakravan, has recently been i rested and is to be tried on similar charges, as he was Governor of the province an the ex-Shah’s reign at the time of the massacres in the shrine and ol ic execution of the keeper of the shrine, Asadi. In view of the number of people who suffered under the regime of Shah Reza, some head-hunting seems almost inevitable, though we shall do our best to see that our interests are not adverse y affected 20. To sum up, it would be idle to suppose that the Persian Government or people have turned, or could turn, pro-Ally overnight. 1 heir principal reaction to every event is based on fear and self-interest. If the Germans appeared to be advancing towards Persia successfully, the attitude of the 1 ersian Government would of course, change for the worse. But for the present the going is better than might be expected. The Persians have discovered again that we mean business. They have also discovered that, if our main desiderata are gianted, they are treated with decency and consideration and do not suffer the fate of countries under Axis domination. 2 i Throughout the negotiations for the departure of the Japanese Legation this legation preserved an outward attitude of cordiality and never sought to humiliate the Persian Government or the Shah. Phis has, I think, been duly appreciated, and for once has not been misconstrued as weakness. 22. In general, the period of co-operation during the last four weeks must be exploited to the maximum possible extent. There is a vast field to be covered, as will be seen from the preceding paragraphs. The better we can cover it, the better we shall be able to face trouble if the military situation m Russia deteriorates during the summer, and the better we shall be able, if all remains normal to lay a sound basis for close and friendly relations with Persia.
