I AM directed by Secretary fen E Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo respecting the right of the Oil Syndicate to construct a telegraph and telephone along the pipe line which they are about to construct from their oil wells in Arabistan. I am to inform yon that His Majesty’s Government are doubtful whether it would he to the interest of the Syndicate to raise this (Question with the Persian Government at the present moment, but that if they desire to proceed with the work on their own responsibility His Majesty’s Government will, if necessary, use their good offices in support of the Syndicate’s contention that Article 2 of their Concession entitles them to build a telegraph and telephone line along the pipe line for use only in the ordinary course of their business. I am to^ add that Sir E. Grey is obliged to the Syndicate for their offer to allow the use of their poles by the Indo-European Department for the service of the Borasjoon- Ahwaz-Mohammerah and Shuster line, but he does not consider that any such arrange ment would be practicable. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) LOUIS MALLET.

The “short distance ” referred to at the Ahwaz end would be of no significance, but at Mohammerah the line would be on the opposite side of the river from the town, and to carry the wire across the river, which would necessitate a wide span at a sufficient height to clear the river steamers’ masts, would probably involve some trouble and expense. It is, however, well that Government should know what is being talked of. . . . . 4. The general question of telegraph communication is becoming more and more important, and the failure of the Persian line proportionately injurious. The line between here and Mohammerah has now been continuously out of work since November, while the line to Borazjun, which gives communication with the rest of Persia and Europe, has only been working on the 25th December and the 3rd January since my return here on the 17th December. .As the operations of the Syndicate increase, the necessity for direct means of communication with Europe and the inconvenience of its absence are steadily growing. If circumstances are adapted to the employment of this form of argument, might it not be possible to press the requirement of the Syndicate on the Persian Government jn such a way as to aid the Indo-European Telegraph Department in their negotiations with the Persian Telegraph Department ? _ . 5. The question of the Syndicate’s local requirements should not he referred to m any discussion with the Persian Government. They seem fairly entitled to build a telegraph line in immediate connection with their work and their doing so will probably not be questioned. Put were the matter to he forced on the notice of the Persian Government, or any statement made which could be misconstrued into a request for permission to build such a line, the Persian Government would doubtless, following its best traditions, become obstructive—witness the removal of the rocks m the Karun at Kut Abdullah.

I have just time before the post goes to send you the following extract from a letter received from Reynolds of the Oil Syndicate, dated 7th June: “ In respect of ground probably required by the Syndicate for Tankage, etc., I should presume on Abadan Island, I have suggested that the good offices of Maior Cox at Bushire be solicited in this matter, and in anticipation of instructions I would do myself the pleasure of calling on him at Bushire when m route home, but fear he will have left. You - ight kindly mention to him on this land question, in writing to him demi-officially. “ My idea would be to ask him to instruct the Imperial Bank of Persia, Bushire, in the matter, without our appearing at all^unless it were necessary to fall back on the rights conferred by tne Concession.” It seems rather a funny role to ask the Bank to play as though on their own account, as no one could possibly imagine that they could want land on Abadan Island for their own use, and the meanest capacity would guess rjo-ht the first time as to whom it was really for. I had not previously understood that it was definitely decided by what route oil in case of its being found, should be taken down to the sea. Bandar Dilam was occasionally spoken of as a possibility, though it was rather with a view to preventing Haji Rais counting his chickens before they were hatched. Lieutenant Wilson wrote to me recently urging me to try and obtain permission, or a commission, to go down Bandar information in general, and in particular to examine the neighbour o d om Ihe pTnl of view of rtie Syndicate’s possible requirements. He proposed starting in September. n • + ? Unless Ranking is sent back now, such an early start would interfere with the fulfilment of the purposes for which he stays on.

The idea that the land can be acquired in such a wav as to honri™; i the Sheikh as to the identity of the real purchaser is of course puerife and absurd. It would liaye been so in any case, as no one but the SyndirafB could possibly be purchasers, and the Sheikh would never sell unless he knew fnr what purpose the land was wanted, and had assurance that the Persian Go™™ ment would raise no objection. To make doubly sure, however, they bunded the secrecy of the despatch of an Agent from Burma to examine the ground^ There is not the slightest doubt that the Sheikh and Haji Rais are ea^erlv awaiting the opening of negotiations. ^ erl ^ The Syndicate’s requirements are public knowledge, and it has only been possible to introduce an element of doubt as to whether they will establish their export base at Muhammerah or, say, at Bandar Dilam. establish ru 1 \ ■ Rais are ’ 1 am sure y° u will agree with me 1 4 o e uM t °hp e n dlffiCU t and P rotracted ’ it seems very desirable that they should be commenced as soon as possible, before the material for the 2 line arrives and the work has to be begun. 1 the pl P e 5.

You may recollect that I addressed you at the instance of Mr. Reynolds on the same matter in a demi-official letter dated 8 th July last, in which I ex pressed the opinion that the ruse suggested would be futile, as no one could possibly imagine that the Bank could want land in Abadan Island for their own use. I still remain of that opinion. Mr. Reynolds is being persistently pressed by his Principals, I understand, on the necessity of carrying out the negotiations without the name of the Syndicate coming into them. Personally I cannot imagine that the Sheikh will ever consent to sell blind fold. 2 . I retain a signed copy of Mr. Reynolds’ letter to the Bank for refer ence; should you desire it I will send it to you and obtain another. Dated the 22ud February 1909. From—G. B. Reynolds, Esq., To—The Imperial Bank of Persia, Bushire. I have the honour to state that I hold instructions from my Principals to acquire land on Abadan Island, immediately south of Mohum’ra, and they ex press themselves that it possibly may be acquired for them cheaper by their name not appearing in the transaction in the first instance, hut that a third person acquire it and subsequently hand it over to them. I am not aware if this be feasible, but should it be thought worth trying, I would ask you to please be so good as to appear as the purchasers, acting, sub rosd, as our Agents in the matter. I note that Major Cox. Political Resident at Bushire, has particulars of the land, I having handed to the Consul here a plan of same, and it is wished to purchase it outright. Bailing to acquire it in this way, we shall have to obtain possession under the Concession under which we are working, and my Principals think that this may be the more costly method. Should then Major Cox deem the purchase through your good selves feasible, he will communicate with you and you will please take his instructions as though it were from me in this matter. Regretting the trouble I am giving you. No. 55-138, dated the 4th March 1909. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of correspondence ending with my telegram No. 5-9, dated the 1st March 1909, I have the honour to forward, enclosed, in original, a letter which I have received from Mr. Reynolds, the Concession Syndicate Manager. Dated the 3rd March 1909. From—G. B. Reynolds, Esq., To—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz. In reference to my letter to you of 14th February last, on the subject of the acquisition of land on Abadan Island for the Refinery, I note that, byPB MPrM •dManaiM 8 the post which has this day arrived, I have a wire from my Principals to the effect that the Foreign Office have requested Major Cox to render us assis tance in this matter. They further add that Messrs. The Imperial Bank of Persia express themselves as unable to appear as purchasers and suggest Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. should he asked to do so. Under these circumstances I now write to ask you to please be so good as to advise Major Cox of this, and that he kindly ask Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. to appear in this capacity for us. You will please also tell Major Cox that I am unavoidably called away from this, and that it were impossible that I get back here before 22 nd current, and if he has anything to communicate to me, I will be obliged if he will kindly write to me on the subject, and if he wishes me to meet him at Mohum’ra, I will be in a position to start from this, I hope, on 25th current, Begretting the trouble I am giving you.

Lorimer, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz. Please see your official letter No. 55-138, dated the 4th March, and the previous demi-official correspondence which arrived during my absence. I am sorry that I was not able to put you in possession of a reply from Mr. Reynolds before he left on March 3rd. Will you please let him know that I have as yet received no communication from the Foreign Office or the Government of India in the direction expected. In the meanwhile, kindly explain to him that negotiations of the “ benami ” nature adumbrated, even were it expedient that I should be identified with them, would certainly he quite futile. The Sheikh is on the qui vive and would be quick enough to discern the body of the ostrich however deeply the bird’s head were buried. I think the Syndicate must face the necessity of negotiating frankly with the Sheikh, relying on their representative’s adroitness and our diplomatic assistance when the time comes, to secure terms as near fair market rates as possible. In such critical times as the present it may be taken for granted that the Sheikh is primd facie oniy too glad that the British Government should create concrete vested interests in bis territory,! and this instinct of self-preservation should tend to make him reasonable in regard to the matter in hand, hut as a matter of fact before any negotiations can commence, it will no doubt be con sidered necessary to make sure that the Sheikh has the right to sell land at all on Abadan. It may prove that he can do no more than lease it. I do not think any object will he served by my speaking to Messrs. Gray Paul until I receive some instructions from Government, but I will keep you posted in this regard for Mr. Reynolds’ information. Secretai S. G. P. L— No. 4059 F. p.—27-3-1909—48.—J.

I am directed t&gt;y Secretary Sir E.Grey to trans mit to you, to te laid before the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a letter from the Concessions Syndicate expressing a wish to erect a telephone line along the pipe line which is to he built from their Oil Wells to their Refinery. It appears to Sir E.Grey that it is unnecessary to approach the Persian Government in regard to the matter, but he would be glad to be favoured with Viscount Morley’s views on the subject before any de cision is arrived at.

Sir :** I am instructed by the Oil Syndicate to bring the fol lowing to your notice and ask you to be good enough to af ford us your kind assistance. For the due development of the Oil discovered in Arab- istan it is necessary to build a pipe line from the Wells to the Refinery. For the proper maintenance of this pipe line a telephone line is absolutely essential. The pipe line has to be inspected daily along its whole length, so that any leakages or breaks may at once be discovered, and with a minimum amount of delay information be given to the pump ing station to stop pumping. To enable this to be done a telephone line is necessary. Article II of the Concession which gives the right to make the pipe line, concludes as follows ’'It shall also comprise the right of constructing and “maintaining all and any wells, reservoirs, stations and “pump services accumulation services and distribution ser- unc ' e r Secretary of State. Foreign Office.- r;' 'services workshops and other works of arrangement that 'may be ne ce saary H . The Syndicate contend that the words M and other works of arrangement that may be necessary’ 1 give them the right to build a telegraph and telephone line at the same time as they build the pipe line without further reference to the Persian Government, they being absolutely an adjunct to the other and without the telephone the maintenance of the pipe line would be an impossibility . The Syndicate would be obliged by your advising them on this point and if you are of the same opinion, would give them your support. If not, and you deem it necessary that .the Persian Government be moved for the necessary per mission to erect these lines and if there is no objection to such a course, would you most kindly alio?/ His Majesty’s Legation to arrange the matter in Teheran for the Syndicate. I understand that an arrangement is under consideration for the Indo-European Telegraph Department to put in order and maintain the lines of the Persian Government from Eorasjoon to Ahwaz and thence to Mohammerah and Shuster &amp;cthe Syndi cate would have no objection to allowing the use of their poles!■ - ■■■ M 1 W “fTin IKSkViJMI nrnmmm poles lor a ?;ire to be used for the above service as far as they could be utilised by the Department.

I have informed Captain Lorimer unofficially that I am forwarding his letter to the Government of India, and that no doubt if they think there is anything in Mr. Reynolds’ proposal they will take action. I also pointed out that Mr. Reynolds is in error in thinking that the Indo-European Telegraph Company have anything to do with the matter, and that if the Directors of the Concessions Syndicate wish to approach anyone in London on the subject, they had better address themselves to the India Office or to the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. 3. The constant failure of telegraphic communication with Ahwaz is a serious obstacle to British trade, and the nuisance becomes aggravated the more British interests increase there. I am asking His Majesty’s Minister if he can see his way to press the requirements of the Syndicate on the Persian Government as suggested in paragraph 4 of Captain Lorimer’s letter.

A., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter recently addressed by Mr. G. B. Reynolds, local Manager for the Concessions Syndicate, Limited, to his Principals, on the subject of the means of telegraphic communication which will become necessary in connection with the construction and maintenance of a Pipe Line from the Oil Works to the Coast* 2. I am not sure that I quite follow Mr. Reynolds* drift, but it would of course be quite impossible for the Indo-European Telegraph Department to enter into combination with the Syndicate in regard to the stretch of line between Ahwaz and Mohammerab, unless they had previously brought to a successful conclusion their negotiations with the Persian Telegraph Department for taking over the management of the line between Mohammerah, Ahwaz, and Borasjun. 3. With regard to the question of alignment, it is doubtful in any case whether the Indo-European Telegraph Department would be ready to accept that required by the Syndicate. The “ short distance ” referred to at the Ahwaz end would be of no signi ficance, hut at Mohammerah the line would be on the opposite side of the river from the town, and to carry the wire across the river, which would necessitate a wide span at a sufficient height to clear the River Steamers* masts, would probably involve some trouble and expense. It is, however, well that Government should know what is being talked of. 4. The general question of telegraph communication is becoming more and more important, and the failure of the Persian line proportionately injuri ous.

The question of the Syndicate’s local requirements should not be referred to in any discussion with the Persian Government. They seem fairly entitled to build a telegraph line in immediate connection with their work and their doing so will probably not be questioned. But were the matter to be forced on the notice of the Persian Government or any statement made which could be misconstrued into a request for permission to build / such a line, the Persian Government would doubtless, following its best traditions, become obstructive, witness the removal of the rocks in the Karun at Kut Abdullah.

If the Indo-European Company took over the line this to Mohum’ra, the possible connections with their system would seem to be (a) Mohum’ra to Fao, (b) Ahwaz to Eorasjun, (c) Ahwaz to Isfahan. As regards the first of these (a), I note that the cost of messages to Europe hy Eao Bushire, Isfahan and i'ehran would be heavier than at present when the Persian line Ahwaz, Borasjun, Isfahan and Tehran to Europe is used on account of the cable, Eao to Bushire. Again, if the public used the mute to Europe from th.s via Mohum’ra, Fao, Busreh and Constantinonle though cheaper than the routes via Tehran and that via Bombay, no code messages would be allowed to pass. the point of view, then, of the public, it would be better that the Indo-European reconstructed the line Ahwaz to Borasiun or made a new Ime, Ahwaz to Isfahan, following the route of the caravan road. 5. The object of this letter then is to get you to move in this matter, and if you would put yourselves in communication with Messrs. The Indo- European Directors you would hear their views. Trusting that you will see your way to move in this matter, and that the suggestion of sharing a moiety of the cost of the Ahwaz Mohum’ra section may commend itself to you. You will please look on the use of any poles for our line other than iron as absolutely unsuitable as they will be robbed. 8.0.P.I^-Ko, 8340 F. D.—16.2.1909—32-C, L.

I doubt whether, apart from this, the Syndicate would benefit by conducting the negotiations as proposed.

Notes on Oil in Pusht-i-Kuh by Captain Lorimer, No. 2. X Memorandum on papers sent from the Foreign Office to Mr. D’Arcy, dated 12th September 1908. The first point to be noted is in the letter of Mr. Louis Mallet, No. 30503. I do not at all understand the last paragraph, in which Mr. Mallet says that if tbe Syndicate do not undertake the work (in South-West Persia) “there is every likelihood that the business will be secured and worked by the subjects of a Foreign Power”. I do not see how this is to happen as long as the Persian Government keep their engagements to the Concessionaire (Mr. D’Arcy), By part 1 of the Concession the whole rights of exploitation of oil, etc., are conceded to the Concessionaire for all Persia, but by Art. 6 this concession is withdrawn from the Northern Provinces, viz., Azarbaijan, Ghilan, Mazandaran, Astrabad, and Khorasan. I am quite at a loss to account for Jthis paragraph, and can only imagine that it has been written under a misconception. With reference to Captain Lorimer’s communication he, like myself, has but a partial knowledge of the routes into the Pusht-i-Kuh country, but I quite agree with him that the balance of evidence is all in favour of the Ahwaz-Shush (Susa) route, and it would have the additional advantage of assisting another British enterprise which has long been on the tapis. I ^ can also say with knowledge that the route into the Faili Lur country from Dizful would present considerable difficulty for heavy wheeled traffic. It is possible that motors like what is known as the Caterpillar, now being used at Aldershot, might be found useful. After considerable time and large expense of money oil has been found in the Bakhtiari country, and it is but reasonable to suppose that by further prospecting oil may be found at other places in the country of2 ,, t, r-i „ ri5 After much bother and trouble work has been pro- the Bakhtian Khans A„ermu^ for some time .

Lorimer, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz. Being asked to comment on a memorandum emanating from Messrs- Concession Syndicate, Limited, relating to papers sent by the Foreign Office to Mr D’Arcy under date 12th September 1908, including, I gather, my note on the route into Pusht-i-Kuh from the transport point of view, I would ven- ture to offer the following remarks. With regard to paragraph 1 of the memorandum I have no concern. 2. Paragraph £.-~Ihave just now travelled through Pusht-i-Kuh and have visited the sites of the oil springs. I attach herewith a few notes I made on these springs. It will be remarked that the route to one of the springs is entirely without difficulty, after the Karkhah river is crossed, saving such as would be occasioned by having to cross a small river, the Ab-i-Talezi, which mmlit give some trouble at times of flood. The route to the second would neces sitate the preparation of a track for wheeled transport, but the difficulties do not appear to be of a very serious character, and were the oil prospects sumcien y good, I do not imagine for a moment that they would be held to prohibit e undertaking of operations in that quarter. 3. Paragraph 5.—Goes beyond the limits of my original memorandum, and I am obviously quite unqualified to express an opinion as to whether it would be to the Syndicate’s advantage to work in Pusht-i-Kuh or not, hut I wc l ul venture to remark that in my opinion this question should be examined nrst on its commercial merits, that is, on the opinion of an expert as to the worK- ability and quality of the oil in evidence there. I do not think that political considerations should be taken into account by the Syndicate in the first instance. Political difficulties do not, 11 in &gt; exist to a degree which would in the slightest degree justify failure to ascer am what the natural prospects of the oil are. Indeed, I see reason to hope less difficulty would be experienced in working in Pusht-i-Kuh than has e met with in the Bakhtiari country. The same remark holds good m regato difficulties of transport, dealt with in my original memorandum which I now supplement by more detailed information on that subject (vide Koad reports attached). 4 . In the Syndicate’s interests I cannot piss oyer in silence the indica tion given of the relations which it is apparently held are to be regarded as obtaining between us and the Bakhtiari Khans. I would seriously call in question the accuracy of the assertion that the Khans would resent the Svndicate extending its operations beyond their own territory, and were such the case it would be in the Syndicate’s direct interest to disregard it. A knowledge that the Syndicate had a second string to their bow would, in my opinion, add to rather than detract from their title to consideration in the eyes of the Khans. It is difficult in any case to see how the Khans could find a plausible means of exercising any resentment they might harbour, hut should they by any chance learn or suspect that operations were being restricted in deference to their quite indefensible jealousy, they would immediately commence to work on the sense of fear displayed. If fear of the Khans, acknowledged or even only suspected, is going to be one of the articles of faith of the Syndioate, then the sooner they shut down work in the Bakhtiari country the better. The only hope of successfully dealing with persons of the character of the Khans is to display an absolute confidence in exercising one’s full rights, and if fear must exist, in rigorously suppressing the least evidence of it. 5 . As probably my last advice before leaving here, I would implore the Syndicate in their future dealings with the Bakhtiari to eschew all hvpersensitive consideration for their feelings. Such consideration will meet w*ith no return in kind and will be a direct incentive to aggression. The “ good understanding ” which the Syndicate’s memorandum states at present exists between themselves and the Khans has not been arrived at by truckling to their unwarrantable demands or by sacrificing the enjoyment of our rights by studiously avoiding anything at which they might take unwarrantable offence. The records of the last two years will show rather that we have only attained to some degree of peace by maintaining our full legal rights, resenting infringement of them, and in general by protesting by word and action against all forms of injustice as firmly and inflexibly as circumstances made humanly possible. 6 . I would sum up my opinion on the general question as follows :—neither political nor transport difficulties appear to exist which would primdjacie prohibit the successful working of oil in Pusht-i-Kuh, and such being the case it is highly desirable to obtain an expert opinion on the value of the oil supply in that country. , ]s^ 0t 2 . Notes on oil in Pasht-i-Kuh. So far as is known, manifestations of oil occur only in the district of Deh Luran, where it is found at two sites:— # ^ . ( 1 ) 5 miles east of Den Luran Port—two springs of thick bituminous substance. These are situated in a plain gently inclining to the south from the foot of the hills. The hills are a lofty range of yellowish limestone running, say, West-north-west — east-south-east: there is an &lt;f outlier of low limestone hills, running more or less parallel to the general range, and is apparently the remains of the upper strata of the main range which has been removed from higher up. The plain is apparently diluvial and has scattered fragments of limestone from the bills on its surface in places. A line of gypsum hillocks, however, runs along it roughly east and west, and at a distance of one to two miles from the foot of the main range; The sources of the oil lie between this line of gypsum and the low outlying range of limestone; The strata of the latter are steeply inclined and the strike is parallel to the general Ime o: the hills, and they dip at right angles to it, i.e., roughly north and south. To the east, the gypsum increases into a range of hills perpendicular to and running on to the “ outlier ” of the main range. The strata are almost vertical, but lean towards the limestone and appear to rest conformably on it.-4 4 No. 1. The eastern spring of the two (No : 1) is situated about 100 yards from the foot of the “ outlier ” range, near its western end. Water and bitumen issue in small springs in two places about 30 yards apart, and a small stream is formed which flows south-east and loses itself in a dense patch of tall reeds, in which another spring is said to exist. No. 2. The western spring (No. 2), which has no visible connection with No. 1, is situated about | mile south-east of the latter and at about double that distance from the foot of the hills. There is a pool covered with bitumen about 8 yards by 3 yards and a stream of warm water (probably about 80 deg.) issues from a corner of it, carrying shreds of bitumen with it. The pool is formed to seme extent by a dam of stones. ^ There are at first two streams with sulphnrons deposits, which unite a little lower down. Por a distance of about 400 yards, in a straight line, the course of the stream winds through the open plain in a narrow trench 2 feet to 4 feet deep and on its banks at a number of points and also inthe ground in its immediate vicinity, bitumen is seen to ooze up out of the earth. Only two or three of these sources are individually of any size and they are situated on the stream banks. Below this the watercourse passes into a dense patch of reeds from which it does not appear to emerge in the form of a stream of running water. In the course of its progress while still in the open it twice disappears for a distance of about 50 yards under the soil. The bitumen is a thick viscous substance which floats down the surface of the water in snake-like shreds and accumulates when impeded into a dull semi-solid sheet of a consistency rather firmer and more adhesive than molten asphalt. In many places it appears in deposits along the bottom of the bed of the stream. It is collected by running the water into side canals and is removed in its natural state without being burnt. It is noticeable that nowhere is there any large deposit or accumulation of the bitumen, though especially on its upper course the stream seems to be continually bearing it down on its surface. When the water enters the reeds it is comparatively clear. The absence of accumulated bitumen is the more remarkable as it is only occasion ally in the year collected and removed. The flow of bitumen is said to be greater in summer than in winter. It is also said that any quantity can be removed in a day from the upper pool; this can only be the case if the pressure of the bitumen on the surface of the pools interferes with the exit of more bitumen from the ground. Very noticeable and peculiar is the way in which at a distance of a few yards from the stream the bitumen is to be seen oozing up in small patches from the level earth surface of the plain. These patches vary from the size of one’s hand to a square yard or two, and at first sight it seems as if small quantities of the material had been spilt on the ground. The bitumen is collected by Arabs under arrangement with the local owner (Qaid Khani of Deh Luran), and is taken to Amara for shipment to Basreh, where it is supposed to be used in the construction of the pitched wicker work boats of circular shape known as “ gufas ”. These springs are approachable by wheeled traffic from Deh Luran or Saiyid Akbar. (2) Oil Springs in gorge of Ab-i-Talezi. Those springs are situated 4 miles north of Cham-i-Halaku in the bed of the Ab-i-Talezi, which here runs in a gorge from 300 feet to 700 feet deep. This gorge can be approached only from the south-east and from this direction a cart- road could be brought up to its edge over gach hills to a point some hundreds of yards from and 300 feet above the most southerly springs in the river-bed. The west side of the gorge is a perpendicular and impassable cliff nowhere less than about 300 feet high. On the east side of the gorge the approach to the springs is by a stiff ascent followed by a very steep descent of some 700 feet, which is only passable on foot. The preparation of an approach for wheels to the river-bed is thus practically out of the question. The river-bed itself could not be taken as an alignment, as the bed is narrow between perpendicular banks, and5 the volume of water in the stream is at all times considerable, rendering it im passable even on foot when the river is in flood. One of the oil springs is visible from the top of the hill on the edge of the gorge on the left bank mentioned above, 700 feet above river-level. Other springs are said to exist close to it under the left bank, which is apparently perpendicular, and thus conceals them from view from this point. So far as observation was possible the oil would appear to issue from the limestone strata on the east side of the gorge, left bank of river. Fuel appears to be available in suflicient quantity on the upperlheight of the Dinar Kuh and the Kuh Siyah. S. G.P. L— 3339F. D.-11-2-09.— 32—A. D’C.PERSIA-. CONFIDENTIAL.

Charles M. MarlingCamp of 1903. G U L A H E K, July 23th, 1908. Sir:- I have the honour to submit herewith for your information a Memorandum dealing with certain matters which will come up for consideration should the Con cessions Syndicate contemplate extending their opera tions in 8.W.Persia, more particularly in the direc tion of Pusht i Kuh. That this contingency may shortly arise appears to he the opinion of Mr. Reynolds, the Syndicate’s General Manager in Arabistan, as he has privately asked for my opinion on various of the points dealt with in the attached memorandum. 2. As Mr. Reynolds’ present engagement with the Syndicate expires at the end of the current month, it would seem more regular, should it be considered advisable to communicate with the Syndicate on this subject, to do so direct with the Directors. I would Marling, Esq. , C.M.G. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. &gt;mmm nil ' 5 would therefore suggest that, if judged likely to he of use, a copy of the enclosed memorandum should he handed to Mr. D’Arcy. 3. I venture to avail myself of the present occasion to draw attention to the fact that if the route favoured in my note is adopted, it will, on the section from Ahwaz to Shush, some sixty miles, coincide with what is generally regarded as the most suitable alignment for the Ahwaz-Khurramabad-Teheran Road, the concession for which is resting unexploit ed in the hands of the Persian Transport Company. Should the Concessions Syndicate eventually de cide on making use of this route, it might he worth while to ascertain whether the Transport Company would feel disposed to construct this section of the road, which would serve to bring Ahwaz into direct connection with Bizful. This route would be some forty miles shorter than that via Shushter at pres ent in use. 4. The difficulty which interferes with the employment of the shorter route is the permanentstate of insecurity in which it is involved. This condition of affairs would have to he remedied in the interests of the Concessions Syndicate. This fact is an argument of some potence in favour of the Transport Company now undertaking work on this first instalment of their concession. It is true that they would probably secure lit tle return on their capital from native traffic, but this is a general feature of all such enterprise in Persia, and for some years they could presumably count on some income from the Syndicate, unless in deed the latter are exempted from the payment of Road taxes, on which point I am unable to speak from mem ory. The Ahwaz trade with Dizful and the districts fed from the latter, Eastern Pusht i Kuh and South ern Luristan, would also probably undergo some ex pansion. It may also he argued that the fact that the Transport company had taken what action was possible in regard to the Concession, which has been allowed so long to lie fallow, would strengthen our case inairfT .Jbevlovni as rfoirlw ni xcmuooanl lo e^Boa arfcf ni JbsiJbsmen ecf ot 9v/-i binow sniBllB lo nox&lt;tii)noo cfosl airfT . 9 v 4 boI bnyP anoiaasonoO oricf lo aci8e r ;9unx erfci lo tuovb! ni eone^toq emoa lo &amp;nemugJB hb si lanil aiif.ct no 3ftow rinWBvtnebnn won YXtBqmoO faoqanaiT .noiaaeonoo t i eci&amp; lo toemlBoani -&amp;fl anuoea vIcfBcfong Mrjow xertf &amp;Bd&amp; eu%&amp; at &amp;I cfncf illBnl evilen monl InJigBO t i9r r l no cnncien oil ni oai'xqnelno rfotra 11 b lo enulBSl iBnonas b ai airfl vlcfBanasnc; bluoo YA r '&amp; anney onoa nol Jbna t Bi8*ie &lt; I \ -ni aaslm; t o&amp;bo tbny?- Qrfl nionl emooni smoa no Innoo bBofl. lo InemYBq oril moil belqmexs 8 ib nellBl eril beet -mom moil 3 iBeqa ol eloamj m I In l og p r o irfw no ,aexBl aloiilaii) o.n r l bna lulsiCI rfliw abnil SB'v/rfA 9riT .Y r xo -ifluoP Mb ri.LrH i MaM ngelaB^ f /. ellfil aril moil bel -xe enoa 0 ]i9Mij YldBCfoiq obIb blnow ^nalaimJ ms .noianag 9:il iBrfl loel 9 rfl iBiil beugiB ecf os 1 b \^Bm II elcfiaaog bbw noiloB IbiTw ne^nl jberf ynagmoo lioganBiT bQVJoIlB need anrl rfoirfw t noiaaeonor aril ol biB^en ni ni eano mo nsrfl^nsila Mirow , wo 11 b 1 ail ol gnol ospressing on the Persian Government to take effective steps to alter the state of affairs which interferes with the enjoyment of the Concession as a whole. 5. There is said to he a promising 'show” of oil at Qilah, 30 or 40 miles north of Dizful in the Dirakwand country, and should the Syndicate’s opera tions in Pusht i Kuh prove remunerative, a favourable conjunction of affairs, or a development in the pol icy of His Majesty's Government might make it pos sible to negotiate for the throwing open of this Oil field, and at the same time; of the road to Khurrama- bad. The greater the aggregation of our interests in this -quarter, the more possible is it for us to exert pressure on the Persian Government; and the greater the amount of funds available for expenditure in the district, the greater the hope of a less hostile, perhaps even of an obsequious, attitude on the part of the local tribes. ' This latter argument however cannot be regarded as passing beyond the bounds of very dubious conjec ture .6. The establishment of security on the route will entail the provision of policing arrangements, presumably by the Shekh of Muhammerah, and the cost of these will not be inconsiderable, it therefore seems that every possible advantage ought to be taken of the security resulting therefrom. Reference to the introduction of policing measures will recall to your recollection the policy formerly suggested of subsidising the Shekh in return for his protecting ) the routes of Arabistan, which was strongly urged on its own merits, and. as a means of strengthening our relations with the Shekh, by Sir A. Hardinge in a despatch addressed by him to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No.122 dated 1st July 1904. 7. The possibilities with which we have just been dealing would also, if realised, work in very directly with the scheme for the institution of a trade route between Ahwaz and Karmanshah, which has recently been brought on the tapis hy Captain Hawortl) His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Karmanshah, and whichwhich is now under the consideration of Government. (Signed) I have &amp;c., B. L. R. Lorimer, Captain I.A. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice- Consul for Arab i stan.Memorandum on certain considerations rel extension of the operations of the Oil Syndicate in South West Persia. In view of the possibility of the Concessions Syndicate extending its operations to the oil fields in Pusht i Kuh and in other regions in South West Per sia, it may he considered advisable that the following considerations should be put on record for the infor mation of the Syndicate. 2. The locality at which it would seem most prob able that further operations would be initiated is the Deh Luran neighbourhood in the territory of the Wall of Pusht i Kuh. Of the possibility of securing an agreement from the Wall analogous to, and not improb ably more favourable than, the existing agreement with the Bakhtiaris, I entertain little doubt. Accepting this probability, it will be sufficient at present to restrict cur attention to more prelimin ary matters. The question of the transport of materiel to the site at once occurs to mind, and is one of some com plexity. Firstly there is the question of choice of route; Secondly of the protection of that route; and ThirdlyThirdly, that of the means of transport which it would he possible and advisable to employ. 3. With regard to the first of these, the choice available appears to be: (1) the route via Shushter and Dizful, used by existing traffic; (2) an alignment starting from Aminiah (on the right oank of the Karun, opposite Bandar Nasiri) and proceeding up the tract ly ing between the Dix and Karkha Rivers. Both these routes would presumably cross the lat ter river at the spot on the Dizful-Amara route known . as Pa i Pul, some 14 miles to the west of Dizful town. Here according to the season is a ford or ferry, which is to the best of my knowledge favoured by all cara vans which have to negotiate the Karkha in this neigh bourhood. Of the tract beyond this point, which would be common to either of the general routes mentioned above, I have no personal knowledge, and my secondhand information regarding it is neither precise nor exten sive. Prom my experience, however, of the country immediately to the north and nearer the main range of hills, which may be assumed to be more difficult, I wouldTK (s) /t 2 £ ci/i'a r / mQ d0 would not imagine that there should' he any very seri ous obstacles to the construction oi a track suitable for wheeled traffic. From the map it would appear that the Dawairij River and its affluents would have to be crossed in their upper courses, and it is not improbable that in the rainy season these might tem porarily cause inconvenience. 4. The Karkha is a river of considerable volume, and was difficult to ford on horseback a few miles higher up in the month of June. Pa i Pul is undoubt edly a more favourable crossing place, but in winter it is, I understand, always, or generally, only to be crossed by raft. The question of the practicability of a bridge of the swinging pontoon type might merit investigation. 5. To return to the initial portion of the route from Ahv/az, that proceeding via Shushter is open to very serious objections. These objections, in my opinion, may be considered as decisive. I cannot imagine that it would be considered practicable to transport the Syndicate's plant across the Gargar and Shatait Rivers, but of this Mr, Reynolds, the Syndi-?,, M'- • xr Syndicate’s General Manager^ is in a tetter position to form a just opinion than I, and when it comes to deciding on the exact track to he followed numerous minor problems will undoubtedly occur to his mind. In the case of the Diz River, a similar diffi culty presents itself. It is true that this river is spanned by a bridge, but the bridge is only acces sible through the narrow streets of the town, and it is quite unequal to bearing such as the C. S. L’s. re quirements necessitate. 6. Turning to the alternative route, that pass ing up between the courses of the Diz and Karkha riv ers, I am again hampered in expressing an opinion by not having actually travelled over it. This route was, however, traversed, and reported on by Major Bur ton I.A. in the beginning of 1S04; but I have not seen his report. Owing to the insecurity of this tract of coun try, it is practically closed to all but the Arabs inhabiting it, and it is difficult to obtain informa tion regarding its physical aspects sufficiently de finite to be of any value.It may however he considered as certain that the ground throughout is flat alluvial plain, liable to become extremely heavy going in wet weather; that at some point the Shaur, or the two branches into which it divides, would have to be crossed; and that the marshes into which the surplus water of the Shaur finds its way would have to be avoided or negotiated. The course of the Shaur is, I believe, narrow and trench-like, and bridging it and any of the irrigation canals, which might be struck, would not present any serious engineering difficulties. 7. From Shush onwards, to my own knowledge, the land is largely cultivated, and the higher waters of the Shaur might again be found to cross the alignment, as well as the Hurmushi Oanal, which takes off from the Karkha below Pa i Pul. On this section I am of opinion that it would improbably be impossible to avoid having to take up a considerable quantity of cultivated or culturable land in order to obtain a suitable roadway. 8. The question of the possibility of using mo tor, instead of animal, transport has been mooted by Mr.Mr. Reynolds. Being destitute of all technical know ledge of the requirements of motor vehicles^ I do not know what degree of road-tullding would he necessary to enable them to cross the alluvial plains of Arabis- tan, with whose characteristics in wet weather those who have served the Syndicate in Arabistan are suffi ciently well acquainted. For metalling purposes soft sandstone is avail able in a ridge which strikes across the Diz River at Kut Bandar (about 30 m. in a straight line to the South East of Dizful). Similar material is available at Arniniah, and presumably at the A1 Khadhar hills which are just visible from Ahwaz. It is open to fair conjecture that the route af ter crossing the Karkha might be alignable over firm gravel or conglomerate soil, of which the plains ly ing on the Luristan-Arabistan Border, and, to the West, the low hills outside the main Pusht i KUh range appear, so far as my personal observation has extend ed, to be largely composed. 9. Granted the adoption of the route which Ihave just heen discussing, and the employment oi mo tor transport or traffic, it would perhaps he worth while considering, in view of the inevitably high in itial expenditure on motors, and the high rates of freight obtaining on the Karun, whether the head of the road should not be carried back to Muhammerah. In this way the troubles of transhipment and the de lay frequently experienced in the forwarding of heavy material by ship to Ahwaz, would be avoided. 10. I have omitted to advert to the question of water supply. I believe that from Muhammerah to the Karkha at Pa i Pul no difficulty would be encountered in obtaining fresh water at any season. Beyond the Karkha, I know that the supply of fresh water on sev eral stages of the route to Amara is deficient or lacking. I cannot specify the exact stages, but it is rather to be feared that the question might arise in the three stages or so, which lie between the Kar kha and Deh Luran. 11. Passing to the second main question, that of the rendering secure of the route chosen, we are confronted by the real crux of the situation.12 As I have already rejected the alternative pre sented hy the Shushter-Dizful route^ it is unnecessary to refer to that route in this connection^ beyond calling attention to the fact that from Shush onwards to the South route, and from Dizful onwards on the Northern one, the problem of protection is one and the same. Following up the Southern route from its com mencement, the section between Muhammerah and Aminiah presents in normal times no serious dangers. It is equally uncontestable, however, that on occasions when the Bani Turuf are up in arms, or the other tribes of the Hawiza tribe are in agitation, the route here would be liable to the incursions of raiding parties from that quarter. The Shekh of Muhammerah would certainly insist on the necessity of protective arrangements, which would have to be on a scale involving some expendi ture. We could neither deny the necessity nor repu diate our liability for the expense. This expense would have to be balanced against the presumable sav ing on freight.12. The same conditions obtain in a much accen tuated form in the case of the Aminiah-Pa i Pul sec tion, besides passing through the territory of several Arab tribes who have never been habituated to exercise self-restraint when chances of plunder offer them selves. These tribes moreover are inimical to each other, and this circumstance is obviously an addition al menace to security. Further, it may be remarked that these resident tribes are administratively divi ded between the Muhamrnerah Governorship and the Shushter and Dizful districts which are ordinarily combined to form the charge of the Governor of Arabis- tan (so-called ”Shusht er”). Between Shush and Pa 1 Pul the country has a more mixed population, which includes as a rule, among other disturbing elements, a portion of the unruly and internally-divided Sagwand tribe of Lurs. Throughout its course this section is liable to the incursion of non-resident Arab predatory tribes, most of whom having a ready asylum in Turkish terri tory are particularly difficult of control. The only person who is capable of making and maintaining thethe necessary arrangements is the Shekh of Muhammer- ah. Of his ability to do so as far as Shush I enter tain little doubt, but I question his power and will ingness unaided to undertake responsibility beyond that point. The solution of this problem is by no means patent, and cannot be arrived at by any off-hand declaration. A combination between the Shekh and the Wali of Pusht i Kuh is conceivable, and if further strengthened by the goodwill and moral support of the Governor, or Governors, of Arabistan and Luristan, would probably be the most effective instrument for our purposes. There is, under existing circumstances, no rea son, I believe, to call in question the ability of the Wali to extend a sufficient measure of protection to the property and operations of the Syndicate, once within his own borders, i.e. to the West of the Karkha River. 13. It is, however, to be remembered that poli tics and conditions in all this region are very far from stable, and are at all times largely bound up in individual personalities. The death of the Wali wouldwould, for instance/ probably produce a profound ef fect, sucii as would not result in the Bakhtiari Coun try from the demise of half a dozen of the Khans. Though this is the case, the Syndicate should not al low themselves to be discouraged from entering on work on this side, should business considerations jus tify it. With our position in Pusht i Kuh consolidated, and the route as far as Dizful and Pa i Pul rendered secure, it might eventually become possible to contem plate what could be done towards throwing open the Qilab Oil Field to the operations of the Syndicate, but for the meantime this contingency may be consid ered as remote. 14. The third of the main questions detailed in paragraph 2 above, namely the nature of transport which it would be possible to employ, has already been dealt with so far as it is in my competence to do so. Briefly I surmise that from Aminiah to Pa i Pul no obstacle prohibitive to motor traffic would be en countered, but that the construction of a number of culverts or small bridges would probably be necessary. andand that in wet weather the clayey nature of the soil, as in other parts of Arahistan, would constitute a drawback in an unmetalled road* The traversing of the route by the Karkha would probably preclude the establishment of a through motor service from Ahwaz to the site of work; and on the adaptability of the country beyond the Karkha to motor traffic, it is not possible for me at this stage to make a definite pronouncement, though I think that there is little reason for assuming the existence of any prohibitive difficulties. 15. With regard to the possibility of work be ing undertaken at Kai Kaus, Basht, and Zaitun, I have not seen these localities, and cannot offer any in formation of a topographical character about them. The two former would probably present difficul ties from the political point of view, as presumably negotiations with the neighbouring Lur tribes (princi pally Kuhgalu, I believe) would be entailed. At Zaitun difficulties of this sort should not, I think, arise, but this would depend to some extentHUHI [y* ( r* '/ f- b'biA fl- ( 2 (rf ’ u^W ‘W'J No. 2121, dated Bushire, the gth (received 2oth) July 1908 (Cnfidential)i From Captain A.

YJij . ^ llononr to transmit herewith a Memorandum prepared hv Mr. Lorame pointing out the desirability of settling definitely the whole question of Messrs. Lynchs claims against the Bakhtiari Kbans, and suggesting that the present conjuncture may perhaps offer a suitable occasion for the purpose The Memorandum gives so lucid an exposition of the two points at issue-viz., ( 1 ) that Messrs. Lynci are entitled to claim 12 per cent, on arrears instead of 6 per cent.; and (2) that the firm should be recouped the 3,000/. expended in the original construction of the road m excess of the estimate of 5,500/. accepted by the Khans—that further explanation would be useless. But I would venture to express the opinion that, as regards ( 1 ) 12 per cent, is so universally recognized as being the ordinary and moaerate rate of interest in this country, that in reducing the rate to 6 per cent, an excessive regard was shown to the Khans, and one which was probably interpreted as weakness; while as regards ( 2 ) there is little doubt that the estimate of 5 500/. was communicated to the Khans without proper authority having been given by Messrs. Lynch to their agent to quote it as a final and definite figure. Messrs. Lynch would therefore appear to have strong moral grounds for claiming compensation on both, nut more especially on the second of these counts; and the responsibilitv for the loss to the firni lies very close to the door of the Legation. But, without the assistance of His Majesty’s Legation, Messrs. Lynch cannot press their claims against the Khans iiom whom the compensation is perhaps in equity due; and on the other hand the Legation, by its past action, is precluded from taking action except at the price of losing the confidence of the Khans. In these circumstances I submit that the solution suggested by Mr. Loraine, viz.,, that in consideration for the claim for, the higher rate of interest being dropped Messrs. Lynch shall receive the 3,000/. claimed by them under the second heading, the funds to^be supplied from Imperial and Indian sources, is as favourable as can be found, faking the two points on their merits, the proposed compromise might even be judged to be unjust to Messrs. Lynch—it will assuredly he so considered by them; but, on the other hand, they cannot recover from the Khans, and are, indeed, virtually obliged to accept any offer which His Majesty’s Government may see. fit to make them. Some consideration is, however, due to them for the work they have done in opening up the Ahwaz route, but I venture to think that the sacrifice which I suggest that His Majesty’s Government should accept to settle the above claims will fully discharge the debt of gratitude w r e may owe to the firm in question. In this connection I take leave to refer you to Captain Lorimer’s despatches Nos. 672 and 678 of the Hh and 11 th December, 1907, respectively (inclosed in Sir C. Spring-Rice’s despatch No. 10 of the 12 th Lebruary, 1907), in which the former animadverted with some severity on the lack of energy and enterprise displayed by Messrs. Lynch in developing their business in these regions. Similar comments have more than once been made to me of late—notably by the Russian Minister and the Administrator of Customs—which seem to show that the general opinion in Persia is that Messrs. Lynch have failed to make adequate use of their opportunities. It is hardly necessary for me to point out that so long as Messrs. Lynch are in a position to complain that their claims for sums expended are ignored by His Majesty’s Government it is impossible to draw their attention to their short-comings with any force, a course which is most desirable if, in the face of threatening German competition, we are to retain the supremacy of our commercial influence in South-Western Persia. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. [2913 ti—31] M l2 Inclosure in No. 1 . x Memorandum by Mr. Loraine on Messrs. Lynch!s Claims against the Bakhtiari Khans in respect of the Construction of the Ahivaz—Ispahan Road. a AS reported in Mr. Marling’s despatch No. 62 of the 21st March, the Bakhtiari Khans have made a further payment on account of about 12,500 krans against this- claim. There is some reason to hope that, in the present temper of the Khans, the claim (see Mr. Marling’s despatch No. 12 of the 27th January last) will be settled in full. It would not do to count upon such an eventuality, but it is possible, in view of the Khans’ assurances. The moment, therefore, seems not inopportune for raising the whole question of , the Khans’ indebtedness to Messrs. Lynch. Let us suppose that the present claim is fully met. Are we any nearer to a conclusion satisfactory to all parties? It would appear that we are not. Messrs. Lynch are more than likely to refuse a receipt in full, on the grounds that they have abandoned their claim neither to 12 per cent, interest on overdue payments nor to the 3,0001. over and above the estimate given by Mr. Taylor of 5,500/. Should Messrs. Lynch take this line it would place the Legation in an unfortunate position vis-d-vis the Khans, for the claims have been presented with its authority and by a Consular officer. If, therefore, the Khans meet them they will he disagreeably surprised, and with some justice, if they are not given a discharge in full. They will complain to the Legation, and their complaint will be, in equity, unanswerable. It is therefore most desirable that a definite ngreement should he reached with Messrs. Lynch in order to forestall the possibility of a situation such as I have outlined above—a situation w r hich could not fail to react unfavourably upon our general relations with the Chiefs and consequently upon the interests of the Oil Syndicate. Messrs. Lynch’s contentions are, I understand, briefly :— 1. That 12 per cent, is the usual rate in Persia in similar circumstances. This statement, as far as it goes, is perfectly correct, and in the absence of any reference in theii Agreement with the Khans to a rate of interest other than that on capital expenditure they are on fairly strong ground. That the estimate of 5,500/. was a figure mentioned in an unguarded moment hy Mr. Taylor, and one which he was not authorized by his principals to quote (see Persian Transport Company^ to Poreign Office, December 8 , 1904); the Company, t erefore, decline to be committed by his statement. In this case they are technically in a very weak position. His Majesty s Government have decided to disallow the c aim, and the Legation, in its capacity of impartial intermediary between the Company and the Khans, has not been able to press on the latter a claim which they repudiate with some justification. J^kere is, however, no doubt wdiatever that the expense has actually been incurred by the C ompany, and that the 3,000/., plus interest, will have to be written off as a €lear loss unless payment is made from some other quarter. The road has un oubtedly been ot value to British interests, and though His Majesty’s Government can e held by no obligation to indemnify the Company for their loss, to grant compensation, as an act of grace, and as a recognition of the firm’s w r ork as pioneers r^ n n S i ^ te ? prise in a re S ion where the extension of British influence was politically desirable, wmuld create a most favourable impression, and lay the spectre ot a question which may easily prove a fruitful source of friction in the future. -1 am able to state that Captain Lorimer concurs in this view. The situation then appears, from the information available at this Legation, to be that, on the one hand, Messrs. Lynch maintain their claims on the two points to ^ lc | I have alluded ; on the other, that His Majesty’s Government are averse from abandoning their rulings on those two points. . ^ would seem that nothing less than a complete reconsideration of the questions at issue is likely to reconcile the tw r o points of view. j considerations, as I have endeavoured to show above, strongly indicate the desirability of such a reconciliation. • i \ y entare su oo es fj with all due respect, a basis upon which a compromise might be effected :— 11 . Messrs. Lynch to nbandon their chiim to interest at the rate of 12 per cent, on overdue sums. 2 . That the sum of 3,000h he paid to Messrs. Lynch, as an act of grace, from Imperial funds, the British and Indian Governments each contributing a moiety. 3. That Messrs. Lynch, in that case, abandon any claim for Interest on the 3,000/. 1 . That Messis. Lynch undertake to give the Bakhtiari Khans a discharge in full for all fully met claims as made out on the now established basis, and as presented to them by the competent Consular officer, under instructions from this Legation. Tehran, March 22, 1908. (Signed) PEECY L. LOBAINE.PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. No. 1 . Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 11.) (No. 87.) yir, Tehran, April 20, 1908. I HAVE recently received a telegram from Captain Lorimer to the effect that the Bakhtiari Khans have paid compensation for a case of opium, the property of Messrs. Lynch, robbed in 1906, and also the hill of 4,177 krans for the repairs to the bridges on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road in 1907 (see my despatch No. 246 of the 7th November, 1907, last paragraph). The Khans promise a speedy settlement of other claims, with the exception of the bridge repairs hill for 1904, for which they offer 400 tomans. Captain Lorimer has, however, declined to reopen the discussion of this question. Captain Lorimer’s experience has shown that the Khans will eventually pay, if pressed, any claim which they have once accepted in principle, and, seen in this light, the information which I now have the honour to communicate to you appears to me to he eminently satisfactory. I am expressing my cordial thanks to Captain Lorimer for the results achieved by his patient and persistent efforts, and my approval of his attitude in regard to the 1904 bridge hill. I have, &amp;c.

W^ITH reference to your despatch No. 102 , I have the honour to report that I saw Mr. Kitabji on the 29th ultimo, and gave him general instructions in the sense indicated in Mr. Preece’s letter of the 3 rd June. I think M!r. Preece has placed a construction which it was not intended to carry -upon the opinion expressed in my despatch No. 91 of the 26th April last, that the assistance of the Legation should only be invoked as a last resort. Nothing was further from my thoughts than that His Majesty’s Legation should withdraw its interest and attention from the affairs of the oil Syndicate, to the importance of which I am fully alive. My point was rather that direct negotiation between myself and the parties concerned should only be resorted to when all attempts to arrive at a settlement through the usual channels had failed. The Bakhtiari Khans have been given plainly to understand that any representa tions made to them by Captain Lorimer—the principal intermediary in these negotiations—are made with the full support and approval of this Legation, and in view of this fact I feel convinced that Mr. Preece will share my view that the efficacity of the Legation’s direct intervention cannot but he diminished by its too frequent use. I beg to add that I am carefully watching Mr. Kitahji, and that if I am of opinion that his services are not of a value commensurate to the expenditure incurred, I will not fail to inform you.

Sir, Gulahek, July 16, 19077 I VENTURE to express the opinion that the pessimistic view taken in the communication from Sir H. D. Wolff—copy of which was forwarded to me in your despatch No. 96 of the 1st ultimo—respecting the situation of the D’Arcy Oil Syndicate, is not at present j ustified by the circumstances. I will not trouble you with comments on the progress hitherto made with the borings in South-Western Persia, as the Syndicate are themselves doubtless in possession of more recent and accurate information on the subject than is available here. I am, however, informed that up to the end of May no oil had been struck in the borings. The statements contained in the last inclosure in your despatch under reply (which I presume to he from Sir H. D. Wolff) do not appear to me to he borne out by the facts of the case, and I beg to submit the following observations on the dangers which the writer represents as threatening the Syndicate. It is true that the separate Agreement entered into by the concessionnaire and the Bakhtiari Khans has not received the formal recognition of_ the Persian Government. I do not, however, regard this as essential, nor as in any way invalidating the concession granted by the Persian Government. I believe, moreover, that His Majesty’s Govern ment share this view, and would be prepared to resist any attempt to declare the concession invalid on these grounds. The point is a minor one, and any difficulties raised would probably not be very serious : it remains to be seen how far Mr. Kitagji’s influence with the Atabek will prove equal to compassing its removal^ I would further point out that the statement that the concessionnaire was bound by the terms of the Agreement to begin remunerative work within two years of the grant of the concession is not in accordance with the text of that instrument. The stipulation was that the Company was to be formed within that period to exploit the concession (Article XVI), a copy of its Statutes was to be deposited with the Persian Government, after notification of its formation through the Imperial Commissioner, and 20,00(V. was to be paid to that Government, and an additionol 20,000/. in paid-up shares (Articles IX I am unable, after careful search, to find any document recording the fulfilment of these conditions, except as to the payment of the stipulated sum, which was handed over to M. Naus by the Atabek on his dismissal. (See Sir A. Hardinge s despatch No. 149 of the 23rd September, 1903.) The subject is, after all, one that primarily affects the Syndicate, and perhaps it might be advisable to obtain a definite statement from them as to what steps have been taken to comply with the terms of the concession in this respect, upon receipt of which, if necessary, a legal opinion might be invited as to whether the Persian Government have any technical ground for cancelling the concession. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE. [2598/—18]CONFIDENTIAL. The Marquess of Lansdowne to Mr. Grant Duff (Tehran). (No. 87.) (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 28, 1905, 6*10 p.m. • YOUR telegram No. 156 [of 22nd November]. [D’Arcy Oil Concession.] Yon should address note to Persian Government informing them of purport of the Agreement, and asking them to take note of it. If Bakhtiari Khans wish that Agreentent should be registered at Persian Foreign Office, it is for them, as Persian subjects, to move in the matter. Your note should recapitulate Article in D’Arcy Concession which provides for acquisition on easy terms of private rights by the Company. You should state that Bakhtiari Khans claimed that their consent was necessary before Company could engage in operations on their lands, and that the Company, desirous to avoid delays and complications, did not dispute the claim, but settled it on the lines described in the Agreement. They deemed it, however, to be their duty to notify the arrangement to the Government of the Shah, as Sovereign and grantor of the Concession.I am directed 'by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you herewith copy of a letter from Mr. W. K. D'Arcy whose efforts to develop the petroleum industry in Persia have on previous occasions been supported by His Majesty's Govern ment . it will be seen that negotiations are in progress with i the Bakhtiari Chiefs which if successful will enable drill ing operations for oil .to be commenced in the autumn at two sites in the Bakhtiari country. One of these sites Musjid i Suleiman will not be accessible until a road leading to it has been surveyed and constructed. Mr. L'Arcy considers that the survey of this road is a matter of extreme urgency and importance as the heavy ex penses of the work in which he is interested render it essen tial that delay should be minimised as far as possible. fee Under Secretary of State, India Office. I meminent of India for the purposes of this survey the loan of a properly qualified assistant engineer who will he prepared bO start from India with instruments and tents also lent for the purpose as soon as the negotiations with the Chiefs have been brought to a successful conclusion. l*r. L’Arcy states that the Agents in Calcutta of the Burmah Oil Company Messrs. Shaw, Tallace and Company will approach the Government of India on the subject and I am to request that iv.r. secretary Brodrick will, if he sees no ob jection, recommend the Government of India to give the mat ter their favourable consideration. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,I commencement of drilling operations, as such delay would to a certain extent absorb some of the limited money allo cated to this work, and to this end it is very important that the drilling should be started and we hope finished successfully before May next when the hot season commences and work will have to be stopped. Through the great kind ness of Lord Lansdowne, Mr. J.R.Preece, C.M.G., is now in Persia for the purpose of completing some satisfactory agreement with the Baktiari Chiefs whereby we may be en abled to drill on the territory occupied by them, and Mr. Preece anticipates that he may be able to complete such satisfactory agreement with the Baktiari Chiefs by the middle of next month, - October. When this is accomplish ed drilling will be commenced on two sites in the Baktiari territory, the one Chardine, which is fairly easily acces sible from Ahwaz for men, plant and machinery, and the other Musjid-i-Suleiman, which is not by any means accessible un til a road is surveyed and made to it, and it is in connec tion with the difficulty in getting this road surveyed thatI would veiuure to trouble you and to show you what my neces sities are. I cannot do better than quote to you the fol lowing extract from the letter dated 14th. August last of Mr.C.B.Reynolds, our Engineer in charge in Persia:- It Las occurred to me that, without a doubt, if you approached 'the Government of India, asking for the loan of an assistant En gineer who had had some experience in the laying out of roau.s in a Lilly country, and you told them the urgency of tiie situation, they would lend you a man for say a couple of months, and he could lay out the track into Musjid-i- 'Suleiman, while I were occupied with the Stratigraphical 'surveys of the two properties and the general arrangements 'connected with the starting at Chardine and the road in 'there. If this could be arranged beforehand so that on 'sending a wire to you that the arrangement with the Baktiari 'had been concluded, he could be started off at once from 'India, it would be best, and I would suggest that he brought 'his own, i.e. the Government of India instruments etc., and 'his tents so that no delay need be caused on that score.' The Agents in Calcutta of the Burmah Oil Company, Messrs. q hawShaw, Tallace and Company are taking this matter up and will approach the Government of India to see if they would fall in with Mr. Reynolds' suggestion, hut I cannot hut feel that their application or mine, without your kind assistance, will he of very little use in obtaining such a great favour from the Indian Government, and what I would venture to ask of you, if you could possibly see your way, is to write to the Government of India and ask them to favourably consider our request, and if as we anticipate the road can be surveyed early in November next they would, should they accede to our request, be prepared to send a suitable man as soon as we know that hr. Preece f s negotiations make such a survey possible, ana this if accomplished at all will be accomplish ed by the middle of next month and the survey could be made in November. I must repeat my apologies for this my further intru sion on you, and hoping you may see your way to grant my request. I beg to remain, &amp;c., (Signed) W. K.

Mr. Eeynolds researches near Shushter were apparently satisfactory, as ^subsequently called together a meeting of the owners of the land on which the^springs are situated. I hear, however, that he did not find them amenable to his wishes. They demanded a yearly allowance of 150 maunds of oil and 100 maunds of pitch, and a cash sum of Krans 7 , 000 . Mr. Reynolds was prepared to meet them as regards the oil and pitch hut he would not concede an annual money payment of more than Krans 3 000 He went away leaving matters in this posture. Accounts vary as to the precise figures, hut agree in other respects. 3. Malamir and Kila Darabi were visited before Shushter, and, I believe some misunderstanding as to terms occurred with the Samsam-us-Sultaneh. ’ Reference was made by telegraph to the Sipahdar in Tehran and the dispute was adjusted. . 4- As regards the places in Pusht-i-Kuh and Luristan which Mr. Reynolds desired to visit, I received no answer from him to the letter referred to in mv Diary (No. 4). Beyawt (Beyal of the maps), Tumtumab and Deb Luran could, I think, be visited. Indeed, my first intention was to travel to Khurramabad by way of these places. Protection would have to be arranged for with the Amla Karim Khan as regards the road 5 and the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh as regards the places themselves. Native accounts state that there is surface oil in that neighbourhood. 5. The Path-i-Bultan, Chief of the Delfa Lurs, told me that there are springs of good oil near Tarhon in his territory, and said he would like very much that the Exploitation Party, of whom he had heard, should examine them. He would make himself entirely responsible for their safety. This place is, however, right in the middle of the hills. 6 . There is said by natives to be a very large supply of oil at Kilah in the Tala wand-Dirrakwand country. If negotiations for the protection of the pro posed road are carried through successfully, I am hopeful that it would be further possible to arrange for the Exploitation Party to visit Kilab. This is, however, mere conjecture. There is said to be another source of oil above Khurramabad, but I should think that its distance from the coast would prevent its furnishing an export supply. 7. Mr. Reynolds is credited with entertaining a notion of laying a pipe line from Kasr-i-Shirin to Mohammerah. I have difficulty in believing that this could possibly be a commercially practicable scheme. Even if the hill country of the first portion of the route did not present an engineering impossibility, the political difficulties would remain unabated. There would be the tribes of Western^Luristan and Pusht-i-Kuh to be subsidised, ft&gt; !3 rnmfM ffiLland still more formidable, the Arabs of the Arabistan-Osman border—the Ban! Lam, Khasarij, and I should imagine the Bani Taruf and Hawizah tribes. If the Kerkha route were followed, the Pusht-i-Kuh tribes and many of . the Lur tribes of Eastern Luristan, including the Lirrakwand, would have to he satisfied. Jlinute Pa] Letter from From Dizful to Nasiri (Ahwaz) the road and pipe-line might be run to gether under our agreement. Granted time and money, I fancy nothing is impossible, but the expendi ture of both would be great. I would strongly if ayouf the idea suggested {vide Mr. Dobbs’ note, section 6 ) that k a beginning should be made with the nearest oil fields—those of Shushter^Malamir and Deh Luran—if these offer satisfactory prospects. 8 . In the hills]the possibility of working in a smaller way for the Persian market only might be^enquired into. 9. Mr. Wilson (Messrs. Lynch Bros’. Agent here) tells me that he has gathered the impression that the Exploitation Party were:not popular here, or at least that they were looked on somewhat askance by the people. I am not informed whether Mr. Beynolds took any steps to secure the good graces of the Chief Mujtahids. If he did not, it is extremely likely that he was not met with any degree of cordiality. 10.

On the actual boundary line between Persia and Turkey a Persian jmard of honour was waiting to receive men, and at Kala Sabzi, the Persian frontier station I was received by the Sensam-ul-Mamalek, Governor of Kasr Shirin and hereditaW Chief of the Senjabi tribe and escorted to Kasr Shirin, whence T proceeded after! short halt, to Mr. D Arcy s oil wells, about 12 miles north of the town. . 1 was sh nwn over the works on the following day by Mr. Bosenplaenter the engineer m charge, whose guest I was from the 6th to the 8th instant Two wells haie been dug, one to a depth of 1,800 feet, and the other to one of 750 feet The first has yielded oil in only very insignificant quantities, and it is thought unlikely that any will be found in it. The second had already produced, at a depth of 300 feet an encouraging quantity of oil of the very finest and most expensive description followed by two subsequent yields lower down, and Mr. Bosenplaenter was very hopeful that at 200 or 300 feet below the point which he had actually reached, he would obtain it in paying quantities. Since my arrival here I have heard a rumour, which i have not, however, as yet had time to' verify, that his hopes in this respect have been fulfilled. v 1 I was glad to observe that the relations of Mr. Rosenplaenter and of the European engineers and workmen under his orders with the natives of the surrounding district appeared to be satisfactory, for one of the greatest difficulties attendant on Mr. D’Arcv’s enterprise lies in the lawless character of the region in which he has to work The authority of the Persian Government over the Kurdish tribes inhabiting this part of the Province of Kermanshah is very nominal, except when a strong and energetic administrator, such as the late Governor, the Ala-edkDowleh, now promoted to Ears is vigorous enough to assert it, and the real Rulers of the country are the tribal Chiefs, great and small, who are constantly engaged in petty feuds and warfare vuth one another. The most important of them on the Persian side of the border, the hereditary Chie.i. Ox the Senjabis already mentioned (who is, how r ever, I should observe an usurper) has been made by the Persian Government—which here, as amono' 5 the Bakhtiaris and Arabs further south, usually tries to rule through the Heads of tribes and clans— Governor of Kasr Shirin, and has been decorated wuth a Persian title but his effective authority does not extend beyond the actual limits of ins tribe. More over, the whole of the country forming the frontier region between Persia and Turkey is not merely in the condition, for practical purposes, of the old u debatable land ’’ between England and Scotland, but is, except at one or two w r ell ascertained points, such as the boundary on the Bagdad-Tehran Road, “ debatable ” in the literal sense of the term. The late Midhet Pasha, when Wall of Bagdad, erected a series of mud forts in which he placed frontier guards at intervals along what he conceived to be the Turkish boundary line but there are extensive intervening areas, some of them undoubtedly rich in petroleum, the ownership of which is disputed, and over which the rights claimed by Persia cannot practically be asserted owing to the determined opposition of the Turks. Such a political and administrative situation obviously intensifies the inherent lawlessness of the Kurdish clans. They accordingly alternately defy and play off the rival border authorities, whether Turkish or Persian, against one another, and most of their Chiefs resemble in their general habits and conceptions of property and order, the moss trooper in the “ Lay of the Last Minstrel ” who “ five times outlawed had been, by England’s King and Scotland’s Queen.” It is, I think, [1 8.3 G y 3]2 very creditable both to Mr. Reynolds and to Mr. Rosenplaenter that in surroundings of this description they have been able by conduct at once straightforward and tactful to remain on good terms with the turbulent and constantly warring native elements with which they have to deal, and that no single untoward incident of any importance has troubled their relations with them. They have had a good deal of obstruction to complain of on the part of the Turkish authorities who have recently objected to their using a cart road, constructed at Mr. R’Arcy’s own expense, from the oil wells to Khanikinf on the ground that it traversed an unsettled district, and they have frequently been compelled to invoke the assistance of His Majesty’s Resident at Bagdad against petty and frivolous hindrances to the transport of their materials, &amp;c. through Turkish territory. It would be very satisfactory if Mr. D’Arcy could obtain permission from the Turkish Government to take his pipe line through Turkish territory to the Tigris, as the alternative route to Dizful, of a portion of which some preliminary surveys have been made, will entail considerable difficulties and expense. Up to the present, however, the general attitude of the officials of the Vilayet of Bagdad has been unfriendly to the enterprise, perhaps because they hope that its promoters may thus be induced to purchase their goodwill, but partly also because all sorts of absurd rumours have been spread that its objects were mainly political, and that Mr. D’Arcy was erecting fortilied buildings, and distributing, on behalf of the British Government, arms and cartridges among the frontier tribes. Mr. Rosenplaenter complained to me in confidence of the two representatives of the Persian High Commissioner, the Sheikh-ul-Mulk and Mr. Edward Kit ah ji, as giving him more trouble than help. The opinion formed by hie of the Sheikh-ul- Mulk, an ex-“ Akhond,” or religious teacher, from Resht, who was picked up by the late General Kitabji Khan, and who, since a visit to Europe, wears European clothes and drinks wine publicly, resuming, however, his turban, robes, and airs of sanctity when ever any Mollah of importance appears upon the scene, was not favourable. He takes great credit to himself for having persuaded the chief Mujtehids of Kerbela and Kejef to refrain from anathematizing, at the suggestion of certain evil-disposed persons, the enterprise, and all connected with it; but I cannot imagine that a person of his character and antecedents can have any real influence in Persian religious circles, and I fancy he is rather given to fabricating imaginary “fanatical’’ agitations in order to reap rewards in cash, and praise for his supposed success in allaying them. Mr. Edward Kitabji is a man of a much better stamp, and might, I think, do useful'work for Mr. D’Arcy if he were to realise that his interests would not be served by working, as I gather from Mr. Rosenplaenter he has done, with the Sheikh-ul- Mulk. Mr. Churchill, who has a fairly intimate personal acquaintance with him, gave him privately some good advice to this effect. Mr. Reynolds is on a tour of inspection of the oil-fields in Ears and Arabistan. I took him, when at Bushire, to see his Excellency, Ala-ed-Dowleh, and have procured for him letters to the local authorities in both these provinces. The general impression derived by me from the inquiries which I made in the oil belt is to the effect that the pessimism expressed by the Viceroy, as described in your Lordship’s telegram Ko. 113 of the 16th December*, rests on insufficient foundations, and that it would be a great pity to allow Mr. D’Arcy’s Concession to pass into foreign hands before its value has been more exhaustively tested. Its successful working is no doubt a task beyond the energies of a single individual capitalist, but if it should prove impossible to induce an exclusively British Syndicate to take it up, and foreign participation thus becomes inevitable, an effort should, I think, be made to retain a British majority on the Board, and to provide against eventual sale or transfer to an institution, such as the Russ : an Banque d’Escompte here. The latter would, I believe, gladly purchase it without reference to its commercial value, as a means of extending Russian political influence throughout South-Western Persia and Mesopotamia, and removing the main obstacle to the grant by the Persian Government of the pipe-line outlet on the Gulf, which M. de Witte made such efforts to obtain in connection with the loan of 1902. At Kasr Shirin I made the acquaintance of M. Cesari, of Seistan notoriety, who was sent by M. Kaus’ orders to welcome me at the Persian frontier. M. Cesari is a Corsican, not a Belgian, and is apparently made of much the same stuff as the bandits of his native island, beiug a tough and wiry little man, impervious to fatigue and fear, and of an exceedingly combative disposition. His treatment of the pilgrims who traverse the Kermanshah province on their way to the Sacred cities of Irak Arabi has, l am assured, rendered the Belgian Customs Service extremely unpopular, and.indirectly, helped to bring about the agitation against it last summer at Tabreez. It is alleged that ecclesiastics of great dignity and sanctity, on their way from Kerbela and Nejef, who were accustomed under the old regime 'to pass through the customs without any examination, have been subjected to the indignity of a personal search by unbelievers, and that indiscreet hands have even been thrust into the curtains of the j. .Janquins conveying their wives. Much of this is no doubt exaggerated, hut a recent riot at Bisitun, near Kerman- shah, occasioned by the treatment of a passing Mujtehid, nearly cost the local Belgian customs subordinate his life, and I understand that the Chief Priests of Nejef have actually issued a sort of anathema against M. Cesari personally, in which it is declared that any Moslem who shall kill him will perform a meritorious act. He himself spoke to me of the difficulties of his position in connection with the pilgrim traffic, and of the inadequate support which, since the clerical agitation of last year, he has apparently received from Tehran. M. Cesari also referred, in conversation with me, to his disputes with Major Bonn in Seistan, and was anxious to convince me that bis conduct there had not been inspired by any unfriendly or partisan spirit, but I did not discuss the question or encourage him to do so. He asked me to inquire of Mr. Bosenplaenter if ho had not uniformly assisted Mr. H’Arcy’s employes, and afforded the oil enterprise every facility, and Mr. Bosenplaenter, though he avowed that he was not an enthusiastic admirer of M. Cesari’s, admitted that he had no fault to find with him as a customs official. It is fair to add that our Consular Agency at Kermanshah has so far had no complaint to make of M, Cesari. On the other hand, he has been in trouble with the Bussians for pursuing and severely thrashing a party of Bussian pilgrims who had evaded the payment of duty. I stayed two days at Kermanshah on my way from Kasr Shirin to Tehran, and dined one evening with the Pirman Pinna. His Highness said little to me about public affairs in Persia, beyond that he was one of the few Governors who had not received a summons to the capital in connection with the discussion of the proposed financial reforms—a circumstance which he implied, without actually saying so, was due to the jealousy of the Ain-ed-Dowleh. He had apparently become reconciled to the Atabeg-i-Azam just before that Minister’s fall, which was accordingly somewhat of a blow to him. I should wish, whilst on the subject of Kermanshah, to place on record my appreciation of the services rendered to His Majesty's Legation in Persia by Mr. Hyacinth Babino, who has for the greater part of the past year filled the post of pro-Consul in that city. The Pirman Pirma spoke to me of him, as did also the Karguzar, in the most eulogistic terms, and he appears to have won the respect and good-will of all classes of the community. The Beports which he has compiled on the trade, the tribes, and the general condition of the Provinces of Kermanshah and Hamadan, and which I have had the honour to forward to your Lordship, are monuments of industry and research, and together with Mr. Babino’s other qualifica tions, one of which is a thorough knowledge of Persian, point him out as a very suitable person for a Consular appointment in this country, should one be vacant, I am of opinion that, when the next vacancy occurs at Shiraz, it will be better that that post should be filled by the Government of India, and Kermanshah by your Lord- ship’s Department; and should Mr. Babino’s services then still be available, I would recfirfiinend him for the appointment. Indeed, I do not think that it would be possible as it is to obtain a better man for the post, and if it were in your Lordship’s &lt;&gt;iit instead of being one of the Consulates to be filled by Indian officials, I would not’ hesitate, in the interests of the public service, to propose his immediate appomtme^d ^ new j&gt; uss p m Consul, M. Nikolsky, already installed at Kermanshah. He rides about with a suite of six Cossacks, and the Pirman Pirma is, I believe, rather afraid of him; but as he has no interests to look after, beyond the protection of passing Bussian pilgrims, and is, moreover, a man of a fairly quiet and pacific disposition, he has not so far made his influence much felt, at any rate m a sense Prom Kermanshah to Kum I followed the “ Pilgrim Boad ” for the greater part of the way only diverging from it near Sultanabad. The track is an easy one, and as a route from Central Persia via Bagdad to the Gulf presents considerable advantages over that via Pars and Bushire, there being only one ^ fairly steep pass, the Tak-i- Girra, between Kermanshah and Kasr Shirin to set against the four or five far mores formidable { *' kotels,” or mountain ladders, which separate Shiraz from the coast. I traversed it under singularly unfavourable circumstances, the whole country between Kermanshah and Tehran being under pretty deep snow, which so impeded my move ments as to lengthen my journey by a week; but I drove a great part, and could have driven the whole of the distance in a light, open carriage, had I not found it quicker and pleasanter to ride. If ever railways are built in Persia, I believe the lin most likely to repay the cost of its construction would be one from Tehran to Bagdad, (1) because, besides the advantage of a shorter actual distance in mileage, it would present the fewest engineering difficulties; (2) because it would open out more populous and agriculturally richer districts than those traversed by the great southern caravan road to Bushire; and (3) because it would attract a larger traffic both in goods and passengers. If the pilgrim traffic alone is considered, about 100,000 pilgrims pass annually over the Kermanshah route to the shrines of Turkish Arabia, and with railway communication the number would probably be doubled or trebled. I remember, when discussing with the Atabeg-i-Azam the question of railways in Persia, his Highness observing half in jest that if a railway existed from Tehran to Kerbela, no Persians would be buried in their own country. * The importa- tion. of British goods into Central Persia via Bagdad and Kerman shah is bat little inferior in volume and value to that effected via Bushire, so that such a line would be scarcely less beneficial to British trade than one from Bushire, whilst it would be much less expensive to any British capitalists providing the funds for its construction. The Provinces of Kermanshah, Malayer, and Irak, which a railway from Khanikin would traverse, seem, moreover, much richer than those of Ispahan and Pars, and would be still more productive were it not for the lack of markets resulting from the present wretched means of communication. Whilst the great southern road crosses a country largely desert, or at any rate depopulated, I was struck on the Kermanshah route by the constant succession every 3 or 4 miles along the track of villages surrounded by their fields and gardens and by the general indications of cultivation, and of a population denser than that observable in other parts of Persia which I have visited. If it were possible to come to some arrangement with the German promoters ot the Bagdad railway scheme by which, in return for German preponderance on the One as far east as Bagdad, the sections from Bagdad to Khanikin, and from Bagdad via Kerbela and Kejef to Bussorah, should be under British control, and should be worked in connection with a Persian railway from Khanikin to Tehran (with, say a branch line from Kum to Ispahan), I am inclined to think, speaking, of course, from ust impressions, and without a deep study of the question, which would require much more careful examination, that such an arrangement would be to our advantage and would prove remunerative from a commercial as well as from a political pointof view i wou d y however, be a waste of time to do more than touch quite lightly on possibilities which are under existing political conditions too remote to form the subject ot any practical discussion in the immediate present. I should mention before concluding this despatch that at Sultanabad, which I leached on the 22nd instant, I found that the Vezir Afkham, whose exile to the (xor emment of that province (Irak), simultaneously with that of the Vezir Darbar to cl, , e &lt;» report m my despatch No. 81 of the 27th May, 1903, had joined the Shah at kum in November, and had returned in His Majesty’s train to e iian. ^ e wi doubtless ere long obtain, as one of the most prominent opponents or tiie Atabeg-i-Azam, an important position in the new administration. , 1 am y ecl yesterday eyening at Tehran, and have to-day resumed my duties here a er an absence ot exactly three months on a tour, which has certainly been in the ingaest degree instructive to myself, and will, I trust, increase mv powers of useful ness as His Majesty s Bepresentative in this country.

We congratulate the Viceroy, on the part of the Persian nation, on his arrival on our frontier ; we expect good results from his visit, and we pray the Almighty for the continuation and consolidation of friendship and union between Persia and her old friend Great Britain, who rules to-day over millions of our co-religionists in the East, whose prosperity and welfare we desire.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that as information had been received from the British Legation that his Excellency Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, is visiting the Persian Gulf, the matter was brought to the notice of His Imperial Majesty the Shah, who was graciously pleased to order his Excellency the Ala-ed-Dowleh, Governor- General of Ears, to receive and welcome the Viceroy, on the part of His Majesty, at Bushire, on the 2nd December. His Excellency the Salar Moazzem, Governor of the Gulf Ports, will meet and receive the Viceroy at Bunder Abbas on the 22nd November. His Excellency Hussein Kuli Khan Nawab, who is an official of the Foreign Office, has been specially sent on the part of the Foreign Office to welcome his Excellency. No. 9. Sir N.

I HAVE the honour to submit, for your Excellency’s information, the following extract from my diary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, under “The Persian Oil Company (Mr. D’Arcys Concession) have at last found oil, though not yet in large quantities. They have bored one well to a depth of about I3 :.8r -1 1.800 feet and another to about 1,000 feet, and I am informed that they have found oil in both. This opens out a favourable prospect for the undertaking, and if it should be even moderately successful I foresee, as a near consequence, the exploitation and opening up of southern and south-western Persia to Europe, and chiefly English trade and civilization. Mr. D’Arcy contemplates transporting the oil to Muhammarah by a pip —_ line of about 500 miles over mountain and dale, a very arduous and expens&gt;—] under taking. This line has already been surveyed for about half—the most difficult half—of it* length, and has been reported as quite feasible. If oil is discovered in large quantities I think it probable that the Turks will give trouble. They have already constantly opposed the undertaking in various ways, and may claim an extension of the Turco-Persian frontier so as to include the greater portion of the oil-fields in their own border.” I have, &amp;c.

I do not think it is likely there will be any difficulty in delimiting the small strip of country from El Ukla to El Duki, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs frequently assured me that the Irade sanctioning our retention of El Ukla would naturally imply the acceptance of thp frontier line described in the Memorandum inclosed in my despatch No. 546 of the 8th September last, and that instructions would be given in this sense to the Turkish Commissioners. In any case the matter does not seem of importance or likely to delay a satisfactory settlement, as Mr. Fitzmaurice says, in his ielearam No. 36, that he can settle the matter with the Turks. - ^</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100028322646.0x000002_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/143/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100028322646.0x000002</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/143/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 1421/1908 Pt 1 'Persia: oil; D'Arcy Oil Syndicate'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1904/1909</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-11-04T14:24:40</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (109 folios)</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Part 1 consists of correspondence relating to work connected to the Persian oil wells of the D'Arcy Syndicate, and Concessions Syndicate Ltd.
