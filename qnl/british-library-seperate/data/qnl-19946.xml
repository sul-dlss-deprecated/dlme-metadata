Samuel Hennell refers to a recent incident involving Lieutenant James Tronson, Commander of the HC brig of war,
                           Euphrates,who was detained by sirbaz [foot soldiers] upon his arrival at Bushire. Hennell recounts his recent communications with the Sirteep, Moostufa Kooly Khan, who had been unaware that officers of the Naval Squadron were in the habit of landing and embarking at all hours. Hennell forwards details (not included) of an arrangement proposed by the Sirteep, whereby any officer wishing to land after sunset would be accompanied by two non-commissioned officers.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000059#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
