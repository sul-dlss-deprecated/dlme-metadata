The State completed the second year of the war with a reduction of normal revenue of about two lakhs. The falling off was principally in oil revenue and customs receipts but in spite of a smaller income the Reserve Fund was increased by the addition of approximately fourteen lakhs. During the year the Reserve Fund was transferred from England, where it had been invested in sterling stock, to India where it was re-invested in rupee securities. This action was taken on the advice of the Political Resident. The profit which was made on the transaction was added to the Reserve Fund and brought up the year's investment to 14 lakhs. Owing to the war there was a great increase in the cost of living but the measures which were taken by the Government to control prices of essential requirements and to prevent profiteering were successful in keeping prices in Bahrain very much lower than in neighbouring states and countries. The Bahrain public rarely show appreciation or gratitude for any action taken by the Government to benefit the people but in this case even the man in the street appeared to appreciate the Government's rules and restrictions and the only complaints were from merchants who were prevented from profiting unduly at the expense of the poor. In spite of much genuine want among the poorer classes, which was only partly relieved by an unexpectedly successful diving season, there was no serious crime though there was an increase in petty thieving. Considering the size of the population the crime statistics show that the people of Bahrain are an exceptionally law-abiding community. Much of the credit for this is due to the police, though they are not highly trained they are effective in preserving law and order which is their principal duty. A considerable proportion of the annual expenditure was devoted to social services, mainly medical and educational. The State now possesses the largest and best equipped hospital in the Persian Gulf which is full to overflowing both on the men's side and on the women's side. In addition to hospital work medical services have been extended throughout the islands by country clinics and through anti-malaria work. During an epidemic of small-pox it was possible for the first time for the Government to insist upon infected persons being removed from their homes to the Quarantine station. Propaganda was undertaken, especially in the schools, in connection with malaria and eye diseases. The majority of the inhabitants of Bahrain are suffering from trachoma. Attendance at Boys' and Girls' Schools increased and during the year the large new workshop of the Technical School was opened. Students from other parts of the Gulf are now being educated in the Bahrain schools. An ambitious scheme for starting a Gulf College, with financial support from the British Council, was indefinitely postponed as it seemed impossible to consider it during the war. The Manamah Muharraq swing bridge, linking the two islands and the two chief towns in Bahrain, was finally completed at the end of the year. The building of the bridge and causeway, which started 12 years ago, was originally suggested by His Highness Shaikh Hamad. Apart from its usefulness to the people of6 Bahrain the bridge, owing to the war, is of great military value. The bridge is free to pedestrians but motor vehicles pay a toll. During the first month that it was opened about 30,000 pedestrians used the bridge and it is estimated that the revenue from vehicles will amount to about Rs. 2,500 monthly. The budget for year 1361 is a conservative one, the principal feature being the small amount allocated to public works. Owing to the war building is difficult and costly and in many cases imported material is impossible to obtain. A scheme for a town water supply to be made by linking up several artesian wells and piping water throughout Manamah town was abandoned as the prospect of obtaining pipes, etc., was too indefinite. When conditions make this work possible it would be a welcome public amenity and would also contribute towards reducing malaria by doing away with house wells. The prospects, financial, commercial and political, for the coming year depend upon the course of the war which so far, except by increasing the cost of living, has scarcely affected the life of Bahrain. The majority of the inhabitants have no conception of the conditions in other countries which are closer to the war zone and few of them realise that it is not out of the bounds of possibility that Bahrain may be more acutely affected as the war continues. Bahrain 1 C. DALRYMPLE BELGRAVE. Adviser to the Government of Bahrain.11 REVENUE 1360. In the budget for 1360 I anticipated that the revenue would be Rs. 35,64,000. The actual revenue was Rs. 44,32,000. The actual revenue exceeded the budgeted amount in all sources except Judicial Receipts but the budget was a very conservative one. The total revenue in 1360 was Rs. 4,68,000 less than in 1359 y ears there were large abnormal receipts which cannot be classed as ordinary income. In 1359 the Government received Rs. 5,61,000 on account of the new oil concession and from the sale of rice previously bought as a war measure. In 1360 one lakh of rupees which had been lent to the electric undertaking was refunded, Rs. 1,76,000 was the profit made by the sale of War Loan securities on the transfer of the Reserve Fund from England to India and Rs. 39,000 was received from His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad who purchased a building in Manamah which had previously been acquired by the Government. This sum was included under the heading ' Miscellaneous Receipts.' Taking into consideration these abnormal receipts in both years there was a decrease in revenue during 1360 of approximately 2 J lakhs. A comparison of the 1359 and 1360 revenues shows that in 1360 the oil royalty declined by Rs. 1,87,000, Customs Receipts were Rs. 89,000 lower and most other sources of revenue, with the exception of interest from the Reserve Fund, produced slightly less than in the previous year. At the end of 1360 the State had a balance of Rs. 4,58,000, apart from the Reserve Fund, and no financial liabilities. EXPENDITURE 1360. The total expenditure during 1360 was Rs. 31,53,000 and Rs. 13,97,000 was added to the Reserve Fund. Payments to the Ruling Family from oil royalties and the Civil List amounted to Rs. 14,23,000. This was less than last year owing to the decrease in oil royalty. Administrative services cost Rs. 3,13,000 which was about Rs. 25,000 less than the estimated expenditure but approximately Rs. 18,000 more than the expenditure in 1359. The increase in the salaries of magistrates accounted for about Rs. 6,000 of this amount. Expenditure on public health was Rs. 2,42,000 which was Rs. 10,000 less than the budgeted amount but about Rs. 37,000 more than during last year. The increase in expenditure corresponds to the expansion of medical work and public health services including antimalaria measures and reclamation of mosquito breeding swamps. Public Protection cost the State Rs. 3,89,000, an increase of Rs. 37,000 over the previous year. This was the largest single item of expenditure during the year. It includes the cost of the State Police, Special Police, Naturs, equipment, rations, land and water transport and reconstruction of a house in Muharraq for use as a police station. The amount provided for Education in the 1360 budget was Rs. 1,32,000. During the year however there was an expansion of educational facilities and additional staff were employed, the actual expenditure was Rs. 1,57,000. Other items of recurrent expenditure were generally according to the amounts allocated in the 1360 budget. Public Works. In the budget for 1360 Rs. 3,86,300 was provided for public works of which Rs. 2,15,000 was for the completion of the Manamah-Muharraq swing bridge. The amount paid to the contractors during the year was Rs. 2,38,500 ; the total cost of the swing bridge amounted to Rs. 4,96,600, not including the road approaches, toll houses and other works constructed by the Government and the municipalities. Expenditure on the works detailed in the Public Works Department budget for 1360 amounted to Rs. 1,85,000. The rebuilding of customs staff quarters was not undertaken and although the expenditure on the surgery block in the Government hospital exceeded the allocated amount the building was not completed at the end of the year and some of the additional rooms, mortuary, garage, etc., were not constructed.12 The sum of Rs. 47700 was spent during the year on additional public works which were undertaken although provision for them had not been made in the budget. These works in cluded a new girls' school at Rafaa, widening the Muharraq side of the causeway to the same width as on the Manamah side and building a second toll house and gates, constructing quarters at Rafaa for the Special Police, improvements to the quarantine station, roofing the swimming bath in the fort and building additional stables, a water tank and latrines. At Budeya new stables were built at the police post and more drains were made from the Government garden. At the Law Courts a garage was converted into a record room for the Minors' Department and some alterations were made to the western flat. New latrines were also built for the Manamah boys' school. Additional work was done at the Government hospital including repairs to the roofs which leaked during the abnormal rain the last wet season, replacing mosquito netting, dismantling an old house adjacent to the hospital, which was bought by the Government and constructing a wall on the sea side of the dispensary building. Hospitals. During the year Rs. 65,800 was spent on the Administrative Building of the hospital which was not entirely finished at the end of the year. A further Rs. 6,000, at least, will be needed to complete this building. The ground floor was occupied some months before the end of the year, this contains store rooms, X-Ray rooms, laboratory, offices and sewing room. On the first floor there are two large operation theatres with anaesthetic rooms, dressing rooms, etc. The special glass windows for theatres which were obtained from India arrived with the glasses broken and there was delay in obtaining replacements. The theatres have walls and floors of terazzo throughout and in many of the other rooms and passages terazzo has been effectively used. Although it is expensive and takes time to apply it appears to be a satisfactory and lasting material for using on walls and floors in Bahrain and when once laid down it requires no further labour. The Isolation Hospital was enlarged and provided with a new septic tank and drainage system. Police Married Quarters. New married quarters for the State Police, on the south of the fort were begun and completed during the year. Each house consists of two rooms with a verandah and compound, the houses are well ventilated and cool and are built of stone and cement. Provision was made in the 1360 budget for 30 houses but an additional 5 were built. The total expenditure was Rs. 42,700. Included in this work is a jail for women adjacent to one of the houses in the married lines. Fort Jail Yard. Rs. 1,121. A new entrance flanked by a store for clothing and a room for the jail guard was built in the jail compound, the level of the compound was raised and the cells were repaired. Manamah Police Station. Rs. 1,045. A large new office was added to the Manamah Police Station by reconstructing a room, in the same block of buildings, which had previously been used as a store. Accommodation was provided for the Sub-Inspector and the clerical staff. Technical School. Rs. 15,396. The new workshop was completed. A cement floor was put down over most of the area. Platforms and forges were built and a compound wall was constructed and a set of latrines, for teachers and boys. A permanent water supply was arranged from the fort well. Only the completion of the workshop had been anticipated in the 1360 budget the other requirements became evident during the year. Bridge Approaches and Buildings. Rs. 37,509. In addition to the work which was anticipated in the budget for 1360 a number of improvements were made on the approaches to the bridge, especially on the Muharraq side. Some of the work was done by the municipalities at Government expense and some by the Public Works Department. The Muharraq side of the causeway was widened to the width of the main causeway and a cement parapet was ^uilt on each side of the road. The reclaimed ground north of the customs office in Muharraq was raised and a two-way road was made with a circular round-about in the centre in which ornamental bushes are to be planted. The approaches to the bridge on each side were raised by stone filling supported by murabba stone walls with metalling on the surface.13 A control house was built on the south of the road on the Muharraq side consisting of two rooms. The building was erected on a stone platform rising from the bedrock, a similar building was made at the Ras Rommaan end of the causeway and at this end double swing gates were installed for controlling traffic passing onto the causeway. Two sentry boxes were provided for the police guard at the gates. Manaxnah Palace. Rs. 2,559. The large majlis used by His Highness on official occasions, was renovated and certain improvements were made. The roof of the palace was repaired and wood and metal work was repainted. This building is in an unsatisfactory condition and the south portion shows signs of sinking. Muharraq Sea Road. Rs. 3,000. A grant was made to the Muharraq Municipality for the purpose of building a parapet on the inner side of the road from the customs house to Busaitin. Budeya Garden. Rs. 2,415. Additional water channels and overflow drains were made in the Budeya garden, which was considerably enlarged during the year. Kozabia Bungalow (leased to the Assistant Political Agent). Rs. 1,775. A jerid fence was built around the building, provided with a gate and certain improvements were carried out. The annual rent of this house is Rs. 1,560. Cattle Sheds. Rs. 583. The cattle sheds west of the fort were completed during the year. Land Department Office and Adviserate. Rs. 1,088. A new office was built for the Land Department in the south verandah of the Adviserate building and two gates and a cement wall were constructed. Latrines for the office staff were built on land to the south of the P.W.D. godown. Maintenance of Roads. Rs. 12,031. About 71,500 square feet of the Manamah-Muharraq causeway was surfaced with oil and sand mixture which has been found very successful on other roads in Bahrain. Much work was done on the country roads in the middle of the island and a number of light bridges were built across water channels. All the villages between the Manamah-Rafaa road and the Manamah-Budeya road are now accessible for motor traffic. The old coast road from Manamah to Barbar, via Jid al Haj, was improved and some bridges were rebuilt. Upkeep of Government Buildings. Rs. 11,692. Included under this heading were repairs to hospitals, schools, customs house, fort and law courts, alterations and additions to the Muharraq girls' school, and additions to the Isolation Hospital where another room was added. The mosque at Abu Zaidan was restored and some improvements were made at Idari pool. In addition to work on Government buildings the department dealt with repairs to some of His Highness' own property in Manamah, which was paid for from His Highness' personal account. Excluding the Manamah-Muharraq swing bridge the total expenditure on public works was Rs. 2,44,800. THE RESERVE FUND. From the time when it was originally started the Reserve Fund has been invested in sterling war loans paying interest at the rate of 3^ per cent free of Income-tax. By making a substantial annual investment over a number of years it is hoped to create a Reserve Fund whose interest will partly compensate the State for the loss of oil revenue when oil production decreases. The State has aimed at an annual investment of not less than 14 lakhs but during the last five years it has been possible to invest on an average 15 lakhs per annum. At the end of 1359 the State had £500,000 invested in London representing approximately Rs. 66,50,000 and a balance of Rs. 5,45,000 in London and Bahrain. During 1360 the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf recommended the transfer of the Reserve Fund from sterling securities into rupee securities in view of the possibility of the pound sterling depreciating in terms of the rupee. His Highness the Ruler agreed to this step being taken. The sum of £50,000 invested in 3^ per cent Government of India stock was left in London as the income from this sum was required for making various annual payments in England, the14 remaining sterling securities were sold. At this time the market for sterling securities was in our favour. A prolit of approximately one and three quarters lakhs of rupees was made on the sale of the securities. It was decided that the amount should be reinvested in long dated Indian government securities yielding approximately the same rate of interest. Advice and assistance was obtained from the Reserve Bank of India. The whole capital with the profit which was obtained by the sale was invested in 1963-65 Go\ ernment of India stock paying 3 per cent. The Indian stock was purchased at Rs. 95 Per cent and the new investment amounted to Rs. 65,36,000 worth of stock, producing an annual income of Rs. 1,96,000. The Indian stock having been purchased below par resulted in a net yield of interest of approximately 3J per cent and the net loss of J per cent in the interest has been partly set off by the profit made by the sale of the sterling securities. During the year 1360 a further sum of Rs. 12,84,000 was added to the reserve which at the end of the year stood at Rs. 78,20,000 (face value) in Indian stock and £50,000 in sterling, at a total cost of Rs. 80,48,663-11. In the 1361 budget I have taken into consideration the income from the Reserve Fund which is invested in 3 per cent Indian stock also the income from £50,000 and income, at 3 per cent, for half a year on 9 lakhs which I have assumed will be added to the Reserve Fund during 1361. It is probable that the investment during 1361 will amount to 14 lakhs but the interest on the additional investment has not been included in the revenue. THE MANAMAH-MUHARRAQ BRIDGE. Nearly a quarter of the population of Bahrain live on the small island of Muharraq separated from Manamah, the capital, by about miles of shallow sea with a deep water channel running through it from north to south. Muharraq town contains over 17,000 inhabitants and another 8,000 people live in Hedd and the other villages on Muharraq island. The most important work which was completed during the year was the Manamah-Muharraq swing bridge spanning the deep channel between Manamah and Muharraq and uniting the two ends of the stone causeway whose construction was begun over 12 years ago. The possibility of joining the two towns by a road across the sea was first contemplated about sixteen years ago. Although the distance from shore to shore was less than i£ miles, boat traffic between the two islands was slow and difficult. Owing to shoals and shallows the little sailing boats and small launches which carried passengers to and fro were compelled to make a wide detour and during storms and low tides the crossing was often impossible. In 1348 (1929-30) the State started work on a stone causeway carrying a thirty feet wide road. The side walls of the causeway were made of heavy square blocks of coral stone, the centre was filled with irregular shaped coral stone. No cement was used in the construction, except on the parapet, in order that water should be able to flow through the structure. Work continued during I 349 ( I 93 0 -3 I ) but in the following three years no progress was made owing to lack of funds. In 1352 (1933-34) the work was resumed and continued intermittently until the road was completed in 1360. The work was regarded by the State as a means for providing employment for many of the people of Bahrain during times when owing to bad pearling seasons there was much unemployment. All the money spent on the project, which cost about 2j lakhs, was paid to men of Bahrain who cut the coral stone from the bed of the sea and brought it to the site in their boats. The deep water channel was used by craft plying between Manamah and Sitrah anchorage, by large launches, tugs towing barges and by dhows from the south side of Muharraq island. It would have been simpler and cheaper to span the channel by a fixed bridge but owing to the water traffic it was necessary to have a bridge which would open and shut. If the passage was closed craft would have to sail round the north of Muharraq island, in the open sea. The question of bridging the channel was under consideration from 1929. It was thought that some type of ferry boat service would solve the problem and estimates and plans were obtained from several firms. Sir John Ward of Iraq was consulted and provided details of ferries in use in Iraq, but none of them seemed satisfactory. In 1352 (1934) the causeway was progressing and the15 need for deciding upon the eventual form of the bridge became more urgent owing to the transfer of the aerodrome from Manamah to Muharraq island. In 1354 (1935) Mr. Lowdon, an engineer with experience of bridge work belonging to the Basrah Port Directorate, visited Bahrain and submitted a report on the bridge scheme. In 1937 the Bahrain Government endeavoured to obtain the services of an engineer from the Government of India to give advice on the work, but at that time nobody was available. The Chief Royal Engineer, Iraq, who frequently visited Bahrain, made various re commendations on the subject with a view to ensuring that the bridge and causeway would not result in flooding the Muharraq aerodrome, Mr. A. Croad of the Central Public Works Department, New Delhi, also gave much valuable advice in the matter. During this time the work on the causeway continued and it was completed on the Muharraq side up to the deep water. In the autumn of 1938 the Bahrain government obtained the services of Mr. R. D. Gwyther of the firm of Messrs. Coode, Wilson, Mitchell and Vaughan-Lee, Consulting Engineers, who were acting in advisory capacity to the Iraq government. Mr. Gwyther visited Bahrain and provided a full report on the question with recommendations as to the type of bridge which was most suitable from all requirements. Opinions had differed as to how much the gap could be reduced without affecting the water levels around the low-lying island of Muharraq. Mr. Gwyther recommended leaving a gap of 200 feet. After this report had been accepted tenders were invited from a number of firms for building the bridge. As was the case when electricity was originally put into Bahrain, very few firms seemed interested in putting in tenders for building a bridge in Bahrain. The most satisfactory tender was from Messrs, Hollo way Brothers of London who were engaged in building two bridges across the Tigris in Baghdad and they were eventually given the contract in the summer of 1939. The contract price was £28,291, but owing to certain alterations and additions the final cost was approximately £29,349. Instead of extending the causeway up to the edge of the bridge as originally planned two additional approach spans were added which besides improving the appearance of the bridge and costing little more than the stone work, allowed a wider space of water flow between the ends of the causeway. The bridge consists of a swing span having two clear openings of 50 feet with four approach spans. The approach spans and the bridge are of steel, the swing span is carried on a circular centre pier, consisting of a steel caisson, which is sunk deep in the bed rock below the sea, containing the machinery for swinging the bridge which is operated from a control house on the Muharraq side of the bridge by means of a submarine cable. The approach spans are carried on smaller piers and are provided with shadoof gates at each entrance to the bridge which close automatically when the bridge opens. A feature of the bridge is the centre dolphin of reinforced concrete protruding from the centre on each side and at right angles to the bridge. When the bridge is open the span rests upon the dolphin which protects it from passing craft. The bridge should have been completed in the autumn of 1940 but owing to the war it was not finished till December 1941. The contractors had great difficulty in obtaining material from England. Once sections of the bridge, ready for shipment at an English coast town, were subjected to aerial bombardment and later two important sections were lost at sea by enemy action. Thanks to the co-operation of the Bahrain Petroleum Company the missing sections were made up in the company's workshops in Bahrain thus enabling the bridge to be officially opened by His Highness the Ruler on 18th December 1941. In former days, when life in Bahrain was a more leisurely affair and people were less dependent upon mechanical means of transport, Muharraq's isolated position was not such a disadvantage as it was latterly. In recent years however the need to unite the towns of Manamah and Muharraq became essential. Property values declined in Muharraq because people working in Manamah or the oil fields found it inconvenient to live upon a different island. The Muharraq bazaar, once more important than Manamah became moribund. The people of Muharraq, owing to the situation of the town could not benefit fully from many of the public services provided by the government, fire engines could not reach Muharraq, sick people hesitated to cross the sea in order to come to hospital; from a political point of view the isolation of Muharraq was undesirable, the people of Muharraq and especially of Hedd became inclined to regard themselves as somewhat independent of government control which now, owing to the bridge, can be exercised more effectively and economically. The need, especially in war time, of direct communication with the aerodrome became a vital necessity.16 The bridge is free for pedestrians. Before it was opened the average number of people who walked along the causeway was 200 daily, since it was opened about 2,500 people cross from one side to the other, on foot. Cars are charged at the following rates, according to their size, irrespective of the number of passengers. Passenger cars 2 annas P er tri P- Taxis .. .. - • - • • • ■ • • • • • 3 ' Buses and lorries not exceeding one ton .. . • • • 4 ' Buses and lorries exceeding one ton but not exceeding 5 tons 0 ,, Bicycles .. . • • • • • • • • • * • 2 »» The bridge is open for sea traffic for an hour in the morning and an hour at night if there are boats wishing to go through. The bridge is opened at other times, by special arrangement, on payment of a fee. Tickets are sold at the two toll houses at each end of the causeway and can be bought in books. It is expected that the income from toll fees will amount to Rs. 30,000 per annum and that the cost of labour on the bridge, upkeep, etc., has been estimated at Rs. 12,000 per annum. The life of the bridge is considered to be 50 years. If the cost of the bridge is taken to be Rs. 4,00,000 and interest on capital allowed for at the rate of 3% (Rs. 12,000 per annum) it would appear that revenue and expenditure would about balance and after about 33 years a sinking fund would be accumulated sufficient to replace the existing bridge when necessary. It is possible that in future the bridge tolls will be farmed out. PEARL INDUSTRY. The results of the diving season were considerably better than they have been for many years. Contrary to general expectation the price of pearls showed a big increase over prices during recent years which was entirely due to the brisk activity in the Indian market where pearls were sold for comparatively high prices. It appears that owing to the war many people in India invested money in pearls in the same way as they did during the Great War. Another factor which perhaps contri buted to the improvement in the pearl market was the cessation of the import of cultured pearls into India from Japan. Any permanent measures directed against the Japanese cultured pearl trade will be of lasting benefit to the majority of the people of the Persian Gulf who depend so greatly on the diving industry. The present improvement in pearl prices, which can almost be described as a boom, cannot be assumed to be lasting because the Indian market will only absorb a limited quantity of pearls and all other markets are likely to remain closed for the duration of the war. The number of boats which went out diving from Bahrain was 222 ; last year there \vere only 191. About 8,000 men were employed in the boats as divers and pullers. In the days when the diving industry was at its height, over 30,000 men from Bahrain worked in the boats every season and though the season only lasts 4-5 months the divers usually made sufficient money to support themselves and their families during the off season. The 1360 catch was better in quantity and quality than last year though few large pearls were found. The highest price paid for one pearl was Rs. 6,000 (weighing 90 chows), another pearl in the catch of the same boat was sold for Rs. 2,000. A diver's share in this boat was Rs. 222 and a puller's share was Rs. 148. The government diving clerks dealt with the accounts of 155 boats, of these only 5 failed to make a profit. On an average a diver made Rs. 104 and a puller Rs. 68 on the season. Prices in the Bahrain market started higher than last year and rose steadily until the end of the season when they were 50 per cent higher than in 1359. Golwa, Na'am and Badla pearls showed the greatest increase in prices. Prices; Opening prices. Closing prices.

According to the usual method of calculation the value of the catch, as sold from the boats, was Rs. 8,09,000, last year it was estimated at Rs. 5,15,000. The value of the pearls when exported from Bahrain would be considerably higher. The advances for 1360 were as follows :— Diver. Puller. Tesqam .. .. Rs. 20/- Rs. 15/- Selaf 20/- 15/- Kharjieh .. •. „ 15/- 15/- 55 45 These amounts were slightly lower than in the previous season. At the annual meeting which is held by the government before the diving season to decide upon the advances many of the leading merchants threatened to go out of business unless a reduction in advances was approved. This attitude shows how much the whole pearling industry has altered, in the past it was the government which argued against the high advances which used to be given by nakhudas to their divers in order to put them and keep them in debt. POLICE AND PUBLIC SECURITY. Strength. The strength of the State Police at the end of the year was as follows :— Superintendent .. .. .. .. .. .. ., 1 Sub-Inspector .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 1 Head Havildars .. .. .. .. .. ,. .. 2 Havildars .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 7 Naiks .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 10 Lance Naiks .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 33 Men .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 282 336 During the year g men were discharged and four were dismissed. Followers, including cooks, launch crew, syces, tailors, etc., amounted to 37. The strength of the Special Police at the end of the year was 146 and the natur strength was 165. The total number of armed trained men paid by the government (police and naturs) was 645. There was no recruiting for the State Police but 9 men were enlisted to replace members of the Special Police who were discharged. Routine. The usual guards and posts were maintained, no N.C.O.s and men of the State Police and 52 naturs were employed on these duties which included Manamah and Muharraq town police. Agency and Palace guards, traffic and night patrols and posts at Hawar and elsewhere. All men who were due leave were given leave during the year. The leave position, which had become complicated owing to cancellation of all leave last year, was adjusted. The average number of men on leave during the year was 56. Almost all of them remained in Bahrain and were available for an emergency at a few hours' notice. The annual musketry course was carried out during the year and every section of the State Police took part in it. The section which won the musketry shield, which is competed for annually, made an average score of 76.4%. Five men obtained scores of over 93% and eight men scored over 88%. The shooting, on the whole, was better than last year though some men who were previously good shots obtained poor scores. Musketry and machine gun courses were fired at the Safra range where a new building was constructed, mostly by prison labour, consisting of a long barrack room and verandah and a smaller room which accommodated the firing parties. Mounted patrols, horses and camels, were maintained throughout the year, half of the horse section was stationed at Budeya and half of the camel section at Jaw, from these centres and also from Manamah patrols were carried out by day and by night. The camel section at Jaw occupied18 the tower which was built on the coast between Door and Jaw and the mounted section was stationed in the old naturs post at Budeya. Several guards of honour were provided during the year and the usual ceremonial parade was held on the anniversary of His Highness's accession. Jail. During the year 302 prisoners were admitted into the jail and 288 were released. The majority of the prisoners were men serving short sentences which made it impossible to organise any prison industries. The long term convicts at Jida island were employed in quarrying and cutting stone. Muharraq Police Station. A new Police Station was opened in Muharraq in a large Arab house, previously bought by the government, which was repaired and adapted for the purpose. The house is very suitable and will accommodate more men than are at present stationed in Muharraq. Head Havildar Mahmood was appointed permanent N .C .O. in charge of Muharraq police. Duties. The government issued a regulation requiring all users of wireless sets to register them and to obtain a license for their use. This measure was enforced by the police who also dealt with vehicle numbers and permits for beating of drums. The police band played every Monday afternoon in the Municipal gardens. Public Security. During 1360 there were no serious crimes except one case of grievous hurt inflicted on a watchman by a housebreaker at night and one case of death being caused by a rash and negligent act. The number of thefts reported to the police was about 25% more than in 1359. This increase in thieving was undoubtedly due to there being more poverty in Bahrain owing to the higher cost of living. Another sign of poverty was the great increase in beggars who used to be almost entirely foreigners but now consist of an equal number of foreigners and Bahrain subjects especially people from the villages in the vicinity of Manamah. The number of Bahrain subjects who were convicted during the year for criminal offences was 259, in addition 135 foreigners were sentenced for criminal offences. These figures, taking into consideration the number of foreigners in Bahrain, show that the foreign element in the country is more criminally inclined than the local population.

It is possible now to review the work of the first complete year of the two hospitals. Unfor tunately Dr. M. M. McDowall, the Lady Medical Officer, left in November for work in Iraq so that a detailed report on her work cannot be supplied. The Administration Block is nearing completion and the ground floor is in full use, that is, the offices, drug store, laboratory and X-Ray room. The machinery of the latter has been assembled and very satisfactory results have been obtained. The nursing staff is now complete in both hospitals consisting of 17 full trained Indian male and female nurses. The system of dressers-in-training and young probationers is working well and most of them are carrying out consistently good work and are willing to learn. Every six months they are given a test. Two new Indian doctors arrived during the year, Dr. S. N. Banerjee, M.B.B.S., from Calcutta and Dr. M. A. Mohsin, Sub-Assistant Surgeon, from Pabna. The former is a new addition and the latter came to replace Dr. Lakra whose contract had terminated. There are four Indian doctors now. Dr. Bhandarkar returned to Muharraq in December 1941, after a year's useful work in Manamah. Dr. Kidarnath has been specially Relegated to school medical work and the two new doctors are being trained in the Government Hospital. Out-patients. The statistics show a substantial rise in out-patients, more especially in the dispensaries which account for at least half. Eye infections predominate, malaria gave a high figure and skin affections, venereal disease and amoebic dysentery also predominate. In-patients. In-patients remain consistent at very nearly 100 a month on the male side, and are increasing on the women's side. The Isolation Hospital has kept full throughout and, as can be seen, satisfactory curative results were obtained. The predominating in-patient disease remained the same, ophthalmia, haemorrhoids and malaria. Deaths were reduced from 4 to 2.4 per cent and were mostly caused by pneumonia and seen in emergency moribund cases. Major operations. Haemorrhoids and fistula still give large figures. Eyes in the form of cataract extraction and iridectomy were also common. Hernia has increased a good deal and Harri son's intra-abdominal fascia grafting method was tried out successfully in many cases. Two of the20 most interesting operations were, a removal of Myeloma of the lower end of radius which had perforated the bone and an excision of a mixed tumour of Parotid, both rarities. Minor operations, hxtraction of teeth gave the highest figures seconded by eye operations. Various forms of repair for Irichiasis were tried including mattress suture with or without cartilage inclusion and one or two with mucous membrane grafts. The operation by any method still leaves much to be desired and is certainly a great necessity here. Injections, injections reached a high figure this year. Malaria largely contributed as5,124 were quinine alone. 1,340 injections of N.A.B. for syphilis were given from both hospitals. Vaccinations. Owing to a small epidemic of small-pox which commenced in August several thousands of vaccinations were done throughout the island especially in Manamah, Muharraq, Hedd, Raffa, Sitra and Sakhir. An efficient measure was passed causing all cases to reside on the Quarantine Island with money for food supplied by the government. Whole families were transported including contacts. The people co-operated surprisingly well and Dr. Steele's (the Quarantine Medical Officer) arrangements were extremely efficient and praiseworthy. The epidemic lasted till December. Al together about 13,000 cases were vaccinated by all medical organisations. Sporadic cases are still occurring chiefly from Manamah. The epidemic started in Halah, Muharraq. Laboratory. 1 his side of the work has increased threefold. The new room was occupied in August and all apparatus can now be brought into use including culturing. More details regarding the type of examination are appended. Anaesthetics. An interesting feature is the small amount of ' generals' used. Spinals (Pantocaine and Stovaine) number 269 and locals (either Pantocaine or Novocaine) came second. The dispensaries. Muharraq has seen almost as many patients as the Manamah clinic and their number of operations is surprisingly large. His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad's visit to Arabia in November provided Dr. Bhandarkar with some daily work. Malaria was found to be more common proportionately in Budeya and venereal disease in Sitrah. Ophthalmia reached its highest figures in Muharraq and Rafaa. The Police. Small ailments have been the chief necessity. Malaria has been higher and more venereal disease has been discovered. The schools. No special examinations were made this year. The school doctor, Dr. Kidar- nath, has at last been installed as a separate unit with dresser and car, he is being responsible for every government boys' school in the island. As he only started at the end of this year no figures can be gi\en till next year.. It is hoped that most schools will be visited three times a week ' Anti-Malaria Measures. Owing to the floods of previous November, pools, marshy land and moisture remained for months in the island and so provided multitudinous sources for mosquito breeding whose results became manifest in the spring. May and June were again peak months showing 20 per cent affected in Manamah out of all patients. The average number for the whole year rose to ir per cent as opposed to 6 per cent in 1359. Results though disappointing at any rate proved the efficacy of the work which was intensified before each bad period of the year. It can only be concluded therefore that without this provision malaria would have reached severe epidemic form as happened in parts of Iraq. Towards the end of the year it was not so evident except in December. One case of Blackwater Fever, a rare malarial complication, was diagnosed in an English employee of the Bahrain Petroleum Company who died of it. Previously only 3 or 4 cases have ever been reported on the island. Chief results of anti-malarial work in 1360. Manamah. Intensified measures against shallow well breeding. Owing to the temporary abandonment of the Water Scheme the controlling of these wells has become a major problem in malarial breeding months and as many as possible were closed.21 Manamah Extension Area No. 1. Work was opened up as far as a line drawn from Sinabus to Adari. Instructional channel cleaning, oiling, pit filling and some drainage are being done. Manamah Extension Area No. 2. The work was extended several miles west up to a line passing through the Portuguese Fort, Abu Saiba, Ain Khadrah, Kawari Bridge to Masjid Haram. The work will largely be routine measures but one or two small channels are necessary and the Ain Khadrah main channel to the sea will be deepened and used as the main outlet drain for the land it passes through. Rs. 1,500 has been put aside for this in the 1361 budget. Muharraq, Sitrah, Budeya, Sakhir, Jezirat Om Nasan. Routine work. Special Schemes. The following work has been completed : i. BusaiUn drain. All accumulations of water have been eradicated by this and malaria has practically ceased in the nearby villages. ii. Wireless pool. Filled in and partly drained with a garden erected close by. The main drain from it flows to the sea but still remains to be levelled and cemented. in. Mission Godluibia land. This land is now dry for most of the year owing to the new drain flowing east to the sea. The following work is yet to be completed : i. Wireless pool drain. ii. Qusaibi pool. Water has been reduced very considerably by blasting and drilling the old drainage channel. Several springs have now been revealed in it. Hi. Ain Khadrah channel. To be deepened and levelled. Propaganda. Malaria. The Malaria Propaganda Committee has met twice and from their decisions the following measures have been carried out :— i. A film on malaria was shown to the schools and police. ii. Practical demonstrations were given to school masters and boys on the life history of the mosquito. Hi. Certain propaganda booklets on malaria and the mosquito have been distributed. iv. A series of monthly talks have been broadcast. General Health. i. A film on trachoma was shown to the Shaikhs, schools, members of the municipal council, police and all the leading people. ii. Literature on small-pox, general hygiene and flies have been distributed to the schools for teaching purposes. in. Certain posters are displayed in the Customs Square with literature attached. Air Raid Precautions. The Emergency Medical Scheme of October 1940 was revised in June 1941 and the following principles were eventually adopted : 1. Centralisation of all medical units in Manamah for operation from two base hospitals— the Government Hospital and the Mission Hospital—both being equipped for any emergency.22 2. Bases are kept supplied equally by the outgoing party in charge of Dr. Steele, consisting of:— 2 doctors, 1 sub-assistant surgeon, 7 dressers and 9 police, trained in first aid. This party will have at its disposal, 2 pick-ups to carry g stretcher cases, 2 private cars, 2 Manamah buses. I his scheme was practised several times at night and found satisfactory. Equipment specially for emergency use was made and stored for instant use for the pick-ups and in Muharraq dispensary.

The probationers should be girls of good education and suitable for training. They would relieve the trained nurses of the less responsible work, and leave them free to give more time to the more important duties. All efforts to persuade this type of girl to enter the hospital have so far failed. The opportunity to compete for a Scholarship for taking their training at the Baghdad Royal Hospital Nurses' School might attract them to serve a preliminary apprenticeship in the Government Hospital. Nurse Fatima Zayani completed her three years' training in the Baghdad Royal Hospital and passed her final examinations with credit. The Matron gave an excellent report on her work and conduct. The Indian nurses are now attending Arabic classes regularly, and the hospitals are benefiting by their increased efficiency in dealing with the patients and staff. Sickness of Staff. A certain number of working days has been lost through sickness among the staff, chiefly due to minor ailments. Kitchens. In addition to the main Arab kitchen, two new kitchens have been started, an Indian kitchen and a Special Diet kitchen. The Arab kitchen deals with the main portion of the meals, whilst the Indian kitchen caters for the Indian Nurses and any Indian patients in the hospitals. A trained Indian Nurse is in charge of it and the Special Diet kitchen and dairy. This has relieved the main kitchen of a good deal of difficult work. Vegetables and milk from the Government farms have proved very useful. The milk partic ularly is of very good quality and far superior to that bought locally. Linen. The hospitals are now adequately stocked with linen, most of which has been made by the hospital sewing woman who has finished 2,426 articles during the past twelve months, as well as doing all linen repairs.29 LAND REGISTRATION DEPARTMENT. Total registrations of property during the year amounted to 765, covering 837 properties. This was an increase of approximately 200 registrations compared to the previous year, mainly due to the fact that about 250 land disputes, many of them pending for several years, were finally disposed of by the Bahrain Court. The court now sits aside one day in the week for dealing with land disputes and applications for the registration of titles. The fees which were collected amounted to Rs. 8,200. The registrations included 487 houses, 259 gardens and pieces of land and 53 shops ; other registrations were for enclosures, fish traps, and water rights, etc. In the past the Bahrain Courts recognised claims by members of the public to government land if the claimant could prove uninterrupted occupation for ten years or more. The interpretation of the original proclamation on this subject was in dispute between the Land Department and the Bahrain Court. The whole question of acquisition of land by occupation was examined by the senior Shaikhs who made certain recommendations to His Highness the Ruler. It was decided that no claim for ownership of government land would be accepted unless the occupation dated from the year 1336, or before that date. A new proclamation was issued clarifying the position which applied to any cases occurring after the date of the proclamation. It had been found that numbers of foreigners, usually Hassawis and Persians, acquired valuable property in Manamah and Muharraq by bringing witnesses to court who gave evidence that the applicants had occupied the ground by living on it in huts for a period of ten years. Land rents collected by the department amounted to Rs. 7,300. Over 300 small plots of ground, mostly in Manamah, are leased for nominal sums to persons who have built ' barastis ' upon them. This ground rent establishes the government's ownership of the land. A sum of Rs. 1,900 was obtained by the sale of small pieces of ground, most of them being narrow lanes or blank alleys which were purchased by persons owning the adjacent property. Renewals of fish trap licenses produced Rs. 1,300. Ten sites for fish traps were leased to fishermen by the department. It has now been established that the shores around the islands are the property of the State and the public cannot set up fish traps without obtaining permission from the government. Over 160 land cases are still pending in the Bahrain Courts. The new regulation about acquisi tion of property by occupation will probably result in a decrease of land registration cases leaving mainly boundary and water rights disputes to be dealt with by the courts. The cost of the census, which was carried out at the end of 1359' amounted to Rs. 3,126. JUDICIAL. The Bahrain Courts. There was an increase in the number of cases heard during the year but a decrease in the number of important civil suits which resulted in less court fees being collected. In the Bahrain Court 680 cases were heard of which 105 were criminal, 540 cases were disposed of and 140 civil cases were pending at the end of the year. The Small Court dealt with 1,397 cases 101 of them being criminal and at the end of the year 330 civil cases were still unsettled. The total amount collected in court fees and fines was Rs. 6,460. Several changes took place during the year among the magistrates presiding over the courts. Shaikh Abdullah, son of His Highness Shaikh Hamad, retired from the Bahrain Court at his own wish and was replaced by his younger brother. Shaikh Daij, who had previously sat on the Small Court. His Highness's youngest son. Shaikh Ahmed, was appointed as a magistrate on the Small Court. He had no previous experience. Shaikh Daij was absent for some time from the court and during this time Shaikh Abdullah was recalled but this was only a temporary measure. These frequent changes were not beneficial to the work of the court.30 Shara Courts. Shaikh Abdullatif bin Mahmood, one of the Sunni Qadis, of the Shafi sect, retired owing to ill health and was granted a pension by the State. In his place Shaikh Mohomed Saleh bin Abdullatif was appointed Qadi. The new Qadi has a more liberal outlook than his fellow judges and in addition to his knowledge of the Shara he has the advantages of being a man with a little general education. He was at one time the headmaster of a school founded by the well-known pearl merchant Shaikh Mohomed Ali Zainal. Shaikh Mohomed Saleh is of Iranian origin and is a relation-in-law of his Highness the Ruler. The court dealt with 186 cases but only 40 cases were disposed of during the year. There is general complaint at the slowness of the Sunni Shara Court and as the cases are received in the first place and then passed on to the Shara the Bahrain Court is frequently blamed for the delay. The appointment of a Sunni Appeal Qadi is under consideration. None of the local Aahms are competent and it is difficult to find a capable and suitable person to whom this work can be entrusted. The Shia Shara Court dealt with fewer cases than the Sunni Court but out of 63 cases only 13 were pending at the end of the year. The presence of a Shia Appeal Qadi seems to expedite the work of this court. Majlis Tijara. This committee meets once a week in order to examine and report on the cases relating to diving or commerce which are referred to it by other courts. Most of the cases which it deals with are sent to it from the Agency or Joint courts. During the year 58 cases were referred to the Majlis from Bahrain courts, most of them coming from the Small Court, of these 41 cases were settled. The Majlis frequently obtains a settlement by compromise. From the point of view of the Bahrain Courts the work of the Majlis is satisfactory. The members are unpaid but the President, one of the Ruling Family, receives a salary. Appeal Courts. Six appeals from the Shia Shara Court were disposed of by the Appeal Qadi. The Senior Appeal Court, consisting of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Alkhalifah, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Alkhalifah and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, heard 20 cases from the Bahrain Court and the Sunni Shara Court of which 16 cases were disposed of. The lack of a Sunni Appeal judge makes the work of this court very difficult when it has to examine cases from the Shara Court. In one important case reference was made to Al-Azhar in Cairo for a ruling which, at the end of the year, had not yet been received. In criminal cases, which are comparatively few, the Bahrain Court is guided by the Sudan Penal Code. This code, although it has not been officially adopted, is constantly referred to by the magistrates and also by the police. This arrangement appears to be working satisfactorily. MANAMAH MUNICIPALITY. The municipal revenue during 1360 was Rs. 1,07,479 and the expenditure was Rs. 92,584. The revenue included the government grant of Rs. 24,000 and receipts from house and shop taxes, licenses and other sources. Several new roads were opened during the year including one on south-west side of Manamah from the Manamah-Rafa'a road down to the government hospital. Seventy-eight houses were removed to make this road which is 40 feet wide and 2,000 feet long. Part of the ground crossed by the road was low lying and liable to become flooded, the road and the open ground adjacent to it has been raised and this area has been much improved. Many of the town roads including the Manamah-Rafa'a road as far as the municipal boundary were surfaced with a mixture of sand and crude oil which has been found lasting and effective. The cost of this work consists of the transport of the oil from the refinery, where it is available without payment and the labour necessary for mixing and laying it. Good progress was made in reclaiming the swamp on the south of the town behind the Arabian Mission. All this ground is now free of water. In the future it can be utilised for building sites for expansion of Manamah town.The usual town cleaning work was carried out during the year which included repairs to public latrines, removal of refuse which is used for reclaiming portions of the sea inside the sea road, construc tion of additional drains and spreading sand in the bazzar streets after rain. The municipality undertook the work of constructing and roofing several long drains, at government expense, connected with the anti-malaria measures and also built several drains at its own expense. The low-lying situation of Manamah town, most of which is only a few feet above sea-level, renders it liable to flooding in the rainy season and the flood water is difficult to disperse. The drain age work which has been accomplished during the last two years has been of great benefit to the town. The municipality persevered in its attempts to beautify the town by planting trees along the roads although owing to salty soil and the depredations of camels many of the trees fail to survive. In addition to municipal work the municipality carried out several important works for the government including the construction of the approaches to the Manamah-Muharraq bridge, digging air raid shelters and carrying crude oil from the refinery for anti-malaria work. The municipal authorities co-operated whole-heartedly with the state medical department in all anti-malaria measures. Among the miscellaneous duties of the municipality were supervising the sale of meat and vegetables, selling ice during the summer, burying paupers, maintaining the municipal lunatic asylum, distributing food to the poor, and issuing permits for masons, hotel-keepers, barbers, etc., and taking steps to repair or remove dangerous buildings. The majlis sat 16 times and the sub-committee met 18 times, 14 cases were filed in various courts and 92 decisions were recorded in the minutes of the meetings. Little important work was done by the Muharraq municipality during the year. The main road from the pier through the bazaar to His Highness's house was widened in places and a causeway was built at the back of the town across an inlet of the sea to the Abu Maher quarter. The munici pality carried out work on behalf of the government on the approaches to the Manamah-Muharraq bridge and widened the causeway on the Muharraq side, the other work of the municipality consisted of routine services. The opening of the bridge has loosened a flow of motor traffic into Muharraq town which demonstrates the need for wider streets inside the bazaar. The sea road extension to Busaiteen which was completed in 1360 has proved of great value and relieves the town from all traffic to other parts of the island. The Muharraq municipality lacks the energy and enterprise of the Manamah municipality, admittedly its resources are less but it does not put them to the best use. The revenue collected during the year was Rs. 22,750. This amount was spent as usual on the upkeep of mosques and matams and in providing the various services for which the wakf properties were dedicated. Approximately Rs. 5,000 was spent in repairing mosques and matams and in improving wakf property. Rs. 10,500 was the cost of new property purchased by the department. By degrees the department is registering all wakf property in the Land Registration Depart ment. This has entailed a certain amount of litigation in the Bahrain Court through which all applica tions for registration of titles to land have to pass. In some cases wakf claims have been rejected as lacking sufficient proof of their being wakf. In addition to registration of known wakfs the depart ment discovered and proved in court several wakf properties which were previously unknown. THE MUHARRAQ MUNICIPALITY. Revenue Expenditure .. Rs. 51,065. Rs. 60,665. SHIA WAKF DEPARTMENT.32 EDUCATION. Government Boys' Schools. The past year has seen several changes of major importance in the Education Department. The total number of boys attending the schools has not increased to any great extent as this is limited by the size of the school buildings, all of which have been filled to capacity for some time. As is to be expected the lower classes are the greatest in size while the numbers in the higher classes are consi derably reduced, the average figure being 16 for the big schools and 12 for the village schools. At the beginning of the school year in Shaaban the total number of pupils registered was 1,200, about 75 per cent attending regularly. As the year progresses there is always a decrease of about 5 per cent in the town schools and 10 per cent in the villages. During the early summer there was much discontent among the Palestinian staff. It seems that they were under the impression that they had been asked to come down from Palestine in order to raise the standard of teaching and therefore should be given senior posts at once, although most of them had far less experience than our older Bahrain masters. Many cases of insubordination occurred. Minor grievances were enlarged upon and all kinds of petty complaints were put forward. These culminated in a strike of most of the Palestinians and the repatriation of the ringleader. At the end of the school year three of the senior foreign staff resigned for family reasons ; one a Palestinian and the others Syrians. Mr. Adrian Vallance left the Department in Jumada A1 Awal (June 1941) and Mr. F. J. Wakelin of the British Council, Cairo, took his place in Shaaban. (October 1941.) Ten new members of the staff were recruited locally : four to replace the foreign teachers who had left at the end of the term ; one as Head Master to the Secondary School; four for the lower classes of schools where the ratio of pupils to teachers was too high and an Indian for the Secondary School. In Shaaban, the beginning of the School Year, another class of 25 boys was added to the ' Kulliyeh These had been picked from the three town schools by formal examination and con siderations of health and intelligence. 11 were chosen from Manamah, 9 from Muharraq and 5 from Hedd. This brought the total of both classes to 45. The former name of ' Kulliyah ' was changed to that of Secondary School (Madraset Al Thanawieh) in accordance with the practice in other Arab countries. Since the opening of the Secondary School in 1360 it had been possible for boys living in Hedd and Muharraq to obtain a free mid-day meal and in some cases free board during the week. The new term brought further applications for these facilities which were then developed and rationalised. All Hedd boys were provided with free accommodation and board while all Muharraq boys were given a free mid-day meal six days per week. 5 students from Kuwait and three from Hedd who were studying at the Technical School were also accommodated at the Hostel. Arrangements were made for the introduction of fees for those who could afford to pay, from the 1st Muharram 1361. The post of Head Master and Warden of the Hostel was created. This entails the supervision of both the school and the boarding section. An assistant master was given a room in the school building so that he might take charge after school hours. Rules regulating the times of rising and retiring, of exercise, study and meals were introduced. Dr. Kidar \ath who has worked for some years in Bahrain in the Medical Department was appointed Schools Doctor in Dil Qaada. Every school is visited twice a week, stores of medicines and drugs being kept at each school. Owing to the efforts of Dr. Snow there has been a marked decrease in eye disease and the general standard of health is improving. There was no epidemic in the school throughout the year. A film of Anti-Malaria measures was shown to 900 of the pupils. Pamphlets on this and kindred topics were also distributed and in some cases were made the basis of Hygiene lessons. Each month a free film show is given by the Publicity Office in Manamah and Muharraq schools. The programmes consist of War and Publicity Hlms. They are always received with tremendous22* 33 I enthusiasm. The senior pupils from Suq A1 Khamis and Hedd are brought in by bus so that about 700 boys see these films each month. In Safar a sum of Rs. 1,000 was raised partly by the voluntary contributions of various members of the Staff and partly by the performance of a play by the Manamah School. A mid-year examination was held in Dilhaja for the Secondary School, and the Manamah, Muhar- raq and Hedd Primary Schools. The same papers were given to all the Primary Schools and the results interchanged for marking. This was an innovation and met with some opposition but the results were very valuable. Much remains to be done in the standardisation of the teaching and in the formation of a syllabus. Books are now on order which will make it possible for each parallel class to study the same lessons. Hitherto the choice of material has been left largely to the Headmasters and in some cases to individual teachers. Thus much time is wasted in repetition which cannot compensate for the gaps in the pupils' knowledge. There is still a strong tendency, even among our best teachers, to make the boys rely on memory rather than reasoning and understanding. One frequently comes across rules which have been com mitted to memory without being understood, so that as memory fades the rule becomes distorted. Wherever possible the relation between the material of the lesson and the child's own personal expe rience should be emphasised. A series of notes on points of this nature are now in preparation and will soon be distributed to all staff. The spade work has now been done ; drastic changes provoking opposition are not now so necessary. The results of the earlier work are now showing themselves in the smooth running of the schools and the ordered progress of the pupils. The next few years should see a general improvement in the standard of teaching and learning bringing our schools up to the level of those in other countries. The number of teachers and pupils in the schools at the end of the year was as follows :— Students .. .. .. 1,194 Teachers .. .. .. 53 GOVERNMENT GIRLS' SCHOOLS. The girls' schools in Bahrain made good progress during the year. There was an increase in the number of pupils in the Manamah, Hedd and Muharraq schools and about half way through the year a new girls' school was opened in Rafa'a. A local house was purchased by the government and converted into a school containing three class rooms with a large compound and several outbuildings. The following subjects are taught in Rafa'a ;—Quraan, Religion, Reading, Writing and Arithmetic, Sewing and Embroidery, The school is already showing satisfactory results. In Manamah owing to the large number of new pupils it became necessary to increase the number of classes in the school and five new local teachers were added to the staff. In Muharraq also it became necessary to engage more teachers to cope with the new pupils. The mother of the Headmistress who arrived from Syria during the year was engaged on part time work to teach English and Dress-making and one new Syrian teacher was obtained for Muharraq school. All the local teachers are girls who have passed through the government schools and have obtained the leaving certificates. The girls of Manamah and Muharraq schools presented two plays on behalf of the Bahrain Fighter Fund and together raised over Rs. 1,600. The Publicity Department made arrangements for the schools to see propaganda films from time to time, these have been very popular. Special care has been paid to the health of the girls and nurses from the government hospital visit all schools once a week. When necessary cases are treated at the Government Hospital. This has resulted in a general improvement in health. The school at Hedd is the least satisfactory partly owing to the fact that staff is not so qualified as in the other schools and partly owing to the poverty of the people in Hedd and the under-nourished condition of many of the children.34 The number of teachers and pupils in the schools at the beginning and at the end of 1360 was as follows :— Pupils. 1-1-1360 1-1-1361 Manamah .. .. .. . • • • 2 ^3 3 10 Muharraq .. .. .. • • • • I 4 0 200 Hedd 8 4 9 1 Rafa'a .. .. .. .. • • • • • • • • 7^ Teachers.

The re-organisation of the Government Technical School on lines suggested in the Report of March 1940 was initiated in the early part of the year by the erection of the first section of the new workshops. This spacious and well lighted building, strongly constructed in stone and concrete, accommodates for the time being both the engineering and woodworking shops, leaving the original school building free for classrooms and offices. This extension of the premises made it possible to increase the size of the school at the beginning of the academic year 1360-61, when the present Prin cipal arrived to take over the establishment from the Directorate of Education. Up to this time the Technical School had provided a two years course of simple trade training in either woodwork or metalwork for a small number of pupils, never more than 25 in all, together with some instruction in English and drawing. There had been no standard of qualification for admission to the school and students were admitted at irregular intervals. Some had entered the school with little or no previous education, and most of the pupils came from poor families, attracted partly by the payment of a small wage due to them as apprentice workers. In spite of these dis advantages the school had turned out a number of quite able workmen. Some of these have made good progress in the service of the Oil Company and in the Public Works Department. At the beginning of the academic year 1360-61 (October 1941) 20 students remained in the school from the previous session. Five of these were scholarship holders from Kuwait and were among the best pupils in the school. All the old students were incorporated in the new classes accord ing to their ability and previous training. Some 75 new applicants were examined and 50 of them admitted to the school on probation. At the end of 1360 (January 1942) the school numbered 65 students, almost all of whom seem fitted to complete the courses to which they have been allocated. Since the beginning of the present session the wage paid to students has been reduced from Rs. 15 to Rs. 5 per month. Most of the new students entering the school have been attracted more by the prospect of training than by considerations of immediate remuneration. Owing to the lack of workshop equipment it was found necessary to divide the boys equally between the woodwork and engineering sections. This could not be justified as a general policy for the future as the demand for mechanics is likely to be much greater than for woodworkers. However, a new scheme for placing skilled woodworkers in the local markets is likely to absorb most of the youths at present in training. The engineering and woodwork sections were each divided into two classes according to standard. These work in shifts alternately in the classrooms and the workshops. The students are thus devoting half their time to classroom instruction. This will remain the normal procedure during the first two years of the Technical School course. It should be noted that as the educational standard of candidates improves year by year, and boys are recruited at an earlier age (ideally 15 years), the full school course will be extended from two to four years, an increasing amount22: 35 Rs. a.

Provision is being made in the school for shorter and more intensive training courses which may be demanded at any time, especially in connection with possible wartime emergencies. The school equipment is still very inadequate and there is a serious shortage of materials in Bahrain, especially metals. A considerable quantity of European and American tools were purchased at the beginning of the session. These have temporarily eased the difficulties of working, particularly in the woodwork shop. Specifications have been prepared for machines, tools and materials required for continuing the work of the school and it is expected that most of these will be obtained from India in the near future. With the increase in the hours of class instruction the syllabuses of the courses have been entirely revised. All students now receive 3 lessons per week in elementary mathematics, 5 in English, 4 in drawing and 3 in trade technology. The teaching is shared between four of the five Syrian instructors, an English teacher of Bahrain nationality, and the Principal of the school. Arabic is the general medium of instruction in the school, but the students are becoming increasingly familiar with English. Their English should be of great advantage to them later in their employment or business, and specially useful to those who may proceed to more advanced technical studies. The woodwork department of the school has produced new carpentry benches and tool racks for the shop as well as complete sets of chairs and tables for the class-rooms. In addition the produc tion of furniture and other articles for Government Departments and private customers has been continued. The work is of good standard and has provided useful practice for the students. Up to now it has been difficult to establish a steady flow of suitable work for the engineering shop. The students in this section have therefore been engaged almost entirely on training exercises consisting of precision practice pieces, small tool making and small pieces of forging and sheet metalwork. The shortage of metal has greatly restricted the range of these exercises. Engine refitting and general mechanical repair work is greatly needed in order to give the students practical experience in fitting and machinists' work. A tribute is due to the teaching staff of the school for having adapted themselves so readily to new ideas and new tasks imposed on them during the difficult period of re-organisation. THE MINORS' DEPARTMENT. The work done by this department continued to increase during the year and many applications were accepted by it from people who wished their property to be administered on their behalf by the department. Fifteen new estates were taken over including one which amounted to over Rs. 21,000. The total sum dealt with by the department was approximately Rs. 1 ,25,000. Seventeen immoveable properties were purchased consisting of houses and shops in Manamah on behalf of minors and orphans. Among the properties which were built by the department was a block of shops with flats above them on Shaikh Isa road. Over Rs. 31,000 was advanced to members of the public in the form of loans against mortgages on house property or gold ornaments. There was no change in the constitution of the department which consists of a committee under the presidency of Shaikh Salman bin Shaikh Hamad and a permanent clerical staff.

During the summer au agricultural expert, Hussain Effendi Wahdan. was enlisted from Egypt where he had been working in the Egyptian Agricultural Department. He was personally known to Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa Alkhalifah, His Highness the Ruler's brother, Hussain Effendi took over the management of the Government garden at Budeya.the Eort garden and other Government culti vation, A small committee consisting of landowners who are interested in agncu ure, un er presidency of Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohomed Alkhalifah. was formed with the object of utilising Hussain Effendi's'services for the benefit of cultivators in general. The committee organised regu ar visits by Hussain Effendi to agricultural districts where advice was given to local cultivators. Measures were suggested by the committee and approved by the Government for increasing and improving agriculture in Bahrain and experiments which were carried out at Budeya were shown to people who were interested in them. The Budeya garden was again enlarged and crops were grown with varying success. Vegetable seeds were purchased from the Horticultural and Agricultural society of India but unfortunately e results were extremely unsatisfactory ; in previous years seeds have been imported from Englanc an it appears that these produce more satisfactory results in Bahrain than those obtained from India. It was again found that the cultivation of European vegetables was not a profitable under taking as in spite of attempts to produce a series of crops most vegetables ripened at the sa ' le and owing to the lack of local demand prices which were paid for them in the market di not compensate for the cost of cultivation. Potatoes, melons and sugar cane were grown successfully and profitably. An experiment was made during the year by cultivating a plot of ground on the land near the wireless pool which was irrigated by a local bullock-worked water well. Lucerne was grown successfully and it appears probable that all this area on the south west of Manamah town could be cultivated by surface wells. The restriction on the drilling of new artesian wells, which is unpopular among landowners but very necessary in order to conserve Bahrain's water supply, was not lifted in spite of numerous applications to drill. This prohibition tends to restrict the increase of cultivation but it also causes some cultivators to take steps to eliminate waste of water. A detailed and thorough report on the water situation was made by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and submitted to the Bahrain Government. This dealt particularly with the area between Seddad and Zellaq and revealed that quantities of water wdtbeing wasted in that neighbourhood where most of the gardens are the property of His Highness the Ruler and his relations and dependents. The herd of Government cattle w«?6removed from Budeya to Manamah owing to the difficulty of transporting milk. They provide milk for the Government Hospitals which is of very good quality but not better than the milk from the local breed of cows. They are larger than the local cows and require more food, their chief advantage is that they remain in milk for a longer period than the Bahrain cows. They are used in India as dual purpose cattle, for milking and for working in carts and ploughs, etc., but in Bahrain bullock carts are not used and no ploughs exist. PASSPORT DEPARTMENT. Revenue from passports, etc., amounted to Rs. 11,550 during the year which was Rs. 2,500 less than in 1359. Owing to the war the number of travellers decreased. Few people from Bahrain did the pilgrimage and fewer persons visited Bahrain from outside. In 1359 almost 14,500 persons entered Bahrain but in 1360 only 11,000 arrived of whom 1500 came by steamer, 9,100 by native craft and 365 by air. During the year 97 prosecutions were made against persons who landed in Bahrain without passports. The police patrol on the south coast of Bahrain reduced the number of Qatar subjects who in previous years landed illegally in the neighbourhood of Jaww and Door. Persian divers employed and indebted to Bahrain nakhudas were permitted to enter Bahrain without passports after verification by the nakhudas.I 37 PRICE CONTROL. Price control and prevention of profiteering measures continued to be enforced throughout the year under the direction of Mr. C. C. L. deGrenier, the Director of Customs, who is responsible for this important work in addition to his customs duties. The various measures which are taken by the Government to prevent hoarding, overcharging and to ensure a sufficient and fair distribution of food supplies are extremely distasteful to the general mercantile community who compare sadly the difference in their profits in this war and in the last war. The general public however are unani mously grateful to the Government for the action which has been taken and which they fully appreciate as they are aware of the great difference in prices of foodstuffs in Bahrain and in the neighbouring countries and Gulf states. Recently the price of a bag of sugar in Bahrain was Rs. 33-8, at the same time the cost of a bag in Kuwait was Rs. 70 and in Dubai, Rs. 80 ; in Basra sugar was sold at Re. 1 per pound. The price control would be more effective if more people made complaints to the authori ties, unfortunately however so many of the poorer people in the country are in debt to the shopkeepers with whom they deal and therefore they are afraid of making complaints when they are overcharged. The system which has been followed allows a reasonable and sure profit to importers, whole salers and retailers. Current market prices are fixed according to the prices of the goods when they are imported and when the tariff is changed, from time to time, the public are informed by notices, in the newspapers and by broadcast. In addition to these methods of acquainting the public with the correct tariff special shops have been opened in Manamah and Muharraq for retail dealing at controlled prices. This experiment appears to be likely to meet with success. In spite of shipping and export difficulties it has been possible to preserve in Bahrain a supply of essential foodstuffs sufficient in most cases for about five or six months though certain commodities cannot be kept more than two months owing to deterioration. The export of foodstuffs from Bahrain to the mainland is carefully supervised in order not to reduce the supply in Bahrain too drastically at the same time with the view of not diverting transit trade from Bahrain to other ports. In spite of the efforts of the Government to stem the rising tide of prices the cost of all foodstuffs and many other essential imports is continually increasing. This is due partly to increased freight charges and speculation but mainly owing to increased cost of goods at the places of export. In this matter the Government is powerless to protect the consumer, all it can do, and this is being done, is to take measures to ensure that no additional illegitimate profits are being made by local merchants. The inevitable result is that local wage earners cannot buy as much as they used to with the same amount of money. Bahrain is liable to be seriously affected by the high prices prevailing in Iraq. Although the quantity of dates which are grown locally in Bahrain increases every year there is still a large import of dates from Iraq. The price of Basrah dates has increased 145 per cent over last season's prices. Among the instances of increased prices of goods imported from Great Britain are following items Cigarettes .. Hardware .. Cooking utensils Haberdashery and hosiery Hefiwear and footwear .. Indian cement (others unavailable) increased by about 40% „ » 200% ,, 100% „ „ 100% „ » 75% » 50% Another cause which has had an effect on trade is the necessity for paying cash against docu ments at sight for all imports which prevents small importers from trading on credit. It seems pro bable that Bahrain will come to depend mainly upon India for its imports owing to the difficulties in trading with the United States or Britain. Here too the local merchant is confronted with restric tions on the export of many goods except with a permit from the Government of India. The outlook for the future is gloomy and it seems inevitable that the cost of living will steadily increase until the war is over and normal conditions return.38 STATE ENGINEER'S DEPARTMENT. Electricity. Units generated for the year 1360 showed an increase of 9,125 over year 1359* Units sold during the year 1360 showed an increase of 21,293 over 1359- ex tra load connected amounted to 43 kilowatts. The nature of the new load connected during 1360 was as follows :— 18.5 kw. Lighting and fans (461 points) Power (motors and bridge gear) Hospital appliances .. Air conditioning units Refrigerators 7- 2. IS- • 5 43.0 kw. Revenue from units sold during 1360 amounted to Rs. 1,24,198-14-0 as compared with Rs. 1,26,038-4-0 in 1359. Decrease Rs. 1,839-6-0. The decrease in revenue was due to :— (a) the lighting restrictions (as imposed under Defence Regulations) ; (b) a reduction in the price of electricity for lighting and fans (one anna per unit), which reduced the annual income from this source by approximately Rs. 11,000. 108 premises were connected during 1360 as follows :— in Manamah—92 ; in Muharraq—17, Total consumers connected to date—1,617. Maximum load recorded—168 kw. Total kilowatts connected to date—661. Capacity of the generating plant, including standby is 400 K.V.A. Wiring Contracts. The wiring of houses by local contractors continued, 461 points being wired during the year as compared with 786 points in 1359. The falling off was due to general trade depression and to some extent to the fact that wiring material is difficult to obtain. Premises wired by the registered contractors were as follows :— .. 48 premises. 7 11 17 » This department carried out the wiring of Government and certain other premises as follows:— Haj Salman Zayani Mr. Yusuf Moayad Haj Abdurrehman Zayani Messrs. M. A. Kohiji Bros. Government Hospital—Surgery Block. (Ground floor.) Extension to Government Technical School. New Police Station at Muharraq. Manamah-Muharraq bridge—control gear, etc. Mains Extension. No major extensions were carried out during 1360 owing to the war but the following work was done :— (t) 440 volt extension from the end of Muharraq sea road to the Government School and the house of Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohomed Alkhalifah, a distance of 450 yards. («) A new 25 K.V.A. transformer was erected in P.C.L. premises in Manamah to relieve the load on ' B ' substation, which feeds the bazaar area. Air Conditioning. 50 air conditioning units were in operation during the year in public and private buildings. Air conditioning was much appreciated during the hot season, and some additional machines were ordered. The Government decided not to hire air conditioning units in39 future and users are now purchasing them. This relieves the department from maintenance except when carried out at the expense of the owners and revenue will be obtained only from the current consumed. A maintenance staff will be carried as usual. Continuity of Supply. The electricity undertaking has been continuous in operation since May 1930, failure of supply due to power house faults has been practically nil and there has been no failure of main underground distribution feeders or of substation equipment. Financial Position. A new method of allocating working charges and new depreciation rates were adopted in 1360 as a trial according to the recommendations of an independent committee of accountants and engineers who made a ten years' survey of the undertaking. After meeting all charges a surplus of Rs. 41,234-10-6 was shown for the year 1360. According to the original method of allocations and depreciation rates this surplus would have been approximately Rs. 21,000. As the old rates may possibly have to be partly reverted to, it would be desirable to assume little if any real profit, but to put all the surplus to reserve. If the higher rates of depreciation had not been used during the first ten years of the life of the plant, the present surplus could not have been recovered. Funds accumulated under the old system of depreciation, i .e., on diminishing values, can now be put into operating reserve. This reserve will be needed to meet future repairs and replacements. In brief, the change in the method of accounting makes no difference to the financial situation of the undertaking which is in any case sound. The committee reported that the whole plant, including distribution mains, etc., was in excellent condition after twelve years' working and that the staff employed was the minimum consistent with the efficient running of the undertaking. From an engineering point of view the plant as a whole is at present underdepreciated in view of the peculiar climatic conditions of Bahrain which deteriorate overhead lines, steel poles, underground cables, etc., more rapidly than elsewhere. Electricity Charges. No further reduction in the electricity charges would be made at present. Few extra consumers can be expected during 1361 owing to the world situation. Prospects for 1361. It is impossible to forecast what will happen in 1361 but if conditions in Bahrain continue as they are now and the state is not more closely affected by the war the under taking should not make a loss although very little profit can be expected. Fuel oil and wages are at present at pre-war level but all imported material has increased very greatly in price and will continue to increase. These rising prices add considerably to the general expenditure of the department. Telephones. The number of subscribers connected to date is 86. The proposed laying of underground mains to assist communication was not carried out due to difficulty in obtaining material. The present overhead system is working as satisfactorily as can be expected in the very humid atmosphere of Bahrain. This department is self-supporting. (See Profit and Loss account.) During the j^ear a new 50 line switchboard was erected in order to meet demands. Transport Department. The Government maintenance garage carried out as usual the repairing and servicing of all Government vehicles (32) including those of the Defence Force. As no new motor vehicles have been purchased for some years the work of servicing them becomes increasingly difficult. An additional bay to the garage is necessary as the number of vehicles which are dealt with has increased. This item has been included in the budget. Fire Section. The Government fire engine extinguished 17 fires during the year, no major outbreaks occurred. Now that the swing bridge is open the Government and Municipal fire engines can reach Muharraq town and the villages in the island in case of an outbreak of fire.40 The Muharraq municipality agreed to the suggestion that suction pits be sunk near the artesian wells on the island (in the town and villages) to provide suction for the fire engine pumps. A sui vey has been made of all wells and the work is to be put in hand. Traffic Section. The State Engineer's department continued to carry out the registration of all motor vehicles in the state (549) and the testing of brakes, lights, speed, etc., in accordance with the Bahrain govern- ment motor vehicles proclamation of 1357- The licensing (and re-licensing) of all drivers was also carried out by the department, sixty-one drivers being examined during the year out of which fifty-one passed. Baffles are still being fit tec to the carburretors of all vehicles plying for hire to limit the speed to 30-35 miles per hour. Althoug 1 the standard of driving has improved, this is still a necessity. The dimming of motor vehicle headlights still continues and all public vehicles were personally inspected by the State Engineer. In a number of cases it has been found necessary to depart from the standard set, as certain vehicles, particularly buses and taxis, would have been dangerous to drive with so little road illumination. The oiled roads are dark and many pedestrians dress in black clothes which causes them to be un- distinguishable at night. The loading of all public vehicles was inspected by the State Engineer. Legal affidavits fi cm the makers were obtained to determine the safe load that should be carried after taking into consi deration the weight of the vehicle and the locally built bodies. Oil Royalty and Government Inspection. All the oil produced in the Bahrain Patroleum Company's field, amounting to 907,270.038 tons, was gauged and sampled by this department, also 37 cargoes of refined oil amounting to 351,278.232 tons were sampled tested and inspected. The State Engineer is responsible for this work and personally carried out the refined oil inspection. The crude oil shipped from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to Zellaq and Sitra was also gauged amounting to 535.738-47 1 tons - Records, curves, etc., of oil produced by the field and used on the island and refinery are kept at the State Engineer's office. A copy of the revenue curve is attached to this report. It will be observed that the revenue from this source decreased in 1360 (1941), this was mainly due to difficulty in obtaining tankers and to the loss of certain markets owing to the war. Financial Position. {Oil gauging section). The cost of gauging and inspecting all crude oil and refinery products amounted to Rs. 10,909-13-6. Fees paid to the Government of Bahrain by the Bahrain Petroleum Company on account of services rendered by the State Engineer amounted to Rs. 22,723 leaving a balance on the credit side of Rs. 11 ,813-2-6. General. Anti Malaria Campaign. The draining of certain stagnant pools, etc., was arranged by the State Engineer and the Secretary of the Manamah Municipality. The municipal water scheme which was under consideration at the beginning of the year is still held in abeyance owing to the war. Until this is carried out with suitable draining the breeding of malaria mosquitoes will continue in the Manamah city area but the amount of breeding is being reduced by the attention of the anti- malaria squad. Manamah -Muharraq Swing Bridge. The Manamah-Muharraq swing bridge was opened by His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., on 18th December 1941 (29th Dil Qaad 1360). The operation of the bridge and toll system is under the control of the State Engineer. The bridge is electrically operated. The tolls levied are considerably less than those charged in Iraq, India, etc., on similar bridges. At present revenue from this source covers all charges including wages and depreciation and should enable the undertaking to be self supporting. Staff. Since the department was started in 1349, every effort has been made to train Bahrainis in the work of the various sections. The department has 78 employees of all classes out of which only 11 are foreigners (British subjects).Statement of Energy Connected, Sold, Etc., For The Year Ending Total energy generated in kilowatt hours Kilowatt Hours sold Kilowatt hrs. used on works Kilowatt hours not accounted for Kilowatt hours accounted for Kilowatt connected to public lamps Total consumers connected Total Kilowatt connected Plant installed Kilowatt Maximum supply demanded in kilo watts Public lamps By special Contract Consumers by meter for power purposes Consumers by meter for lighting purposes TOTAL 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 549,314 12,158 58,425 152,431 175,259 398,273 30,820 120,221 429,093 .2 1,617 661 400 168 Transmission line Transformer Losses, etc., 21.8%44 CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT.

Exports : The very slight increase in these collections indicates that the export business in dates has continued steadily. There were no exports of Linga shell, but several occasional exports to India of Scrap metal obtained from worn material discarded by the local Oil Company. Care was taken to ensure that such scrap was not exported in a direction where it might be used by the enemy, A. Steamers: The decrease in collections from steamers' cargoes is to be expected; for, although the values of imported commodities have increased, and consequently the duty collected, ^et the quantities might have been expected to decrease owing to the irregularities of steamers and the uncertainties of war conditions. It is, however, thought that the wealthier merchants have endeavoured to accumulate stocks here by purchasing as much as possible from India before the Indian prices, which are steadily mounting, have become prohibitively high. A comparison of principal commodities should be interesting. COMPARISON OF PRINCIPAL COMMODITIES. Year, 1359. Year, 1360. Commodity. Quantity. Average Quantity. Average Value. Value. Rs. Rs.

The general increase in cost indicated above is, as may be expected, more marked in the case of niece goods The stock of China silk is practically exhausted, and the Japanese piece-goods av come here from India with marked increases in the cost.

Import Yard Receipts : The decrease of 17% in the receipts from Import Yard collections which are made upon the volume, not the value, of imports is consistent with the varying quantities shewn above. B. Native Craft: The decrease of ten per cent in Native Craft receipts may best be accounted for by the decrease in visits in Bahrain of large sea-going craft from Iraq and Africa, the latter craft being engaged more actively in their own neighbourhood on war transport, and the Iraq craft being very profitably concerned in direct voyages to and from India in the transport of foodstuffs, a traffic to which a number of larger Bahrain craft have been diverted. I give below a comparison of the visits of native craft to this port ; COMPARATIVE VISITS OF NATIVE CRAFT. ORIGIN. Year, 1359. Year, 1360.

Parcels Post Receipts : shew a slight increase ; and here it may well be remarked that the Indian Post Office service to Bahrain is of very great service to a number of smaller tradesmen who regularly import their stocks by this method. D. Passengers' Baggage : The decrease by 76 per cent in the receipts from this source is interesting to note, and is explained by the almost complete cessation of the old practice of regular deck passengers bringing from India quantities of marketable goods which otherwise would be steamers' cargo. 2. Pearling Licences ' The budgetted estimate of Rs. 20,000 has remained unchanged for several years, but the actual collections from this source, namely Rs. 12, 144' exceed the pre\ ious year by Rs. 792. Perhaps this may be taken as a hopeful sign of improvement in the industry, which is most unlikely although after the end of the season there was some unexpected sales acth it\ in India in the medium type of pearl which that market absorbs; but no permanent improvement may be looked for until after the war. It is to be noted, however, that more local craft went out on ' khammas i.e., co-partnership than in the previous year. 3. Craft Licences : The collections from this source, Rs. 2,228 shew a deficit of Rs. 183 below the previous year. Since the month of renewal, Rajab, now falls during the Pearling Season, the renewal fees are collected earlier in the year, and consequently fewer late fees are paid; also there were fewer craft to be renewed.48 BAHRAIN CRAFT REGISTRATIONS.

The sail- making industry is also labouring under difficulty, as the needed twist fibre can be obtained from India only under special permit. The Port of Bahrain : The amenities of the port remain unchanged. During the winter of 1359-60 the T-piece at the head of the Pier was again badly battered. Extensive repairs have been made which involved the re -construction of the pier frontage, and certain flights of steps were remade so as to be usable. Certain other flights of steps broken by wear and tear have also been reconstructed. In addition the old beacon at the Bab-al-Oqair, where there is a dangerous eddy, which was re-built in 1939, had been battered to pieces, and had to be re-built. This was nsky and difficult work, and it remains to be seen if the newly designed construction will resist the battering of stormy seas. During the year 1360 two hundred and fifty-one foreign steamers visited this port (excluding visits from H. M.'s Warships and the L.T. ' Nearchus ' on buoy-lighting duty), as compared with three hundred and twenty in 1359, and four hundred and six in 1358. VISITS OF FOREIGN STEAMERS. Nationality. BRITISH : B. I. S. N. Coy., Ltd.

The Optional System : There can be no doubt that this system, which was devised to encourage importers to re-export goods lying in Customs' charge by granting a refund of duty pre-paid, operated here with considerable success and did much to assist commercial prosperity. After the institution of the Food Control this option was vested in the Food Controller so that the permission to export should become subject to the necessities of local conditions. As the calls of the cargo steamers from India became more and more irregular, it became necessary to restrict such exports more and more so as to conserve within the State stocks suitable to local needs. This restriction has hampered the activities of local merchants by preventing them from exporting Japanese piece-goods, which are irreplaceable, to other States where there is now a dearth ; and it is noticeable that recent 1\ a highly profitable export trade had grown up as quite a new thing between Bahrein and Iraq, sometimes via Kuwait. Since these goods have to be replaced by imports from India which in\ oh cs shipping50 space which is becoming more and more restricted, it follows that that the prevention of such exports will save shipping space which can be utilised for importing foodstuffs. Hence it is likely that all exports of replaceable goods will be stopped until a complete reserve of food is accumulated within the State, and the optional system will cease to function until the war emergency has passed. How ever, the Food Control ensures a fair profit to the vendor locally ; so the trader has no real reason for complaint under the circumstances. On the other hand it will be clearly seen that by restricting exports the quantity of similar imports is restricted; and consequently Customs' receipts will be considerably less in the future for this reason. ACCIDENTS WITHIN THE PORT. 1. On 2nd March, 1941, a local craft, on her way to Bahrein from the neighbourhood of Jadun Island endeavoured to make port during a gale, and jettisoned some stone ballast ; but capsized in a squall near the West Spit Buoy. Having observed the accident, the Commander of L. T. ' Nearchus ' anchored nearby, sent out her motor launch and rescued the crew who were accommo dated on board, clothed and fed, and later put ashore. The craft was afterwards salved. 2. On the morning of the 13th March, 1941, a local craft bound for D'bai encountered a strong shumal; and its nukhudha endeavoured to make shelter in the creek of Galali, but was driven on the reef and broke his rudder. The ship capsized and later the Port Officer salved its damaged cargo which was restored to its owners. 3. On the afternoon of the nth December, 1941, in a violent storm, H. T. ' Bandra ' arrived in port towing two steel fresh-water barges intended for the Inland water Transport Authority at Abadan, and anchored near the West Spit Buoy, when the ship proceeded to fill one barge with fresh water before checking up for damage after a very difficult voyage. This barge sank ; and the local Naval Officer-in-Charge requested the Port Officer to salvage the barge. An attempt with local divers was made under his planning by Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., but it failed ; and later, after several weeks, the raising of the barge was successfully done by the Bahrein Petroleum Coy. Ltd. Both barges were locally repaired and have been forwarded to Abadan, and the Bill of Cost has been duly submitted for settlement. Establishment: The staff has decreased by one incumbent who has returned to India, and the Leave Roster has been closely followed on the principle of each clerk taking his leave in turn according to length of service. Transport difficulties affect this position, and it is expected that there may be further resignations by incumbents hailing from India on account of their family responsibilities there. There is a definite need for several well trained and experienced clerks here, as the work of the Food Control is onerous and intricate. The Customs War Saving Association is working very well; and its members have regularly subscribed and invested considerable sums in the Indian War Saving Certificates. This is a distinctly praiseworthy effort. Exemptions and Concessions : There is no export or import duty upon specie or bullion as distinguished from ornaments of precious metal; and the traffic has attained considerable dimensions since Indian currency notes have been put into popular use here. It appears to be highly profitable to sell gold in Kuwait and Iraq whence it is believed to pass into Syria and Turkey. The export is controlled by H. B. M.'s Political Agent. Imports .. •. .. • • • • from India, valued at Rs. 19,74,300 „ Arabia „ „ „ 5,06,760 „ Iraq „ ,, „ 6,600 Total Rs. .. 24,87,660 Exports to Iraq valued at Rs. 13,61,650 „ Kuwait „ ,, „ 23,67,900 Total Rs. 37.29,55051 It is reported that the export of gold from Arabia to Bahrain is prohibited ; hence the large quantity that comes here must presumably be smuggled out of Arabia. On account of its abuse for drinking purposes the import of methylated spirits and denatured alcohol is effected under permits issued by H. B. M.'s Political Agent. All such methylated spirits are treated with a chemical agent which is intended to render it unwholesome for drinking purposes. This difficulty seems to have been overcome by the locals who like alcoholic drinks, and the following quantities were imported in the past years : For medicinal purposes.. .. 50 gallons. „ paint-making 15 gallons. „ use in lamps 295 gallons. Total .. 360 gallons. The above figures would lead one to infer that there must be a great number of lamps in Bahrain, while, in fact, the main illuminant is kerosene oil in hurricane lamps, and, in Manamah, electric light. Apart from the hospitals, no one has ever seen a lamp using Methylated spirit. The concession of duty-free imports has been granted to :— H. B. M.'s Political Agent. The Victoria Memorial Hospital. The Government of Bahrain, and its Public Works Department. The Government Farm. The State Police. The State Hospital. The Electric Department. The Education Department. The Bahrain Petroleum Coy.

General: —It may be expected that in the coming year the income from the Customs Department will considerably decrease, for the reasons indicated above ; but the incidence of war, and the operation of the Food Control have considerably increased the quantity of statistical and recording work to be done, which implies that it will be impossible to economise in the cost of the Department by, for instance, a reduction of staff.53 BUDGET, 1361. Revenue. runees ' ' S , antici P ilted t ' ,at the total revenue of 'he State during 1361 will amount to 37 iakhs of i' s ^ 'l'' 000 more an was expected in the bud s et of the P re ™ us y««- Ks. 0,35,000 less than the revenue actually collected in 1360. On the revenue side the oil royalty has been assessed at 26 lakhs. The royalty is paid twice yearly, the amount due for the first six months is paid at end of March and the amount due for the second s.x months .s parf at the end of September. The payment which is due over the period from June to December 1941 ,s known and during the second half year I have assumed that production w.1 be mamtamed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company at the rate of 18.000 barrels daily. This rate of product,™ represents an increase over the rate of production during the last quarter but I have reason to believe that it will be maintained. Customs receipts, the second largest source of revenue, have been estimated at 7 lakhs which T T°i eSS , 6 am0Unt C0llected in I360 - This head ™g ''dudes pearling and boat licenses. Transport difficulties soaring prices and the spread of war to the Far East make it difficult to assess the value of goods which will be imported into Bahrain during the year. Boat and pearling licenses depend mamly upon the state of the pearl industry and though the 1360 season was a successful one the position of industry as a whole is not encouraging. Passport and Judicial receipts showed a falling off last year, owing to the war fewer people travel and civil litigation which used to produce large court fees has degenerated to petty cases. Revenue from vehicle taxes, land income and rents, oil gauging fees and education is approxi mately the same as in the last budget. Education revenue includes the British Council's grant of £500 per annum towards the salary of a Director of Education as well as school fees and profits from work done in the Technical School. Revenue from bridge tolls is estimated at Rs. 30.000 per annum according to a census of traffic which was taken during 1360. The way in which this amount is calculated is shown in a separate note Medical fees have been shown separately, this item consists of amounts received from paving patients and for certain special treatments. EXPENDITURE. Allowances to Ruling Family. Rs. 4,25,000. The Civil List is approximately Rs. 15.000 less than the sum allocated in last year's budget. Previously the salary of His Highness's Factor who was paid from government funds, was included in the Civil List. This official has been dispensed with. Several special allowances to members of the Ruling Family for looking after wells, etc., which were also in the Civil List, have been distributed under other budget headings. Administration. Rs. 3,34,000. The total cost of Administrative Services is estimated at Rs. 4,000 less than in the previous year but a considerable margin has been allowed to cover any unforeseen additions to staff. Education. Rs. 2,40,000. Expenditure on education has increased considerably. Last year Rs. 1,32,000 was provided for education and the actual expenditure was Rs. 1,56,000. The largest increase is in the cost of technical education for which Rs. 90,000 has been allotted. This sum provides for the immediate purchase of Rs. 25,000 worth of tools and equipment and a pos sible further order amounting to Rs. 10,000 during the year. Provision is also made for some addi tional building work and furniture for the new enlarged school estimated at about Rs. 10,000. Boys' schools, including the Secondary School and the Hostel and the Religious School which is run by Shaikh Abdul Hussein, the Shia Appeal Qadi, cost approximately Rs. 1,02,000. Provision has been made for some additions to the staff and also the service of a school doctor to work entirely among the schools.54 Girls' schools cost approximately Rs. 39,000 but an additional Rs. 8,000 has been provided for the purchase of new furniture, desks and tables, etc., and for certain alterations to existing buildings. Public Health. Rs. 2,64,000. The estimated expenditure on Public Health is Rs. 10,000 more than was estimated in 1360 although the actual expenditure in 1360 was Rs. 2,41,000. Salaries of staff amount to Rs. 1,14,000. Provision has been made for certain additions and replacements of staff. The cost of quarantine services is less than last year, a personal allowance granted to the previous Quarantine Medical Officer is no longer paid. The sum allowed for the cost of drugs has been doubled, the increase in medical work necessi tates more drugs, etc., and their price as well as prices of linen, dressings, etc., etc., have risen very greatly. The same amount as during last 3 r ear has been allowed for anti-malaria work. Certain sub headings have been reduced and others have increased as a result of the experience of last years working. The laundry costs, a large item, was omitted from the 1360 budget. 1 he new budget also provides for the A.R.P. medical scheme and for propaganda. Public Protection and Defence. Rs. 4,00,000. Apart from the Civil List this is the largest item of expenditure in the budget. About one quarter of this amount is directly due to the war, being the cost of special defence forces. Included in this expenditure is the cost of the jail and feeding of prisoners. The average number of prisoners during last year was greater than in pre\ ious vears owing to the confinement of numbers of Persians convicted of entering Puihrain without passports. In the 1360 budget the cost of Public Protection was estimated at Rs. 4,15,000, the actual expenditure was Rs. 3,90,000, but since 1360 the cost of rations and uniforms and equipment has increased very considerably. Grants to Municipalities. Rs. 61,000. The Manamah and Muharraq municipalities each receive a subsidy of Rs. 2,000 per month from the Government, in addition they are paid half of the car taxes which are collected by the Government. Agriculture. Rs. 15,000. Under this heading is included the cost of the experimental garden at Budeya, the salary of the agriculturist and the upkeep of Government cattle. Departmental Expenses. Rs. 12,000. This item includes postage, printing and stationery, peons' uniforms, lighting and replacements and general contingencies. Upkeep of Roads and Government Buildings. Rs. 25,000. An additional Rs. 5' 000 has been allowed over the amount provided last year for roads and buildings. Relief Measures. Rs. 11,000. Owing to the large amount of genuine poverty and want in the towns of Manamah and Muharraq the Government distributes daily, through the two municipali ties, dates and bread to aged and blind paupers. Manamah-Muharraq Bridge. Rs. 12,000. Provision for the staff operating the bridge, toll gate ticket collectors, electric power and upkeep of the bridge. Special Public Works. Rs. 44,000. The details of special public works contemplated during the year are shown in the schedule to this heading. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining building materials and the excessively high price of metal, wood and cement, several building projects which were originally contemplated have been indefinitely postponed. Last Year's Public Works Department budget was for Rs. 3,86,000 but of this amount Rs. 2,25,000 was on account of the Mana mah-Muharraq swing bridge. For Investment in Reserve Fund. Rs. 9,80,000. This amount, out of the anticipated revenue, is to be added to the Reserve Fund. In addition any surplus during the year and part of the balance frcm 1360 will be invested. It is hoped that during the year it will be possible to increase the Reserve Fund by 14 lakhs of rupees.
