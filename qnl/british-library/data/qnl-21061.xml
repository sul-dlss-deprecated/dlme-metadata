No. 495-S., dated Bushire, the 30tli December 1921 (received the 9tli January 1922). From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor , C.S .I., C .I .E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. » Subject.— Tyranny of the Shaikh of Bahrain and his family over Bahrain subjects. I have the honour to state for the information of the Government of India that for some time past the Political Agent at Bahrain has been drawing my atten tion to the tyrannical conduct of the Sha ikh of Bahrain and of his family especially Shaikh Abdulla. This has been alluded to in various letters and reports, and I think the Government of India must be aware of it. As the present did not appear to be a suitable moment for raising the question I tried at first to see whether matters could not be improved by advice to the Shaikh, replacing Shaikh Hamad in his proper position of heir apparent which had been usurped by Shaikh Abdulla, and other means. I regret to say, however, that the steps have not put matters right, and consequently I have been intending recently to report the state of affairs to the Government of India and ask for instructions as to what remedy could be applied. I was, however, prevented by press of work in connection with the Minister's visit and my absence on tour and other reasons. 2. Matters, however, have been brought to a head, when I visited Bahrain on 21st December, by a large deputation of Bahrain subjects who attended at the Agency and presented me with a petition, which I annex herewith, and made verbal representations to me. The Political Agent had unfortunately been down with fever and while he was unable to attend to business Khan Sahib Muhammad Sharif, the head of the Persian community, suddenly learnt that several thousand Bahrain subjects had come in from outlying villages and gardens, and that their intention was to appear in a large body at the Agency and petition me when I landed. The Khan Sahib apparently interviewed the heads of the Bahrain community and tried to prevent this attendance ' en masse ', but the only way he could do it was by- pledging himself to arrange that I should receive a large deputation. It was only- after this had been done that the Political Agent was well enough to receive Muham mad Sharif, when it was too late for the former to try and make some temporary arrangement. Consequently, although I should have of course preferred to ask Government for orders first I was let in for this deputation on arrival. 3. The Shaikh had of course got wind of the matter and at the conclusion of my return call at the Custom House, he produced copies of various treaties and agreements he had made with the British Government, and pointed out that he had kept all of them to the best of his ability. His Excellency did not, of course, mention the matter of the petition of his subjects, but he obviously had it in his mind. 4. When I arrived at the Agency I found a large crowd of Bahrainis waiting and interviewed them in the court room. The petition was presented and read and the*individuals came forward and stated the various ways in which they had been oppressed. I informed this deputation that the matter was not one which I could deal with on my own authority and that I was a servant of the Government and must obtain orders from Government. This did not satisfy them altogether how ever and they particularly pressed the case of one man who was present. This man was living in his father's house, when it was attacked one night by Shaikh Khalid,* and the father was murdered and the man himself had his throat cut and was left * for dead. He however survived and was taken to the hospital and was cured after a long time. Immediately on coming out of hospital he was thrown into prison by the Shaikh and detained there for a long time. Then he was released with a view to coming to some arrangement, but just before my visit he had been warned that if lie did not make a declaration that he did not know who had made the attack and that he had no grounds for complaint against Shaikh Khalid he would be im prisoned again. The leading men pointed out that within a few days he would be c4o6fdimprisoned and very likely murdered if I did not take some steps. This seemed to be quite true, and as I had to leave that afternoon, and m any case it seemed probable that something might be done to the man before I could refer the question I came to the conclusion that the only thing to do was to authorize the Political Agent to give the man protection until his case could be enquired in o. I requested the Political Agent to furnish me with details of the more glaring cases of oppression some of which had been reported verbally then, and on receipt I will address the Government of India again on the subject. It is obviouslv not desirable to make the Agency into a court of appeal against the decisions of the Shaikh, but on the other hand, as the deputation pointed out, Bahrain subjects are afraid to take the law into their own hands as the ohaikh is under our protection, and they urge, with s^me reason, that we ought in conse quence to take steps to prevent the Shaikh from abusing his authority. As far as 1 can see the only way of doing this*will be to authorize the Political Agent to intervene in cases of glaring oppression and give the individual British protection, pending some regular enquiry into his case. I will not however make any definite recommendations on this point at present, but will make any sugges tion I have in my next letter. Enclosure of Seriaf No. 1. Translation of a petition presented to the Political Resident on 21st December 1921 by a large deputation of Bahrain subjects. Praise be to God Who had made Kings as spacious shadows to which the refugees from heat take refuge and which is the resort of the helpless at the time of calamities, and Who made their justice a cause of bliss. If a king acts cruelly times change, and any wise man should take lesson of the conduct of his predecessor. Look at the Tasm, Faroahs and Tobba, of whom there is no trace, and look how justice lasts long. The British Government (for instance) has not lost her name and her honour does not decrease. God has blessed His creatures by strengthening that Government and the talk of that Government's justice is prevalent. Her justice has superseded that of Anawsherawan. The people have seen the justice of the late Queen Victoria who would administer justice.to an oppressed even against herself in oy cler to safeguard the interests of her subjects and her honour. After her came the Great King Edward and after him the present King George whose justice has spread ove? all the world. Secondly, we beg to state to the possessor of great wisdom and good temper, the Chief of the Gulf, that the Shi'ah community is in a state of great humiliation and subject to public massacre. They have no refuge, the evidence of none of them is accepted, their property are subject to plunder and themselves liable to maltreatment every moment. Injustice is increasing every day. If we were to enumerate the outrages, we could do so, but in deference to the respect of the Chief we do not do so and only refer to one thousandth part of them./ This Government is answerable to God for our bloodshed and for the injustice to which we are subjected, because she is able to help the weak and the poor and to relieve us from the hand of the oppressors. Then, do rescue us, 0 Chief, before we perish. The inhabitants of the villageQ gathered together to-day to come and take refuge with you, but the advice of the two good men, Muhammad Sherif and Haji Abdun Nebi, prevented them. The headmen refused and insisted on coming to Your Excellency. We appeal to you in the name of God to help us. If you do not give us our rights and do not help us, you are helping the oppressors to continue their practice. Our patience and power are exhausted. If we leave this 'sanctuary and the Chief do not help us, we will meet with death and he is responsible to God. This petition is from all the Shi'ahs of Bahrain.3 Serial No. (2). No, 23-S,, dated Busliire, the 6th (received the 17th) January 1922. From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C .I.E,, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Subject.— Tyranny of the Shaikh of Bahrain and his family over Bahrain subjects. In my letter No. 495-S., dated 30th December I remarked that I had been intending recently to report the state of affairs at Bahrain to the Government of India but had been prevented by the Minister's visit and press of work. I had in point of fact intended to submit a report on receipt of a report from the Political Agent, Bahrain, at the end of November 1921, and should have done so on my return from tour if I had not been forestalled by the petition from the Bahrainis on the 21 st December. 2. I now have the honour to forward extracts from Major Daly's ' Note on the political situation in Bahrain ' for the information of the Government of India. As the note goes into considerable detail I have omitted two portions which are not of great importance. The first part omitted gives two instances showing how impossible it is for Shaikh Hamad to carry on without friction, and the second gives details of the unsatisfactory position in regard to pearling cases which are not properly settled by the Salifah Court. There is no doubt that grave abuses have arisen and that very often divers cannot obtain justice from their nakhudas, who are not obliged to keep accounts, and who are unduly favoured by the Shaikh. This matter can however wait and can be dealt with, separately. a 3. I think Major Daly's note shows clearly that a highly unsatisfactory state of things exists and that the policy adopted by His Majesty's Government after the events of 1904-i)5 {vide Gazetteer of Persian Gnlf, page 943) that the ameliora tion of the internal government should be brought about by indirect and pacific means through increase of influence with the Shaikh and by gaining his confidence and trust has not proved a success. This I think is chiefly due to the character of the Shaikh and the characteristics of the A1 Khalifa family in general. Whether the Government will consider the present a suitable time for changing it, I do not know but I am addressing a separate letter in this connection. Enclsorue of Serial No. 2. Note on the 'political situation in Bahrain, November 1921. Bahrain is in a constant state of unrest owing to the political intrigues of a small party under the leadership of Shaikh Abdulla, the youngest son of the Ruler, and as as the result of years of oppression by the ruling family. Instances of this oppression are far too numerous to quote, but details are on record of a large number of cases of recent date, which include illegal seizure of property, wrongful imprisonment with cruelty, and political murders, for which no one has been brought to trial, and no effort made to enforce justice. On the other hand events of the past few years in neighbouring countries have not been without effect on the subjects of the Bahrain Government, as well as upon the large foreign element, and all have become intensely dissatisfied with the existing state of affairs. For some years past successive Political Agents have recorded the highly unsatisfactory state of the administration which is far behind the times in comparison with other Arab states. Oppression in the past two years has amounted to terrorism, which appears to have been deliberate policy of Shaikh Abdulla for retaining complete domination over his father's subjects. To this end, it is essential that the Agency should have little influence. The constant changes of Political Agents and periods during which a subordinate held charge, admirably suited his purpose. By last year, matters had reached such a pitch, that my predecessor attempted, in some measure, to correct them. In spite of much opposition he successfully instituted a municipality in Manama, which was the means of introducing into the affairs of that town the first semblance of order among complete chaos.Previously the Amir of the town, one of the worst characters in Bahrain, 'but who could be trusted by the Shaikhs to suppoit them in every form of extortion, had arbitrarily collected taxes, practically the whole of which were devoted to his personal expenditure. Meanwhile he aud his stafi lived entirely on credit, and to this end he owes very large sums, which nobody has the courage, under existing circumstances, to claim. Abdulla accepted the institution solely because he was himself to be President, and one Keshan Akhtar (an unscrupulous person who was later deported for creating enmity between the Bahrain Government and its subjects and British subjects) who was his protege, was to be Secretary. His object, without doubt, was to still further establish his supremacy. When, however, he found that the municipal laws conferred on the council a considerable voice m the conduct of its affairs, and the presence of the Political Agent, ^-officio at its meetings, limited his power to overawe the gathering, he and his party, stirred up public opinion and engaged themselves in active propaganda against the Political Agent which eliminated in a petition against him. Unfortunately owing to the exigencies of the service, the Political Agent was about this time transferred. Although it was made clear to Shaikh liiasa, that the transfer was in no way connected with the spurious document compiled against the Political Agent yet it was an opportunity too good to be lost, and Shaikh Abdulla's party freely let it be known that the transfer was an immediate result of their efforts. In fact when I airived here, 1 was told this on all sides, and Shaikh Easa, not realizing that I knew all the circumstances, himself told me that they had been obliged to have my predecessor removed. I was also told by other persons that the same thing had once before happened to Captain MacKenzie, though I was not told on what grounds. On my third visit to Shaikh Easa, he cheecfully informed me that he lived, as it were, under the wing of a sort of ' Guardian Angel ' inasmuch as any one who failed to fall in with his wishes, in any way, invariably came to a bad end. He then proceeded to cite instances of persons who had mysteriously died, or become ruined, and which he attributed to their having at some time displeased him. Shaikh Easa is completely in his dotage, and is dominated by his wife, Shaikh Abdulla's mother, who invariably coaches him in what to say. Once he has delivered himself of his lesson ; he relapses into infantile conversation, and is wholly incapable of grasping any matter put to him. He is so much under the thumb of the lady and Shaikh Abdulla, that he will hear no accusation against the latter and the few persons who have had the temerity to inform him of his son's misdeeds, have invariably suffered his displeasure and consequent spiteful vengeance. The chief Qadhi, Shaikh Easa's oldest friend, and perhaps the only man who can safely speak out to him, has constantly in writing, and at interview, informed him of specific cases of wanton oppression, but has failed to make an impression. In the interval between the depature of my predecessor and my arrival, Shaikh Abdulla and the Secretary, scandalously mismanaged the municipality, and the council was so cowed, that its meetings had become a farce. No member could be induced to say more than ' whatever the President advises I agree to,' but one and all explained to me, that this was from fear, and that they bitterly resented the position, and the many injustices which were being perpetrated in their names. Some time after my arrival matters began to come to a head. Whole com munities of Bahrain subjects applied to be put under British protection and prac tically every person of importance complained of oppression and cited specific examples. I discussed matters with Shaikh Abdulla, who was clever enough to gauge the situation, and persuaded his father to allow him to resign from public affairs, in fvour of the heir-apparent, Shaikh Hamad. There is little doubt that he did so solely because he anticipated that public disturbances were pending, and he feared the consequences. Shaikh Easa accepted the situation and wrote officially that he had appointed Shaikh Hamad to the management of his affairs. In conversation he informed3 5 me that it made no difference to him, that he was an old man and only wanted peace All he desired was that Hamad should inform him of anything important that he had done, m order that ' I should not look foolish when people talk to me.' his tnil&gt; represented his outlook at that time, before he had been influenced by lamily intrigues, and he was always most amenable and easy to deal with. Shaikh Abdulla for a short time accepted the situation. I advised him ear nestly to endeavour to make himself popular, and to dispel tJie ill-feeling every where apparent towards him, in order that later he might occupy with credit the position of Assistant to Shaikh Hamad. He swore to do this, but later events have proved that the situation is not to his liking, and that he still entertains hopes of ousting Hamad from the succession. An insidious campaign was started by Abdulla's mother, who is a masterful person, and has the greatest influence on Shaikh Easa. This lady holds as regular court, and imprisons and punishes at will, with total disregard of the most elementary laws of even Arab justice. Gradually Shaikh Easa has been put against Shaikh Hamad until at this stage his enmity to him, and partiality to Shaikh Abdulla is patent to all. Persons ^ho are oppressed, or have ordinary disputes, are encouraged by Abdulla's party to apply to Hamad for redress. Behind the scenes the case is misrepresented to Shaikh Easa, who is induced to thwart Shaikh Hamad in his endeavours to dispose of the case expeditiously and justly. In some cases in which he has endeavoured to decide, the matter has been suddently taken out of his hands • by Shaikh Easa himself. The news is then spread that Shaikh Hamad was in capable of settling the affair properly. In municipal affairs in which the concurrence or assistane of Shaikh Easa is required, the matter is invariably misrepresented to him, as either derogatory to his dignity, or harmful to his revenues, and if Shaikh Hamad endeavours to dispel the false idea he is accused to Shaikh Easa, by Abdulla's mother, of treachery to him. Shaikh Hamad is extremely popular with all communities, and in addition to being heir-apparent (he was officially recognized as such by the Government of India in 1901 at Shaikh Easa's request) is in every way the most suitable person to manage affairs. He is reasonable, and although not much experienced, is always willing to take advice and to consult notables among his subjects. Our attention may with advantage be devoted to his eldest son, Solman, who will presumably one day be Ruler, and who is a young man of considerable promise and anxious to learn. Shaikh Hamad is no match for his brother Abdulla in political intrigue, and unless supported by the Agency would in a very short time, be put in a false posi tion and discredited. Abdulla has surrounded himself by evil advisers, political offenders from Iraq, Egypt, etc., and spends freely in propaganda and intrigue of every description. He is unprincipled, and consequently unpopular with all classes, and the attitude of himself and his followers is best summed up in the statement of one of the witnesses in the case of Jasim-al-Chirawi, his alter ego, who is stated to have said : ' I will not cease until I have defeated'Shaikh Hamad and the Agency, and have got affairs again entirely into Abdulla's hands. I will not let Shaikh Hamad achieve anything he wants, until he will himself resign, and to obtain this I will get the Agency into such repute that no one will care what thev order.' I beg to quote from the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, page 943—• ' It was felt also that some of the features of the internal administration of Bahrain were not altogether creditable to the protecting British power 1 —— — # Oppression of subjects too, was rife, carried on not only by the Shaikh and by men of the A1 Khalifeh family, but also, etc.' CIS^FD.It is evident from the files in this Agency, that no improvement as regards the internal administration of Bahrain has been effected, have left on record notes concerning the unsatisfactory state of affairs. 1 evidence on all sides that oppression has much increased of quite recent years whereas the population is more enlightened and less inclined to submit to such treatment. I would again refer to tlie Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, page 943 ' The question of a remedy for these evils and bf a stricter definition of the subordinate relations of the Shaikh to the British Government was raised after the crisis of 1904-05, and was duly considered by His Maiestv's Government, who resolved, however, to pursue a cautious J that amelioration of the internal Government should be sought by indirect and pacific means through increase of influence with the Shaikh and by gaming his confidence and trust.' Indirect and pacific means ' have failed to achieve the objects desired and intrigues within the family render abortive effect to gain the trust and confidence of the ruling family. The grounds for His Majesty's Government desiring to pursue a cautious policy were doubtless not unconnected with the undefined position of the British m Bahrain, coupled with the attention bestowed on it by the Turkish and Persian Government of that time, as well as the presence of German interests on the spot. The European war has removed these considerations, and I respectfully submit, that never before have we been in so unfettered a position for insisting upon the long delayed and necessary reforms in the internal administration of Bahrain. To summarise : Shaikh Easa has arrived at an age when he is no longer capable of ruling, and must rely upon someone. Shaikh Hamad appears the proper person, and in fact the only possible candidate acceptable to the inhabitants. Shaikh Abdulla will never accept the position of younger brother or curb bis ambition. I am constantly approached by leaders of every community and am requested to appeal to Government for some alleviation of the situation. I have hitherto discouraged any such movements to the best of my ability, and made every effort to keep matters quiet, in the hope that Abdulla might be influenced to change his policy. This he seems quite determined not to do and the difficulty of counter acting the purdah intrigues of his mother, is, of couxse, insuimountable. It is said to me that, if we extend out protection to the Bahrain Government, so that it is immune from outside danger, we should use our influence effectually, in order that the inhabitants be not unduly oppressed, and that they should have a reasonably efficient government in comparison with other Arab states. 'Failing this,' I am asked, ' Why do you not remove the British protection, then we would at least have the redress usually resorted to by Arabs. We should appeal to another Arab ruler to take over our country and treat us better.' I respectfully submit that these representations made on most adequate grounds, as we have ample proof, are worthy of consideration. If possible it would seem desirable that some precautions should be taken to avoid a struggle for supremacy, which is certain to occur acutely oh the death of the present Euler, and will continue to cause unrest in the meantime. Shaikh Easa, though now mentally weak, is in good bodily health ; he takes extreme care of himself and may therefore live for many years. A further disturbing element is the rapid increase of the family of A1 Khalifeh. There is no outlet for the many younger members, and no attempt is made to educate them for any occupation. The entire revenue, none of which is devoted to public weal, is already absorbed in providing for them, even so, many are in reduced circumstances and resort to various forms of extortion to supplement their incomes. Although the population is settled, and through close touch withthe very large foreign elemetit is rapidly becoming more enlightened, the oppres sion of the ruling family is greater than would be tolerated among tribal Arabs, who are in a position to take the law into their own hands when unusually dis satisfied. C. K. DALY, Major, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, Serial No. 3. No. 24-S., dated Bushire, the 6th (received the 17th) January 1922. From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Subject :— Tyranny of the Shaikh of Bahrain and hisjamily over Bahrain subjects. In my letter No. 496-S., dated 30th December regarding the tyranny of the Shaikh of Bahrain over his subjects, I stated that I had requested the Political Agent to forward to me notes of a few of the more glaring cases of oppression, and I now have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India, a copy of his memorandum giving particulars of certain cases of oppression of various sorts. Case No. 6 was reported to the Government of India in my letter No. 272 -S., dated 21st September 1920. Case No. 16 was the one alluded to in my letter above-mentioned as having been reported to me at the interview on 21st Decem ber ; in describing the case I inadvertently stated that Shaikh Khalid was the offender instead of Shaikh Hamud bin Subah. I regret that I should have made this mistake, but the main facts are correct, and the case is a very glaring one. It will be noticed that Shaikh Abdulla is responsible for many of the acts of oppression. Just before and during the early part of the war Shaikh Abdulla seemed to be the most intelligent and progressive of the Shaikh's sons ; when I was at Bahrain he was helpful in the matter of the landing arrangements, and when Colonel (then Captain) Keyes was Political Agent at the beginning of the war he was very useful and was given a C.I.E. All this, however, seems to have been done with a view to supplant his elder brother Shaikh Hamad as heir-apparent, and towards the end of the war and for some time after Shaikh Abdulla became virtual ruler of Bahrain. When the state of affairs was first brought to my notice I thought that perhaps matters would be improved by reinstating Shaikh Hamad in his proper position, and this was done last hot weather, but as reported in my above mentioned letter it has not had the desired effect. At the same time the question of reinstating Shaikh Hamad came up there was considerable agitation against Shaikh Abdulla and the latter thought it advisable to pretend to withdraw from affairs in case matters should come to a head ; he therefore pretended to acquiesce in Sheikh Hamad's reinstatement but has never ceased to intrigue against him. In this he is ably assisted by his mother who is a very masterful lady and who completely dopminates Shaikh Easa. v The Political Agent has frequently spoken to Shaikh Easa about these matters but he is quite in his dotage and completely under the thumb of his wife, so that nothing can be done in this way. He has also had several talks with Shaikh Abdulla but the latter, while professing everything declines to mend his ways. Another point is that under present conditions if Shaikh Easa were to die, Shaikh Abdulla would certainly not allow Hamad to succeed quietly, without making a fight for it. In the circumstances I think the only way to improve matters would be for Government to inform the Shaikh that owing to the number of complaints against*4 8 Shaikh Abdulla the latter must leave the Island until suitable guarantees are forth coming that he will not interfere in local affairs. I am not sure whether this step will commend itself to the Government of India at the present time ; I am sure however that it would he the best means of ending the present state of affairs and that if it could be taken the Shaikh and his family would be alarmed and would mend their ways. If however this is not considered suitable I would suggest that the Shaikh should be informed that many complaints have been received of the tyranny exercised on his subjects by himself and his family, and that the Government as protecting power cannot acquiesce in such abuse of authority, and that therefore they have authorized the Political Agent to intervene when glaring cases of oppression are brought to his notice, and extend British protection temporarily to the oppressed party pending enquiry into his case. This is only a palliative measure of course and will cause friction between the Shaikh and the Political Agency, but the present state of affairs puts the Political Agent as representative of the protecting power in an extremely invidious position. Bahrain subjects naturally look to him to improve their position, and it is very difficult for him to refuse to assist victims of such gross oppression as are instanced in some of the cases mentioned in the enclosure to this letter. Enclosure of Serial No. 3. Memo. No. 1-C., dated Bahrain, the 34^ January 1922. From— Major C. K. Daly , I .A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of the iepoit recently submitted on Bahrain I beg to forward some examples of the oppression of which the deputation complained to you on the occasion of your recent visit here. The actual cases, committed as they are by the many members of A1 Khalifeh, each of whom have absolute powers over particular tracts of the Islands, are so numerous that under present conditions it is impossible to keep pace with them, and any attempt to assist the persons concerned would in all probability lead to further persecution unless they could be put forthwith under British protection. On my return from Bushire I was greeted on the landing stage by a large number of Bahrain subjects who enquired what steps I had been ordered to take. 1 told them the matter was under consideration. During my absence, a report had been spread, obviously by the Shaikh* ^ (Abdulla returned to Bahrain the day after 1 left) to the effect that I would nol; return and that Yusuf Kanoo had been sent for by you as you were displeased with ' him, and Khan Shaib Muhammad Shaiif would shortly be deported. Under cover of this an attempt was made to coerce villagers into signing a document addressed to the Ruler expressing affection, and satisfaction with his rule. This failed com pletely. and I am told a letter was addressed to you by the Bahrainis. Manv persons applied to the Qadhi for information as to the truth of the rumours spread i ■ by the Shaikh, and 1 am told he sent a letter to me to Bushire asking me to return • but that missed me, and may have reached you. Some examples of oppression of Bahrain subjects by the ruling family in Bahrain. 1. Ali bin Sufra died about one year ago and left for charity about Rs. 45.000 to be a trust administered by one Siyadi. Shaikh Abdulla^son of the Ruler' prompted the brother of the deceased to bring a case to him claiming that the administration of the trust should be in his hands. The case was sent to the Qadhi. The Tatter refused to alter the settlement, particularly as the plaintiff was known to be a bad character, for which reason he had not been appointed trustee by the deceased. Shaikh Abdulla ignored the Shara order and took the money by compulsion from Siyadi. He gave about Rs. 20,000 to the deceased's' brother who had brought the case, Rs. 2,000 as a bribe to the Ruler's chief servant who had assisted him in securing the money, and has embezzled the remainder. By various subterfuges Abdulla also made a considerable sum out of the remainder of the legacy which was left , to the heirs.9 1 2 n ^ a plot ofland belonging to the sons of Mohsin Sisi. Shaik Abdulla sold this to Shabin Al Shomli for Rs. 3,500. The owners freouentlv complained to the rulers but got no hearing. A few weeks ago they decided to make a combined complaint to the Agency. Shaik Abdulla heard of this and called a meeting of some of his personal friends to try the case, this in spite of the fact that he is supposed to have withdrawn from all public offairs. They ordered the plaintiffs to pay Rs. 500 to Shahin Al Shomli as compensa- tion and to take their land back. Both parties are now dissatisfied. The one because they have paid Rs. 500 for their own land, the other because he has paid Rs. 3,000 and gained nothing. Shaik Abdulla keeps a prostitute named Masoodeh a Jewess whom he seduced, and who was for a time his mistress. He has had an arrangement with this woman whereby she lures young men of respectable families to her house. There they are raided by Abdulla's fidawis and sums of money are recovered from them under threats of exposure and imprisonment.' A considerable sum of money is said to have been realised in this way. 4. Last hot weather the wife of a tailor of Sinabis was forcibly abducted and detained for several days in Shaik Abdulla's house. The husband was threatened, and in any case could only complain to Shaik Abdulla himself, who is the absolute ruler of Sinabis. 5. Shaik Abdulla is ruler of the village of Jidhafs. His wazir there, one Abdulla bin Razi and his wife, act as procurers for Shaik Abdulla. Several women have been compelled to visit Shaik Abdulla at the wazir's house. The daughter of Bin Marhun was abducted and kept there for some days, as also was the daughter of Syed Qasim. In each case the parents were threatened and as they would get no justice in any case, endeavoured to escape the ignominy of public exposure. These two girls have since been sent to Qatif each year when it is the season for Abdulla to visit Jidhafs. The cases are well known locally. 6. The rulers have a right by established custom to collect, from Bahrain boats only, a tax on pearls found of value exceeding Rs. 10,000. The tax is payable by the boat concerned. Last year Ahmed bin Khamis bought a pearl value Rs. 40,000 in Qatif, not even within Bahrain territory. When he brought it back to Bahrain to sell, Shaik Abdulla sent men to demand the tax from him. He then endeavoured to arrest him and seize the pearl, but he succeeded in evading him and sought refuge in the Agency where he was afforded protection by Major Dickson, the then Political Agent. Others who have been unjustly made to pay this tax recently are: Haji Hussain Madhaub. Haji Matrak. Haji Abdulla Abu Dib. Ali bin Hussain Haichi. Haji Jawad. 7. No death duties are legitimately levied in Bahrain, and such a tax is un- a,uthorised in Shara. Ahmad bin Yusuf Mahomed died and left two lakhs of rupees. Shaik Abdulla levied a tax of Rs. 20,000 without right. He then by subterfuge caused disputes among the heirs by means of which nearly half the estate was taken as ' Khidmeh ' or court fees which are now levied at 10%. 8. A plot of land with some dwelling premises belonging to Abdul Rasool bin Haji Hussain of Sinabis has been seized without pretext by Shaik Abdulla and given to one of his mistresses, who now lives there. 9. On the death of Haji Khalaf Saru Shaik Abdulla put his property under restraint and did not hand it over to the heirs till Rs. 1,000 had been paid. It is universally stated that he had no claim against the estate. 10. Shaik Abdulla seized the honse of Haji Ahmad bin Shaaban in Sinabia on a false pretext, and still retains it. C456FD10 11 Shaik Abdulla's servants abducted a girl, a native of Ears. Her parents after searching for her for some time returned home and left behind one Muhammad Abdulla to continue the search. He discovered that she was being kept by Shaik Abdulla The latter then passed her on to an Arab of Zallaq, receiving Rs. 400. Muhammad Abdulla on behalf of the parents made efforts to recover the girl He did so on payment of Rs. 500 and on condition that he himself married her. She was pregnant and subsequently died in child-birth. 12. The daughter of Bin Suweileh of Houreh was abducted by Shaik Abdulla and subsequently turned adrift as a prostitute. 13. The daughter of one Khalid bin Qusim was similarly abducted. 14. Bin Kadhim brought a wife from Kowait. He went on business to Qatif and on his return found his house looted and his wife gone. Some time later he saw his wife with two well known pimps. He demanded her return and was told that she had been handed over to them to keep by Shaik Abdulla. He went to Shaik Abdulla who then said he could take her; recently he complained in the Agency about the loss of his goods. Shaik Abdulla is said to have bribed him to leave his name out of the case. 15. Mohammad, son of Shaikh Abdulla, endeavoured to seduce the daughter of Ali Doi, a well known merchant of Muharraq. He failed, but one evening caught the girl in a side street with some of his servants, and posted sentries at each end of the street. The girl was then raped. The father, knowing he could hope for no redress, and fearing above all, loss of honour for his family, endeavoured to keep the matter quiet, but it is well known now. 16. About six months ago atTubli, Hamudbin Subah, one of the ruling family murdered Haji Hassain Araibi, and attempted to murder his wife, son, and daughter. The latter were severely wounded. The son, though seriously ill, was sent for by the ruler ostensibly to interrogate him, and was flung into prison. After being threatened he was released and went to hospital till he recovered. Recently he was threatened with further imprisonment if he refused to write a document to the effect that Hamud bin Subah did not murder his father and wound the remainder of the family. On the occasion of the Resident's recent visit to Bahrain he sought redress in the Agency and was given temporary protec tion till the matter could be further enquired into. In all such cases witnesses are far too cowed to come forward. He affirms on oath that he saw Hamud bin Subah kill his father before his eyes, and attempt to shoot the complainant. He was wounded by another man with a dagger. 17. The son of Haji Mehdi bin Zainel of Jidhafs was murdered in daylight in a public thoroughfare by a servant of Shaik Muhammad, second son of the Ruler. The murderer was arrested but released, and the father was threatened that he would also be killed if he made further complaint. The father stated his case before the Hon'ble the Resident recently. 18. A Political murder recently took place at Sitrah, and another near Naim. No arrests were made except the relatives of the murdered persons, who were threatened to make them refrain from complaining. A further Political murder instigated by Shaik Khalid, brother of the Ruler, took place three weeks ago. No arrest has been made. 19. Shaik Khalid, brother of the Ruler, who has absolute rights in Sitrah, takes one Rubah of fish daily, or cash in lieu, from each inhabitant. This is resold to a person who had been sold the monopoly. A capital tax of Rs. 2 per mensem is also levied by him. A levy of Rs. 25 per head was recently, for no particular reason, made by the same person. Another source of revenue of this member of the ruling family is to demand labour from the Shiah subjects during the period 7th—10th of Muharram, during which time it is forbidden by their religion to work. If they decline, as they must do, a cash fine in lieu is realised.11 Women are eompelled. to bring a contribution of lucerns from their husband's nelds tor this Shaik s animals. Several women have been detained for immoral purposes by his sons. 2° One month ago a young camel which had strayed from the Shaik's flock was found dead outside a village. There were no grounds for supposing foul play but a fine of Es. 500 has been imposed on the village. Failing this, every man in the village must go to take an oath that he did not kill it. This will entail the loss ir~r f a wllole da y to severa l hundred persons. The oath could equally well be taken ^ in Manamehj but^point has not been conceded to them. The case has not yet been settled by the ruler. 21. Shaik Abdulla sent for the daughter of one All Basri. ITer parents refused, to send her. Abdulla's mother, who has recently assumed the title of Queen of Bahrain, ordered the mother to send the girl at once or leave Bahrain. The girl was subsequently induced to marry one of Shaik Abdulla's servants but has been put in one of Shaik Abdulla's houses and is kept as a mistress. 22. Some men grazing camels belonging to the ruler's wife, recently seized a small boy outside a village and committed unnatural offences. The villagers pro tested and said they would complain to the '' Queen ''. When they did so, that lady imprisoned about 12 of the leaders and detained Ih^m in prison. She refused to send the case to the Qadhi and subsequently released them after pavment of Rs. 250. 23. A Bahrain recently gave up the lease of one of the Shaik's gardens because they raised the rent before his existing agreement had expired. He then took another garden belonging to a subject of Qatif. A perfectly false charge was made against him (he was not himself informed of any charge, but one was formulated after his release) and he was imprisoned one month, fined Rs. 500 and forbidden to work for the Qatif subject. In other words, he would be forced to again take the Shaik's garden at the enhanced rate. 24. Forced labour, forced contributions of fowls, eggs, etc., and the comman deering of boats, animals for transport, etc., are of daily occurrence. Commandeer ing of transport, and forced labour, both known as '' Sakhra'' was originally a privilege of the ruler. It is now practised by every cadet of the family and by their satellites, amounting in all to some hundred and fifty persons, and is a great hardship for the inhabitants. The conditions under which prisoners are confined are excessively bad. C. K. DALY, Major I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, Serial No. 4.

In continuation of my letter No. 24-S., dated 6th January 1922 on the subject of the tyranny of the Shaik of Bahrain and the A1 Khalifa family over the inhabitants of Bahrain, I have the honour to state for the information of the Government of India that the Political Agent has reported the following facts :— * (1) During the Political Agent's absence from headquarters for a few days at Christmas, Shaik Isa made an effort to obtain from the principal Bahrain subjects a letter expressing satisfaction with the Shaik's Government and stating that they had no complaint^. The attempt, however, was a complete failure, as no one woul(i sign a letter of this sort. (2) Mulla Hafiz, an Egyptian agitator well known to the Police who was appointed headmaster of the school by Shaik Abdulla, and who has been the latter's right hand man in writing and spreading reports and propaganda recently left hurriedly for Kuwait. Just before the, arrival of the last down steamer the Political Agent was surprised to receive a letter from Shaik Isa saying that Mulla Hafiz was on the steamer and asking the Political Agent to forbid him to land. Taking everything into consideration, the Political Agent decided to accede to the Shaik's proposal and Shaik Salman representing Shaik Isa and Khan Bahadur Muhammad Sharif representing the Political Agent went to the* ship to inform Mulla Hafiz that the Shaik's request had been acceded to. I attach an extract from a letter No. 6-C., dated January 9th, reporting the 2nd incident and referring to the 1st. Major Daly has asked for my approval of his action as there was no time to refer to me, and in view of the facts set*forth by him I have done so as it was obviously undesirable to allow Mulla Hafiz to land. It is evident that Shaik Isa is rather nervous regarding the result of the peti tion made to me by his subjects, and is trying to counteract Shaik Abdulla's activities. In regard to the latter I have to-day received a telegram from the Poli tical Agent saying that Shaik Abdulla is increasing his propaganda and redoubl ing his efforts. I trust therefore that very early orders may be issued as to the action to be taken by the Residency to put a stop to or mitigate the present state of affairs in Bahrein. Enclosure of Serial No. 5. Extract from a letter from the Political Agent, Resident %n the Persian, Gulf, Bushire, No. 6-C., dated th°. 9th January 1922. ********** Mulla Hafiz, the Egyptian who has been his right hand man in writing and spreading reports, recently left hurriedly for Kuwait. I gather that he was told there that he was not wanted. He then went to Basrah, it is not known for what purpose 1 esterday evening I was surprised to receive a letter from Shaik Isa saymg that tms individual was said to be returning to Bahrain by the mail from Basrah to-day and asking me to forbid him to land in Bahrain. Shaik Isa has been in a state of nervousness since he heard of the complaints made to you by his subjects and his failure during my absence to extract a docu ment from them favourable to himself. It is possible therefore that this is a belated13 attempt to put a stop to the work which his son Abdulla undoubtedly started with Shaik Isa's cognizance. Since it would have a bad effect for Mulla Hafiz, whose misdeeds are univer sally known here, to be allowed to return and continue his propaganda with impu- nity, I deem it advisable to take action on Shaik Tsa's letter, backed as it is bv public opinion. Shaik Salman representing Shaik Isa and K. B. Muhammad Sharif representing myself have therefore gone ofi to the steamer to inform Mulla Hafiz that the ruler's request that he be forbidden to land has been acceded to, He has no property here nor means of livelihood otherwise than his post in the school from which he is dismissed, and so no necessity to come here. I trust that you will appiove in the action taken by me in this matter, ihere was not suffi cient time to refer to you. S erial N o. 8.

Tyranny of SJiaiJc of Bahrain and his family over Bahrain subjects. In continuation of my telegram No. 107, dated 15th January on the subject of the tyranny of the Shaik of Bahrain and his family, I have the honour to state, for the information of the Government of India, that the Political Agent reports that the Shaik of Bahrain, apparently egged on by Shaik Jabir bin Subah, brother of the notorious Shaik Hamud, recently made an attempt to trump un a case against Haji Ali, one of the members of the deputation who complained to m3 on December 21st. The report goes into considerable detail, and I do not think it will be necessary to trouble the Government of India with it; it appears that some words were insert ed in a letter sent by Haji Ali to the headman of his village, with a view to putting Haji Ali in the wrong and trying to drag in Khan Bahadur Mohammed Sharif, the head of the Persian community. The Bahrain subjects were seriously alarmed and many of them came to the Agency to ask what the result of their former peti tion was, and to ask for protection. The political Agent by judicious handling of Shaik Salman, who is the son of Shaik Hamad, the heir-apparent, and now acting for his father, got the latter to prove to Shaik Isa that the whole matter was trumped up, and to put the Shaik ofi pressing it,. A curious feature of the affair was that byway of prelude a gang who have not been identified had for several nights lain up outside Manameh and fired heavily -on the police posts on the outskirts of the town ; as no attempt was made to commit robberies or other crimes this was evidently done to frighten the police and inhabitants. Shaik Salman asked the Political Agent's advice and the latter told him it was evidently a put-up thing and advised him to tell Shaik Isa that the Political Agent thought it was an intrigue on the part of someone who should know better which would doubtless be discovered when the police caught one of the -offenders. That night the inhabitants of Manameh who had guns lent them to the police and hundreds of volunteers turned out to assist. The attackers no doubt got wind of this and forthwith ceased their activities. They were not many in number, as far as can be ascertained, but got rid of a great deal of ammunition. They were seen to have come over at dusk by boat from Moharraq, and the Political Agent was informed that one of Shaik Abdulla's fidawis (armed retainers) was recognized among them. As Shaik Abdulla is the only person who could have any possible object in such a disturbance, the Political Agent thinks this points to his complicity. In any case, these two affairs show how very bad the Shaik's Government of Bahrain is, and point to the necessity of taking some steps to improve the situa tion. (C456JFJ)14 Serial No. 10.

I think there can be little doubt that Shaik Abdullajs at the bottom of these affairs, and that best way to quiet matters would be to insist on Shaik Isa agreeing to deport him as was done in the case of Sh?,.ik Ali bin Ahmed in 1905, and hope that Government will be pleased to give this proposal their serious consideration.

A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I beg to forward herewith for your information a petition which was sent to me to-day. As I was not in a position to give them a reply, I stated that I would forward it to you. As I deemed it better that it should not be translated in my office for fear of possible persecution of the signatories should their names be dis closed, I have made a translation which I attach. Since the submission of my Nos. 12-C. and 13-C., the Shaiks have ceased persecuting Haji Ali, but last night there was an attack by four armed men on a policeman just behind the Agency between here and the American Mission. The policeman was shot through the chest, but was taken to the Mission Hospital and the wound has not proved fatal. This morning a Bahraini from the village of Jidhafs reported that he had seen four armed men in Jidtafj just after dark. They had hidden their faces with their ' Chafiehs ' and could not be recognised and when he spoke to them they told him to mind his own business. It is probable that they were the men concerned in the affair which took place a few hours later. It is signi ficant that Jidhafs is under the direct rule of Shaik Abdulla. The policeman says he fired three rounds and one of his assailants fell but rose again and they all ran away. Shaik Salman discussed the matter to-day m the Municipal Council and expressed the opinion that it was a deliberately ' put up ' affair. The meeting agreed, and it was obvious from remarks made that everyone was of opinion that Abdulla is the cause of the mischief. Means of preventing recurrences were dis cussed, but no definite decision come to, as it is evident that however much the police force be increased, it will always be possible for such premeditated attacks to be made on dark nights. It would seem that Shaik Abdulla has chosen to follow in the footsteps of his bin Ahmad, and to stop at nothing. There is now no room for doubt that there will be no peace here until he has been sinjilarly removed from the scene oi nis activities. Enclosure No. 2 to Serial No. 10.

We also senta petition to Busliire to His Excellency the Political Resident. We have not vet heard any result, which will pacify our apprehensions and the oppression and tyranny of the rulers increases. Although the whole family of al Khalifeh oppres- sions, yet they are not all alike. Before affairs were in the hands of Shaik Abdulla oppression was rife, but when he came to conduct affairs officially, tyrannv was practised to such an extent that matters affecting our honour were not safe (implies that womenkind were not safe) and he even took girls from their houses by force and her father and mother from fear could not speak. Now Shaik Abdulla is officially not conducting affairs, but behind the scenes he continues with his former power, and more and does not relax his efforts. The reason for this is that Shaik Esa, his father, and his mother like him and assist him m what he wants to do, and Shaik Esa is to-day no more than a ring on Abdulla's tmger. He helps him in whatever he wants. We beg Your Excellency to deliver us from the tyranny of Shaik Abdulla and other oppression. We be^ vou in the name of the prophet Jesus to deliver us as soon as possible from the hands of tins tyrant. We have no more patience to endure. You are responsible to (jrod, for jour welfare.

I beg to report that a few days back I visited Shaik Esa in Muharraq. He appeared to be very anxious to effect an improvement in the relation between bhaik Abdulla and myself. I him every encouragement and said that Abdulla well knew that if ne mended his ways, I should not let his past affect our friendly telations in any way. Abdulla professed that he would do everything possible to please Hamad and myself, but he was so loud in his assertions that he had neveridone anything wrong nor been guilty of any oppression, that little reliance can be placed in him. He has made similar announcements several times before and failed to act up to his avowed intentions. following day Shaik Hamad told me that the night before the interview he had been sent for by Abdulla and Shaik Esa and asked to admit in mv presence, that he was very pleased with Abdulla's behaviour. He said that to refuse meant an open quarrel and as a matter of policy he agreed to do his best to appear pleased. Shaik Hamad said that he is doubtful of Abdulla's intentions, and is anxious that Government should know the situation, and in the event of future trouble not accuse him of double-dealings. He therefore handed me a letter wmch he begged me to keep private, as its exposure would mean much trouble for him m the family, but which he asked me to shew you. I attach a trans lation.

You heard what my brother said yesterday in the presence of my honoured father, that in future he would not oppose me, and I sincerely hope he will keep his word, which will be patent from results. Nevertheless I think it incumbent on me as a precaution for the future, to explain to you the situation so that I may be free from blame if he (Abdulla) does not keep his word.

No. 209-S., dated Bushire, the llth (received the 20th) March 1922. From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor , C .S .I., C .I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Subject.—Ojop'mzon of his subjects by the ShaiJc of Bahrain and his family. With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram No. 119-S,, dated 30th Januaiy regarding the oppression of Bahrain subjects by the Shaik and his family, I have the honour to report as follows. On receipt of your abovementioned telegram I consulted the Political Agent, Bahrain, as to the best method of delivering the warning to the Shaik. The Political Agent suggested that in order to differentiate the visit from an ordinary visit of inspection and to make it more impressive the ' Lawrence ' might be accompanied by one of His Majesty's ships. I agreed that this would be a good thing. Owing, however, to the fact that no ship was available till the middle of February and that after that H. M. S. ' Cyclamen the only ship in the Gulf, was required elsewhere, my visit had to be deferred till the 1st March and then postponed till the 7th March. This turned out to be a good thing for two reasons, firstly because the Bahrainis made a successful demonstration against the oppression of the Shaik's family early in February, and secondly, because when my visit was postponed Shaik^Abdulla heard about it and ran away with the idea that drastic action was about to be taken against him, and before it actually took place became thoroughly frightened. He called on the Political Agent and implored his assistance ; Major Daly replied that he saw inadequate grounds for interfering. Finally, Shaik Abdulla wrote a letter admitting his opposition to Shaik Hamad and to the Agency, promising to mend his wa} s in the future and declaring that he would do all in his power to please Government in future. &lt;{ ^ matter was thus almost settled before I arrived on the 7th in K T M S. 1 Lawrence ' accompanied by H.M.S. ' Cyclamen '. The Shaik paid the usual \isit to me on board the ' Lawrence ' and received his salute on leaving After I had returned his call at his ' mujlis ' room over the Customs, and all his relatives an ot ler people had left, T gave Shaik Esa a warning on the lines of your telegram men ^uer a JO\e. n view of the fact that the Bahrainis had already made a suc cessful demonstration, Shaik Esa has at last realized that he is in a dangerous portion, and the warning carried additional weight. Shaik Abdulla was then called m and warned that if he continued his recent behaviour he would certainly get into trouble He made all sorts of protestations regarding his intention to urn o\er a new ea and try and work with Agency and please the Government17 and really seemed m earnest. As the T*olitical Agent Iiad previously informed me that he considered and that the general opinion among leading people was, that Shaik Abdulla was thoroughly frightened, and would not be likely to give trouble, at all events for some time, and that it was not necessary to get him out of Bah rain, I did not make the suggestion that he should go on the ' Haj An additional reason for not doing so was because I found that Shaik Abdulla had been largely instrumental in getting the Shaik to accept the Babrainis' proposals, and was urging His Excellency to adopt a more progressive policy, and as Abdulla' is almost the only person who can get the Shaik to do things, it seemed better, if Abdulla really acts up to his promise, to let him stay in Bahrain. I accordingly told him that he must give some proof that he means to help and suggested that a reform of the arrangements for deciding pearling cases would be a good way of showing his good faith. He promised to take this matter in hand. Later on I saw Shaik Hamad at the Agency and warned him in the presence of the Political Agent on the lines of your telegram mentioned above ; 1 added that I expected him to take a firm line with the A1 I\halifa family and prevent oppression by it and thus show his capacity for ruling ; he said he would do so, and was determined to do his best to prove his suitability to succeed his father. I attach an extract from a memorandum from the Political Agent givm^ an account of the Bahrainis' demonstration for the information of the Government of India. % I hope that Shaik Esa has at last realized his position and that Shaik Abdulla has received a lesson and will behave better in future. I trust the Government of India will agree that, in view of his apologies to the Political Agent and assur ances of good behaviour, it was unnecessary to call upon Shaik Abdulla to do the ' Haj ' at the present time.

This action considerably frightened the Shaiks. Shaik Esa sent Shaik Hamad to me to ask how he should deal with the situation I declined officially to interfere but unofficially .told Hamad that they would be most unwise to further force the situation and should try to find means of pacify ing the people. The outcome was that Qosaibi, Yusuf Kanoo and Muhammad Sharif were asked to go with some representatives of the Bahrainis to interview the Shaiks. The Bahrainis made several demands, which after about two days' delay and a meeting of all al Khalifeh, were granted bv Shaik Esa with the excep tion of one, which referred to a religious tax on Shiahs. The Shaik at first made several stupid alterations in the conditions, purely with the object of saving his face and appearing not to give way to the Bahrainis, but finally modified them. 1 understand that the Bahrainis demanded the following points which were conceded, though whether they will be carried out is another matter. 1. No one except the ruler and Shaik Hamad, to decide cases or to have the right to punish in any way. 2. Cases which Shaik Hamad cannot decide to the satisfaction of both parties to be referred by him to the Shara, Majlis Al Urfi, or Salifeh as the case may be. 3. No one to be dragged oil to the ruler's court without notice, but to be served with a summons signed by Shaik Hamad. 4. Documents concerning gardens leased to subjects by the Ruling family to be in duplicate, a copy in possession of each party, and to be witnessed by independent witnesses. No conditions other than written in the document to be enforced. C4o6FD6. Steps to be taken to stop the Shaik's camels being allowed to enter and graze in private gardens. 6. ' Sukrah ' of donkeys to cease. 7. The practice of placing calves belonging to the ruling family with Bahraini bakers to fatten free of chaige, to cease. 8. The prison to be put in proper order and a reasonable house provided for the same. It is reported that Shaik Abdulla was helpful in obtaining these concessions for the Bahrainis. If this is really so, it may be an indication that he means to turn a new leaf. , Serial No. 17. No. 304-S., dated Bushire, the 14th (received the 24tli) April 1922. From—The Hon'ble Lieutexaxt-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Subject.— Proposed reforms in taxation at Bahrain. With reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 209 -S., dated the 11th March 1922, regarding affairs at Bahrain, I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India a copy of a report which I have received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, on the subject of the readiness of the Shaik to effect reforms. This report has only just been received and I think it advisable to send it on by to-day s mail to save a week, and I am therefore unable to deal with the matter in detail. Major Daly has, however, reported very fully, and it is therefore un necessary for me to do so. The Shaik apparently desires to introduce a fair scheme of taxation outlined under heads 1 to 4 on the 3rd page of Major Daly's letter. He is however afraid of the Suni tribes, which for some time past have not borne their full share of taxa tion. Ihe Shaik desires to know whether he could expect support from Govern ment in the event of his introducing the necessary reforms. His advisers think that if the local population knew the reforms were being introduced with the ap proval of Government, they would raise no difficulty about paying the taxes. The Political Agent is inclined to agree with this. Shaik Abdulla suggested that the best way of doing this would be for the Shaik to announce the reforms at a proposed meeting at which I was present, and I could then say that the reforms were approved by Government. I now beg to enquire whether the Government of India will be pleased to author ize me to say that they approve of the reforms in taxation and will surport the Shaik in introducing them provided they are levied fairly and equally all round without discrimination or preferential treatment. If the Government of India decide to give some measure of support I agree with the Political Agent that the Shaik might be required to set aside a sum annually for works of public utility. I should be glad if I may be favoured with telegraphic instructions as to what atti tude should be adopted, as I propose to visit Bahrain at the end of my next tour early next month and the Shaik will certainly raise the question. I must apologize for this letter having been written somewhat hurriedly 1o catch the mail, and I have therefore been unable to summarize the Political Agent's rittThi7wiute r excL m d! ke ^ ^ Self - cwltoined - ln ^ circumstances.. Enclosure to Serial No. 17. No. 70-C., dated Bahrain, the 11th April 1922. From— Major C. K. Daly, I. A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report on tlie present circumstances of tlie Bahrain Government. Since your visit to Bahrain last month., a considerable cliange appears to have taken place in the attitude of the Shaiks towards the Agency. They have sought my advice in a variety of matters, and show what appears to be a genuine desire to introduce some reforms. I am informed, by persons who have an intimate know ledge of their attitude in the past, that this inclination is quite unprecedented, and from the record of the Agency, this would appear to be correct. I have long been in the confidence of Shaik Hamad bin Esa, but recently both lie and Shaik Abdulla (who appears to have mended, his ways) have frequently sought my advice and have explained to me the difficulties of Shaik Esa's position which they admit past misrule has brought about. They have been compelled by recent events to realize that such tyrannical rule as they have exercised in the past is, with the spread of democratic ideas, bound to come to an end. The unrest and disturbances among the indigenous Shiah population has been fully reported previously. As a result of oppression, they were becoming increasingly restive and the warning delivered by you to the ruler, to the effect that he could not expect assistance in the event of disturbances, was not without effect upon him. Shaiks Hamad and Abdulla made efforts to pacify the Bahrainis, but unfortunately, junior members of the Shaik family and his brother Khalid continued to perform acts of oppression. . Parties of Bahrainis were continually coming to the Agency with complaints and frequently refused to go away, preferring to pass the night grouped around the flagstaff. Such situations were not devoid of difficulty. On one recent occasion, a further act of oppression by one of Shaik Khalid's sons, caus ed some fifteen hundred persons to appear at the Agency. They refused to leave and to lay their grievances before the ruler, as I suggested. Since their numbers were being constantly added to by fresh arrivals, I decided to send for Shaiks Hamad and Abdulla to endeavour to arrive at a settlement. The Shaiks interviewed a deputation from the crowd, and undertook to instruct Shaik Khalid to cease interference with liberty of persons and to postpone collection of taxes until further orders. They promised that, in the meantime, they would consider the whole question of taxation, and the administration of justice, and would request Shaik Esa to make an announcement later. On my recommend ation, the crowd accepted these assurances and dispersed. After this there follow ed a series of discussions at which I was asked to advise. It was pointed out to me thai they (Shaiks) desired to introduce reforms and wished to substitute rea sonable and just taxation, for the obnoxious taxes hitherto forced from the Shi ah s. I learnt that, apart from the customs, the revenue of the Shaiks, has been derived as follows :— 1. Date garden tax. Collected quite arbitrarily, according to the whim and appetite for oppression of the particular Shaikling within whose area the garden exists. Practically collected from Shias only. 2. 4 Raqabieh', literally c neck tax ' or poll tax, levied on males, at varying rates in different localities. It has been collected from Shiahs only and is particularly obnoxious to them. 3. Fish tax. Levied from Shiahs only at varying rates. 4. A special tax on Shiahs during Muharram. 5. A variety of taxes collected in kind from Shiahs only. 6. A pearling tax. This was originally collected from all pearling boats, which are mainly owned by Sunnis. Of late years a large number of the boat owners have ceased paying. A similar tax is collected by the rulers of Kowait, Qatar, etc., and is the acknowledged .right of the Shaik. nMy advice was asked as to tlie form reasonable future taxation miglit take. After several discussions and sounding of local opinion, the lollowmg scheme..for taxes was thought feasible— 1 Date tax of 1-1 Oth on gardens watered by flow, and l-20th on those watered by lift, to be collected uniformly. This tax is admissible under Shara' law. 2. Fish tax of 1-1 Oth on fish caught in the local fish traps, and l-20th on fish caught otherwise. 3. Abolition of' Eaqabieh' and all other taxes on Shiahs, and substitute therefor a very light ground tax for all houses, other than those in the towns of Manameh and Muharraq, which pay n unicipal taxes. To be collected without religious distinction. Details, which need not be gone into in this report, were discussed at length. 4. The impartial collection of the existing pearling tax. The above scheme would be acceptable to the Bahrainis, but the Sunni tribes might not be agreeable, as they have been permitted to consider themselves prac tically immune from taxation. I was sounded as to whether the ruler could expect support'from Government, in the event of his introducing necessary reforms, should there be disinclination on the part of the Sunnis to accept them. I naturally gave no answer to this, and it is to request instructions on this matter that this report is w r ritten. To summarize—• 1. If the Shaiks, as in the past, seek to oppress the Shiahs to compensate themselves for their inability, or disinclination, to collect taxes from the Sunnis, they will be faced with continual disturbances, in which, I am of opinion, we shall sooner or later be involved. 2. If they forego most of the revenue from the Shiahs, they w T ill inevitably become bankrupt in the near future, and we may be faced with the necessity of taking over their affairs, as was the case in Muscat. I learn from several sources that Shaik Esa is a good deal in debt privately. It is believed he is also indebted to his Director of Cus toms. Shaik Abdulla is in debt and Shaik Hamad has informed me in confidence that he also is in debt and that his liabilities are steadily increasing, particularly as he is now unable to collect full revenue from Shiahs from fear of disturbances. 3. If the Shaiks attempt to introduce the proposed forms of taxation, the Surnns may be expected to object. Should this be the case the Bahrainis would follow suit, and no collections whatever would be possible. To overcome this possibility it has been suggested to me,, and I am inclined to concur, that it would only be necessary for it to be made clear to the leaders of both Sunnis and Shiahs, that the scheme was introduced with the knowledge and approval of yourself. It would then probably be accepted without difficulty, though it might be necessary to convey that the ruler would be supported if necessary. Shaik Abdulla suggested that this might be effected by the ruler making an announcement to a public meeting at which you were present, and to which you might add Government's approval of the reforms. ♦ It would seem that if we afford this support we might, not unreasonably, require the ruler to improve his administration and to set aside an annual sum for works of public utility. Although the collection of revenue is momentarily at a standstill and the Shaiks are at a loss as to what to do, I have advised them not to hasten matters without mature reflection, but to strengthen their position, and favourably impress their subjects, by the commencement of some ordered administration. They have21 agreed to this, and issued orders for the opening of a Government office with two regular clerks for dealing with public business, and for the establishment of a regular court for the disposal of cases among their subjects, in which a rough record of pro ceedings will be kept. These improvements, together with some others are being strongly demanded by public opinion. The matter of taxation is temporarily postponed, but is bound to arise again in the course of the next few weeks. I request that I may be instructed as to the attitude I should adopt in the matter.

Bahrain Reforms. With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram No. 851-S., dated the 24th June, on the subject of the proposed reforms at Bahrain I have the honour to report that matters remain in statu quo and it now seems unlikely that the Shaikhs will seriously attempt any reform unless driven to it by rebellion on the part of the Bahrainis. 2. The reasons for this are as follows : — The Shaikhs expressed their original desire for reform shortly before Ramzan and Ramzan had started when Foreign and Political Department telegram No. 549-S., dated the 2nd May was received. In Ramzan, especially if the fast occurs during the hot weather, no one does much in Bahrain and needless to say nothing was attempted during the month. By the end of Ramzan the Shaikhs' desire for reforms had fizzled out to a great extent. Another reason is that a few months before the Dowasir, a powerful tribe of Sunni Arabs who reside at Budaiya and the neighbourhood on the north-west corner of the main island and fit out a lot of boats for the pearl fisheries, sent a deputation to the Sultan of Nejd. The latter received the deputation well and is said to have promised them his support. This has frightened the Shaikhs as they have a great dread of Bin Sa'ud and the Akhwan, and now that they think the Dowasir will have Bin Sa'ud behind them in resisting reforms which touch their pockets, it is very unlikely that any reforms will be attempted, unless, as I have remarked above, they ire forced on the Shaikhs by pressure of events. Serial No. 29. No. 529-S., dated Bushire, the 16th (received the 25th) July 1922. From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. Resident in the Persian Gulf. P. Trevor, C.S.I. C.I.E., Political Reforms in Bahrain. With reference to the telegram No. 915-S., dated the 10th July 1922, on the subject of the proposed reforms in Bahrain, I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India a copy of a letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain on the subject. 2. In this letter Major Daly gives all available information about the visit of the Shaikh of the Dowasir to Bin Sa'ud except its date and I am making further enquiries about this. When Bin Sa'ud was at Hasa the Shaikh of Qatar went to see him and some of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs sent presents. In the correspond ence regarding the destruction of a tower at Ajman m 1921 : I reported that the Shaikh of that place had sent a deputation. Bin Sa'ud in fact is the most imposing personality among the Arabs of these parts and all the petty Shaikhs and tribes of the coast like to keep in with him as far as possible. Most of the Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast fear the Akhwan and abhor their tenets but deem it advisable to22 i make friends with the mammon of unrighteousness— this phrase is perhaps inappropriate as the Akhwan consider themselves highly righteous— and be on the safe side. It will be seen that Bin Sa'ud appears to have told the Dowasir Shaikhs that he would either {a) use his influence to support them in the event of their deciding to resist taxation or (b) give them suitable habitat so that they could threaten to leave Bahrain, and do so if necessary. 3. It may not be out of place to mention that this threat of leaving Bahrain is an old plank in the Dowasir platform which they have used with success for years before Bin Sa'ud came to the front. I well remember telling Shr.ikh Isa when I was at Bahrain that such threats were all bluff and that they would never quit the valuable lands and houses they have in Bahrain, but that, if by any chance they were foolish enough to do so, he could easily get other people to occupv the lands and villages. But Shaikh Isa in addition to being very obstinate is exceed ingly pusillanimous and timid and has always feared the Dowasir and allowed them to bounce him. By threats of this sort they obtained the discontinuance of the small diving tax mentioned by the Political Agent. 4. It will be seen that the Political Agent points out that there will be a great difference if the reforms are introduced voluntarily by the Shaikh or under pressure by us. In the latter case, as Major Daly says, everything will be the subject of great criticism, and we should have to be very careful to make certain that any reform we suggest would effectively remove the cause for grievance Major Daly accordingly asks for time to study the present state of taxation and the nature and effect of 'improvements which could be introduced. He suggests at he could go mto the matter with less chance of causing a stir at the conclusion of the pearling season I agree with him on both these points, and beg to suggest that I may be allowed to defer the submission of reasoned proposals for reforms until the autumn after Major Daly has had time to study the present system 1 Tfd S system) and incidence of taxation, and go into the question of justice between Sunnis and Shiahs at the conclusion of the pearling season. and l Oll0pe the Go y ernment of India will concur with this view fhp ] A submission of reasoned proposals to be deferred. This letter, like e Political Agent s, has had to be written hurriedly to catch the mail so I trust any deficiencies will be excused. Copy forwarded to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Inq. Enclosure to Serial No. 29. No. 111-C., dated Bahrain, the 13th July 1922. From -major C. K. Daly , LA., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject -.—Bahrain Affairs.. In reply to your telegram No. 1218, I beg to report as follows : A % alr ® ad 5 sported the Shaikh of the Dowasir together with one Ahmpd -il tiahej the headmen of another small Sunni tribe and a notorious iXi^! me ago visited Ibn Sa ud. It is of course not possible to be certain of^vW place, but Shaikh Hamad bin Easa told me in confidence what he had Wnt ^ I abo heard from another well informed source. It would appear that ^ 1 offered to assist them to resist any efforts of the Bahrain Rulers to Hx fh ^ to bring them under their effective control. He is said to Wo L • 1 ^ em ' cr natives —(1) to use his influence to support them should they resis^the R, ? alter ' i they preferred (2) provide them with a suitable habitat in order that ^ threaten to leave Bahrain, and in fact, do so if necessary. 7 Tww : T Th0 ' 8h recognize Shaikh Hamad as his definite successor.' It is beiieved t^Uhev ^ ed some hopes of gettmg control of the ilands into their own hands'L Thei msssmm ^3 Bin Sa'ud may te not unaware of these designs. Some years ago tliey used to pay a small diving tax in a commuted form. Even then, they resisted direct taxation. For several years they have ceased even these payments, and the Ruler is afraid to insist on them. In the past the Ruler has relied on the Do wash and other Sunni tribes to enable him to overawe the Shiah Bahrainis and they were always allowed a free hand in their dealings with Shiahs. Last year when the Bahrainis became increasingly restive, they repeatedly pressed on Shaikh Hamad the necessity for taking repres sive measures. The Shaikhs, howevei. , were thoroughly alarmed and afraid to push matters to the extent advocated by the Dowasir. The latter asked permission to deal with certain sections of the Bahrainis themselves, but Shaikh Hamad refused. His own position owing to Abdulla's intrigues was delicate, and he was aware that if disorders resulted he might be held responsible and Abdulla would make much of the situation. The Dowasir bitterly criticised this attitude, but were also afraid to take the law into their hands, since they distrust the Shaikhs, and suspected that, should their action cause disorders the blame would be placed upon them to clear the Shaikhs. They have since frequently tried to force Shaikh Hamad's hand by picking quarrels with the Bahrainis, an example of which was the Barbar affair 'which was reported at the time. This matter has never been settled. Although they dare not admit it, the Rulers know that the Dowasir deliberately instigated the affair. They would gladly saciifice the Bahrainis to placate the Dowasir who continue to press for ' redress ' but are afraid that such action would cause a revolt among the Shiahs. They therefore continually delay a full enquiry. It is probable that the recent more determined attitude of the Bahrain Shiaha to rid themselves of oppression is displeasing to Bin Sa'ud. I suspect this from the attitude of his agent here in the matter. Bin Sa'ud has Shiah subjects at Qatif who are closely connected with the Bahrainis and whom he taxes out of all propor tion to their wealth. Reports have once or twice been received that they were inclined to resent the treatment and on one occasion which was reported to you and to the High Commissioner for Iraq, they attempted to approach me, but were discouraged as we had no desire to interfere in the affairs of the Sultan of Nejd. Also it is becoming increasingly apparent that Bin Sa'ud is anxious to have a hand in Bahrain affairs. The same attitude has, I believe, been [noticed by the Political Agent, Kuwait in regard to that place. It would therefore be in his interests if the in efficient administration of Bahrain continues, enabling him to make secret alliances with independent factions such as the Dowasir. Reforms, entailing equitable taxation means support to the Bahrain Government to enable them to control equally the Sunni and Shiah tribes. The Dowasir have been settled so long in Bahrain that they are recognised as Bahrain subjects. In their relations with the Shaikhs they do not enjoy the good offices of the Agency, as is the case with all recognised subjects of Bin Sa'ud. Since they are, however, virtually independent they have no need for such assistance. f The Rulers of Bahrain have recently adopted a somewhat more just attitude towards the Shiahs, probably as a result of the warning given by Government, but •quite recently they appear to be testing their power again in this respect, and as in accordance with the instructions of Government, I have^ scrupulously avoided interference, they are inclined to gain confidence. The Bahrainis on the other hand are divided, and'some of the leaders are discouraged at having obtained no support from His Majesty's Government as a result of appeals, whereas others advocate open rebellion should oppression again increase and are reported to have imported arms. The Sunni tribes are almost all pearling nakhudas. Great oppression exists in the pearl diving, and the majority of the oppressed are Shiahs and under British protection, being foreign Arabs or Persians. The Sunni tribes resent all xeforms, lest a small beginning should lead to reforms also in the diving. I would point out that whereas reforms introduced by the Shaikhs, might be a good thing even if imperfectly devised and inefficiently carried out, it will be different matter if they are introduced under pressure from His Majesty's Govern ment. In that even every possible flaw will be discovered and exploited. Before embarking on such a policy I would therefore respectfully suggest that I may be24 given sufficient time to make a more careful study of the present state of taxation and the nature 'did effect of improvements which could be effected particularly those originally ?ug^ested by the Shaikhs. It would place us in a most invidious position to insist on reforms if in practice they did not adequately remove cause for grievance. Apart from the question of taxation is the more crying need for some system which will ensure justice as between Sunnis and Shiahs, lor this is the grievance which is most likely to react on opinion in neighbouring Shiah countries. We are now in the pearling season and any enquiries now made, however circumspect, will arouse the greatest suspicion among the Sunni pearlers. I believe that after the close of the season a full study of these matters could be made without causing a stir. Also, as already reported I am just finishing negotiations which it is hoped will result in a reconciliation between Shaikhs Abdulla and Hamad. It would be advisable to test Abdulla's attitude for some little time. If he proves that he is genuinely prepared to assist Hamad the introduction of reforms would be to some extent simplified. Otherwise, regrettable though it will be, we shall be compelled first to deal with him, for he would join forces with the Sunni tribes against Hamad to oppose refgrms and discord among the ruling family would again result and render effective control by them an impossibility. This report has been written in great haste in order to catch the mail, and I beg that its involved nature may be overlooked. I trust that all essential points are however dealt with.

Subject :— Bahrain reforms. In my letter 529-8.4 dated 16th July 1922, I asked leave to send in my considered proposals regarding the Reforms in Bahrain after the close of the pearling season. I would have submitted my views to you earlier had I not received last month your memorandum No. 3661j-1126-Est. A ,§ of the 5th December, in which you referred to the Reforms as having ' now lapsed indefinitely. ' This reached me on my return from a visit to Bahrain where I had been to discuss the question with the Political Agent ; and I was on the point of closing a letter to you asking for the orders of the Grovernnaent of India in view of that announcement when I received your memorandum No. 33-82-Ext. A., 1| dated 10th January 1923, reminding me that my proposals were still awaited. I have the honour now to acquaint Government with my views on the present situation in Bahrain. 2. The position of affairs is no better than when I last addressed you. During the past few months, the oppression of the Bahrainis by the Sheikh and the members of his numerous family has seriously in creased ; and is giving lise to deep discontent with the ruling family and as we are inevitably associated with the Sheikh's despotic rule—-more and more criticism of our connivance at the victimization of his Shiah subjects. The Political Agent reports that a leading Bahraini, Ahmad al Khamis, himself a victim of persecution a few years ago, recently visited him, and after express ing disappointment at Government's inaction, assured him that the Shiahs were convinced their only hope cf relief lay in a vigorous Press agitation. There is some reason to believe, too, that in pressing their old claim to the possession of Bahrain as they are doing at present, the Persian Government are influenced by the complaints of Bahraivis of whom, as Government are aware, there are large communities in Lingah, Bundar Abbas, and Mohammerah. All this merely confirms the opinion of the Poreign Office, w T bich you quoted in your telegram 1 ^ cf the 10th July last, that for the sake of the well-being of the Sliiah population, and of our good name, the administration of Bahrain is in great need of improvement. 3. The reforms which Western Standards might suggest as desirable are numerous ; but it is not necessary to consider for the purpose of practical politics, more than the minimum necessary for the removal of the most flagrant abuses. These are («) The inequality of taxation as between Sunnis who evade all pay ment at present, and Shiahs. To remedy this the introduction of an equitable system of taxation is called for.36 (b) The liability of Shiabs to imprisonment and any other punishment at the mere whim of the ruler and his family without any kind of legal sanction: a state of things vdiich demands the introduc tion of a regular judicial system. (c) The complete disregard of the diving rules, and the resulting injustice to the divers who are at the mercy of the Nakhudas especially in the matter of their accounts. ' The observance of the rules, proper maintenance of accounts, and their nrodurfinn before some impartial tribunal, must be enforced. 4. The creation of machinery suitable for the purpose of carrvino- out such reforms would be a comparatively simple matter. But before'entering upon details, it appears to me advisable to examine the consequencfes which their introduction is likely to involve in the conditions at present rulin^ in B ihrain, which make the problem more difficult of solution than when Govern ment last considered the question. 5. The difference lies in the increased obstinacy and obstructiveness of Sheikh Isa himself. When I delivered the Government of India warning to him in March 1922, he was thoroughly alarmed by the demonstrations of the Baharainis, and by the fear that drastic action was going to be taken. His fears speedily wore off when, he found that nothing happened, and the question of reforms was not pressed. Since then his character seems to be steadily deteriorating, owing no doubt to increasing age. Though physically he appears to be in sound health, mentally he is in his dotage. Completely dominated bv an ignorant and despotic wife, he is utterly opposed to change of any sort except such as will directly increase his income without adding to his responsi bilities. As an example of the old man's ' intransigeance ' Major Daly reports that the Municipality of Manameh have been trying in vain 'for the last two years to secure his consent to a scheme for the supplv of water and electric power to the town. The whole Municipal Council supported by nearly all the notables and both his sons approached him recently and begged him to give his approval. Though he was not asked to contribute in any way to the cost of the undertaking, and was even offered a royalty on the water, he resolutely refused to a^ree, and would assign no reason for his refusal which is depriving the inhabitants of much needed benefits As an example of his credulity and ignorance Major Daly mentions the follow ing;— The roads near Manameh are being repaired and Major Daly procured some old rails discarded by the Army for use for small bridges. The Sheikh refused to allow these to be used on the ground they were Government property, and Government would claim the ground they were in I 6. If such is his attitude to schemes of purely material progress urged ou him by his own family and subjects ; it can be supposed that there is no hope whatsoever that the Sheikh will ever agree, save under strong compulsion, to the introduction of administrative changes which he would regard not as reform but as reaction, and which are desired only by the Shiahs, and by the Britsih Government. Indeed such is his intractability that it is extremely doubtful whether even strong moral compulsion would induce him to agree. A year ago, a hint of Government's severe displeasure would probably have moved him. I do not think it is likely to do so now. And if that tailed, it would have to be lollowed up by a show of material force, or by a tightening of moral pressure- ending ultimately (for 1 can see no alternative) in the threat of deposition if he A\eie lo continue in an attituoe of passive resistance. In all human probability such a threat would bring the Sheikh, and his wife, to their senses ; but, if it did not, Government would have no choice but to carry out its threat, and that could only be done by a resort to force, however embarrassing the circumstances. In fact, once it is decided to bring pressure to bear, it becomes impossible to guarantee that Government will be able to stop short at any particular point of moral or physical compulsion. It follows that if Government are determined to put a stop to the abuses in Bahrain, they must bo prepared to impose the Beforms upon the37 Shpikh • to support their introdujtion if necessary with material force (whether feheiim , to supp the acfc . aal deposition o£ the ruler) ; ^ an^to nieet the criticism which is hound to be levelled a-ainst us hy and finally to m et stron' line.

To sum up, my opinion is as follows : (i) The state of affairs in Bahrain calls for reform more urgently than ever. (ii) But in his present mood the Sheikh may not yield even to strong moral pressure; and Government must be prepared to back up moral pressure by material force if they are determined to carry through the Reforms. (Hi) Forcible intervention is bound to attract hostile criticism; but so too is inaction; and at any rate the former has the merit of achiev ing some good, while the latter may be merely putting off the evil da/.Telegram R., No. 1090, dated lOth (received lltli) June 1922.

Consul, Bunder Abbas, reports Karguzars of Lingah and Bunder .Abbas have received instructioas from Ministry for Foreign Affairs that Bahreinis are to be considered Persian subjects and by way of giving effect to tbis they are refusing to allow any to leave Persia without taking out Persian passports. T have instructed Consul to inform Babreinis that if local authorities insist they had better take out passports under protest. This attitude of Ministry for Foreign Affairs is curiously at variance with that of Customs Department which considers Bahrein foreign as regards port charges duty, etc., and prosecutes persons caught smuggling. Last year Customs asked for and obtained my co operation in trying to prevent smuggling from Bahrein and the Director told me it was of considerable assistance to them. Arrangement has of course been dropped now as Persians cannot have it both ways. Seeing that Persians were finally driven out of Bahrein in 17*3 and in view of their absolute incapacity to re-occupy islands now their present attitude seems rather childish. I do not know however if present is propitious moment for taking matter up. Serial No. 2. ± _ n _ a - i- • No. 470-S., dated Bushire, the 25th June (received 5th July) 1922.

As formerly the Post office in Bahrein was British, and they stamped as foreign letters, etc., which were sent to Bahrein, recently following the sup pression of the Southern Post offices which the British had established from the time of the war, the Post office of Bahrein has also been suppressed, and it is understood that a Post office under Persian superintendence is to be established. Therefore letters, etc., will be stamped as for the interior of Persia. Note hy Editor. —In truth, the matter of Bahrein has become a strange affair. It neither appears to be part of the Persian Empire, nor to be a depend ency of the British, nor of the Arabs. All that we know is this that the Persian Government has neither an official representative there, nor has sent a Governor there, nor are its departments in Persian hands, nor even, if it is foreign territory, has a Consul been despatched there, so that the rights of 30,000 Persians settled in Bahrein may not be at the mercy of the designs of the Political Agents and their instruments. In this connection we have written lengthy articles in our paper, and repeatedly written official letters to ^Enclosure of Serial No. 5. f Serial No. 5.3 the necessary high quarters, and drawn the attention of the GoYernment : unfortunately up to the present there has been no effect. Now, if a Persian post office is to be established in Bahrein, it is a great step forward, and everyone, particularly the Persians resident in Bahrein, will be able to a certain extent to have confidence in the Government to which he belongs. Therefore it is necessary for some experienced, upright and suitable person, like (not like ?) those other Persians who have been serving the British there and inflicted every kind of annoyance on people, should be appointed as inspector for the directorship of the post office there. A number of the inhabitants of the ports, and particularly those with connections in Bahrein have proposed Mr. Pajuh, who is one of the best, most upright and competent postal officials, for this office. We hope that the Government will pay special attention to this, and at least heal the w r ounded hearts of the Persians resident in Bahrein by this means. Extract from c ISTAKHRNo. 17, dated 2otli July: 1922. ' E egaeding the P ost O ffice in B ahrein.' Demand of one of the inhabitants there. According to the conversation of a friend of our with the Director of the post office at Shiraz, it is understood that the question of the surrender of the post offices in the south has been settled, and the post offices at Bahrein are also to be surrendered to the representative of the Persian Government. We thank the Cabinet for this energetic step, and congratulate the sensible young men of Bahrein, particularly those speaking Persian on their Government from the depth of our hearts. We request the Director of the Post offices of the Ports to despatch a worthy official, who will be fully able to cope with the duties of the office, and attract the liking of the inhabitants to the Persian Government. If Mr. Pajuh would undertake this duty, he would have our gratitude. ABDUR BAHMAN, Faramarzi. Note by Editor, —Owing to shortness of space for the present we shall content ourselves with expressing our great joy at this event, and in our follow ing issues we shall write at length on the importance of this matter.

In continuation of correspondence ending with ray letter No. 613 -S.,* dated „ , ^ 0 , 1noo the 19th August 1922, I have the honour No. 71, dated 30th September 1922. , ji'-T l' to enclose, tor the miormation or the Government of Indi3, copy of the marginally cited despatch from His Majesty's *Seml No, 6,\ 4 Consul, Shiraz, to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, forwarding copy of two extracts from the Shiraz newspapers 4 Asr -i-Azadi' and 'Istakhr.* A certain Hirza Ahmed Khan, who is employed on the staff of the 4 Asr-i-Azadi', has lately been making a tour of the Gulf, in the course of which he paid a visit to Bahrein, so some such campaign as this in the press was to be expected. Doubtless by making wild and baseless accusations against the Political Agent at Bahrein, and representing him as an oppressor o? Persian subjects residing there, anti-British agitators hope to enlist the sympathy of the Persian Government and reopen the question of the latter's claim to Bahrein. The Mohammad Sharif referred to in the articles is one of the principal Persian merchants in Bahrein, and the recognized leader of by far the largo section of the Persian colony. There is however a loud voiced minority of Persians led by Eaji Abdul Nabi who are hostile to us and agitate to induce Persia to reassert her dubious claim to Bahrein. Haji Abdul Nabi is the man on whose behalf the British Government intervened in 1904 on account of the assault made on him by Sheikh Ali and his followers, and who subsequently became notorious about 10 years ago as the sell-styled Persian Consul and Passport Officer. The diatribes in the ' Asr-i-Azadi' are doubtless inspired by this gentleman. In respect of the allegation regarding Abdullah Bastaki I may remark that when this was first made in an Egyptian paper 1 made enquiries and found that the man died of pneumonia some days (during which he had plied his trade as a ' hamal') after his release from the Agency lo3k up. It may be within the memory of the Government of India that in July 1910 His Majesty's Government approved the expulsion of Eaji Abdul Nahi from Bahrein; I cannot trace in the Residency records why this was not carried out, but it is certainly to be regretted that he was allowed to remain in Bahrein and continue his anti-British intrigues. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. Enclosure to Ko. 71, dated 30th September 1922. Serial No, 8. From— H. G. Chick, Esq., To—Sir P. L. Loraine, Bart , C.M.G-., His Majesty^s Minister, etc., etc., etc , Tehran. For some time past the newspapers of Shiraz have been conducting an active campaign for direct Persian representation of Persian interests in the Bahrein Islands, and a week rarely passes without some allusion to Persian postal communications with the islands, the passport question, the teaching of Persian children, the disputed sovereignty, or alleged British oppression of Persian subjects. I now have the honour to forward for your perusal translations from last week's papers on the subject, as there appears to be an appeal to the Deputies in the Majlis or the Persian Government to take up the question. A copy cf this despatch and enclosures has been forwarded to the Political Bssident in the Persian Gulf. [Translation.] Newspaper ' Istakhr ' of Shiraz, No. 24 of 17(h September 1922. 'Where is Bahrain, and what is its condition'* (written to us bv a traveller). The Persian Government certainly has not desired to know what, where and in wimt condition is Bahrein. If it had wanted to know and understan d it would have undoubtedly be thought itself of giving some com fort to thUTifcrtunate inlialntants of this region, who consider themselves Persiau, and hope for the clemency of the Persian Government— 1. Bahrein is one of the ancient possessions of Persin, contains 363 con siderable villages and two large towns Muharraq and Manameh, and has 80,000 inhabitants. 2. Bahrein is altogether without any Persian Governor, Karguzar, Post (Office, Finance Agency and Military Force. 3. Any traveller wishing to go from Bashire to Bahrein is like travel ler from one place to another in the interior of Persia; hut any .traveller wanting to leave Bahrein for somewhere else must have a British passport, and thpy deal „with him as if in a British colony. .4. I^et it not he thought that the Resident or Brit'sh Agent interferes directly in affairs. No. They do not require to do so, as there is a Persian, Anglophile, worse than any foreigner in Bahrein, who works for the British better than thay do themselves. This is Muhammad Sharif 'Awazi, who on behalf of the Political Agent is in charge of the Police and Municipality, and who has tho title of Khan Bahadur Saidb. .•5. From fear of his intrigue and plots tlie inhabitants of Bahrein do not dare to breathe, or say they are alive. For they have seen how a certain Abdullah Bastaki by his intrigue died under the basti nado of the Political Agent and then how Muhammad Jawad and Abdun Nabi Bushiri and the rest of them made out an affidavit that Abdullah dit-d a natural death. They have Been how Asadullah Jami, for the criine of being a democrat, has been 3 months in prison and no one dares to go near him! 'They have seen how a certain Kacbalai Ghu'am Ali hai fled from the tyranny of these men, and orders were given to plunder his house and auction his effects, and how these men themselves ■ bought them up. They have seen how Tabarum, a Kazaruni merchant, for the crime of patriotism and writing a petition far a poor oppressed woman w^as put in jail, and with great difficulty was freed by Shaikh Khalaf the Qazi, who is anoiher of the friends of these men. Muhammad Sharif, without any apprehension is transporting to and from foreign ports all tho^e goods which legally are contrabaod. Bv these proceedings they want to say that Bahrein is not part of Persia, but foreign territory. Have the Persian Government never thought, or the Deputies in Parlia ment never asked why there is no Kargnzarate in Bahrein, and T\hy letters in Bahrein are stamped with foreign stamps, and what is the difference between Bahrein and Bunder Abbas or Lingeh ? Do they know that the Karguzar of Bushire has visited all places in the ports and coasts of Persia, but does not land at Bahrein, and considers it an impeitjaence to do so, as being outside his sphere of duties ? Shaikh Isa, the Governor of Bahrein who for long has been a rebel . against the Persian Government now regrets it, and understands tnat he has made a mistake. Why do not the Government win him over by a title, or robe of honour or an order, which in Persia are auctioned so freely ; and why do they not give him an official position so that gradually foreign influence may be under mined ? , Why is not a Persian flag hoisted here ? If it is hoisted, why does Sharif Awazi haul it down ? The rest of my evidence I will write at length bv the next post.— J traveller'6 Trcmtation.-Xew^per ' Mr-i-Mudi.', Ao. 1,933. ' News from the Proviuces. ( B ahrein).' In the internntional war the British chose Muhammad Sharif as a spy in TWhrein and h« willinglr made his position known, and tor thjs service was given the title of Khan Sahib. Afterwards he strove so hard tdiat as a result of the killing of Muhammad Abdullah Bastaki he obtained the title of Khan Bahadur. During the time of his spyins he has refrained from no sort of oppression and ill-treated the people of Bahrein as much as he could. If any one spoke ill of the Biitish he was immediately deported. For the past I years thev have been thinking of dividing Bahrein between the Arabs and h 8 British : ami if this is so, little by little Bahrein will fall into the hands of the British. 20 years a^o a conflict arosa he: ween the Arabs and Persians in Bahrein. The Arab Governor wanted to seize the Persivns ; but wlien the lattei realized tb.is thev took refuse with the British Consul. Afterwards agreements weie made between the Persians and the Consul and the Arabs, by which the Consul became the Protector and Governor of all foreign subjects Before this occur rence Persians and other nationals were under the orders of the Aiabs. Up till now the British Consul has been the Protector of the Persians, as Persia had always been a despotic government; bnt no.v why should the Biitish be the Protectors of Persians, seeing that they act as they please in Bahrein. Altogether British subjects in Bahrein number 300 to ^00. They have a pro tector so tl.al no one can molest them. But the unfortunate Persians resident Bahrein number about 12,000, and without any Consul or Protector are under the oppression of the British, and the Khan Bahadur. In truth, if Bahroin is part of Persia, why is not a Governor appointed for Bahrein ? If it is part of foreign territory, why is there no Persian Consul, to save the Persians from British oppression ? We beg the Ministry of the Interior to make some arrangement for Bahrein, and free these unfortunate subjects from oppression. No. 8]§-S, dated Busbire, the 3rd (received LUh) November 1922.

To—The Hoi^ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I enclose for your information two articles regarding Bahrein which have appeared in the'Asr-i-Azadi Yon will remember that the editor of this paper visited Bahrein to collect funds while I was on recess. He endeavoured to blackmail Muha-nnwl Sharif, but the latter appears to have had sufficient moral courage to decline to p -iy up, or assist him to »et money from the Persian community. He has therefore embarked on a scurrilous campaign. He made friends while here with Hay. Abd ul Nabi Kalawaz and one Abdul Talib an employe of the Mesopotamia Corporation. Both are notoriously anti-British and arc probably the source of the articles enclosed. Muhammad Sharif is rather annoyed, and has written off to some Minister whom he knows at Tehran com- plnining against the paper and pointing out that were it not for the protection afforded to Persians by the Agency in Bahrein they would have a very poor time. I would have preferred him not to have written without reference to mo, but it was done before I returned from recess. Haji Abdul Nabi is a bitter enemy of Abdul Nabi Bushiri who is head of the Pei^ian Shiahs and supports Muhammad Sharif. He has also, as you know, been warned by several P. A.s and is naturally not well disposed to the Agency. He was warned by me some time before I went on recess as reported to you at the time. He is I think, not really quite responsible for his actions and his personal enmities lead him on to anything which he thinks will damage their reputation.. He appears to be quite incorrigible.

He and sis other 'Persians residing in Bah ran came over to Bushire this week and presented a memorial to His Imperial Majesty the Shah setting forth their alleged grievances and praying His Majesty to appoint a Karg'uzir at Bahrein to look after their interests. As far as is known no action however has been taken on this memorrd. Serial No. 12 * Serial N (10).8 With regard to the actual cases mentioned in these articles, I would ohsem that three of^these are mentioned in nearly all the articles about Bahrein ami are three in which Haji Abdul Nabi has specially interested himself. The case of Mulla Bastaki referred to in the 6rst extract has already l?een reported ; it is true that the man di^d but of pneumonia some days after fce left the Agency lockup during which he had worked as usual as a coolie. Kerbalai Asad was accused of 'Dishonest mi^appropriat'on oE properly possessed by deceased person at the time &lt; f his death'. He pleaded not guilty butadmitted having disposed of the whole of the property of deceased, though he was unable to produce any will appointing him executor or an order from any Court; and nothing to show what he had don- with the property. He was found guilty by the Shara Court, and sentenced to 3 months imprisonment. Mulla Baranai Kazeruni was accused of ' forgery ' and pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to a fine of Bs. 30 and was released after having bedn detained in prison for 3^ days in all. His forgery was a very palpable and senseless one and he probably got off so lightly on this account. The case of Sheikh H-^fiz Misri* is well known to'the Government of India and has formed subiect of correspondence ; he is an Egyptian journalist of extreme views who was knocking about the Gu f and was not allowed to land a second time at Bahrein at the request of the Sheikh. Jasim Cherawi was one of the Secretaries of the Sheikh 'who was always interfering and on one occasion having gone too far h3 was made, with the approval of the Sheikh to give an undertaking to behave and jefrain from intrigue or be liable to deportation. Having broken this he was deported. x Tins ease was reported also reported to the Government of India. It is a curious thing that Haji Abdul Kabi continues to reside and carry on business in Bahrein, as he apparently finds the conditions of 1 fe so tryicg there. I beg tp suggest that he might be repatriated to his own country. In 1910 His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, informed this office (in his telegram No. 163t, dated 17th July 1910) that His Majesty's Government had agreed to the deportation of Haji Abdul Nabi for carrying on exactly ti e same intrigues as he is doing now. It is unfortunate that he was given time to wind up his affairs before being deported, and in the end was not sent away. During the war he lay very low, as he doubtless knew that, if he had given trouble then, he would have been deported or otherwise punished at once. Since the non- ratification of the Anglo-Persian Agreement and the subsequent wave of anti-British feeling in Persia, he has resumed his intrigues with renewed energy. Until recently he confined himself to calumniating the Agency, but recently he has started attacking the Sheikh and his family, who are much annoyed. If the Sheikh presses for the deportation of Haji Abdul Nabi, I beg to enquire whether I can authorize the Political Agent to carry it out 'at the request of the Ruler' or, as Haji Abdul Nabi is a foreigner under British protection, to inform the Sheikh that on account of his misbehaviour our protection is withdrawn from Haji Abdul Nabi and allow him to deport the man himself. Of the above two courses I should prefer the first, as the latter might be misinterpreted as a relaxation of our protection of foreigners. It is of course possible that Haji Abul Nabi would continue his agitation in Persia, but in this case he would not be in such a good position to carry it on as he is now.

Then, Karbalai Asad, by the Fatwa of Shaikh Khalaf and the plots o his Anglophile comrades, was condemned to 3 months imprisonment. Mulla Barani Kazaruni was threatened with fine and imprisonment because of his patriotism. Another, Shaikh Hafiz Wahaheh Misri was considered by them to be protecting the proletariate and they chased him away.

Por some time past ive have been al united in clamouring for this object, but we do not know what is the difficulty which prevents justice from reaching us. The Government does not think us. May God lift the curtain from this enigma.

What do you think about Bahrein and the Persians in Bahrein? We conside r you our representative. We are tired of the despotism of the British and the11 Anglophiles, who imitate the Czarlst regime; We have been insulted, and are left without self-respect. We haye lost, our status as Persians and human beings. Two of our kind, whose names we shall not forget, one of' them Muhamad Sharif who has been honoured w ith the title of Khan Bahadur, the other Abdun Nabi, son of Haji Ahmad Bushiri, have become Anglophiles. Appa rently they have derived beii( fit from it, and are now trained to it. Daily they are increasing their activities, and without taking note of the evil consequences of Anglophilism they ill-treat their own kind. Lastly, with that constant cry to the Government and Nation of Persia, and especially to Aghai Kazaruni, the representative of the Ports and Islands of the South, and to Shaikh Ahmad Paramarzi, in whom we particularly put our trust, we call their attention to this miserable region.

To-day the oppression of the Khan Bahadurs and British agents towards the Persians of Bahrein is degrees worse than formerly when published in the ' Asr-i-Azadi' and ' Istakhr.' The greater the number of patriots and those demanding freedom becomes, the more the tyranny and oppression of the British agents^ 2. Mulla Muhammad Abdul Wahab'Awazi, who is one of the patriotic persons and a friend of education, set out for Muhammareh and Ahwaz on behalf of bis maternal uncle, Haji Abdur Rahim 'Awazi. Last week, having obtained permission from the Consulate and taken a possport he left for the ship^ Muhammad Sharif officially sent police to the ship and brought Mm ashore, and detained him and his belongings A number of merchants enquired the cause of his detention from Agha Muhammad Sharif. He did not reply. But seeing that Haji Abdur Eahim is a person of character and a patriot, and that his views and policy are contrary to the views of Muhammad Sharif, the latter wants to annoy him. Eor this reason Mulla Abdul Muhammad Wahab, who is connected with him, was detained. 3. Agha Muhammad Sharif and his associates have caused such dissen sion among the Persians, particularly the Shiahs, that they are all deprived of mourning ceremonies. What a calamity is this into which the people of Bahrein have been plunged. In a town in a Muslim country the mourning for our Lord &lt;{ the Pifth ' becomes yearly a greater ceremony . Yet unfortunately persons like Muhammad Sharif do not allow people to perform pious cere monies and mourning rites, and the Muslims of Bahrein are all at loggerheads with each other. 4. On the 2nd Muharram, outside the town, they murdered a Persian, and nobody made any investigations about this matter because he was a Persian subject. Persians in Bahrein are masterless men. If he had been a British subject, the Khan Bahadurs and others would have spent their lives and for tunes in apprehending the murderer. 0 ! you deputies, who occupy seats in the Baharistan (Majlis at Tehran), take some thought for the condition of this unfortunate people of Bahrein. Do not allow Persian subjects to remain in difficulties under the subjection and oppression of foreigners. If Bahrein is not part of the Persian Empire, ought it not like a foreign country to have a Consul. It does not seem clear whether Bahrein is part of the Empire or a foreign country. But one man in Bahrein, Muhammad Sharif, rulesover the Persians, and it is not known by whose order he exercises this rule. Is he a Consul, or the protector of Per sians, or a representative of the Government •?12 Muhamtnad Sharif is that samd tiian who, after being expelled frorti Bandar Abbas and Lingeh, arrived in jBahrain, and, when during the Great War the British in Bahrain required a spy was appointed their spy. After he had arrested several innocent Arabs and Persians he was given the title of Khan Sahib. Last year, because a ring was lost from the Political Agency (which was subsequently found in an inkstand), IVIuhammad bin Abdullah Bastaki was put to death, and as a result the title of Khan Bahadur was given him : and the traces of his proceedings in Bandar Abbas and Lingeh are still to be seen. All the inhabitants confirm the illegality of his proceedings- We hope that the authorities, particularly the National Deputies, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of War will take up the condition of Persian subjects in Bahrain, and will give good news to the subjects in Bahrain through the newspaper Asr-i-Azadi.' 5. Some time ago the news of the irstallation of a Persian Government Post*office in Bahrain was read but no effect has been observed as yet. Per sians settled in Bahrain are hoping that, released from oppression, they may be able to send their petitions to the Government and free themselves. ■ III.-—Paper ' Azr-i-Azadi,' No. 124, dated 4tii Kevetiahe? 1922.

Orders were given to the Police and they went and brought the corpse, and took it to the doctor. The local doctor observed that one bullet had entered below the mouth, and that the head had been smashed w ith sticks from behind, and all the teeth pulled out and tied to the shirt. The municipality sent a public crier into the bazaar, and bade everyone come and identify the corpse. All the people came, but none claimed him for a relative. The doctor took a photograph of the man. He had only one eye. In the end, it appeared he was a Persian from one of the small ports, and a pearl-diver and the jolly-boat in which he had gone diving, had anchored near Bahrain. As he was a Persian nothing was done, but had he been a British subject you would have seen what would have happened. God is always the most merciful of the merciful. If Yamin-ul-Mamalik the Karguzar of the Ports also hears of this, he will not say anything, just as he did over the killing of Muhammad bin Abdullah Bastaki, who was killed for a wedding-ring. 3. As to Hassan Baluch, who had hoisted a flag on the right of his son's circumcision, and departed back to his country. Khan Bahadur Muhammad Sharif has sworn by the head of the Political Agent that if that dog Hassan returns he will not let him go, but will cast him into prison until he discloses who wrote to you. Wretched man, do you think that the pen of truthfulness will be broken, and the mouths of the defenders of the people will be dumb ?14 i iii ti &gt;-i xriinlAnr t p 'nfi^SGS from ono Persian port to anotliGr.

Arrivals in Bahrain could be stopped and sent back if they did not have a British pass and arrivals from Bahrain cannot have a Persian Pass if there is no one to give it. If Persian Government established Consular representative in Bahrain it means that they acquiesce in our contention as regards status of Island and apart from question as to whether it should be allowed or not mere lequest for exequatur would upset their claim to ownership.

I see little difficulty in giving effect to the proposals of His Majesty's Minister, Tehr tn if it were decided to act upon them. If we do so it will very definitely assert our position and might bring the matter to a head, the result of which would apparently be that His Majesty 's Government would repeat their former decision to the Persian Government to the effect that their contention cannot be considered. Passports for Bahrein would have to be vised by the British Council at Persian ports. The British Consul could decline to visa ilm-o-Khabar which are net passports and for use within Persia only. This would compel the issue of Foreign passports. We could arrange here to turn back arrivals whose passport is not endorsed and check departures from here for Persia without15 • much, difficulty. A very few might get through but- the penalty of being turned back and possibly having endorsement of his passport refused for breaking the regulations if caught would he so severe and inconvenient that few would be likely to try it on. Very few persons now leave Bahrein without identity certificates. I am of opinion that such action on our (L'art, though it would inevitably be attacked in the Persian Press, would a good deal restore prestige among the Persians here and might be not without effect in the ports of South Persia. The present attitude seems to be construed as inability on our part to affirm our position.# (Not printed.

I would send to Ibn Sand letter informing him that standing menace had been caused in Bahrein by his agent, and that as it is unthinkable that Persians are aggressors I hold that agent responsible for bloodshed which has been caused. With regard to return to Bahrein of any agent of Ibn Sand I would point out to him that he must consult us about new agent who must have definite instructions to hold strictly aloof from internal administration of Bahrein and from Consular functions and to confine himself to purely commercial ends, and also that, having warned off Germans,. French and others, we do not propose to allow him to upset status quo, This&gt; would be best done from Kuweit wdiere I propose to go as soon as I can safely leave Bahrein.

From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel S. Gr. Knox, C .S.I., C .I .E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to invite your attention to my telegram No. 421 of the 9th May in which I briefly put forward my reasons for doubting the expediency of carrying out the contemplated reforms in Bahrain in the present state of affairs in the Gulf. The object of this despatch is to amplify that telegram, ^ The Government of India will appreciate that when I sent you my telegram No. 417 of the 6th May I was unaware that the matter had been decided. Never theless I have such lively doubts as to the necessity for introducing reforms in the immediate present and such grave misgivings as to the outcome of such a policy, the results of which, may go far indeed beyond the mere local embarrassment of having to use forcible means of intervention, that I trust I may be pardoned if even at this late stage I beg that the whole question may be reconsidered. 2. I am quoting Colonel Trevor almost literally when I say that he quite candidly regarded the position in Bahrain as offering only a choice between two evils. He was of the opinion that the reforms would almost certainly not be introduced except under the strongest material compulsion by us, and he realized that our forcible intervention in Bahrain would attract much hostile criticism. On the other hand, he anticipated that the early introduction of reforms would secure some positive advantages which, in his view, on the whole outweighed the drawbacks. These advantages were firstly, that Persian attacks on our management of affairs in Bahrain might cease, and secondly, that some actual good would remain to our credit in the removal of flagrant abuses. I now beg leave to consider this portion of Colonel Trevor's argument some what more fully in the light of recent events and my own personal knowledge of Bahrain and its ruler. 3. The removal of a cause of anti-British agitation in Persia in regard to the grievances of Shiahs in the island was urged by the Foreign Office as a strong argument in favour of reform so long ago as July 1922 {vide your telegram 915-S. of 11th July 1922). But since then, even since Colonel Trevor wrote his despatch of the 27th January 1923, the Persian interest in Bahrain has gone far further than a campaign on behalLof .their co-religibnists there. It is not a question for them now of getting abuses removed but of claiming spvereignty over the island. At no time, 1 venture to think, was there a genuine desire in Persia for the removal ■ of the inequalities under which the Shiahs are supposed to suffer in Bahrain. The Persians in Bahrain are in reality for the most part smugglers driven there by the establishment of the Customs on the Persian side of the Gulf. They are in no way deserving of encouragement by Persia. The agitation on their behalf was ficti tious and it is highly doubtful if it would have been placated by reforms. On the other hand, the Persian claim to Bahrain, however unreasonable it may be, is a serious claim ; it is being advanced, as the Government of India are aware, from many sides simultaneously, and I have no doubt whatever that any pro-Shiah re forms we might succeed in forcing upon the Shaikh of Bahrain would not have the smallest effect towards reducing anti-British agitation and pressure in regard to that larger question. On the contrary, I am disposed to think that our active in troduction of reforms might have the very opposite effect by simply attracting more attention than ever to our own claims, and thus raise in an acute form the issue which I understand His Majesty's Minister is particularly anxious to avoid at present. If the placating of Persian hostility is a principal object of reform in Bahrain, then it would seem as if a large part of the foundation of that policy has already disappeared. 4. The other consideration which encouraged Colonel Trevor to propose the introduction of these reforms was the hope that at any rate some definite good would result, and a stain on our good name—inevitably associated with the state Subject.— Bahrain Reforms.of affairs in Bahrain—would be removed. With all defe ence I venture to express mv serious doubt whether the state of things has really reached such a pass tRat our credit is suffering, and whether the elaborate, far reaching, and costly scheme of reforms which is contemplated is so urgently called for. I have it from Colonel Trevor's own lips when he was discussing this case with me before he left, that whenever he visited Bahrain the number of persons who flocked to him to lay their complaints before him on all sorts of subjects was a serious nuisance. This very fact of itself seems to argue no small degree of liberty and ajdisregard of the Shaikh which I cannot help feeling would not be in evidence were he the tyrant he is often ^ pictured. Abuses there are n plenty; but on the whole si ace the establishment of' the British Political Agency in the island, the lot of foreigners has greatly improved, 1 now come to a more detailed comment on the proposed reforms. Firstly, as regards taxation. The apparent injustice need not, I think, seriously diturb us. Wh oever Shiahs are in power, Sunnis are correspondingly oppressed'; and provided the Sunnis in Bahrain do not altogether escape the incid ence of taxation, their privileged position does not appear open to grave objection: it certainly seems to me t6 be far from a scandal. But if the intention is to tax Sunnis and Shiahs equally, I very much doubt whether the influential^opi- nion of the island will support such a proposal. Unless the well understood privileges of the Sunnis on the Sunni side of the Gulf are to be preserved to a mate rial extent, the position of the Sunni ruler will be weakened while he will receive no credit from the Shiahs for benefits which will have been extorted from him. Secondly, the reform of the judicial system. I have no comment to make upon what is a comparatively simple matter, but not, I venture to suggest, of such urgency as to require a settlement under threat of compulsion. Thirdly, the Pearling Trade Abuses. As I suggested in my telegram of the 9th May, the reform of the Pearl Trade is a vquestion of the greatest complexity in which the A1 Khalifa family of Bahrain arc not alone concerned. Indeed I do not consider they can fairly be held responsible for the abuses which prevail, or could be expected to deal with such a delicate and difficult matter without the help of costly and elaborate British machinery. It is not in any sense a Bahrain question, but a Gulf one ; and the only reason why the same abuses in Kuwait and along the Trucial Coast are not so much in evi dence is that we are not in a position at these places to keep so close a watch on the trade. That there are cruelties and abuses in the Peafl Trade is painfully true. Per sonally I do not believe that the wretched business is one bit worse (or better) than it was ten years ago when I took an active interest in it. But if that fact does not absolve us from the duty of trying to remedy a bad condition of things, it does, T think, impose the necessity of caution in setting about a solution of so vast and ancient a problem. The truth of the matter is that the trade is a big gamble ; Capital has to run great risks ; it expects a correspondingly big reward during the few intervals of prosperity ; and its profits are at the expense of an ignorant, voiceless, and scattered population, collected from the dregs of the subjects of distant lands. The real road to reform lies, no doubt, through the delicate and hazardous machinery of trade unions, and co-operative societies, coupled with close maritime supervision ; and further, to be effective, the reform must cover the whole field of the' Persian Gulf and not Bahrain only. The task is stupendous, and should, I thmk, be taken up by itself as a separate problem, and not confused with the question of the misrule of the Shaikh of Bahrain. It must be plainly recognised that the only agency capable of carrying out such reform is the British .Govern ment, that it will be a difficult and costly business and that we should go slow and be reasonable in our demands, 5. I have attempted to throw a new light on the advantages which it is hoped to reap from the early introduction o| the above informs. It is now time to consider whether sufficient weight has been given to the very obvious dangers which attend this policy, These turn on the necessity, as to which I fear there is no question, of using force if they are to be introduced in Shaikh Isa's lifetime, and the consequences which the use of force may give rise to. That Shaikh Isa is a blind and wilfulV. ■ % J.te obstructionist, utterly opposed to all progress, is perhaps not so certain as some of his actions would lead one to suppose. I understand from Sir Arnold Wilson that the Shaikh has peronally expressed to him his eagerness to enter into an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for an Oil Concession and negotia tions to that end are now progressing satisfactorily. But this merely emphasizes his deep suspicion of any suggestion of change or reform which comes from, or which he imagines to be supported by the British Government. Force therefore will almost certainly have to be used to induce him to carry out such a very unDaiatable scheme of administrative reform. But the probable consequences go' further I thiuK, than Colonel Trevor could have foreseen, in the light of the^ fresh and intensive Persian agitation about the status of Bahrain which I have already refeired to. I regard it as more than likely that the Persian Government may force the issue or Bahrain before long, and challenge our claims in Bahrain before the League ff Nations. If that should happen, our case will be seriously ptej udiced by our having coerced and probably deposed the ruler, an old man with not many more years of life, and in addition— for we shall not be able to stop at his deposition — turned out his son Abdulla and his wife, Abdulla's mother. The sympathies of the whole of Sunni Islam will be aroused jnore especially as the reforms are par- ticularly aimed at Sunni privilege : and Bin Saud—who has alreadv given expression to his concern at the position of the Shaikh of Bahrain— will be antagonized ; and that at a time when, with the departure of Sir Percy Cox, the only man who has any influence over him, and the removal of his subsidy, lie will be particularly difficult to handle. It seems then that the forcible introduction of these reforms (and I do not See how they can be introduced otherwise than by force) will seriously compromise our claims to Bahrain by dragging in side issues, and by antagonizing Sunnis and Wahabis who are not really parties to the dispute. 6., The upshot of my argument is that the dangers far outweigh any advantages which the policy of reform may at one time have been supposed to possess : that regarded by themselves, and apart from any question of expediency at,the moment, the measures proposed either go further than seems really necessary—as in the case of taxation—or not far enough, as in the case of the large problem of Pearl Trade reform which, I venture to think, should be taken up at leisure and as a whole. I do not think there is any need for hurry : on the contrary, I beg to urge that there is every reason why we should go slowly. Our position in Bahrain is being seriously attacked at the present moment. 1 cannot think that it is expedient that we should select this particular time for drawing the attention of the whole Islamic world to our activities in Bahrain by embarking on this embarrassing business of compulsory reform. If and when the agitation in Persia has died down, or the question been definitely settled in our favour, the position will be unambiguous and our task comparatively simple. Another reason for delay is the age of Shiikh Isa himself. He was born in 1840, and is now therefore 75 years old. He cannot live much longer. For every reason, as Colonel Trevor himself pointed out, the easiest solution is the introduction of necessary reforms by his heir and successor Hamad, as the condition of his recognition by us. There would be an enormous advantage if these changes could be introduced by the ruler of his own accord—especially such as seem to attack Sunni interests. There will be an equal disadvantage if they are imposed on Shaikh Hamad after the forcible depo sition of his father. His position from the first will be almost impossible in such circumstances. I am sending copies of this despatch, and of the immediately preceding cor respondence to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, and the Colonial Secretary. P.S. —As the above letter is sent to the copyist, I have deceived telegram No. 60-C., dated 10th May 1923, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, which reports another serious fanatical outburst between '' Akhwan •' Nejdis and Persians. I do not consider it necessary to alter one word of the foregoing despatch as a consequence. The outburst merely emphasizes the acute and pressing danger of Wahibism, before which Persian claims and reforms recede into insignificance. / (Id.) S. G. K. G, M.

Priority. —Government's decision has been finally intimated to Shaikhs Hamad and Abdullah and they were urged to help in obtaining letter announcing abdication which would be brought by Sha kh to an interview with me this morning. Evident ly they have failed as Shaikh Isa has not come, and has sent letter asking me to send him letter announcing his deposition or to consult tribes. To delay longer would be fatal weakness, and I have replied telling him that as Government have decided, out of regard for public weal, that Shaikh Isa is too old to take active part in administration of public affairs which have been entrusted to Shaikh Hamad as Agent of his father, I see no necessity for consulting tribes. I added that steps to give effect to the decision of Government are being taken forthwith. This is being done.

From—The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. {Repeated Tehran, No. 112, Secretary of State for India, and Bahrein, No. 481). Medj lis was held by me on 26th May which was well attended by represent atives of all classes at Bahrein amongst whom Al-Khalifa family, Dowasir and other tribesmen were included. Bheihks Hamid and Abdullah urged these last to attend Medj lis, but before complying, they consulted Sheikh Isa who, however, sent them to attend, thereby acquiescing in proceedings to unexpected extent. Proceedings opened with speech by Hamad which was fluently and well delivered by Muhammad his brother, and in which fully empowered agent of Sheikh Isa stated that he relied confidently on help promised him by his brother Abdullah and by British Government to which family of Al-Khalifa were steadfastly loyal, and announced his intention of ruling and carrying on policy of his father of working for good of people under rule of Al-Khalifa. I followed dwelling on difficulties that surrounded Sheikh Isa especially at outset, speaking in praise of his rule of 56 years and stating that at age of 75 there was nothing to wonder at that he had found himself unwilling to enter upon stoney path of reforms which would involve incessant struggle with independent communities and petty tyrannies that had grown up during later years of what I preferred to describe as his lack of rule, and that therefore it had been found necessary by Government to introduce new blood and forbid interference of Sheikh Isa with reforms which in order to bring Bahrein up to level of modern civilisation it had been found necessary to intro duce. I said that debt of gratitude was owed to old ruler by everybody present, including myself as representative of His Majesty's (government, for long and on the whole prosperous rule of many years, in spite of covetous eyes on both sides of Gulf and many difficulties, and that no dQubt, his disappearance would naturally be viewed with regret by many Sunnis there. I indulged however in the hope that Sunni community would ultimately benefit from reforms. I contrasted Sheikh's rule over Sunnis with Political Agent's rule over foreigners. The one had been behind purdah and marked by aloofness of Sunnis'to-day from foreign progress while the other was open and above board. Foreigners had multiplied, progressed and prospered while Sunni community was not pulling its weight in boat or enjoy ing that preponderance in Bahrein affairs which was its birth right, and had lagged behind in race, and I hoped that Sunnis would be led to their right place by Sheikh Hamad's rule assisted by Abdullah his brother, and supported against internal sedition and external aggression by His Majesty's Government. I then in turn lectured each community and laid stress o i absolute necessity for stronger rule of one Sheikh of family of Al-Khalifa and not irresponsible rule of 30 or more self- appointed persons responsible to themselves only. Thus far my speech was in English read out later in Arabic. I then turned to Hamad, and, explaining that for one word to Hamad I spoke six to my other hearers, gave him publicly in Arabic some useful advise for his future governance. Representative audience received^ both speeches well and both Hamad and Abdullah are enthusiastic. Flattering reference to Sheikh Isa especially pleased them. Sheikh Isa seems already acquiescent, and Bahrein reforms seem to have started well and in right atmosphere so far as can be judged. It will probably particularly interest Tehran that I received from Bahrein Persians (not the Baharinah) an entirely unsolicited testimonial that their spokes man disclaimed all connection with newspapers and Tehran agitation, and said that Persian rule or severance of British connection with Bahrein was desired, with few animportancnt exceptions, by no Persian in Bahrein, Local Persians imagined steps taken by us were purely on their account and were generally delighted at Qassibi's discomfiture. In view of anti-British agitation in Persian press they seemed surprised that we should take so much trouble. I have now returned to Bushire and at end of month leave for Koweit.

But it is regarded by me as of first importance that Assistant selected should have very much better knowledge especially on administrative side. I am led to suppose, by my experience in Basra, that with utmost care in selection Bahrein court under Behrein Order in Council* might be self-supporting entirely or so nearly so that Bahrein itself would be enabled to meet charges with modest contribution from Baherin customs. Consequently for this particular reform no extra expense to Government would be entailed. Daly must have his hands free a»d time to think. Knowledge of Arabic is not es eitial though desirable, for nowhere will it be more quickly learnt than in miscellaneous legal work. As regards accommodation no difficulty is anticipated by Daly at present. Man of Gidney's stamp would be invaluable. Post of Judical Adviser might be reduced, and Political Agent again take over work when Arab side of Bahrein Government is running smoothly, say in five years' time. I trust urgent steps may be taken to give effect to this proposal which Secretary cf State for India has already sanctioned in principle in his telegram dated 18th May, No. 1844t subject to India's remarks.

F I have the honour to forward herewith a report in narrative form of my recent proceedings at Bahrain with a view to the initiation of the reforms prescribed in telegraphic correspondence ending with telegram No. 1629 from the Secretary of State for India contained in your telegram No. 584-S., dated 5th May 1923. REPORT ON BAHRAIN REFORMS. A perusal of Confidential Report No. -C., dated 13th May 1923, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Political Resident, Bushire, which forms Appendix I to this Report, will probably be the best introduction to this narrative. I would take the opportunity of inviting the attention of Government to the valuable assistance rendered to the Political Agent, Bahrain, by Mr. J. B. Mackie of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company whose statement forms the first enclosure to the Political Agent's Report. I have already expressed to him personally my warm appreciation of the services rendered but I should be happy if I might be privileged to be the channel of communication of an appreciation by the Government of India of Mr. Mackie's assistance. Although these disturbances between Nejdis and Persians broke out fresh on the morning of the 10th May, there was unfortunately some unavoidable delay in getting warships to the scene of action where H. M's. Ships ' Triad ' and ' Crocus ' did not arrive before the afternoon of the 13th May. The telegrams from Bahrain had been alarming and there was no knowing how far the disturbance might spread, especially when in his telegram No. 62-C., dated 12th May, repeated in due course to the Foreign Department, the Political Agent, Bahrain, reported that distur bances had broken out beyond the limits of the Manameh Municipality and that the Bahrain Sunnis were attacking the Baharinah. It seemed quite likely that there would be Sunni-Shiah fighting all over the Islands. As a matter of fact, how ever, this particular incident resolved itself into a rather mild affair of Sunni land lords chastising their Baharinah tenants and on the whole those Sunnis no doubt thought that they behaved with studied moderation. I do not seek to palliate their conduct but merely to reflect the Sunni point of view. It must be remembered that when the Political Agent talks of houses burnt he really means rough huts of date matting that can be constructed in one day. The casualties in all amounted to five deaths, probably the result of the indiscriminate Arab firing into a crowded locality. 3. I was anxious if possible to get H. M. S. ' Triad ' to Bahrain as soon as possible and so took the responsibility of diverting the mail steamer though at one time, it looked as if rough weather would prevent me and my party from embark ing on her. Fortunately, the weather abated and I was able to get myself, one British Officer and one extra platoon* from the 15th Punjabi Regiment stationed at Bushire on board B. I. S. S. ' Varela ' in the early morning of the 14th May. Again unfortunately an accident to the Varela's engines made progress slow and we had to tranship, still in fairly rough weather, to H.M.S, ' Triad ' at Bahrain, not far short of midnight. My best thanks are due to the B. I. Company for this timely assistance and to the Senior Naval officer for the excellent arrangements made for transhipping me and my men from the ' Varela ' to H.M.S. ' Triad ', thereby releasing the mail steamer with the least possible delay. 4. On the morning of the 15th, Major Daly, accompanied by Shaikh Hamad came off to see me and we discussed the situation. Both were able to assure me that the disturbances had ceased with the arrival of the men-of-war, if not indeed before, and that the situation was well ip hand. It seemed to me inadvisable with only two days left to the termination of the long Ramazan fast and with the two days of Id festivities immediately following, to attempt to commence rather difficult and delicate negotiations. My immediate presence for the quelling of disturbances was evidently not required and any drastic steps on the part of H. M.'s ships would * The presence of the§e troops at Bahraii} is no longer required and they returnorf to Bushire in the course cf this week, MC194FD V2 have been entirely snperfluous. From every point of view it seemed desirable to allow passions to cool down and minds to settle. I remained therefore on board H.M.S ' Triad ' in close and immediate touch with the Political Agent on shore and with frequent visits from him, until the evening of the 18th. This inactivity and departure from precedent—for precedent insists that the bhaikh of Bahrain should within the first 24 hours of the Political Resident's arrival, proceed and pay his respects to him—had the unexpected effect of causing something like a panic among the Al-Khalifa family and the inhabitants of Bahrain. I was doing nothing and they could not imagine what I was doing. Shaikh 'Isa frequently attempted to get off to see me, going so far as to assure me that the fast made no difference, but I put him off with polite messages, saying that although I was as anxious to see him as he was to see me, I was the bearer of important communications from my Government to himself and preferred to wait until his mind should be completely free from the privations of the sacred month and the ensuing festivities. This leisure also enabled me to prepare and have ready against my landing, my com munication to the Sultan of Nejd regarding the conduct of his agent, Abdulla Al- Qasaibi. Abdulla was sent for that same evening. I took a very curt and haughty tone with him, refusing his proferred (hand?) and merely passing the letter to him with the remark ' This is for your master : read it.' When he had finished its perusal, I asked him if he had fully mastered its contents and he replied in the affirmative. I then said that I wished him out of the Island by noon the following day at the latest and accepted his promise that he would go. As a matter of fact, he left the same night giving out that Bin Saud required his presence on urgent and pressing business. I understand that this misrepresentation failed to convince anybody in Bahrain. A copy of my letter to the Sultan of Nejd, both in English and in Arabic, forms Appendix II to this report. I trust that.it will be found to meet the condi tions laid down by the Secretary of State for the Colonies repeated to me for my guidance by the Secretary of State for India in his telegram No. 1844, dated 18th May- ' 5. The morning of the 19th passed in purely official visits at which no business was discussed. Shaikh 'Isa called on me at the Agency at about 9 a.m . and his call was returned by me at the Customs Buildings as soon as ever the Arabs had had time to' prepare it for my reception. At the latter interview it was, however, arranged that in the afternoon Shaikhs Hamad and Abdullah should return to discuss with me and the Political Agent the communications of which I was the bearer from His Majesty's Government so that Shaikh 'Isa might be well informed of what it was proposed to discuss, before the really important interview, which was fixed for 9 a.m. on the 19th May, took place. 6. I consider that it is hardly necessary for me to trouble Government with details of the interminable .conversations that ensued. I had prepared as a preli minary and test case, a letter from Shaikh 'Isa addressed to myself which purported to describe what both he and I knew well to be the impression, both of the Shaikh and of the Bahrain public in general, as to the powers of the Political Agent to deport foreigners. In the letter Shaikh 'Isa went on to say that he understood from me that legal doubts had arisen in the mind of His Majesty's Government as to whether Shaikh 'Isa really desired that such powers should be possessed by the Political Agent and the letter from himself was necessary to remove this doubt, he was therefore writing to me to say that he not only wished the Political Agent to have such powers but to use them with special reference to seditious persons ^ (foreigners) plotting against his rule or endeavouring to sow dissensions between himself and the British G-overnment or between the various classes of the com munity or exciting hatred against himself or the British Government among such classes. I placed this letter before Shaikh 'Isa at my interview on the morning of the 20th, told him that both he and I knew that this represented the opinion of both himself and the Bahrain public, and asked him to sign it. He asked for time to consider. I laughed and said we all knew what this meant and then proceeded to comment on the little effect that Colonel Trevor's warnings of one year ago appeared to have had on Shaikh 'Isa's mind. I then went on to explain that the orders relat ing to Bahrain reforms had really emanated, on this occasion, from the Department oi the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in London and were perhaps something in the nature of a ' bolt from the blue ' so far as the Political Agent, Bahrain, myself and my immediate predecessor, Colonel Trevor, were concerned ; in fact, I had it3 in writing from my predecessor that lie did not suppose that anything in the nature of Bahrain reforms could be seriously attempted bsfore the close of the pearlino season and that it would probably devolve on him to take such steps as might be necessary, I even ventured to hint that possibly even the Government of India had hardly been prepared for the drastic orders that had come from the very highest quarters and that Shaikh Isa must endeavour to realize that lie was really commit ted to a serious course of reform. I told him that the jurisdiction letter was a matter of no importance, that the powers would probably be granted whether he wished it or no, and that I had been instructed by the Government of India to apply officially for the grant of such powers—a measure in which I should have their full support with the Home Government—and that I had not been instructed to consult Shaikh 'Isa on the subject. I read over to him suitable extracts from Viceroy's telegram 475-S., dated 1/th April 1923, especially the passage ' We shall back him up in carrying out reforms ' concluding with ' We must be prepared to enforce reforms ourselves.' I warned Shaikh 'Isa that this meant a perpetual struggle with the tribes, with the members of his own family, notably his own wife, and unceasing vigilance to prevent relapse. I told him frankly that his conduct with regard to the Deportation Jetter, his treatment of the Manameh Electric Scheme, his silly mistrust of the employment of old iron rails by the Political Agent to strengthen local bridges, his allowing his wife to bank or bury a sum of Us. 500 daily from the Bahrain Customs revenue, indicated to me clearly that he was not the man, at seventy five years of age—if indeed he ever was—to enter upon the arduous task of reform and urged him to stand aside and give his heir-apparent an entirely free hand- I drew a parallel between such a state of affairs and the enviable position of Abdur Rahman bin Faisui of Riyadh, who occupied himself with his agricultural properties and preparing for his latter end, while his son, Abdul Aziz, bore all the heat and burden of the day. I said that I had never heard that Abdul Rahman had ever suffered in reputation or dignity. Shaikh 'Isa here interposed with the remark that Abdul Aziz had won his empire with his own right hand and that the circumstances were not parallel. I was quick to retort 'And who, pray, conquered Bahrain for you and called you, an orphan and a fugitive, to take your seat as Shaikh of Bahrain ? And who, all these fifty-five years, has kept and maintained you here against Turkish force and Persian fraud, internal and external enemies ? Was it your greedy, disloyal tribesmen or the British Government ? And if now looking to the good of all, in its wisdom the British Government asks you to make way for a younger and stronger man a year or two before God calls you to himself, is there any gross oppression or cruelty in such conduct ? Does it not rather show a kindly solicitude for your welfare as well as that of your subjects in setting you free from the anxietias of this difficult and thankless task ? There is no reason why you should not continue to enjoy the name and dignity of Shaikh of Bahrain— indeed it is not our intention that Shaikh Hamad should be other than your fully empowered vakil who is under no necessity of consulting his principal any more than he consults any otherwise old greybeard in Bahrain.' Shaikh 'Isa however replied in his customary style that though he was absolutely at the orders of Government, that though they might cut his throat or throw him into the sea, he would not willingly abdicate. I said that in that case nothing remained for me to do except to consult my Government, report the facts and ask them whether they empowered me to set Shaikh 'Isa aside forcibly, that from the tenoilr of the telegrams in my hands, I had little doubt that they would instruct me to do so, but that, ex abun- dante cautela, I would consult ihem once again which would probably give him three days in which to reflect on the situation and decide whether it was wiser to go out of his own free will or be removed, in which latter case it would unfortunately be necessary for me to justify my conduct by some reflections on Shaikh 'Isa's obstructive methods which could hardly be palatable to him, however I might endeavour, as I certainly should, to soften them down. It was as he was taking leave that the Shaikh begged me to keep the matter secret and gave the assurance I have already cited in one of telegrams, that, for him personally, the Shaikdom of Bahrain was not worth the smoke of a cigarette, 7. During the three days that followed, the Political Agent and I-had frequent interviews with Shaikhs Hamad and Abdullah. I affected to concern myself little with what might be the outcome of my reference to Government and to be more • occupied with the proceedings at the Majlis which I announced my intention of call ing at a decent interval after the orders of Government reached me, whether Shaikh1K i Hamad should make a speech, whether I should make a speech, what we should sar, etc etc Isave the sons a draft letter for Shaikh Isa to think over and, if eventully he felt so disposed, to sign. There was some talk about this letter and it was pro posed that two letters should be prepared, one for the public information announc- fng his retirement and his handing over affairs to Shaikh Hamad and the other secret containing Shaikh 'Isa's assurance that he would in no way interfere, intrigue Linst or counteract Shaikh Hamad's measures of reform It was also proposed that this secret letter should contain some assurances as to Shaikh Isa s personal allowances after retirement, and that he acquiesced in aU Government revenues passing to Shaikh Hamad and to Shaikh Hamad alone. 8 On the afternoon of the 23rd of May, telegram No. 674-S., dated 23rd May, from VOU to myself at Bahrain, gave me the full assurances I sought and I com- muificated its contents to Shaikhs Hamad and Abdullah and urged them to make one last effort to induce Shaikh 'Isa to bring me the desired letters, secret and open if they so preferred, at my interview with him next morning The next morning (the 24th), however, nothing canie but a letter from Shaikh Isa informing me that Shaikhs Hamad and Abdullah had communicated my message to him and that he urged that I would either consult the tribes as to whether they still wished him as a ruler, or failing that, would acquaint him by letter with the decision of Government. It is as well to state here that at the interview of the 20tli May, Shaikh 'Isa had already urged me to consult the tribes, i asked who the tribes might be, knowing well that beyond the Al-Khalifa and the Dowasir Head men of Budaiyah, who have ever one eye turned in the direction ot Bm baud, there are no tribes in Bahrain worthy the name. - I told him that it is quite superfluous for me to consult the tribes knowing perfectly well that their answer would be that they preferred Shaikh 'Isa, who allowed them to do anything they liked, rather than a Shaikh who would rule them, bring them to subjection and exact the Shaikh- ly dues from them. It was no such consent I was out to seek when the British Government had already firmly decided that anarchy must cease. 9. I must also remark here that Shaikh 'Isa himself broke our pact of secrecy ordering a Mazbata (circular petition) to be prepared by his own special proteges, among the Baharinah which all Baharinah were to be ordered to sign. The attempt was hopeless ; Isa's myrmidons were informed that they might sign the Mazbata if they pleased but that nobody else was going to, and Baharinah quickly countered with two powerful Mazbatas addressed to myself, telling me of the oppression they had lain under for the past twenty years owing to Shaikh Isa's tolerating every petty Shaikhling oppressing them at his option. 10. To Shaikh Isa's letter of the 24th morning I replied briefly stating that I saw no necessity to consult the tribes and that Government's orders were that he should make way for his son and no longer take an active part in the administration and that the necessary steps were being taken to give effect to these orders. I had arranged to have the Director of Customs in attendance. I summoned him and gave him a personal warning to the effect that the Customs revenues were to be paid to Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Hamad alone and that no drafts except those under Shaikh Hamad's signature were to be honoured : in case of failure by him to comply with these orders, he would be held personally responsible. I learnt subse quently from Major Daly- that the Customs Director immediately took ship for Muharraq to consult Shaikh 'Isa on the subject of the order that he had received and was met there by the local Muharraq Director .who asked on what errand he was bound. When he told the Muharraq Director what his errand was, the local Director informed him that his errand was utterly futile, his news was stale and everybody knew all about it. The Customs Director thereupon returned and I had a little word with him subsequently on the folly of his conduct in that he, a British subject, attempted to intrigue with Shaikh 'Isa against the orders of the British Government: he would probably find himself sufficiently occupied in. endeavouring to set his own house in order against an enquiry into the administra tion of the Customs which must inevitably follow in the course of two or three- months. 11. We then set in earnest about the preparations for the Majlis at which the public announcement of Shaikh Isa's retirement would be made. It was fixed for and held on the morning of Saturday, the 26tli of May. There was much talk in5 ttae meantime of solemn pacts between Shaikh 'Isa and tlie tribes, that they would never desert each other, that they would emigrate in a body and leave the Island, that they had no use for a Majlis at which they would sit in com pany with that objectionable person, the foreigner and their own ryots, the Baharinah. I took occasion to warn Shaiks Hamad and Abdullah that Shaikh 'Isa was in no sense a free agent, that I saw no necessity for him to leave Bahrain at all, and in any case, if he found the new regime so distasteful, 1 expected him to consult the British Government as to his future place of residence when no doubt, Bombay or Ceylon could be arranged for him and asked ' if the tribes proposed to follow him there V It all petered out in talk and when even tually the evening before the Majlis, Shaikhs Hamad and Abdullah ordered the Sunni representatives to attend fie Majlis which wasjicld in the Agency, the Sunnis d 4 d, so I understand, go to Shaikh 'Isa to take h : s orders on tin subject. It is reported that Shaikh 'Isa replied to them that Shaikh Hamad was his son, that ho had brought h'm up, that he was his heir-apparent and that the tribes had better obey bis orders, thus showing an unexpected degree of acquiescence in the pro ceedings. I have already in my telegram No. 481, dated 29th May, given a brief epitome of what took place at the Majlis and Appendix III to this Report gives, to the best of my recollection, the speech I delivered thereat in English and in Arabic. Shaikh Hamad sat on my right and Captain Coleridge of H. M. S. ' Cyclamen '' on Shaikh Hamad's right. On my left was the Political Agent and on his left Shaikh Abdullah. Members of Al-Khalifa family seated on chairs formed the horns of the Assembly, A sprinkling of English residents or visitors to Bahrain were seated behind me on chairs and representatives of the communities in Ipa)rain seated on carpets formed the main body of the Majlis between the two horns. I judged the number of persons to have been between 200 and 300 persons. Shaikh Hamad's address was first made. It had been prepared by the Political Agent in close consultation with Shaikhs Hamad and Abdullah, 'It was read with remark able facility and eloquence by Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Isa, the second brother and poet of the family, and was so remarkably well read that even I, a foreigner, did not fail to appreciate and catch every word. Shaikh Muhammad, as was his due, received many compliments after the Majlis closed, on the clearness and emphasis with which it was read. Shaikh Hamad's speech with translation forms Appendix IV to this 'Report. My own speech I delivered from scanty notes which were hardly looked at and I have not thought it advisable to delay this Report so as to include the Arabic version which was read by the clerk of the Municipality at Manameh and has been retained for the present by the Political Agent, Bahrain, in order that copies may be made and distributed. It shall be forwarded as soon as practicable for the information of Government with other documents referred to here and there, not Appendices, in this report. 12. Throughout the proceedings I was careful not to fetter myself and warned Shaikh Hamacf not' to fetter himself by specifying detailed measures of reform. I have alreadv telegraphed (Despatch No. 482, 'dated 29th May, to your address) the one measure of reform that presses most urgently, setting the Political Agent- free to devote himself entirely to the guidance and strengthening of Shaikh Hamad. • I formed a very favourable opinion of Major Daly whom I met for the first time at Bahrain. He appears to me capable, zealous and energetic, with a good practical experience and a' good understanding of Arabs and their ways. Above all, he seems to have established a most complete and desirable ascendency over Shaikh Hamad and a firm hold—though not of course the close friendship he has formed with Hamad—over the gther brother, Abdullah, a very important peonage. If we can secure this freedom for the Political Agent, of which I have endeavoured with all the force at mv command, to show the desirability, I think that the rest % will in (Treat measure follow. We may hope to retain Major Daly for another two vears without special leave anrl I will only remark in passing that it is by no means unlikelv that circumstances may involve occasional deputation of him to the Sultan of Nejd on the business 'of His Majesty's Government and during such absences which may perhaps be prolonged I regard it as of the highest importance that BfWain should not be left without a good Englishman in charge. No Indian, Arab or Persian Assistants will suffice. The man selected should be prepared to stav learn Bahrain thoroughly and take Daly's place when required either when he is absent on deputation or when he eventually leaves Bahrain on leave, as for the oood of the service he eventually must, probably about two years from now. It all depends on the selection made now whether the man can ear n his own salary MG194FD ' ,6 from fee. tWh of course it would have to be paid in the first instance from the Indian Goven'ment who must be recouped from fees and if necessary, from the Bahrain Customs. . . , , i ^ ^ ^ i • ^ 13 The word wdl ^ in goJd eTrnS ^legards th^methods of collection I am credibly informed that for good reasons from the point of view of the Director of Custom^ the accounts are kept m Smdi so anticipated the proceedings of German Industrial magnates m the payment of revenue to their own Government. Such merchants pay when and how they please to then- great advantage whereas smaller men and petty shopkeepers are forced to pay on the nail. On the outgoing side there is the same confusion and want of method Shaikh 'Isa draws Rs. 1,000 a day of which his wife imme diately banks or buries half, while Shaikh 'Isa though s P en ^nothmg on h .mse f, squanders the remainder in various unproductive ways ihat door has 1 fancy, been finally closed, but the Director of Muharraq, the father of the noted Jasim AbGhirawi, is a kind of general agent for all the members of the Al-lvhahfa, who not only draw handsome allowances, but at the same time have all their household expenses paid through the Muharraq Agent who supplies them with whatever they require, from a box of matches, firewood and forage forcamels tomo„or ca,a and motor boats for these sky -children of the AkKhahfa. No doubt, the agent feathers his own nest well in the process. In spite of the members of the Al- Khalifa enjoying wealth such as they have never enjoyed betore, they are a I extravagant and in debt. It can be imagined what a heroic task is in front of Shaikh Hamad and the Political Agent m the reform of the Customs alone, both ingoings and outgoings, and in regard to the former, it will probably be necessaiy for them to ask for the assistance of an expert to enable them to set their house in order, and the Customs revenue forms the main source of income, It can probably be made to yield double, and the outgoings of the AI-Khahfa might well be reduced to a fifth of the present expenditure. 14. Another urgent reform is Tapu, a regular revenue settlement, and this should probably follow Customs reform which one might hope will set free the funds available'for this expenditure and provide yet another full source of income, I trust I have said enough to show how busy the Political Agent will be betore ne ever gets to the pearling reforms, and the absolute necessity and urgency ot taking the immediate steps indicated by me. Bushire ; ' S. G. KNOX, Lieut.-Cdonel, The 31st May 1923. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,APPENDIX I TO REPORT ON BAHRAIN REFORMS. Memorandum No. -C., doted 13th May 1923, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Hon hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my No. 55-C., although the Najdis had ostensibly made peace with the Persians, fresh disturbances on a larger scale broke out on the morning of the 10th. Abdulla Qosaibi and Mohamed Sherif arrived in the Agency with the following story, over which they both agreed : A boy in the service of Qdsaibi was said to have stolen a broken watch from his house ; another servant reported to Qosaibi that he had seen it exposed for sale in the shop of a Persian, and had demanded that it should be handed back. The Persian replied that he had bought it from the boy for Re. 1, having no reason to suspect that it had been stolen, and had paid Rs. 2 for its repair. He would return it if he were paid his out-of-pocket expenses. Abdulla Qosaibi then went himself with two Najdis to the shop, and demanded the return of the watch without payment. A contro versy ensued, and Qosaibi compelled the shopkeeper to go with him to Mohamed Sherif. It is said that he was roughly handled by Qosaibi's men. Mohamed Sherif endeavoured to placate the Persian and himself paid the Rs. 3 demanded. Qosaibi left, the matter being apparently settled. Very shortly after, the two Persians arrived at Mohamed Sherif's office bleeding profusely from dagger wounds, which, they said, had been inflicted by two Najdis. Mahomed Sherif, fearing to send them through the bazaar in their wounded state, sent word to Qosaibi asking him to come and see them. On Qosaibi's arrival he pointed out that the matter was likely to be a more serious one than they could themselves settle and requested Qosaibi to send the Najdis to the Agency, while he would order the Persians to do likewise, and get the matter settled by the Political Agent. Qosaibi suggested that they should first make their own enquiries and during the delay the whole bazaar flared up, and a general fight ensued bet ween Najdis and Persians. Qosaibi and Mahomed Sherif came to the Agency by a round about way to avoid the fight. Mahomed Sherif asked for the assistance of the Agency Guard to quell the dis- ' turbance. ^his request I felt unable to comply with, as I thought the use of the Agency detachment at a moment when the fight was actually in progress, might well force a situation, the result of which could not be foreseen. I endeavoured to persuade Mahomed Sherif and Qosaibi to come with me to the bazaar to use their influence with their respective parties. Qosaibi however was uncontrollably excited, and bitter against the Persians whom he accused of having collected heavily armed. He admitted that the first signs of the actual disturbance he had seen were the two wounded Persians, Meanwhile Yusuf Kanoo arrived by Mr. Meikle of ' Mespers '. He stated that the affray had grown serious and suggest ed the use of the Agency troops in the bazaar. I declined on the grounds above stated. Having however ascertained that there was no crowd between the Agency and Messrs. ' Mespers ' office, which is well away from the bazaar, and therefore no likelihood of a collision, I left orders for the Guard to march there but to take no action of any sort. I caused Yusuf Kanoo to despatch several people to the bazaar to spread the news that the troops were coming. I then proceeded to the bazaar myself, by car. Qosaibi declined to accompany me, and fearing that it would give a false impression if I took with me only the leader of the Persians, I went accompanied by Yusuf Kanoo and a Qatar merchant. On arrival I found the actual fighting had ceased, doubtless as a result of the news that troops had left the Agency. The bazaar was full cf excited Najdis, armed with lathis and some with swords, daggers and firearms. At first no Persians were to be seen, but later a few who lived on the spot came out of their buildings. I proceeded to collect sticks, etc., from the crowd and to disperse them as far as possible. When it was clear that the situation was in hand and a collision was very improbable, I sent word to the Guard who were at Messrs. Mespers, to march with me through the bazaar, and then sent them back to the Agency. Shortly after, Qosaibi arrived with a crowd of Najdis. Meanwhile Mr. Mackie had appeared from Yusuf Kanoo's house. He assisted me to cause the dead and wounded to be removed, which I ^vas anxious to do early, lest their presence should cause a further outbreak. W e caused to be removed iwo dead Persians and one Najdi, and two Persians and one Najdi who were still just breathing. A number of wounded who could walk were sent to hospital. During these proceedings Qosaibi was beside himself with rage against the Persians, making a fresh scene as each injured Najdi was discovered. His behavioui undulyexcited the Naidis and I Lad to order him to go into his office and remain tiere, arorder Which he resented, but for the moment obeyed. He reappeared later m the° ame state of excitement and I again had to severely warn him. ■ A ,V tW bazaar until all was quiet, and several shops had re-opened. I remained '' the bazaar un^ ^ gha . k binEagawho had come On my return to tl 8 e ^ gureB to be adopted. It was agreed to have a meeting to consult me a. t leaders were to be asked, with a view to easing the that ®.v enin £^ b jj^ concerMd were waiting for Shaik Hamad in the evening Situation, v.

Had they done so it might perhaps not have occurred on so large a scale. The following morning (11th) I passed through the bazaars and all was quiet, T ater events occurred which are described by Mr. Macfee in his statement. I should here like to mention that his prompt handling of the situation which arose ™doubtedlv prevented a further outbreak. On receiving news of these occurrences I again went to the bazaar and found Mr. Macfcie had controlled the situ dion. t {oull d Shaik Sclman at the Customs surrounded by fidawis who had done nothing. He asked me for advice and I accompanied him through the bazaar to instruct r i • j ass ist to disperse the crowd. I enquired of Qosaibi the cause of disturbances before my arrival. He declared that the Persians had been and still were coUected In certain Khans, heavily armed. Shaik Selman and I, taking Oo'aibi with us, visited these Khans. We found no gatherings and no arms. I then visited Qosaibi's premises where there were a number of iSajdis armed with lathis I had them sent away. His private house contained about 15 Najdis armed with rifles and swords. These, he explained, were messengers etc. from Bin Saud who were guests in his house and had not quitted it. On my return ^ 0 ^ Agency I learned that a disturbance was m progress at Muharraq, and that ISa^dis were Hawasing ' in front of the houses of Shaikhs Easa and Hamad ihe Shaik had ordered that no boats be allowed to leave Muharraq for Manameh, but could not control the Najdis who seized boats. At about noon five large boats crowded with Naidis, all armed and many with magazine rifles, were observect coming from Muharraq. 1 sent to Shaik Selman to take steps to stop them landing. Meanwhile instead of proceeding to the Customs pier the boats drew m at the Agency. The occupants carried flags and were Hawasmg and hrmg rifles. As their intentions were not clear, I fell in the detachment, out of their sight. They were disembarking, when Qosaibi, who had been sent by Snaik Selman to. dissuade them, arrived. He argued for some time but appeared uname to control them and they were pressing past him to the shore. ^ Realizing that tne result of their landing in the Persian residential quarter and the fact that there were Persians in the Agency, might be serious, I ordered the detachment to take up a position conspicuously along the sea wall of the Agency and sent a m ess ageto Qosaibi, drawing his attention to the fact that the soldiers were prepared and thai; I would take action if they landed within Agency limjts. As was anticipated this brought them to their senses and they re-embarked for Muharraq Meanwhile two other boat-loads from Hidd had landed near the Wireless. I ordered Qosaibi, who was by this time genuinely alarmed at the Najdis being out of his effective control, to take immediate steps to turn them back which, with the example of the other boats returning to Muharraq, he was able to do. For the remainder of the day very wild rumours were afloat and the situation was not improved by the Sunnis of Budiayeh and Rafa seizing the opportunity to make an attack on the Shiah village of'Ali.T k J r On the 10th I thought it advisable to ask for a gunboat, to steady the situation and aliaj the panic 01 tne 1 ersians who were clamouring for protection The Per' sians continued to press me for a statement of the action I was taking to urotect them, so I again wired on 11th to ascertain whether a gunboat could be smred No reply was received that day. ^ On 12th I visited the town three times. It was quiet, but Naidis were still walking about armed with daggers and sticks, which the fidawis of the Shaiks were afraid to take from them. Throughout the proceedings no single arrest was effected Pending definite news of a gunboat, I ordered the Persians to remain in their houses and rtf^ain from opening their shops. On the afternoon of the 12th news ot the approaching arrival of gunboats was received, and at once had a good effect. Qosaibi was evidently frightened, as it was reported that he was making eftorts to get Sunm leaders to sign a memorial on his behalf to Shaik Easa. In discussing the situation with Shaik Selman, the latter expressed the opinion that the arrest of fe Qosaibi would be a good thing and wanted me to carry it out. When asked why none of the Shaiks would remonstrate with Qosaibi, let alone arrest him, he admitted that as Bin Saud's Agent, they were afraid to deal with him. I pointed out that although I decided cases in which foreigneis were concerned, the arrest of persons responsible for, or inducing, breaches of the peace, was the duty of the local Government. It was apparent that he wished me to order the arrest, thus enabling the Shaik to excuse themselves to Bin Saud that it was done under pressure from the Agency. In my opinion such action, since at that time there was' no gunboat, was best left alone. In an interview with Shaik Hamad the latter expressed, in confidence, his opinion that Qosaibi had planned the outbreak and had been preparing the Najdis for some days for it. My own opinion is, that if he did not actually prepare the outbreak, his action in regard to the watch episode which undoubtedly started the disturbance, was equally cu'pable. Statement of Mr. J. B. Mack ie of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. On Thursday, 10th, when the fracas between the Najdis and Persians oc curred, I was in my house, next to the Customs. I heard a crowd of people rush ing past and a lot of shouting ; one of the servants told me that a row had'started and the Persians were out to kill a Najdi. The servant himself was a Najdi. 1 took no notice until the disturbance increased. On going to the window I saw some 30 or 40 people running about collecting sticks and running off towards the Customs House. For the moment the disturbance near my house died down but shouting then began from the direction of the bazaar and in a minute or two the d sturbance again increased and a bedy of 50 or 60 people-armed with lathis appeared on the Customs pier. These were Arabs and th^y set about belabouring such Persian coolies as th ;y could find. I saw th^m beat one man almost to death in the water in front of my house and arioth r one on the Customs jetty. Seeing this going on I went round to Yusuf Kanoo's office to find out what was jjeally happening. I found the bazaar full of Arabs, shouting and carrying lathis. Inside Yusuf Kanoo's office was a Persian who had been badly knocked about, a id who had, I was told, been rescued from the crowd by Yusuf Kanoo and his nophew Ahmed. There was a big crowd of Arabs outside the office of Qosaibi and a dead Persian was lying at Qosaibi's door. Qosaibi was nowhere to be seen. I had just b( gun to make enquiries as to what was happening and had been in formed that the row began as the result of an altercation betwe n Abdulla Qosaibi and Mohamed Sherif arising out of the theft of a watch from Qosaibi which had been found in the possession of a Persian. Having got thus far I noticed that the crowd began to disperse as quickly as it could and saw the reason for this sudden dispersal was the arrival of the Politica]|Agent in his car, and later, on the arrival of the Agency guard the crowd dispersed entirely. I then accompanied the Political Agent around the bazaar. In the bazaar we found two dead Persians and one dead Arab, while on the Customs je tty and in boats tied up to the jetty we found two Persians and one Arab so badly beaten about that their recovery appeared improbable. Throughout the whole of this disturbance, I only actually saw one man with firearms and he was firing powde r. He was a Najdi. Ball ammunition, however, was being fired in the bazaar when the fight was in progress. 'While going through the bazaar we collected any lathis w£ saw. MC194FD• \ v 10 On the following morning Yusuf Kanoo and I were talking in my house of the even s of the day before and everything appeared quiet We decided to go to Ids office to hear what people had to say about it but found on our way. that the Khanbetween my house and his office, in which his Persian coolies live was closed and bolted He had the door opened and asked what the trouble was and they told us that the row had begun again. On emerging from the Khan we found a crowd of some 30 of 40 Arabs, about 30 per cent, of whom were armed withTathis and three or four with rifles, shouting around Qosaibi s office Yusuf Kanoo went to see what was afoot, ancLwas told that the Persian were all armed and had closed their shops and were mobilized m the Khans of Abun Nabi and Abul Qasim and the Najdis were mobilizing to defend themselves. A dulla Oosaibi was in his office and Yusuf and I went to see hmr and get him to quiet down the crowd of Najdis. He was however absolutely hopeless as he had no control over himself and was fuming and raging like a mad man and m fact he- haved in just the way to set things ablaze. Just as we were talki^ to him one man got up on a bench and began to ' Hawas and said he was ofi to raise the Naidis of Muharraq. I got hold of him and told Qosaibi to put him m his office and keep him there as he was a public danger and might easily start a fresh row. While Yusuf and Qosaibi had argument about what was to be done, 1 and one or two others helping me, collected lathis from the crowd and threw them away in the back of the Khan. Yusuf Kanoo and I then went down to the bazaar to see if it was really true that the Persian shops were closed and found that it was not so * we therefore came back and told the Najdis this and trie! to persuade them to go and open their shops and disperse. As we were doing this a crowd of Naidis armed with lathis and swords come from the direction of the Mespe s house and we sent Qosaibi off to meet and disperse them. This he managed to do. We then got Qosaibi into Yusuf Kanoo's office and tried to bring him to reason, but he was full of bluster and quite unable to think rationally. Shortly afterwards Shaik Selman came along and he and Qosaibi at once , got more or less at logger heads. Shaik Selman obviously realizing that the situation was serious wanted to get something done to settle things down. All that Qosaibi could talk about however was the events of the previous day, the iniquities of the Persian Police, who had, he declared, moved down the Arabs with their rifles, while at the same time he was full of the most absurd threats regarding what Bin Saud would do when he heard that one of his favourite slaves had been shot. Things were obviously not progressing so I suggested to Yusuf that he should advise Snaik Selman to go to the Customs House and send officially for Qosaibi and Mohamed Sherif and Abdun Nabi and try to work out between them some means of keeping order for the rest of Ramadhan at any rate. Qosaibi had repeatedly laid claim that 13 Najdis are missing and claims them as casualties ; he insisted too that nearly all their casualties are from gun-shot and that none of the Persian casual ties are. I do not think that his claim is at all probable unless casualties took place in some other part of the bazaar. I do not see who could have removed the corpses or the wounded, as we had the greatest difficulty in getting the wounded and dead men shifted. As Shaik Selman reached the Customs house the Political Agent arrived and by then the crowd had mostly dispersed and everything seemed quiet again and I went home. About noon I heard a lot of 4 Hawasing ' from the direction of Muharraq and saw four or five boats full of men coming towards Manameh. They drew in to the land near the Agency and the men got out of the boat into the water, put up flags and again began to ' Hawas '. Through field glassed I saw a crowd of Arabs go to the shore to meet them and after some time during which the ' Hawas ' conti nued and a few shots were fired N the Muharraq men got into their boats anid went back. I understood afterwards that this was a Najd contingent from Muharraq coming to take revenge for those who had been killed the day before and there is - no doubt that had they got into Manameh they would have caused serious havoc and loss of life as they were really heavily armed with rifles. The 12th May 1923. (Sd.) J. B. MacKIE. , Mr. T. D. Bora, Director of Customs, states as follows : — ' I saw the fray between the Najdis and Persians near the Customs. I don t know how it started, but lots of armed Najdis came and beat and injured any /Persian they could see. I saw no armed Persians., Sucii as were about tried to run away. There are all sorts of rumours as to the cause of the row which cannot be believed. I only know that Abdulla Qosaibi could have stopped it if he wanted to, but he is hot headed and impetuous. He is full of ideas of importance of his position as Bin Sand's Agent. In his trade dealings with people he is very over bearing and not straight and people fear his methods and ability to use force,' Question. —Do you think that if a steady man had been in charge of the Najdis he could have stopped the outbreak 1 Answer. —Yes, I am-quite sure of it. Question. —Do you think that with Abdulla Qosaibi in charge, peace will be kept between Najdis and other communities 1 Answer. —No I don't think so ; he is not a peaceful man. (Sd.) T. D. BOEA. M12 i 9 - APPENDIX II TO REPORT ON BAHRAIN REFORMS. Com of a letter from the Hon hie the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, to His Highness the Sultan of Nejd and Dependencies, dated Bahrain, the 18th May 1923 {2 Shawwat). Translation. My friend! It cannot have been concealed from \ our Excellency that, in the Town of Manameh, there have recently been deplorable outbreaks of religious fanaticism which have resulted on serious loss of life among both Nejdis and Persians. It has found necessary for me to visit these Islands, enquire into the origin of these disturbances and endeavour to^riange that such distressing fatali ties do not recur. I deeply regret to inform you that the reports I have received establish beyond a doubt that the Nej ad were tjie aggressors and that your Agent Abdulla Al-Qosaibi, after absurd pretensions to arrogate to himself the functions of a Consul which have been for some time causing me anxuty not only instigated these disturbances but behaved, after they were set afoot, in a manner both unseemly and cowardly and thereby has brought discredit—as far as such an insignificant person may do—on Your Highness' good name. I hold this man primarily responsible for the blood of these unfortunate mis guided rioters and would have dealt with h : m severely but for the fact that he, however unworthy, has been honoured with your confidence. I have accordingly set him free to carry this letter to you, so that Your Highness may dral with him as in your wisdom you think fit. Moreover in view of his past conduct and the difficulties it has given rise to, I must ask that Your Highnesss should not send an Agent to Bahrain without consulting the British Government* whether such person be acceptable to them. His Excellency the High Commissioner in ' Iraq, Sir Henry Dobbs, has in formed me that on the departure of our friend Bir Percy Cox, I have been selected as the intermediary between Your Highness' Government and the Colonial Office of His Majesty's Government. It is a matter of the liv'liest personal regret to me that just after I have been honoured by this selection, my first official communication to Your Highness should be on such an unpleasant subject. The urgency of the case and the deplor able consequences of the conduct of Abdulla A1 Qosaibi are my only excuse and just fication. This is what had to be said. May Your Highness be long preserved in peace and honour and Salaam. [Note. —Orginal not reproduced.]13 APPENDIX III TO REPORT ON BAHRAIN REFORMS. Speech made by the Hon'hie Lieutenant-Colonel S. G. Knox, C.S.L, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at the Majlis convened in Bahrain on the 26th May 1923. 3 Gentlemen : You have just heard read to you the letter in which Shaikh Hamad announces to you that he has, in obedience to the orders of the British Government, taken over the administration of these Islands as his father's fully empowered Agent. Some of you present here to-day may remember what was the state of these Islands when fifty-five years ago Shaikh'Isa was summoned by His Majesty's Government to take his seat as Shaikh. These Islands were then exposed to the full blast of in ternecine strife, rapine and disorder. His father, Shaikh Ali, had been killed in the fighting that had taken place a few months before. For fifty-five years his rule has been blessed with peace and, on the whole, good orders. He has been a steady loyal friend of the British Government and the Islands have undoubtedly progressed in wealth, population, commerce and agriculture. The Islands of Bahrain are ever watched by covetous eyes on both sides of the Persian Gulf and the fifty-five years of Shaikh 'Isa's rule have been no mean achievement. I am sure I may speak confidently on behalf of this assembly of Bahrain Notables when I say that we ali thank him for what he has done for these Inlands : he leaves no enemy or ill-wisher behind him and we all wish him still many happy years of well-earned retirement after the labour and fatigue of so many years of arduous rule. Recent deplorable events, on which I have no wish to dwell on this occasion, have merely emphasized and accentuated an insistent cry for reform of the ad ministration on modern lines and there is, after all, nothing surprising in the fact that a man who has reached the ripe age of seventy-five years has not been found capable of responding to this demand. For some years. Shaikh Tsa's easy tolerant rule—some may perhaps call it misrule : I personally prefer to call it lack of rule—- has led to the growth of a number of petty tyrannies and independencies which were fast crystallising into vested interests an4 seriously weakening the Administra tion. Rights were being lost which it wou'd be hard to recover and the British Government, locking to the general good, have in their wisdom decided that it is time that new blood was introduced and the Administration strengthened. Shaikh 'Isa is still titular Shaikh of these Islands and Shaikh Hamad is only his Agent, although the fully empowered Agent for his father, and he has assumed a very difficult and thankless task. Gentlemen, you know Shaikh Hamad far better than I, a foreigner, can know him. You know he is a modest, unassuming man, but I should like to tell you that throughout the negotiations that have preceded this decision. Shaikh Hamad has valiantly fought for his father's retention and it was no greed for power that led him to assume the Administration. It is rather regard for his father s good name, for the benefit of the Al-Khalifa and for the welfare of. the Sunni community that has induced him, despite some diffidence, to take upon his shoulders the weight aild burden of the Administration. He relies greatly on the promise oi unstinted and loyal assistance from his brother Shaikh Abdullah, and I am here, as the mouthpiece of my Government, to promise the help of that Government to Shaikh Hamad in all paths of lawful endeavour both against externa] aggression and internal sedition. It is quite possible that many of you present here to-day, especially Sunnis, may view with regret the disappearance of a Sunni ruler who has ruled oyer you for so many years. It is a very natural feeling and I venture to express the very earnest hope, almost the belief, that our proceedings to-day will eventually ten to the uplift and special progress of the Sunni Community. Ever p mce sorr ^ e twenty years ago Shaikh 'Isa in his wisdom handed over to the Political Agen , Bahrain, the administration over and direct responsibility for foreigners, ere have been practically two Governments working side by side in Bahrain. Une has been open and above-board and has resulted in an enormous influx ot toreigners to these Islands and I beliefe that I shall not be accused of exaggeration i say that the proportion of foreigners has during the last twenty years progressed as MC194FD14 20- land their wealth as 100:1. I really heUeve I am understating facts. Oil the other hand, the other Government has been, so to speak behind a pnrdah and the Snnni commnnity and its rider have been apt to stand aloof and distinct from other communities and, although there has no doubt been some progress they otber GQnmim _ f * Tt is my earnes t hope, which T am confident is fullv shared bv Shaikhs Hamad and Abdullah and by the Political Agent, that the measures of reform we initiate to-day will bring the Sunm commumtv into Ime S other communities. They will pull their weight in the boat and have as is their birthright, a preponderating voice in the administration of these Islands so that in spit; of some natural regrets, we can look forward with some confi dence to a bright and happy future for the Sunm community. I must now give mv first warning, which is to those who collect the main revenues of these Islands-the Customs revenues-that after deduction of nece*- sarv working expenses, they must pay all such revenues to Shaikh Hamad and o Shaikh Hamad alone. No drafts except those signed by lum on the Customs should be honoured. Infringements of this rule will entail dismissal and the personal responsibility of the guilty party. Mv second warning is to the Qazis. We shall preserve the Shara Law and the Shara Courts to the fullest possible extent and we have no wish to fetter litigants or those who seek arbitration, from free recourse to Shara but any Qazi who per mits the interference or advocacy of influential persons or their submitting cases to Shara will be dismissed from his appointment, be he Sunm or Shiah. The onlv persons who have the power to commit cases to Shara are Shaikh Hamad and the Political Agent, Bahrain, or their regularly appointed deputies. Qazis are expected to be vigilant against these abuses' and to defeat these attempts by suspending cases and reporting to Shaikh Hamad or the Political Agent, Bahrain, as mav seem most convenient or expedient in the particular case. T repeat that the free intercourse of litigants themselves direct to Shara is a right which, bod ^ forbid ! I or anyone else should interfere with. Attempts by unauthorized persons to usurp executive or judicial authority will be resented and punished, particularly attempts by persons who constitute themselves leaders of any community as has been done m the past- Gentlemen of the Al-Khalifa : I am afraid that looking to the past it is my duty to warn you that you must not expect that because you have taken the trouble to be born you have therefore a right to live on the rest of the community, whether by allowances from the revenues of these Islands or by preying on the poor and helpless. s ' He who will not work, neither shall he eat ' is a good motto and you had better apply it to your own case. Those of you who lend your energies to assisting Shaikh Hamad in his thankless task of raising the Government of these Islands to the plgjie of modern civilization will be liberally rewarded and given opportunities of exercis ing such talents as God has given you. Those who sit still and do nothing must be content with a bare pittance for subsistence. Those who do mischief will be cut of! absolutely and punished accordingly. In any case, it is Shaikh Hamad to whom all classes must now look for reward and punishment and the. British Gov ernment, here by my mouth, promises him full support in all lawful exercise of authority. I endeavour to turn your thoughts to education and the means of earning an honest living for you are too numerous for ail to find places in the ad ministration and I fear, owing to neglect, many are not competent. Gentlemen of the Sunni persuasion and especially the Dawasir tribesmen : It is for you to understand that we mean to establish the rule of these Islands under a Shaikh of the Al-Khalifa and that the Shaikh's rights are going to be enforced equally over all to the best of Shaikh Hamad's ability and in such attempts he will have our full support. You have frequently met such threats in the past by a counter threat to leave these Islands in a body and go over to Bin Saud or others. If that is your intention, in God's name, go ; but if you resign as a protest, do not be surprised if your lands and houses are confiscated to the State and given to others, and I can assure you that there will be no lack of applicants. These Islands are not date gardens in desert Arabia where tlie proprietors roam the15 desert the whole year round only returning to eat the fruit of their gardens at ths time of harvest. I do not mean it to be understood that the mere departure of a proprietor on business to Bombay o^ pilgrimage to the Haj or other lawful occa sions will be the signal for the Shaikh to confiscate the property left behind, but I do mean that those who behave contumaciously may find themselves dealt with stringently. We have no use for absentee landlords or persons owning a double allegiance. I fear that in the East this merely means playing off one ruler against another and consistently betraying both. If you reside in the Islands of Bahrain, you must, while owning property there, conform to the rule of the country and pay the customary dues, nor can we tolerate an imperium in imperio. Gentlemen of th} Shi ah persuasion and especially those indigenous to these Islands! I wish you particularly to weigh the following remarks. Much of the agita tion of recent years has been fictitious. I am far from saying that you have had no cause for complaint but what I mean to say is that I cannot subscribe to the opinion that recent misrule is either more tyrannical or more flagrant than it has often been in the past. The state of these Islands, the signs of additional wealth that meet the eye everywhere around give the lie to the contention that misrule has been persistent and is increasing. We have admitted some abuses and an nounced our intention of fighting them. But I want you to remember that this is a Sunni country and surrounded on this shore of the Gulf by powerful Sunni communities who watch our proceedings with vigilant interest and no small degree of suspicion. You must not expect equality at a bound and Sunni privileges can not be swept away at once, if at all. As Shaikh Hamad has told you, we shall endeavour to see that you know to what extent you are being taxnd, that taxes are levied equally and not arbitrarily, that you remain in quiet enjoyment of the fruits of your labour and that you are not exposed to outrage of any kind as you have, I fear, sometimes been in the past, and I look to you for loyal support of Shaikh Hamad who promises to protect you against oppression and exaction. You have found recently that you have a voice, and foreign advisers have taught you how to use it. Be careful that you do not, by clamouring unjustly, destroy the benefits you may reasonably expect from the inauguration of the present r g m\ To you, gentlemen, who, to use a legal tag, are foreigners within the meaning of the Bahrain Order in Council, I have little to say. The jurisdiction over foreigners will continue to be exercised m the future, as it has been in the past, by the Political Agent. I believe it has been to your benefit and that you are reasonably content with it. One thing no o o will deny, that since StiaiKu Isa, in his wisdom, entrusted foreign cases to the Poiiticai Agent, the number of foreign ers, their wealth, importance and weight in the community has increased in a manner that is little short of amazing. It does not seem as if people would flock here to the extent they do, if they were dissatisfied under the conditions under which they live Shaikh Hamad, however, expressly authorises me to say that he will welcome comments and criticism and that he will lend a sympathetic ear to all that may tend to increase the wealth, comfort and general well-being of the town oi Manameh in which foreigners preponderate to such an extent that it may almost be said to have been made by them. Gentlemen, I have kept you an unreasonable time and yet no speech in Bahrain would he complete without a word on the subject that must be uppermost in the minds of those who live in Bahrain-the pearl trade. It is the source of the wealth of these Islands. It furnishes the reason why foreigners flock here m such numbers and build fine houses and on it are founded the prosperity, cleanliness and well-being of Man^meh. And yet, I know, the I ohtical Agent knows, Shai v.i Hamad knows, the Qazi, Shaikh Jasim bin Mehza, and you all know, and above all, the divers know that it is the plague spot of these Islands We all know that labour is in a position little short of lifelong slavery and that trickery, fraud and oppression are rampant in the Trade ; and what are any of us doing to remove there evils ? It is almost impossible to get respectable people to serve in the Salifa Court, Nakhodas steadily refuse to produce their accounts ; if they did, divers; who are dumb driven cattle, would not understand them ; and yet, who cares or gives real thought to all this suffering ? You can register divers you can even reform the Salifa 'Court, you can imprison Nakhodas, compel theni to furnish accounts, and yet, even in that way you will not go far. lou must begin at the16 bottom with the lowest cla-^ ^ ^ in the slack season, in habits of tlinft wm^wiu ren^^^ ^ ^ ^; khodas d0i m and its oppressive usur y in ® , t ] eave those among you who wish them WHoiroirthe way' Shaikh Hamad and the Political Agent can d, little but practical, cautious philanthropists can do a great dea . (N B.—The speech now passed into Arabic.) i -i t • And now Shaikh Hamad, I ask you to bear with me while I give you some advice for the future. I have already spoken to you on the subject and for one word I say to you now I speak six to my other hearers. ,, T i. j Mv first piece of advice is ' Fear two : first God and then, fear . I had almost reversed the order, for Allah is the merciful, the compassionate, the mild and the generous, while fear is the hated enemy. „ Mv second piece of advice is, ' Avoid two things : hate and love They are the ''wasamain 11 ' (camel -marks) of the weak man and however harmless a weak man may be as a merchant or a cooly, he is useless as a ruler. Mv third piece of advice is in regard to rewards and punishments the two • i nf a ruler. In regard to both of these, follow the rules of the British Man-6f-War and let twenty-four hours elapse between the act and its recompense whether that recompense be good or evil. Examine yours 3 lf if your heart is cold and if yon find it not so, wait another four and twenty hours. Then 1600 AnTnow 0 Hamad ! I will tell you a story that I heard here of what took place the other day when there was an assembly much like the present one, to celebrate a School Prizegiving. Most of the scholars received rewards but one, who probably did not deserve one, began to whimper and the headmaster ear ng that he would spoil the tamasha, led him up to you and explained that by some mistake this boy had been forgotten. Whereupon, 0 Hamad'.you pulled out a gold watch from your pocket and presented it to this whimpering little boy and another member of the Al-Kbalifa, not to be outdone in generosity gave him £5 and I have no doubt that the assembly jWent out saying what noble-iiearted open- handed gentlemen you were. It sounds like a story from the Arabian lights or the spacious days of Haroun al Rashid. Now I tell you 0 Hamad ! that your conduct on this occasion was absolutely rotten. It was bad for the boy himself, it was bad for the other boys and if you eo on on such principles, you will not, 0 Hamad, last six months. Thirty years have I worked with Hakims great and small and yet never have I known or met the Hakim who was not in need of money for public needs. The Political Agent is hard put to it for want of money, I am cramped for lack of funds, Persia and Iraq and France are on the verge of bankruptcy and Germany has fallen over the precipice. The Government of India is reducing its establishments and dismissing its servants and the Government of London is doing likewise and who are you, 0 Hamad, that you should be better than they ? You have rich and ample revenues but I shall be greatly surprised to learn that they amount to as much as Re, 1 per month per head of the population of these Islands : and yet, all these men, women and children look to you, 0 Hamad, for their moral uplift, sanitation and progress. And how much uplift, sanitation and progress are you going to effect for Re. 1 per head per month and how much will be left over for giving gold watches, and five-pound notes to little whimpering boys for a term's W( J r k, o r, f or that matter, for motor cars or motor boats for the members of the Al-Khalita . In all private expenditure, 0 Hamad, you must be a miser and it is only when you entertain projects that will bring money out of money and projects for the general advancement of your people that you must spend money with both hands. If you will follow these four precepts and people curse you, as people will curse a Hakim, go on your way without flinching. If they praise you to your face, examine yourself and ask in your heart ' Where, 0 Hamad, hast thou erred . And in conclusion, my friend (and here I took him by the hand), blessings and prosperity on your rule. Note. T ie speach was well received anJ Shaikh Hamad, though he might have resented some of this public plain-speaking, appeared genuinely delighted with it. Even Yusuf bin Ahmed Kanoo, our caustic critic, was moved to enthusiasm and said that Hamad should have kissed my hands and head for the Arabic advice. Read in cold blood and in an English translation it sounds silly in the extreme but one must recollect the. primitive folk to whom it was addressed. S. G. KNOX.17 APPENDIX IV TO REPORT ON BAHRAIN REFORMS. Translation of Speech made by Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa Al-Khalija at the Majlis convened in Bahrain on the 26th May 1923. Gentlemen,—In obedience to the orders of the High Government, to-day I assume on my shoulders the responsibility of the Government of this country with the object of preserving the honour of my dear father and to serve the family of Al-Khalifa and the public. I will do my utmost for the welfare of the subjects of His Excellency my respected father and, as you are perfectly aware. His Excel lency my father has always been solicitous to preserve peace, order and prosperity in his country and I shall endeavour to follow in his footsteps. Moreover, gentle men, I know, as also you all know, that, cd; recent years, there has been a great progress in civilization and prosperity in all towns in this world and why should our dear native country not follow their example ? I say that my chief duty is cheer fully to attempt to promote the prosperity of my dear native country, the spread of education and public sanitation, to encourage commerce and agriculture. I thank Almighty God for my good fortune in that my brother. Shaikh Abdullah, on whom I fully rely, has promised me his assistanca in-Council and to co-operate in settl ing Government affairs. From the love I bear to my dear country I desire that all in my town attend to their own business, that the merchant busy himseJf in his mercantile affairs and others follow each the work by which he earns his livelihood and the peasant concern himself with his cultivation. I say confidently that if I find persons intriguing against the nations or indulg ing in any mischievous actions or disturbance, I will take the necessary action for his chastisement. Gentlemen, I inform you that in futue I will not suffer the intermediation of anyone on behalf of any culprit to prevent his being punished as he deserves, so it is useless for anyone to trouble himself in such matters. Also I seize this occasion to acquaint you that I intend to safeguard the income and rights of my Government. After the deduction of the salaries of those who assist Govern ment and are entitled to receive salary and after the de duction of other necessary expenditure by Government servants on Government account, this is my first duty. The balance of the income and taxes will be kept with me and earmarked for the improvement, promotion and extension of the commerce of my country and f or such ends as may lead to the improvement of the condition of my country and Government. In these circumstances, I am responsible before the public not to waste public funds. I shall carefully consider and make the necessary arrangement regarding taxation, so that it may fall equally on all and that the amount of the tax should be openly known, so that no official can recover more than the fixed amount. This what had to be said and in conclusion I- sincerely thank the High Government for their valuable assistance to us in the past and I hope that they will assist us and our Government in future in public progress and the exten sion df our subjects' trade and that friendly relations will be maintained between us. I also thank the Hon'ble Colonel Knox, C.S.I., C.I.E., the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for the assistance afforded by him to us and in conclusion, gentlemep, accept my gratitude and respect. . — [iVofe.— -Original not reproduced.] G.

Although the Government of India had urged that provision should be made in the order for the deportation of foreigners, it was decided that in the absence of any specific delegation from the Shaikh of Bahrein, the power to deport foreigners could not be given to the Political Agent; and it was in consequence omitted from the revised order. ®P ec ^ c ( ^ e ^ e S a ^ on - ia - s now been given by Shaikh Hamad, heir-apparent of Shaikh Isa, and (as reported in Colonel Knox's despatchf 250-S. of May 31st last) the present 'de facto' ruler of Bahrein, who has addressed a letter to the Political Agent requesting the British Government to give their Political Agent at Bahrein lawful authority ' to deport ' mischievous foreigners I enclose one Arabic! copy of that letter and 3 copies of an English translation. Recent circumstances, and in particular the cases of Haji Abdul Nabi of Bahrein and Jasim al Chirawi, have shown how desirable it is that the Political Agent should be legally empowered to deport foreigners from the Island and that the present anomalous position should be regularized in which foreigners can take advantage of the immunity they enjoy under British protection to indulge in political intrigue against us. And in view of Shaikh Hamad's definite request, I am directed to ask that the Government of India will be pleased to move His Majesty's Government to amend the present Order-in-Council for Bahrein, so as to provide the Political Agent with the necessary power, by substituting in articles 21 arid 22 for the expression ' British subject ' the expression ' person to whom this Order applies • Enclosure to Serial No. (107). ~ [Translation].

After expression of the best compliments to your high dignity and the mercy of God and His blessings for ever I have to state, my friend, that I under stood from Your Excellency that some doubts have occurred in the opinions of the illustrious High Government about the justice laws regarding the authority of the Political Agent at Bahrein for repatriating the foreigners who make mis chief in the country, who intrigue against my Government by creating difference between the community of Nations or making intrigues which may be disrespect ful to my Government and lead to disorder of my country. Also I understood from ^ our Excellency that it would be useful to the High Government if I state my object in this connection in a clear manner. My friend, since the transfer of the execution of the justice laws on the foreigners in my country to the Political Agent of the Government at Bahrein up 1 o now I was certain that owing to the transfer of all those justice laws the right of repatriation was included in it. As I am certain of this undoubtedly all the people of the country understand it. To render easy for the Government in organizing the justice laws I, Hamad ben Isa ben Ali Al-Khalifah, say that my object is that the High Government give a lawful authority to the Political Agent at Bahrein for the reprtriation of the mischievous foreigners and also the Political Agent put this law in force in time of need so that there may be always peace and tranquility in my country. The said Political Agent should repatriate from our country the mischievous *See Pro. Nos. 16— 18 and 20 in S. E., July 1913, N ob. 16—41. tSerial No. (106). J Not reproduced.

Since your recent departure from Bahrein I have been very fully occupied, in consultation with Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla, in reducing to some order, the chaotic state of the local finances. The preliminary work was complicated by the necessity for a very early determination of the allowances to be made to the various members of the Al-Khalifah family, for the Arabic month was drawing to a close, and many of them, cut off from their usual source of supply (they were in the habit of drawing supplies in kind without any limit, leaving Shaikh Easa to foot the bill), were in need of funds. ^ Preliminary allowances, subject to future revision, have been determined. Throughout I have borne in mind the paramount necessity for economy in order that funds may gradually be accumulated to meet the expenditure for the intro duction of the reforms required by His Majesty's Government. Allowances to Al-Khalifah family, as now arranged, amount to some Ks. 30,000 per mensem. This does not include a considerable pensions list and the monthly salaries of officials of all classes. In some cases allowances have had to be increased, to allow for the fact that, in future, no member of the family will be entitled to purchase require ments at the expense of the state. Every person to whom an allowance has been made will have to make it suffice for his needs and has been clearly given to under stand that no extra bills can be run up. This system will effectually put a stop to the incredible waste of public money which has been permitted in the past I estimate that about half a lakh per mensem has been spent unnecessarily in the past, in addition to cash allowances drawn. Of this sum approximately 25 per cent, was clear profit to 'Ali bin Abdulla, uncle of the notorious Jasim Chirawi, who charged for all supplies at most exorbitant rates and whose accounts were subject to no check and were, in addition, full of arithmetical mistakes in his own favour. Allowances have been made on a scale which I consider to be extremely generous. It was not however deemed advisable to make too drastic cuts but to concentrate our efforts in stopping sheer waste and to take steps to put an end to the very serious leakage in the Customs Revenue. After much discussion it was decided that Shaikh Easa should be accorded a monthly allowance of Rs. 4,000. In addition he will draw annually an allowance of Rs. 2,000, in a lump sum to meet extra expenditure due to the annual move to Manamaeh for the summer months. In addition to this, he has an income of not less than Es. 2,500 per mensem from gardens, etc., which he is retaining, and his wife has amassed considerable wealth and has-an income from property given her by Shaikh Easa. Shaikh Easa is highly dissatisfied with this arrangement and considers the allowance quite insufficient, although he has been relieved of every expense except the upkeep of his personal establishment. Certain interested persons, of whom I believe Yusuf Kanoo to be the chief, have put it into his head that he should have at least Rs. 15,000 per mensem. Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla both agree that the allowance made is more than sufficient, though it cannot of course meet wasteful expenditure in the nature of cash presents to any and every beduin who comes begging. The burden of entertainment has been entirely transferred to Hamad, and Shaikh Easa has very little to do, of that nature.' He has taken up the attitude that he prefers to take nothing and can manage on his private income. 'He told his sons that he would not take Rs. 10,000 per mensem if it were offered to him. I was about to refer to you tb ask for authority to tell the Shaikh that the allowance was considered ample, when Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla again called on me. ^ heir view is that the old man is quite childish and is encouraged by his wife and one or two persons, such as ^ usuf Kanoo, who has his own motives. They suggest that Aye shall instruct .the Bank to pay his allowance into a private account and leave it at that, and that the Shaikh will certainly be glad to avail himself of the money at no very distant date. This we have decided to do, and trust it will meet with your approval.l%tL t leen ecoii( ure fey 1, to A im purcki® 'j$mk 'rastic eiik|j. itopntaJ® lid be 35- e an iMfl® retaiiiiii| a md cdtej ^ y exp® 360 ^ &lt; 77 Shaikli Hamad has agreed to, and lias actually appointed the Eastern Bank Limited as his State Bank and the balance at the Customs and the daily receipts are now lodged in the Bank, The Bank have agreed to do more than is generally required of a Bank, and will maintain various funds, keep detailed accounts, keep pass-books in Arabic, make monthly payments to the Khalifeh family as directed and pay all Government Officials. They will in fact assist the Shaikh in all financial- matters required Of them, and will act in the capacity of his State Accounts Depart ment. This has already enormously simplified matters and has done away with the necessity for discovering efficient and honest accountants, a task of which both the Shaikhs and I were inclined to despair. Arrangements have already been made and instructions issued to the Bank to transfer to separate funds, from the genera] fund, a monthly sum to meet the expenditure which can be definitely foreseen under various budget headings. This will ensure our not having to sudden ly draw on the general funds, which we have earmarked to meet expenditure on reforms in the administration and public works. Examples of the separate funds referred to are—• 1. Religious festivals fund —a small sum will be transferred to this monthly and accumulate, to be expended twice yearfy on Eid presents, which are customary and cannot well be avoided by the Kuler. 2. Summer move fund —to meet the extra expenditure involved by the annual summer move which for various reasons is considerable and would be met with difficulty from existing allowunces of Al-Khalifeh, who are too improvident ty keep anything in hand. 3. Launch fund. —With the object of having a sufficient sum in hand to meet expenditure on coal and stores without drawing on the general fund. 4. A reserve fund—to which a small monthly sum will be transferred with the object of forming a reserve to meet any unforseen extra expenditure by the Ruler, such as a state visit to India or reception of another ruler, etc. Also a Public Works Fund, etc. Apart from these payments and the monthly salaries due on the Civil list, the balance of the general fund will be available for public expenditure. II.—Customs. The reorganisation of the Customs, which is the principal source of Revenue is the paramount necessitv of the moment. Leakage is very evident and must 'amount to a very large monthly sum. To enable the Bahrein Government to have its finances in a state to meet expenditure for reforms, it is absolutely neces sary that the- Customs should be at once attended to. A cursory examination of the accounts has brought to light much embezzlement on the pait of the late Direc tor. For example, Yusuf Kanoo and Yusuf Fakroo were permitted to settle their Customs once a year, when the Director came from Karachi personally for the purpose. Their payments were never credited in the Customs books, but were credited in the books of the Director's private firm of Gangaram Tikamdas. The latter's excuse to Yusuf Kanoo and members of his own firm, was that Shaikh Easa was so improvident that he thought it better to keep this money up his s eeve in case he might need financial help in the future! The Director recently died and the Shaikh's Government are due something over a lakh on the Customs books and an unknown sum which has been embezzled over a long term of years, m respect of the Customs paid by Yusuf Kanoo and a few others. f It does not need enquiry to gather that Yusuf Kanoo and the few others who shared the benefit of settling annually, also received some quid pro quo for keeping silent in the matter of the embezzlement. There are countless ways m which Customs revenue is lost to the Government which it would be tedious to refer to here. - ■ To put the Customs straight will require the services of an expert and the Shaikhs agree that thereafter they will probably wish to employ a British Director of Cus^onxs Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla have requested me to apply for assistance from Government. They ask if the service of an experienced customs officer could be78 lent, for say a month, or whatever time would be required to reorganize the Customs. On receipt of his recommendations the future stafl could be decided upon and the question of the appointment of a permanent Director settled. I beg to request that if possible, the visit of such an official be arranged uregntly. If the customs could be put in order very early, there is every reason to believe that sufficient funds could be accumulated by the end of the hot weather to enable us to stait in earnest with reforms next cold weather. If the matter could be arranged telegraphically it would be worth while and any expenditure involved would be refundable immediately by the Bahrein Government. If an official can be spared, I request that I may be given as early intimation as possible of the probable ap proximate cost of his visit to the Bahrein Government in order that I may assist the Shaikhs to make proper financial provision. 111. — Government Offices. A Government Office has been established in Manameh where, in future, Shaikh Hamad will transact his official business. It is being putin charge of a capable and enlightened Arab and run on efficient lines. A start is about to he made with nucleus of a Revenue Department and arrangements made whereby Revenue will be collected only by responsible persons and the sums due clearly shewn over Shaikh Hamad's seal. Inhabitants have the option of coming to head quarters and paying their revenue direct to the head office. It has been explained that the existing taxation system (or rather lack of system) must be adhered to for the time being until the whole question has been exhaustively considered by the Ruler in consultation with me. The announcement has nevertheless caused great joy among the Baharaneh who thus escape the persecution of fidawis: IV.—Survey of Bahrein Islands and towns. Before the revenue system can be overhauled or the registration of property take place on the lines of the Iraq Tapu system, which the ruler welcomes, it is absolutely necessary to have the islands accurately surveyed. I am to request that Government be asked to once more assist the Ruler of Bahrein to put his house in order, by supplying the necessary personnel for the survey, which might conve niently commence next October, if feasible. The entire expense would be borne by the Bahrein Government and provided the Customs can be put in order early, I anticipate there will be ample funds for the purpose. It would perhaps be well if the matter could be arranged early as some months would inevitably elapse before final arrangements could be made. It would be of great assistance if I could be furnished with a rough e&amp;timate of the probable cost to the Bahrein Government of the survey. G. M.

Sheikh also required Ahmed give document to the effect that if he is heareafter guilty of intrigues (against ?) Bahrein Sheikh in or out of Bahrein he will be liable to deportation by Bahrein Government and forfeiture of property. Sheikh convinced this would deter him from any appeal to Bin Saud. I agree. Ahmad makes some difficulty about the document and Sheikh asks whether I advise him to insist. We think that he will yield to slight pressure such as removal to His Majesty's Ship. He is no longer supported by remainder of Dowa- sir and document purely personal. Weakening by Sheikh at this stage might encourage appeal to Bin Saud. Please telegraph early whether you advise Sheikh should insist. Ends. I see no necessity for Sheikh to insist on document mentioned. I find these bonds not to intrigue under pain of forfeiture rather embarrassing and they give rise to false impressions that subjects can bargain with their ruler. In that respect they are truly Oriental though not unprecedented in the West.

I agree with Major Daly that the reorganization of the Customs is the essential preliminary to the introduction of Reforms in Bahrein ; and his arguments and proposals have my full concurrence. I hope that the Government of India will oe pleased to give their support to Shaikh Hamad's request for the loan of an ex perienced British Customs officer. Expert advice is indispensable if the Customs are to be placed on a sound basis. In a separate communication I have suggested the deputation of a British Customs officer to Kuwait for the examination of the Customs records at that port with a view to the settlement of the difficulties that have arisen between the Amir of Nejd and the Shaikh of Kuwait over the transit dues of the lormer. I hope that the Shaikh will agree to this deputation—which indeed would commit him to nothing—and could only be productive of great profit to his admi nistration and if so it would seem a natural and obvious arrangement that the sr.me officer deputed to Bahrein should go to Kuwait. The whole business would, I estimate, take him three months at most, and the extra expenses would be borne by the Bahrein and Kuwait revenues. Major Daly asks that this matter be arranged telegraphically : and I agree it is 1 T I J 1 P ortant that this preliminary work be carried out with the minimum of delay. overnment agree, therefore, I beg to ask for the favour of telegraphic inform- ati on so that I may approach the Bo mbay Government for the loan of a Customs * Smfil No. 123. t Serial No. 124.

XV—Survey of Bahrein Islands and Iown. . ^ These proposals are perhaps a little premature, and mi|iit properly follow- later after the successful introduction of the more important preliminary measures already discussed. If the Government of India agree in principle I shall be in a position to approach the Iraq Government at the proper time with a view to secur- hia the loan of an experienced revenue officer and staff for the purpose. 6 So much for the details of the preliminary plan of campa.gn As to their • eeneral effect, they clearly lay themselves open to the comment that their tendency I to hitrodnce straightway into the administration of Bahrem a jreponderatmg British^ element. It cannot be denied that this is so. With a British State Bank, f British judicial officer, a British Customs adviser, possibly also a British Revenue expert all combining to usher in the new regime under the superv lsl on of a British PolSckl Agent it is idle to expect any other interpretation of the situation than S ub Uie introduction of a process Jf anglicizing Bahrem. The encased copy of a report which I have just received from my Dragoman m Bushire illustrates the popular view in Bahrein to-day, which will be the popular view throughout the Gulf to-morrow. ^ • ,1 But it is difficult to see how this can be avoided. It is true that m ray telegram nf tli.. 15th Mav (No B. I.) I suggested that Hamad might be left to carry out le- hetanftS; as thiy suggested themselves, without — ^ing WUto anything like a definite programme—though even then I anticipated t e danger that the whole management of affairs might fall more and more into the power of the Political Agent. But once you step on to the path of reform, it is impossible to where you will he led. The first inspection of affairs m Bahrem has ( onymced the Pohtical Agent— and I entirely agree with him-that ' ^ respects is an unavoidable Trst step. It is impossible to expect Shaikh Hamad to be able to carry out these first steps without our assistance and very na t u ™ should ask us, who have taken on ourselves to depose his father al ' d P ut d his place, to assume a large measure of responsibility. In fairnees ^ Ha ™ d we cannot absolve ourselves of this responsibility whatever unfavourable conse quences may result from the hostile interpretations of ignorance. ^ ^ His Maiesty's Government have pledged themselves to reforming the adnimis- tration of Bahrein, and I believe that reform is really to* be mtroduced on soun lines, the new ruler must rely at the beginning almost solely on British suppor , guidance in the various technical difficulties that demand a settlement. I am at any rate glad to be able to report even at this early stage of the new regime that Shaikh Hamad for his part while showing a friendly desne to le ^ n ° the Political Agent's support and guidance regarding administrative ques 10 , is-proving that he is quite prepared to shoulder his own responsibilities m su matters as affect his own position and authority as ruler of Bahrein.

He intends to remove him from the recognized leadership of tha tribe and to instal Easa A1 Dosari who is a far more suitable person. He also proposes to deal with the 'Ali case summarily. It would take an indefinite time to examine the hundreds of witnesses who would be produced on either side and would still further unsettle the tribes and Baharinah. The Shara court would drag the case on for months, equally without result, and the Baharinah would not accept a deci sion of the Su'nm Qadhi and vice versa. It is the Shaikh 's intention in addition to the removal of Ahmad A\ Dosari from the leadership, to recover from the Budaiyah the cash equivalent of all the property looted from 'Ali, and payment, in accordance with custom, of blood money for the killed and wounded, together with a sufficient fine from the Government of Bahrain for the disorder caused. He will hold the elders of the Dowasir responsible for payment in a given time. They are well capable of dividing it among themselves according to the share they took in the fray and doubtless Ahmad Al Dosari and Khamis and their followers, who instigated the whole affair, will have to pay the biggest-share. I do not anticipate that there will be trouble, neither does Shaikh Hamad, as the Dowasir appear to be fairly cowed, but the case is the supreme test of Shaikh Hamad's new regime and any hesitation on his part, should there be delay in pay ment, etc., would be fatal, and cause opposition among all other Sunni tribes, un important though they are, compared to the Dowasir. It seems absolutely essen tial, therefore, that should necessity arise, we should support Shaikh Hamad. A gunboat is now here and likely to remain for some time. 1 would suggest that if there is any show of defiance at the meeting to-day, 1 be authorized to ask the Commander to move up and take up a position off Budaiyah. This would have &amp; gieat moral effect. Should theie be still further trouble, it might be necessary after due warning, to undertake a light bombardment of Budaiyah or at any rate fire a few rounds over the town. 1 should be glad, if on receipt of this report, you Would kindly instruct me telegraphically, as to whether, in the event of necessity aiising, I may call on H. M. S, ' Cyclamen ' for the assistance necessary. It would be given at Shaikh Hamad's request, which if necessary, 1 could obtain from him in writing. In any case, befo v e taking any definite action, 1 will refei for final instructions by cleaj line message, should necessity arise. Neithei the Shaikh nor I contemplate serious delay or opposition, particularly if we can move the gunboat near Budaiyah at the slightest sign of trouble, but it would be well to be prepared for any eventuality. Knowing all the circumstances I concur with the action taken and proposed to be taken by Shaikh Hamad. With out taking a strong line now, he will be quite unable to maintain order in the future or to introduce the taxation or other leforms contemplated. 1 should like to add that Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla are co-operating to the best of theii ability and appear genuinely desirous of putting their house in order. They constantly ask my advice on all sorts of matters and accept it as a rule with pleasure. On the other hand they are not devoid of ideas of running their own affairs and 1 think, with a few yeais' support and advice from a Political Agent, should make a strong combination, capable of ruling and of effecting much improve ment in Bahrain.

Appointment of a British Assistant to the Political Agent, Bahrain. 1 have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1683-1466-E., dated the 14tli June 1923, on the subject of the appointment of a British Assistant to the Political Agent, Bahrain. In reply to paragraph 2 of your letter cited above, i venture to clear the ground by stating that I realised from the outset that any nosals i nvo lving an additional charge on Indian revenues would be hopeless at the present juncture and my proposal was that Bahrain revenues should take all receipts from court fees and bear the entire cost of the proposed appointment; further that if, as I hoped would not be the case, any additional expenditure was involved, that 'surplus expenditure should be met from Bahrain Customs revenues. 2 The position of Bahrain is peculiar and at my recent visit there I was greatly t ck bv the increased wealth of the islands. Bahrain pearl merchants from Mana- S T the foreigners' town, now proceed direct to Paris without the intermediary of - ' m iddleman and have, I am informed, establishments in Paris and London tSre thev sell their pearls direct to customers. If the Political Agent's proposals as to survey and settlement go forward, important civil legal questions are bound tn arise and I confidently anticipate from my experience m Iraq that the Bahrai n Foreigners' Court under the Bahrain Order in Council would, in good and capable hands, be very soon entirely self-supporting. q It is at present almost impossible for the Political Agent, worried as he is with cleaning out the Augean stables of the Customs in Bahrain, to give the neces- Trv time that would be involved in preparing an estimate of the amount of judicial revenues that might be expected if court work was taken up properly by an experi- eneed whole -time officer who could devote himself to the proper working of the Bahrain Order in Council. d Owinff to the influx of foreigners which may fairly be presumed to be due 4.

I trust that the disadvantages of my proposal will, on consideration, in view of its comparatively temporary nature, not be found open to such obvious objection ; and that it will be possible to lend to the Bahrain Government the ser vices of a fairly experienced officer of the Political Department with the special qualifications I have pressed for. 7. T enclose a statement which gives a very rough estimate of the proposed addi tional expenditure which the appointment of a Judicial Assistant will involve, at anv rate at the beginning. As the work expands—and revenues increase—it wifl no doubt be necessary for the officer to add to his establishment. It is impossible to make any forecast now of what may be required later on. The statement shows a sum of Rs. 11,000 on^ the revenue side as against an estimated expenditure of Rs 21,360. The figure Rs. 11,000, receipts from judicial stamps, is taken from the Political Agent's latest report on the working of the Order in Council. This source of revenue is capable of much expansion in the future but for the purposes of this preliminary budget it may be accepted. Nothing has been shown as receipts from fines, as I have no information whatever to go upon ; but it is undeniable that some considerable income may be expected under this head. I think it is very probable that the Court, as it expands, will not only become entirely self-supporting but even show considerable profit. On the figures I have given, however, it will be necessary for the Court to draw on the Bahrain Customs Receipts to the extent ^of some Rs. 10,000 in order that receipts may balance expenditure. Such initial expenditure on equipment (books and furniture) as may be re quired will be inconsiderable, and can be met from the office allowance of the Political Agent.

Memorandum No. 207-C.—9-2, dated the 17th December 1923, from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum erom the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 207-0.—9-20, dated Bahrein, the 17 t 3 December 1923 (C oneidential). Your telegram N o . 1163 has just been received by me and by coinci dence I have^ just completed a Budget, which I bad intended to send with my replies to the various points raised in your demi-official letters from Muscat and elsewhere. It is apparent I think from the Go^emment of India wire referred to in your 1163 that they are concerned lest wo should be suggesting reforms which the exchequer cannot bear. I do not think that the Government of India have yet had sufficient information on the finances to realise hov very much more prosperous Bahrein is than other Gulf Arab States. Perhaps I myself contributed somewhat to the belier that Bahrein was an impecunious state, when I wrote a somewhat pessimistic report (in the li^ht of after events) at the time when Colonel Knox suggested the appointment of a Judicial Adviser to Bahrein to be paid for out of the Revenues. At that time I had had not sufficient opportunity to gauge the a^pts of the state. Finances were in the utmost confusion and the customs had not been put in order and I could get no information out of the Hindu Director which I could be ceitain was reliable. 1 or that reason I was most anxious to incur no expenditure before the Customs was m order and I had the benefit of expert advice. We are now, however, in a position to aoeurately gauge both receipts and expenditure and I think that the attached ? f,' (I have omitted the details on which the various items are based but they have been worked out minutely and in consultation with Mr. Bower as regards receipts and expenditure is now all fixed and regularised) shows a very satis- factorv state of affairs and that there need not be any anxiety on the score of finance as regards the cost of reforms proposed the estimates for which are included in ^the Budget with an ample margin in every case, as will be seen from the remarks against each item. The position is that the state has at the moment over three lakhs rupees in hand _ Of this it is proposed to earmark one lakh for improvements to bung the cus oms up to datef by building sheds to protect merchandise on the wharf, complete the customs jetty, lay a narrow f ^ anfl fn hnild a small bouse on a site already available for the Customs Director, jhe actual cost of all these is estimated by Mr. Bower and myself to he about Es. 80,000 but the Sheikh agrees that we should allow 1 lakh to be on the sa e side We then have two lakhs in hand to meet any initial expenditure r levies such as provision of huts, etc., and initial equipment and possibly for the provision or part provision of a water supply, which would he an immense boon to the people of Mammeh. In addition some of the ^'he he carried out and become a cost to the state for some months meanwHHe ttie Reserve will be still further mounting up. XI—708 (s)Apart from tins tlie Budget shows that when and if all the proposed reforms are in full swing we can count on a monthly excess of receipts over expenditure of at least Rs. 20,000 per mensem. say 'at least' because receipts have been purposely estimated most conservative basis, while expendi- ture has been given a considerable margin under each head. The Budget has been prepared for one month instead ot one year, which it is hoped will be equally useful, but receipts are the average monthly receipts based on careful study of the figures of the past three years. The somewhat astonishins; imprOTe- ment is of course due to an immense amount tf sheer waste, largely within the customs itself, which it has been possible to curtail. No allowance has been made for the increase of receipts which would result if the increase of customs prices be sanctioned, but this increase would amount (estimated by Mr. Bower) to about Rs. 16,500 a month. The estimate of Rs. 4,000 under miscellaneous headings, on the receipts side, is a very conservative one. Court fees alone, in the Bahrein Court, have recently been amounting to about Rs. 1,000 a month. Letter from the Hon'ble Lietjtenant-Coloxel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C .I.E., Political President in the Persian Gulp, No . 5f&gt;S., dated Btjshire, the 17th (received 30th) January 1924. Sunni and Shiah troubles in ^Bahrein. In continuation of the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 90, dated 15th January 1924, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the following report regarding the outrage committed against the village of Wadiyan in Sitrah on the night of the 7th-8th January. 2. It appears that during the night of the 7th-8th January a number of armed men, some of whom have been recognised as coming from Rifa, sur rounded the village of Wadiyan in Sitrali and opened fire on it. As a result (as already reported in my telegram No. 51, dated 10th January) one man and one woman were killed and five persons, including one woman, wounded. Rifa is a large village about 15 miles inland from Manameh on the main island which has for years been the residence of Sheikh KhaUd, the brother of Sheikh Isa, and his sons, and is completely dominated by him. I have not yet got the evidence, such as it is, about the actual perpetrators of the crime, but one can start off by assuming without hesitation that no inhabitants of Rifa would dare to do such a thing without the knowledge and consent of Sheikh Khalid and Sheikh Ibrahim, his son; in fact there is a strong presumption that the outrage was committed by the orders of one or other or perhaps both. 3. The outrage was arranged to take place after Sheikh Hamad had gone on a shooting expedition to the Persian Coast near Lingah, and was probably committed with a view to getting him into difficulties and possibly trouble with Government, as well as with the object of taking revenge on those inhabi tants of Sitrah, or on the people there generally, who dared to complain and give evidence about the previous outrage —complaints which resulted in the banishment of Sheikh Ali bin Khalid to India and of one of his brothers to the mainland. 4. Sheikh Hamad had only left Bahrein on the evening of the 5th and had just arrived at Lingah when the news of the outrage reached Mohammed, who was acting for him, and the Political Agent. The former immediately wired to Sheikh Hamad asking him to come back, and the Political Agent telegraphed to me reporting the affair and asking me to telegraph, to Sheikh Hamad and request him to return. This I did and he promptly did return by the first subsidiary steamer calling at Lingah, arriving at Bahrein on the 14th instant. On arrival Sheikh Hamad appears to have called on the Political Agent, and as soon as he entered the Agency the house was apparently surrounded by hundreds of Baharnah wanting to complain to him. The petitioners appeared to ha^ e become somewhat clamorous and something of a demonstration apparently occurred, as a result of which Sheikh Hamad produced a letter, whichJ presumably had been prepcred beforehand, and having read it out to the crowd, handed it to Major Daly. Ihe gist of this letter (as reported in my telegram No. 88, dated 15th January) is that Sheikh Hamad is prepared to take whatever action he is directed to do by Government but is unable to do anything without such orders. In this connection I forward herewith a copy of a telegram from the Bahreini community dated 15th instant reporting this incident and imploring the assistance of Government. 5. Previous to the arrival of Sheikh Hamad certain members of the Baharnah community had presented a petition to Major Daly on the 13th instant asking him to forward to me a copy of a monster petition signed and sealed by hundreds of Bahrein Shiahs. These were duly forwarded to me and a copy of each of them is annexed, for the information of Government. 6. Prior to the receipt of these petitions two Bahrein Shiah subjects came over to Bushire by the mail steamer which brought Siieikh Hamad from Lingah, bringing a petition to me (copy annexed) They asked for an interview and a reply which they c^uld take back to the Bahrein Shiah community. I interviewed them on Saturday the 12th instant, and yesterday gave them a reply to their petition, a copy of which is annexed for inform ation, and I told the petitioners very much what I have said in my written reply, viz., that Borne was not built in a day, in other words. But time is eoinc on now and six months have elapsed since we started to introduce the reforms, and it is certain that if the Khalifah family can organize such out rages more or less with impunity, the reforms will be a farce. 7. T enclose, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of Maior Daly's letter, No. 13-C., dated 15th January, reporting the incident. It will be seen from this and from the petition of the Bahrein fehiah com munity that the punishment meted out for the last Sitrah outrage was not sufficient. The banishment of Sheikh Selman bin Khalid to Katar is a farce, while Sheikh Ali who was sent to Bombay at the expense of the Bahrein Government is really now more comfortable than be has been iu his i e. It seems necessary therefore if it is found that Sheikh Khalid or his son Ibrahim instigated or abetted this crime to punish them more severely: banish ment or deportation on more stringent terms seems called for, perhaps bams ment with a term of imprisonment to start with, 8. As I have already suggested in my telegram.

In conclusion, I may observe again that the Bahrein Shiah commu- nity after years of oppression are absolutely incapable 01 doing anything for themselves and can only petition us and whme. It they had banded together and resisted the oppression of the Khalifah family I think they could have done a great deal long ago. Even when they made a few demonstrations a couple of years ago Sheikh Isa became quite alarmed and nas quite prepared to make some concessions. This bein 0 ' the case, our task in Bahrein of bolstering up a ruling family, which cannot' rule justly or efficiently, and of helping at the same time a community which cannot help themselves is an extremely thankless one. Telegram from ihe Bahreini Community, Bahrein, to the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, dated the 15th January 1924 Sheikh Hamad read to us a letter written to Political Agent that he can do nothing.

Never theless we are not hopeless of obtaining your mercy and the mercy of the High Government. Though the Baharneh of these Islands number not less than one hundred and sixty thousand persons, yet should only ten of these remain we will not cease to claim our rights against those who have murdered our compatriots without their having committed any offence. The eyes of the community are set upon the High Government, waiting for her compassion. In order to complete our supplication we send herewith a petition explain ing the outrages Vi hich have occurred and the dreadful crimes of the past and present. In conclusion, we beg Your Excellency to send it to the Honble Colonel Trevor at Bushire, quickly, that he may send it to the Government o His Majesty the King and send us a dt finite answer and issue the necessary orders to ensure our protection and to remove oppression and obtain for ns redress from the oppressors, as we have stated in our petitions.

After Greetings suitable to your high Estate, we beg to inform Your Excellency, with regard to our petition presented by our representatiyes, Haji Mehdi bin Saif and Mullah Hassan ibn Shaik, dated 1st Jamad al Thani 1342, concerning the outrage which has occurred in Sitrah and the murders of people there, both men and women. It is not concealed from Your Excellency, the previous outrage at 'Ali and the deaths which resulted. Shortly after a further outrage occurred at ^itrah which was committed by the sons of lihalid ipatir; Ali 'Al Khalifeh. We informed you of that and Your Excellency did not attksjE;; f a ii and came to Bahrein and gave us assurances of peace and safety 0 The M\\m c 0lir t caused those concerned to be brought before it, and after trial, their guilt was proved. We were awaiting the sentence of the Court upon the guilty, when two persons were deported to India and two to Qatar. Your Excellency doubtless knows that there is a distance of only^ a few hours TO mil between Bahrein and Qatar. Those who were sent to Bombay live in luxury mlW and with financial aid from th(J Bahrein Government, which they en^oy and they are well housed. If this is to be the punishment of murderers, all the criminals will continue their crimes and be happy and obliged with sucn treatment. iiiicllf! i We informed Your Excellency before that we were prepared to send re presentatives to London to Bis Majesty the King, Sultan and Emperor of the British Empire, to obtain orders for security in our land. Your Excellency did not fail, and came to us and verbally promised us security. We were Miki grateful to you and gave up the idea of sending our representatives. But r alas 1 In spite of Your Excellency's orders and the orders of the High Govern- ^ ment, Khalid and his sons have again returned to their evil deeds and have Ex# committed these crimes in spite of the Great Government. All theettorts ot the Bite the High Government have been to protect the Rulers of Bahrein and they have tow? retained their Goyernment, but their subjects have been neglected If God sed'kl^ forbid 1 the Great Goyernment is to fail to protect the subjects, let it be k ri0WI J jeering to us so that we may have resort to some other Government, such as that of our ids ® ' Persia or its like. . idtlietf If the Great Goyernment intends to protect the people and maintain order in the land we beg firstly, for soldiers and protectors to be A- villages of Bahrein to give security and prevent the oppiession ot their ml a tants, And that also is useless, except Khalid and his sons be deported an punished openly and with severity, so that others like them may take warning. ^ In conclusion, we beg that Your Excellency will forward this, ^r petition, to His Maiesty the King, before the evil-doers commit further crimes in the land. ;• Haste !

After compliments. —I have received your short petition, dated 1st Jamadi II and also your long petition, dated 5th idem, with several hundred signatures. I was exceedingly sorry to hear from the Political Agent on 2nd Jamadi II (9th January) of this second outrage at Sitrah and imme diately reported the whole case to the High Government by telegram, and asked the Captain of a man-of-war to proceed to Bahrein, and I tried to proceed there myself hut was not able to do so as no ship was available at the moment. I am now awaiting the orders of the High Government. I agree that the outrage is a very serious one and hope that it may be possible for the Sheikh to appreiiend and punish the offenders, and assure you that any assistance I can give to His Excellency towards doing so will be gladly accorded. As 1^informed your representatives the tyrannies of generations cannot be removed in a lew weeks without extraordinary drastic remedies which it is not feasible to apply. It is only step by step that good government can be intro duced.Qi Since I came back from leave in October I have made proposals for a force of levies or Military Police to be established at Bahrein on the same lines as has bpen established at Muscat and I hope something of the sort will be approved. Eut a force of this sort even if sanctioned cannot be improvised in a day. Therefore I recommend you to possess your souls in patience in the hope that matters will be improved before long, and to refrain from writing petitions in the strain of the last part of your petition of the 5th Jamadi which is calculated to alienate the sympathies of your well wishers and antagonize others. Letter from Major C. K. Daly, Political Agent, Bahrein, to Lietjtbnant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Hesident in the Persian Gulf, No. 13-0., dated the 13th January 1924 (Confi dential). Outrage in Sitrah. I have the honour to forward a petition presented to me by representa tives of the Baharneh Community who desired me to forward it to you. Durino' the past nine months five armed attacks by Sunms on Shiahs have occurred resulting in about twelve deaths and a ^mberofsenous iniuries. This does not include the deaths during the Manameh not in May last. You will remember that for the attack on 'Ali the Sheikh inflicted a light monetary fine on the leader of the Uowasir, who was responsible. Shortlv after an 'Alim and another person were murdered Por this crime nobody was apprehended, although it is heyond doubt that the Dowasir were the offenders. . , , . As a result of the previous attack on Sitrah, the Sheikh, much against his symjrathles^ sentenced one son of Sheikh Khalid to deportation for life, and another for deportation for one year to the mainland. _ . It is evident that such light punishment for so serious a crime has encouraged the perpetration of this further outrage. . The first deportee is detained in India at the expense ot the Bahrein Government, and is probably in greater C0 ™ f ° rt ^ n P^ e 10 ^ S ai Xnd which is The other went, with some foUo^ors. to * plac^on ^^y ^ ^ ^ within four hours of Bahrein, 0 w t0 have escaped all punish- hawking expeditions, lie may b « ^ the 4 en t outrage. ment.

They are also of his position curtail the constant oppression o had ^e courage to assert himself, all such are very apparent, still, I think, if he oth g r ^d, the difficulties of opposition would quickly to ^ us tify our countenancing continued Hamad's position does not seem to Hi s difficulties are largely the result of inability to deal justly with bis Majesty's 'Government, his endeavours to carry out the reforms des ^ y gaine timei any which he is without doubt endeavouring to ao. «i i8 sclieme of reforms aimGd at the improveniGnt of tho status of thG oppressed Shialis of Bahrein, is rendered perfectly useless as long as their lives are in constant jeopardy. Of what avail is Hamad's Court, in which for the first time Bahreinis have an opportunity of obtaining redress, if after decisions therein, the witnesses can he murdered with impunity ? Sheikh Muhammad, who has been acting for Hamad in the latter's absence, has been unable to induce any of the accused to surrender themselves, and has no means of enforcing any orders, had he the desire to do so, which is certainly not the case. They have sent him messages to the effect that they are willing to appear before the Shara' Court, but inasmuch as no member of A1 Khalifah has ever been condemned before that court, although several have nominally been tried the reason for this is obvious, although they present the matter in the guise of religious scruple. Yesterday the Chief Qadhi called on me and expressed his abhorrence of the outrage, and said he had no doubt that Sheikh KhaUd's sons and tbeir followers were guilty. I endeavoured, therefore, to ascertain how he would be likely to dispose of the case if it went before him. He proceeded to give a number of ingenious reasons why it would probably be impossible for him to give an effective decision. He stated without hesitation that this was a Political crime, the punish ment for which should be dealt out by the Ruler, or failing him. His Majesty's Government. He added ' Great Britain has protected these Islands for 96 years. She placed Sheikh Isa and his descendants in power on condition that they should rule with justice. They have failed to do so and your Gov ernment has neglected the matter. The policy of your Government is beyond my understanding in these matters. She is responsible for the maintenance of order in Bahrein, Ho they fear Mustafa Kemal Pasha, that they do not force order ? What more obvious reasons can they need than these outrages. Bahrein needs direct rule by a strong Government until a Ruler can be taught how to govern. I told all this to Sir Percy Cox many years ago '. How far the Qadhi is sincere in his statements one cannot say, but he is without doubt the most experienced and educated man in Bahrein. Several deputations of Baharneh have called at the Agency. They all state that His Majesty's Government is pledged to remove gross oppression. They quoted replies to questions in the petitions as assurances of adequate protection. They are deriving considerable support from the Persian Shiah community, with whom the Haharneh are much inter-married. The Persians are making political capital out of our alleged connivance at the murders of Shiahs. and there are rumours that alarmist reports have been sent to Teheran to this effect. Doubtless, there will be the usual crop of anti-British articles in the Persian Press.

Memorandum No. 207-C.—9-2, dated the 17th December 1923, from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 207-0.—9-20, dated Bahrein, the 17 t 3; December 1923 ( Confidential). Your telegram No. 1163 has just been received by me and by coinci dence I have just completed a Budget, which I bad intended to send with my replies to the various points raised in your demi-official letters from Muscat and elsewhere. It is apparent I think from the GoTernment of India wire referred to in your 1163 that they are concerned lest we should be suggesting reforms which the exchequer cannot bear. I do not think that the Government of India have yet had sufficient information on the finances to realise ho.v very much more prosperous Bahrein is than other Gulf i\rab States. Perhaps I myself contributed somewhat to the belief that Bahrein was an impecunious state, when I wrote a somewhat pessimistic report (in the light of after events) at the time when Colonel Knox suggested the appointment of a Judicial Adviser to Bahrein to be paid for out of the Revenues. At that time I had had not sufficient opportunity to gauge the assets of the state. Finances were in the utmost confusion and the customs bad not been put in order and I could get no information out of the Hindu Director which I could be certain was reliable. For that reason I was most to incur no expenditure before the Customs w r as in order and I had the benefit of expert advice. We are now, however, in a position to accurately aauge both receipts and expenditure and I think that the attached Budget (I have omitted the details on which the various items are based but they have been worked out minutely and in consultation with ]VIr. Bower as regards receipts and expenditure is now all fixed and regularised) shows a very satis factory state of affairs and that there need not be any anxiety on the score of finance as regards the cost of reforms proposed the estimates for which are included in the Budget with an ample margin in every case, as will be seen from the remarks against each item. The position is that the state has at the moment over three lakhs rupees in hand ' Of this it is proposed to earmark one lakh for improvements to bring the customs up to date, by building sheds to protect merchandise on the wharf, complete the customs jetty, lay a narrow gauge track for moving merchandise, and to build a small bouse on a site already available for the Customs Director. The actual cost of all these is estimated by Mr. Bower and myself to be about Rs 80 000 but the Sheikh agrees that we should allow 1 lakh to be on the sate side We then have two lakhs in hand to meet any initial expenditure for levies, such as provision of huts, etc., and initial equipment and possibly tor the provision or part provision of a water supply, which would be an immense boon to the people of Manameh. In addition some of the reforms proposed wilJ not be carried out and become a cost to the state for some months meanwhile the Reserve will be still further mounting up. xi— 708 (s)Apart from this the Budget shows that when and if all the proposed reforms are in full swing we can count on a monthly excess of receipts over expenditure of at least Es. 20,000 per mensem 1^ say ' at least' because receipts have been purposely estimated most conservative basis, while expendi- tare has been given a considerable margin under each head. The Budget has been prepared for one month instead of one year, which it is hoped will be equally useful, but receipts are the average monthly receipts based on careful study of the figures of the past three years. The somewhat astonishing improve ment is of course due to an immense amount of sheer 'waste, largely within the customs itself, which it has been possible to curtail. No allowance has been made for the increase of receipts which would result if the increase of customs prices be sanctioned, but this increase would amount (estimated by Mr. Bower) to about Rs 16,500 a month. The estimate of Rs. 4,000 under miscellaneous headings, on the receipts side, is a very conservative one. Court fees alone, in the Bahrein Court, have recently been amounting to about lis. 1,000 a month. Letter from the Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulp, No. 56-S., dated Bushire, the 17th (received 30th) January 1924. Sunni and Shiah troubles in Bahrein. In continuation of the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 90, dated 15th January 1924, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the following report regarding the outrage committed against the village of Wadiyan in Sitrah on the night of the 7th-8th January. 2. It appears that during the night of the 7th-8th January a number of armed men, some of whom have been recognised as coming from Rifa, sur rounded the village of Wadiyan in Sitrah and opened fire on it. As a result (as already reported in my telegram No. 51, dated 10th January) one man and one woman were killed and five persons, including one woman, wounded. Rifa is a large village about 15 miles inland from Manameh on the main island which has for years been the residence of Sheikh Khalid, the brother of Sheikh Isa, and his sons, and is completely dominated by him. I have not yet got the evidence, such as it is, about the actual perpetrators of the crime, but one can start off by assuming without hesitation that no inhabitants of Rifa would dare to do such a thing without the knowledge and consent of Sheikh Khalid and Sheikh Ibrahim, his son; in fact there is a strong presumption that the outrage was committed by the orders of one or other or perhaps both. 3. The outrage was arranged to take place after Sheikh Hamad had gone on a shooting expedition to the Persian Coast near Lingah, and was probably committed with a view to getting him into difficulties and possibly trouble with Government, as well as with the object of taking revenge on those inhabi tants of Sitrah, or on the people there generally, who dared to complain and give evidence about the previous outrage— complaints which resulted in the banishment of Sheikh Ali bin Khalid to India and of one of his brothers to the mainland. 4. Sheikh Hamad had only left Bahrein on the evening of the 5th and had just arrived at Lingah when the news of the outrage reached Mohammed, who was acting for him, and the Political Agent. The former immediately wired to Sheikh Hamad asking him to come back, and the Political Agent telegraphed to me reporting the affair and asking me to telegraph to Sheikh Hamad and request him to return. This I did and he promptly did return by the first subsidiary steamer calling at Lingah, arriving at Bahrein on the 14th instant. On arrival Sheikh Hamad appears to have called on the Political Agent, aod as soon as he entered the Agency the house was apparently surrounded hy hundreds of Baharnah wanting to complain to him. The petitioners appeared to have become somewhat clamorous and something of a demonstration apparently occurred, as a result of which Sheikh Hamad produced a letter, which^ if. f presumably had been prepared beforebacd, and baviog read it out to the crowd, handed it to Major Daly. Ihe gist of this letter (as reported in my telegram No. 88, dated l&amp;th January) is that Sheikh . Hamad is prepared to take whatever action he is directed to do by Government but is unable to do anything without such orders. In this connection I forward herewith a copy of a telegram from the Bahreini community dated 15th instant reporting this incident and imploring the assistance of Government. 5. Previous to the arrival of Sheikh Hamad cerfain members of the Baharnah community had presented a petition to Major Daly on the 13th instant asking him to forward to me a copy of a monster petition signed and sealed by hundreds of Bahrein Shiahs. These were duly forwarded to me and a copy of each of them is annexed, for the information of Government. 6. Prior to the receipt of these petitions two Bahrein Shiah subjects came over to Bushire by the mail steamer which brought Sheikh Hamad from Lingah, bringing a petition to me (copy annexed) Ta y asked for an interview and a reply which they cmld take back to the Bahrein Shiah community. I interviewed them on Saturday the 12th instant, and yesterday gave them a reply to their petition, a copy of which is annexed for inform ation, and I told the petitioners very much what I have said in my written reply, viz., that Rome was not built in a day, in other words. But time is going on now and six months have elapsed since we started to introduce the reforms, and it is certain that if the Khalifah family can organize such out rages moie or less with impunity, the reforms will be a farce. 7. I enclose, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of Major Daly's letter, No. 13-C., dated 15th January, reporting the incident. It will be seen from this and from the petition of the Bahrein Shiah com munity that the punishment meted out for the last Sitrah outrage was not sufficient. The banishment of Sheikh Selman bin Ivhalid to Ivatar is a farce, while Sheikh Ali who was sent to Bombay at the expense of the Bahrein Government is really now more comfortable than he has been in his^ life. It seems necessary therefore if it is found that Sheikh Khalid or his son Ibrahim instigated or abetted this crime to punish them more severely: banish ment or deportation on more stringent terms seems called for, perhaps bamsn- ment with a term of imprisonment to start with, 8. x^s I have already suggested in my telegram, No. 51, dated 10th Januarv, 1 think the institution of the Levy Corps at Bahrein should be expedited and that if tlie Muscat Government agrees, as many men as can be spared should b« lent to the Bahreia Government pending the raising of the men for the Bahrein Corps by the Commandant of the Muscat .Levy , Corps. 9. I consider that if men are available and are sent to Bahrein, as soon as they have settled down a detachment should be sent to Sitia to pro ec the place and its cost recovered from the emoluments and revenue of Sheik Khalid and Sheikh Ibrahim. Other detachments couk y.^ er , suitable places to protect Shiahs from these outrages, and if a detachment has to be placed at any place as the resull of an outrage the cost ot su ; detachmeut should be met (at least as lar as possible) from the ' members of the Khalifah family or Headman of tlie 'L.wfr l that instigated the outrage, or if it was committed by a Sunm village, from that village. 10. It will be seen from the correspondence ^as^already reported m my telegram, my telegram, ^o. yu, a ^ cec \ / 0 f the whole Khalifah incapable of taking action in the face of the pp bein^' but I family. He may feel rather stronger when ihe ^ doubt if he will really be over strong enough to do much bes t d feels with all the Khalifah family that the Baharnah are there to be outrag^ and fleeced and oppressed, and is really not m sympathy w y improving their position. 11.

Even when they made a few demonstrations a couple of years ago Sbeikh Isa became (^uite alanned and ^uas (^uite piepared to make some concessions.

After Greetings suitable to your high Estate, we beg to inform Your Excellency, with regard to our petition presented by our representatives, Haji Mehdi bin Saif and Mullah Hassan ibn Shaik, dated 1st Jamad al Thani 1342, concerning the outrage which has occurred in Sitrah and the murders of people there, both men and women. It is not concealed, from Your Excellency, the previous outrage at 'Ali and the deaths -which resulted. Shortly after a further outrage occurred at Sitrah which was committed by the sons of Khalid bin Ali 'Al Khalifeh. We informed you of that and Your Excellency did not fail and came to Bahrein and gave us assurances of peace and safety. The Court caused those concerned to be brought before it, and after trial, their guilt was proved. We were awaiting the sentence of the Court upon the guilty, when two persons were deported to India and two to Qatar. Your Excellency doubtless knows that there is a distance of only ^ a few hours between Bahrein and Qatar. Those who w T ere sent to Bombay live in luxury and with financial aid from the Bahrein Government, which they enjoy and they are well housed. If this is to be the punishment of murdeiers, ^ all the criminals will continue their crimes and be happy and obliged with such treatment. We informed Your Excellency before that we were prepared to send re presentatives to London to His Majesty the King, Sultan and Emperor of the British Empire, to obtain orders for security m our land. Your Excellency did not fail, and came to us and verbally promised us security. We w_ere grateful to you and gave up the idea of sending our representatives. But alas 1 In spite of Your Excellency's orders and the orders of the High Govern ment, Khali 'd and his sons have again returned to their evil deeds and have committed these crimes in spite of the Great Government. All the e 13 the High Government have been to protect the Rulers of Bahrein and they have retained their Government, but their subjects have been neglected If God forbid ! the Great Government is to fail to protect the subjects, let it be known to us so that we may have resort to some other Government, such as that Persia or its like. . If the Great Government intends to protect the people and maintain order in the land we beg firstly, for soldiers and protectors to be brought te all the villages of Bahrein to give securitv and prevent the oppression ot their in a - tents And that also is useless, eicept Khalid and his sons be deported and punished openly and with.severity, so that others like them may take warning. In conclusion, we beg that Your Excellency will forward this, our petition, tn TTk Maiestv the King before the evil-doers commit further crimes in the land. and be s'o' good as to reply to us and to issue definite orders, for it is not possible for us to remain in the land in this condition. 5th Jamadi al Thani 1342. _ p t &gt; i, • Signed by persons of the Sbiah Community of Bahrein.

But it did not last long and on Tuesday night 1st Jamadi II, 13 i2 (=8-1-1924), a party of A1 Khalifah attacked the village cf Sitrah, killed three men and wounded two who are in danger. We informed the Political Agent and asked for a Doctor to inspect the murdered and wounded men. As the mail steamer was present and we were in hurry to bring this incident to Your Honour's notice we despatched our petition to Your Honour through our representatives. In conclusion, we inform you that we are all in narrow circumstances and in danger and have no shelter except God and the justice of the High Government. We beg you to support us quickly. We hope to present a petition to you in detail by post. MOHSIN BEN ABBOLLAH BEN EAJAB. SAIYED MOHAMAD ALBALADI. ABDOE BASUL BEN RAJAB. ABDOL A LI BEN EAJAB. ABDUL A LI BEN RAJAB.

After compliments.—1 have received your short petition, dated 1st Jamadi II ana also your long petition, dated 5th idem, with several hundred signatures. I was exceedingly sorry to hear from the Political Agent on 2nd Jamadi II (9(h January) of this second outrage at Sitrah and imIn6• diately reported the whole case to the High Government by telegram, and asked the Captain of a man-of-war to proceed to Bahrein, and I tried to pioceed there myself but vvas not able to do so as no ship was available at the moment. I am now awaiting the orders of the High Government. 1 agree that the outrage is a very serious one and hope that it may be possible for the Sheikh to appreiiend and punish the offenders, and assure you that any assistance I can give to His Excellency towards doing so will be gladly accorded. As I infouned your representatives the tyrannies of generations cannot be removed in a few weeks without extraordinary drastic remedies which it is not feasible to apply. It is only step by step that good government can he intro*Since I came back from leave in October I have made proposals for a force of levies or Military Police to be established at Bahrein on the same lines as has been established at Muscat and I hope something of the sort will be approved. But a force of this sort even if sanctioned cannot be improvised in a day. Therefore I recommend you to possess your souls in patience in the hope that matters will be improved before long, and to refrain from writing petitions in the strain of the last part of your petition of the 5th Jamadi which is calculated to alienate the sympathies of your well wishers and antagonize others.

I have the honour to forward a petition presented to me by representa tives of the Baharneh Community who desired me to forward it to you. During the past nine months five armed attacks by Sunnis on Shiahs have occurred resulting in about twelve deaths and a number of serious injuries. This does not include the deaths during the Manameh riot in May last. You will remember that for the attack on 'All the Sheikh inflicted a light monetary fine on the leader of the Dowasir, who was responsible. Shortly after an 'Alim and another person were murdered. For this crime nobody was apprehended, although it is beyond doubt that the Dowasir were the offenders. As a result of the previous attack on Sitrah, the Sheikh, much against his sympathies, sentenced one son of Sheikh Klialid to oepoitation for life, and another for deportation for one year to the mainland. It is evident that such light punishment for so serious a crime has encouraged the perpetration of this further outrage. The first deportee is detained in India at the expense of the Bahrein Government, and is probably in greater comfort than previous to t.. c crime. The other went, with some followers, to a place on the mainland which is within four hours of Bahrein, to which it nas been customary to go for hawking expeditions. He may be said, therefore, to have escaped all punish- ment. From this place he returned and took part in the recent outiage. Sheikh Khalid and his son Ibrahim have been importuning Sheikh Hamad and myself for some time past, for the return fro™ , m . 0 , 18 so 1 n ' , 1® &lt;■ , knows he was sentenced to deportation for life and has been absent only months. „ ^ . .„ . Sheikh Hamad is due back from Lingah to-day.. I fear thai he will not take any action in the present matter which . ill have the desircdjffect of putting a stop to these outrages. He is fully aware o. that if he so, but I am convinced f . ea ^^ L woufd start a btdTeud^^ - - fact by no means improbable, although I think^t highly mwSL eupttil the SSe'iounje t „ a»..t UiraeK, .11 .och Hamad's position does not seem to me are largely the result of inability to deal justly wlt , h .? ls desired by His Majesty's Government, his endeavours to carry out the retoims aes ^ J time, any which he is without doubt endeavouring to do. At the same time. y8 sclieme of reforms aimed at the improvement of the status of the oppressed Shiahs of Bahrein, is rendered perfectly useless as long as their lives are in constant jeopardy. Of what avail is Hamad s Court, in which for the first time Bahreinis have an opportunity of obtaining redress, if after decisions therein, the witnesses can be murdered with impunity . Sheikh Muhammad, who has been acting for Hamad m the latter's absence, has been unable to induce any of the accused to surrender themselves,, and has no means of enforcing any orders, had he the desire to do so which is certainIv not the case. They have sent him messages to the eifect that they are willing to appear before the Shara' Court, but inasmuch as no member of M Khalifah has ever been condemned before that court, although several have nominally been ' tried the reason for this is obvious, although they present the matter in the guise of religious scruple. Yesterday the Chief Qadhi called on mo and expressed his abhorrence of the outrage, and said he had no doubt that Sheikh Khahd's sons and their followers were guilty. I endeavoured, therefore, to ascertain how he would be likely to dispose of the case it it went before him. He proceeded to give a cumber of ingenious reasons why it would probably be impossible for him to give an effective decision. He stated without hesitation that this was a Political crime, the punish ment for which should be dealt out by the Ruler, or failing him. His Majesty s Government. He added ' Great Britain has protected these Islands for 96 years. She placed Sheikh Isa and his descendants in power on condition that they should rule with justice. They have failed to do so and your Gov ernment has neglected the matter. The policy of your Government is beyond my understanding in these matters. She is responsible for the maintenance cf order in Bahrein. Ho they fear Mustafa Kemal Pasha, that they do not force order ? What more obvious reasons can they need than these outrages. Bahrein needs direct rule by a strong Government until a Ruler ^can be taught how to govern. I told all this to Sir Percy Cox many years ago '. How far the Qadhi is sincere in his statements one cannot say, but he is without doubt the most experienced and educated man in Bahrein. Several deputations of Baharneh have called at the Agency. They all state that His Majesty's Government is pledged to remove gross oppression. They quoted replies to questions in the petitions as assurances of adequate protection. They are deriving considerable support from the Persian Shiah community, with whom the Baharneh are much inter-married. The Persians are making political capital out of our alleged connivance at the murders of Shiahs. and there are rumours that alarmist reports have been sent to Teheran to this effect. Doubtless, there will be the usual crop of anti-British articles in the Persian Press. GCP, Delhi—XI—708 (S)-12-2.24—7.1 L etteb prom the H on'ble L ieutenant- C olonel A, P.

S ubject.— Sunni and Shiah troubles in Bahrein. In continuation and in amplification of my telegram No. 166, dated 30th January 1924, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the following report, on the recent outrage by Sunni tribesmen, at the instigation of members of the A1 Khalifa family, against the Sbiah Baharnah population at Sitrah. 2. In my letter No. 56-S., dated 17th January, I reported the matter up to the time when Sheikh Hani ad returned to Bahrein, declared he would do whatever Government ordered, and arrested three or four men who were not the ringleaders in the outrage. As mentioned in my telegram No. 88, dated 15th January, I had been waiting tor an opportunity to go to Bahrein since the 13th January, but for various reasons connected in the main with the lighting and buoying arrangements which it is unnecessary to detail, the ' Lawrence' was not available. However, directly after the receipt of Government of India telegram, No. 195, dated 21st January, I telegraphed to the Comnrander of H. M. S. Crocus', the only one of His Majesty's ships in the Gulf at the moment, and he kindly consented to take me over. 3. I arrived at Bahrein about midday of the 2nth January, and I landed and went to the Agency to devise some arrangement by which Sheikh Hamad, who was naturally very nervous cf running contrary to the views of the entire Khalifa family, could be brought up to the scratch. This was duly arranged and it was decided to call Sheikh Hamad, who had gone to his country house at Saghair, to visit me at the Agency at 10 a. m . on 26th January and bring his uncle, Sheikh Khalid, who was living at Eifa, a few miles from Saghair, with him. This was done. 4. The next morning the news of my arrival having been noised abroad among the Baharnah, the latter began dropping into the Agency by twos and threes from an early hour. By 9 o'clock the whole place, inner courtyard inside the house, compound and every available open space within sight was swarming with Baharnah who all started shouting ' Justice and othei words to the same effect—ehoutiHg perhaps is too strong a word : groaning or moaning the words misht be more suitable. Sheikh Hamad^ did not arrive till about 11 owing partly to difficulty in getting Sheikh Khalid to come and partly to tbe bad state of the road due to extraordinarily heavy rams which have fallen this cold weather over the North-Western end of the Gulf ino groaning and moaning of the Baharnah went on continuously ti S ei Hamad's arrival and at very frequent intervals after until nearly 2 o clock, after Sheikh Hamad's departure, when the Baharnah were with difficulty persuaded to leave the Agency. They had evidently decided to bave a day out and most of the shops were closed while the demonstration was going on. it may be mentioned here that the result of the support which we have given to the Baharnah during the past two or three years and nl f he rod '® tl ™ ^ reforms, was very apparent in this demonstration. The Babarnah would no more have dared to do such a thing a few years ago than fly over the moon. 5. Sbeikh Hamad, as mentioned above, arrived about 11 and the Political Affent and I had a lengthy interview with him; in which by stating that I had been sent speciallyV Government to go into the ^air and assuming a mvsterious air on the subject of the intentions of Government in regard to the case we were able to thoroughly frighten Sheikh Ha™ad .vho^agreed that he would try the men he had arrested and Sj 80 . f ^pvpre and deterrent absconded in absentia, and if he found them gui y in 1C ^ Sheikh punishments. In regard to Sheikh Ibrahim and the o her son ot Sheikh Khalid, he agreed to inflict a very severe punishment^ hichexc^ confiscation of their property and the resumption of their allowances ^ould benominal as he could not get hold of them) and offer a reward for _ their appre- hension. This we thought would meet the case as it would effectively prevent them from returning to Bahrein which was our principal object. Sheikh Hamad also agreed that Sheikh Muhammad bin Isa, who had been carrying on the administration during his absence, had behaved very badly, and said he would reprimand him very severely and tell him that if he did not play up to the reformed Government he would lose his allowances. 6. After the interview with Sheikh Hamad was over, Sheikh Khalid was called in. He is a very old man and was already very alarmed thinking he might be arrested and deported forthwith. He at once agreed to come and live in Muharraq- having been given the choice of living there or in Manama— on a reduced allowance, and declared he would discourage his sons and followers from such acts in future. As there are still a good number of bad characters in Eifa, Sheikh Hamad agreed to send out some one he could trust to the place to keep them in order. 7. After my return I received a telegram from the Political Agent saying that the trial had passed off successfully, and subsequently a letter, No. 32-C., dated 29th January, a copy of which is annexed, reporting the result of the trial. It will be seen from this that Sheikh Hamad sentenced Sheikh Ibrahim and certain others who had absconded to the death penalty and confiscated their property which is to be used to pay double blood-money to the relatives of the murdered people, and offered a reward of Es. 20,000 for their apprehension. He further sentenced various persons to varying terms of imprisonment from 10 years to 6 months. In doing this Sheikh Hamad has acted up to the promises to me and punished the offenders in an examplary manner which will, I hope, have a deterrent effect and tend to prevent future outrages of the sort. I think Sheikh Hamad deserves commendation for this, as he is acting directly contrary to the traditions of his family and to the views of its living members.

There may be some truth in this as one of Mulla Zindiq's sons appeared at the trial and gave evidence for the defence, which was palpably false. They are of course Sunnis.

S ubject.— Sunni and Shiah troubles in Bahrein* In continuation of my letter No. 89-S., dated 2nd February 1924, on the subject of the Sitrah outrage, I have the honour to forward herewith the list of punishments awarded by Sheikh Hamad which was inadvertently omitted by the Political Agent in his memorandum 32-C., owing probably to the necessity of haste in order to catch the mail. 2. Major Daly now reports;— ' The names of the persons sentenced are as follows:— (1) To suffer death penalty, if caught, and confiscation of all property in Bahrein— Selman bin Khalid, Ibrahim bin Khalid. Abdur Kazzak. Nasir bin Ahmad. Selman bin Mudhi, Ahmad Euwaihi. Of the above, Selman bin Khalid and^Abdur Eazzak were already under sentence of one year's banishment, when they returne and committed this crime. (2) Salim bin Ambar (personal servant of Selman bin Khalid), 10 years. (3) Ibrahim bu Mubarak bu Khammas, 8 years. (4.) Habib Hasawi, Hussain Hasawi, Abu Humaideh, each 3 years. (5) Jasim bin Abdulla Daghath, 2 years. ^ . (6) Khalifeh Abu Shahab, Abdulla bin ^ Muhammad bm ShahiD, Marzook bin Khamis, each 6 months 3. Major Daly was present during the trial as some of ' h ® Nejdis and Hassawis. He says that the trial was conducted by Sheikh Ham^ very properly and the evidence against the accused was v y . .u himself kept a memorandum of the statements of witnesses, n sentences passed just and reasonable and in accordance wi aw. 1 The Political Agent adds ! « In connection with the above outrage Sheikh Hamad informed me yesterday that he had been fiion that the whole affair had been got up by Sheikh4 among A1 Khalifeh and that undoubtedly Abdulla had known that it would occur after his departure to Persia. Originally Abdulla was to have proceeded on a hawking trip alone, and Sheikh Hamad thinks the outrage was timed to come off then as Abduila would only agree to it when he was out of Bahrein, he knowing that he would fall under suspicion. Later the plans were changed and he had to go with Hamad, so that the perpetrators had to commit the crime in the absence of Hamad also. Hamad says that he is the more convinced that Sheikh Isa (instigated by his wife as usual) was at the bottom of the affair, as they have been sending people to the Baharanah saying that, until they combined wilh the Sunnis to ask for the rule to be restored to Sheikh Isa, they would not be safe and Hamad could not protect them. Hamad also thinks that the party from Qatar had the assistance of a certain number of Nejdis who are known to have joined up with them, probably with Bin Baud's consent'. I have instructed Major Daly to take an opportunity to see Sheikh Lsa and warn him from me that he will be well advised to refrain from mixing himself up in any more intrigues. As Sheikh Isa well remembers Colonel Prideaux and has a wholesome fear of him, I added that it may have a good effect on the obstinate old gentleman to inform him that Colonel Prideaux will succeed me in April. It also seems desirable, if Sheikh Abdulla is found instigating crimes or mixing himself up in intrigues and evidence is brought forward to prove it, that he should be advised to reside outside Bahrein for a time, I presume if Sheikh Hamad states officially that Sheikh Abdulla's intrigues against him are insupportable, that he is unable to deal with him in Bahrein and that therefore he wishes to transfer jurisdiction over him to the British Government, I can, after evidence has been taken on oaih that he is conducting himself so as to be dangerous to peace and good order, issue an order under Article 21 (i) of the Bahrein Order in Council directing Sheikh Abdulla to reside elsewhere for two years.

There may be some truth in this as one of Mulla Zindiq's sons appeared at the trial and gave evidence for the defence, which was palpably false. They are of course Sunnis.

S ubject.— Sunni and Shiah troubles in Bahrein, In continuation of my letter No. 89-S., dated 2nd February 1924, on the subject of the Sitrah outrage, I have the honour to forward herewith the list of punishments awarded by Sheikh Hamad which was inadvertently omitted by the Political Agent in his memorandum 32-C., owing probably to the necessity of haste in oiHer to catch the mail. 2. Major Daly now reports;— ' The names of the persons sentenced are as follows:— (1) To suffer death penalty, if caught, and confiscation of all property in Bahrein— Selman bin Khalid. Ibrahim bin Khalid. Abdur Eazzak. Nasir bin Ahmad. Selman bin Mudhi, Ahmad Ruwaihi. Of the above, Selman bin Khalid and Abdur Razzak were already under sentence of one year's banishment, when they returned and committed this crime. (2) Salim bin Ambar (personal servant of Selman bin Khalid)i 10 years. (3) Ibrahim bu Mubarak bu Khammas, 8 years. (4) Habib Hasawi, Hussain Hasawi, Abu Humaideh, each 3 years, (5) Jasim bin Abdulla Daghath, 2 years. (6) Khalifeh Abu Shahab, Abdulla bin ^ Muhammad bin Shahin, Marzook bin Khamis, each 6 months'. 3. Major Daly was present during the trial as some of the prisoners were Nejdis and Hassawis. He says that the trial was conducted by Sheikh Hamad very properly and the evidence against the accused was very s rong. e himself kept a memorandum of the statements of witnesses, and considers tne sentences passed just and reasonable and in accordance with law. &gt; The Political Agent adds 1 'In connection with the above outrage Sheikh Hamad informed me yesterday that he had been forced mT fv fiion that the whole affair had been got up by Sheikh Easa and ms pa j4 amon^ A1 Khalifeh and that undoubtedly Abdulla had known that it would occur ^after his departure to Persia. Originally Abdulla was to have proceeded on a hawkin' trip alone, and Sheikh Hamad thinks the outrage was timed to come off then as Abdulla would only agree to it when he was out of Bahrein, he knowins that he would fall under suspicion. Later the plans were changed and he had to go with Hamad, so that the perpetrators had to commit the crime in the absence of Hamad also. Hamad says that he is the more convinced that Sheikh Isa (instigated by his wife as usual) was at the bottom of the affair, as they have been sending people to the Baharanah saying that until they combined with the Sunnis to ask for the rule to he restored to Sheikh Isa, they would not be safe and Hamad could not protect them. Hamad also thinks that the party from Qatar had the assistance of a certain number of Nejdis who are known to have joined up with them, probably with Bin Saud's consent'. I have instructed Major Daly to take an opportunity to see Sheikh Isa and warn him from me that he will be weU advised to refrain from mixing himself up in any more intrigues. As Sheikh Isa well remembers Colonel Prideaux and has a wholesome fear of him, I added that it may have a good effect on the obstinate old gentleman to inform him that Colonel Prideaux will succeed me in April. It also seems desirable, if Sheikh Abdulla is found instigating crimes or mixing himself up in intrigues and evidence is brought forward to prove it, that he should be advised to reside outside Bahrein for a time, I presume if Sheikh Hamad states officially that Sheikh Abdulla's intrigues against him are insupportable, that he is unable to deal with him in Bahrein and that therefore he wishes to transfer jurisdiction over him to the British Government, I can. after evidence has been taken on oath that he is conducting himself so as to be dangerous to peace and good order, issue an order under Article 21 (i) of the Bahrein Order in Council directing Bheikh Abdulla to reside elsewhere for two years.

If so, Nakhudas who keep proper accounts and keep their divers properly informed of the state of their account and treat them decently need never be interfered with by the State, or their financial posi tion, etc.. become public. The drawback to the suggested arrangement of having a special Pearl ing Department of State seems to me to be that it involves an excessive amount of State interference and makes the financial position of the Nakhudas public property, which in certain circumstances mav easily affect them adversely.

In their telegram No. 315-S. of 8th February (Serial No. 285). Foreign stated that Government are awaiting my proposals about the reform of the diving rules. As you know, I am rather of the opinion that the reforms outlined in para. 5 of your memorandum No.^ 208-C., dated 17th December 1923 (Enclo. of Serial No. 260) and repeated to Government in my Express Letter No. 712-S, dated 21st December 1923 (Serial No. 259), are too drastic and, in point of fact, lead to too much interference by the State in the Pearling Industry. Apart from this I do not know that there is sufficient time to in troduce it before the pearling season. In a communication some little time ago I myself outlined a scheme which may or may not be feasible, and I repeat it somewhat amplified below. Perhaps something on these lines might be tried this year and if it is not successful the other scheme of creat ing a separate State Department to run the Pearling Industry might be tried. The scheme I suggest is roughly this:— Shaikh Hamad should issue a proclamation stating that for some time past it has come to his knowledge that grave abuses exist in the pearling in dustry in Bahrain, particularly the slackness of the nakhudas in keeping accounts, the result of which is that divers cannot obtain their just dues. He therefore orders that all nakhudas should keep regular accounts which should begin with 'Guffal' 1923. The accounts should be drawn up on the lines of the sample account attached to the notification and should consist of a general account for the whole of the Nakhudas transactions, together with separate accounts for each diver and hauler; each of the latter should be given a small book containing a certified copy of this account. The amounts carried forward on to these accounts should be verified either from his previous account or by oath before the Qazi or by agreement between Nakhuda and diver. The proclamation might go on to say that ignorance of letters or figures on the part of the Nakhudas will not be accepted as an excuse for incorrect or improperly made out accounts, that Nakhudas must engage clerks if they cannot do the accounts themselves, a big Nakhuda a special clerk and the small nakhudas a share of a clerk. Finally he could say that a diver asking to have his account settled before the Salifah or the L XI—8992 Qazi has the right to call upon the nakhuda to produce his accounts for the information of the Court, and that any nakhuda refusing to produce his account will be non -suited and the case given against him, that is to say the diver will be held not to be induebted to the nakhuda and will receive a clear 'barwah' from the Joint Court, which will see that divers with such barwahs are not debarred from getting employment. Rough specimen forms of accounts are attached. They are possibly quite unsuitable but might be modified to suit the circumstances and the business. The main thing is to have an intelligible form of accounts and to insist on the Nakhudas keeping their accounts up in it and producing them when called upon to do so by a Court. Please consult Shaikh Hamad and the Qazi and other experienced per sons and see whether something of this sort cannot be done forthwith in time for the coming Pearling Season.Serial No. 296. — F rom the H onourable the P olitical R esident in the P ersian G ulf , M emorandum N o . 125-S. of 1924, dated B ushire, 17th (received 26 th ) F ebruary 1924.

Express letter to the Secretary to the Government op India in the F oreign and P olitical D epartment ^ D elhi N o. 27 -T bated the 13 th (received 17 th) March 1924. Subject : Bahrain Reforms. Pearling Industry. My endorsement No. 124-S. of 15tli February (Serial No. 295 in file No. 480-X.) Political Agent has consulted Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla and all agree that accounts on the lines I have suggested can be introduced, and that it would be advantageous to do so forthwith m time for this season. Accordingly I am telegraphing to Political Agent to get Shaikh Hamad to issue the necessary orders. The Shaikhs consider that the nakhudas will not like shar ing actual sale value of pearls for fear they should be taxed proportionately — a diver's share being taken as tax in most states. To obviate the chance of fraud and collusion between nakhudas and drivers to falsify the sale value of pearls the Shaikhs have decided to charge a regular license fee on pearl boats based on the average diver's share gained by such boats, but a great deal less. The .average for a good sized boat in Kuwait is considered to be about Rs. 500 and the Shaikhs propose to levy license fees in the grades according to the size of the boats, commencing at Rs. 250 for the large boats'. This will be much less than charged by other Shaikhs, but a clear gain in Bahrain where for many years no regular tax has been levied on pearling boats. -In anticipation of sanction I am authorizing the Political Agent to agree to Shaikh Hamad proceeding with the licenses for the coming season. 2. As another reform the Shaikh proposes to start a Hospital Dhow to tour round the pearl banks, and requires a Sub-Assistant Surgeon to be in charge. The expenses of this boat have been entered in the budget : the only difficulty is the Sub-Assistant Surgeon. Could Government aid the Shaikh by appointing a regular Sub Assistant Surgeon for foreign service in Bahrain for this duty ? He should be a Mohommedan, and must be a good sailor, preferably a man who has served on ships. He should be prepared to stay at least two years, as it will take him some time to learn the language and get into the work. Salary proposed Rs. 150 per mensem jj I us Rs. 25 per mensem when out with the Pearling Fleet. This man to,be any use this season should be nominated at o ice. In the off season the Sub-Assistant Surgeon would assist the Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital who has now a good deal of work. The Shaikh proposes to make him the Official Doctor and pay him a fixed retaining fee for tfiis duty, as well as his salary for Quarantine work. The Residency Surgeon considers the scheme for a Hospital Dhow a very good one and entirely approves of the suggestion that the Assistant Surgeon should be the Official Doctor and supervise the Hospital Dhow as well as the Victoria Memorial Hospital. As mentioned above I am authorizing Major Daly to get Shaikh Hamad to proceed with the new system of accounts and the licensing pearling dhows at once in anticipation of sanction in order to bring the system into operation this season. With the same object in view in the case of the Hospital Dhow will Govern ment be pleased to select a Sub-Assistant Surgeon as soon as possible ? Serial No. 2.—To the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in • the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, No, 57 -T., dated the 22nd (received 3 1st) March 1924.

In reply to your telegram No. 480-X., dated 15th March 1924 ( Seri f Jo. 301 in file No. 480-X.), I have the honour to submit herewith comments on ^ memorial.

M0221FD8: y; I i'w * f''l ■ &gt;, I ' Hk * J IP: 2. The rnemonal is a farrago of suppretsio veri and suggestio falsi; Skilvh Isa 5 s incompetency has been notorious for years. If it had been only incompetency, he could no doubt have been left in peace in his declining years, but when to the incompetency was added a love of oppression and tyranny and extreme rapacity it became imperative to intervene. Having had a rule of fifty-six years during which he never did a single act for the good of the State or people, and never spent a penny in Public Works—the pier and Custom House which he was compelled to build by outside pressure is no exception as the cost of these was met by a loan raised by the merchants which was repaid ' by increased landing and wharfage charges on goods improted by the merchants—in other words the merchants repaid themselves ! Shaikh Isa has had a good run for his money—or probably ' for other people's money ' would be more appropriate. 3. It may not be out of place to say a few words about the origin of this memorial. It has been got up in Bombay by Abdul W ahab Zayam who is a professional agitator, and who previous to the deposition of Shaikh Isa, had been a thorn in the latter's side for years, with his constant agitation for a so-called Parliament. It will be noticed that Abdul Wahab has brought this body into this memorial in the guise of a 'congress.' Abdul Wahab's 'parliament' con sisted (in his imagination) of a few men—certainly not more than a dozen all Sunnis, presided over and presumably nominated by himself ! Major Daly (with whom I discussed the petition and my draft reply when visiting Bahrain on 21st March) tells me that Abdul Wahab returned from Bombay (where he had been compelled to reside owing to the unpopularity of his views with the A1 Khalifa family) about the time he himself w T as appointed Political Agent. At first Major Daly, thinking Abdul Wahab was agitating for representative government, interested himself a good deal in the matter, having long interviews with Abdul Wahab, etc.; but as soon as he found out the true nature of Abdul Wahab's so- called parliament, he saw that it would be useless as even if it materialized and got power it would only transfer the power from the hands of the Shaikh to those of an oligarchy. Abdul Wahab's congress is described in paragraph 7 as including the ' Chiefs of the Tribes, Nobles, Ul&amp;na and Merchants ' and the 12 ' delegates' mentioned in paragraph 3 incjuded the ' Chiefs of the Taifa '. As a matter of fact-there are no real ' tribes ' worthy of the name in Bahrain—the Dowasir were the nearest approach to a real tribe but they have gone. Abdul Wahab alternately describes himself as the ' Chief of a Taifa ' or one of the ' Ulema He is neither (his only claim to being one of the ' Ulema ' consists in the white turban he habitually wears) being merely one of the members of the Zayani family which consists of a small number of well-to-do pealring nakhudas and traders. When getting up the last agitation (on my return from leave) Abdul Wahab is reported oh good authority to have raised 1lakhs in subscriptions, which he seems to have got out of the country. This report is to some extent confirmed by the heated altercation which took place (and was overheard) between Abdul Wahab and Abdul Latif when they were being deported in the course of which the latter accused the formes of having ' got away with ' all the funds subscribed. Doubt less Abdul Wahab is now enjoying the proceeds in Bombay, though he will no doubt have to pay up a fairly large sum to the lawyers and solicitors he has employed. But one thing, I think, is evident, viz., that as long as Abdul Wahab can get money from Shaikh Isa and others he will continue to earn a comfortable livelihood by agitating on the Shaikh's behalf. On the other hand Shaikh Isa is very old and doddering now and desires nothing, better than to be left in peace and this petition is not directly of his making. He desires to pass his declining years in peace and quiet but his wife, the mother of Abdulla, an old tyrant and Shaikh Isa's evil genius—assisted by various intriguers and agitators—will, not let him. 4. I am not aware what the procedure is in answering memorials, but if auy answer is to be given to this one I presume it will not be sent to the solicitors who drew it up or to Abdul, Wahab Zayani; I trust it will consist of a verbal reply to be delivered to the Shaikh by the Resident, or if a written answer is laid down by the regulations, a brief one to be read over and handed to Shaikh Isa by the Eesident o? ili Mlre^ r f |tosil® ce fcli® J 11 ' H i Jtr mad of Bin A] vlcero' fct Lvtomat Lernment ' struct 1 lei India. 1 fifed taki 1, Aft( ly the B: IkwHcli, i 2.

Tfc would be convenient if tlie answer could be senb prior to, or about the time of, Coiionel Prideaux's arrival, as tke- Shaikh; and mischief-makers at Bahrain are certain to petition and agitate on a change of Resident just as they did when I returned from leave, and if an unfavourable reply to the Shaikh's petition were delivered before or at Colonel Prideaux's first visit to the Island it would go iki'i far to silence the clamour. In any case it would not be advisable unless circum- stances urgently demand it—for my successor to visit Bahrain until he can take with him an answer from the Government of India to Shaikh Isa's petition,which will I trust be to the effect that they have nothing to add to the communications already made to him. fill m Copy forwarded with Gompliments to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for inform ation. witUsll Enclosure of Serial No. (2).— CoMMEifT on Memorial prom Shaikh Sir Isa Bin Ali At Khaum , K .C.S.I., of Bahrain, to His Excellency thbs Viceroy, dated 13th February 1924. When the memorial was forwarded to GoYernment it was not thought neces sary to make any comment as each and f very matter connected with the nus- eovernment oi Shaikh Isa and the reforms which were initiated m June 1923 under the instructions of His Majesty's Government have been reported to the Government of India But as comment has now been called for, the following remarks are offered taking the paragraphs of Shaikh Isa's memorial senahm. ){Ali I- After the words ' installed on the throne ' Shaik Isa has omitted to put ' by the British Government ' and inserted by the will and approbation, etc. for which, as far as is known, there is no authority. 2 Subiect to the proviso that the government of the Shaiks is reasonably good and not such as to bring odium on the Protecting Power Shaikh Isa has lot got to go farther than the removal of his predecessor and his own elevation to the Shaikhdom for precedent for interference by the British Governm.nt. I common report m Bnshire that Shaik Isa was installed as Shaikh on condition that he ruled well and with justice. Though'I have no official confirmation of this, rtt so com ^nly believed ind stated in Bushire and such a likely condition fcr Sir Lewis Pelly to have made, that I believe it to be coirect. 3 Shaikh has omitted reference to misgovernment which is a recognized feason for interference by the Protecting Power. , (ipscribes h's rule as ' peaceful and popular' ; it has been peaceful iLteTloTed 8 and' m^ toatinsuch a 0 way f^pujlr w'^ ^ ^ ft i^mptoalyunSu 3 - shown.

No ' innocent subjects ' have been punished nor any persons without' quiry or trial.' By ' abolition of all courts except one 'it is presumed the Shaikh means all courts except the Consular Court; if so he omits to mention that th only courts existing befor the Reforms were the Shara ' Courts, the Majlis el Urfi the Salifah Court, the Consular Court and the Joint Court, and these all exist to-dav except the Salifah Court which is in abeyance from inanition, &amp;s no one desires to . go before it as no justice can be obtained—its suspension however dat )d from before the reforms : more a rp - court m the shape of Shaikh Hamad's Court has been inaugurated which is very well managed and is greatly resorted to by litigants The Shaikh however by ' courts ' possibly refers to the ' Majlis ' which every Shaikh and Shaikhling had : these were not courts but irresponsible vehicles of oppression every Shaikh fining, imprisoning and expropriating the rayats (Shiahs only hien evtendu) at his own sweet will. ' Replacement of Manama Police, etc.' means tin irstitution of Police in Manama in place of a few inefficient ^ naturs ' (night- watchmen). It is true that most of the police are Persians and thus foreigners b it tins is simply because the local Arabs will not enlist as there is too much work to do. In point oi fact when the Police force was instituted every m mber of the Majlis was asked to produce some men from the community he represented The I ersians and Bahreinis did so, but the Arabs could not get any men to enlist! ' My son Hamad a youth, etc.' Shaikh Hamad admits to about 45 years and by appearance is at least 50, and has been doing a good part of the administration for two or three years before the reforms. This sentence is typical of the amount of truth m trie statemei.t made, and it is hoped that it is unnecessary to comment on all the rhetorical nonsense in this and many other paragraphs. 7. The ' congress of the aristocracy, etc.' consisted solely of a few Sunni pearling nakhndas and was m point of fact attended by very few persons exceDt the signatories to the egregious manifesto which with the' convening of the so-called congress was tne work of Abdul Wahab Zayani.

'Comment unnecessary. 14. ' Agitation by some members of the Shiah minority.' The Shiahs are in a very large majority and there is not one who has not a grievance against Shaikh Isa's maladministration and oppression— vide inter alia Bushire Residency letters Nos. 495-S., dated 30th December 1921 and 24-S., dated 6th January 1922 (Serial Nos. 1 and 3 in File No. 82, Nos. 1-32). ' Covetous eyes Pearl Fishery.' Shaikh Isa omits to thank the British Government for having prevented the owners of the said covetous eyes from possessing themselves of the fishery ; many attempts t^o do so having been made in the past and frustrated by the British Government in the interests of the Shaikh. The sentences following are rhetori cal and require no comment. The sentence 'Up to the present moment from me' is absolutely contrary to fact. Successive Political Agents and Residents have grown weary with repeated (and unavailing) efforts to get Shaikh Isa to set his house in order. The Shaikh emphatically denies his incapacity to manage the affairs of his State : both his sons Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Abdulla (although hostile to Shaikh Hamad) admit their father's total incapacity: the number of people (except certain members of the A1 Khalifa Jamily and others enabled to do as they pleased by reason of it) who endorse Shaikh Isa's opinion must be very small. His incapacity is notorious and has been so for years, 15. In the circumstances a formal trial of the Shaikh would hardly have been possible. The statement in the last sentence is not in accordance with fact. 16. It is hardly necessary to state that the vast majority of the people never had the smallest voice in the internal affairs of Bahrain ] the Dowasir tr.be and a section of the influential Sunni nokhudas ignored the Government and did what they liked while the Shiah population and all the weak were tyrannized over by it. The Shaikh has again ignored the obligation to govern properly. The rest of the paragraph is mainly rhetorical. 17. Comment on this seems hardly necessary. Bushire letter No. 42-S., dated 27th January 1923 (Serial No. 37 in File No. 82-X.) set forth the pros and cons of undertaking the reforms at length and foretold that to introduce tht.in the deposition of Shaikh Isa would be necessary. Government however decided to proceed with the reforms, so that in the circumstances the blame for the Shaikh s deposition (if any) does not lie with the consular authorities concerned. R. I. M. S.

I have the honour to forward herewith an extract from the ' Bombay Chronicle ' of April 23rd, 1924, containing a number of malicious and untruthful statements re garding the present condition of affairs in Bahrain; together with a copy of a memo randum from the Political Agent, Bahrain, which deals with the various alleged grievances set forth in the paper. Enclosure No. 1.—Extract from 'Bombay Chronicle', dated the 23 rd April 1924. The Plight of Bahrain. To The Editor of ' The Chronicle r S ir, The people of Bahrain have all along been consoling themselves by a belief that the superior British authorities on being acquainted with the details of tlie aggressions perpetrated against the people and encroachment made on their liberty,, would not approve of such a policy ; while in iact, it is to be regretted that the above- belief is now being shunned by degree^ owing to some one of the three presump tions, viz :— (1) That either the British Government have directed and are aware of the course of policy pursued in their country, ignorant of the fact that it would tend to convert tiie anxiety and frjght t)f the people into desperation when they ha^e-lost every hope of attaining justice and equity. (2) That the British Government relies on the Consul's reports, believing tlie v petitions of the people contradicting the former s reports. If it is ; so, then at least it betrays negligence on the part of the British Government with regard to investigating for justice in spite of the people of Bahrain having requisitioned the Government to depute an unbiased Commission to enquire into the grievances of the people of Bharain. (3) That the British Government intend and mean to hold an enquiry into the affairs at Bahrain but pending enquiry have not asked the Consuls at the Persian Gulf to put a stop to their despotic policy, which is the'worst of the three. Whereas we on our part have been awaiting the result though our patience has now betrayed us. f While we were expecting a change in the policy which has clearly manifested itself to have marred the prestige and renown of Great Britain in the Eastern Territories of the Arabian Peninsula, lo we see Major Delly (Da y) adopting fresh ways of aggression, evincing further stupidity by further proving him self to be the sole creator of the galling miseries for Arabs in their own country. . So he has forced conscript labour on the helpless natives of Bahrain driving them like cattle and sub jecting them to hard labour at Ard ', announcing that he wanted to erect there a station loi airships. He has transgressed the bounds of law, indeed. Courtesy is unknown to him. He did not even ask Shaikh Isa, Chief of Bahrain, for his consent before putting his scheme for erecting the said station into effect. Further he has announced to have fixed a heavy tax on all boats regardless of their being the pearl-fishing ones or otherwise having changed their numbers into English ngures which the natives are not expected to make out. The most horrible act of his is that he has reduced the members of the EtiliDg ret s family to the state of confinees in Bahrain ■ for when most cf them asked or permit to enable them to go abroad on medical grounds or seme such other urgent reasons the same was denied to them. Lately he seems to have been much- perturbed on reading articles in newspapers criticising the course of policy pursued m Lahmm and attempted consequently to cause some respectable family members 0 16 u ' m g Chief by force to repudiate the said articles as false through news papers, ut in vain , ior the latter even at the risk of exposing themselves to his- revenge on them, denied to agree with his request. It is likelv that some of them u timately may yield under his threats and helplessly may attest a false statement- he may^dictate to them.. y JDU 7 We lieard some time ago that the people of Bahrain with their Chief Shaikh Isa at their head had submitted their grievances to the Viceroy of India, which report is now confirmed by what conversation we had with some respectable men of Bahrain and they were very anxiously awaiting a repll^ to the said representation hazarding their conjectures simultaneously in various ways. We cannot but suggest to the benign British Government that the investiga tions into the affairs of Bahrain should not terminate in asking report from the antagonists only, when it is evident that they, possessing powers, can with threats and inducements, rally false witnesses who may give evidence innocently with good intentions in their own opinions. For this only reason we entreat the Government to investigate into the case of Bahrain directly and under their immediate supervisioru What a crucification of justice and humanity would it be should the Government, Owing to their other encumbrances, postpone the trial of the case of the helpless, melancholy and persecuted people of Bahrain indefinitely ; Bahrain to-day is rolling in the lowest abyss of misery and disdain, awaiting rescue at the hands of the wisest judge. His Excellency Lord Reading, the Viceroy of India. Will he disappoint them ? Most probably not; but if he did, which God forbid : and Bahrain became the scene of action of the helpless desperates, then very likely it will be said that' the people of Bahrain were fanatics and intolerant towards the people following other religions. We do not intend here to repeat our obligations done to Great Britain by our treatment of her in season and out of season for we do not seek for a favour in return,- nay we ask for justice and justice only. We ask her to treat us according to the pledge she herself had drafted and approved of. We are aware that some individuals of the minor ' Shia ' community at Bahrain have abandoned their self-respect and are seelHng af fcer their selfish motives. Hence Major Delly (Daly) can easily make them tools in getting statements written by them as may satisfy his' desire. But will the lovers of justice esteem it chival rous and honourable to take advantage of such a religious discord ^ By God, stoop ing to such ignoble measures is a stigma on the forehead of humanity and a stain of disgrace on the face of civilization.- Yours, etc., ' L Enclosure No. 2.—Copy of a confidential memorandum from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Ino. ilO-C., dated the 14th May 1924.

The tax was introduced by the Shaikh after consultation with me and the approval of the Hon'ble the Resident. Boats have been numbered with a distinguishing letter (B) to denote Bahrain and the registered number. This is in accordance with the system existing all over the Gulf. No numbers have been ' changed ' such boats as were numbered previously bore ordinary numerals, but the majority did not register although registration has theoretically been in force for some years. (3) No member of the ruling family has been deterred from travelling. A'great many of them travel from time to time. As a matter of form they generally ask Shaikh Hamad's permission before going, (4) Some time ago Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa told Shaikh Hamad that he would like to make it known that he now supported his rule. Shaikh Hamad suggested to him that as he had been instrumental in starting a press campaign against him in the past, he might write a letter to the press stating what his views now are. He wrote a short letter to some Arabic papers— I do not know whether it has appeared in the press or not. Doubtless it is to this that the writer refers. Probably the information was supplied to him by Shaikh Abdulla's son, Mahomed, who has always been a supporter of Abdul Wahab. Some months back, at the suggestion of the Resident, this young man was fined by Shaikh Hamad for intriguing. The ' Bombay Chronicle ' apparently readily lends itself to this sort of article. The tone of a letter about education at Aden which appears on the same page is very similar. I am informed that about two years ago some action was taken by the Government of Bombay against the Editor for permitting seditious articles to appear.

S ubject :— Bahrain Reforms. Pearling Industry. My endorsement No. 124-S. of IStli February (Serial No. 295 in file No. 480-X.) Folitical Agent has consulted Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla and all agree that ■aeeeunts on the lines I have suajgested can be introduced, and that it would be advantageous to do so forthwith in time for this season. Accordingly I am telegraphing to Political Agent to get Shaikh Hamad to issue the necessary orders. The Shaikhs consider that the nakhudas will not like shar'ng actual sale value of pearls for fear they should be taxed proportionately — a diver's share being taken as tax in most states. To obviate the chance of fraud and collusion between nakhudas and drivers to falsify the sale value of pearls the Shaikhs have decided to charge a regular license fee on pearl boats based on the average diver's share gained by such boats, but a great deal less. The average for a good sized boat in Kuwait is considered to be about Rs. 500 and the Shaikhs propose to levy license fees in the grades according to the size of the boats, commencing at Rs. 250 for the large boats. This will bo much less than charged by other Shaikhs, but a clear gain in Bahrain where for many years no regular tax has been levied on pearling boats. In anticipation of sanction I am authorizing the Political Agent to agree to Shaikh Hamad proceeding with the licenses for the coming season. 2. As another reform the Shaikh proposes to start a Hospital Dhow to tour round the pearl banks, and requires a Sub-Assistant Surgeon to be m charge. _ The expenses of this boat have been entered in the budget: the only difficulty is the jSub-Assistant Surgeon, Could Government aid the Shaikh by appointing a regular Sub Assistant Surgeon for foreign service in Bahrain for this duty 1 He should be a Mohommedan, and must be a good sailor, preferably a man who has served on ships. He should be prepared to stay at least two years, as it will take him some time to learn the language and get into the work. Salary proposed Rs. 150 per mensem flus Rs. 25 per mensem when out with the leaning Fleet. This man to be any use this season should be nominated at o ice.

Having had a rule of fifty-six years during which he never did a single act for the good of the State or people, and never spent a penny in Public Works—the pier and Custom House which he was compelled to build by outside pressure is no exception as the cost of these was met by a loan raised by the merchants which was repaid ' by increased landing and wharfage charges 'on goods improted by the merchants—in other words the merchants repaid themselves ! Shaikh Isa has had a good run for his money—or probably ' for other people's money ' would be more appropriate. 3. It may not be out of place to say a few words about the origin of thi&amp; memorial. It has been got up in Bombay by Abdul ahab Zayani who is a professional agitator, and who previous to the deposition of Shaikh Isa, had been a thorn in the latter's side for years, with his constant agitation for a so-called Parliament. It will be noticed that Abdul Wahab has brought, this body into this memorial in the guise of a ' congress.' Abdul Wahab's ' parliament' con sisted (in his imagination) of a few men—certainly not more than a dozen all Sunnis, presided over and presumably nominated by himself ! Major Daly (with whom I discussed the petition and my draft reply when visiting Bahrain on 21st March) tells me that Abdul Wahab returned from Bombay (where he had been compelled to reside owing to the unpopularity of his views with the A1 Khalifa family) aboujb the time he himself was appointed Political Agent. At first Major Daly, thinking Abdul Wahab was agitating for representative government, interested himself a good deal in the matter, having long interviews wifeh Abdul Wahab, etc.; but as soon as he found out the true nature of Abdul Wahab's so- called parliament, he saw that it would be useless as even if it materialized and got power it would only transfer the power from the hands of the Shaikh to tkoser of an oligarchy. Abdul Wahab's congress is described in paragraph 7 as including the ' Chiefs 1 of the Tribes, Nobles, Ulema and Merchants ' and the 12 ' delegates' mentioned in paragraph 8 included the ' Chiefs of the Taifa As a matter of fact there are no real ' tribes ' worthy of the name in Bahrain—the Dowasir were the nearest approach to a real tribe but they have gone. Abdul Wahab alternately describes himself as the ' Chief of a Taifa ' or one of the ' Ulema He is neither (his only claim to being one of the ' Ulema ' consists in the white turban he habitually wears) being merely one of the members of the Zayani family which consists of a small number of well-to-do pealring nakhudas and traders. When getting up the last agitation (on my return from leave) Abdul Wahab is reported on good authority to have raised 1J lakhs in subscriptions, which lie seems to have got out of the country. This report is to some extent confirmed by the heated altercation which took place (and was overheard) between Abdul Wahab and Abdul Latif when they.were being deported in the course of which the latter accused the former of having ' got away with ' all the funds subscribed. Doubt less Abdul Wahab is now enjoying the proceeds in Bombay, though he will no doubt have to pay up a fairly large sum to the lawyers and solicitors he has employed. But one thing, I think, is evident, viz., that as long as Abdul Wahab can get money from Shaikh Isa and others he will continue to earn a comfortable livelihood by agitating on the Shaikh's behalf. On the other hand Shaikh Isa is very old and doddering now and desires nothing better than to be left in peace and this petition is not directly of his making. He desires to pass his declining years in peace and quiet but his wife, the mother of Abdulla, an old tyrant and Shaikh Isa's evil genius—assisted by various intriguers and agitators—will not let him. 4. I am not aware what the procedure is in answering memorials, but if any answer is to be given to this one I presume it will not be sent to the solicitors who drew it up or to Abdul ahab Zayani; I trust it will consist of a verbal reply to be delivered to the Shaikh by digs -Resident, or if a written answer is laid down by the regulations, a brief one to, be read over and handed to Shaikh Isa by the Resident or \I ■the Political Agent. It would be convenient if the answer could be sent prior to, or about the time of. Colonel Prideaux's arrival, as the Shaikk and mischief-makers at Bahrain are certain to petition and agitate on a change of Resident just as they did when I returned from leave, and if an unfavourable reply to the Shaikh's petition were delivered before or at Colonel Prideaux's first visit to the Island it would go far to silence the clamour. In any case it would not be advisable unless circum stances urgently demand it—-for my successor to visit Bahrain until he can take with him an answer from the Government of India to Shaikh Isa's petition,which will I trust be to the effect that they have nothing to add to the communications already made to him.

C.S.I. , of B ahrain, to H is E xcellency the V iceroy, dated I ^th F ebruary 1924. When the memorial was forwarded to Government it was not thought neces sary to make any comment as each and rveyy matter connected with the mis- government of Shaikh Isa and the reforms which were initiated in June 1923 under the instructions of His Majesty's Government have been reported to the Government of India. But as comment has now been called for, the following remarks are offered taking the paragraphs of Shaikh Isa's memorial seriatim. 1. After the words ' installed on the throne ' Shaik Isa has omitted to put ' by the British Government ' and inserted ' by the will and approbation, etc.' 5 for which, as far as is known, there is no authority. 2. Subject to the proviso that the government of the Shaiks is reasonably good and not such as to bring odium on the Protecting Power. Shaikh Isa has not got to go farther than the removal of his predecessor and his own elevation to the Shaikhdom for precedent for interference by the British Government. It is ccmnion report m Bushire that Shaik Isa was installed as Shaikh on condition that he ruled well and with justice. Though I have no official confirmation of this^ it is so commonly believed and stated in Bushire, and such a likely condibion fcr Sir Lewis Pelly to have made, that I believe it to be correct. 3. Shaikh has omitted reference to misgovernment which is a recognized reason for interference by'the Protecting Power. 4. Shaikh describes h s rule as ' peaceful and popular ' ; it has been peaceful from outside aggression thanks to the^ protection of the British Government, but bv no means so internally for the indigenous population who have been nl- treated, looted and murdered by Shaikh Isa and with perfect impunity by every member of his own family and all the petty Shaikhs of the Al Khalifa who desired to act in such a way ; and popular with a small section of the Sunm tribal heads and nakhudas becarse they could do what they liked. It is emphaticady unpopu lar with the Shiah majority as countless petitions and reports have shown. 5 No ' consul ' as far as is known has ever reported favourably on Shaikh Isa's Government. ' Toleration ' would describe^ the feelings of most of the ' consuls ' better than ' friendliness and goodwill. 6, Before coming to Bahrain Major Daly was serving in Jfesopotamia for three years ; there is .10 evidence he conceived a serious dislike for th. Arab reo-ple'' &lt;c Forcing on me inadmissible concessions a parentiy refers to th. proposed, oil concefsion to the D'Arcy Exploration C ^Xre to to promise all that was done was to endeavour to make the S ^. ^ not to grant a concession to a company not approved by the British Gover: 1 and to give one rather to the D'Arcy Company whose applicaton had been m two vears earlier rather than the Eastern Syndicate. -The febaikh reters to ' the extraordinary plea of old age, etc.'-far from cord. ' Wholesale fining, imprisonments, and deportations means as re 0 aid3m ill | I I ^ t K l the first two punishments only tlie normal work of tlie district, tlie numbers being by no means excessn e, and as regards the third pumsnment it has been inflicted spar ingly, only some half dozen or so deportations having been made and each case^has been 'reported to Government and sanction obtained in advance in all cases except one. No ' innocent subjects ' have been punished nor any^persons without' in quiry or trial.' By ' abolition of all courts except one '' it is presumed tlie Shaikh means all courts except the Consular Court; if so he omits to mention that the only courts existing befor the Eeforms were the Shara ' Courts, the Majlis el Urfi, the Salifah Court, the Consular Court and the Joint Court, and these all exist to-day except the Salifah Court which is in abeyance from inanition, as no one desires to go before it as no justice can be obtained—its suspension however dat ;d from before the reforms : more a ne court in the shape of Shaikh Hamad's Court has been inaugurated which is very well managed and is greatly resorted to by litigants. The Shaikh however by ' courts ' possibly reftrs to the ' Majlis '' which every Shaikh and Shaikhling had : these were not courts out im sponsible vehicles of oppression, every Shaikh fining, imprisoning and expropriating the rayats (Shiahs only bien evtendv) at his own sweet will. ' Replacement of Manama Police, etc.' means 5bh^ irstitution of Police in Manama in place of a few inefficient ' naturs ' (night- watchmen). It is true that most of the police are Persians and thus foreigners b it this is simply because the local Arabs will not enlist as there is too much work to do. In point of fact when the Police force was instituted every m mher of the Majlis was asked to produce some men from the community he represented. The Persians and Bahreinis did so, but the Arabs could not get any men to enlist! ' My son Hamad a youth, etc.' Shaikh Hamad admits to about 45 years and by appearance is at least 50, and has been doing a good part of the administration for two or three years before the reforms. This sentence is typical of the amount of truth in the statement made, and it is hoped that it is unnecessary to comment on all the rhetorical nonsense in this and many other paragraphs. 7. The ' congress of the aristocracy, etc.' consisted solely of a few Sunni pearling nakhudas and was in point of fact attended by Very few persons except the signatories to the egregious manifesto which with the convening of the so-called congress was the work of Abdul Wahab Zayani. It is worthy of note that even of the few signatories too told Shaikh Hamad they were compelled to sign, one decrepit old gentleman saying that his hand was actually held and made to write the name by force ! A report on all this however was submitted to Gov- eroment under cover of Bushire Residency letters Nos. 602-S., and 622-S., dated 27th October and 10th November 1923. (Serial Nos. 208 and 225 in File No. 480-X.). 8. As the memorial was submitted to Colonel Trevor immediately on his return from leave obviously in the hope that the poljcy inaugurated by Colonel Knox would be reversed, it was necessary to disabuse the signatories at once ot' such a hope, but the telegram does not appear to be minatory and insulting:, the English version is forwarded herewith. The telegram was sent on 26th October and acknowledged by Major Daly on 27th October (c/. enclosure of Serial No. 208 ibid). The Dowasir migrated about 15th November though they had been threatening to do so for months past. The actual reason for their departure was because they had be^n fined Rs. 15,000 at the suggestion of Colonel Knox for the brutal murder of a number of the Shiah inhabitants of the village of Ali including women and also of two Shiali Ulema in the immediate neighbourhood of their principal village. The money recovered as a fine was paid as compensation to the heirs of the killed : the tribe thus got off without any punishment for the dastardly outrages they had committed. 9 and 10. r ihe presentation of the petition and the proceedings alluded to have been fully reported in Bushire letter No. 622-S, dated 10th November 1923 (Serial No. 225 in File No. 480-X.). The two persons were deported at the urgent request of Shaikh Hamad, and they were informed personally by the Political Agent by the direction of the Political Resident of the reason for their deportation. 11. Abdul Wahab Zayani and Ahmed bin Lahej were removed at the request of Shaikh Hamad and the proceedings were described in Bushire letter No. 622-b.r dated 10th November ,1923 (Pro. No. 225 ibid). i i \9^, '12. This is a matter of opinion. Any intelligent person liowever cannot fail to see a vast improvement. liiven Bin Saud (who officially opposes the reforms and supports Shaikh Isa as the protagonist of Islam) admitted in private conver sation with a recent visitor to Hassa that the state of the Islands has vastly im proved while the Shaikhs are better off finanacially than they ever were before. 13. Comment unnecessary. 14. ' Agitation by some members of the Shiah minority.' The Shiahs are in a very large majority and there is not one who has not a grievance against Shaikh Isa's maladministration and oppression— vide mter afe Bushire Residency letters Nos. 495-S., dated 30th December 1921 and 24-S., dated 6th January 1922 (Serial Nos. 1 and 3 in File No. 82, Nos. 1-32). ' Covetous eyes Pearl Fishery/ 8 Shaikh Isa omits to thank the British Government for having prevented the ,owners of the said covetous eyes from possessing themselves of the fishery ; many attempts to do so having been made in the past and frustrated by the British Government in the interests of the Shaikh. The sentences following are rhetori cal and require no comment. The sentence 'Up to the present moment . ....... .from me ' is absolutely contrary to fact. Successive Political Agents and Residents have grown weary with repeated (and unavailing) efforts to get Shaikh Isa to set his house in order. The Shaikh emphatically denies his incapacity to manage the affairs of his State ; both his sons Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Abdulla (although hostile to Shaikh Hamad) admit their father's total incapacity; the number of people (except certain members of the A1 Khalifa iamily and others enabled to do as they pleased by reason of it) who endorse Shaikh Isa's opinion must be very small. His incapacity is notorious and has been so for years. 15. In the circumstances a formal trial of the Shaikh would hardly have been possible. The statement m the last sentence is not in accordance with fact.. 16. It is hardly necessary to state-that the vast majority of the people never had the smallest voice m the internal affairs of Bahrain , the Dowasir tr.be and a section of the influential Sunni nokhudas ignored the Government and did what they liked while the Shiah population and all the weak were tyrannized over by it. The Shaikh has again ignored the obligation to govern properly. The rest of the paragraph is mainly rhetorical. 17. Comment on this seems hardly necessary. Bushire letter No. 42-S., dated 27th January 1923 (Serial No. 37 in File No. 82-X.) set forth the pros and ^ cons of undertaking the reforms at length and foretold that to introduce them the deposition of Shaikh Isa would be necessary. Government however decided to proceed with the reforms, so that in the circumstances the blame for the Shaikh s deposition (if any) does not lie with the consular authorities concerned. R. 1. M. S.

I have the honour to forward herewith an extract from the ' Bombay Chronicle ' of April 23rd, 1924, containing a number of malicious and untruthful statements re garding the present condition of affairs in Bahrain; together with a copy of a memo randum from the Political Agent, Bahrain, which deals with the various alleged grievances set forth in the paper. Enclosure No. 1.—Extract from 'Bombay Chronicle dated the 23rd April 1924. T he P light of B ahrain. To The Editor of ' The Chronicle ( S ir, The people of Bahrain have all along been consoling themselves by a belief that the superior British authorities on being acquainted with the details of the aggressions perpetrated against the people and encioachment made on their liberty, would not approve of such a policy ; while in xact, it is to be regretted that the above belief is now being shunned by degrees owing to some one of the three presump tions, viz :— (1) That either the British Government have directed and are awate of the course of policy pursued in their country, ignorant of the fact that it would tend to convert tne anxiety and fright of the people into desperation when they have lost every hope of attaining justice and equity. (2) That the British Government relies on the Consul's reports, believing the petitions of the people contradicting the former s reports. If it is so, then at least it betrays negligence on the part of the British Government with regard to investigating for justice in spite of the people of Bahrain having requisitioned the Government to depute an unbiased Commission to enquire into the grievances of the people of Bharain. (3) That the British Government intend and mean to hold an enquiry into the affairs at Bahrain but pending enquiry have not asked the Consuls at the Persian Gulf to put a stop to their despotic policy, which is the worst of the three. Whereas we on our part have been awaiting the result though our patience has now betrayed us. \ While we were expecting a change in the policy which has clearly manifested itself to have marred the prestige and renown of Great Britain in the Eastern Territories of the Arabian Peninsula, lo we see Major Delly (Da.y) adopting fresb ^ ays of aggression, evincing further stupidity by further proving him self to be the sole creator of the, galling miseries for Arabs in their own country. So he has forced conscript labour on the helpless natives of Bahrain driving them like cattle and sub jecting them to hard labour at Ard ', announcing that he wanted to erect there a station for airships. He has transgressed the bounds of law, indeed. Courtesy ]s unknown to him. He did not eveii ask Shaikh Isa, Chief of Bahrain, for his (onsent beiore putting his scheme for erecting the said station into effect. Further Le has announced to have fixed a heavy tax on all boats regardless of their being the pearl-fishing ones or otherwise having changed their numbers into English figures which the natives are not expected to make out. The most horrible act of his is that he has reduced the members of the Puling Chief s family to the state of confinees in Bahrain ; for when most of them asked for peimit to enable them to go abroad on medical grounds or seme such other urgent reasons the same was denied to them. Lately he seems to have been much perUirbcd on reading articles in newspapers criticising the course of policy pursued ^ attempted consequently to cause some respectable family members ot the Puling Chief by force to repudiate the said articles as false through news papers, but in vain , lor the latter even at the risk of exposing themselves to his' revenge on them^denied to agree with his request. It is likely t^at some of th^m u imate y may yield under his threats and helplessly may attest a false statement- he m&amp;y dictate to them.i ] 1 lev ^| ®Ivesl||l tiiedetiip leontifiy tedtklii; lett it it wife leatky ' orts,^: ■ reporti, fi: | nt ofi :e in f menttctal jso; We heard soffie time ago tKat tlie people of Baliraift with their Chief Shaikh Isa at their head had submitted their grievances to the Viceroy of India, which report is now confirmed by what conversation we had with some respectable men of Bahrain and they were 'very anxiously awaiting a reply to the said representation hazarding their conjectures simultaneously in various Ways. 'VVe cannot but suggest to the benign British G overnment that the investiga tions into the affairs of Bahrain should not terminate m asking report from the antagonists only, when it is evident that they, possessing powers, can with threats and inducements, rally false witnesses Who may give evidence innocently with good intentions in their own opinions. For this only reason we entreat the Government to investigate into the case of Bahrain directly and under their immediate supervision* What a crucification of justice and humanity would it be should the Government, owing to their other encumbrances^ postpone the trial of the case of the helpless, melancholy and persecuted people of Bahrain indefinitely ; Bahrain to-day is rolling in the lowest abyss of misery and disdain, awaiting rescue at the hands of the wisest judge, His Excellency Lord Reading, the Viceroy of India. Will he disappoint them ? Most probably not; but if he did, which God forbid : and Bahrain became the scene of action of the helpless desperates, then very likely it will be said that the people of Bahrain were fanatics and intolerant towards the people following other religions. We do not intend here to repeat our obligations done to Great Britain by our treatment of her in season and out of season for we do not seek for a favour in return, nay we ask for justice and justice only- We ask her to treat us according to the pledge she herself had drafted and approved of. We are aware that some individuals of the minor ' Shia ' community at Bahrain have abandoned their self-respect and are seeking after their selfish motives. Hence Major Delly (Daly) can easily make them tools in getting statements written by them as may satisfy his desire. But will the lovers of justice esteem it chival rous and honourable to take advantage of such a religious discord ^ By God, stoop ing to such ignoble measures is a sbigma on the forehead of humanity and a stain of disgrace on the face of civilization,, Yours, etc., 44 L ■dtoei# jefet m igjj into f Enclosure No. 2.—cdpy of a confidential memorandum prom the P olitical A gent, B a H rAiN, To the P olitical R esident in the P ersian G ulp, N o. ilo-c., dated the 14th may 19244 I beg to forward herewith an article w r hich has appeared in the Bombay Chroni cle.' It is without doubt inspired, if not actually written, by the deportee Abdul Wahab Zayani, who, some months ago contributed a similar letter to this paper. The grievances which he now sets forth are interesting. (1) The aerodrome.—At the Ruler's (Shaikh Hamad) request the aerodrome Was made in place of one which Shaikh Isa had agreed to, and made, some yeais back. It was made because the Shaikh wanted to use the old aerodrome as a buiid-- ing site. At his request I supervised the work m order that it might be carried on in accordance with the advice o£ an Air Force Officer who selected the site to which Shaikh Hamad agreed. Labour wfts supplied bv the Shaikh s order from various surrounding villages. The villagers were paid and ted at the expense of the bhaik a s Government. They have since several times offered to do any more work should it be required, but' no more is necessary! Shaikh Isa was not consulted such matters are now dealt with by Shaikh Hamad. /■crt 'Boat Tax An initial registration fee of Rs. 5 for all boats except small fishing bSts^ Ims^een collected by the Shaikh's Government. Renewals cost Rs. 2 annually ! Pearling licenses of Rs. 200, Rs. 100 and Rs. 75 f , accord ^ t0 X, tlx amount similarly been issued for boats actually engage in e pear i collected to less than half the tax collected at Kuwai , ^a ar o. ..Vtv .llprited from Shiah^ torn all classes whereas, in the past a much heavier tax was collected from Shiatowhile the Simni Nakhudas, to which class Abdul Wahab Zayani belongs, escaped all taxation. The tax was introduced by the Shaikh after consultation with me and the approval of the Hon ble the Resident. Boats have been numbered with a distinguishing letter (B) to denote Bahrain and the registered number. This is in accordance with the system existing all over the Gulf. No numbers have been ' changed ' such boats as were numbered previouslv bore ordinary numerals, but the majority did not register although registration has theoretically been in force for some years. (3) No member of the ruling family has been deterred from travelling. A great many of them travel from time to time. As a matter of form they generally ask Shaikh Hamad's permission before going,. (4) Some time ago Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa told Shaikh Hamad that he would like to make it known that he now supported his rule. Shaikh Hamad suggested to him that as he had been instrumental in starting a press campaign against him in the past, he might write a letter to the press stating what his views now are. He wrote a short letter to some Arabic papers—I do not know whether it has appeared in the press or not. Doubtless it is to this that the writer refers. Probably the information was supplied to him by Shaikh Abdulla's son, Mahomed, who has always been a supporter of Abdul Wahab. Some months back, at the suggestion of the Resident, this young man was fined by Shaikh Hamad for intriguing. The ' Bombay Chronicle ' apparently readily lends itself to this sort of article. The tone of a letter about education at Aden which appears on the same page is very similar. I am informed that about two years ago some action was taken by the Government of Bombay against the Editor for permitting seditious articles to appear. \ i lasirr—n 6-24—r—cips ty I^H St rial No 26.' t . a8 ^fe {Confidential.) otte^ V No 23/334-S. of 1924. ■Mii ntWl if H efers, bhe m$k itrigiw, to tlisfflitii 5 on ties: British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, the 7th (received 16th) June 1924.

Some weeks ago Habis bin 'Ashwan, of the Ubaiyat family of the Aulad Wasil sub-section of the Buraih section of the Mutair, raided the Awazim*. 'J'he latter appealed to Ibn Sa'ud, who ordered restitution to be made, and told the 'Awazim that they could attack Ibn 'Ashwan if he did not comply with his orders. Ibn 'Ashwan made excuses and refused to disgorge all the plunder and so on the 20th May the Awazim, under their paramount Shaikh, Ibn Jami' of the Hedalin sub-section of the Ku'ah .section of the tribe, with th ree hairaqs attacked Ibn 'Ashwan at Nuqair (Indjair on the' Asia 1 ; 1,000,000 Maps), 110 miles S. S. E. of Kuwait. Ibn Ashwan had only about 150 men but put up a very stubborn fight, though greatly out numbered by the 'Awazim. Ibn 'Ashwan himself, his son, and more than half his followers were killed, and the Awazim, whose losses were also extremely heavy, captured all their property. The survivors appealed for he^.p to Haif al-Fuqam of the Sahabah family of the Muwahah sub-division of the 'Ilwah section of the Mutair. who attacked a section of the 'Awazim under Shaikh Duraf and recovered a portion of the plunder. Fuqam himself, however, was wounded and is believed to have died. The Mutair have sent word to Faisal ad-Dawish, but up to the present (here is no word of his moving. The 'Ajman. under Dhaidan al-Hithlain, have allied themselves with the 'Awazim and promised them assistance should they require it. Ibn Sa ud ,s action in giving the 'Awazim permission to attack Ibn 'Ashwan has caused much comment in Kuwait, and speculation is rife as to what he wul do now. According to one rumour he had intended to go to Hasa about now. (Signed) J. C. MORE, Major, Political Agent, Kuwait, py ; with compliments, to the: — Secretary to H. E.

Relations of the Sultan of I am informfed that Mulla Tlnfidh, who recently went to Nejd, after the dissolution of the Kuwait Conference has been a PP 01 ° te ^ s f ° rt ° a adviser to Bin Saud on ' Foreign Affairs . He has recently formesome sort of Delegation to be sent to Transjordania, apparently with the obiect of attracting to Bin Saud any malcontents. The line they are said to'be intending to take is that King Hussain and the Sharifian family have ' sold ' their countries for British gold and that Bin Saud is the only real Arab patriot who has withstood the attempts of Gi^eat Britain to absorb his country, frustrated her efforts at the Kuwait Conference to bring Nejd under British domination, etc. If the news be true, it would appear to be the Sultan's idea to set up as the champion of Arab liberty as a counterblast to Hussain's assumption of the Khalifate. Whatever the movement is, we may be certain, if Mullah Hafidh has a hand in it, that it will be ant^-British. He has freely adver tised that he alone ' saved ' Nepi at the Kuwait Conference. Bin Saud is said to be shortly coming to Hasa again. GCP 'Denu—L XI—273-7-8-24-7.Serial No 270. No. 361-S. British Residency and Consulate-Greneral, Bushire, the 22rid June (received 2nd July) 1924.

S ir, I have the honour to forward a letter (with a translation made in this office) in Arabic addressed to His Majesty the King, which was handed by one Mohamed Ali al Nagdi to the Political Resident at Aden, who for- warded it on to me. The letter purports to emanate from the Sultan of Ntejd and to bear in addition the signatures and seals or thumb impressions of six other Nejdis. Being doubtful of its authenticity, I sent it to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for his opinion. I enclose a copy of his reply. We know that the Sultan reached Hofuf on the 15th January 1924, and did not leave the Hasa area until the 25th of February.

He has made His prophets, His messengers and His angels superior to all the rest of His creatures, whatever they may be, except to His own self and His attributes. And He has sent down His Books and His words to all His angels. His prophets and messengers. He is worthy of praise and He is holy in His Kingdom in the highest heaven All are powerless to gain knowledge of Him. God is the Almighty, there is no God but Him alone. No one knows what He is but He himself The reins of affairs are all in His hand; they are pre-ordained and they ultimate!} return to Him. He wore the throne without really sitting thereupon or having a seat there. There was God and no space existed then. And He is now as He was before. Nothing was hidden from Him whether far or near. He knows all that revolves in the consciences of His slaves. He is aware of their secret intentions. He is unique in the administration of His kingdom. He hears and He can see. He gives and takes away He rewards and punishes. He honours and He despises. He creates aod grants livelihood. He grants life and He destroys. He pre destines and He ordains affairs. He controls all things created by him whe ther minute or very great, and they all ascend to Him. Not an atom moves but with His permission, and not a leaf falls down but with His knowledge. He is self-sufficient and can dispense with all things. All others are in need of Him. None can achieve a jot of good nor aught else but by His generosity and His mercy, and likewise none will meet with the slightest hurt or other evil but by His justice and His wisdom. He is omnipresent and all-seeing. He is present in all things created for a purpose through the medium of His power and His knowledge. He is not from a thing, nor He is in a thing and neither He is on a thing. If He was from a thing He would be a creature and if He were in a thing He would be encompassed, and if He were upon a thing He would have been felt as a burden. And all He has created are made out of a thing, and are in things and are upon things. He is far from being capable of being described by a thing, or of being made to change into a thing, Qr .pf becoming the likeness of anything, or of becoming the partner of any thing^ or of being in need of anything, or of entering into a dispute with anything. There is nothing resembling Him, and He is all-hearing and he is omniscient. And whatever strikes the minds of his creatures God is iust the contrary of the same.

I have the honour to acknowledge your No. 278-S, I have ^e ^oeu- ment sent therewith with great interest. It is so 'u&lt;te and .^' rd have no hesitation in venturing the opinion that t e i ocu disclaim from Bin Saud, or at least it is so devised that ^ cou d w^th ^se toclaun knowledge of it. On the other hand it fits in so we , • i ' i .h'»iT'. &amp; I believe he would have attacked the Hedjaz on g wal it to loseas His Majesty's Government had for a long time been telling him that his differences with Hussain and Trans-Jordania were under consideration, and he most do nothing to upset the prospects of Government making peace between them. He feared that any action taken by him against Hussain at such a time would cause His Majesty's GovernmeDt to support the latter. When Hussain at first declined to send his son to the Conference Bin Sand was delighted, as it gave him an opportunity to put him in the wrong with His Majesty's Government, which he took full advantage of. I do not personally think he intended a peaceful solution to be arrived at in the Kuwait Conference but sent his delegation in order that no suspicion should rest on him of wishing to defeat its object. He has stated sufficiently plainly since, that his enemies spoilt the Conference while he ardently desired a peace ful solution of the difficulties. He was forced to put himself in the wron? in not sending his son, when subsequently Hussain agreed to send Amir Zaid, for had he sent him and had the discussions been confined to only the two of tbem, it would have been extremely difficult for him to avoid making peace without exposing his hand, and I believe, he wanted the Conference to fail, in such a manner that he could put the blame on the others to act as an excuse for his future actions. On top of all this has come Hussain's assump tion of the Khalifate; which has been the last straw. I believe that hostilities would have broken out before this but that the season is wrong for movements of the Akhwan. They must wait till next autumn rains provide grazing in the desert. Meanwhile I believe Bin Sand is laying his plans, firstly to stir up trouble as far as possible among mal contents in the Hedjaz and Trans-Jordania (in which connection please see my 122/1/3, Enclo. 2 of Serial No. (267)), and secondly so to arrange matters that he can escape personal responsibility. To this end he is making much of his inability to restrain his subjects who have ' so long suffered at the hands of the Sharifian family ' while Hussain's assumption of the Khalifate affords him an excellent means of rousing the ardour of the Akhwan, whose fanaticism has recently been declining. I am inclined to believe that this is where the document under consider- ation comes in. Generally, documents sent in by some unofficial route, are aimed against the Sultan, but this one would be so much to his liking that there seems no reason why it should be got up and sent in behind his back. n e o er nand, he could hardly, without being accused of causing the trouble, write in direct, and under his own name, demanding that we denrive us enemies of assistance and stating that he is making preparation for war. If , Were , t0 1 aSk . hlm i f the document came from him. he would at tW w L'k k ° owI ^g e of it. but say that it was definite proof of the fact anrl thaf S Cou 1 f ??. restrained and were clamouring for war, Hon.,Iff ,L W f S M dlng tl f m ba&lt;!k ' the y had felt forced to get up this DesZktiP I t0 force his hand.

S tate for the C olonies, N o . 26/387 -S., dated the 6 th J uly 1924. Proposed visit of Royal Air Force aeroplanes to Nejd. I have the honour to refer lo your despatch of the 16th May 1924. regarding (1) Colonel Trevor's proposal that when Royal Air Force Aeroplanes next visited Bahrain they should make from that base a demonstration flight over Riyadh, and (2) Sir John Salmond's proposal that a Mission, representing the High Commission for Iraq, this Residency, the Air Force and the Iraq Government, should pay a visit, entirely friendly and complimentary, by air in the early summer of 1924 to Ibn Saud at Riyadh., Your despatch reached me on the 11th June, and the Flight of aeroplanes had arrived in Bahrain on the 8th June. The dangerous season of Shimals (North-Westerly winds) had set in. It was obviously impossible for the Flight to attempt a visit to Nejd this summer. I therefore deferred replying to you until after I had consulted Major Daly, the Political Agent in Bahrain. I submit the following observations. 5A demonstration flight to Riyadh and back, from Bahrain, without land ing is believed to be out of the question. If Ibn Saud were asked at the present time to receive the friendly visit of a Mission anywhere west of Hasa he would excuse himself on various grounds. He would recognise the moral effect of such a visit upon his own subjects, as he encourages his Bedouin to believe not only that he is invincible but also that he is immune from attacks and reprisals. The Sultan's practice of late years has been to spend a few months of the cold weather in Hasa. We think that a visit to Hofuf next autumn might be suggested. If he agrees, the visit would be comparatively simple matter. During the visit it would be convenient to expatiate on the ease with which he could be visited in Riyadh. Even if an invitation to proceed there does not follow, the fact that the suggestion was made will not be lost on him. Should he refuse to receive a Mission in Hasa, it could be suggested to him that perhaps it would be more convenient for him to receive the visit in Riyadh or elsewhere in the interior !.2 It is quite possible that the Sultan, who has heard by now of Shaikh Hamad of Bahrain's flight in a plane, may agree to the proposed visit to Hasa, and that after the Flight's arrival there he may extend his invitation and even accept the offer of a passage to Riyadh. I agree that most beneficial results should follow from such a visit, With regard to the proposed composition of the Mission, I think that one senior Political Officer should suffice. It is not very material whether he belongs to Iraq or the Gulf, though before starting he should have inter views with the heads of both Administrations, t)l6 ^ 1: 11 ■ vinted 1924.

The Budget is a very conservative one, because with only one year's reliable figures to work on, it seemed desirable that no risks of an adverse balance arising, should be taken. 2. Receipts are accordingly throughout, estimated at from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, below the actuals for last year and below 7 the average (where known) for the last three years. 3. Under expenditure ample allowance has been made in every Depart ment both for actual present expenditure and for certain slight expansion which will be necessary in certain Departments. 4. Item Feceipts ' Contributions by Municipalities towards cost of Police' and Expenditure 'Upkeep of State police.' , At present a police force exists in Manameh paid by the Municipality and costing Rs. 2,000 per mensem. The Ruler proposes to start a State police force properly clothed and rationed and enrolled for a term of years to enable the men to be better trained—the difficulty at present is that the terms are not good enough to attract men of good character to enrol for a long period and men are constant- Iv enrolled and resign after a month or so before they can learn to be efficient. Under the proposed 0 sys tem the Officev Commanding Levies will he in adminis- trative charge of the police as regards clothing, rations and pay, but will not be responsible for the actual police work, for which two Superintendents ot police (one for Manameh and one for Muharraq) will be in charge, under the orders of the local Government who issue executive orders after consultation with Municipal councils concerned. The po'ice will be added to the Levy strength, but will be slightly better paid, the duties being more arduous. Picked men from the Levies will be appointed as pol ce. 01 pine y po ice offences, such as slackness on duty and lack of discipline they will be under the orders ot the Officer Commanding Levies, who besides usual pumshmen . can revert police to Levy duty if found unsuitable. The Officer Co— dmg Levies will not however have anything to do with the police su _ ;' detection and prevention of crime, it being undesirable that he should oe in any way brought into conflict w r ith the inhabitants. A Municipality will be formed in Muharraq during the year and will contribute Rs. 1,000 per mensem towards the police. Rs. 5 l&lt; ; 15 0 3,73,800 6,000 5,7 60 10,500 20,000 25,000 2,46,3105. Item .Z?., Expenditure. —The State at present contributes Es. 4,000 monthly towards Manameh Municipality—against this certain extra landing taxes on goods are credited to the State. The State also contributes Es. 450 per mensem at present towards sanitation in Muharraq—the Ruler proposes to si art a properly organised Municipality in Muharraq, towards which, the State will contribute* Es. 1,000 monthly instead of the sum hitherto paid. Eeceipts from Municipal taxes will be on the same lines as already collected in Manameh. 6 Item K., Expenditure. —The State at present contributes Es. 1,000 monthly to a school, which is very badly managed and has few pupils. The Euler proposes to take over the management of this school (it is normally a State school but has been entirely managed hitherto by a small party without State supervision), and to form two other schools. There will be one elementary school in Manameh and one in Muharraq and a more advanced school in Manameh. Contribution to each elementary school Es. 1,000 and to the higher school Es. 2,000 per mensem. Pending the formation of the schools the balance of Es. 8,000 per mensem will accumulate towards initial expenses of equipment. The Euler requests, in this connection, the assistance of His Majesty's Govt, and would be glad, if Government of proves, if an educational officer, with experience of an Arab country could be lent, on deputation, to advise and start the schools, and thereafter to pay, say, two short annual visits to conduct examinations and report on the schools. A separate letter on the subject will be* submitted. Item E., Expenditure. — Since the introduction of reforms and the forma tion of the Bahrain Court a number of cases has arisen in which it was found that Shaik Esa had, in late years, sold plots of land twice over, or sold land belonging to others without their knowledge. The only fair settlement in a number of cases has been for the State to compensate one of the parties. The Deputy Euler has settled a number of such cases during the last year. It is considered probable thnt in connection with the land settlemeit and record of rights a number of fresh cases may come to light and it has been thougLt prudent to allow a sum for such purposes. The property involved in generally not of great value. Item P., Expenditure. —A system has been envoived whereby the Euler can accurately control expenditure under certain miscellaBeous heads and keep within budget limits. This was not possible during the past year as expenditure could not be accurately gauged, but experience has now made it possible to allocate a sufficient sum under each beading O - X1-408(37) L etter from the H on'ble L ieutenant- C olonel F.

I have the honour to enclose herewith for the information of the Govern- jnent of India, a ccpy of the memorandum cited below from the Political Agent, Bahrain, covering a translation of the Bahrain State Budget for the Arabic year commencing 1st Mubaram 1348 (3rd August 1924). 2. The present Budget being the first of its kind as far as the Bahrain State is concerned, it is not possible to draw any comparison with those of former years. A. rough budget for one month was submitted to the Go\em inent of India by my predecessor under cover of his despatch No. 716-S., dated the 22nd December 1923 (Serial No. 2e0 in File No 480.X. of 19^3, Nos. 1— 303) which gave an indication of the pleasingly solvent condition of the State finances, due mainly to the expert handling of the Customs Depaitment y Mr. Bower 3 The Budget now presented shows a marked advance in almost every direction, and at the same time the estimated balance at the close ot the year 134,3 is greater proportionately than the estimated surplus tor one month last December. 4 'With reference to this anticipated surplus ot Es. 2,46,310 I understand that a revised Budget estimate will probably be submitted later on proposing an increase of expenditure on the Water Supply Scheme and the Electric Power Scheme. 5 I venture to think that Major Daly deserves credit for an ambitious and comprehensive Budget, and i trust that the Government of India will agree that from the enclosed figures the State finances appear to have been established on a thoroughly sound footing.
