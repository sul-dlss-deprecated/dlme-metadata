According to our information B.O.A.C. flying boat could not do reconnaissance to Aden because (a) . There are no intermediate moorings, (b) . Approaching monsoon makes intermediate landing and refuelling impossible, 2. Since long range flying boat is not available nor B O.A.C. land planes, there is no alternate but to use C 2 for reconnaissance. Reconnaissance essential before monsoo n break in any case to ensure possibility of alternate route should that through Iraq be cut. If that should happen this year range flying boat could be used on Khartoum-Aden route. 3. All arrangements for reconnaissance flight made. Brancker of B.O.A.C. and Persian Gulf are accompan- ying flight. We are informed B.O.A.C. are sending from Khortoum to Aden to meet reconnaissance flight. We therefore propose to carry leaving Karachi May 29th. We trust that in the light of above explanation your object ions will be withdrawn.Telegram Prom Department To Secretary of State for India.

We are considering the possibility of Royal Indian Havy reconnaissance of Masirah which it appears might be possible during nonsoon. If Masirah proves accessible by sea during monsoon and adequate landing ground can be established this will facilitate the transportation of equipment and supplies. Salalah must be equipped and supplied by air. Riyan might be accessible by sea from Aden otherwise it must be equipped and supplied by air from Aden. 6.

In view of the possibility of the air link through Iraq, Palestine and Egypt being permanently interrupted, it was decided to make a trial run over the Karachi - Muscat -uden route to ascertain whether it was practicable to operate this route at short notice with civil aircraft.The provisional programme shown in Appendix I provided for two round trips, but from the experience gained on the first trip '•a it was decided that//second one following immediately on top of the first would be redundant. No difficulty was experienced in main taining the schedules laid down, for although it was at times Lecessary to stay longer on the ground this was counterbalanced by, in some cases, faster voyages. Three days were ultimately spent in Aden instead of the one originally.allowed, to enable contact to be made with the B. 0 .A. C, flying, boat which came over from Khartoum. Apart from this very necessary contact, time was not wasted as it enabled us to have further valuable discussions with officials at Aden. MUR AT TVS OF FLIGHT . . ,jr • .... . ' .'. ‘The flight was routed via Jiwani;,. Muscat, Salalah (near ■Merbat) and Riyan (near Mukulla). It commenced on the 29th ■May when the aircraft left Karachi at 0050 G-.M.T. After a call at Jiwani for fuel, Muscat was reached without incident. In the afternoon a formal visit was made to the Sultan of Muscat. On the following morning departure took place on schedule • • t • and an uneventful flight was made to Salalah, the first stop. ■A Blenheim from the Men Command had been sent to meet the flight at this place and the officer in charge had made the necessary arrangements for refuelling. After refuelling, the two aircraft proceeded in company to Riyan which was reached on schedule. After again refuelling, the two aircraft proceeded in company to Aden, which was reached on schedule. The next three days were spent in discussions with various i officials and with the crew of the B.O.A.C. flying boat which arrived in the afternoon of June the 2nd. The aircraft left Aden at 0250 Gr.M.T. on June the 3rd. Sufficient petrol was carried to make Salalah nonstop and Riyan wag accordingly omitted. At balalah the Governor (Mali) of the Salalah District met us at the aerodrome and showed great interest both in the aircraft and in the possibilities of a regular....•••-3- regular service through his place. After leaving Aalalahi?^- again had an uneventful flight to Muscat, Qh both the outwarj and inward trips the various intermediate landing grounds and possible alighting areas for flying boats were-Inspected from the air. On the following day the flight from Muscat to Karachi?; Jiwani was completed according to Schedule. OFFICIALS MET. Aden; H.E.

The wir Ministry Route Book (A.P.1541/5), Vol.II, BookS describes .the route fairly adequately and there is not a grea deal to add to this. • ‘ ■ ■«- .&gt;'' j Riyan is the only landing ground which is not listed in this book. It is situated in Lat.l4 P 40* JJ, Long.49° 20* S. about 12 miles ..west of the emergency landing ground at Shihr, This ^andirg^ground has an all weather runway 860 yds. in length, which is being extended to 1,000 yds.

This has several advantages. It enables a reasonable height to be gained before, crossing the sea and reduce the actual Lea crossing considerably while only adding 14 miles to the total trip. In clear weather there should be no difficulty in picking up Muscat. In hazy weather a-useful pointer is that southend east of Muscat the hills'come, right down to the sea, while immediately west of Muscat a coastal plain-.commences which becomes broader the further west you go. From Muscat to Ras-al-Hadd the coast is steep-to the whole way with the exception of occasional wadis and sandy coves. From Ras-al-Hadd to Aden no difficulty was experienced at any stage in plotting the aircraft’s position by study of the appropriate Lupe and charts. Caution should however be exercised between Ras [ Manta jib, 20 miles west of Shuwamiya, and Merbat. Although the hills on the coast itself are shown on the map as not exceeding 1,000 ft. s several were observed which appeared to be at least 2,000 ft. 2. Route stages. The route may be divided into four stages: (1) Karachi-Jiwani-Muscat 590 miles ( 2 ) Muscat -Sal alah -650 (3) Salalah-Riyan 560 (4) Riyan-Aden 520 Stages (3) and'(4) require little comment. They are of convenient length and the landing grounds, with possible minor improvements, satisfactory. Both °alalah and Riyan have alternative landing grounds in the vicinity which could be used in emergency in the former case at Merbat 35^ East of Salalah and in the latter / at Fuwa, 30°¥est of Riyan. W/T and met. are dealt with separately. . Stages (1) and (2) need considerable improvement. In the first place Muscat is not really suitable for regular operation by modern aircraft and an alternative should be found. In addition a call at this place lengthens the route unnecessarily. In the second place the stage ?Iuscat-balalah is too long and, apart from unbalancing the route, reduces the pay load and in o , • the case of very adverse winds does not allow a great^reserve-5- T) of petrol. The ase-^of Shuwamiya would reduce this stage to . i • i I could 530 miles but this place is in an isolated position and would [ .have a . not be suitable as a regular stop. | ^ This leaves Ris-al-Hadd and Masira Island. Ras-al-Hadd I is well situated on a sand spit with clear approaches and ig • 14 . -i •» i I necessa' already of fairly adequate size although it might well be 1 ^Sched I extended to 1,000 x 1,000. The surface is, however, reported to be soft and may need consolidating. L xn complet Masira is definitely small and with apparently very limij scope for extension. Tt is moreover liable to flood at spring tides. It would appear necessary to seek another site here. This would appear to be well worth while, as the island is ideally situated half way between liwani and Salalah, and furthermore appears to have the makings of an excellent flying boat-base. Summing up, the route can in emergency be operated novni limited loads, and using Muscat, by flying the following stag Karachi ^ ,Muscat Muscat’ &gt; Salalah / ; Salalah - Riyan-Aden 590 miles ~: 650 l. r 680 1920 miles If Ras-al-Hadd can be made usable for D.C;2 aircraft an immediate improvement can be effected by flying Karachi - Ras-al-Hadd 550 miles 7&amp;s-a1-Hadd- S alalah 540 Salalah - Riyan 360 Riyan -.Aden R 320 1770 miles presen' there i connec do it.-6- 5• •••• age to nd would -al-Hadd and is 1 be reported very liai at spring e here, id is and &gt;nt flying ,ted non? ? dng stage 'craft an i ire, the These stages give an almost perfectly balanced route, which ' ’ i .

If operated by D.G.2s j 'fOli ijdftlVG'IC ■ an additional 950 lbs. of useful load can be carried as against either of the first two routes on which full tanks would be necessary • 3 T Schedules^ / If operated via Muscat, the westbound flight could be completed in one day, provided adequate refuelling facilities are set up and an early enough start is made from Karachi. Eastbound would not be so simple owing to the loss of daylight &amp;nd 1 would recommend a night stop at Muscot. These schedules would enable an arrival to be made at Salalah round about mid~day in. both directions when, according to local reports, the weather is at its best. If operating via Ras-al-Hadd or Masira, it would be necessary to make a one day schedule in both directions owing to the total absence of accommodation at these places, although a night stop at Jiwani might be considered. A tentative schedule of operations is shown in Appendix II. 4. Connection to Kha rtoum., The B.O.A.C. flying boat commanded by Capt.Alcock came from Khartoum via Port Sudan. The return flight was being-made via Massawa and Kamaran. Capt.Pelly accompanied the flight to investigate the possibilities of a landplane service but it does not appear likely that the B.O.A.C. will have any land aircraft to. spare. There is no difficulty in operaoing flying boats at i : J. .-f . . Aden and Capt.Alcock will presumably oe rendering a report on the suitability of intermediate alighting areas. I was unable to get any definite information as to the present position at Asmara but the impression I gathered was there would be no great difficulty in operating a landplane connection Aden-Asmara-Khartoum if aircraft were available to do it.5, Aden. There is -a.completely equipped aerodrome at Sheikh . ubich is notJat present in use. It is of ample size, workshop are available and accomodation could be provided nere for gr„ chan ne staff, aircraft crews and transit passengers. As accommodatiJshagha in Aden itself is extremely bad, this is an important point, ihanrte is understood that the Air Officer Oommnding, Royal Air Force In dian Aden, would have no objection to the use of this aerodrome, bad i y subject of course to the proviso that we should have to clear easy t out if an emergency arose and the aerodrome was required for . NaV al this t Service purposes. II- If we do start civil operations to *den, it is strongly recommended that this procedure be adopted. Accommodation a:te am facilities at Khormaksar are in any case limited and it woultyear, be very much more convenient for every one concerned ..if cin shelte operations were kept entirely separate. B.O.A.C. would also Take-( accommodate their staff at Sheikh Othman, whether they opera-out ir the connecting link with flying boats or landplanes. 8^ fi.Tanding grounds.

Enquiries from the y ali of ^alalah -elicited the following facts.. The amount and frequency of this low cloud n alighting depends entirely on the monsoon. In some monsoons there is reat detail practically none and in others it may be almost a daily d be used| occurrence. The clouds were reported to be at times as low is report# as the tops of the pD^m trees. / It was however stated that o gge othe.'J these conditions usually prevailed in the early-morning and ‘ough IJatr^ the afternoon and that in most cases the weather cleared base woul: for several hours round about mid-day. The ali stated ( ar operati (Although I do not know on what authority) that these condi- o -fn be : tions.did not extend as far east as Shuwamiya. The general jars tm uc Lying boat! a PP ear &amp;nce of the country bears out this probability. In August 1940 a Blenheim aircraft from Aden, commanded by a most experienced pilot, found it impossible to approachS8.l9.1s.h s,s the clouds i/vere down to within 20 It, of the sea. The aircraft had to return-to Reida, This appears to be the only area where serious-trouble may be expected fror/i weather, apart frotfi the usual sandstorms, but meteorological knowledge of this coast is very sparse. 9. T/T. A separate report on the wireless operation during this flight is being made by Cpl.Isbister. The results were mainly , negative. Recommendations regarding meteorological and W/T facility will be f o,und in Appendix VI. 9 It will be appreciated from the foregoing notes on meteoro logical conditions that W/T communication and a Meteorological Observer are essential at Salalah if regular operations'have to be carried out at this place. 10. Refuelling; arrangements. There should be no difficulty in laying down additional stocks at Muscat if necessary and I should imagine that stocks 'h' Vi;. could be laid down at Ras-al-Hadd and ! 'ihsira. At Salalah and i Riyan it will be most difficult to replenish stocks until after the monsoon, although in an emergency this' might possibly be don At Salalah, for example, the Governor stated that he thought petrol could be landed at Res Risut but he was not very happy about the prospect. The Air Officer Commanding, Aden, provi sionally agreed that we might draw on their stocks up to 8,000 gallons at Salalah and 5,000 gallons at Riyan.* It must however be borne in mind that a very considerable wastage from evaporati is taking place from these stocks. At Aden and Karachi, the on; two places where petrol was metered, my consumption* worked ouiA 65 gallons per hour.

Both His Excellency the Governor of Men and His Highness the Sultan of Muscat evinced the greatest interest in the possibility of regular civil operations along this route and no difficulty is anticipated in this connection. It is of course possible that, if Muscat itself were omitted and replaced by Ras-al-Hadd or Masira, the Sultan of Muscat might not be so keen, but I do not think he would put any obstacles in the way, ‘ No difficulties from the local inhabitants appear likely at Riyan, which is close to Mukulla, the second largest town in Men D rotectorate, where there is a British Resident Adviser,. * Nor does there appear to be any likelihood of trouble at Salalah, which is under the control of a responsible Governor, answerable to the Sultan of Muscat,. At Masira and Ras-al-Hadd a small guard may be desirable as these are out of the way places with little direct control,. I understand from Mr.Hickinbotham that the difficulty is not so likely to* be with the actual inhabitants as with other tribes who, if they knew that regular operations were taking place and storeo held at these places, might possibly be tempted to loot them, Particularly if'they thought they had a grudge against the Sultan, in which case they might do so in the hopes, of making trouble for him. Mr,Hickinbotham suggested that if survey parties are sent either of these two places it would be a gooa thing if he ac companied them on the initial visit. ^O IMODAT TO M ON the route, Tbifeis ‘mainly^covered by the 'route handbook. Buildings ^hl be. «ne,QQq^ary at Ras-alMadd and/or Masira if W/i etc, is installed- 11 - installed, but as we did not land at either of these places it is difficult to make concrete suggestions. It is understoo] that labour would have to be imported from Muscat. At Salalah accommodetion is available in the town, but ^PPKHDICS The jtnd T place detc it will be better to build about half way between tne landing ground and the town, and provide accommodation for twoJ£irelej Operators, one Meteorological Observer, and a dormitory for, saV) oen persons, with kitchen, bath-house, etc. Local autncr ies state that such a building, could be erected within three t four weeks,-as-the stone and building material is available ot the spot. We understand that orders for such work should be j placed through the Tfe.li. A petrol store should also be built at the landing grouJ so that stocks of petrol can be kept there rather than in thel town itself. At any of the aerodromes mentioned in this report petr stores should be built at the landing ground where they do m already exist. CONCLUSION:. •. Thanks to the-arrangements made by the Political iigenti Muscat, and by the Aden Command at Salalah and Riyan, the flight proceeded without a hitch. It was particularly helpf of the Aden Command to send out an aircraft to Salalah to nef us, as there would otherwise have been very considerable dei in obtaining fuel there and at Riyan. In addition the local .un ! '. TV. knowledge of the pilot of the Blenheim was most helpful. In Aden both the civil Government officials and the Bo; . g: , Air Force officers at Air Headquarters were most helpful and co-operative, while at the R.A.F. station at Kh.ormaksar the Station Commander and his officers afforded us every facilWl and gave us much valuable information. « . t Mr.Hickinbotham’s assistance in Muscat territory was : the greatest value.

Line to be continued in a north-wester!? direction to a point where the. dark s&amp;nS in the river bed meets the ligjit sand at the base of the foothills. From this • ' ■ point the line should be extended north wards towards the Fort as far as possibl; Aerodrome is situated in a valley. It is closed in at the southern end and the ground slopes from south to north. Take off in a southerly direction with D.C.2 or similar types of aircraft is no 1 considered safe at full load, although i: is understood that southerly winds are r frequent this side,, but it must be faced that should they occur it would be necessary to delay departures. It should, however, be possible to take off from south to north with a tail wind of 5 to 10.miles an.hour, as it is possible in this direction to follow a narrow valley out to seaward. Take-offs were made in both directions, and Yihen taking off towards the south, although conditions were calm, it was necessary to run the engines at 30 to 35 manifold pressure to clear the hills, and this was only just. achieved. If down draught had been experienced it is most unlikely that the aircraft would have cleared them. . . ; RAS-AL-HAD: ' w .o J. uxcai ajjpi-uciuiiaa ' room i or. extensi on.

About three miles south-southeast there is a large flat area which, from the ai^ is suitable for landing. It is recommend ed that the possibility of an alterna tive site be investigated, as this place being half way between Jiwani and Salalah would present an ideal stage for medium wave aircraft. This is important as an emergency landing ground if Salalah should be shut in by low cloud. Inspected from a low altitude the surface appeared fairly good and capable of extension to s eaward. The area is sufficient, but the north west portion is rough and the aerodrome generally requires levelling and clear ing of large stones. There is no wind indicator and one should be installed.

L&amp;'leafield with represent.ativea of Air Headquarters, British Overseas Airways Corporation and Tataa in May. A recommended &amp;£ia organisation for the route was detailed. Copies of the report were sent to and all Political authorities and Air Force Comnands concerned. The British Overseas Airways Corpora A ion have planned a certain amount of the organisation required, but no action lias been taken pending instructions from who have now stated that India ia responsible for the organisation of the route. In view of other coamuni- cationa concerning the responsibility of the A.0.C.-in-C# India thi a is interpreted to mean the eastern end of the route i.e. upto the Muscat-Hadramaut boundary. The survey was carried out in order to find all alternative route for the Empire Air Services in the event of the Iraq route being interrupted. The route is unsuitable for seaplanes except for a part of the year and it was intended, in emergency to use the Government of India D-C.S’s to operate the services. These may no longer be available. The problem now is to organise the landplane route ready for emergency. The following political, financial and executive arrangements are for decision and action 1. Operation of the route .

Since Air Headquarters and the Military Engineerir^g organisation cannot undertake the work and the C.P.’if.D. are also hard pressed, there is only one remaining alternative. It was decided that the D.C.A. will have to carry out the work Department;ally. An additional Engineer Officer will be required arid one Er^ineer Officer will be nipuxsdx&amp;nGhuMC sent to Muscat to ♦ake charge .Skilled labour will have to be sent from India, but cooly labour should be recruited locally. It is hoped to recruit a Sub- Divisional Officer from the Muscat Engineering Service. External Affairs Department will make enquiries as to ■♦•he availability of a uch an officer and the availability of local cooly labour at Muscat, Ras-ul-Hadd, Masirah and Salalah* Raa^lH^ dd. Import of material and some skilled labour will be required for the construction of the runways. External Affairs Department, will ascertain what local transport (presumably Dhows) is available. Masjrah« The first necessity is to survey the site for a new land- im ground and the Masirah inner channel to determine whether a ship could be anchored there as a base. It is hoped that the B.O.A.C. yacht Imperia will be available both for the survey and to be permanently stationed at Masirah. The D.C.A. will take this up with tne B.O.A.C. Similar problems of import of labour and material and the recruitment, of local labour arise at Masirah as at Ras-ul- Hadd, but if the use of the yacht Imperia as a permanent base proves feasible then the problem is of the same order as the o$e at Ras-ul-Hadd. If this is not feasible, a larger organisation including buildings will be required. ^alalah.

Ihe P. &amp; f. Department have a medium wave station at forsrhire which is at present maintained as a reserve. They could also pro duce short wave apparatus. This solution should only be adopted in emergency. The communications from the B.O.A.C. suggest that the Air Ministry have certain apparatus earmaiked for this route • An t enquiry is to be made by the Director of Civil Aviation in India. 9. Meteorology. It was decided that in the initial stage of organisation we should rely on current weather observations by the B.cTa.C. personnel. The D.G.O. will be asked to assist with such apparatuses is required and when operations become established on the route, it will be necessary to provide a pilot balloon observatory at Salalah and special meteorolaical personnel will then be required.

A meetine; was held in Finlay House on October 5th at vhich a programme for organizing the Southern Arabian Route was discussed. Those attending were :- Sir Frederick Tymms, Director of Civil aviation, Mr. J.W.S. Brancker, Regional Director, In^ia Sc Burma, British Airways, Mr. M. 3tuart-3haw, Operations Superintendent, India &amp; Burma, British Airways, Mr. C.Aaams, British Airways. 1. RESPONSIBILITY. The D.C.A. pointed out that the U.K. Government were responsible for laying down the organization whether the route was regarded as a Royal Air Force Route or a civil one. The U.L.Govt. had, however, asked the Govt, of India to develop the route ana the D.C.A. proposed to deal with the sector Karachi/Salsdah inclusive. He pointed out also that the communication received from U.K. was by no means clear and that ii xresh instructions were received, it aight be necessary to alter the procedure. 2 . ORGANIZATION. British Airways put forward their requirements xor immediate and future operations and the facilitie ^agreed to in principal were as follows:- (A) - MUSCAT .- (i) - Aerodrome - The aerodrome was not on the regular route but it was considered essential as an emergency landing ground and might be more important if both Ras- el-Hadd and Masira proved unsatisfactory. Whatever improvements were made to the sun ace ana c~ ti. ~ landing ground, it was agreed that it would not be suitable for the regular operation of modern types of aircraft2 - i^o) efi owing to the difficult approaches. The D.C.A. said that he would arrange with the Political Agent, Muscat, for the improvements recommended in the Survey Report to be put in hand immediately. (ii) - Wireless - The D.C.A. stated that the R.A.F. wireless station was being removed from Muscat but that he would enquire into the possibilities of using the installation operated by Messrs. Cables &amp; Wireless. (iii) - Meteorology - There was already a Class III station in operation and the D.C.A. agreed that he would see whether the organization could be improved and if upper wind reports could be provided. (B) “ RAS—1L—HADD - (i) - Aerodrome - The landing ground at present was un usable by modern types of aircraft and, before any concrete recommendation could be made, it was essential lor a detailed ground inspection to be carried out. The size recommended by the D.C.A. and agreed to by B.O.A.C. was 1400 yards and it was proposed to construct two runways of this length should this be a practicable proposition. The D.C.A. did not consider that the bitumastic process would be satisfactory owing to the excessive salt deposit. Stone runways could probably be constructed buVthis would depend on local supplies oi material. if survey showed that Masira was impossible, it was agreed that short and meaium wave wireless should be iiBtailed at Ras-el-Hadd instead. (iii) - Meteorology - Providea that upper wind reports were available from Salalah, it was not considered essential to provide other than local observations from Ras-el-Hadd ana then only if it was to be usea regularly instead of Masira The 0.3., I.R., considered that in the initial stages ouch reports could, if necessary, be supplied by Bntisn Air ways* Wireless Operators Civ) - Buildings -/•••••D AT (V i tz) &gt; -a ) 111 ) &gt; t t ■ (a f - 3 - HV (iv) - Bui lairds - in the event of Ras-el- Hadd being chosen as a regular stop instead of Masira, certain buildings would have to be constructed j- (a) Quarters for Radio personnel consisting of two Europeans ana one Indian. (b) Rest House accommodation for 20 people for an emergency nightstop. It was agreed that this should be constructed ’in the form of dormitories. (c) iiccomodation for housing a racdo ana generating plant. (d) Two spare quarters for Indian staff. (e) Store building for technical and victualling requirements. (f) Necessary servants* quarters. (g) General barracks for guard. (h) Water supply. (i) Petrol store. A petrol store of some kind would be required in any case. If Ras-el-Hadd was to be used regularly, this would have to be large enough* to house approximately 50,000 gallons of luel, but if Ras-el-Hadd was to be used for emergency purposes only, the store should be large enough to house approximately 5,000 gallons. Details of the sizes ana types of ouilaings would be worked out by Messrs. Campbell &amp; Adams. Here, as elsewhere, the necessity or desirability of constructing buildings in a Fort should be aiscussed with local authorities. (C) - MASIRjt - It was agreed that from a geographical point of view, Masira would best fulfil requirements and that every endeavour should be made to develop it. (i) - Aerodrome - It was thought that the enlargement and consolidation of the existing aerodrome would be impracticable and it was agreed that the new site reCommendea/.•••recommended in the original survey report should be reconnoitred* Runwpys 1400 yards long were extremely desirable. - Wireless - Short and medium wave wireless was necessary and the only equipment apparently available for this route was s- (a) The Indian Posts &amp; Telegraphs Departments medium wave station from Peshawar, supplemented by short wave apparatus; and (b) Marconi AD/57/48 MV and SW transmitter receiver and a T 19 medium wave transmitter and R 1084 Receiver held by British Airways. The latter equipment w as ready and it was proposed to install it at Salalah. As, however, the former equipment was thought to be the most power ful, it was proposed to substitute it at Salalah later. The R.D., I.B., thought that whilst British Airways could supply the immediate W/T needs at Salalah, it might not be possible for this equipment to be tranS' ferred to another southern Arabian station when it had been replaced by the apparatus belonging to the Posts ana Telegraphs Department. He pointed out that British Airways might have other urgent commitments elsewhere and the fact that British Airways were able to equip Salalah immediately did not mean that they had any surplus wireless gear; on the contrary it had been necessary to deplete other stations as it was felt that it was extremely important to install a wireless station at Salalah without delay in order to make the route possible should unforeseen circumstances arise. The D.C.A. pointed out that the same applieu with even greater force to -/the Posts and Telegraphs station under discussion. The Government of India Aviation organization had no responsibility for this/■this route and the apparatus could only be made available if the Govt, of India agreed that they had no prior war need anu tnen only on condition that it was replaced by H.M.G* without undue delay. (iiiJ - I n the initial stages it was thought that only local observations would be necessaryj provided upper wind reports were available from Salalah. The Operations Superin tendent confirmed that British airways* wireless operators could supply these observations, if required. (iv) - Buildings - If Masira was to be the regular stopping point, buildings of the same kind as those suggested for Bas- el-Hadd would be required. Lack of local resources might necessitate the use of prefabricated buildings constructed in Karachi and shipped from there by dhow. It would be necessary to provide *- (1) Accommodation for radio staff, consisting of two Europeans and one Indian. (2) Emergency nightstop accommodation for 20 people which mi^it be constructed in the form of dormitories. (3) Accommodation for wireless equipment and generating plant. (4) Two spare quarters for Indian personnel. (5) Store building for technical and victualling requirements. (6) Barracks for Levies. (7) Necessary servants* quarters (8) Petrol store (9) A proper water supply. If Ras-el-Hadd was to be the regular poino of call, building requirements would be reduced, but a petrol store would be required if it was found possible to construct a suitable emergency aerodrome. Here again the detailed designs of the buildings would be worked out by Messrs. Adams and Campbell. ( D &gt; - SaLALAH - (i) - Aerodrome - Reports showed that apart from simple grading operations, the aerodrome required little developmert (ii) - Wireless/ ....(ii) - Wireless - The D *G-A. pointed out that as Salalah was the Key station on the whole route, it should be equipped with the more powerful Posts and Telegraphs wireless equipment. As an immediate measure he thought that the equipment held by British Airways would be sufficient. Provided that authority could be obtained, tne rosts and Telegraphs Department would arrange to dismantle and send to Salalah their apparatus from Peshawar and it could operate there until replaced by equipment supplied by H«MeG# When the Posts and Tele- graphs equipment arrived at Salalah, the British Airways- apparatus would be available for equipping Masira* “ Meteorology - The Operations Superintendent felt that it was necessary that a first order station be installed at Salalah as upper wind reports and forcasts were important, especially as Salalah was a potential nightstop. i.he D*C*A« agreed to take the matter up with the Meteorological department with a view to obtaining the necessary equipment and staff. “ Buildings - It was not absolutely certain v;hat buildings would be required as accommodation for certain staff might be already available in the town. Certain buildings would be required immediately in order to accommodate the wireless equipment being sent to Salalah by British Airways, but it was agreed that these might be of kutcha construction if this was found desirable by Messrs. Campbell ana Adams and that more adequate buildirgs coula be planned. It might be necessary for certain structural material to be shipped from Karachi. The building requirements would be as follows (1) Accommodation for the wireless station. (2) Accommodation for the Meteorological Observatory. (3) Living/X) irix) v±) - 7 - (3) Living accommodation for station personnel to consist probably of two druopean Radio Operators, two Indian Radio Operators ana two Indian Observers. (4) Two spare quarters for Indian staff. (5) Rest House accommodation of a simple type for 20 people. (6) A petrol store capable of holding 50,000 gallons of fuel. (7) A water tank capable of holding 1000 gallons of water. The exact types and designs of builaings would be aecided by Messrs. Campbell and Adams, taking into consideration the probable grades of imported staff. It was thought also that some quarters might be necessary for servants, depending on the exact situa tion of the cscap. Similarly accommodation for guard might also be required. ifa-gy p These points woula be examined by Messrs. Campbell and Adams who would take action accordingly. (E) - SHWAHIYAH - This point appeared to be the best place for an emergency land ing grouna between Masira and Salalah. However, it required surveying and enlarging, whether this was practicable could only be determined by a survey of the ground and it might be possible to obtain a more suitable site in the vicinity. It would, however, only be requirea for emergency purposes and a petrol store capable of housing 5,000 gallons Oo. fuel would be the only building required.

Those attending were i- Sir Frederick Tymms, Director of Civil aviation, Mr. Brancker, Regional Director, India &amp; Burma, British airways, Mr. M. Stuart-Shaw, Operations Superintendent, India &amp; Burma, British Airways, Mr. C. Adams, British Airways. 1. RESPOHSIBIIITY. The D.C.a. pointed out that the U.K. Government were responsible for laying down the organization whether the route was regarded as a Royal Air Force Route or a civil one. The U.K. Government had, hov^ever, asked the Government of India to develop the route and the D.C.a. proposed to deal with the sector Karachi/Salalah inclusive. He pointed out also that the communication received from U.K. was by no means clear and that if fresh instructions were received, it might be necessary to alter the procedure. 2. CRGaITIZaTIPIT. British Airways put forward their requirements for immediate and future operations and the facilities agreed to in principal were as follows (A) - MUSCaT. - ^ i) „ aerodrome - The Aerodrome was not on the regular route but it was considered essential as an emergency landing ground and might be more important ii both Rasei-Hadd and Masira proved unsatisfactory. Whatever improvements were made to the surface and size of the landing ground, it was agreed that it would not be suitable for the regular- 2 - \M[V regular operation of modern typet of aircraft owing to the difficult approacx.e s. The J.J.n. said that he would arrange with the loliticai ^gent, Muscat, for the improve ments recommended in the Survey .deport to be put in hand immediately. ( ^ ~ tireless — I he stated thc&gt;.t the xi • .5 1 . wireless station was being removed from Muscat out that he would enquire into the possibilities of using the installa tion operated by Messrs. Gables and Wireless. (iii; - Me te pro logy - There v/as already a Class III station in operation and the D. C.a. agreed that he would see whether the organization could be improved and if upper wind reports could be provided. (B) - RaS-BL-HaDD - (i) - aerodrome - The landing ground at present was unusable by modern types of aircraft and, before any concrete recommendation could be made, it was essential for a detailed ground inspection to be carried out. The size recommended by the J.C.-n.. and agreed to by B.O.A.G. was 14C0 pards and it was proposed to construct two run ways of this length should this be a practicable proposition. The D.G.a. did not consider that the bitumastic process would be satisfactory owing to the excessive salt deposit. Stone runways could probably be constructed out this would depend on local supplies of material. _ ,/ireless - If survey showed that Masira was impossible, it was agreed that short and medium wave tire less should be installed at Ras-el-Hadd instead. (iii) - Meteorology - 1-rovided that upper wind reports were available from Salalah, it was not considered essential to provide other than local observations from Ras-el-Hadd and then only if it was to be used regularly instead of Masira.-3- \^l Maaira. Tne C.S., I.B., considered that in the initial stages such reports could, if necessary, be supplied by British Airways* tireless Operators. (iv) - Buildings - In the event of Ras-el-Hadd being chosen as a regular stop instead of Kasira, certain build ings would have to be constructed (a) quarters for Radio personnel consisting of two Europeans and one Indian. (b) Rest House accommodation for 20 people for an emergency nightatop. It was agreed that this should be constructed in the form of dormitories. (c) -accommodation for housing a radio and generating plant. (d) Two spare quarters for Indian staff. (e) Store building for technical and victualling requirements. (f) necessary servants’ quarters. (g) General barracks for guard. (h) water supply. (i) Petrol store. petrol store of some kind would be required in any case. If Ras-el-Hadd was to be used regularly, this would have to be large enough to house approximately 50, OCC gallons of fuel, but if Has—el—Hadd was to be used 101 emeigcnc^ purposes only, the store should be large enough to house approximately 5,GOO gallons. Jetails of the sizes and types of buildings would be worked out by Messrs. Campbell &amp; ^dams. Here, as else where, the necessity or de i. ir»bi li t;y of constructing buildings in a Fort should be discussed with local author! ties. (C) - MAdIR/v - It was agreed that from a geographical point of view Masira would best fulfil requirements and that everp- 4 - every endeavour should be made to develop it. ^ 1 ' ' ^ erodror:je - It was thought that the enlargement and consolidation oi the existing aerodrome would be impracticable and it was agreed that the new site recommen- aea in the oiiginal survey report should be reconnoitred. Runways 1400 yards long were extremely desirable. (it) - tireless - abort and medium wave wireless was necessary and the only equipment apparently available for this route was s- (a) The Indian Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department’s medium wave station from Peshawar, supplemented oy short wave apparatus; and (b) Marconi ^ID/ 57/48 MW and SW transmitter receiver and a T 19 medium v/ave transmitter and R 1084 Receiver held by British airways. The latter equipment was ready and it was proposed to install it at Salalah. as, however, the former equipment was thought to be the most powerful, it was proposed to substitute it at balalah later. The R.D., I.B., thought that whilst British Airways could supply the immediate w/T needs at balalah, it might not be possible for this equipment to be transferred to another southern ^.rabian station when it had been replaced by the apparatus belonging to the Posts and Telegraphs Department. He pointed out that British Airways might have other urgent commitments elsewhere and the fact that British Airways were able to equip Salalah immediately did not mean that they had anp surplus wireless gear;, on the contrary it had been necessary to deplete other stations as it was felt that it was extremely important to install a vviie- less station at Salalah without delay in order to make the route possible should unforeseen circum* 1 pointed out that the stance s arise. The D. '-z. A.-b- \M^ the same applied with even greater force to the Posts and Telegraphs station under discussion. The Government of India Civil Aviation organiza tion had no responsibility for this route and the apparatus could only be made available if the Government of India agreed that they had no prior war need and then only on condition that it was replaced by II.2I.G. without undue delay. (iii) - Meteorology - In the initial stages it was thought that only local observations would be necessary, provided upper wind reports were available from Salalah. The Operations Superintendent confirmed that British Airways * wireless operators could supply these observa tions, if required. ( iv) - Buildings - If Masira was to be the regular stopping point, buildings of the same kind as those suggested for Ras-el-Kadd v^ould be required. Lack of local resources might necessitate Hie use of prefabricated ouildings constructed in Karachi and shipped from there by dhow. It would be necessary to provide i- (1) Accommodation for radio stall, consisting oi two Europeans und one Indian. (2) Emergency nightstop accommodation for 20 people which might be constructed in the torri of dormitories. (3) Accommodation for wireless equipment and generating plant. ( 4 ) Two spare quarters for Indian personnel. (b) Store building for technical and victualling requirements. (6) Barracks for Levies. (7) Necessary servants f quarters. (8) Petrol store. ( 9 ) A proper water supply. If Has-el-Hadd was to be Hie regular point of call, building requirements would oe reduced, but a petrolpetrol -3 to re would be required if it w a 3 found possible to construct a suitable emergency aerodrome* Here again the detailed designs oi the buildings would be worked out by Messrs, -kdams and oaiiipbell* (li) ~ bAhiUjAH — (i) - Aerodrome ~ Heports showed that apart from simple grading operations, the aerodrome required little development• (ii) ' i/irel ess - The I.G.a* pointed out that as Dalai ah »i/as tile xcey station on Hie whole route, it should oe equipped with tne more powerful hosts and Telegraphs wireless equipment. As an immediate measure he thought that the equipment held by British Airways would be suffi cient. Provided that authority could be obtained, the Posts and Telegraphs Department would arrange to dismantle and send to Salalah their apparatus from Peshawar ?jj i d' it could operate there until replaced by equipment supplied oy II.M.G. ,fnen the Posts and Telegraphs equipment arrived at Balaian, the British Airways’ apparatus would be available for equipping Masira. (iii) - Meteorology - The Operations Superintendent felt that it was necessary that a first order station be installed at Salalah as upper wind reports and forecasts were important, especially as Salalah was a potential nigntatop. The D.C.A. agreed to take the matter up with the Meteorological Department with a view to obtaining the necessary equipment and staff* (iv) - Buildings - It was not absolutely certain what buildings would be required as accommodation for certain staff might be already available in the town. Certain buildings would be required iiamediately in order to accommodate the wireless equipment being sent to Salalah by British Airways, out it was agreed that these might oe of Kutcha construction if this was found desirable by-7- \vf! by Messrs*. Gairipbell and Adams and tiiat more adequate buildings could be planned. It might be necessary for certain structural material to be shipped from Karachi. Tne building requirements would be as follows ; - (l) Ac coition at ion for the wireless station. (^) Accommodation for the Meteorological Observatory. (b) Living accommodation for station personnel to consist probably of two European Radio Operators, two Indian Radio Operators and two Indian Observers. (4) Two spare quarters for Indian staff. (b) Rest House accommodation of a simple type for 20 people. (C) A petrol store capable of holding bO,QOQ gallons of fuel. (7) A water tanK capaole of holding 1000 gallons of water . Tne exact types and designs of buildings would be decided by Messrs. Canrpoell and Adams, tidcing into consideration the probable grades of imported staff. It was thought also that some quarters might be necessary for servants, aepending on the exact situation oi the camp* Similarly accommodation i or guard mignt also oe required. These points would be examined oy Messrs. Oampbeil and Adams who would taxe action accordingly* (L) - SHUWhhIYAH - This point appeared to be the best place tor an emergency landing ground between Hasira and Salalah. However, it required surveying and enlarging. Whether this was practicable could only be determined by a survey of the ground and it might be possible to obtain a more suitaole site in the vicinity. It would, however, only be required for emergency purposes and a petrol store capable of nousing b.OOO gallons of fuel would be the only building required.-3- 3RITI3H OViiRSifiAS AIRV/AY3 GORPORATIOH IIOIA AUL BURMA RUG I OK.

This landing ground was inspected from the air, The surface appeared to be soft and camels moving on the area left definite tra The suitability of this surface can obly be determined from a ground inspection It would appear that it may be possible to extend this land ground to approximately 1000 yards in the North West - South East direction and a more probable extension of the North East - South l arm towards the South West.

This is approximately t° scale. It vail be seen that the dimensions differ from those shown in the R.A.i . j.’oute book. Tne main difference being that the dimension given by the i'..A.P . for the northern boundary is 1^00 yards whereas it was found to be approximately 1200 yards. The surface requires a considerable amount of grading and levelling and until this has been done it is recommended that the NeS. strip 200 yards i ide along the eastern boundary should be used for operations, 'itin£ of buildings. The buildings have been sited along the western boundary approximately 300 yards from the southern end of it. A sketch plan s attached which shows the site for the petrol stores, W/T and Meteoroio- gi.cal stations. This site was selected after due consideration and for the following reasons i (1) The prevailing winds vary from S.S.E. - V/.S.W. with occasional- strong winds from N.W. during the winter. These wind's only- last for a few days but carry a certain amount of dust. (2) The only other possible site would be on the eastern boundary but this would increase the distance from the town. The distance to the area selected from the town is 4 miles. The following work has‘been started; 1. Petrol stores 2 C Meteorological and W/T stations On the day of our departure 60 men were working and 30 camels were carrying material to site. It is hoped that one petrol store may be well on the way to completion by the time the tanker arrives at Salalah, 3, Levelling and grading of the aerodrome surface. Building resources. The following materials are available: 1, Building stone. This is a sottish shell conglomerate but suffice ten tly good for building purposes. All buildings at Salalah are constructed from this stone, 2. Lime. A certain amount of lime is available but has to be burnt. • 3..Chandles ? a type of timber pole. 4, Sand', 5. Clay, Labour. Unskilled labour is available, as are masons ana carpenters. The latter two, are not very expert and it may be necessary^ to imp ± both types of artisans later. These may be a vailable i.rom Nuscat. The following is the cost of some items;Stone 18' - 22' x 9' x 6'-20 Dollars per 1000 Labourer ' ■ ' - i Dollar per day Camel driver - 1 Dollar per day Masons -li Dollars per day. A day is from sunrise to sunset. Tools and plant. Not available. H.H. the Sultan has a three ton lorry vii ci is expected to arrive in -Salalah shortly. Tools have to be imported from Karachi and a list is appen of what it is intended to purchase and send by the tanker. Type of biaildine .

Material for anything over 12' span will have tots imported. The tupe of roof described above is used locally and is found to be satisfactory. 5. Paint for wood work to be imported. Water supply . There is no water available within 2 miles of the aerodrome an! the s ite is barren and unfit for people to live at it is propose! to erect the residential quarters on the sea front in the town vie? an ample water supply is available and living conditions are fair, The staff can get to the aerodrome either by cycle or horse, The dormitory will of course have to be built at the aerodrome, This will mean carrying water but as Salalah will only be an eme?: : night stop this should not prove difficult. The site selected for the residential camp is in a coconut giv on the sea front. The land will be made available by H.H. Immediate requirements for living accommodation wi 11 have to - met by tentage. Tents are being shipped on the tanker but a furta marquee is requireq. Mr. Adams is arranging this. A certain This should be amount of tentage is being purchased by shipped at the earliest possible date. Arrangements for executing work.

H.H. nas been most helpful and has given every assistance? within his power. The-services of his State Engineer, who wiUK Salalah for the next six months, have been placed at our dispose the supervision of the building work. It was arranged that the ; would supply all labour and material available locally.

This ? howevei 9 muse be done in Thalers (Dollars) and arrangements have to be made to transport these from Muscat. The value of a thaler js at present a little more than a rupee, I have drawn Rs 7000/- from the Muscat treasury and the Politi cal Agent is arranging to ship Rs 5000/- worth of thalers to Salalah to meet our immediate needs. Tne wali will produce detailed receipts for all payments mcide. The balance of Rs 2000/- has been drav/n to meet customs duty on building materials etc. to be imported. This will be payable in Muscat. This amount is on deposit with the Political Agent who has kindly agreed tc make paymnnt of the duty as and when necessary. H.H.j to expedite our work, has kindly agreed to release a certain amount of building material which he had collected for his own work at Salalah. ^his consists of two kilns of lime, building stone and chandles. This will of course be replaced by us when collected. H„H. has also agreed to allow us the use of his lorry for carrying material when we require it. Petrol will be necessary for this purpose and some is to be shipped from Muscat. • For the transport of personnel, 4 horses are being loaned temporarily by H.H 1 .

The flight was uneventful. The Political Agent was very concerned that he had no official information about our delayed departure from Karachi. The only information received by him was that sent personally by Mr. Adams. Estimates. I have been unable to form any precise idea as to what costs will be but rough figures for the W/T and Meteorological station and the Petrol stores are given: Two petrol stores 64’ x 20 1 = 1280 sq. ft. @ 2.31 dollars per sq. ft. = 2 x 2957 = 5914 dollars. Engine Shed _, 16‘ x 16’ = 256 sq. ft. @ 2.31 dollars per sq, it. = 591 dollars. Radio and Meteorological station 30‘ x 16’ = 480 sq. ft. @ 2.31 dollars per sq. ft. = 1109 dollars.

It was learnt tnat the sultan of Muscat had proceeded to Salalan in tne A.I.O»C. tanker 'Christa' wrfi was hound for Aden and making a special call at Salalah for His Highness. The Sultan is making Salalan his headquarters for six months and tnis move will no doubt he to our benefit.

Apparently, the Sheikh of Burr is the controlling author! and nas offered to help in. every wasy possible. Frftm a political point^of view, the P.A. has asked us to recomnEi the development of Aas-al-Hadd rather than Masira. In £ii] case, before visiting Masira he would prefer to make preliminary negotiations on the island himself since he tnought tha\. the control over the local Sneikh was looser than anywhere else on the coast owing to the maccessabil of the island.

Until regrading is completed it is recommended that landings are made in a line parallel witn and 200 yards distant from the East boundary markings. The D.G.A. nas asked that tne aerodrome he extended to 1 , ; 4C ; 0 yards in one direction hut it is t^e .party’s recommendation that this is not s for the time being necessary, since the approaches to the aerodrome are clear in all directions. The boundary markings require repainting and this is being done with local lime. b) Buildings Local resources . There is ample stone wnicn can be quarried about two miles from the aerodrome. Juss (local cement) is not available . but mutt is used as a substitute. Gnandles are also abundant altnougn imported trniber xor trusses would' be preferable, if it can be obtained in time. Immediate steps nave be.Bn taKen to construct tne two petrol stores and tne w/T station on tne West side of the 'aerodrome on tne, site snown in the-attached plan. This site has been chosen since it is out of the direction of tne prevailing wind and the 70 feet masts are not likely to cause an obstruction under any conditions. .The west'side o± tne aerodrome is also preferred, to the East ^ nearer tne town. ' Work on these three buildings nas already been commenced, tne Sultan Kindly naving stopped work on all nis buildings. He Has also sold us his cut stone and tv.o Kilns oi lime. It is possible that one petrol store may be finished in time for the arrival of tne tanker. Tne State Engineer is controlling tne work but I do not doubt that witnout some constant supervision on tne part of a “Europ.-an, time will cease to mean anything. „Tae wall supplying transport, labour and materials and the prices agreed upon are as follows:-r - Stone - 1000 Mocks - 20 Thalers (Size 22' x 9 X o Labour , .

If it is decided to staff Salalan permanently it will be necessary to build a Rest House in the town.

Tneir rates of pay Awath - Cook Abdulla Bearer Said ' Faraj Sweeper Th. 20 per month Th. 15 ' •• Th. 15 ' ' Th. 10 ' H b) Transport . T.xis presents a,problem since apart from the Sultan’s Ford V8 saloon, horses and camels provide the only means of transport. On the initial sun the Sultan put his car and 2 horses at our disposal andt saved at least a day. The aerodrome is 3.9 miles from to Fort - fifteen minutes by car and 20 minutes gallop by ho through a short cut. Four horses have been aired as from the 6tn November and •Arab saddles are being obtained fron Major rettifer in Muscat. A dnow has already left Muscat for Salalan with the Sultan’s 3 ton lorry and he nas kindly promised to put it at our disposal during tne building operations if we can provide aim witn petrol. If 200 gallons of motor spirit cannot ; be shipped for tnis purpose in,the tanker, arran? can be made to ship it by dhow from Muscat. Climate . As far as can be ascertained from local information, &lt; conditions of low cloud are experienced for to eight hours at a time during tne monsoon season. July and August. Tne prevailing wind is from 190 tm ^ although during tne winter strong off snore winds are si times experienced bringing dust £ with low visibility' - : • fr , y r ■ .f t winds have been known to last from four'to five days.

The present value of the Thaler is Ss.1.0.6 but this fluctuates. Jui ing tne course of trie next few weeks the Sultan is iloating new nickel money and it is probable that the bcii^a in ualalah id. 11 be brought to the Muscat level. The itoyal i int,is at present at Salalah. Rupees are not current. Co rnmunl cat! ons oalalah has no postal facilities, communication wita tne outside world being by .dhow to Muscat 'and Aden o • : . r ... during cue montiis September to May only. During the monsoons i.e. June to August no shipping traffic calls at Salalah but a camel messenger travels between Salalah and Muscat During tne winter months dhows make the journey once a month taxing 25 days for tne journey/between nine and twenty- days : . It is interesting to record that the Sultan has installed a. transmitter and receiver in his Fort. He wishes to maintain contact with Cables &amp; wireless at Muscat with tnis set on 29 metres. It is in the process of being installed arid we snail be able to make use of it when necessary. The transmitter is home made and the receiver a Hallicrafter SK.25. Tanker Arrangements . Ine - tanker wi±l anchor about,a mile from tne shore - %. ^ 4 - •, n 4 and arrangements nave been made, for it t: be met by four belluris and 50 coolies. It should be emphasised that the cargo can be put on the shore only under calm conditions since the beacii is open and the surf rolling. There will be some difficulty m getting the Austin generator ashore but the uali assures me that he nas carried our similar operations satisfactorily. It is anticipated tnat it will take aboutfive days to discharge trie Salalah load, ii conditions arlf calm. •*;J •' # It will he necessary to pay Customs Duty on the cargo and' papers nave already been lodged with the Direct?,, of Customs in Muscat. Arrangements have Deen made to clga on sight. Political The Saltan is very anxious to do all ne can to help us organise Salalah aerodrome and buildings.

At the request of : tne Political Agent and with tne autnority of Mr. Campbefl a local flight was made at Salalah, on which the Sultan,; | and Suite’were passengers.

This leads out to the open sea after approximately 1400 yards. Pilots must watch for cross winds over this gap (WNW) when condition con be very turbulent and sharp downward currents experienced with winds over fifteen miles an hour. In the early mornings there is no indication of this WWW wind either on the aerodrome or over the town of kuscat. SALALAH LAxlDING GROUND This landing ground is situated one mile north of Salalah town and coast line. It is rectangle 1200 x 1000 yds with the longer sides east and west. The surface is very rough a t present and the best alighting area is along side the east boundary upto 200 yds. inside this boundary. A large protion of the western boundary has fallen into disuse. This section has been marked off. Mr. Campbell of the Government of India has made a rough survey of the area and levelling work will be taken in hand in the near • future. Salalah town is the only land mark of any importance between Ras Risut and Ras Merbat. It is a town of 5000 inhabitants where^ fresh drinking water, cocoanuts, mutton, milk, rice, sugar and a is'.' vegetables can be obtained. (Sd). H.E. Mayes.
