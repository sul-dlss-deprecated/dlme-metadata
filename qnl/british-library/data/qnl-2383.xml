Sir, With reference to recent correspondence regarding a proposed combine of British and foreign interests for the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the time has now come when the Turkish Government should be pressed for a reply to the British memorandum of 18th July last regarding the Baghdad Railway and kindred matters. The Marquess of Crewe is not insensible of the objections to taking this step when the Turkish Government are already deeply involved in other embarras- ments. But he observes that, while they on their side have already asked the gratuitous assent of His Majesty's Government to the four per cent increase in the Customs duties, the activity of the Deutsche and National Banks in connexion with the navigation of the rivers and the exploitation of oil-fields in Mesopotamia seems likely to alter the situation seriously to the detriment of British interests in those regions. He also apprehends that, if a settlement of the Baghdad Railway and other questions dealt with in the British memorandum is postponed until the war is over, the Turkish Government will be found more impracticable than ever in respect of its Asiatic possessions. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient Servant, T. W. HOLDERNESS. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. yti ,1 i,P I 18 G, M f Press, Simla.—No. C, 628 F. D,—6-1-13,—30.—J, N.

Sir L. Mallet addressed to the Under Secretary of State for India on August 21st. I think that Mr. Marling is under some misconception as to the object which His Majesty's Government have ii&gt; view ; they\aye no desire to veto communica tion between the local authorities and the Comnoission *, on the contrary, they are persuaded that such communication must, in practice, prove indispensable, but they attach great importance to securing to the Commission the right to corres pond direct with the Central authorities, and they consider that it is essential to the success of the Commission that it should not be dependent on the decisions of, or hampered by the obstrvictions of, arbitrary local offibials. I request that Youjf Excellency will bring this despatch to the notice of Mr. Marling on his return to his post. {Received on 16th December 1912, with Political Secretary's November 1912). i r No. 48, dated 29th India Ofbjce, Whitehall, London, S.

MATTHEWS.21 Snclosure 2 in No. 1. Summary of f ork done on the Baghdad Railway. The construction of the Bghdad Railway has proceeded steadily during the years 1910-12. The line beyond Ulu Kishla has been laid to within a few kilo metres of Bozanti, and will probably be opened to traffic in 1913. Between Bozanti and Dorak work is proceeding on the tunnels through the Taurus, of which there will be at least tea, the longest being one of 3 kilom. some ISkilom. beyond Bozanti. There is a daily train service on the section of 140 kilom. .from Dorak to Mamureh, via Yenijeh, Adana, Missis, Hamidieh, Toprak Kaleh and Osmanieh, which was opened to traffic in April 1912. Considerable progress has been made on the short but difficult section from Mamureh to Baghcheh, which should be ready for traffic in 1913. Near Baghcheh a tunnel of 5 kilom., of which about Ij kilom. have been completed, is being made through the Amanus. It is stated that the Taurus and Amanus tunnels will be finished in 1915. Work is also proceeding on the branch line from Toprak Kaleh to Alexandretta, about 70 kilom. in length, tvhich is unlikely to be ready for traffic before the end of 1913. When the branch line to Alexandretta is opened, it is probable that the pro duce of the eastern section of the Cilician Plain, most of which is at present ex ported from Ayas, will be exported from Alexandretta.

I asked His Excellency whether he could tell ne whether the present Government had considered the matter and whether an answer could be expected shortly. His Excellency replied that he himself had exanined the memorandum in a general manner, though not in great detail, but that tie Cabinet had not had to do so. He and the other members of the Cabinet Yere sincerely desirous of settling all outstanding points of difference that exisfed with His Majesty's Government, and once the serious questions, like the lalkan War, etc., which pre-occupied the Government, were disposed of, he would b&gt; prepared to examine the matter and reply to His Majesty's Government. It does not appear to me that we can further press tb Government at this moment, but if the present Government remains in power after the conclusion of peace or if it should be followed by one of moderate views, the Turkish Govern ment should be pressed for a reply.

North of that point coastwards he claims everything as far as Khor Abdullah including Failakah, Bubian, V/arbah and their waters. On the north he includes Um Kasr and Safwan in his limits. From Safwan boundary goes due west to Batin and thence follows Batin to include Hafar thence to the most southerly point in the south centre which he places at A1 Habeh said to be just south of Minaisir-al-Ghara.

It is left to you to find the form likely to be the most palatable to him, but details should be avoided, and , lest the Turks should get wind of it , it Is most undesirable that the possible compromise should be mentionned.

Hirtzel to Mr. Parker.—{Received February 27.) My dear Parker, India Office, February 26, 1913. BY Lord Crewe's instructions I enclose a statement of a possible basis of compromise as regards Koweit. His Lordship hopes that it will not be used except in case of real necessity, since the sheikb will certainly regard it with suspicion, and will (Cox anticipates) already be greatly disappointed by the loss of Um Kasr, Safwan, and Musallamiya, to say nothing of Anta'a. As to this last, Lord Crewe suggests without pressing it—that if opportunity offers for obtaining a rectification of the southern limit so as to include Anta'a (as shown in green on the map enclosed) it should be taken. I enclose some extracts from an earlier report of Knox's which show the strength of the sheikh's claims. It should in any case be pointed out to Hakki that all our claims are based, not on the sheikh's unsupported statements, but on the evidence collected during the last five years by our own officers, who have personally examined the whole frontier. As regards the Turkish request for a right of way for their troops, Lord Crewe is at a loss to understand why they should want it, seeing that they apparently have easier means of access to Central Arabia (either by way of the Uedjaz, or from the Persian Gulf via Ojeir and Hofuf, where they already have garrisons). He would, therefore, be disposed to refuse, unless it is strongly pressed for. If conceded it should be guarded by a strong proviso that no posts or garrisons are to be established along the line of march or elsewhere. You will have noticed that the Government of India ask that if the compromise is adopted they may have time and opportunity to explain the nature of it to the sheikh before news of it can reach him from Turkish sources. Lord Crewe attaches importance to this. Yours, &amp;c. A. HIRTZEL. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Statement. THE limits of Koweit and of the tribes subordinate to the sheikh are as /-'N defined in annex 4 to the British note of the 18th Jul} 7 ', 1912. That is to say:— 2. From the coast at the mouth of the Khor-es-Zubair the line proceeds in a north-westerly direction up to and past the walls of the port at Safwan to Jebel Sanam and the Ar Ratq ridge. From the latter point it runs in a south-westerly direction along the Batin to, and including, the wells of Hafar, whence it turns to the south-east between the districts of Summan and Dabanah, till it reaches the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. From that point it runs north-east to the Na'airiyah till at the north-west corner of Radaif, and thence to the coast at Jebel Manifah. 3. The islands included in the limits of Koweit are those mentioned in the annex above referred to. 4. Within the limits specified a circle shall be drawn with Koweit town as its centre and a radius of approximately 60 English miles, including Warba Island and the mid-channel of the Khor Abdullah to the north, Qrain Hill to the south, and Kubbar Island to the south-east. Within the territory thus circumscribed the complete autonomy of the Sheikh of Koweit shall be guaranteed, as defined in the British note of the 29th July, 1911. 5. Outside this circle and within the wider limits described in paragraph 1, the existing status quo shall be maintained, i.e., the sheikh shall continue to levy titles, [2808 dd—l]and there shall be no direct Turkish administration, and no Turkish garrisons ; and, further, the Turkish Government shall agree to take no action, military or other, within those limits without previous arrangement with us. 6. Provided that there shall be a right of way for the passage of Turkish troops by the recognised caravan routes across Koweit limits in the direction of Nejd, without, however, the right of establishing posts and garrisons as above mentioned. Enclosure 2 in Xo. 1. Antaa. Extract of letter from Major S. G. Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, dated the 23rd May, 1 908, IT does not appear, so far as my information goes, that Anta'a is in any shape or form a portion of the Walayat of Bussorah. It was a halting place thirty-tive years ago for the Turkish expeditionary force that took A1 Ahsa and, since then, only one Turkish olficial has ever visited it, and he formed the solitary Turk in a raiding party of the Ajman tribe on the Umtair. The inhabitants declare themselves to be subjects of Sheikh Mubarak-as-Subah, and this is supported by the statement of the sheikh, but it would seem that the de facto suzerain at present is Muhammad-bin-Hithlain, Sheikh of the Ajman, who was imprisoned last year by Sheikh Mubarak. Enclosure 3 in No. 1.. Extracts from Major Knox's Report. THE political agent was unfortunately bound by his own voluntary undertaking given to Sheikh Mubarak that he would not proceed further south than Anta'a village^ and so nothing better than a short excursion to the hill of Midr'a, which permitted of the return in one day, could be attempted, but the Wadi-al-Amya promises to repay further examination. It does not appear that the 1 urk has ever established any effective occupation there, and to elicit this fact alone has amply repaid the political agent for his journey. 1 he people of Anta a maintained, without leading questions, that their relations with Koweit \veie of the most friendly and binding nature, and that they considered the Sheikh of Koweit as their suzerain rather than the Amirs of Riadh or the Turk at El Ahsa. Sheikh Mubarak looks upon Anta'a as within the Koweit boundaries, and the fact of thc^ welcome received b\ the political agent, and the possibility of his travelling the 150 miles to that point without the slightest molestation of any kind, lends support to the view, and enables one to form an estimate of the hold that the Koweit Sheikh has obtained over the surrounding country. Foreign visitors have, up to date, been only Turkish. The first was one A1 Eakhri, who had with him soldiers in the time of Ibrahim Pasha, who took Addir' lya, probably an Egyptian. Then came a Turkish commandant with soldiers about thirty-five years ago [?] at the time of the Turks' entry into El 'Ahsa. After this visit came another, Brahim Passa, unaccompanied by soldiers this time, and apparently raiding with the famous Ajman chief, Raikan, on the I mtan. I his gentleman is said to have formed a project for building a fort here for the Turkish Government, but it came to nothing. Apparently, the people of Anta'a do not pay tribute to anybody except the akhawat to the Bedouins, neither to Bin S'ud, nor to Bin Subah, nor to the Turks. Sheikh's rights are one-tenth of produce of village, but no other rights whatever. Difficult cases are brought to Koweit for shara' settlement.Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Extract of letter from Captain W. H. J. Shakespear, Political Agent, dated Koweit, the 23rd March, 1910. ACCORDING to Bedouin information, it would seem that my route ran for some days along what is recognised as the boundary of Sheikh Mubarak's territory. It may be of interest to note that this territory would be included by a line joining Jasirat-al-Amayir (or Jinna ?) on the coast with Anta'a, thence to As Safa, A1 Hafar, following A1 Batin to Ar Ratk, whence east-south-east to the Khor-um-Kasr to just south of that fort, and the sea on the east. Some doubt seemed to exist as to whether Warba and Bubiyan Islands could be included, but Falaikha certainly is. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Extract from Captain Shakespear 7 s Diary, dated the 2bth February, 1910.

No. 637. Dated 3.4.13. With reference to your telegram No. 24 S on the subject of Koweit. Up to the present Only an ad interim reply has been sent to the SheiVh by return of post , in which Mid the receipt of his expositioij of the boundary is acknowledged and in which he is told that at the earliest opportunity he will be informed of the action taken on it. He has just passed Fao on his way to Koweit after staying with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and a short visit to B/.asrah. It is possible that he may have been plied with a misleading version of the details of the negotiations^now taking plaoe^by the Wali, and if this is the case the next post will probably bring a commibnication from hin. Failing that , sons idering the political situation which prevails at Constantinople , I should recommend that for the present he should merely be informed in writing by me , as if from myself, that it is hoped , now t&gt;mt the war is finished , that progress will be made with the negotiations with the Turkish GoVt. , but that he will understand the necessity fior the adoption of a give and take attitude both in regard to this and other items of the negotiations , that it is hoped that he will leave himself in our hands in regard to the negotiations in general , and that he will rely on the fact that we are determined to «*»ure his local autonomy and more important practical interests and to effect the best comprehensive settlement of the others that we are able to. In conclusion I would add that Government have been askedto keep me au fait with the progress of negotiations as far as may be. —It is reooinmended that , until he can be definitely inform- -ed of our arrangemeBt , we should avoid saying more. The P.A. will, unfortunately, be away all this month as he is on tour; but in the meanwhile I could go over to Koweit add talk to him confidentially on the matter should his letters show that he is getting uneasy.

Koweit Draft Agreement. HIS Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and His Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, animated by the sincere desire to settle by mutual agreement certain questions concerning their interests, have determined to conclude agreements destined to prevent all cause of misunderstanding between Great Britain and Turkey in regard to the questions referred to, and have nominated for this purpose their respective plenipotentiaries, to wit: Who, having communicated to each other their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed on the following:— * Agreement concerning Koweit. The Governments of Great Britain and Turkey being desirous of placing beyond all doubt the status and limits of Koweit ( and th e adjacent terr itory^ as respectively defined in articles 5 and 7 of this agreement, and the relations between the Sheikh of Koweit and Turkey, and taking into consideration the special interests of Great Britain in Koweit, and the lonof-established relations between Great Britain and the Sheikhs of ' O Koweit; Have agreed upon the following articles :— 1. Great Britain and Turkey recognise Koweit, as defined in article 4 of this agreement, as nn autonomous sheikhdom under the suzerainty of Turkey. 2. Great Britain and Turkey recognise the Sheikh of Koweit as a Turkish kaimakam. 3. Great Britain and Turkey recognise the right of the Sheikh of Koweit to^ exercise complete autonomy within the limits laid down in article 4 of this agreement. Turkey undertakes to abstain from any infringement of such autonomy, and from any interference with the succession, internal administration, or foreign relati o ns of Koweit. 4. Nothing in this agreement shall be taken to prevent Turkeylrom appointing an agent at Koweit. 4 5. For the purposes of art icles 1 and 3 o f th is agreement the limits of Koweit are agreed to be a segment of a circle drawn with the centre of Koweit town as its centre and a radius extending from that point to the mid-channel of the Khor Abdulla at its northernmost point between the island of Warba and the mainland, to include Krain in the south, and to a point at a corresponding distance from the centre of Koweit in the west. Within these limits are also understood to be included the islands of Bubiyan, Mashian, Failakah, Anhah, Kubbar, Karu, and Tjmm-al-Maradim, and the islets adjacent thereto, 6. Great Britain and Turkey recognise as subordinate to the Sheikh of Koweit the tribes within the territory defined in article 7 of this agreement. The Sheikh of Koweit shall continue to levy tithes from such tribes as at present, and shall conduct such administration as may be necessary in his capacity as Turkish kaimakam. W ithin the territory defined in article 7 of this agreement lurkey undertakes^ not to sot up any administration apart from that ot the Sheikh of Koweit, and not, without previous arrangement with Great Britain, to station any garrisons nor take any military or other action. 7.

That reply may thus perhaps become the basis for resuming negotiations for the preliminaries of peace.

His Lordship hopes that it will not be used except in case of real necessity, since the Shaikh will certainly regard it with suspicion, and will (Cox anticipates) already be greatly disappointed by the loss of Um Kasr, Safwan and Musallamiya, to say nothing of Anta'a. As to this last. Lord Crewe suggests—without pressing it—that if opportunity offers for obtaining a rectifica tion of the southern limit so as to include t Ate extract from letter from Major Knox-, Anta'a (as shown in red on the map*) it dated 23rd May 1 SOS; extract from letter from should be taken. 1 enclose Some extracts Captain Shpkespear, dated 23rd March 1910, from an earlier report of Knox'sf which r? f x »^V r K m Ca ?om n Shake8pear ' s I)iar - V ' show the strength of the Shaikh's claims. dated 25th February 1910. s Tx i. u • U It should in any case be pointed out to Hakki that all our claims are based not on the Shaikh's unsupported statements, but on the evidence collected during the last five years by our own officers, who have personally examined the whole frontier. As regards the Turkish request for a right of way for their troops, Lord Crewe is at a loss to understand why they should want it, seeing that they apparently have easier means of access to Central Arabia, either by way of the Hedjaz or from28 the Persian Gulf via Ojeir and Hofuf (where they already have garrisons). He would, therefore, be disposed to refuse, unless it is strongly pressed for. If conceded, it should be guarded by a firm proviso that no posts or garrisons are to be established along the line of march or elsewhere. ■, ■ ; You will have noticed that the Government of India ask that if the compro mise is adopted they may have time and opportunity to explain the nature of it to the Shaikh before news of it can reach him from Turkish sources. Lord Crewe attaches importance to this. Statement. ! 1. The limits of Kuwait and of the tribes subordinate to the Shaikh are as defined in annex 4 to the British Note of 18th July 1912. That is to say :— 2. From the coast at the mouth of the Khor es Zubair the line proceeds in a N.-W. direction up to and past the walls of the fort at Safwan to Jebel Sanam and the Ar Ratq ridge. From the latter point it runs in a S.-W. direction along the Batin to, and including, the wells of Hafar, whence it turns to the S.-E. between the districts of Summan and Dahanah till it reaches the route from Wabrah to Eiyadh. From that point it runs N.-E. to the Na'airiyah hill at the N.-W. corner of Radaif, and thence to the coast at Jebel Manifah. 3. The islands included in the limits of Kuwait are those mentioned in the annex above referred to. 4. Within the limits specified, a circle shall be drawn with Kuwait town as its centre and a radius of approximately 60 English miles, including Warba Island and the mid-channel of the Khor Abdullah to the north, Qrain hill to the south, and Kubbar Island to the south-fast . Within the territory thus circumscribed the complete autonomy of the Shaikh of Kuwait shall be guaranteed, as defined in the British note of 29th July 1911. 5. Outside this circle and within the wider limits described in paragraph 1, the existing status quo shall be maintained, i.e., the Shaikh shall continue to levy tithes and there shall be no direct Turkish administration and no Turkish garri sons ; and further the Turkish Government shall agree to take no action, military or other, within those limits without previous arrangement with us. 6. Provided that there shall be a right of way for the passage of Turkish troops by the recognised caravan routes across Kuwait limits in the direction of Nejd, without, however, the right of establishing posts and garrisons as above- mentioned.

India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received February 26.) THE Under-Secretary of State for India presents his compliments to the Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and forwards herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State, copy of an enclosure in a covering letter from the political resident in the Persian Gulf dated the 4th August, 1912, on the subject of the limits of Koweit. A copy of map referred to in the enclosure is the only one in the possession of the India Office, and its early return is requested. India Office, February 25, 1913. I HAVE the honour to refer to the Secretary of State's telegram of the 26th July galling for evidence demonstrating the control over tribes exercised by Sheikh Mobarak within the limits referred to in Mr. J. G. Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf. 2. A reference to the political agent at Koweit on the subject has been necessary and on receipt of his reply Government will be addressed by telegraph. Meanwhile I have the honour to state that a careful study of records since 1897 bearing on the question of the limits of the Sheikh's effective influence inclines me to the view, as I shall proceed to explain, that, if it is still possible to arrange for the adoption of a slight modification of Mr. Lorimer's line, it would be expedient to do so, I would explain in this connection that both when telegraphing to the Government of India on the 26th March, 1911 and on the 6th July, 1912, I was absent from my head-quarters and archives and had to reply without reference to them. 3. I may commence by inviting reference to the line which Captain Shakespear indicated, in a report on his tour in the Koweit hinterland, as being in his opinion the boundary of the principality. It is somewhat less extensive, but to the southwards, a good deal more definite, than that indicated by Mr. Lorimer, upon such scanty information upon the subject as was available to him. It, however, includes Anta'a (Nta'), a group of villages of considerable importance (vide Map of the Koweit hinterland Survey of India June 1910, 8-miles to 1-inch), which Captain Knox's reports of 1908 give good grounds for regarding as within the domains of Sheikh Mobarak ; and the statement of the Porte that it is part of the vilayet of Bussorah is presumably on all fours with their claim that Koweit is also in that province. Its headman in 1908, at any rate, was a nominee of the Sheikh of Koweit. 4. It will be seen that Captain Shakespear also includes within the limits of Koweit district, Jazirat 'al Amayir, an island inside Musallamiyah Bay. This is identical with the Bay of Balbul which was described by Mr. J. C. Gaskin, in his report to the resident on the 6th September, 1897, as the southern boundary of Koweit. This report, it would appear, was not forwarded to Government, though an account of the results of Mr. Gaskin's visit, in connection with which the report was made, will be found in residency letter of the 20th September, 1897 to the Government of India. This testimony, given at a date considerably anterior to our assurances, is of considerable value. It is true that the political resident expressed doubts as to the validity of the Sheikh's claim to the island when forwarding it to the Government of India in 1902, but he gave no reasons for doing so, and the fact that the attempt of the Turks made about that time to place troops on the island failed, would seem to give us ground to include the island within the principality. There are no Turkish troops on the island at the present time. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Government of India. Sir, Bushire, August 4, 1912. [2808 cc—2]In making these observations, however, I do not overlook the fact that the view has been expressed by His Majesty's Foreign Office and concurred in by the India Office that the Sheikh's claims cannot be sustained so far south as Musalliyah Bay. I do not know precisely on what evidence or absence of evidence that decision is based, but I realise that it may not be possible at this stage to consider the inclusion of that feature. 5. The next point after Anta'a mentioned by Captain Shakespear is A1 Safah. In a country were water is a precious commodity, to be found only at certain spots, often many miles distant from each other, the inclusion of such wells within the boundaries of a principality is of the greatest importance, and as these wells appear, from Captain Shakespear's report, to be used exclusively by the tribes under Sheikh Mobarak's control, and to have at no time been touched bv Turkish influence, there seems everv eround to include Safah within the principality. ^ 6. We next come to Hafar. The stragetio importance to the Sheikh of Koweit of this point will be apparent from a glance at the map. It is a half-way house to Buraidah, Riyadh and Hail, and has a constant supply of water. It is a well known outpost, and its possession by Sheikh Mobarak and the tribes under his control never seems to have been seriously questioned. During the troubles that took place in 1901, he used the place as a rallying point for his forces and claimed it as in his territory and was greatly incensed with Bin Rashid, who had camped there for a time and consumed the pastures of bueikh Mobarak s tribes. 1 he latter laid a formal complaint before the resident of the action of Bin Rashid in a letter dated the 22nd October, 1901, an extract trom which is quoted in the margin.* 1 he statement regarding Hafar was repeated incidently in a communication from the Sheikh to the resident dated the 17th November, 1901. 7. From Hafar the boundary line assigned to the Koweit district alike by Mr. Lorimer and Captain Shakespear is the Batin, a broad low depression in the desert, in which water can generally be found at no great depth, and which contains excellent grazing. Beyond it stretches desert, almost uninhabited and quite unfertile. The Batin is a well known and well marked boundary and a tract of great value to Bedouins. There seems no reason to think that it hus been inhabited, except spasmodically, by tribes other than those under the influence of the Sheikh of Koweit. 8. It may be parenthetically remarked here that whereas Mr. Lorimer had to rely upon the word of the Sheikh for his description of the boundary to the westward, it has now been personally examined by Major Knox and Captain Shakespear, with the results mentioned above, which generally speaking tend to confirm the Sheikh's claims. ^ 9. The position of the northern boundary alone has been subjected in the past to close examination. Captain Shakespear makes the well marked Ar Katq Ridge the north-western corner of the principality ; the point seems a suitable one for the purpose and will, I trust, be adopted. Thence it has been held to run through Jabal Sanam, another prominent point, to the sea immediately south of Umm Kasr. 10. The Sheikh s claims to Safwan are, I think, a good deal stronger than has generally been thought, and might have been supported with good reason, but it seems probable that as regards this point we are committed vis-d-vis the Porte to recognise it as beyond the limits of Koweit; the Sheikh's influence, however, is without doubt unquestioned up to the walls of the fort at bafwan and this fact should receive recognition when the boundary is fixed. Mr. J. C. Gaskm in his report of the 6th September^ 1897, gives Safwan as the northern boundary of the principality and it has always been a camping ground of his tribes. His Majesty's consul, Bussorah, reported in 1902 that in his opinion the Turkish Government never thought of exercising authority over either Safwan or Umm Kasr until recent events. The Sheikhs claim to Safwan is recorded in a letter to the resident dated the 7th February, 1902, and he further said to the senior naval oflicer who interrogated him on the subject, that there were eight or ten families of sedentary Bin Hanedi and Bin Tarki there, who had lived there permanently for 40 years. They paid him no regular tribute, he said, but supplied him from time to time with grass and onions as a recognition of their subordination to him.]' 11. hen discussing with me a month ago, various newspaper reports suggesting that the Bagdad Railway was likely to find its terminus at Umm Kasr, under the aegis of lurkey. Sheikh Mobarak made it evident that he felt strongly on the subject of that Bin Rasbid is at Hafar, which is distant three days journey from Koweit; our own cattle and those of our tribesmen are prevented by him from grazing; we have consequently suffered great loss. . . . We, as directed by you, are quite in our own country and are under the shadow of your protection. It is therefore necessary that l&gt;iu Kasliid should be made to quit these places, which are in our boundaries.' t • . • . . Regarding iSafwnn, the crops of grain produced there are under my authority and protection. TJie locality of my tribes is west of it and they go there in summer where there is water. Before now the Turks or others had not laid their hand on Safwan.'oint and emphatically claimed it as his own possession. Probably in reality his claim as as much validity as those of the Turks who previous to 1901 had never shown any interest in the place. But His Majesty's Government have decided 10 years ago that they would not support his claim to this outpost and I presume that they will not alter that decision now in any case; fortunately the place loses much of its stragetical value if Warba and Bubyan are retained by the Sheikh. In regard to these islands we have I think every reason to insist on the Sheikh's rights, both on their intrinsic merits and as a matter of political expediency. Major Knox's reports on the rights of the Sheikh and his tribesmen in regard to them were submitted to Government in 1908 vide enclosure to Government of India, despatch No. 168, Secret External, dated the 10th September, 1 908. 12. As regards other islands, I presume His Majesty's Gov em men tw i 11 be able to provide for the recognition of the Sheikh's ownership or at all events his predominance, in those mentioned by Mr. Lorimer. 13. There remains one or two other points not directly referred to in the Secretary of State's telegram under reply, to which I would invite reference. Firstly, I presume that the phrase ' town, harbour and immediate surroundings ' used in India Office telegram dated the 1st July includes the whole of Koweit Bay from Sabiyah to Ras-al-Ardh, together with Jahreh, the possession of which is a vital necessity to the Sheikh. In this connection I would invite reference to the marginally noted military report, which described very well the attitude of the Sheikh to the possession of Jahreh and the importance of its retention in connection with our Kadhamah concession. 14. The conclusion to which the considerations set forth in the foregoing paragraphs bring me, subject to confirmation or modification, on receiving the report which I await from Captain Shakespear, is that if it is still possible as between ourselves and the Turks, to work in a slightly different line to that described by Mr. Lorimer, it will be both in the interest of the Sheikh and at the same time more palatable to the Turks, if we can arrange for recognition of the line subject to the slight modification mentioned below, indicated by Captain Shakespear, which while conceding a broad strip of territory to Turkey effectively safeguards the Sheikh's rights and influence over his tribes at strategic points and at the same time has the substantial advantage of affording a well defined frontier, a consideration which the Sheikh will, I have no doubt, appreciate. 15. The modification which I recommend is that the boundary on the coast should be arbitrarily held to be at Jabal Manifah and from thence to proceed south-west to include Anta'a and thence along Captain Shakespear's boundary via A1 Safah, Hafar and A1 Batin as indicated on the accompanying copy of the most recent map.

Sir A. Hirtzel to Mr. Parker — {Received February 27.) My dear Parker, India Office, February 26, 1913. BY Lord Crewe's instmctioiis I enclose a statement of a possible basis of compromise as regards Koweit. His Lordship hopes that it will not be nsed except in case of real necessity, since the sheikh will certainly regard it with suspicion, and will (Cox anticipates) already he greatly disappointed by the loss of Um Kasr, Safwan, and Musallamiya, to say nothing of Anta'a. As to this last,^ Lord Crewe suggests- without pressing it—that if opportunity offers ior obtaining a rectification of the southern limit so as to include Anta'a (as shown in green on the map enclosed) it should be taken. I enclose some extracts from an earlier report of Knox s which show the strength of the sheikh's claims. Ii should in any case be pointed out to Hakki that all our claims are based, not on the sheikh's unsupported statements, but on the evidence collected during the last live years by our own officers, who have personally examined the whole frontier. ^ t n • As regards the Turkish request for a right of way for their troops, Lord Crewe is at a loss to understand why they should want it, seeing that they apparently have easier means of access to Central Arabia (either by way of the Hedjaz, or from the Persian Gulf via Ojeir and Hofuf, where they already have garrisons). He would, therefore, be disposed to refuse, unless it is strongly pressed for. If conceded it should be guarded by a strong proviso that no posts or garrisons are to be established along the line of march or elsewhere. You will have noticed that the Government of India ask that if the compromise is adopted they may have time and opportunity to explain the nature of it to the sheikh before news of it can reach him from Turkish sources. Lord Crewe attaches importance to this. Yours, &amp;c. A. HIRTZEL. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Statement THE limits of Koweit and of the tribes subordinate to the sheikh are as defined in annex 4 to the British note of the 18th July, 1012. That is to say: 2. From the coast at the mouth of the Khor-es-Zubair the line proceeds in a north-westerly direction up to and past the walls of the port at Safwan to Jebel banam and the Ar Ratq ridge. From the latter point it runs in a south-westerly direction along the Batin to, and including, the wells of Hafar, whence it turns to the south-east between the districts of Summan and Dabanah, till it reaches the route from abrah to Riyadh. From that point it runs north-east to the Na'airiyah till at the north-west corner of Radaif, and thence to the coast at Jebel Manifah. 3. The islands included in the limits of Koweit are those mentioned in the annex above referred to. ^ 4. Within the limits specified a circle shall be drawn with Koweit town as its centre and a radius of approximately 60 English miles, including Warba Island and the mid-channel of the Khor Abdullah to the north, Qrain Hill to the south, and Kubbar Island to the south-east. Within the territory thus circumscribed the complete autonomy of the Sheikh of Koweit shall be guaranteed, as defined in the British note of the 29th July, 1911. 5. Outside this circle and within the wider limits described in paragraph 1, the existing status quo shall be maintained, i.e., the sheikh shall continue to levy tithes, [2808 dd—l]and there shall be no direct Turkish administration, and no Turkish garrisons ; and, further, the Turkish Government shall agree to take no action, military or other, within those limits without previous arrangement with us. 6. Provided that there shall be a right of way for the passage of Turkish troops by the recognised caravan routes across Koweit limits in the direction of Nejd, without, however, the right of establishing posts and garrisons as above mentioned. Enclosure 2 in Ko. 1. Antaa. Extract of letter from 'Major S. G. Knox, Political Agent, Kowcit, dated the 23rd May, J 908. IT does not appear, so far as my information goes, that Anta'a is in any shape or form a portion of the Walayat of Bussorah. It was a halting place thirty-five years ago for the Turkish expeditionary force that took A1 Ahsa and, since then, only one Turkish official has ever visited it, and he formed the solitary Turk in a raiding party of the Ajman tribe on the Umtair. The inhabitants declare themselves to be subjects of Sheikh Mubarak-as-Subah, and this is supported by the statement of the sheikh, but it would seem that the de facto suzerain at present is Muhammad-bin-Hithlain, Sheikh of the Ajman, who was imprisoned last year by Sheikh Mubarak. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Extracts from Major Knox's Report. THE political agent was unfortunately bound by his own voluntary undertaking given to Sheikh Mubarak that he would not proceed further south than Anta'a villages, and so nothing better than a short excursion to the hill of Midr'a, which permitted of the return in one day, could be attempted, but the Wadi-al-Amya promises to repay further examination. It does not appear that the Turk has ever established any effective occupation there, and to elicit this fact alone has amply repaid the political agent for his journey. The people of Anta'a maintained, without leading questions, that their relations with Koweit were of the most friendly and binding nature, and that they considered the Sheikh of Koweit as their suzerain rather than the Amirs of Riadh or the Turk at El Ahsa. Sheikh Mubarak looks upon Anta'a as within the Koweit boundaries, and the fact of the welcome received by the political agent, and the possibility of his travelling tbe 150 miles to that point without the slightest molestation of any kind, lends support to the view, and enables one to form an estimate of the hold that the Koweit Sheikh has obtained over the surrounding country. Foreign visitors have, up to date, been only Turkish. The first was one A1 Fakhri, who had with him soldiers in the time of Ibrahim Pasha, who took Addir' lya, probably an Egyptian. Then came a T urkish commandant with soldiers about thirty-five years ago [?] at the time of the Turks' entry into El 'Ahsa. After this visit came another, Brahim Passa, unaccompanied by soldiers this time, and apparently raiding with the famous Ajman chief, Raikan, on the Umtair. This gentleman is said to have formed a project for building a fort here for the Turkish Government, but it came to nothing. Apparently, the people of Anta'a do not pay tribute to anybody except the akhawat to the Bedouins, neither to Bin S'ud, nor to Bin Subah, nor to the Turks. Sheikh's rights are one-tenth of produce of village, but no other rights whatever. Difficult cases are brought to Koweit for shara' settlement.-]C 3 Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Extract of letter from Captain W. H. J. Shakespear, Political Agent, dated Koweit, the 23rd March, 1910. ACCORDING to Bedouin information, it would seem that my route ran for some days along what is recognised as the boundary of Sheikh Mubarak's territory. It may be of interest to note that this territory would be included by a line joining Jasirat-al-Amayir (or Jinna?) on the coast with Anta'a, thence to As Safa, A1 Hafar, following A1 Batin to Ar Ratk, whence east-south-east to the Khor-um-Kasr to just south of that fort, and the sea on the east. Some doubt seemed to exist as to whether Warba and Bubiyan Islands could be included, but Falaikha certainly is. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Extract from Captain Shahespcai's Diary, dated the 2oth February, 1910. MARCHED at 8'25 and struck a bit south-west to make the high road between Jahara and Safwan, which runs almost perfectly straight between the two places, and not as shown on the map. W ere sniped at for some time by Thukara, who refused to be convinced by the waving of cloaks that we were peaceable travellers. Finally, had to go and threaten them with Mubarak's wrath before they would desist. Captain G. B. Brucks, 1829.—' From Grane to Khore-el-Kulfagee along the Arabian coast the authority of the Sheikh of Grane is partially acknowledged by the Bedouin tribe, who are mostly of the A1 Ali, and a branch of the Beni Kalid, and some wandering parties of other tribes; also some few straggling camps of the Montifie tribe, who come this way at certain seasons.'

The India Office has sent me, under a D.O. letter dated 18th April a copy of the final draft agreement. The Political AgeAt after perusal of recent papers on his return from tour has also addressed me on the subject. The following representations are made by him. (1). The terms Sanjak and Mutessarif should be substituted for Kaza and Kaimakam as the latter are 'infra dig.' 1 . (2). The possibility of having to receive Turkish Agent has never been dreamed of by the Sheikh who will protest vehemently, and the agent will become centre for all intrigues^which will not be convenient. (3). As the Bedouins will otherwise take advantage of difference of the Sheikh's powers in the two zones, full autonomy should extend to the outer zone. (4). Al Habeh wells which the Sheikh claims vide my tele gram No. 588, have been visited and located by him and ther^ is no doubt that they are situated within the i^^&amp;^under the practical control of the Sheikh. They are located accord ing to the Political Agent, in Longitude 47. 5 f and Latitude 27. 15 1 . 25'. (5). Turkish troops should not be permitted to pass any closer than the road which runs along west of Batin from Busreh to Hafar. My views are as follows Item (1) would serve to make the pill more acceptable to the Sheikh. dA: w UV , Item (2) falls dn with views which have previously been put forwardtjC forward 'but which were not found acceptable. Item (3) which is important^but at the same time I am afraid a res ^udicata^would naturally 'be welcomed. Item (4) on the grounds that it is in accordance with the position of the boundary as pointed out by the Sheikh himself, and recently investigated on the spot and found to be correct by the Political Agent, may still be obtainable.The proposal contained in Item (5) is supported by me, but it seems that in the final draft there is no mention made of the passage of troops. Cox.^ C.A 'Vwu, 2^ (Received on the 21st April 1913 with Political Secretary's letter No. U, dated the 4th April 1913.) India Office, Whitehall, London, S. W.; p - UQQ ' 31st March 1913. Sir, T am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledo-e the roeeipt of yoiir letter No. 12978, dated the 27th March, forwarding a'draft agreement with the Turkish Government re^ardin? the status of Kuwait. The Marquess of Crewe understands that His Majesty 's Government will still endeavour to obtain Turkish rrcognirion of the limits of Kuwait defined in the British Memorandum, dated 17th (18th ?) Jnlv 1912, and that only if thi a proves impracticable will the concession embodied in the present draft be made. I am to offer the following remarks on the test of the draft: — Prearnhle.—ms Lordship would prefer that the words « and the adjacent territory ' should be omitted, as emphasising unnecessarilv and in a way that may arouse the suspicions of the Shaikh, the distinction between the two areas which is sufficiently clearly drawn in the body of the agreement. . Clause S. Ois Lordship attaches great importance to the reference to ^oreign relations, and trusts that, though it may be difficult for the Turkish Government to accept it, it will be insisted on.' * ^ He ■would prefer to say 'articles 1 to 4', thus limiting the Turkish agent to the narrower area, and lassening the opportunities for intrigue. His Lordship thinks that it might also be desirable to add to the list of islands what is shown on the map as Makta island, although, according to the Gazetteer, no channel exists between it and the mainland. Clause 7.— For ^Hafan' read 'Hafar'. Lord Crewe notes that the map attached to Foreign OfTice Print, Asiatic Turkey, Section 1, February 27, is not quite accurate, in that the green line does not clearly include Wabrah and Al Garaa. The Shaikh is known to be very anxious to retain Anta'a ( Nta), and His Lordship trusts that this may be secured in return for the con- cpssions made in the earlier part of the agreement, and in view of the fact that His Majesty's Government are not supporting the wider claims whieh, as will be seen from the enclosed copy of a telegram from Sir P. Cox, the Shaikh has Dated 26th March 1913, himself made to the Turkish Government. . As the Shaikh expressly claims Um Kasr. it might be advisable to make it clear that His Majesty's Government do not support him by substituting forts at Um Kasr and Safwan' for 'fort at Safwan ' in the third line of this clause. The last two lines of the clause are repeated from clause 6, and seem superfluous. tf\f\J^^ a ' USe ^ uri ^ e i*stood that a reference to the lease agreement of ±907 will be embodied in this clause or else that the Turkish Government will be pressed formally to take note, in a separate document, of the existence of the lease, which was mentioned in Sir E. Grey's Memorandum to the Turkish Ambassador, dated 24th October 1911. Clause 10. Lord Crewe trusts that this will not be included except in the last resort. 1 he natural line of approach for Turkish troops to Nejd does not lie ac ross the area covered by the agreement; and in spite of the safeguards t uit ha\c been inserted this concession may be a source of much difficulty hereafter. Subject to the above remarks His Lordship concurs in the terms of the draft. I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant, ) T. W.

By securing such a right the Turks would in practice be enabled to put pressure on Mubarak, and Koweit would be threatened without the letter of compromise with us being violated, and on the colourable pretext that Central Arabia was the objective of the troops.'

P. From ReQident Bushire. To Foreign Simla. No. 948. Dated 27th May 1913. Up to the 20th May no intimation of the details of the draft comvention regarding Koweit had been made to Shaikh Mubarak, owing to his serious state of health, as before reported. Reuters telegrams of 17th May however contained a forecast of the contents and as these telegrams are ordinarily sent to Koweit, I instructed Political Agent to make averbal communication to the Shaikh, as if)a message from me, inform ing him of what v /wre the probable terras of the Convention as far as would understand. I asked him when doing so to make the Shaikh see that his general position had been assured satisfactorily but that, as is necessary in the case of all of amicable adjustments issues, it had probably been necess ary to for His Majesty's Government to display a give and take attitude in respect of some of the points of detail. I have now received a telegram from the Political Agent report ing that as a whole his communication was fairly well re ceived by the Shaikh, but that latter 'expressed in the strongest and most vehement manner his absolute refusal ever to permit the presence of a Turkish Agent'. Later on after further deliberation Shaikh Mubarak walked over to the Agency in a perturbed state of mind to reiterate his refusal and to ask Political Agent to telegraph his views to higher au thority. He pointed out that he had faithfully observed his engagements with us, and that the specific object of them was to protect him against such a possibility, as that at pre sent contemplated. Political Agent continues that signs are not wanting to show that Shaikh is disposed to think that he has been sac rificed for some quid pro quo and that his attitude will not be altered by anything but the strongest coercion. He /itII? He is not to be satisfied with the explanation given in For eign Department telegram of 13th July to the Secretary of State, To begin with the appointment of a Turkish Agent is clearly a modification of the status quo. Secondly the Shaikh is him self Turkish representative in his capacity of Turkish Kaim- akam as urged in my telegram No. 690 dated July 1912. If that cannot be maintained then the difficulty could perhaps be surmounted by the Shaikh specifically entrusting supervision of Turkish cases and interests to one of his sons asmmSir- I venture to think that the present anxious situation at Katif and Busreh affords us a most convenient opening for warning Turks that in view of present outlook it would seem most important to get negotiations completed as soon as possible in terms satisfactory to all parties and conversely that it would be most unwise to hostilise Shaikh Mubarak ^ust now. I earnestly hope that some device will be sought by which this article can be circumvented or eliminated. Cox. Cofs-i a-04/-. /Vo.

J C/&gt;^ diA/tfasyx tL, j cr L AThIs document is the 'property of His Majesty's Government. Bagdad Railway and Persian Gulf. The Negotiations with Hakki Pasha. REPORT. For the last mouth or so the undersigned have met Hakki Pasha twice a week at the Foreign Office to discuss the various questions arising out of the British memorandum of 18th July 1912. I. The Shat-el-Arab arrangement presented no great difficulties except in matters of form. In Article 5 Hakki Pasha laid stress on the appointment of Turkish ' ad joints ' ; as they will have no special authority they will be unobjectionable. We have secured that the two chief officials shall be not only British but selected from candidates recommended by His Majesty's Government. Article tig was inserted by Hakki Pasha in order to cover the rights of the Bagdad Railway Company to construct a port at Basra. Articles 7 and 8 are the upshot of much discussion. We wanted the judicial powers of the Commission to be wider—in fact we wanted it to be constituted a court of first instance for all purposes. But Hakki Pasha could not agree to this, and as it appears that the Danube Commission now has no larger powers than those given by Articles 7 and 8, it did not seem politic to insist. The great object is that the local authorities should have as little opportunity as possible for thwarting the Commission, and that seems to be sufficiently assured. Article 11.—Ilakki Pasha was most unwilling to accept the maximum due, but we insisted, to some extent meeting him by Article 16, which, in effect, provides for a reconsideration of the limit in certain circumstances. Article 13.—We had proposed that the advance should be made by the two Governments, in order to be sure that some other Power did not step in. But Hakki Pasha was anxious that it should be the Turkish Government only, and the words ' apres entente avec le Gouvernernent Sa Majeste Britannique ' sufficiently serve our purpose. Article 14 presented considerable difficulty to Hakki Pasha, who wanted the Commission's budget to be voted annually by the Turkish Parliament. This had to be strongly resisted. Article 19 was much discussed as regards police, whom Hakki Pasha wished to be lent by the Turkish Government. This would not secure them sufficient independence, and had to be resisted. A separate declaration provides that the Sheikh of Mohammera may entrust his interests to one of the Commissioners, meaning, of course, the British Commissioner. It will be necessary to supplement this by an agreement with the Sheikh binding him, his heirs and successors, to select the British Commissioner for the purpose. ! s. 204. B (2-1- Ji «■ L.IL As regards Koweit and the Persian Gulf, Hakki Pasha produced a connterdraft to onrs, which, though it contained objectionable features, we accepted as a basis for discussion. Article 1.—Turkish and British views were irreconcilable on the question of ' suzerainty ' and ' sovereignty,' but as the important thing is the rights actually secured for Koweit and renounced by Turkey iu the rest of the convention, and as ' suzerainty ' is itself not a wholly unambiguous term, we agreed, in return for satisfactory definitions in the subsequent mtides, to omit either term, and to say that Koweit ' est un Caza autonome de l Empire Ottoman.' In Article 2 Hakki Pasha laid stress on the Ottoman flag, and we accepted it, subject to the Sheikh s right to mark it with a spoc lal (lo\ice. 1 Ins lias been wanted locally for many years past, but the Sheikh uas &lt;ili&lt;iul of Turkish displeasure. The formula ' Le Gouvernement Ottoman s'abstiendra de toute immixtion dans les affaires de Koweit, y compris la question de la succession' was the result of much discussion. Hakki Pasha desired to say ' les affaires interieurcs,' to which we insisted on adding 'et exterieures,' without which neither the omission of reference to suzerainty or sovereignty nor the right to locate a Turkish agent at Koweit would be safe. Rather than accept this, Hakki Pasha would omit ' interieures et exterieures ' altogether, and we agreed to this subject to the signature of a separate secret note defining ' affaires ' as ' interieures et exterieures.' To this note Hakki desired to add that the Sheikh had not the right to conclude treaties {traife). In his counterdraft he had had a clause to the effect that the Sheikh could not in future conclude political agreements with foreign powers, and that economic agreements would require the sanction of the Turkish Government; but we had struck this out. We agreed to the addition to the note, with the insertion of the words ' contraire a la present,e convention.' It is improbable that we shall ever again want to make a political treaty with Koweit which would conflict with the convention so long as the Turks observe it. The word 'traite ' would not, presumably, cover a lease of land ; but even that we are unlikely to want. Hakki Pasha further claimed to regulate the succession in the Sheikh's family. This we objected to, partly because it admitted Turkish interference, partly because it is contrary to British policy to recognise any but the de facto inlei. Ihe formula which Hakki was induced to accept—that the Turks will name the successor a kaimmakam—is innocuous. In respect of Avticle 3 we were in some doubt as to whether the Biitish right of pre-emption over certain lands (including W arba Island), given by the lease -agreement of 1907, should be specifically mentioned in the Convention. We were both agreed that it w^ould be very impolitic to introduce it at the eleventh hour unless it was absolutely necessary. It seemed to be unnecessary for three reasons, (a) It was carefully considered last summer what should be communicated to the Turks, and neither Sir P. Cox nor the Government of India, nor the India Office, nor the Foreign Office, then suggested men tioning the right of pre-emption. (6) The wording of the Convention is very vague; 'la validite des concessions de terrains.' If the area of the ground leased had been defined, the Turks might have accused us of bad faith if it were afterwards to appear that we had rights over other ground ; as it is, we might have leased the whole of Koweit. (c) Now that Warbaand the adjacent territory is formally secured to Koweit, while the railway is only to be continued to Koweit on conditions to be agreed to by us, the right of pre-emption loses much of its importance, its object having been to prevent the terminus of the railway from falling into foreign hands. We finally decided not to raise the question. Article 4.—Hakki Pasha was very anxious to have a re-assertion of Lord Lansdowne's assurances of 1901, and there seemed no substantial objection to making it. Articles 5 and 7.—It seemed advisable to make the concession recognising two kinds of Koweit territory, and in return for it we got a rectification of our original southern border, so as to include Anta'a. Warba and Bubiyan, of course, were difficult for him to surrender, but we insisted. Article G secures for all practical purposes the same autonomy for the Sheikh in the larger as in the smaller area. We refused to allow a right of way for Turkish troops. In Article 8 Hakki Pasha tried to commit us to Turkish protection for the line and Furkish customs. The wording adopted leaves all such questions open, while making their ultimate solution subject to British approval. Articles 10-13 evict the Turks completely from Bahrein and El Katr. In exchange we give them the island of Zakhnuniya (for which, however, they will pay the Sheikh of Bahrein 1,000Z.) and a small strip of coast. The safeguards required by the Government of India have been secured. We undertake not to annex Bahrein (but not, as Hakki Pasha desired, to abstain from altering the nature of our relations with it), and we undertake that the Sheikh of Bahrein shall not annex El Katr. III. In the declaration regarding the frontier near Mohammera a slight • concession was made (after consultation with Sir P. Cox) in the northern part of the line, which will start at Um Chir and leave Kuskh-i-Basri to Turkey. On the Shat itself there was a direct conflict of opinion between Hakki Pasha and ourselves as to what the status quo is, he maintaining that the territory between Diaiji and the Kahr Xazaileh is in effective Turkish occupation, while we maintained the contrary. Finally he accepted our line with the proviso that if, on delimitation, it is found that the territory in question was in effective Turkish occupation on 1st January last, the line shall be rectified accordingly. There is very little likelihood that this will prove to be the case, but it may be noted that, even if it does, we get a rather better line than that given by the Mediating Commissioners in 1850, which left the Sheikh of Mohammera's palace at Failiyeh in Turkish territory. His Majesty's Government have, of course, to secure Persian acceptance of the line. I\ . The British Memorandum of 18th July 1912 enclosed a draft convention on railway matters, but Hakki Pasha propounded a counter draft. This was quite unacceptable, and the Board of Trade prepared an alternative, whicli Hakki Pasha eventually accepted with some alterations (also prepared by Board of Trade) designed to avoid frequent disputes involving arbitration. Sir H. Llewellyn Smith took part in the discussion on this subject, and it is understood that he considers the result as satisfactory as any document is/ likely to be. Some additional safeguard against unfair differentiation in rates will be afforded by the presence of British directors on the Board. Altera tions in rates, according to Hakki Pasha, require the sanction of the Turkish Government, and it should be possible for the British directors to warn His Majesty's Government if any alteration adversely affecting British trade is proposed ; but too much stress must not be laid on this, since it has been impossible to provide that the directors shall actually be nominees of His Majesty's Government. V. Navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early stage Hakki Pasha threw out the suggestion of an amalgamation of all existing interests into one Turkish Company. We did not at the moment encourage the idea ; but as time went on it was evident that other pai'ties were moving and negotiations proceeding, and the Board of Trade and India Office inde pendently arrived at the conclusion that our interests could best be secured by an amalgamation on terms which there was good reason to think that the Turks might accept. We accordingly informed Hakki Pasha that we thought we could meet his wishes in this matter, and put forward a draft convention which the Board of Trade had prepared. The Turkish Govern ment have made counter proposals which seem to accord in principle with ours, and the question is still under consideration. 3rd May 1913. r\A nnexe I.

IN compliance with the request which, under instructions from your Government, you were good enough to make to me on the 16th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of the agreements concluded by His Majesty's Government with the Trucial chiefs of Oman and the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit, to which reference is made in the memorandum communicated to your Highness on the 29th July last. With respect to these agreements His Majesty's Government have the following observations to make :— As regards No. 1, His Majesty's Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement. His Majesty's Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty's Government reserve to themselves the right toi interpret that term at their discretion. His Majesty's Government hold, moreover, a lease of land from the Sheikh of Koweit. As regards No. 4, His Majesty's Government take occasion to remind the Sublime Porte that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, and transmitted herewith to the Ottomian Government, but on the custom, consent, and long-established relations between the local chiefs and the Government of India. His Majesty's Government hope that in the communication of these agreements, together with the supplementary declarations which are hereby brought to the notice of the Ottoman Government, the Sublime Porte will see proof of His Majesty s Government's goodwill and desire to facilitate the conclusion of the negotiations set forth in their above-mentioned memorandum.

V/ith regard to the objections raised 'by the Shaikh, the Foreign Office do not at present desire to address any commu- nication to the Ottoman Governments You should see that it is clearly impressed upon the Shaikh that he is not being sac- rificed in return for any quid pro quo, but that on the contrary what is being demanded of him is part of the price he must pay in return for the permanent establishment, on a treaty basis, of his position, and the recognition of his ample claims. In addition to this also, in view of the fact that the Turks have undertaken not to interfere in the suc cession or external and internal affairs of Koweit, that an Agent of His Majesty's Government will be located there, and that as long as ho keeps his engagements v /ith us, he ^ . .. j.. . p ii- T-- ., r imn i--■ 'I 1 '* •■■ii^ ■*'' ** is formally assured of our support.

Having done my best to reassure the Shaikh I l«ft and despatched my first telegram to Fao. 4. On the following day the Shaikh came to see me with particular reference to our conversation described above. I was surprised as he was not very well at the time and even if in good health he seldom returns an informal visit on the following day. He had evidently been considering what I had told him and had realised that, though his refusal to accept a Turkish official in Kuwait might be sincere enough and couched in the most emphatic terms, he would be unable to persist in that refusal should the British Gov ernment have accepted the principle of representation and should the Porte demand its fulfilment. On this occasion the Shaikh first reiterated his previous arguments, every whit as vehemently, then he pointed out that Colonel Meade's Agreement of January 1899 was framed with the sole purpose of preventing what we now suggested as likely to come about, viz., the advent of foreign officials in Kuwait. Further, w r e had expressly named the Turkish Government, as one it was particularly desirable to exclude from Kuwait, in the lease agreement for Bandar Shweikh, concluded in October 1907. Besides at our suggestion he had repeatedly rejected German over tures though in doing so he was forfeiting the increase in his Customs revenue which a German firm established in Kuwait would undoubtedly have contributed. He urered that he had faithfully observed his part of a bargain, which was now 14 years old, and had agreed willingly to it, because he realised its advantages to himself as well to us and all he desired was that the exclusion of foreigners might continue as heretofore. The Stiaikh then enquired what had been decided with regard to the Baghdad Railway, in reply to which I gave him the gist of what had appeared in the news tele- grams, observing that I had no official confirmation. The Shaikh evidently had at the back of his mind that his interests had been used by us in some bargain with the Turks, for he asked whether the settlement with the Porte only concerned Kuwait and himself or other Gulf questions and the Baghdad Railway. I replied that I fancied probably an agreement had been reached on all questions, for that was indicated by the news telegrams, though what I had received from the Residency related only to v Kuwait. He was exceedingly perturbed by the idea of having to accept a Turkish official and reverted to the subject again and again saying there was no need to agree to that item, as the Turks were a beaten and weak nation now, apart from the fact that they never have had a representative in the place; the only occasion on which they attempted to force one upon him, a quarantine official some years before the establishment of the British Political Agency, he had turned the man out summarily. He went on to point out that from what I had told him, he failed to see why any concession need have been made to the Porte, he was content to remain as he was, his authority in the desert could not be disputed by the Turks, he was not and never had been subject to them, his position as $&lt; Buler of Kuwait and Chief of its tribes ' was not disputed, and if the Turks liked to address him as 44 Kaimakam ' or by any other title, that did not alter the fact as he never so subscribed himself. He had the very strongest objections to the residence of a Turkish official in Kuwait, and he begged me to telegraph again, placing a special boat at my disposal for the despatch of the telegram. 6. I have given the conversations in some detail in order that the Shaikh's attitude may be fully understood. To me his attitude is no surprise, and whenever the opportunity has occurred, I have endeavoured to present the local view, for it seemed important, seeing that these negotiations have been conducted without the Shaikh having been given any idea as to their course, that we should avoid concessions of a nature likely or calculated to disturb ourown relations with the Shaikh and thereby affect our interests here detriment ally. In my letter No. 8 C. of the 30th April 1913, I attempted to forecast the manner in which the Draft Agreement of the 26th March was likely to be received and in the light of the Shaikh's objections as now formulated, when for the first time he has been given some idea of the terms of the proposed agreement, I would invite a reference to the last three paragraphs of that letter. 6. Though I fear it is probably too late now to hope for any material alteration in whatever may be the terms of the final draft of the Agreement, I feel compelled to record my conviction as to the probable effect of any agree ment which does not contain most of the emendations I have already ventured to submit, and more especially which does not provide for the exclusion of Turkish officials from Kuwait. There has been a growing tendency for some years on the part of Arabs to believe that the Christian Powers are determined to reduce Islamic nations to impotence, and the tendency has received no small impetus from the two wars in which Turkey has recently been engaged. The idea is reflected in the Egyptian Press, it is encouraged in the Ottoman Press, and is not absent from Muhammadan newspapers in India. So far as I have been able to ascertain, this idea has not yet crystallized generally into an accusation definitely anti- British, though indications in that direction have not been wanting; in Kuwait the Shaikh more than any one else has combatted anti-British notions of this kind and has always held up the British Government as the only one which could be trusted to keep its word, deal even-handed justice, not to discriminate between the religious beliefs of its subjects and not to oppress the weak. Nevertheless the power which cheap newspapers, whose very nnmes were unknown in Kuwait ten years ago, can exercise on ignorant minds inclined to believe that all Arabic prmt i/( gospel is considerable, and I venture to tiiink much under-rated by u?, who are in the habit of estimating at its true value what is purveyed by various organs, and the effect is undoubtedly noticeable in Kuwait to-day. At the same time there is not one Kuwaiti in a thousand who would prefer to be a Turkish rather than a British subject if he were now offered the choice. Most Kuwaitis have had sutficiently intimate dealings with Turks and their officials to thank God that their own Ruler is in fact independent and under the protection of the British Governmeut; I have had as much expressed to me time and again, the moral being pointed frequently by a grateful reference to our action in past times in landing British blue-jackets for the defence of Kuwait and in the summary dismissal of Turkish men-of-war when they appeared in Kuwait harbour. Consequently local general opinion has accepted as a settled fact that Kuwait is on the way eventually to become a British protected state similar to Bahrain, that formal pronouncement of that position would probably be deferred until the death of Shaikh Mubarak, and that all things considered the position is about as good as could be secured particularly as it would continue and confirm Kuwait's present freedom from Turkish interference and the attentions of venal Turkish officials. 7. While the above may not appear germane to the Anglo-Turkish Agreement, it may serve to show the general attitude of the people and the Buler, who are the most nearly affected by that Agreement. The Agreement, as it stands in the Draft, will in reality give nothing whatsoever to the Ruler of Kuwait or his people which they have not enjoyed for years, while to them it will appear—owing to the clause permitting a resident Turkish Agent—rather as a formal delivery of Kuwait into the hands of Turkey by the Power which has hitherto safeguarded them from the menaces of that very Power. I confess even I find it difficult to avoid some such conclusion when the Agreement contains clauses (a) acknowledging Turkish suzerainty, hitherto disputed, (b) permitting a Turkish official in Kuwait, hitherto strenuously opposed, (&lt;?) maintaining Turkish military posts, hitherto protested against as encroachments, (d) circumscribing boundaries hitherto unquestioned and actually maintained, and (e) recognising the Ruler of Kuwait as a Turkish official, hitherto denied. In the effort to reconcile the Agreement, should it materialise as proposed, with the actually existing position, the Shaikh and his people will ask themselves the inevitable question ' what has induced the4 British Government to make this agreement concerning us, so seriously to our detriment, and that too when Turkey is of no account in the world ? ' The answer locally is obvious, viz., that Kuwait has been made use of by the British Government to obtain something else, a recognition of other claims elsewhere, a concession in regard to the Baghdad Railway, and the like. When it is remembered further that the Ruler of Kuwait has not been con sulted during the negotiations, has not been informed as to their course, and is to be presented with a fait accompli of some such description, I submit it is not unreasonable to expect the deepest disappointment and resentment at our action. How that resentment will affect our future relations I am loathe to contemplate, but I feel sure that its effect will not be merely local—it will affect us along the whole Arabian littoral of the Persian Guff by shaking the confidence which our support has hitherto inspired. No amount of explanation will ever remove the impression that we have used Kuwait as a pawn to secure other advantages for ourselves, more especiallv if some such advantages later become manifest, as, for instance, a settlement in our favour of the Baghdad Railway question. 8. It may be said I have exaggerated the probable disappointment, and overrated its possible effect. It may be so but with over four years* ex perience of Kuwait, its Ruler and its people, with whom the discussion of high politics on the mischievous lines supplied by the vernacular press occupies almost their whole leisure, I feel it to be my duty even at this late hour to endeavour to obtain some reconsideration of what appears to be almost a com pleted document, when that document seems calculated to destroy with a stroke of the pen a position which we have been at no small expenditure of energy and money to consolidate in Kuwait, particularly, during the last ten years or more. rorcign Office Press—No, 21—19-6-18—IS.Telegram - P # From - Secretary of State for India, London.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence regarding the Anglo-Turkish negotiations relating to the status of Kuwait, ending with the Government of India telegram in the .Foreign Department, No. 63 S., dated the 15th April 1913. 2. You are aware that I returned to headquarters on the 21st April to find Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah dangerously ill. He is now recovering slowly, but I have not found it possible up to date to say more on the subject than to state that his letter and enclosure to your address had been forwarded to Government, that as the conclusion of the war was in sight it was hoped negotiations would soon be actively taken up, and that you have asked Govern ment to keep you informed as to their course; also that I did not consider4 paragraphs appearing in the Basrah papers could give reliable information of matters which were the subject of confidential negotiations between the British and Turkish Governments and on which we had not yet received a pronounce ment from Government. 3. On one occasion, when I visited the Shaikh before I had received copies of Foreign Office print No. 12978, dated the 26th March, your tel^fjram No. G37 of the 3rd April, and Foreign Department telegram referred to above, the Shaikh mentioned that he received news from Basrah to the effect that the British and Turkish Governments had agreed upon Kuwait autonomy and that he was perfectly satisfied for all his claims had bee i recognized. The Shaikh's condition then bein? serious, I snid no more than that I doubted the authenticity of his information or that the Porte could have receded so completely from a position which sometime ago I knew showed a wide divergence from his claims. A few days later I obtained a copy of the ' Dastur ' (published in Basrah) which contained a paragraph in its issue of the 12th Jamadi-al-Awal 1331 (16th April 1913) practically identical with w r hat the Shaikh had told me. I-attach, for information, a rough translation of the paragraph, which, I may add, was also received with as much satisfaction by the Kuwait public as the Shaikh. It will be obvious, however, that this satisfaction is based on a vastly different conception o£. Kuwait autonomy to that disclosed in the draft agreement of the Foreign Office print 12978 of 26th March. I shall, however, take the first opportunity made possible by the Shaikh's improvement in health to prepare him for the fact that he must expect a considerable alteration in his present view of the position. 4. Meanwhile, I venture to submit, for consideration, the following points, trusting that even now it may not be too late to obtain better terms for the Shaikh i As a result of my recent tour I have been able to lay down with some accuracy the position of wells and other features to the south-west of Kuwait by which the Shaikh's southern boundary is determined. The Shaikh claims to include the Al-Gara'a and Al-Haba wells, and all the information I have been able to collect points to the fact that his claim is justly founded. I have attached herewith the confidential ' Map of the Kuwait Hinterland ' with the doubtful portion in the south corrected from my latest tours, and would invite a comparison with the same map uncorrected in your office as likely to be useful. By far the strongest argument in support of the Shaikh's claim, however, is the actual situation of the wells themselves. Taking the Al-liaba wells as a centre and striking a semi-circle of 90 miles radius from east round by south to west discloses the fact that in the whole of the intervening country there is not a single well and that the nearest wells to the southward lie on this semi-circle, viz., —those of Awaina, on the east situate 27 miles south of Anta'a, next those of Hafar-al-Ats, almost due south from Al-Haba, and those of Gaiyiya (at 105 miles), south-west of Al-Haba. It may be taken for granted that nomad Arabs recognise authority in the desert according to wells, and never in all my tours have I heard it suggested that the wells of Hafar, As-Safa, Al-Gara'a, and Al-Haba (all along the Shaikh's southern boundary) were not in Kuwait territory and jurisdiction, flow I came to omit the Al-Haba wells from my previous report. No. 62 C., dated the 12th August 1912, I cannot now understand. I have marked in blue, pencil what is undoubtedly the actual boundary on the attached corrected map. As I have traversed personally the whole of this district, obtained my information from Bedouin camping actually on the spot, and myself produced what map there is of the tract, I claim that my opinion is entitled at least to as much weight as the assertions of the Turkish Government, which has no real or first-hand knowledge of the area, facts or conditions as they actually exist. 5. While I am fully aware that an agreement with Turkey regarding Kuwait can be reachea only by compromise, I venture to submit with all deference that it is worth while in our own interests to consider how any compromise is likely to be regarded by the Ruler of Kuwait and his people and its probable effect on our relations. It must be recollected that the Shaikh has not been informed of the course of the negotiations, nor of the Turkishdemands, nor of our suggestions or concessions thereto—he has left his case in our hands with the expectation that we will at least see his just demands Satisfied. Consequently we shall have to bear the odium and any resentment resulting from such disappointment as may follow from the agreement falling short of the Shaikh's expectations. I have shown in previous reports and above what can fairly be considered Kuwait boundaries, and now propose to state what I feel convinced would be the really genuine objections the Shaikh would advance to the draft agreement on Foreign Office print No. 12978, dated 26th March, if it were communicated to him. 6. Taking the draft agreement by articles seriatim— (a) Article 1 may be passed by as without objection. {b) In Article 2 the objection is that the title of Kaimakam is a very inferior one and connotes that Kuwait territory is merely a 'Qadha'. An almost exact parallel would be furnished by calling the Shaikh a Deputy Com missioner or Collector under the Indian Government and his territory a 'district'. When it is added that a Turkish Kaimakam's annual salary amounts to £1^5 to^£270 only, and the position indicated thereby is contrasted with the fact that the Shaikh has hitherto enjoyed almost complete indepen dence, been accorded a salute of 12 guns by British men-of-war and always been addressed officially as ' Ruler of Kuwait', the depreciation of his position under the draft agreement may be realized in some measures. Further, though Turkish officials address him as Kaimakam and add the title of Pasha, the (Shaikh himself does not acknowledge the style and invariably describes himself as 44 Ruler of Kuwait and Chief of its tribes'. I venture to think that we should stipulate for Kuwait to be described at least as a ' Sanjak ' and its ruler as a ' Mutasserif of which the Indian equivalents would be a Division and a Commissioner. The question of the continuance of a salute to the Shaikh would also seem to be involved in our recognition of whatever Turkish title or rank may be selected. ((?) Article 3 defines complete autonomy sufficiently clearly. (d) Article 4 permits the appointment of a Turkish Agent, and has the most serious objections. The Shaikh has not dreamt of such a possibility, and, I am sure, would object most strongly to the idea. He could doubtless be compelled to receive one, but the pressure would have to be applied through, with the consent of, or perhaps even directly by, the British Government. The effect on our relations with and our interests in Kuwait of forcing the representative of an undesired Power upon an unwilling Ruler and people may be easily imagined. There is further to be reckoned with the inevitable and recurrent intrigues which will result from the residence of a Turkish official .in Kuwait. My own opinion is that the Turkish Agent, if permitted, will either be regarded as a spy by the ruling Shaikh of the time or be utilized by him in intrigues and efforts to play off the Turkish and British Govern ments against each other for his own ends. {e) Articles 5, 6, 7 require to be considered together with the map. In the first place, the division of his territory into two portions, over which he and the Turkish Government will have authority different in degree and kind, will be unintelligible to the Sheikh and will moreover lead to constant friction, for the inner segment defined in Article 6 has no naturally definable boundary and is a paper arrangement which the Shaikh will be unable to maintain in the exercise of his authority throughout the whole of the two portions over which at present it is identical in character. Secondly, the su^ested difference will furnish the Bedouin tribes subject to the Shaikh and the Turkish authorities with endless opportunities for petty intrigue and friction, particularlv if permission for a Turkish Agent as suggested in Article 4 is accorded. Assum*- ing the best intentioos on the part of the Turkish Government and its officials, intrigue remains as the breath of life to Bedouin, and the suggested division of his territory will undoubtedly hamper the Ruler of Kuwait in his dealings with the tribes. I would suggest that the Shaikh's complete autonomy as defined in Article 3 should extend to the limits described in Article 7, modified so far as may be considered possible by the information I have given above in para graph 4. The alternative southern boundary given in a starred foot-note toArticle 7 is usolesa from the Shaikh's point of view for reasons already given in paragraph 4 above, and moreover is not desired by him. In this conneetion it would seem desirable that the evacuation of the Turkish posts on Bubian Island and Um Kasr should be ensured either by the present agreement, or, if preferred, separately if that at Safvvan is allowed to rem in. It will be clear from reports ever since the occupation of these posts in 1902 that the Shaikh would have taken measures to eject the Turks but for beinj? restrained by .British assurances that we had not lost sighr of the matter. The stipulations in Article 6 prohibiting Turkey from stationing garrisons or taking military or naval action within Kuwait boundaries should be maintained. ff) Article 8 requires no comment. [y) Article 9 requires no comment beyond that I believe the Shaikh hns already succeeded in obtaining legal recognition for his landed properties in that permission is said to have been granted for their registration in his own name without the formality of-taking out a Turkish ' natas tnzkireh {h) Article 10 would, I am certnin, be most strongly opposed by the Shaikh for the reasons given in Residency telegram No. 602, dated the 28th March 1913. If some such clause is strongly pressed for, it might be worded s.. as to permit the passage of Turkish troops to Nejd by no route nearer to Kuwait than the caravan road passing along the western boundary from Bas« - ah, by the Hatin depression to Hafar wells. 7. Though the foregoing may be said to be largely destructive criticism of the draft agreement, I have endeavoured to show how that agreement may be made somewhat less unpalatable to the Shaikh. Unpalatable it will be and will remain for years even with the emendations I have suggested, but it seems to me that in treating with the Turkish Government we have hardly given the Shaikh's irrefutable rights the consideration due to them, for his claim has throughout been founded on a just minimum of existing facts which we have been at some pains to investigate ourselves, whilst in our desire to meet the Porte wp have shown a benevolent sympathy to their vague, extravagant and nebulous claims, unsupported ?s they are by nny real evidence, which they do not merit. That we may obtain a quid pro quo elsewhere does not affect Kuwait for the Sheikh will judge the agreement as it touches himself and his people and inasmuch as he has left his whole case unreservedly in our hands he will be the more inclined to resent any serious diminution of his territory, prestige, rights or privileges. The whole force of such resent- rm nt will certainly recoil upon us, more especially were the idea to obtain that we had benefited in some other sphere, and it is because I feel so strongly that the advent of any bitterness in our very cordial relations wiih the Ruler of Kuwait should be avoided as far as may be possible that I have ventured to submit, the above paragraphs for consideration. Shaikh Mubarak has been far more loyal and straightforward in his dealings with us than we could have anticipated from an oriental chief of so little education, and therefore merits the most benevolent consideration of his claims at our hands, more particulary when we are negotiating regarding them practically without consulting him, the party most interested.

THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY. HAKKI PASHA'S JMISSION. TJRESENT STATE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS. When Hakki Pasha arrived in London in February last it was stated in The Times that he had come to reopen the discussion between Great Britain and Turkey on the many ques tions connected with the Persian Gulf which were in need of settlement. During the last few days there has been a plethora of telegrams in the Press from Constantinople, Paris, Berlin, and other places giving more or less distorted accounts of the present position of the negotia tions. Some of these accounts have been exag gerated and are mischievous in their tendency ; and it may be useful to state the true facts of the case, so far as they can be gleaned from a collation of the various reports in the light of the previous history of the question and the well-known policy of his Majesty's Government- It is clear that so far no definite agreement has been signed. It is equally clear that a number of Conventions have been prepared by Hakki Pasha and the representatives of the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Board of Trade with whom he has been in negotiation, and that others are in course of preparation. When the negotiations are concluded the whole agreement will go to the British Cabinet and to the Porte for confirmation. The object of these Conventions, from the point of view of the Turkish Govern, ment, is to remove the British objections to the proposed increase in the Turkish Customs duties. Those objections have been twofold. It was felt that Great Britain could not consent to the imposition of fresh burdens on British trade so long as the Turkish authorities were working to undermine the position which Great Britain had built up in the Persian Gulf. It was felt, too, that indirectly, if not directly, the new revenue would be used to facilitate the construction of the Baghdad Railway and its prolongation to the head of the Gulf. As matters stood the completion of the line was likely to be detri mental to British interests, both political and commercial. The increase in the Customs dues had therefore to be vetoed unless and until British interests were protected by some binding agreement. The Persian Guu'. We may take it for granted—and indeed it has been explicitly stated—that, in the Conventions already prepared for signature, the respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the Persian Gulf have been defined in a way to put an end to the existing friction. From the various reports which have appeared i of this section of the agreement it seems certain that-— (1) Great Britain recognizee 'Che suzerainty ; -of the Porte over Koweit which is to be an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire. (2) The Porte engages not to interfere in the internal affairs of Koweit or in the question of the succession, and explicitly recognizes the validity of the conventions concluded between the Sheikh and the British Government. (3) The Porte abandons its pretensions to suzerainty over the peninsula of El Katr, the Bahrein Islands, Muscat, and the territory of t/AJUC/ w-. (4) The Porte recognizes the right of Great Britain to undertake, in the future as in the past, the duty of lighting, buoying, and policing the Gulf. The Baghdad Railway. The necessity of safeguarding the autonomy, under British influence, of the Sheikh of Koweit implies that the Baghdad Railway cannot be brought down to Koweit. Some of the Con stantinople telegrams state categorically that the terminus of the railway is to be at Basra, and this we may accept as certainly true. It is equally clear that Great Britain does not claim any share in the construction of the line between Baghdad and Basra. Under existing conditions she would only be able to participate on equal terms with Gennany, France, and Russia, to say nothing of Turkey. British trading interests are probably better safe guarded by stringent provisions against any preferential tariffs or facilities. A further safeguard, mentioned by our Constantinople Correspondent on Thursday, is that Great Britain is to be represented by two directors on the board of the Baghdad Railway, which is apparently to resume its right of construc ting this section. Various French reports - have spoken of special arrangements with regard to the pro jected Baghdad-Khanikin branch, which is to connect the railway with the future Persian system. They may safely be disregarded. Any special arrangement of this kind would be out of harmony with the spirit of the agree ment. The general provisions for ensuring equality of treatment for British goods will, of course, apply to this important trade artery, together with the rest of the Baghdad system. In regarding the progress of the Baghdad Railway with a more friendly eye Great Britain will be following the example of Russia. It will be remembered that, by the Potsdam Agreement of August, 1911, the Russian Government, in return for j stipulations safeguarding Russian interests, agreed not to place any difficulties in the way of the scheme. The French Government, whose interests lie in other parts of the Otto man Empire, have been kept informed of the trend of the negotiations. As French capital is strongly engaged in the Baghdad Railway, any agreement facilitating its progress can only ; be welcome in France, Germany is, of course, more closely concerned than any other Power, and the definite com pletion of the arrangement with Turkey will probably be followed by negotiations between London and Berlin. There appears to have already been some conversation on the subject, 1 and it is clear that an agreement on the lines i indicated ought not to be difficult. Closely connected with the question of the Baghdad Railway is that of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates, with regard to which Great Britain possesses certain rights and privileges. It is unlikely that the negotiations will come to an end without an agreement being reached defining and maintaining thoseM ^ i '7 i ^ ^ British Negotiations with Turkey. Many rumours have been published during the last few days regarding the reported con clusion of agreements between Great Britain and Turkey, These rumours have not all been accurate, but the statement which we publish elsewhere suffices to indicate that various causes of difierence between Great Britain and Turkey, at the head of the Persian Gulf and elsewhere, are on the verge of being adjusted. Nothing has yet been signed, but upon most points in dispute a basis of settlement appears to have been reached. The negotiations which are now drawing to a close have been very protracted. They were reopened early last year, and although the Tripoli and Balkan i wars caused a temporary interruption, they were never afterwards entirely suspended. The discussions originated in a proposal that Great Britain should agree to the proposed increase in the Turkish Customs dues and should participate in the construction and control of the last section of the Baghdad Rail way, between Baghdad and the sea. It soon, became plain that before this suggestion could be entertained there was much preliminary ground to be cleared. Great Britain and Turkey had long been at variance upon many questions connected with the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia. There wat*-&lt;li»eord regard ing such delicate matters as the status of Koweit, the navigation of the Shatt-al-Arab and the Tigris, the southern portion of the Turco-Persian frontier, and the relations maintained by Turkey with certain portions of the Gulf coast of Arabia. The out come of the war made it more than ever necessary to strengthen the financial posi tion of Turkey. It became manifest that if, as Great Britain hoped, Turkey was to repair her fortunes by strengthening and developing her position in Asia Minor, she would require financial aid. If the other Powers interested signify their assent, that aid will now be forthcoming, because it is proposed to permit a further increase in the Turkish Customs duties. Turkey, on her part, will in return facihtate the settlement of the disputes between herself and Great Britain. None of the causes of friction have any relation to the well-being of Turkey. She has nothing to gain by keeping the Turco-Persian frontier question as an open sore, by stationing small squads of soldiers within the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit , by obstructing British rights of navigation on Mesopotamian rivers, or by seeking to maintain Midhat Pasha's illusory claims to widespread Turkish interests in Eastern Arabia. The policy thus implied has been a source of weakness rather than of strength, and it has hindered the proffer of British help in overcoming the larger difficulties of the Turkish Empire. The primary object of Great Britain has always been to safeguard her special posi tion in the Persian Gulf, which has been the subject of repeated Ministerial declarations. British anxiety was chiefly directed towards the important harbour of Koweit. We have rela tions with the Sheikh of Koweit , duly ratified by agreements which have been in existence for a considerable number of years. Turkey has not hitherto recognized the validity of these agreements, and has put forth claims regarding Koweit which we have pronounced excessive. An amicable method of composing these long standing differences appears to have been de vised. Its salient features are that Great Britain will recognize Koweit as autonomous territory within the Turkish Empire, and will acknow ledge the honorific distinction conferred upon Sheikh Mubarak by the Suxtan ; while Turkey will undertake to abstain from inter ference with the aftairs of Koweit, will accept a specified boOndary, and will abide by the t^rriH of the British agreements with the Sheikh. A long and irritating quarrel will thus be settled on terms which should be acceptable to all con cerned- Another section of the coming agreement will, it is stated, settle the question of British navigation rights on the waterways of Meso- potamia. Turkey will further, it is expected. (I3T) recognize the work undertaken oy uretu, x&gt;ntain regarding the lighting, buoying, and policing of the Persian Gulf ; she will no longer seek to intrude in the Arabian peninsula of El Katr ; and she will bring to a close the uncer tainty about the line of the Turco-Pereian frontier. It should be understood that on both sides these conclusions are tentative, but we trust that the final formalities will not be long delayed. There remains the question of the Baghdad Railway, which lies at the back of the negotia- I tions already note\l. The chief concern of Great Britain has been to take care that her trade shall not be subjected to discriminating treat ment when the line is open. Probably this end will be secured by the appointment of two British directors who will share in the control j of the line. If this proposal is accepted, and if the guarantees of fair treatment are ful filled, Groat Britain will have no further reason for looking askance at a project which should do much for the development of Asiatic Turkey. Our interests will be amply safe guarded ; we have always said that a terminus at Basra offered no menace to specific British interests in the Persian Gulf; and the German promoters will be free to complete their great project with the benevolent acquiescence of Great Britain. There will be no official British participation in the construction of the line, but there will also be nothing to deter British capital from being associated with the scheme. We believe that if some such solution is adopted a fertile source of international misunderstand ing will disappear. It is a solution which should receive the approval of France and Russia, and should give gratification to Germany. It appears to leave no room for subsequent differences of view, while it wipes out a whole series of obscure disputes. It will be a further demonstration of that spirit of co-operation among the Great Powers which has done so much of late to preserve the peace of Europe. It should convince Germany that Great Britain does not oppose the assential elements of the Baghdad Railway scheme, provided her own special interests are pro tected. Above all, it will relieve the financial disabihties of Turkey, and will enable her to press forward the task of binding with bands of steel the great Asiatic territories in which her future chiefly lies. IMPERIAL AND FOREIGN, The Baghdad Railway. The negotiations between Hakki Pasha and the British Government for a complete settle ment of pending questions regarding the ; Baghdad Railway and the Persian Gulf are now in a very advanced state. Several conventions dealing with British and Turkish interests in the Gulf, the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab, and the Baghdad Railway are already drawn up and others are expected to be completed in a few days. Nothing has been signed yet, as the agreements are ad referendum. The North-German Gazette published last night a communique dealing with the question of the negotiations, (pp. 7 and 8)BELGIUM OLD NEW. till.—GHENT AND EXHIBITION. THE (fbom our special correspondent.) In the great plain of Eastern Flanders there is a point where the Scheldt takes a sharp turn from north to east, and where it is joined by the Lys and two other rivers. To command this meeting of the waterways a fortress was built as early as the ninth century. Three centuries later the sturdy weavers and towns men of the place had already become so un manageable that Philip of AJsace, Count of Flanders, rebuilt the fortress in the hope of overawing his subjects. His castle stands there to this day in the city of Ghent. Cleared of surrounding houses and carefully main tained, it tells, in its very beauty, not loss than by its darkness and coldness, its prisons and its monstrous walls, of all the barbarity, the cruelty, and the force of its era. It did not need the relics of the Inquisition, there preserved, to make it a place to shudder in. Yet, fearful as it is, it was not strong enough for the people of Ghent, who, doubtless loving a fight for its own sake, were ready to fight any one who attempted to rule them. They beat our Edward I. ; a few years later, at the famous *• Battle of the Spurs,' near Courtrai, they joined with the men of Bruges in beating the best of French chivalry.

PERSIAN GULF QUESTION. THE PROTECTION OF INTERESTS. GERMAN » (from our own correspondent.) BERLIN, May 16. The North-German Gazette publishes the following Communique to-night:— The negotiations begun two years ago between England and Turkey about the questions of the Persian Gulf have, during the past weeks, been brought near to their conclusion. The German interests affected hereby arise in the main out of the German participation in the Baghdad Railway. In March, Iflll, upon the occasion of the conclusion of the financial agreements about the continuation of the Railway to Baghdad, and upon the occasion of the grant of the concession for the branch line to Alexandretta, and for the harbour of Alexandre^tA, the German group, which holds the leading position in the Baghdad Railway undertaking, opened the road for a Turco-British agreement, in so far as the interests and rights of the Baghdad Railway Com pany come into consideration. It did so in correct appreciation of the fact that an agreement l)ctween England and Turkey about the long-disputod questions the Persian Gulf and in connexion therewith an tgreement between Germany and England regarding be economic questions connected with the Baghdad Railway will remove a serious obstacle to the com pletion of this work of civilization and will in a high degree promote the great economic purpofes which alone have from the German side from the beginning beeji pursued in this undertaking. The German group then declared its agreement in principle with the whole or partial transference to a new Turkish company, capitalized internationally, of those rights conceded to the Baghdad Railway Company, which ■refer to the territory south of Baghdad. The condi tions for this transference and the settlement of all details were expressly reserved as matter for future Agreements between the Turkish Government and the Baghdad Railway Company. In so far as the agreement between England and TTrrrkcy that has been attempted upon the ba^is of this declaration affects the interests and rights of the Baghdad Railway, the agreement can be completed only with the consent of the Baghdad Railway Company and—in view of the great importance of this economic undertaking—only with the agreement of the German Government. The German Government and the interested Com- pany are kept au courant of the Anglo-Turkish negotiations. The course of these negotiations thus \ far justifies the assumption that from the German side adso the result can be accepted as a satisfactory solution. Before, however, the interested German parties and the German Government can give their consent a further exchange of views will be requisite, by means of which the German interests may be pro tected indisputably, and equivalent compensation {gieiehtcerligc Gtgenleistnngen) for any German con cessions (Zugextandnisse) may be secured. About the present state of the matter more cannot be said without disturbance of the negotiations and evidently has not been said by the non-German parties to the negotiations. The announcements which thus far have found their way into the Press are partly incomplete and partly inaccurate, and are therefore not calculated to form the foundation for a criticism of the agreements. Whatever the purpose of this communique may be the form of it does not seem well calcu lated to check Frees discussion, or to promote the settlement thiat all parties ostensibly desire. Roughly speaking, it has hitherto been under stood that Germany, or the Baghdad Railway Company—which are identified in this com- mumque —had already secured ample com pensations for any ' concessions ' in the shape of the new Alexandretta concessions. The heavy hand of the B«mi-official &gt; writer now traces the prospect of further bargainings with the requirement of further ' equivalent com pensations.' The publication of the com munique at this moment seems curious, because except in the journals which are suppoeed to be inspired by the Deutsche Bank, there has been no public outcry here and most people will heartily welcome an immediate settlement. %* An article and a map dealing with the Persian Gulf question will be found on page 8.• // ^^ 7 ~ E.A. k3 » r.»&gt;c 12.^- Wn A copy of the foregoing communicati6n is forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for informa tion, in continuation of the endorsement from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, No .99e -E .A. dated the 8th T r ay 1913, By order, etc. , c ^S Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.

Revised Draft Convention for the establishment of a Shatt-eUArab JSaviga- Hon Commission. The Government of His Britannic Majesty and the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, being desirous on account of the magnitude of their interests in the trade on the Shatt-el-Arah to improve the navigation of that river, and to diminish the risks to which commerce thereon is exposed, have agreed as follows :— 1. The navigation of the Shatt-el-Arah shall remain open to the ships of 1/ all nations. 2. The Imperial Ottoman Government will establish a Commission to discharge the duties connected with the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab from Kurna to the sea, described in Article 6. _— 3. The Commission shall consist of two members only, to be appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government. The Imperial Government desires that one of these two members shall be of British nationality, and will invite His Majesty's Government to suggest candidates from whom they will select' one. 4. Each of the Commissioners shall receive annually a salary of £ T. 2,000 free of all deductions. These salaries sh ill be paid by the Commission. - 5. The Commission shall appoint such officers and employes as may be necessary, but the Imperial Government desire that the Chief Engineer and the Inspector of River Conservancy shall be of British nationalty, and will invite His Majesty's Government to recommend candidates from whom to select. The Commissioners will appoint an Assistant Engineer and an Assistant Inspector of Turkish nationality. The salaries of such officers and employes shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. 6. The Commission shall be charged with the following duties : : — (a) The execution of such works as may be necessary for the improve ment of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (b) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. (c) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the naviga tion of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (d) The control of pilotage. (e) The buoying and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and // control of the lights and buoys in the approaches to the river specified in the Schedule to this Convention. (/) The supervision, so far as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this Convention, and subject to the treaty rights of foreign Powers, of the wharves, quays, docks, and jetties belonging to private persons in or on the banks of the river, and the provision of such additional accommodation and facilities as the Commission may deem necessary. ((/) In the event of a port being established at Basra under any Conven tion binding on the Imperial Government at the present date, the rights in that port secured to the Imperial Government by that Convention and the ' cahier des charges ' shall be exclusively exercised by the Commission in so far as these rights touch the subjects treated in the preceding paragraphs. 7. The Commission shall have power to fix, in any regulations issued by it under Article 6 (c) of this Convention, the fines to be imposed for offences against such regulations. Such offences shall be triable exclusively by the Commission, which shall have, in the case of offences against such regulations, the same power as a municipality to condemn delinquents in fines, and, in the event of such fines not being paid, to the equivalent term of imprisonment under Ottoman law. /50 8. In all other criminal matters arising within the limits of the jurisdic tion of the Commission, the police of the Commission shall have the exclusive power of arrest. The accused will then be handed over to the competent authority for trial, the Commission retaining the right to appear as prosecutor, should it desire to do so, 9. The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider neoessary to enable it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 10. No- dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact of navigation, unless in respect of services rendered. 11. The Commission shall have the sole right to levy such dues or charges as may be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it. Such dues shall not exceed the amount reasonably required for the above purposes, including the administration of the Com mission, and their produce shall be exclusively applied thereto, any surplus being devoted to the reduction of dues. In no case shall the rate of dues exceed 1 fr. per net registered ton of shipping. 12. Any dues or charges levied by the Commission shall be levied impartially and equitably in respect of all vessels, whatever be the places from or to which they arrive or depart, or the nations or persons to which the vessels or their cargoes belong. Similarly there shall be no differentiation in the matter of facilities between vessels or goods of different nations or persons, or between vessels arriving from or departing to different places. 13. Any sums which it may become necessary for the Commission to borrow on capital accounts in connection with carrying out the duties in^osed upon it shall be advanced by the Imperial Ottoman Government alter agreement with His Majesty's Government at a rate of interest not exceeding 5 per cent, per annum. 14. The control of all funds raised and expended by the Commission shall be vested exclusively in the Commission. 15. The Commission shall publish annually complete and accurate accounts, showing the amounts received and expended by it. Such accounts will be subject to audit by the *' Cour des Comptes 16. If the receipts of the Commission are insufficient to cover its ordinary expenditure when the limit mentioned in Article 11 is reached, then the deficit shall be advanced by the Imperial Ottoman Government, pending an agree ment between the two Governments as to the means of restoring financial equilibrium. i.&lt; u ^ 17- In the event of the members of the Commission being unable to agree as to whether any particular works are or are not necessary for the improvement of the Shatt-el-Arab, or as to the way in which particular works should be carried out, the question shall be referred by them to an engineer of repute, to be agreed upon by the Commissioners, or, failing agreement, to be nominated by the two Governments, and the decision of such engineer shall be adopted by the Commission. 18. The Commission shall correspond upon all matters connected with the duties entrusted to it with the Sublime Porte direct, and not through the local authorities. 19. The local authorities shall not interfere in any way with the housrs, buildings, land, or other property of the Commission, or with its funds or with the discharge of their duties by the officers of the police, pilotage, or other services maintained by the Commission, or with wharves, jetties, docks, or quays in or on the banks of the river belonging to private persons.51 declare ne pas s'opposer h ce que le Gouvernement de S.

Sir, I have the honour to report to Your Excellency that, 'owing to reasons connected with the war in the Balkans,' work on the Bagdad Railway has been in a large measure suspended. According to reliable information/work is proceeding only on the tunnels through the Taurus and Amanus. The construction of the portions of the line between Kara Punar and Dorak, and between Mamureh and Raju (near Islahieh) has ceased, and even the works necessary for the upkeep of the line (' Schutzwerke ') are being abandoned. I am informed that 18,000 deunums of land, a few miles north-east of the town of Hamidieh, have recently been acquired by two Germans of Alexandria, Messrs. Stoefiler and Peters. According to my information, this land was bought in 1908 at about 20 piastres a deunum by a Turkish subject, named Raad, actins: on behalf of the Germans. Considerable difficulty was subse quently experienced by the Germans in having the land transferred from Kaad's name to their own. Some hostility has been manifested by local Germans to the Chukur Ova concession (my despatch No. 32 of the 4th October last), but it is now reported that the concession has been confirmed by the Turkish Government.

In reply to your letter No. 14674, of the 9th instant, regarding transport on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he agrees with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it will be difficult to prevent Messrs. Lynch from coming to an arrangement with the Baghdad Railway Company as regards the existing concession; but that, if His Majesty's Government obtain the three additional ships from the Turkish Government and transfer them to Messrs. Lynch, stringent condi tions can presumably be imposed, including the presence of a Government Director on the Board with a power of veto. 2. But below this difficulty lies the fundamental difficulty that the policy of the Baghdad Railway Company, if they get a footing on the river (whether through Messrs. Wonckhaus or otherwise)—which it will be difficult to prevent—will probably be to undercut Messrs. Lynch by quoting through rates on the railway and German ships. This contingency was foreseen w r hen the whole question was under discussion in June last, and it can apparently only be met by similar measures on our part, i e., either by direct subsidy, or by an interworking arrangement between Indian railway com panies and the steamship companies concerned. The Marquess of Crewe w 7 ill obtain the views of the Government of India on this subject, but it w r ill necessarily require careful consideration, and an immediate answer is not to be expected. 3. In the meantime I am to suggest th at th e question of amalgamation should be more closely examined. The parties immediately concerned appear to be the Turkish Government, the Turkish Nahriye Company, and His Majesty's Government (if the view taken in your letter of 26th March is correct), acting through Messrs. Lynch. No foreign power or firm has any permanent rights of navigation, but it should be observed that the temporary Societe des Transports Eluviaux (one-half of whose capital is held by the Baghdad Railway Company, and the other half by Messrs. Lynch) has the right of transporting general merchandise as well as railway material. But this is a right as against Messrs. Lynch, and not as against the Turkish Government. The Turkish Government are now understood to favour the formation of a single Turkish Company, combining all interests, for the navigation of the rivers. But apparently, except for the temporary interest of the Baghdad Railway Company in the Societe above-mentioned, the solo interests are Turkish and British, and the question suggests itself whether the Turkish Government could not be induced to agree to the formation of a Turkish Company, of which half the capital and half the directing Board should be British, His Majesty's64 Government not concerning themselves with the source from which the Turkish capital might be obtained. It was held by the Board of Trade that 50 per cent, participation in the raliway would suffice to prevent measures hostile to our interests, and the same would presumably apply to the river also. If this is impracticable, the only alternative form of amalgamation is one in which hona fide British interests would be in a minority—since Lord Crewe could not regard the National Bank (whose participation has been suggested) as a British concern for the present purpose. But, as it has already been agreed that the maintenance of effective river competition is essential, it is difficult to see how His Majesty's Government could acquiesce in such an amalgamation, and the only means they apparently possess of preventing it is their hold over Messrs. Lynch. As regards this. His Lordship is of opinion that it would be too strong a measure, after all that has taken place, for them to assert their rights as the original concessionaire to prevent Messrs. Lynch from entering the combine. On the other hand, it appears to him that a one-fourth participation could be of so little value to Messrs. Lynch that they could only contemplate entering on those terms with the inten tion of being ultimately bought -out, and this, in his opinion, His Majesty's Government would be fully entitled to prohibit. If this view is correct, the knowledge that it would be prohibited would probably suffice to prevent Messrs. Lynch from entering, or would at all events induce them to disclose their real position. I am accordingly to suggest that if, after consideration of my letter of 7th instant. Sir E. Grey is satisfied that His Majesty's Govern ment are on firm ground, Messrs. Lynch should be at once informed of the view which they take of the concession, and told that in no circumstances will the transfer of British interests be permitted.

Sir, In reply to your letter No. 16335 of the 12th instant, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that the draft agreement respecting railways in Asiatic Turkey proposed by the Sublime Porte appears to him to be merely an elaboration of Article 4 of the British draft, and to leave the rest and most important part, of the ground uncovered. Moreover, so far as it is an elaboration, it seems to be to the detriment of British interests, since it postulates an identity of conditions which could hardly be attained, and certainly not proved, in practice. He cannot, therefore, recommend that it be accepted as a whole. But he observes that the British draft contains no provision to protect goods imported or exported partly by rail and partly by river; and, as a cover for introduc ing such a provision, he would suggest that paragraph 2 of the Turkish draft might be accepted with the addition of words to the eifect that import and export rates should be applicable to goods imported or exported partly by river and partly by rail, I have the honour to be.

[April 1.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [14905] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received April 1.) India Office, March 31, 1913. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 27th March, forwarding a draft agreement with the Turkish Government regarding the status of Koweit. The Marquess of Crewe understands that His Majesty's Government will still endeavour to obtain Turkish recognition of the limits of Koweit defined in the British memorandum dated the 17th July, 1912, and that only if this proves impracticable will the concession embodied in the present draft be made. I am to offer the following remarks on the text of the draft:— Preamble. —His Lordship would prefer that the words 'and the adjacent territory ' should be omitted, as emphasising unnecessarily and in a way that may arouse the suspicions of the sheikh the distinction between the two areas, which is sufficiently clearly drawn in the body of the agreement. Clause 3.—His Lordship attaches great importance to the reference to foreign relations, and trusts that, though it may be difficult for the Turkish Government to accept it, it will be insisted on. Clause 5.—He would prefer to say ' articles 1 to 4,' thus limiting the Turkish agent to the narrower area and lessening the opportunities for intrigue. His Lordship thinks that it might also be desirable to add to the list of islands what is shown on the map as Maqta Island, although, according to the ' Gazetteer,'.' no channel exists between it and the mainland. Clause 7.—(a.) For ' Hafan ' read ' Hafar.' (6.) Lord Crewe notes that the map attached to Foreign Office Print, 'Asiatic Turkey,' Section 1, February 27, is not quite accurate in that the green line does not clearly include Wabrah and Al Garaa. The sheikh is known to be very anxious to retain Anta'a ('Nta), and his Lordship trusts that this may be secured in return for the concessions made in the earlier part of the agreement, and m view oi the fact that His Majesty's Government are not supporting the wider claims which, as will be seen from the enclosed copy of a telegram from Sir P. Cox, dated the 26th March, 1913, the sheikh has himself made to the | Turkish Government, (c.) As the sheikh expressly claims Um Kasr, it might be advisable to make it clear that His Majesty's Government do not support him by substituting 'forts at Um Kasr and Safwan' for 'fort at Safwan ' in the third line of this clause. The last two lines of the clause are repeated from clause 6, and seem superfluous. Clause 8.—It is understood that a reference to the lease agreement of 1907 will be embodied in this clause, or else that the Turkish Government will be pressed formally to take note, in a separate document of the existence of the lease, which was mentioned in Sir E. Grey's memorandum to the Turkish Ambassador, dated the 24th October, 1911. Clause 10.—Lord Crewe trusts that this will not be included, except in the last resort. The natural line of approach for Turkish troops to Nejd does not lie across the area covered by the agreement, and, in spite of the safeguards that have been inserted, this concession may be a source of much difficulty hereafter. Subject to the above remarks, his Lordship concurs in the terms of the draft. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HOLDERNESS. [2884 a—3]Enclosure in No. 1. Lieutencint-Colonel Sir P.

His Majesty's Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. His Majesty's Government hold, moreover, a lease of land from the Sheikh of Koweit. As regards No. 4, His Majesty's Government take occasion to remind the Sublime Porte that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, and transmitted herewith to the Ottoman Government, but on the custom, consent, and long-established relations between the local chiefs and the Government of India. His Majesty's Government hope that in the communication of these agreements, together with the supplementary declarations which are hereby brought to the notice of the Ottoman Government, the Sublime Porte will see proof of His Majesty's Government's goodwill and desire to facilitate the conclusion of the negotiations set forth in their above-mentioned memorandum.

Admiralty to Foreign Office.—{Received May (3.) ^i r &gt; Admiralty, May 5, 1913. IN reply to your letter of the lllth March, respecting the title of the British naval officer whom it is desired to appoint on the staff of the projected Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy, T am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request that you will represent to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that there appears to be some misapprehension as to the meaning of the names ' Inspector of navigation ' and ' Captain of the port, ' which have been suggested by the Admiralty in previous correspondence. 2. Relerence to the staff of the European commission of the Danube (which is perhaps the nearest existing parallel to the proposed conservancy) will show that among the six principal officers there are two with the designation ' inspecteur de la navi gation ' and 44 capitaine de port ' both retired naval officers. The former is believed to supervise the lighting and buoyage, and advise on hydrographical matters generally, but has no executive duties with regard to the shipping using the river ; the latter is the equivalent of a 44 harbourmaster ' (or at a naval port the 4i King's harbourmaster '), and is understood to be in charge of the pilotage service and the berthing of a ^essels using the port. The latter only would come into direct relation with foreign shipping. 3. In the case of the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy, where, owing to the smaller amount of traffic, one naval officer only would be required, the name 44 inspecteur de la navigation ' appears to my Lords suitable, and has the advantage of indicating that the supervision of lighting, buoyage, &amp;c., is his primary function. Arrangements would have to be made so that his authority would be in no way obtruded on the masters of foreign ships, and the proposed name at any rate is not such as to suggest authority of that kind. 4. The title suggested by Sir E. Grey (Inspector of River Conservancy) is a new one, and appears to my Lords somewhat cumbrous. It could apparently be reduced without loss of meaning to ' conservator,' but that title would only be appropriate to the two members of the 44 conservancy ' themselves. 5. Whatever the decision may be as regards the title, my Lords would deprecate any attempt to minimise the status of the post. While its holder would be unquestionably subordinate to the two commissioners, it appears to be essential that he should be an officer of sufficiently high rank and qualifications if the post is to be of any real use, I am, &amp;c.

T ^ Foreign Office, May 21, 1913. 1 EXr LAIN ED to the French and Russian Ambassadors to-day the position about the Bagdad Railway. W e had made up our minds that nothing could prevent the lailway from going to Basra, and we had decided that the point for us to safeguard &lt;is that the status quo in the Persian CVidf should not be disturbed. An agreement, ad referendum, had therefore been drawn up with a representative of the Turkish Government, under which there were provisions about Koweit, Bahrein, El Katr, and so forth, for socuiiiig the status quo in the-Persian. (rulf, provisions about the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab, and a stipulation that the Bagdad Railway should not go beyond Basra without our consent. We had not claimed participation in the Bagdad Railway, but were to have two directors on the board of the railway from Konieh to Basra.' These diiectors would, ol course, not be able to exercise control, but they would be able to see that, in practice as well as in theory, there was no differentiation of rates on British goods. They would be able to let us know if any such differentiation did take place, in which case we should make diplomatic representations. Since we had made this arrangement with Ifakki Pasha, the German Government had begun to speak to us on the subject. Apparently, they were entitled to claim from Turkey that the Bagdad Railway should, in one way or another, be continued to the Persian Gulf, and they said that, therefore, Turkey could not forgo without their consent the right to make the railway from Basra to the Gulf. But this consent they were willing to give if there was no opposition to the railway being made to Basra, and if they could be assured that the financial guarantees for making the line up to Bagdad, which would be lost by the cession of Turkish territory in Europe to the allies, would be replaced, and if further guarantees were secured to carry the line on to'Basra. This was a matter that would come before the Financial Commission in Pans, and 1 could not commit myself to the German Government without first discussing the matter with the French and Russian Governments. We were now satisfied that, if the railway did not go beyond Basra, we need not regard it as being prejudicial to British interests, and we need not oppose it. The French Ambassador was under the impression that we had secured the right to build the section from Basra to the Gulf, and had been offered the Bagdad-Kanikin branch. I assured him that this was not so. We had not acquired any right to build any section, and we had no participation. It was true that something had been said by an unauthorised German to Mr. Lynch, who was also an unauthorised person, as far as these negotiations were concerned, about giving us the branch from Bagdad to Kanikin. But 1 had discouraged any idea of such a proposal being brought into the discussion, as it seemed to me to affect the arrangement that Russia had made at Potsdam an arrangement that was connected with the Kanikin branch. I am, &amp;c, E. GREY. Also to Mr. O'Beirne (No. 205). [2917 x—5][This Docmnent is the Property of His Britannic Maiiesty's GoYernment.] [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA . [May 21.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [33501] No. 1. Minute hy Mr, Parker. Sir A. Nicolaon, HERR KUHLMANN came to see me yesterday and, after saying he had ascertained that there was no intention, as we had heard, to deflect the main line of the •]Bagdad Railway at Mosul, he proceeded to mention what he described as ' one or two points of detail ' regarding our original conversation of the 7th May. As Sir E. Grey had warned me before that I was not to discuss any fresh proposals, 1 told Ilerr Iviihlmann that I would merely listen to what he had to say and report it. Since some of his ' points of detail' are to the advantage of Germany, I think it is very^ desirable that Sir E. Grey should have this minute, and my original record of Herr Kiihlmann's proposals, before him when he sees Herr Kiihlmann to-morrow. It will be recollected that Herr Kiihlmann has accepted that record as an accurate version of his proposals, and a copy of it is annexed. The important point to bear in mind is that paragraph 6 does not enter as a condition of the proposed written agreement with Germany : I was particularly careful to keep it out by the wording of my minute. The suggested conditions of the bargain with Germany are to be found only in paragraphs 1 to 4 of my record. hen he came on the 20th May, Herr Kiihlmann said he understood the German Company would prefer to build the port of Basra alone. (This is intelligible from the German standpoint, but we should prefer to participate owing to our special interest in the river and for other reasons.) Ihe Germans, he said, would like the conditions for controlling the port at Basra to be the same as those which exist at Haidar Pasha (opposite Constantinople). He would explain those conditions later. If we did exercise any share of control, he said he would prefer that it should be done through the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Commission. {Prima facie, there seems no objection to this, but it must be fully looked into.) The German Government could not absolutely prohibit any German subject from buying shares in the new navigation company, or even from engaging in navigation, but they would undertake not to ' encourage or support' any German subject in taking part in the navigation. The German Government hoped, however, for the sake of public opinion, that the word ' monopoly ' might be avoided in the agreement with Turkey. I said I would report his remarks, but that the monopoly was the essence of the whole thing, just as in effect the Germans had a monopoly on the railway, and I said it seemed to me impossible to secure our object if the word were omitted. He said the German Government hoped we would agree to give an undertaking that there should be no discrimination between the different nations in regard to river traffic rates. (This is quite reasonable.) Then he said that if the company agreed to the ' indefinite postponement ' of the line from Basra to the Gulf it would require financial compensation from the Turkish Government for that section (100 miles or so). (The Germans seem to intend to squeeze the poor Turks, but this is not our business.) Lastly, he said that the company wished not merely to secure the allocation of specific revenues for the main line up to Basra, but also for the branches (which include the Khanikin branch). He said this was a detail which need not be specially brought to Sir E. Grey's attention, but it is, owing to the introduction of the Khanikin branch, a very important detail, and however important the construction of the Khanikin branch may be as an artery of British trade, there seems little doubt that Russia will oppose any attempt on Germany's part to secure the immediate allocation of revenues for tins branch, as the date of completion of that branch has an important effect on Russia's obligations under the Potsdam agreement. The Bagdad Railway Company is of course already entitled, under the original concessi'on of 1903, to secure the allocation of revenues for that branch eventually, but I think we should stipulate with Herr Kuhlmann that, having regard to the exhausted financial condition of [2917 x—2]n 1 \ Turkey at the moment, the company should be content if they secure the allocation of revenues for the main line up to Basra, leaving the branches till a later date. Otherwise there will be a sharp divergence of opinion in the Financial Commission at Paris. Meanwhile it seems important to maintain the position that the question of securing the allocation of revenues for the railway does not enter as a condition exyressis verbis into our bargain with Germany. All that Herr Kiihlmann asked on the 7th May was a sort of collateral assurance that we would help them to get security for the main line to Basra. ^ It seems very desirable to tie the Germans down as soon as possible to their undertaking about the river navigation, lest they should whittle it away, and I venture to suggest that a draft agreement should be prepared ad referendum.

E., C.S.I., Poli'ical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Simla. Foreign Departments I have the honour to reply to Foreign Department Telegram No. 140-8., dated 29th May, asking my views as to the steps which can best be taken in order to enable us to obtain full advantage from the new position which we are acquiring in relation to the Katar Peninsula under the Anglo-Turkish Convention now on the point of conclusion. 2. At the moment, the subject is rendered a little complicated by an independent development, namely, the expulsion of the Turks from Hasa and Katif and the assumption of the control of that province by Bin Saud. Mean while the Porte shows no sign of removing their garrison from A1 Bidaa, and indeed I doubt whether Shaikh Jasim would readily part with it at present, for in the absence of the Turkish garrison or of assurances from us to supply the place of it, he would not unnaturally feel somewhat apprehensive of beiro: absorbed by Bin Saud. 1 For this reason I am inclined to think that another meeting with him at an early date is advisable either on the part of the Political Agent, Bahrain, or myself, for the purpose of explaining to him the gist of the Anglo-Turkish Con vention so far as it concerns Katar and Bahrain, and in order to see vhat we are likely to get him to accept in the direction of closer relations with us. The inability to give him any reply on the subject of the Arms Traffic Subsidy will be a little inconvenient, but I think it will be possible to make him understand that this matter is connected with our current negotiations with the French Government and that the consideration of it necessarily takes a long time. It seems possible that the said negotiations with France may have advanced somewhat in the last few weeks and that the horizon may be clearer for a con sideration of the^ Katar question ; in any case, presuming that the Convention with Turkey admits of it, it will probably be necessary to give Shaikh Jasim a subsidy in some form. 3. As soon as the ground is sufficiently prepared, I am of opinion that we should make a treaty with Shaikh Jasim by which we should recognise his autonomy, give him assurances of protection, (so long as he observes his obliga tions to us) from attack by sea, and good offices to prevent unprovoked attack by land (by Bin Saud for instance) and should In return require from him under takings under the following heads, so far as proves possible. (i) To receive an Agent of the British Government of India at A1 Bidaa ; (for the present a Mohammedan Agent of the type of the Resi dency Agent at Lingah, working immediately under the Political Agent at Bahrain). (ii) To allow British Indians to reside in the Katar ports for trade, and to afford protection for their lives and properties. (Hi) Not to levy duty at more than 5 per cent ad valorem, (iv) To render co-operation generally for the preservation of the Maritime Truce, and in particular for the suppression of the Slave Trade, Piracy and the Arms Traffic. (v) To issue a prohibition against the Import or sale of Arms and Ammunition in Katar territory except under special license. (vi) To undertake not to allow foreigners including British subjects, to acquire monopolies or concessions ; or to acquire pearling rights or use diving dresses in his waters, without the cognizance and approval of the British Government. '3 &lt;3r(vii) Not to admit the Agent of any Power other than Great Britain (and Turkey ?) and not to correspond with the officials of any other Power without the cognizance and concurrence of the British Authorities. (viii) To receive and protect a British Post Office and Telegraph installa tion (as at Kuwait and Bahrain) whenever the British Govern ment consider that the step is needed. 4. It goes without saying that we should go slow in working for these desiderata and that we could not expect to obtain them all at once, even in prin ciple. It does not seem to me that any of the items are incompatible with the terms of the Convention with Turkey, hut this is a point for the consideration of higher authority. The first three necessary steps seem to be to explain the situation to Shaikh Jasim and his son in charge of Doha; to get rid of the Turkish garrison and then get our Residency Agent installed I presume that His Majesty's Government will take steps to expedite the withdrawal of the garrison, as soon as the Convention is finally accepted ; meanwhile the Government of India wilt perhaps feel able to authorise me to put the other two steps in hand, informing me at the same time whether any communication can be made to him with reference to my letter No. 755, dated 2nd March 1913, on the subject of art Arms Traffic Subsidy. 5.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. In consequence of the precarious state of the Shaikh of Kuwait's health as previously reported, no intimation has, up to the 20th May, been made to him as regards the terms of the draft Convention respecting Kuwait. I, however, instructed Political Agent to communicate verbally to the Shaikh as from myself a general idea of what we believed to be the probable terms of the document in view of the foregone cast of Convention contained in Beuter's telegrams of the 17th instant, which ordinarily go to Kuwait; and impressed on His Highness when so doing that his general position had been satisfactorily assured and that it had no doubt been necessary to adopt a give and take attitude in regard to some points detailed as is necessary in the case of all amicable agreements in order to achieve a satisfactory position for His Highness. The Political Agent now wires that the Shaikh has received fairly well his communication as a whole, but that His Highness ' expressed in strongest and most vehement manner his absolute refusal ever to permit residence of any Turkish Agent in Kuwait. ' Later on, after sleeping over the matter, Shaikh came over to see the Political Agent in an agitated state of mind and reiterated his refusal asking that it should be communicated to Government of India. His Highness pointed out that his engagements with us had been undertaken expressly as a defence against this contingency and that he had faithfully observed these engagements. Political Agent goes on to state that there is evidence that Shaikh believes that his interest may have been sacrificed as regards this item for some quid pro quo and expresses the belief that short of strongest coercion nothing will alter attitude of Shaikh. The explanation given in Foreign Department tele gram, dated 13th July 1912, does not carry weight with him. I earnestly hope the Government of India will be able to get this item eliminated, firstly, it is really a modification of status quo ; secondly, as I have already urged {vide my telegram No. 690, dated 6th July 1912), His Highness in his capacity of Kaimmakam is himself a representative of Turkish interests: or perhaps Shaikh could get round the difficulty by appointing one of his sons for the special purpose of dealing with Turkish cases and interests. The present disturbing situation at Basrah and Katif seems to offer us an excellent opportunity to warn Turkish Government of His Highness's refusal and of the danger at present juncture of rendering him hostile and the importance of getting Convention pushed through without delay. I earnestly hope that some means for getting rid of or round legislature (article ? difficulty ?) will be sought by the Government of India, MEMORANDUM.

From—The Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, Baghdad, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla, May I be permitted to ask whether the question of Baghdad-Basrah Railway has yet been decided ? I would respectfully point out, if this question has not been settled, that with a view to the future it might not be prudent to exchange the prospective railway interests for the immediate advantages of navigation. The railway will, it is possible, and to me it seems probable, put an end to navigation. The Indus case is not quite similar, but in that case there are no (appreciable ?) steamers (it has no) (and ?) it is said that down stream traffic by native boats is dying out and there a railway now exists on each bank. Prime interests here, in my humble opinion, are firstly irrigation and secondly railway: the question of future navigation, especially in the event of the rivers being tapped by canals, is nothing more than problematical.

Moreover seeing that there will be British Agent at Kuwait that the Turks bind themselves not to interfere in internal and external affairs or succession, and that the Shaikh is so long as he keeps his engagements with us, formally assured of our support, admission of Turkish Agent is regarded by His Majesty's Government as purely joroybrma and there!ore it is hoped, in view of the identity of our interests with his, that Shaikh will acquiesce in an arrangement to which we would never have agreed had we apprehended any danger therefrom. The greatest importance is attached by His Majesty's Government to the Shaikh's acceptance of the agreement as it stands and the Political Besident should proceed to Kuwait himself, if necessary.

H*. C.*. t Gives in detail thejnanner in which the Sheikh received cornaH^ioation of general outline of the terms of the Convention. The following points elicited remarks from the Sheikh-: (1). The recognition of Turkish euzeraii -ty.(P.A. gave tne analogy of Egypt^, (2). Residence of a Turkish Agent. The The Sheikh said that the presence c of such an official,judging from his bitter experience of Turkish officials,would destroy whatever good the Convention might holdj would weaken his authority locally and in the adjacent desert5would lead to constant strife and the formation of parties among his people;whilst the Turkish Agency would become a focus for intrigue and would probably involve the British Govt, itself at no distant, date,in difficulties which at present were not foreseen by them. Sheikh subsequently visited P.A.and pointed out that Colonel -oade's agreement of Januarv 1899 was framed with the sole object of preventing the advent of^foreign officials in Koweit,and that it now appeared to. him that this was just what we were trying to bring about.He also pointed out that in the Bandar Shweikh Agreement of October 1907 we had especiallvv^/ named the Turkish Govt, as one it • a? particularly desirable to ^ ^ 1- _____Art &amp; ^ ^ 2. Substance of communication made to the , Sheikh by P.A.Koweit on or about May 23* 3 P.A. was carefut to dwell upon the effort which H.M's Govt, had made to secure A 1• The autonomy of Koweit. i 2. An acknowledgement of our special relations with its Ruler, £ The ^cognition,as far as possible, of the boundaries claimed by the Sheikh. 4. A definite pronuncement regarding the Sheikh's authority over adjacent islands and the nearer Bedouin tribes 5. The prohibition by the Porte in Kowe- -it's domestic or foreign questions. 6. fhe exclusion of Turkish troops from the Sheikh's territory. The admission of the Sheikh's right to the undisturbed enjoyment of his Properties on the Shatt-al-Arab. P.A.then pointed out that there must , alwa^ be a certain amount of give and take in^cill agreements, and consequently in order to obtain the above solid advan tages it had been necessary to give way on some points of detail to avoid wounding Turkish susceptibilities,and it was therefore probable that 1. The Turkish posts at Umr Kasr and Safwan would continue. 2, That the recognition of Turkish suzerainty would be likely to entail a demand from the Porte for the res- -idence of a Turkish Agent at Koweit. Sheikh will probably ask for reasons for the inclusion of the following clauses in the Convention-: Clause relating to 1.The acknowledgement of Turkish suzer- -ainty- hitherto disputed. 2.The residence of a Turkish official in Koweit- hitherto strenuously opposed. 3. The maintaining of Turkish military posts-hitherto protested against as encroachments. 4. The ejxz circumscribing of boundaries -hitherto unquestioned and actualTy ' 5.

(c*hS*J also mentioned having refus- -ed German overtures in deference to oi?^ wishes,though he was thereby forfeiting a certain increse in his Customs revenue. He concluded by staying that he rwce had faithfully carrieonis partyof a bargain now 14 years old. ^ He asked whether Convention referre only to Koweit or whether other Gulf qE ' questions and the Baghdad Rly» were also deilt with therein,and gave the impressT that he had a suspicion at the back of tf his mind that his interests had been neglected by us in order that we might secure from the Turks some substantial advantage in some other direction. He failed to see why ,in the present shattered condition of the Turkish empire,we should have found it necessary to make any concession to the Turks,and' that for his own part he wished 'to remain as he was, namely with an auth- -ority in the desert which could not be disputed by the Turksjto whom he was not subject and never hacf been. The Turks might dub him 'Kaimakam* 1 or anything elFfc they liked but he did not see how this could affect the situation as he never made use of their titles. (3). He rather resented the continu- -ance of the Turkish posts at Umr Kasr and Safwan,but when P.A,explained that # we were endeavouring to secure the recognition of his boundary in that direction Sheikh seemed inclined to waive his objection to this point. (1) It is to be clearly impressed on the Sheikh that he is not being sacrificed in return for any quid pro quo,and that what is being demanded of him is part of the price he must pay in return for the permanent establishment,on a treaty basis, of his positionjand the recognitixT^ of his ample claims.

The Imperial Ottoman Government having examined the question of the frontier which separates Ottoman and Per sian territory between Hawizeh and the sea declares that the frontier must be fixed as follows The frontier starts at the spot named Umm Shir, where the Khor-al-Douvil flows into the Khor-al-Azem. Umm Shir is situated to the East of the spot where the Khor-al- Muhaisin Joins the Khor-al-Azem 9 miles to the North-West of Bisaitin, which is situated in latitude 31* 43* 29 M . Leaving Umm Shir the line runs South-West and reaches longtitude 45 at the Southern extremity of a small lake also known as Azem, situated in the Khor-al-Azem at a point some distance North-West of Shuaib. From this point the line continues in a southemly direction along the Marsh as far as latitude 31 which it follows due East up to a point to the North-East of Kishk-i-Basri, in such a man ner as to leave that place in Ottoman territory. From here the line goes in a southerly direction until it cuts the Nahr-al-Khaiyin at a point situated between the Nahr Daiji and the Nahr Abuul Arabid, From this point the line fol lows the course of the Nahr-al-Khaiyin up to its junction with the Nahr Nazaileh and the Shatt-al-Arab, from whence it follows the stream of the Shatt-al-Arab to the sea leaving the waters of that river and all the islands lo cated therein in Ottoman territory^subject to the follow ing conditions and exceptions (a). Appertaining to Persia -; 1. The Island of Muhalla, and the two Islands whidi lie between it and the left bank of the Shatt- al-Arab, i.e. the Persian bank of Abadan Island.

All islets actually existing and those which do not exist at present but which may be formed here after and which may be connected to Abadan Island, at low water, or to Persian mainland below the ITahr-i-Nazaileh, (b). The modem Port of Mohammerah and its anchorage both above and below the junction of the Karun River with the ohatt-al-Arab, will continue to be under Persian jurisdiction in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Erzeroum. This shall not annul the of tne Forte to make use of the River, and the Persian Government shall not be entitled to exercise jurisdiction over that part of the River outside the anchorage, (c). No interference will take place with existing rights, usages, or eustoms in regard to fishing on the Persian bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, the word Vi- vage w also includes lands connected to the shore at low water, (d). The Ottoman Government cannot extend its juris diction so as to include those parts 6f the Persian shore which are liable to be temporarily covered by flood or by other accidental causes. The Persian Government, in the same way, cannot exercise juris diction over such lands as may become temporarily or accidentally exposed when the normal level of the sea at low tides is exceeded.

The Imperial Ottoman Government having examined the question of the frontier which separates Ottoman and Per sian territory between Hawizeh and the sea declares that the frontier must be fixed as follows The frontier starts at the spot named Umm Shir, where the IQior-al-Douvil flows into the Khor-al-Azem. Umm Shir Is situated to the East of the spot where the T \hor-al- ftihaisin joins the Khor-al-Azem 9 miles to the North-West 5f Bisaitin, which is situated in latitude 31• 45 1 29 w • leaving Umm Shir the lino runs Gouth-West and reaches Longtitude 45 at the Southern extremity of a small lake ilso known as Azem, situated in the Khor-al-Azem at a point some distance North-West of Shuaib.

WITH reference to the conference which took place to-day at the Board of Trade, I am directed by Secretary Sir E.

Hakki Pasha stated that he did not think the Turkish Government would object to the work in question being undertaken by the proposed Turkish company at its own risk and expense. Hakki Pasha was further informed that Lord Inchcape would be the coucession- naire suggested by His Majesty's Government for the new company, and his Highness was asked if he would be prepared to undertake negotiations with his Lordship as to the proposed concession. Hakki Pasha replied that he would ask his Government for instructions on this point. I am, &amp;c. W. LANGLEY.

India Office to Foreign Office.— {Received June 10.) India Office, June 9, 1913. IN reply to your letter of the Gtli iustant respecting the Bagdad Railway negotiations, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he concurs generally in the terms of the draft memorandum which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposes to present to the German Ambassador. The Marquess of Crewe also agrees with Sir E. Grey that the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Commission should have power to correspond directly with the foreign consuls at Basra, and that the latter should have the right of making recommendations in a purely advisory capacity. He would be unwilling to go further than this in the direction of admitting Germany to participation in the conservancy of the river, which, being of a purely technical nature, has no analogy with a commercial undertaking like the Bagdad Railway Company. As regards British participation in the financing and construction of the port of Basra, there appears to be a certain ambiguity, since the German notice refers to the former process, in your letter to the latter, while article 2 {d) of the draft declaration (which also mentions a different percentage) does not clearly specify which is intended. Lord Crewe sees no objection to the British share of the capital being raised by the National Bank, provided that Sir E. Grey and the Board of Trade are satisfied as to the genuinely British nature of that concern. But he sees no room for the intervention of a bank in respect of the allocation of a percentage in the construction to British firms. He presumes that this would be effected by the company itself calling for British tenders for certain works, and that it would be for the British directors to see that this obligation was duly discharged. In conclusion, I am to say that the Marquess of Crewe welcomes the evidence which the German attitude affords of a desire to meet the wishes of His Majesty's Government, and ventures to express the hope that full advantage may be taken of it to improve the relations between the two countries. From this point of view, as well as from that of securing material British interests in Western Persia as w T ell as in Mesopotamia, he would not be sorry if it should prove possible, consistently with our obligations to France and Russia, to find a somewhat more positive formula for article 5 (i.e., article G in amended copy) of the draft declaration than that furnished by the Potsdam agreement.

Note hy Captain Wilson regarding the proposed provision for the Extradition from Koweit of persons wanted hij the Turks. [N.B.—The word ' extradition ' is used for convenience only : it is scarcely applicable in its strict sense.] THE following notes represent, I believe, generally speaking, the view of the question that would be taken by Sir P. Cox : I have written without reference to records, however, and subject to correction on all points :— 1. Extradition has been refused by the sheikh in the past to the Turkish authorities, and cases are on record at Bushire where the demand has been made by the authorities of Basra, not complied with by the sheikh and not pressed by the Turks. The existing status quo certainly does not provide for it, and on this ground I think we should resist any formal demand for it. 2. The Sheikh of Koweit could not possibly enforce extradition on his dependants on the drastic scale provided for in Hakki Pasha's draft, and his personal prerogatives in such a matter are strictly limited by immemorial Arab custom and local observance. 3. The indiscriminate extradition of accused persons is contrary to well-known and almost universally recognised Arab (and Mohammedan) custom ; whether provided for in our agreement or not, it cannot in practice be observed locally and can only lead to friction and give local Turkish authorities occasion to pick quarrels with the sheikh. A useful case to quote in support of the above contention might be the murder by Arabs in 1904- of a Bahrein notable whilst hunting on Turkish territory in Hasa. Mv recollection is that when we demanded the surrender of the guilty parties the Turks pleaded that the malefactors had taken refuge with an Arab tribe who refused to give them up, and that the Turkish authorities were not in a position to insist on their surrender. 4. Hakki Pasha's draft provides for extradition of any persons wanted by the Turkish provincial authorities whether Turkish subjects or not, and whether accused of serious crime or of petty civil misdemeanour ; nor does it provide for any reciprocal obligation on the part of the Turks. In all these respects it will certainly be unacceptable and unworkable. Turkey has refused ' extradition ' (the capitulations notwithstanding) to Great Britain ; she has also generally in practice refused it to Persia, in spite of the specific provisions of the treaties of 1746 and 1823. The fact is, the principle of extradition is repugnant to eastern ideas. 5. My impression is that Hakki Pasha's draft goes far beyond the provisions of Ottoman law on the subject. No Arab chief in Turkish Arabia or Mesopotamia is expected to hand over without question any person against whom proceedings are pending in the Ottoman tribunals (by which the judicial tribunals are presumably intended). In this connection I am under the impression that the papers regarding the Glanville murder at Basra in 1904 or 1905 will show that the local authorities at Basra admitted their inability to obtain the surrender of accused persons who had taken refuge with certain Arab tribes such as the Muntafik and Al-bu-Mahammad. 6. In support of the contention (paragraph 3 supra) regarding Arab and Mohammedan custom, it may be mentioned that no arrangements for extradition inter se exist between any Mohammedan principalities as far as my own knowledge goes, e.g., Muscat and Zanzibar, Muscat and Bahrein, Bahrein and Koweit, and Persia and Turkey (in practice). Each case is dealt with on its merits as it arises, the laws of hospitality and sanctuary being jealously guarded. See Moirs Commentary on the Koran and Doughty. The Koranic law has, I believe, explicit provisions on the subject. [2950 k—7]r ^ is We ourselves, if I remember right, do not extradite Muscat subjects from India on principle, but I am not clear about this. 7, There are some thousands of Persians, Bahreinis, and Trucial Coast Arabs in Koweit, and every year Arabs from Najd and elsewhere visit Koweit. The extradition of persons coming under these categories, and of persons who are only colourably Turkish subjects would raise very awkward questions. Having regard to the above, I venture with great deference to suggest— (1.) That any provision for extradition is unnecessary, Koweit being a Qaza and the sheikh a Qaimmagam (or Wali ?). (2.) Alternatively, that any provision inserted should be— (a.) Reciprocal and mutual. (5.) That extradition from Koweit should apply only to hond fide Turkish subjects and vice versa. (c.) Who are accused of grave criminal offences, justiciable by the highest Ottoman judicial tribunals. (d.) That the demand for extradition should come in every case direct from the Porte and not from irresponsible local officials. (e.) That the obligation be qualified by the words, ' so far'as in him lies the sheikh ' (3.) Alternatively, ' that a clause be drafted providing that deserters and malcon tents from Turkey shall not be received, and shall be expelled if found in Koweit territory.' A. T. W.

Trevor, G.I .E., Political Agent, Bahrein, To Lieut-Colonel Sir Percy Gox, K.O.I .S., C.S.I,, Political Resident in the Peraian Gulf. Dated Bahrein, the 5th July 19115 Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the 2nd in stant Sheikh Isa sent his Secretary Sagar Zayyani to me with a letter which had been received from the Vali of Busreh. The letter was dated 27th Jamadi II, 1351 (=20th May 1913) but it appeared from the postmarks that it had been missent to Bombay. In it the Wali asked Sheikh Isa to arrest and return to Busreh an absconding government servant named Saleh Effendi, w^o was said to be in Bahrein- Sheikh Isa had enquiries made and it was ascertained that the individual in question had been in Bahrein sometime but had made himself scarce about a fortnight ago. The Sheikh seemed anxious to reply to the letter, and there seemed no reason that an answer to the above effect should not be sent. Sheikh Isa accordingly wrote a letter informing the Wali that the absconder had been in Bahrein but had left a short time ago. This letter was 'shown to me today by Sagar and will no doubt' go by this mail. As soon as the new Anglo-Turkish Agreement is signed T trust that the Turkish Government will take steps to prevent the local Turkish Authorities from communicating with Sheikh Isa direct. Most of the letters are about absconders, and as under the forthcoming Bahrein Order-in-Council the Resident will, I understand, take the place of the Governor of a Colony forfor purposes of the Fugitive Offenders and Extradition Acts as far as Bahrein is concerned, presumably the local Turkish * officials should address themselves to you in such matters, unless it is more correct for them to arrange matters through H.M. Consul at Busreh. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. l T a jor. Political Agent, Bahrein.Confidential. No. 405 of. 1913. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHREIN• From To Major A.P. Trevor, C.I .E., Political Agent, Bahrein, Lieut-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Dated Bahrein» the 3rd July 1915 Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your endorsement No. 1964 dated 22nd June forwarding me a copy of your letter No. 1963 to the Government of India on the subject of the steps to be taken in Katar after the signing of the Anglo- Turkish Convention. 2. I beg to say that I have no special observations to make in respect of the proposals which you have made, which seem to meet the case completely, unless in regard to Sub-Section (viii) para 3, it is considered worth while to add that no Post or Telegraph office other than British is to be admitted. 3. During the last few days a respectable Hasawi who had been to Katar informed Yusuf Kanoo that Sheikh Jasim bin Thani and many of the people were not pleased when they heard that Katar was to be under British Protection) apparently they are under the impression that the An^lo-Turkish Convention has transferred Katar from Turkish to British protection. When the new Turkish detachment arrived a short time ago. Sheikh Jasim was pleased, presumably hoping that it meant a postponement of the evil day. 4. There is no doubt that Sheikh Jasim clings firmly to the Turkish detachment since Bin Saud became active, and he will not part with it if he can help it, unless he gets some assur ance from us. All reports seem to show that he dislikes and fears Bin Saud.r\ : may add that our informant, who probably went to Katar to buy arms, also reports that the people have bought up a number of arms and are keeping them, as it seems that the sup ply of arms for sale has run short. ^In conclusion T would observe that I am ready at any time to go over and see Sheikh Jasim about the matter, but as I have not yet had an opportunity of making his acquaintance, I expect that a visit from you, if you have time, would be much more effective if anything is to be arranged.

In continuation of my telegram No, 1223 of 9th instant, I have the honour to report in fuller detail what passed at my interviews withithe Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in connection with the Anglo-Turkish Convention. 2. I arrived at Mohommerah in His Majesty's Ship ' Sphinx' on the evening of 4th instant and was fortunate in finding Shaikh Mobarak still staying with the Shaikh of Mohammerah. Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Kuwait, had also arranged to rendezvous with me there. 3. On the morning of 5th Major Haworth and I had a long interview with the Shaikh of Mohammerah alone. We read him a translation of the Agreement regarding the Frontier, as initialled, but described the course of it from its, point of contact with the Khalyin, to the sea, as indicated by the line shown in the map, in emendation of the description given in the Convention. Having to some extent forgotten the details of what passed at our interview with hiirT of 20th Vide Residency letUr No. 1936,' dated 25th August IQI2, Shaikh Khazal Was inclined Au:ust 1912, to the Government of India in the to start old hares on the boundarv line Foreign Depaitment. , • 1 1 11 \ * such as the mid-channel theory; but on the whole, except for the necessity of travelling over old ground again, we had little trouble in this co nnection. The Sha ikh did not again raise the question of the definitioix^-^-^^^ ' -i« reference to the relation of islands to the ; while on tne subject of Hakki Pashas' reservation in »gard to the Khaiyin lands, he was surprisingly sensible, confident no doubt in the thought that in view of established local facts, it has no concrete signi- ficance. 4- ^ e then went on to deal with the question of the Riverain Commission, in which connection translations of such of the provisions of the Convention as affect Mohammerah were read and explained to the Shaikh. He was very uneasy as to the probably troublesome results ^iiich might be expected to ensue from the control of the whole of the waters ofllT^11vrTp«HMU^ssels afloat thereon, by a Turkish Commission, and from the inevitable activities of its subordinate employes. In discussing this problem he again raised the question of the mid-channel line, arguing that from the point where the Karun, a Persian river, joins the ShaU-al-Arab, it surely was only fair that Persia should share the possession of the riyer. But as Haji Rais was not present on this occasion and we had already been talking for over three hours and the Shaikh was getting tired, we were unable to dispose of the question of the Commission at this sitting and therefore adjourned, leaving the translation with the Shaikh for further study and discussion with Haji Rais, and with the intention of finishing with it at the Shaikh's return visit to me. Meanwhile, and indeed all along, the latter expressed his firm intention, after talking things out, to comply with our final advice in the matter. 5. Before parting company I asked him to arrange with his guest. Shaikh Mobarak, for me f to visit him the following forenoon, and told Shaikh Khazal briefly what I had to say to the former. He himself took a sensible view of the question of the location of a Turkish Agent, recognising its one convenient aspect, i.e., as an indication of Shaikh Mobarak's autonomous position ; and he promiied to endeavour to influence his friend in the right direction. 6. At Shaikh Khazal s visit to the Consulate on 7th, he was accompanied by Haji Rais, and they brought an old volume of treaties in Persian, containing the text of the Treaty of Erzeroum, relying on which they started the mid- channel question again. AH the old ground had to be gone over once more, but the Shaikh and his factotum were ultimately persuaded that the recognition of the iurkish claim to the whole river as provided by the Treaty of Erzeroumj C42FD (M Isn(] 'L l) ■ - u with the alternative of an appeal to the Hague, had been a necessary step \n order to secure, in the Shaikh's own interests, the frontier that he wanted from the Duwairij southwards to the Khaiyin : and that no useful object would result from any attempt to reopen that question now. 7. This point having been finally disposed of, the question of the powers of the Riverain Commission and the delegation of Mobammerah interests to the care of the British Commissioner was then gone into. We found that the right of the Commission to deal with vessels in touch with the Persian Bank greatly exercised both the Shaikh and Haji Rais, especially in view of the wording of the sentence in the declaration stipulating that the functions performed by the Commissioner supervising the interests of the Shaikh of Mohammerah must be discharged without prejudice to his quality as a Member of the Turkish Com mission. The Shaikh feared the contingency of the British Commissioner perhaps a stranger to himself, being over-influenced by his Turkish r61e and perhaos led to act against Mohammerah interests arbitrarily without consulting its Ruler. We endeavoured to persuade him that his apprehensions on this point were premature and that the British Commissioner would surely receive all such preliminary instructions from the British Government as might be necessary to ensure Mohammerah interests being really protected. Eventually we arranged in concert the draft of a letter of acceptance for the Shaikh to send me, and this he did in due course. I attach a transla- Enc,osure ^ tion thereof and trust that the Shaikh's accompanying stipulation will not be considered inconvenient or unreasonable. After settling the terms of this draft we adjourned to other matters of business. I need not dilate upon the extrem^nttportance of Iwttmp the Shaikh feel that the British Commissioner will really be m sympathy with him aaJ see that his interests are fully protected. To this end I would urge Government to be* pleased to consider the expediency of putting forward for selection as Bntis Commissioner the names of officers conversant with the politics and if possible the languages of the Shatt-al-Arab region, as being likely to have a better chance of establishing confidence and sympathetic relations with the bhaikh. 8. I now beg to turn to my dealings with the Shaikh of Kuwait. am Shakespear and I interviewed him at Failiyeh on 6th July, Shaikh TLiidtdu beincr also present. 1 took up the;thread with Shaikh Mobarak from the point where the Political Agent had left it, as reported in my telegram No. 948, dated 27th May. A translation of the Articles of the Convention dealing with Kuwait, includ ing the extradition clause, as framed in the Secretary of State's telegram of 17th Tune—alternative (ii) was read to him. He demurred somewhat at the excision of Umm Kasr and Safwan but had apparently resigned himself to their loss and as regards the .rest of the boundary he acquiesced in it practically without remark. In the remainder of the Kuwait articles there were three points on which he had something to say — (i) the clause in article (2), providing for the location of a Turkish Agent at Kuwait. (ii) the use of the word ' Khalaf ' ' successor' and not ' aolad ' = sons in article 2. (iii) the clause providing for the establishment of Customs Offices in article 8. It was Item (i) with which the discussion which followed was mainly concerned, but it will be more convenient to dispose of (ii) and (iii) first, 9. As regards the question of terminology in (ii), I was not positive off-hand what the Arabic word used in previous engagements with him was, but without pursuing that point it was explained to him that as the Turks had expressly undertaken not to interfere in the succession, it seemed of little consequenc e * i•s&amp; /7*s Y whether this particular Convention used the word ' successor ' or some other cognate expression, as the question was one which rested between himself and us alone. Without the Arabic text it was difficult to say more on this point than what I have recorded above ; bat it is referred to in the Shaikh's letter to me and my reply.* It will be found that •En losuresa and 4. j n t h e Shwaikh Agreement the word u sons ' (aolad) was not used as the Shaikh thought, but the word ' heirs' (warasah), and that we managed to fence with the vide correspondence endin? with Foreign dynastic issue then raised by the Shaikh. Ma^chT908. lettCr No I054 ' E • B ■ , dated ,6th My written reply to the latter (enclosure 4) leaves the question in the same position as did the Shwaikh Agreement, and I shall be glad to know what further, if anything, His Majesty's Government would wish me to say to him. It might be worth while, if Shaikh Mobarak himself wishes it, that we should offer to recognise his successor—presumably his son and deputy Shaikh Jabr—in his life time. This would probably set his mind at rest completely as regards his own succession and lead him to forget or drop all further efforts to secure a permanent dynastic guarantee. I solicit telegraphic orders on this point. (iii). The Customs clause, at which he at once called a halt, brought us on to somewhat delicate ground, but it seemed to me that the best line to take was that the Article discussed contingencies which might never take shape, so that in any case it seemed premature to come to issue over them now. We went on to explain that if the railway did eventually come to Kuwait, it would obviously be unreasonable for him to expect to receive the duty, or all the duty, on through cargo, and that in any case a preliminary discussion and arrangement would have to be arrived at between the Porte and ourselves, acting in his behalf, for regulat ing the distribution of the duties on through export or import cargo at Kuwait in a manner Lo iurkey. In regard to local cargo his rights w DU j &lt; h--or , 'course have to be specifically separated or safeguarded. I expressed the personal view that this was an instance in \\hich our interests and his would be the same and that it would be our business to see that he was fairly treated. Shaikh Khazal gave useful help in getting Mobarak to view this question in a sensible light. 10. We now come to his main objection, the clause requiring him to receive a Turkish 11 Commissaire ' or Agent in Kuwait. Here, to begin with. Shaikh Mobarak was bluntly uncompromising, saying that it was one of the specific and chief features^t~ing^agreements with us that he should refuse to receive the agent of any Foreign Power, incTuding Turkey, and that the admission of any representative on the part of the Turkish Govern ment in Kuwait was the one thing that he had been always determined to resist a foutrance and had up to now succeeded in withstanding. Then followed a long discussion in which the case of Egypt and the argument that the appointment was a useful indication and necessary result of the recognition of his administrative autonomy were made the most of. Eventually he agreed, provided that I would confirm the purport of their message in writing, to bow to the will and advice of Kis Majesty's Government, relying on their assurance of the identity of our interests and on the enjoyment of their efficacious support in case of need against the activities and intrigues on the part of the Turkish Agent which he instinctively apprehended, and which he feared would prove no less a woiry to ourselves than to him 1 was^not specially authorised to give him the purport of the Secretary of States s telegram in writing ; but I do not think I should have got his assurance in writing without it, and my refusal to give it would have aroused undesirable suspicion of our good faith in his mind. 11. We separated a few minutes later and he subsequently sent me the letter of acceptance of which I attach a Enclosure 3. translation. The first portion is based on lines suggested to him by myself, the remainder, from the words ' I would only represent ' onwards, is not meant by him to detract from his acceptance ; but merely reminds us of the three questions of Succession. Customs, and Admis sion of European foreigners to Kuwait in connection with which he eitherforesees difficulty and claims our support, or feels that the situation needs clearing by the light of the Convention. With the first two matters I have dealt sufficiently in the foregoing paragraphs. As regards the third—his future attitude towards foreigners— Shaikh Mobarak incidentally referred to the question of the overtures made to him in the past by Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., and enquired whether his obligation to admit a Turkish Agent involved any obligation or permission to admit other foreigners. I replied that our advice to him to keep Messrs. Wonckhaus and others at a safe distance had reference partly to the indefinite nature of his status vis a vis the Turks, a fatt which was likely to afford such persons opportunities for intrigue. I continued that my personal view was that the regulation and establishment ot his status by the present Convention somewhat altered the position, but I explained that the terms of the Convention only provided for and referred to the admission of a Turkish Agent, and did not affect his existing understanding with us as regards others ; so that I considered that it was still obligatory for him to consult us before admitting other foreigners. 1 concluded, however, that I would, if he desired, make a fresh reference to Government with regard to the case of Messrs. Wonckhaus and ascertain their views. Shaikh Mobarak agreed that that was the best course to pursue, and I i trust that I shall receive instructions on the point. 12. 1 hough there is no doubt that by the achievement of the Convention with I urkey, Shaikh Mobarak's position, provided that he has our staunch support in repelling the slightest encroachment by the Turks on the terms of it, is greatly improved, yet there can equally be no doubt that in virtue of our engagement 0 with Kuwait, more especially Articles 5, g, 10 and 12 of the Shwaikh Agreement, we bear a very serious and lively responsibility towards the Shaikh ; and I therefore venture very respectfully to draw pointed attention to those Articles now and to express the earrrc^t hope thai wo &lt;;hall demonstrate to the Shaikh and to the Porte, from the moment the Conven ion comes into operation, our fixed intention to protect Shaikh Mobarak's interests to the utmost. 13. Before concluding this somewhat lengthy report, I should like to avail myself of the opportunity, now that those portions of the Convention affecting the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah are practically completed, of recording my acknowledgments for the loyal co-operation which I have received through out from Captain Shakespear and Major Haworth, the Political Officers accreditedj^rlhose potentates, at my recent interviews and in the spade work the spot in connection with the details. I have the more reason to appreciate this in that owing to the absence of direct telegraphic communication with either port, and the fact that many of Government's references needed speedy telegraphic reply, I have been unable always to consult them before replying as freely as I should wish to have done; but Government will, I am sure, appreciate the fact that the amenable demeanour of the Shaikhs is due in no inconsiderable measure to the happy relations existing between them and the two Political Officers attached to them. I also wish at the same time to commend to Government the excellent work done and valuable assistance rendered to me by Captain A. T. Wilson, in connection with the Mohammerah frontier question. 14. I am sending copies of this communication to His Majesty's Minister and to the Political Secretary, India Office, for information. Enclosure 1.

After compliments, At my interview with Your Honour and our friend Sardar Arfa (Shaikh of Mohammerah) to-day, I told Your Honour of my having learnt from Captain Shakespear of your being somewhat disturbed by the condition in the Convention dealing with the location of a Turkish representative at Kuwait. I informed Government of the anxiety which you felt on the subject and tp-day I have informed you verbally of the terms of their response. I also explained to you my personal view that the mere existence of the necessity of appointing a Turkish Ap;e nt would he ra ther a useful indication of the adminis trative autonaBa^-crf-yeuf Government. As you requested I now write to you the communication which I was instructed to make to you, so that you may have it by you. In it Government intimate that in their opinion the points which you have conceded in the course of this agreement—which was on a give and take basis you must regard as the price paid in exchange for the great advantages which you derive from it. Among them the confirmation of your independence on the basis of this Convention, and the formal recognition of your extensive claims. Further, it is not hidden from Your Honour that the Sublime Porte undertakes not to interfere in the question of succession or in The^-mternal or external affairs of your administration, and you are also aware that there will always bean Agent of the British Government accredited to you at Kuwait ; again, it is established in your mind that you have the formal assurance of the British Government to support you in your affairs, so long as you faithfully observe your engagements to us as you have in the past. Having regard to all these considerations and after these explicit explana tions, the British Government is confident that Your Honour will realise that the matter of the appointment of a Turkish Agent at Kuwait is one of the nature of a formality and that there is no cause for you to be alarmed and disturbed thereby. In conclusion 1 am directed to assure you that there is no divergence between your interests and those of the British Government, and that if they had seen in this detail anything harmful or dangerous for Your Honour, they would not have approved of it or recommended it for your acceptance.

(Datedj Mohammerah, yth July /p/j.) I have received your esteemed letter of the 6th July 1913 (1st Shaaban l 33 l &gt;) an ^ understood its contents, in confirmation of what you explained to me verbally at our interview to«day, {i.e., 6th July).I trust you will inform the British Government that I recognise and admit the force of your explanations that my interests and those of the British Govern ment are identical and that there is no difference between them ; and accordingly it is incumbent on me to rely upon the advice of the Great Government in this matter; but they will, I am sure, understand that when any doubt enters my mind and I see in any measure a probable source of difficulty and danger to my own interests or those of Government, it is proper for me to communicate my apprehensions for their august views. But in view of your explanations and letter under reply, I can but bow to their view and authorise Your Honour to say that I shall rely on the Great Government to support me so long as I am firm in faithful fulfilment of my engagements with them as in the past ; please God I shall preserve those obligations and increase my intimate attachment to the Great Government and shall act up to what is written in our Treaties and even more than that. I would only represent to you that among the stipulations in our Treaties and in the agreement regarding the lease of land at Bandar Shwaikh, my '* sons' are specified as my successors, while now in the condition as arranged between the two Governments, the word ' Khalaf ' appears. Now ' Khalaf ' (succes sors) ^includes sons Again in our Treaties I am described as not agreeing to the presence in Kuwait of the subjects of any foreign Government, especially the Turkish Government. These are two points in our treaties and further in the documentary agree ment between yourselves and me in regard to the lease of land at Shweikh, I stipulated that the right of levying Customs duty on your subjects and others belonged to me, and on this understanding the agreement was reached, and I have the deed and you also have a duplicate*— I have explained to you these three points, please give them your high consideration. And whatever was included in the Treaty was with the concur rence of both parties and the agreement regarding the lease of land at Shweikh was also concluded with the concurrence of both parties. I beg to refer this to Your Honour's consideration, and attention, and the decision rests with you. (Sealed) MOBARAK BIN SUBAH. -^Enclosure 4. Translation oj letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Sir Moharak bin Suhah, K.C.I.E,, Shaikh of Kuwait, (No. 301, dated Mohammerahj the jth July /p/j ) After compliments, I have duly received your esteemed letter, dated 2nd Shaaban 1331 (= 7th July 1913), and understood its contents. I am highly obliged for your compli ance with the views of the British Government. Your Honour drew attention (in the same communication) to certain items contained in the Treaties and engagements existing between the British Govern ment and yourself. Your friend has not got the text of them here in Moham- merah, except the translation of the agreement executed between yourself and Colonel Meade, Resident in the Persian Gulf, on 23rd January 1899. The purport of that instrument is that Your Honour would not receive an agent from any foreign Government without previous reference to and the concurrence of the British Government. In the course of the present negotiation it was necessary for the British Government to acquiesce in the appointment of an Agent of the Turkish Government at Kuwait as the price of the recognition of the adminis trative autonomy of your Government and in return for the other advantages accruing to Your Excellency, as set forth in the document in question.7 Secondly, with reference to the use of the word ' successor ' (Khalaf ') instead of the word u sons ' (aolad) therein. There was no motive behind this. .For you are aware that as stipulated in the Convention, the Turkish Govern ment specifically refrains from concerning itself with this question, and agrees not to interfere in connection therewith. Consequently, in my opinion, everything that is recorded in this regard in the agreements between the British Govern ment and yourself holds good and is not altered. But, as I have not got the documents with me, I will, on arrival at Bushire after careful examination, write to Your Honour in confirmation of above, and if I see any point that arouses doubt, I will refer to Government. I am leaving to-night and I send you cordial greeting and the hope that pending our next meeting you may enjoy the best of health. (Sd.) P. z. COX.

Foreign668 — VAN IT dominant throughout Asia Minor as it was formerly in Turkey, and as Russia's influence now is throughout Persia. The remedies, in the opinion of competent authorities, must be drastic. Basra must become a strongly - fortified port and land station, a sort of Middle Eastern Gibraltar— not an ordinary fortified town, where a few regiments may be perfunctorily quartered, but a real naval base, with docks and a military depot. We must have a really strong fleet in the Persian Gulf, which is destined in time to be a miniatufC North Sea. And, above all, the whole question of the defence of the North-west frontier must be reconsidered. The period is past when we could rely upon Afghanistan, and the period has arrived when we must look for a substi tute. A substitute will not he found in forts, however ' im pregnable '—Adrianople was impregnable. Does not 76,000 seem an extraordinarily small number of British soldiers in India? If an adequate answer to this question is forth coming from the responsible authorities, the first step in the solution of the whole problem will have been taken. A Turkish Lloyd George The assassination of Mahmud Shefket Pasha is, politically speaking, disconcerting rather than tragic and irreparable. The late Turkish Grand Vizier was not the ' strong man.'' the 'force,' he was supposed to be. He was entirely under the influence of Germany, where he had been chiefly educated. During his early career as a soldier and adminis^ trator he relied almost entirely on Marshal, then General, von der Goltz Pasha; latterly he relied upon the German Ambassador in Constantinople, Baron Marschall von Bicberstein ; and also, to some extent, upon the Deutsche Bank. Despite the various attempts' made to prove that his family was Turkish, Mahmud Khcfko f an—irab; clever, impetuous, passionate, superficial, a puppet in the hands of more solid men, impressive towards the crowd. He was, in fact, a sort of Turkish Lloyd George. The Biter Bit There was more or less of ' the biter bit ' in this business. Characteristic, too. Shefket Pasha became Minister of War in 1909. Then he was driven out. When the Young Turks murdered Nazim Pasha, Mahmud Shefket reigned in his stead. Facts, these. Lessons, obvious. Next gent, please. One is quickly served these days iu Turkey. The New Turkish Masterman On the other hand, Mahmud Shefket Pasha had the immediate problems of the Turkish Empire at his finger- ends. His loss will cause as much confusion as is caused in badly organised business houses when the general manager goes for a holiday. Prince Said Halim, his successor, is as harmless as his late predecessor without being nearly so clever. In short, the Turkish Lloyd George has gone, to make way for the Turkish Masterman. The danger to the realm lies in the attitude of the Stamboul mobs, which are now disposed to attribute everything to the hated, despised, and distrusted infidel. Mahmud Shefket Again It is of interest to note, in connection with an important article in this issue on the Baghdad Eailway, that Mah mud Shefket Pasha was born in Baghdad and spent nine years in Germany and France studying war. He liked General von der Goltz's teaching. And, in passing, let us call attention to Germany's liking for the Baghdad Rail way. By the way, the chap who succeeds Mahmud Shefket is well connected, but the main point is that he has money. Money talks—in Turkey; and elsewhere.(£f3) June 18 1913 VANITY FA1E 667 TO INDIA via BAGHDAD IT does not matter how often serious emergencies arise in international affairs if only we can foresee them and take steps to meet them in advance. This elementary diplomatic axiom has been lost sight of at the Foreign Office since the days of Salisbury; and in consequence we came a nasty cropper over the annexation of Bosnia and Herze govina in 1908, when we promised to support Russia and in the end didn't; and we fell into nearly as great a 'blunder when we permitted the Italian raid on Tripoli, for it was this which led directly to the Balkan War and the European unrest of the last eight months or more. The Chinese loan is still too painful a subject to discuss; and a recent diplo matic event which has been allowed to leak out with ostentatious secrecy has reassured most people about the Baghdad Railway. And yet the strategic position resulting from the latest developments in connection with the Baghdad Railway are not very reassuring to those who are in the hal)it of trying to look further ahead than the end of next week. There's no immediate danger, and there need be no ultimate danger if adequate preparations are made in good time. This means that the matter must not be left over for indefinite consideration, as it will 'be if the attention of the Foreign Office is not called to it. Past experience has taught us at least that. The negotiations all along have ahown that the Foreign Office thought more of British trade interests in Persia and the keeping open of the sea routes to India than of the increased vulnerability of the North-West frontier after the completion of the railway. Remember those early negotia tions and intrigues. The German group secured the con cession from Abdul Hamid's government (safeguarding its profits by a most iniquitous kilometric guarantee which is too often overlooked), and the tedious undertaking was begun. Not until some time afterwards apparently did Downing Street realise that a German-owned, German-built railway some 1,200 miles long would one day terminate at the Persian Gulf, and that along its metals a ' tied ' Turkey would have to allow Triple Alliance troops to be moved. German public men talked vaguely but enthusiastically about a German port on the Gulf, the advance of the red, white and black flag, and so on. So Lord Lansdowne said, as far back as 1903 : ' We should regard the estab lishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it by all the means at our disposal.' Then it was suggested that Great Britain should bo entrusted with the construction of the last section of the line, about two hundred miles long, ending at Koweit. The Sheik of Koweit, it was pointed out, was under BritUh protection, and this was a sufficient guarantee that British interests would' be safeguarded. The plan was not by any means a perfect one—in fact, it was dangerous—but it was better than what had gone before; and Germany set tier face against it for years. She did not consent to it, indeed, until only a few weeks ago, when Viscount Morley visited Berlin. The Wilhelmstrasse authorities felt their position weakened by the virtual loss of their two allies; for Italy was engaged in Tripoli and Austria was. engaged with the new Slavdom. An agreement, approved by Germany, was accordingly entered into between England and Turkey, whereby a British group is to be entrusted with the construction and part control of the final section of the line, the administrative board to contain representa tives of France, Germany, and Turkey, in addition to the English members. The German concessionaires :iad already given up their right to the construction of this section in March, 1911, in exchange for the concession of the Alexandretta railway and other financial considerations. J his last agreement satisfied the minds of most dinlo- matists; but it really guarantees but little, and it will not satisfy the expert until he is assured that Downing Street knows what to do next. The most important suggestion made from an English source is that the termination of the line should be at Basra and not at Koweit. Koweit har bour, as anyone will remember who has seen it, would easily accommodate the entire British fleet, with a few German warships thrown in. A fortified Koweit would be an important strategic position, but it would be open to attack liom the sea by the very best and most powerful warships now being built. Basra, on the other hand, lies 65 miles from the Gulf, but is navigable by the Shatt-ul-Arab, the river formed by the junction of the Tigris and the Euphrates. But an important point is that only vessels drawing not more than 17 ft. of water can cross the bar at the Gulf, big warships being thus excluded. Now, it is clear that no British force, on land or sea, can hold Basra against an attack by land; and Koweit would be for us a still more precarious stronghold. But, in view of the Potsdam Agreement, joint action by Russia and Ger many will be by no means an impossible contingency to be reckoned with by the time the Baghdad Railway is com pleted about 1922, let us say. No one can forecast definitely what the European situation may be like then. Ihe German navy will certainly be larger; there is just a possibility that it may not be any larger relatively. The Russian navy will almost certainly be rebuilt, especially when we consider the exceedingly satisfactory budgets of the last two or three years. It is not at all certain, however, that Russia, in 1922, will still be our ally ; and there are numerous indications that she may not. The Persian question was never solved by the Anglo- Russian Convention of 1907. The Tsar's Government has no intention of resting content with the northern half of Persia when she can secure control of the whole country without much trouble. What force have we to oppose to her? A few obsolescent worships doddering up and down the Persian Gulf in search of gun-runners? Absurd. The Indian Army, it iias often been said. How many people, one wonders, actually know what the strength of the Indian army is? About 76,000 British officers and men of all classes; about 157,000 native officers and men. If we drag in the native Imperial Service troops, the native reservists, and the native police even, we may increase this straggling total to 300,000 or so. And yet there are many professed students of international politics who seriously expect this composite force to keep half a continent in order—by no means an amenable half-continent—and to tight Russia at the same time! We might as well be frank about it. If we leave things as they are at present, it will be quite possible for Russia, in ten years' time, to sweep us out of Southern Persia, just as it will be possible for Germany to sweep us out of Koweit and the Persian Gulf. For everybody knows that just as Turkey is now r ' tied ' to Germany, so is Bulgaria ' tied ' to Austria, and in a few years Teutonic influence will be as, ?&lt; [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.!

YOUR telegram No. 194 of 17tli May; Persian Gulf Anglo-Turkish negotiations. You should explain to Minister for Foreign Affairs that, so far as I am aware, there is no question of a British advance to Turkey under consideration, and certainly His Majesty's Government have not undertaken any obligation to make a separate advance to Turkey apart from the other Powers. I trust that all the Powers will, on the conclusion of peace, be prepared to use their good offices to facilitate Turkey s efforts to secure that financial assistance which will be essential for her welfare, but this has formed no part of our own negotiations with L urkey. ^ on should add that our negotiations with Turkey respecting the Persian Gulf involve no attempt to press her in her present condition, since they have been in progress lor over two years, and that from the outset the successful issue of those negotiations has been made an important condition of British assent to the Turkish customs increase. I could not possibly defend our assent to that increase (which will principally affect British trade, which amounts to (50 per cent, of the total imports in Mesopotamia) unless I had concluded our negotiations first. Apart from the Turco-Persian frontier, our political negotiations merely involve the recognition by Turkey of the status quo in the Gulf, as it has existed for a century, and the other negotiations are directed to safeguarding British commercial interests in view of the steady progress and undoubted ultimate completion of the Bagdad Railway. But British assent to the customs increase will continue to be dependent on the assent of all the Powers concerned to that measure. I have kept the Russian Ambassador informed of the progress of the Bagdad Railway negotiations, and as long ago as last summer I communicated to the Russian Government the draft of a convention respecting the Shatt-el-Arab—a convention which has since so far only been modified in unimportant details. We are in no way endeavouring to turn the misfortunes of Turkey to our own advantage, but merely to safeguard our important existing interests in view of altering local conditions.

India Office, June 2, 1913. ith reference to my telegram of the 18th April, I transmit a telegram received from the Resident, Persian Gulf :— ' L T p to the 20th instant no intimation of the terms of the draft convention as regards Koweit had been made to the Sheikh of Koweit, on account of the precarious state of his health, as has been previously reported. In view, however, of the fact that Renter's telegrams of the 17th instant, which would in the ordinary course be seen at Koweit, contained a forecast of the convention, 1 instructed the political agent to give the sheikh in an oral communication as from myself a general idea of what were considered by us to be the probable terms of the document, and at the same time to impress on him the fact that his position generally had been satisfactorily assured, for the attainment of which result it had doubtless been found necessary, as in the case of all amicable agreements, to adopt an attitude of give and take with regard to certain points of detail. A report has now been received from the political agent that the sheikh, on the whole, accepted fairly well the supremacy of Turkey, but that on the question of the residence of a Turkish agent in Koweit he expressed with the utmost strength and vehemence his absolute refusal ever to permit it. The sheikh, in a perturbed condition of mind, subsequently visited the agency, when he had slept over the matter, in order to reiterate his refusal and to request that Government should be informed of it. It was, he pointed out, expressly as a defence against this contingency that his engagements with the British Government, which had been faithfully observed, had been^concluded. The political agent has reason to think that the sheikh considers it possible that in this matter he has been sacrificed for the sake of some quid pro quo, and he is of opinion that the sheikh's resistance will yield to nothing short of the strongest coercion. He is not affected by the explanation given in the telegram of the 13th July last from the Government of India. I trust earnestly that the elimination of this item will be found possible. In the first place it is in reality a departure from the status quo, and in the second place, as has been urged, there is a Turkish representative in the person of the sheikh himself, as kaimakam. Perhaps a way of evading the difficulty would be the special appointment of one of his sons for the purpose of dealing with Turkish interests and cases. Owing to the disturbing situation that exists at Basra and Katif, we seem to have an excellent opening for warning the Turks that the sheikh has refused, and that it is dangerous to make an enemy of him in present circumstances, and important to lose no time in getting the convention settled. That an attempt will be made to get rid of or round the article by some device is my earnest hope.' [2950 6—10] Enclosure in No. 1. Government of India to the Marquess of Crewe. (Telegraphic. 'I P.

The provision for this appointment was not inserted in the draft convention without due consideration, and so far from the sheikh having been sacrificed (as he supposes) tor some quid pro quo, the admission of a Turkish agent was, in fact, part of the price pai( in order to secure the large claims made by the sheikh to the full extent to which His Maiesty's Government felt that a prima facie case could be made out for them. But it must be admitted that there is an anomaly in the appointment of a Turkish agent m a kaza of the Ottoman Empire which already has a Turkish kaimakam, and, on the Qther hand, it is difficult to overlook entirely the strong objections of the sheikh 1 he Marquess of Crewe would therefore suggest that if opportunity offers Hakki Pasha should be informed of the protest that has been made, and the Turkish Government be urged in view of the general situation in Arabia and the undesirability of throwing the sheikh into the arms of Bin Saud, to let the appointment remain in abeyance for the time being, and—in the first instance, at all events—to appoint one of the sheikh s sons, as suggested by Sir P.

In view, however, of the fact that Renter's telegrams of the 17th instant, which would in the ordinary course be seen at Koweit, contained a forecast of the convention, I instructed the political agent to give the sheikh, in an oral communication as from myself, a general idea of what were con sidered by us to be the probable terms of the document, and at the same time to impress on him the fact that his position generally had been satisfactorily assured, for the attainment of which result it had doubtless been found necessary, as in the case of all amicable agreements, to adopt an attitude of give-and-take with regard to certain noints of detail. A report has now been received from the political agent that the sheikh, on the whole, accepted fairly well the supremacy of Turkey, but that on the question oftheresidenceofa Turkish agent in Koweit he expressed with the utmost strength and vehemence his absolute refusal ever to permit it. The sheikh in a perturbed condition of mind, subsequently visited the agency, when he had slept over the matter, in order to reiterate his refusal and to request that Government should be informed of it. It was, he pointed out, expressly as a defence against this contingency that his engagements with the British Government, which had been faithfully observed, had been concluded. The political agent has reason to think that the sheikh considers * Draft of telegram. [2950 e—4]it possible that in this matter hie has been sacrificed for the sake of some quid pro quo, and he is of opinion that the sheikh's resistance will yield to nothing short of the strongest coercion. He is not affected by the explanation given in the telegram of the 13th July last Irom the Goverment of India. I trust earnestly that the elimination of this item will be found possible. In the first place, it is in reality a departure from the status quo, and, in the second place, as has been urged, there is a Turkish representative in the person of the sheikh himself as kaimakam. Perhaps a way of evading the difficulty would be the special appointment of one of his sons for the purpose of dealing with Turkish interests and cases. Owing to the disturbing situation that exists at Basra and Katif we seem to have an excellent opening for warning the Turks that the sheikh has refused and that it is dangerous to make an enemy of him in present circumstances, and important to lose no time in getting the convention settled, lhat an attempt will be made to get rid of or round the article by some device is my earnest hope.'[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.J [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

IN amplification of my telegram of the 10th instant, in connection with Koweit negotiations, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the political agent's report (with accompanying map*) on which it was based. No further comment on it seems called for at this stage. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Captain Shakespear to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox. (Confidential.) Koweit, April 0, 1913. I HAVE the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence regarding the Anglo-Turkish negotiations relating to the status of Kovveit. ending with the Govern ment of India telegram in the Foreign Department, dated the 15th April, 1913. 2. You are aware that I returned to head-quarters on the 21st April to find Sheikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah dangerously ill. He is now recovering slowly, but I have not found it possible up to date to say more on the subject than to state that his letter and enclosure to your address had been forwarded to the Government, that as the conclusion of the war was in sight it was hoped negotiations would soon be actively taken up, and that you have asked Government to keep you informed as to their course ; also that 1 did not consider paragraphs appearing in the Basra papers could give reliable informa- ^ tion of matters which were the subject of confidential negotiations between the British and Turkish Governments, and on which we had not yet received a pronouncement from Government. 3. On one occasion, when I visited the sheikh before I had received copies of Foreign Office print dated the 26th March, your telegram of the 3rd April, and Foreign Department telegram referred to above, the sheikh mentioned that he had received news from Basra to the effect that the British and Turkish Governments had agreed upon Koweit autonomy, and that he was perfectly satisfied, for all his claims had been recognised. The sheikh's condition then being serious, 1 said no more than that I doubted the authenticity of his information, or that the Porte could have receded so completely from a position which some time ago I knew showed a wide divergence from his claims. A few days later I obtained a copy of the ' Dastur (published in Basra), which contained a paragraph in its issue of the 12th Jamadi-al- Awal, 1331 (16th April, 1913), practically identical with what the sheikh had told me. I attach, for information, a rough translation of the paragraph, which, I may add, was also received with as much satisfaction by the Koweit public as the sheikh. It will be obvious, however, that this satisfaction is based on a vastly different conception ot Koweit autonomy from that disclosed in the draft agreement of the Foreign Office print [2950 r—o] * Not reproduced.of the 26th March. I shall, however, take the first opportunity made possible by the sheikh's improvement in health to prepare him for the fact that he must expect a considerable alteration in his present view of the position. 4. Meanwhile, I venture to submit, for consideration, the following points, trusting that even now it may not be too late to obtain better terms for the sheikh : As a result of my recent tour, I have been able to lay down with some accuracy the position of wells and other features to the south-west of Koweit by which the sheikh s southern boundary is determined. The sheikh claims to include the Al-Gara'a and Al-Haba wells, and all the information I have been able to collect points to the fact that his claim is justly founded. I have attached herewith the confidential ' Map of the Koweit Hinterland,' with the doubtful portion in the south corrected from my latest tours, and would invite a comparison with the same map uncorrected in your office as likely to be useful. By far the strongest argument in support of the sheikh's claim, however, is the actual situation of the wells themselves, laking the Ai-ITaba wells as a centre, and striking a semi-circle of 90 miles radius from east round by south to west, discloses the fact that in the whole of the intervening country there is not a single well, and that the nearest, wells to the southward lie on this semi-circle, viz., those of Awaina, on the east, situate 27 miles south of Anta'a, next those of Hafar-al-Ats, almost due south from Al-Haba, and those of Gaiyiya (at 105 miles), south-west of Al-Haba. It may be taken for granted that nomad Arabs recognise authority in the desert according to wells, and never in all my tours have I heard it suggested that the wells of Hafar, As-Safa, Al-Gara'a, and Al-Haba (all along the sheikh's southern boundary) were not in Koweit territory and jurisdiction. How 1 came to omit the Al-Haba wells from my previous report, dated the 12th August, 1912, I cannot now understand. I have marked in blue pencil what is undoubtedly the actual boundary on the attached corrected map. As I have traversed personally the whole of this district, obtained my information from Bedouin camping actually on the spot, and myself produced what map there is of the tract, I claim that my opinion is entitled at least to as much weight as the assertions of the Turkish Government, which has no real or first hand knowledge of the area, facts, or conditions as they actually exist. 5. While I am fully aware that an agreement with Turkey regarding Koweit can be reached only by compromise, I venture to submit with all deference that it is worth while, in our own interests, to consider how any compromise is likely to be regarded by the ruler of Koweit and his people, and its probable effect on our relations. It must be recollected that the sheikh has not been informed of the course of the negotiations, nor of the Turkish demands, nor of our suggestions or concessions thereto—he has left his case in our hands, with the expectation that we will at least see his just demands satis fied. Consequently, we shall have to bear the odium and any resentment resulting from such disappointment as may follow from the agreement falling short of the sheikh's expectations. I have shown in previous reports and above what can fairly be considered Koweit boundaries, and now propose to state what I feel convinced would be the really genuine objections the sheikh would advance to the draft agreement on the Foreign Office print dated the 26th March, if it were communicated to him. 6. Taking the draft agreement by articles seriatim— (a.) Article 1 may be passed by as without objection. (b.) In article 2 the objection is that the title of kai'makam is a very inferior one and connotes that Koweit territory is merely a ' qadha.' An almost exact parallel would be furnished by calling the sheikh a deputy-commissioner or collector under the Indian Government and his territory a ' district.' When it is added that a Turkish kaimakam's annual salary amounts to 135Z. to 270Z. only, and the position indicated thereby is contrasted with the fact that the sheikh has hitherto enjoyed almost complete independence, been accorded a salute of twelve guns by British men-of-war and always been addressed officially as ' Kuler of Koweit,' the depreciation of his position under the draft agreement may be realised in some measures. Further, though Turkish officials address him as kaimakarn and add the title of pasha, the sheikh himself does not acknowledge the style, and invariably describes himself as ' Ruler of Koweit and Chief of its Tribes.' I venture to think that we should stipulate for Koweit to be described at least as a sanjak and its ruler as a mutesarrif, of which the Indian equivalents would be a division and a commissioner. The question of the continuance of a salute to the sheikh would also seem to be involved in our recognition of whatever Turkish title or rank may be selected. (c.) Article 3 defines complete autonomy sufficiently clear.(d.) Article 4 permits the appointment of a Turkish agent, and has the most serious objections. The sheikh has not dreamt of such a possibility, and, I am sure, would object most strongly to the idea. He could doubtless be compelled to receive one, but the pressure would have to be applied through, with the consent of, or perhaps even directly by, the British Government. The effect on our relations with, and our interests in, Koweit of forcing the representative of an undesired Power upon an unwilling ruler and people may be easily imagined. There is further to be reckoned with the inevitable and recurrent intrigues which will result from the residence of a Turkish official in Koweit. My own opinion is that the Turkish agent, if permitted, will either be regarded as a spy by the ruling sheikh of the time or be utilised by him in intrigues and efforts to play off the Turkish and British Governments against each other for his own ends. (e.) Articles 5, 6, and 7 require to be considered together with the map. In the first place, the division of his territory into two portions, over which he and the Turkish Government will have authority different in degree and kind, will be unintelligible to the sheikh, and will, moreover, lead to constant friction, for the inner segment defined in article 5 has no naturally-definable boundary, and is a paper arrange ment which the sheikh will be unable to maintain in the exercise of his authority throughout the wnole of the two portions over which at present it is identical in character. Secondly, the suggested difference will furnish the Bedouin tribes subject to the sheikh and the Turkish authorities with endless opportunities for petty intrigues and friction, particularly if permission for a Turkish agent, as suggested in article 4, is accorded. Assuming the best intentions on the part of the l urkish Government and its officials, intrigue remains as the breath of life to Bedouin, and the suggested division of his territory will undoubtedly hamper the Ruler of Koweit in his dealings with the tribes. I would suggest that the sheikh's complete autonomy as defined in article 3 should extend to the limits described in article 7, modified so far as may be considered possible by the information I have given above in para graph 4. The alternative southern boundary given in a starred foot-note to article 7 is useless from the sheikh's point of view for reasons already given in paragraph 4 above, and, moreover, is not desired by him. In this connection it would seem desirable that the evacuation of the Turkish posts on Bubian Island and Um Kasr should be ensured either by the present agreement, or, if preferred, separately if that at Safwan is allowed to remain. It will be clear from reports ever since the occupation of these posts in 1902 that the sheikh would have taken measures to eject the Turks but for being restrained by British assurances that we had not lost sight of the matter. The stipulations in article 6 prohibiting Turkey from stationing garrisons or taking military or naval action within Koweit boundaries should be maintained. (f.) Article 8 requires no comment. ((/.) Article 9 requires no comment beyond that I believe the sheikh has already succeeded in obtaining legal recognition for his landed properties in that permission is said to have been granted for their registration in his own name without the formality of taking out a Turkish ' nafas tazkireh.' (h.) Article 10 would, lam certain, be most strongly opposed by the sheikh for the reasons given in Residency telegram dated the 28th March. 1913. If some such clause is strongly pressed for, it might be worded so as to permit the passage of lurkish troops to NejcTby no route nearer to Koweit than the caravan road passing along the western boundary from Basra by the Batin depression to Hafar wells. 7. Though the foregoing may be said to be largely destructive criticism of the diaft agreement, I have endeavoured to show how that agreement may be made some^ hat less unpalatable to the sheikh. Unpalatable it will be and will remain for yeats, e\en with the emendations I have suggested, but it seems to me that in treating w ith the Turkish Government we have hardly given the sheikh s irrefutable rights the consideration due to them, for his claim has throughout been founded on a just minimum of existing facts which we have been at some pains to investigate ourselves, whilst in our desire to meet the Porte, we have shown a benevolent sympathy to their vague, extravagant, and nebulous claims, unsupported as they are by any real evidence, which they do not merit. That we may obtain a quid pro quo elsewhere does not afiect Koweit, for the sheikh will judge the agreement as it touches himself and his people, and inasmuch as he has left his whole case unreservedly in our hands, he will be the more inclined to resent any serious diminution of his territory, prestige, rights, or privileges. The whole force of such resentment will certainly recoil upon us, morerA 1 7 especially were the idea to obtain that we had benefited in some other sphere, and it is because I feel so strongly that the advent of any bitterness in our very cordial relations with the Ruler of Koweit should be avoided as far as may be possible that I have ventured to submit the above paragraphs for consideration. Sheikh Mubarak has been far more loyal and straightforward in his dealings with us than we could have anticipated from an oriental chief of so little education, and therefore merits the most benevolent consideration of his claims at our hands, more particularly when we are negotiating regarding them practically without consulting him, the party most interested.

PERSIA. |- 15th A p ri i,j CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. 16898 No. 1. Memorandum communicated to Hakki Pasha. The line proposed by His Highness Hakki Pasha, in his communication of the 7th instant, as that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, begins at the point where the Shatt-i-Niasan leaves the Khor-el-Azam. His Majesty's Government would prefer the point previously recommend ed by them, i.e., where the Khor-el-Muhaisin joins the Khor-el-Azam. In yiew 5 however, of the wish expressed by the Turkish Government that the frontier in this region should lie further to the east, His Majesty's Government would be willing to agree to a line starting from the place known as Unun- Chir, where the Khor-el-Donvil leaves the Khor-el-Azam. The position of Unun-Chir is accurately known, and is nine miles to the east of the point previously recommended by His Majesty's Government (the junction of the Khor-el-Muhaisin and the Khor-el-Azam), and nine miles to the north-west of Bisaitin, a place situated on latitude 31° 43' 29 ,/ . From Unun-Chir the line proceeds in a south-westerly direction, and joins at longitude 45° the line previously recommended by His Majesty's Government at the southern extremity of the small sheet of open water, apparently also known as Azam which is to be found in the Khor-el-Azam at some distance north-west of Shnaile. Prom this point the line continues south, as previously recommended bv Mis Majesty's Government, but stops at latitude 31°, when it is deflected due east, and continues along that parallel to a point just north-east of Kushk-i- Basrah, thus including that spot in Turkish territory. This compromise is made as a proof of the friendly desire of His Majesty's Government, who it appears are anxious that Kusbk-i-Basrah should be recognised as Turkish. ' ' Irom the point just mentioned the line proceeds south, strikin 0, the Shatt-el-Arab at the point originally proposed by His Majesty's Government and continuing to follow the direction recommended by them throughout the remainder of its course. As regards the reference in Hakki Pasha's communication to the position of Bahne, it would appear that the island cited by His Highness as passin^ under that name is the more northern of the two islands lying between Muhalla (or Ilajji Salbuk) and the right hank of the Shatt-el-Arab (the more southern island being known as Gata), while the island marked as Bahrie on the map enclosed in Sir E. Grey's note of the 18th July last is the more southern of the two islands lying between Muhalla and the left bank. As the first-mentioned Babrie baa not been claimed for Persia, nor the last-mentioned for Turkey, it is unnecessary further to discuss this point. Foreign OffiGe &gt; 15th April 1913.

I said that I thought that all the concession beyond Baghdad had already been given up in return for concessions made by Turkey elsewhere, especially in the neighbourhood of Alexandretta; and that Turkey was now entitled to build the railway beyond Baghdad as she liked, provided that, if she asked for any foreign participation, she gave Germany as large a share as any other country. I did not, therefore, see how Turkey could again have to pay an indemnity for the giving up of any part of a concession as regards which she had already purchased her freedom of action, subject to the condition of parti cipation of German capital which I had stated. I had, however, been unable to attend to any details of this subject lately, and I would ask the Ambassador either to discuss them with Sir Louis Mallet or to authorise Herr von Kiihlmann to discuss them. The Ambassador also said that the Deutsche Bank hoped that we would give support on the commission in Paris as to the replacement of securities lost during the war which were pledged to the Baghdad Railway.

Minute by Mr. Parker. I called at the German Embassy to-day and Herr von Kiihlmann explained to me the views of the German Government in regard to certain matters touching the Baghdad Railway, Turkish finance and river navigation in Mesopotamia. I asked him to allow me to make notes, as the subjects are involved, and I pointed out that I had come to listen to his remarks and had of course no proposals to make. The substance of his remarks was as follows;— 1. The Baghdad Railway Company would prefer to build and manage the section from Baghdad to Basrah themselves rather than abandon that section to another company. The company did not, under the arrange ment of 1911, definitely abandon their rights to do this; they at that time merely made a declaration of their readiness to do so subject to two condi tions, viz. : that the Baghdad Railway Company's interest in the new company should be equal to that of any nation other than Turkey, and that the Baghdad Railway Company should receive compensation for the renunciation of rights secured to them under the original concession. 2. If His Majesty's Government agree to point (1), then the Soci&amp;e would be prepared to agree that— (») The sections from Basrah to the Gulf should be indefinitelv nost- poned. (&amp;) If those sections ever should be built, the Soci^te would like to share in the building of them, but would not ask to share in the subsequent management of the sections, but there must be adequate guarantees as regards through traffic. (c) That Basrah should be the terminus of the line.{(J) That the construction and control of the port at Basrali should be the subject of an agreement with His Majesty's Government. (e) That two British directors should be admitted to the Board of the llailway from Konia to Basrah. 3. The German Government would confirm these proposals of the Soci^te. They would also agree that German subjects should make no claim to participate in navigation on the Euphrates and Tigris. If a reasonable and fair arrangement can be made for the conveyance of materials for the railway while building, then the Germans would forthwith abandon any claim to navigation on those rivers. If, however, for some technical reason, such an arrangement cannot be made as regards building material, &amp;c., then the German Government w r ould undertake that German subjects shall not parti cipate in any navigation compauv on the two rivers after, say, five years from 1913. 4. If the German Government and the Societe agree that the terminus shall be Basrah, they will expect an undertaking from His Majesty's Govern ment and the Ottoman Government that the Shatt-el-Arab shall be kept in a satisfactory state of conservancy, so that sea-going vessels without discrimina tion of flag shall always be assured of easy access to Basrah on equal conditions. 5. The German Government would appreciate a confidential intimation as to the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the Baghdad Railway enterprise on the conclusion of such an arrangement as that in question. 6. The German Government wishes co-operation between the German and British delegates on the Financial Commission at Paris, so as to secure— (a) Tliat the Baghdad Railway Company shall receive fresh and equally good security for any revenues now pledged to the company and which Turkey may forfeit as the result of the war {e.g., the Saionica customs duties surplus). (b) That, in the arrangements about to be made 'for Turkish financial reorganisation, adequate revenues shall be earmarked for the securities of the Baghdad-Basrah section.

With respect to these agreements His Majesty's Government have the following observations to make :— A .s regards No. 1, His Majesty's Government have informed the Shaikh of Kuwait that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obliga tions under the agreement, His Majesty's Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty's Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. His Majesty's Government bold, moreover, a lease of land from the Shaikh of Kuwait. As regards No. 4, His Majesty's Government take occasion to remind the Sublime Porte that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, and transmitted herewith to the Ottoman Government, but on the custom, consent and long-established relations between the local chiefs and the Government of India. His Majesty's Government hope that in the communication of these agreements, together with the supplementary declarations which are hereby brought to the notice of the Ottoman Government, the Sublime Porte will see proof of His Majesty's Government's goodwill and desire to facilitate the conclusion oi the negotiations set forth in their above-mentioned memorandum, I have, &amp;c,, E.

In accordance with Sir A. Nicolson's instructions I saw Herr von Kiihlmann again to-day, I said that we had to-day communicated a statement (of which, for facility of reference, I attach a copy) to Hakki Pasha about the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris. I explained to Herr von Kiihlmann the substance of the paragraphs printed in italics, and I said that we had worded these paragraphs in such a manner, because we did not wish at this stage to divulge to Hakki Pasha that the Germans had told us that they would disinterest themselves in the river ; though we should of course count on their doing so if the proposals Herr von Kiihlmann had communicated to me on the 7th May were accepted. He said he fully appreciated the course we had adopted ; and he under stood the true inwardness of the wording used in the communication to Hakki Pasha. After some general conversation, I said to him that a rumour had reached us, both from Baghdad and through a certain Heir Buete in London (though I asked him not to mention Herr Buete's name), that the Baghdad Railway Company were contemplating a change of trace for the main line from Mosul to Baghdad, so as to pass via Khanikine. I said that we did not wish to be inquisitive, but the alteration if made would of course be important, and we should be glad if the Germans could give us any information on the point. He said he did not know, but that he would telegraph to Berlin to enquire: I ^ asked him not to telegraph, as the matter did not press.101 He then said that he would like to warn me about Herr Ruete : he was a perfectly honest, though somewhat garrulous individual; he had no direct con nection with the Deutsche Bank, but was anxious de se faire valoi^, ,, and he was a great friend of Mr. Lynch. He was, moreover, always preaching in the German press on the theme that the Baghdad Railway should stop at Baghdad and not go on to Basrah,—ideas which Herr von Kuhlmann thought might be traced to the financial interests of Mr. Lynch. As a matter of fact, the Baghdad Railway Company and the Deutsche Bank, and the German Govern ment, attached the greatest importance to the construction of the Baghdad-Basrah section : he thought it well to make it plain that Herr Ruete had no sort of mandate from either the German Government or the Deutsche Bank to negotiate on railway questions. I replied to Herr von Kuhlmann that this applied equally, mutatis mutandis^ to Mr. Lynch. Be had no authority to enter into any negotiations about the railway on the part of His Majesty's Government, and anything he might say should be treated with great circums pection. Herr von Kuhlmann then told me that some years ago he had noticed that a great deal of the opposition to the Baghdad Railway in the English press emanated from Mr. Lynch, and he had accordingly recommended the Company to give Mr. Lynch a job ; consequently the arrangement had been made for Mr. Lynch's steamers to convey material for constructing the railway, and since then Mr. Lynch had become strongly in favour of Anglo-German co-operation, and the press agitation had diminished. A. P. Foreign Office, 9tk May 1913, Enclosure in No. 1. Statement communicated to Hakki Paaha, 9th May 1913. (Confidential.) We have been asked by Hakki Pasha to consider whether His Majesty's Government would prefer a solution of the river navigation question on the lines of— (1) the draft Convention already discussed, or (2) the abortive Lynch Convention of 1909, or (3) the maintenance of the existing British Company as a separate enterprise, and, subject to the maintenance of its rights, the grant of a concession to a new Ottoman Company jointly controlled and financed, of exclusive rights of steam navigation on the rivers. It is obvious that so much must depend on the details of any scheme that only a provisional indication of views can be given at the present stage. Subject, however, to the satisfactory adjustment of the detailed arrangements, we are at present disposed towards a solution on the lines of the third alter native, which will have the advantage of avoiding the difficulty of the flag. As regards the composition of the new Ottoman Company, Hakki JPasha suggested a tripartite arrangement under which one-third of the capital would he Turkish, one-third British, and one-third would be supplied hy the Belgian Company for the transport of materials for the Baghdad Railway. As the capital of the last-named Company is half British and half German, the effect of this would be that half the capital would be British, one-third Turkish, and one-sixth German, As regards this proposed division of capital, we must he free to arrange with the Germans as to the allocation between the two countries of the Anglo- German share. In the event of the Germans foregoing their share, we should Jje willing that this should be divided equally between Great Britain and Turkey,102 The limits and period of the concession should be generally on the lines already discussed between us. It would no doubt be necessary to provide some means whereby a fair share of the future expansion of the trade of the rivers would be carried by the British Company, which otherwise might find itself driven out by the competition of the new Company. If an arrangement on the above lines commends itself to the Imperial Ottoman Government, it will probably be sufficient to make it the subject of a declaration, leaving the details of the concession to be worked out between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the concessionnaire. It would be useful if some indication could be given of the payment which the Imperial Ottoman Government would expect in return for transferring to the new Company its interests in the navigation of the rivers.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter^ dated the 9th May 1913. 20662—13 Foreign Office, (Immediate and Confidential.) N 9th May 1913. Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you, for the con-* fidential information of the Board of Trade, a copy of a memorandum com municated by His Highness Hakki Pasha on the 1st instant, setting forth the various points to which the Ottoman Government desire to secure the assent of His Majesty's Government. As regards point 1, it will be observed that the Turkish Government ask for the assent of His Majesty's Government to an increase in the customs duties not for a limited period, but for an indefinite one. It has been urged in the negotiations by Hakki Pasha that if the increase were limited, say for a period of seven years, as His Majesty's Government proposed in their note of July 1912 to the Turkish Ambassador, the Turkish Government would not be able to make full use of such an increase as security for advances. Subject to the assent of all the Powers concerned being obtained to a permanent increase. Sir E. Grey is disposed to concur in the request of the Turkish Government. He would, however, be glad to receive the views of your Department on this point; and, inasmuch as it was originally proposed that the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Convention should be subject to denun ciation after twenty-one years so as to coincide with the expiry of a period (say, the third of seven years) for which His Majesty's Government would have given their assent to the levy of customs duties at fifteen per cent, ad valorem, the question now arises whether His Majesty's Government should not stipulate that, if they assent to the levy in question for an indefinite^ period, the Shatt-el-Arab Convention should not be modified so as to remain103 in force for at any rate a longer period than twenty-one years. Sir E. Grey would propose eventually to substitute fifty for twenty-one years in the draft Convention, but he desires in the first instance to be furnished with the views of the Board of Trade and India Office. As regards point 2, this is a matter which principally concerns your Department. Subject to any views you may express, Sir E. Grey is disposed to reply that in principle His Majesty's Government will agree to a specific tariff if the other Powers do so; but that the details must be the subject of negotiation and mutual accommodation. In regard to this subject, however, I am to refer to your letter No. C.—3754 of the 6th instant. I am also to state that Sir H. Crawford is understood to be in favour of a specific tariff in Turkey. ««««»*«» The Secretary to the Board of Trade.

Sir, I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th May, transmitting copy of a memorandum communicated by Hakki Pasha on the 1st May, setting forth certain proposals to which the Ottoman Government desire to obtain the assent of His Majesty's Govern ment, and to offer the following observations thereon. As regards the increase of the Turkish customs duties from 11 per cent, to 15 cent, ad valorem^ the Board recognise that there is force in the con siderations urged by Hakki Pasha, to which you refer, and they are disposed to concur in Sir E. Grey's opinion that the proposed limitation of the period during which the increased duties are to be in force might be waived. They agree further that, should that course be adopted, an effort should be made to secure fifty years as a minimum period for the duration of the Shatt-el-Arab conservancy. As regards the proposed conversion of the Turkish customs tariff from an ad valorem to a specific basis, it appears from enquiries which the Board have caused to be made that such a change would not be regarded altogether favourably by British traders, but the Board are nevertheless of opinion that, should the proposed change meet with the approval of the other Powers, it would be difficult for His Majesty's Government to resist it in principle. I am to suggest, however, for Sir E. Grey's consideration, that it should be stipulated that the details of any such tariff must be previously agreed between the two countries, and further that no such tariff should be put into operation without a reasonable period of notice. ******* I have, &amp;c., H.

This morning I explained the position of the Baghdad Kail way negotia tions with Turkey to the Russian and French Ambassadors here. A Dralt Convention with Turkey has heen initialled ad referendum according to which we waive our claim to participate in construction of the railway line up to Basrah, on condition that without our consent the line does not proceed beyond Basrah, and also on condition that two British Directors are on board of the Baghdad Railway Company from Urmia to the terminus. The latter condition has been added in order to insure against establishment of differen tial rates. Germany has asked that her delegates at the Financial Cummission at Paris may be supported -by us in their ett'ort to find securities for the Baghdad-Basrah section and also to secure revenues to replace those she will lose in the territories in Europe that have been ceded to the Balkan allies and which were affected to the Baghdad Railway, and she has intimated that on these conditions she would be willing to consent to our arrangement with Turkey. We have made no reply to this suggestion as yet. The Turkish Govern, inent have not yet formed a new company to replace the German Company, and therefore the right of the Baghdad Railway Company to construct the line from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf still holds good. If the German Govern ment raise the question of the Baghdad-Khanikin line, I shall reply that it is a matter which concerns the Russian Government, but so far Germany has not broached the matter to us.

The German press has been somewhat exercised in its mind as to the negotiations being carried on in London between His Majesty's Government and the Porle on the subject of Kuwait and the Baghdad Railway, especially as to the manner in which German interests will be affected. According to some press reports Germany has given her consent to the arrangement, while other papers maintain that the agreement bears an Anglo-Russian character and was concluded over Germany's head. Conspicuous among these iatter papers is the 44 Vossische Zeitung,' which publishes a telegram from its Paris correspondent to the effect that a new treaty has been concluded between His Majesty's Government and Turkey, giving to the former paramount influence over the Basrah-Kuwait section of the Baghdad Railway. *' In return for this,' the telegram continues, 'England undertakes to build up the harbour of Basrah, which is of great importance to the Baghdad Railway. On the Turco-Persian frontier Turkey cedes the territory of Urmia, a 'concession obtained by England in the interests of Kussia, in return for Russian support.' The telegram concludes by outlining the other provisions of the agreement, including the reforms in Anatolia and Syria promised by Turkey. In commenting on its correspondent's telegram, the ' Vossisehe Zeitun?,' after expressing the hope that England's role of honest broker during the Balkan crisis was not prompted by self-interest, and after admitting that the above-mentioned terms contain in themselves nothing objectionable to106 Germanv. says that it will be impossible to judge whether England has been playing fair in the Kuwait question till the badly-needed German ollicial statement on the subject appears. This official statement has now appeared in the form of the following telegram to tbe ' Kolnische Zeitung' : ' The press has been busy discussing the negotiations now in progress between England and Turkey about the Baghdad Railway. The two Govern ments have hitherto made nothing known as to the trend of these n^goiicitions, though it may even now be statecl that the view is incoriect that the Anglo- Turkish negotiations will prejudicially affect German interests.

[21st May.] CONFIDENTIAL. - S ection 2. 23501 No - 1- Minute by Mr. Parker. Sir A. Nicolson, Herr Kiihlmann came to see me yesterday and, after saying he had ascertained that there was no intention, as we had heard, to deflect the main line of the Baghdad Railway at Mosul, he proceeded to mention what he described as ' one or two points of detail' regarding our original conversation of the 7th May. As Sir E. Grey had warned me before that I was not to discuss any fresh proposals, I told Herr Kiihlmann that I would merely listen to what he had to say and report it. Since some of his points of detail ' are to the advantage of Germany, I think it is very desirable that Sir E. Grey should have this minute, and my original record of Herr Kuhlmann's proposals, before him when he sees Herr Kuhlmann to-morrow. It will be recollected that Herr Kuhlmann has accepted that record as an accurate version of his proposals, and a copy of it is annexed. The important point to bear in mind is that paragraph 6 does not enter as a condition of the proposed written agreement with Germany: I was particularly careful to keep it out by the wording of my minute. The suggested conditions of the bargain with Germany are to be found only in paragraphs 1 to 4 of my record. When he came on the 20th May, Herr Kuhlmann said he understood the German Company would 'prefer to build the port of Basrah alone. (This is intelligible from the German standpoint, but we should prefer to participate owing to our special interest in the river and for other reasons.) The Germans, he said, would like the conditions for controlling the port at Basrah to be the same as those which exist at Haidar Pasha (opposite Con stantinople). He would explain those conditions later. If we did exercise any share of control, he said he would prefer that it should be done through the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Commission. {Vrimd facie, there seems no objection to this, but it must be fully looked into.)107 m The German Government could not absolutely prohibit any German subject from buvinsr shnres in the new navigation company, or even liom en_ &gt; &lt;i_,in r , in navigation, but they would undertake not to ' encourage or support any German subject in taking part in the navigation. Hie German Government hoped, however, for the sake of public opinion, that the word monopoly might be avoided in the agreement with Turkey. I said I would report his remarks, but that the monopoly was the essence of the whole thing, just as in effect the Germans tiad a monopoly on the railway, and I said it seemed to me impossible to secure our object if the word were omitted. He said the German Government hoped w r e would agree to give an undertaking that there should be no discrimination between the different nations in regard to river traffic rates. (This is quite reasonable.) Then he said that, if the company agreed to the' indefinite postponement of the line from Basrah to the Gulf, it would require financial compensation from|the Turkish Government for that section (100 miles or so). (I he Germans seem to intend to squeeze the poor Turks, but this is not our business.) Lastly, he said that the company wished not merely to secure the alloca tion of specific revenues for the main lineup to Basrah, but also for the branches (which include the Khanikin branch). He said this was a detail which need not be specially brought to Sir E. Grey's attention, but it is owing to the introduction of the Khanikin branch, a very important detail, and however important the construction of the Khanikin branch may be as an artery or British trade, there seems little doubt that llussia will oppose any attempt on Germany's part to secure the immediate allocation of revenues for this branch, as the date of completion of that branch has an important effect on Russia a obligations under the Potsdam agreement. The Baghdad Railway Company is of course already entitled, under the original concession of 19 to secure the allocation of revenues for that branch eventually, but I think we should stipulate with Herr Kiihlmann that, having regard to the exhausted financial condition of Turkey at the moment, the company should be content if they secure the allocation of revenues for the main line up to Basrah, leaving the branches till a later date. Otherwise there will be a sharp divergence ot opinion in the Financial Commission at Paris. Meanwhile, it seems important to maintain the position that the question of securing the allocation of revenues for the railway does not enter as a condition expressis verbis into our bargain with Germany. All that Herr Kuhlmann asked on the 7th May was a sort of collateral assurance that we would help them to get security for the main line to Basrah. It seems very desirable to tie the Germans down as soon as possible to their undertaking about the river navigation, lest they should whittle it away, and I venture to suggest that a Draft Agreement should be prepared ad referendum* 21st May 1913.

W e had made up our minds that nothing could ' ~ ^' • Also to Mr. O'beirue (No. JJ05).108 prevent the railway from cooing to Basrali,and we had decided that the point for us to safeguard was that the status quo in the Persian Gulf should not be disturbed. An agreement, ad referendum, had therefore been drawn up with a representative of the Turkish Government, under which there were provisions about Kuwait, Bahrain, El Katr, and so forth % for securing tlie status quo in the Persian Gulf, provisions about the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab, and a stipulation that the Baghdad Railway should not go beyond Basrah without our consent. We had not claimed participation in the Baghdad Railway, but were to have two directors on the board of the railway from Konieh to Basrah. These directors would, of course, not be able to exercise control, but they would be able to see that, in practice as well as in theory, there was no differentiation of rates on British goods. They would be able to let us know if any such differentiation did take place, in which case we should make diplomatic representatious. Since we had made this arrangement with Hakki Pasha, the German Government had begun to speak to us on the subject. Apparently, they were entitled to claim from Turkey that the Baghdad Railway should, in one way or another, be continued to the Persian Gulf ; and they said that, there fore, Turkey could not foroge without their consent the right to make the railway from Basrah to the Gulf. But this consent they were willing to give if there was no opposition to the railway being made to Basrah, and if they could be assured that the financial guarantees for making the line up to Baghdad, which would be lost by the cession of Turkish territory in Europe to the allies, would be replaced, and if further guarantees were secured to carry the line on to Basrah. This was a matter that would come before the Pinancial Commission in Paris, and I could not commit myself to the German Government without first discussing the matter with the French and Russian Governments. We were now r satisfied that, if the railway did not go bevond Basrah, we need not regard it as being prejudicial to British interests, and we need not oppose it. The Erench Ambassador was under the impression that we had secured the right to build the section from Basrah to the Gulf, and had been offered the Baghdad-Khanikin branch. I assured him that this was rot so. We bad not acquired any right to build any section, and we had no participation. It was true that something had been said by an unauthorised German to Mr. Lynch, who was also an unauthorised person, as far as these negotiations were concerned, about giving us the branch from Baghdad to Khanikin. But I had discouraged any idea of such a proposal being brought into the discussion, as it seemed to me to affect the arrangement that Russia had made at Potsdam—an arrangement that was connected with the Khanikin branch, I am, &amp;c., E.

[June 10.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 7. [27274] No. 1. Note hy Captain Wilson regarding the proposed provision for the Extradition from Koweit of persons wanted hy the Turks. [N.B.—The word ' extradition ' is used for convenience only : it is scarcely applicable in its strict sense.] THE following notes represent, I believe, generally speaking, the view of the question that would be taken by Sir P. Cox : I have written without reference to records, however, and subject to correction on all points :— 1. Extradition has been refused by the sheikh in the past to the Turkish authorities, a nd cases are on renord at Bus hire where the demand has been made by the authorities of Basra, not complied with by the sheikh and not pressed by the lurks.^ The existing status quo certainly does not provide for it, and on this ground I think we should V resist any formal demand for it. 2. The Sheikh of Koweit could not possibly enforce extradition on his dependants ^ V on the drastic scale provided for in Hakki Pasha's draft, and his personal prerogatives in such a matter are strictly limited by immemorial Arab custom and local observance. 3. The indiscriminate extradition of accused persons is contrary to well-known and almost universally recognised Arab (and Mohammedan) custom ; whether provided for in our agreement or not,-it cannot in practice be observed locally and can only lead to friction and give local Turkish authorities occasion to pick quarrels with the sheikh. A useful case to quote in support of the above contention might be the murder by Arabs in 1904 of a Bahrein notable whilst hunting on Turkish territory in Hasa. ^ My recollection is that when we demanded the surrender of the guilty parties the Turks pleaded that the malefactors had taken refuge with an Arab tribe who refused to give them up, and that the Turkish authorities were not in a position to insist on their surrender. 4. Hakki Pasha's draft provides for extradition of any persons wanted by the Turkish provincial authorities whether Turkish subjects or not, and whether accused of serious crime or of petty civil misdemeanour ; nor does it provide for any reciprocal obligation on the part of the Turks. In all these respects it will certainly be -r unacceptable and unworkable. Turkey has refused ' extradition ' (the capitulations notwithstanding) to Great Britain ; sheTias also generally in practice refused it to Persia, in spite of the specific provisions of the treaties of 1746 and 1823. The fact is, the principle of extradition is repugnant to eastern ideas. S if? V-\ 5. My impression is that Hakki Pasha's draft goes far beyond the provisions of Ottoman law on the subject. No Arab chief in Turkish Arabia or Mesopotamia is expected to hand over without question any person against whom proceedings are pending in the Ottoman tribunals (by which the judicial tribunals are presumably intended). In this connection I am under the impression that the papers regarding the Glanville murder at Basra in 1904 or 1905 will show that the local authorities at Basra admitted their inability to obtain the surrender of accused persons who had taken refuge with certain Arab tribes such as the Muntafik and Al-bu-Mahammad. 6. In support of the contention (paragraph 3 supra) regarding Arab _ and Mohammedan custom, it may be mentioned that no arrangements for extradition inter se exist between any Mohammedan principalities as far as my own knowledge goes, e.g., Jkluscat and Zanzibar, Muscat and Bahrein, Bahrein and Koweit, and Persia and Turkey (in practice). Each case is dealt with on its merits as it arises, the laws of hospitality and sanctuary being jealously guarded. See Moirs Commentary on the Koran and Doughty. The Koranic law has, I believe, explicit provisions on the subject. [2950 k—7]AVe ourselves, if I remember right, do not extradite Muscat subjects from India ^ on principle, but I am not clear about this. , 7, There are some thousands of Persians, Bahreinis, and Trucial Coast Arabs in y Koweit, and every year Arabs from Najd and elsewhere visit Koweit. The extradition t ~ of persons coming under these categories, and of persons who are only colourably Turkish subjects would raise verj^ awkward questions. Having regard to the above, I venture with great deference to suggest— (1.) That any provision for extradition is unnecessary, Koweit being a Qaza and the sheikh a Qaimmao-am (or Wali ?). laga (2.) Alteruative m that any provision inserted should be— (a.) Reciprocal and mutual. (h.) That extradition from Koweit should apply only to hond fide Turkish subjects and vice versa. (c.) Who are accused of grave criminal offences, justiciable by the highest Ottoman judicial tribunals. (d.) That the demand for extradition should come in every case direct from the Porte and not from irresponsible local officials. (e.) That the obligation be qualified by the words, ' 4 so far'as in him lies the sheikh ' (3.) A lternatively , ^that a clause be drafted providing that^deserters and malcon tents from Turkey shall not be received, and shall be expelled if found in Koweit territory.' 1 • A. T. W.

THE German press has followed with interest, bordering upon suspicion, the reported course of the negotiations between His Majesty's Government and the Turkish Government in regard to the Bagdad Railway and other questions. An article appeared recently over the signature of Dr. Paul Rohrbach which contained various statements alleged to have been derived from a Turkish source in regard to the negotiations. According to this article the convention negotiated by Hakki Pasha contained, besides the provisions already published relative to Koweit, the Bagdad Railway, &amp;c., the following concessions made by Great Britain : — 1. England agrees to guarantee to Turkey for forty years the integrity of her present territory. 2. England agrees to afford diplomatic support to the Turkish Government in the peace negotiations, and at once to bring pressure to bear on the allies with a view to hastening the conclusion of peace. 3. England agrees to assist in the financial liquidation of the war. 4. England agrees to render similar assistance in the regulation of the question of the possession of the islands on the coast of Asia Minor. 5. In the event of a declaration of complete independence on the part of Albania, England agrees to support the nomination of a Mohammedan ruler, but otherwise to favour the principle of Ottoman suzerainty over Albania. On her part Turkey is alleged to undertake :— 1. In the Bagdad question, to aim at the greatest possible advantages for England, especially as regards the section Bagdad-Ba.sra. 2. To grant special privileges to British subjects in Southern Arabia where British economic interests exist. • 3. To introduce without delay the necessary reforms in Armenia, Kurdistan, Syria, and Mesopotamia. 4. To leave to England a completely free hand in the Sultanate of Koweit. 5. To settle the pending frontier disputes with Persia in favour of the latter country. 6. To meet the wishes of the Arabian tribes in regard to autonomy. In commenting on this article the ' Frankfurter Zeitung said, in a recent issue, that if the statements contained therein w^re true the agreement was more far-reaching and of greater significance for the future ot lurkey than had hitherto been supposed, implying, as Dr. Rohrbach asserted that it did, the abandonment by Turkey J ^ J) (J ^ A ■«-». * X-v « '4- 1-* yv '*-» /'\ /'*• 1 T1 / ^ t 1*1 t' 1 i peninsula. of her position in Arabia, and the recognition of a British protectorate over the The ' Frankfurter Zeitung' went on to observe that it was a matter ot great importance, both for the integrity of Turkey and especially for German interests, to know how far England aimed at playing the role of first, or perhaps sole, adviser in the administrative reform of Asia Minor. On this would depend whether Germany could declare her concurrence in such an English ' mortgage on Arabia, and whether the whole Anglo-Turkish convention was compatible or not with an Anglo-German understanding. . • The ' Frankfurter Zeitung' was careful to point out that the assertions ot Dr. Rohrbach were entirely uncorroborated, and in a later issue it states that it had ascertained that they were incorrect in various important particulars, especially in regard to the alleged abandonment by Turkey of Arabia, and the alleged promise of support on the part of England in the question of the iEgean islands. On the other hand, it says that amongst the points of the convention enumerated, such an important matter as the cession of Cyprus to England, which was an accomplished fact, had been omitted.

Mallet to llakki Pasha. SIR L. MALLET presents his compliments to Hakki Pasha, and, with reference to article 7 of the draft convention respecting Koweit, &amp;c,, has the honour to inform his Highness that the well of Al Haba (about 24 kilom. distant from Al Garaa) should have been indicated as amongst those left to Koweit. Al Haba well is almost certainly within the green line on the map (annex No. 5), but to preclude all misunderstanding on the subject it seems advisable to include this place amongst those enumerated in article 7. A copy of the map is enclosed. Foreign Office, July 2, 1913. [2985 6—1J[This Document is the Property of His Britannic* Majesty s Government.] ^ r [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [July 3.] CONFIDENTIAL. S ection 5. [31234] No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Sir E. Goschen. (No. 220.) Sir, Foreign Office, Jidy 3, 1913. I TOLD the German Ambassador to-day that there was no question of onr signing the convention with Turkey this week or next week, but that w T e could not promise to delay signing them till an arrangement with Germany w^as completed. We must take the opportunity of signing when the Turks were ready. But, in any case, we would not publish them, and would keep them secret, till an arrangement with Germany had been concluded. This, it seemed to me, would avoid German susceptibilities about the navigation in the region of the Persian Gulf being aroused, as far as German public opinion was concerned, before the German Government could announce that they had made an arrangement with us. As a matter of fact, the Turks could not carry out the arrangement about the Bagdad Railway with us until they had come to an agreement with Germany. The Ambassador said that he would let me ha\re, as soon as possible, the observa tions of the German Government about the proposed arrangement with us. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY.
