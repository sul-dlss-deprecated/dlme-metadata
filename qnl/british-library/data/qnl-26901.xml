The Sultan of Ivluscat was invested by The King with the insignia of an honorary K. C.I.S. on March 30th. A It is customary in the case of Sheikhs in the A Persian Gulf and of certain notabilities in Nepal to exempt them fron signing the usual covenant for the restoration of insignia of Indian Orders; but it is understood that the father of the present Sultan of Muscat, when he received the K. C.I.S. in 1926, djd sign the undertaking. I do not think, however, that this is an adequate reason why we should not now, in accordance with more recent practice, exempt the Sultan from signing the covenant, especially since the Sheikh of Bahrein was so exempted when he received the K.C.I.E. in 1935 (see submission at P.Y.1699/35 flagged in file attached). It is therefore submitted that His Highness should be exempted from signing the covenant for the restoration of his K.C.I.E. insignia. The cost of the insignia is about £52 which in the event of the undertaking being waived would be borne by Indian revenues. It seems unnecessary, however, to consult the Government of I n dia on the question. Secretary. Political (Int.) Dent ., Secretary. Finance Department. f I » ! ” * WECiAL HiNmuGi Do you concur?

Lord Zetland has been considering the possibility of conferring an honour upon the Sultan on the occasion of his visit to England. The Sultan has now been ruling for nearly six years, and the Viceroy considers that it would be both appropriate and politic if an honour, which he recommends should be an honorary K.C.I.E., could be conferred upon His Highness. Lord Zetland agrees with the Viceroy and, if The King approves, would propose to sound the Sultan when he receives him here on the morning of the 29th March.

Your telegram about a K.C.I.E. for the Sultan of Muscat crossed my letter to you of 3rd December, as you will see, we are entirely in accord. The Sultan has behaved well about the extension of nib Treaty for a j-iirthei y-o.x, and from what I saw of him while he was in Delhi (though I do not exclude the possibility of dixficulty arising out of the details of the new Treaty) I think that on the whole the case for a K.C.I.S., if conditions seem to render that appropriate when he reache horr-e next March, is a good one. I need not say that I wholly agree with you as to the undesirability of taking soundings of him at this early stage. Lord Zetland dated 16th December 1937. lH- mLThis is much on the lines of the p. and p. telegram of 10th December. It will probably be best (unless there should then seem any strong reason to the contrary N to sound the Sultan on his arrival here, so that the honour can be conferred during his audience, ue may be going to Rome after leaving this country. The Palace have told us that, so far as they can foresee, the King would be able to receive the Sultan in the third week of March. (The latest information of the Sultan’s programme shows that he will not arrive till the 28th March. The paper is being referred to you with a view to the Palace being I informed of this change of date.) The Sultan will be the guest of H.M.G. for a fortnight. The Sultan’s presence in England and his entertainment here will very likely provide a good opportunity for making some progress with treaty negotiations, if we have with him a political officer competent to conduct them. It would be a good idea if oir i. Fowle himself could be sent on short deputation for this purpose. He discussed the point with us, and we/4 ^ U. \o we are making a suggeetTorr^n thcffg lines to the of I. Possibly, in replying to this letter, the b. of 3. might be disposed to refer to this point.3 Viceroy about the conferment of an Honorary K.C.I.E. on the Sultan of Muscat crossed my telegram of the 10th December. I am very glad to hear that you formed so good an opinion of the Sultan as a result of your personal contact with him y and your favourable impressions have dis posed of any hesitations I felt about the desirability of conferring the proposed Honouroupon him. As you will have seen from my telegram, I entirely agree with you that it is unnecessary to approach the Sultan so far ahead and I shall therefore await his arrival in Ehgland on March 28th before broaching the matter with him. If he welcomes the idea I have no doubt that we shall be able to arrange for him to be invested in person by the King. The Palace have agreed in principle that the Sultan should be received in audience by His Majesty but it is of course impossible to make any definite arrangement so far ahead.mam &amp; connection with the Sultan’s visit which I /f- LsUi t^A fa+M U should like to mention.

Confidential, 3rd December,1937. You will have seen a letter from Fowle to Metcalfe, No. C-337 of the 27th November, of which he sent a copy to the India Office at the time, in which he suggests that the case for con ferring ai honorary K.C.I.E. on the Sultan of Muscat is a strong one. 2. I was a good deal impressed by what I saw of the Sultan, and I think,too, that there is much to be said for the recognition which m honorary K.C.I.E. would constitute. He will not, I understand, be in England until the early spring of next year, and he is anxious then (I very much hope that it may be possible to arrange this) for an audience with His Majesty. So far as I am concerned I would like strongly to support Fowled suggestion. I am not entirely clear that it is necessary to take soundings so far ahead as he suggests or to adopt the indirect method which he contemplates in his letter. % own view is that2 it would be sufficient and appropriate that soundings should be taken by you, or by the India Office, on the Sultan’s arrival in London and before he has an audience with the King, and if, as I imagine will almost certainly be the case, it is confirmed that he would appreciate an honour of that character it could then be conferred on him during his audience, no previous public reference to it being made. 3. The State is an important one, and the hulers of Bahrein and Koweit have already the K.C.I.E. and C.S.I. I do not think there can be any question but that a recognition of this order would be appropriate and politic in the case of the Sultan. I hope that you will share my view.

I have just received a telegram from the Viceroy recommending the conferment on the Sultan of Muscat of an honorary G.C.I.E* in the New Year's Honours List. You may remember that the Sultan received the K.C.I.E.on the occasion of his last visit to this country in 1938*. since then, the Sultan has shown extensive and willing co-operation with H.M.G. in the present war, and ,though strictly speaking a neutral, has granted unstinted facilities in his territory to H.M.Naval and Air Forces. Subject to Cabinet approval, we may shortly have to approach him for the lease of Masirah /islandIsland as a permanent R.A.F. base. The present occasion seems particularly appropriate for the conferment of such an honour, since the bicentenary of the Sultan's dynasty has, as you know, been celebrated this November, and the Sultan himself is visiting India in January. His ancestors have been the recipients of both the G.C.I.E. and the G.C.S.I., and it is considered that the Sultan would appreciate the bestowal of.the G.C.I.E. I regret that this reccmmendation - a n/ ^ 1. has been made with so little time to spare. Both the Viceroy and myself, however, attach importance to it, and I should accordingly be grateful if you would lay it before His Majesty. , If the proposal is approved, an /appropriateappropriate occasion for the presentation of the Insignia would be when the Sultan visits Delhi early in January. ,nod L 5. AfeSERYiThis proposal seems to have a great deal to recommend it and I hope that it will be possible to overcome the formal difficulties* !v«y impression is that honorary awards are certainly made at the New Year and Birthday, but that they are not gazetted in the same way as other awards* This may, in fact, make it easier to overcome the difficulty arising from the lateness of the recommendation, since I think the chief reason why the recommendations have to be sent in early is to enable the gazette to be printed in plenty of time* Sir Harry Stockley will, however, be able to advise on this point. The Sultan was awarded the K.C.I.E. on the occasion of his visit to this country in 193b (file is attached}* I understand that the Sultan of Zanzibar already has the G.C.M.G. and that it is not proposed to give him an:INWARD TELEGRAM SECRET 566 Allotted to Private S ecretary; Cg ipy to Sir D-Monteath Gj&gt;pher Telegram (0« T« P.) from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India* dated New Delhi? 15.45 hours. 17th December? 1944-.
