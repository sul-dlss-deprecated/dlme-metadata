The telegram was sent in response to the ratification of the Republic of Ireland Act of 1948, which formally announced Ireland’s status as a republic, and the end of the constitutional rule of the British monarchy in the state. The telegram sets out the British Government’s position on the Act, prior to its coming into force in 1949.The telegram states:the expected relations that will exist between Great Britain and Ireland;that Britain will not regard Ireland as a ‘foreign country’ and its citizens not as foreigners;Ireland’s position in relation to the Commonwealth;how British officials might address the claims of other countries which have treaties with Britain containing ‘most-favoured-nation clauses’, and the arguments that Britain will use to resist such claims.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Ireland</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Republic of Ireland Act (1948)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Republicanism</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000023#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
