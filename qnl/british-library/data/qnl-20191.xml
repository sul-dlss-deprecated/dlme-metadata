At first sight, it aight appear to those unacquainted with the actual working of Land Settlement that a reference to the law prohibiting foreigners froa possessing land in Iraq would be a gratuitous invitation to the Iraqi Uovermsent to be obstructive. 1 was advised, however, that, in prM%iom§ oj &gt;j (&gt;osing lawyers often fall bask apon this law ss their last line of defence and that the Tat&gt;u department are bound to take note of their observations.

I had, as a matter of fact, already satisfied ays«lf that this view wa« wrong, but it was obviously advisable, in the circuitanoes, to tie the Iraqi levwwnt down to chapter and verse so as to shew that, far from deiaanding the impossible of the Irmql oov^nvient, I was merely asking thoia to apply the dociaions of their own Courts and the rulings of the relevant Minietries.

Q Ulth reference to ray despatch Ko. 35Q of July ir »th last, I have the honour to tranomlt to you lierewitli a trans lation of the reply from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to my note Ko. 347 of July 8th last, concerning the properties ^j in Iraq, belonging to the Bhalkhs of Koweit and ^lohaiamerah* f J ^ 2. You will have seen from my telegram Ko. 177 of July 14th that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was at first inclined to insist that a prior condition of the submission of the new proposals of His Majesty's Goveminent to the Council of I'inisters should be the acceptance by the Bhaikh of the arrangements suggested to him last year by the Political Kesidant in the Persian Gulf, whereby he could make &amp; positive contribution to wards the efforts of the Ira&lt;ii (Government to cojabat the smuggling of goods emanating from Koweit. lie ^as supported in this view by the Prime Minister and I roceived a note to this effect on July 16th. S. The sa.ae evening, however, during a private and friendly talk at my house, I wee able to convince Hurl &gt;aid that the smuggling proposals put forward by Kie -^jesty 's ^ovemiaent last year need not be regarded ae divinely inspired and that, as the Shaikh had flatly refused to consider them, it would per haps be asking too much to expect him to ovrallow then whole now. I s ^iggested that the Immediate purpose of the Iraqi ^overniaent would be served if the note ^vore more elastically worded and the Shaikh left a certain latitude in regard to the extent of his co-operation with the Iraqi Government, I said that an un fortunate Impression would be created in London and India if the terms of the note which I had just received became known. /Finally, The Kight Honourable Anthony den, i4.0. , U#r : ., etc. , etc* , etc. iFinally, Hurl Bald oonsented to take his note back and reword It In accordance with ay eu^geetlons, even thouijh it might en- tall the Prime Minister'8 diepleaeure. 4* He hae now done so, and I trust that the position will 'be viewed in a similarly accoiamodatinH spirit by the Shaikh himaelf# Should he continue in his 'non-possumus ' attitude, I fear that no progress will be made. It seems to be the definite policy of the responsible Iraqi liinisters to refuse to go out of their way to accommodate the Shaikh so long as he refuses to assist in a matter which 9 in their view, is one of Importance. 5* In previous correspondence on the smuggling aspect of this matter, the point has b «en stressed that the respons~ ibility for putting a stop to smuggling rests exclusively with the Iracxi Uovermaent; and this view might conceivably be put forward in support of further representations to the Iraqi Government designed to persuade them to treat separately the date gardens proposals of His Majesty 's Oovemiaent. 6. On the other hand, the 'Interesting cargoes'' case in the United states of America last year, and the recent efforts of His Majesty 1 s Government to protect North China against Japanese smuggling have not passed unnoticed in Iraq» There is an inclination to discern soiae inconsistency between the action which His Majesty's Government have taken in these cases and tiie arguiuent mentioned in paragraph 5 above* 7.

But I know why the Mudir had done so; it was Just to threaten. Today the Agent came to me and informed me of further activities of the Mudir: he (the Mudir) hinted to the ,, Taabah , • farmers to revolt and give provocation# For example, as I have already informed you, I ordered the palms in Ibn Jubai^s garden to be out down so as to build houses in their place. They were actually cut down two months ago, and nobody then said a word# The Mudir now directs them to prevent rocks being landed in the said garden claiming that they are landlords and asking us to prove our ownership to this land. Sir, the Mudir is not keeping at any limit, but I should like to take him with ease and policy in the beginning, although nothing will aveil with him.

The most he would consent to do was to suggest that the rights of the Iraqi Government should be similarly protected in their reply.

I now enclose a copy of a letter from Rendel on the subject, dated 7th September, and a copy of a note by Fowle. You will see that he does not think it worth following up the tentative soggestion that a lawyer might be found in Iraq. If you agree, we presume you will now instruct de Gaury to approach the Sheikh with the suggestion, asking him at the same time whether he would be willing to oear part of the cost. It is, of course, desirable to gee him to do so (and he may of course wish to himself) if it is possible without exerting undue pressure. The word 'press' in the Foreign Office letter does not, I imagine, mean more than this. Lieut.-Jolonel ?.G. Loch, C .I.^. Yours sincerely, /IiP.Z. 6507/36. (E.5320/18/93) Foreign Office,S .W .I# 7th September,1936. Dear Walton, ^ in your letter No.P.Z.5481/36 of the 19th August to Sterndale Bennett you enquired our views on Fowled suggestion that His Majesty*s Government should brief a lawyer to prepare the Sheikh of Koweit's case and subsequently represent him vis-a-vis the Land settlement Officer. 2. We agree that the outlay involved would probably be a good investment and we understand from the Treasury that they take the same view, vYhilst the actual briefing of the lawyer must clearly await the Iraqi Government's formal acceptance of our settlement proposals, the first step appears to be to get the Sheikh^ concurrence and, as you suggest, to press him to bear part of the cost. 3. In writing to Loch you may think it worth while to enquire whether he can suggest any non-Iraqi lawyer in Iraq or Koweit who would be suitable. We realise that it would be probably unwise to rely on the impartiality of a lawyer of Iraqi nationality, but if a local man of some other nationality could be found he would appear J .C. tfalton i£sq.,CB. ,MC., ' t0 /to have an advantage over an Egyptian in knowing the local conditions and the intricacies of the Iraq Land Law. 4 # I am sending a copy of this letter to Y/ardley at the Treasury, Yours sincerely, (Sd.) G.W.Rendel.Mr.Clauson . With regard to the lawyer who is to assist the Sheikh. I do not think that it is worth while pursuing Mr.Renders suggestion in para.3 of his letter of 7th September.(P.Z.6507). There are no lawyers in Kuwait, and those in Iraq are practically all Iraqi, or hand in glove with the Iraqis. 1 am strongly in favour therefore of briefing a really good man, when the time comes, from Egypt. Knowing Arabic he would be able to make himself familiar with the Iraqi Land Law etc. without much difficulty. 2, vVith regard to para.2 of Mr.Rendel's letter: that the Sheikh should be pressed to bear part of the cost. The necessity for having a lawyer at all has arisen from His Majesty's Government's provision ol 1914,and I do not see personally that there is any call on the Sheikh to pay any of the cost. This being so, 1 do not think we can press him very hard, but the proposition in the first instance at all events might be put to Jiim, and see how he reacts.(I note that I.O. 'letter of 19th August merely said 'whether he(the Shaikh) would be willing to bear the cost'. Nothing about pressing!

(E 6326/18/93) Sir, , /r6.AZ. jfrfpb i u h ^ ,' I Under cover of my despatch No.248 of tb«^4th Jun« I transmitted to you a copy of my despatch No. 359 of the 2nd June, to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad, in which were set out and explained the new arrangements which His Majesty's Government are proposing in the hope of finally liquidating all questions outstanding in connexion with tho datn gardens in Iraq 'belonging to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah. 2. You will recollect that in the last paragraph of that despatch it was explained that your telegram No.144 of the 27th May, reporting the death of Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah at Tehran on th^ 25th May, had been received after the despatch had been drafted, and that the question of the obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the heirs of the late Sheikh would now have to be examined. It was added that there appeared, however&gt; to be no reason meanwhile to defer or modify the approach to the Iraqi Government on behalf of both Sheikhs on the lines laid down in the preceding paragraphs of the despatch. 3./ N .M .Butler iisqG.'V .0 . , etc., etc., etc., Tehran.J7) 3. After considerable further correspondence between Kis Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the interested Departments of His Majesty's Government on points of detail and procedure, the new proposals of His Majesty's Government were formally communicated to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs in a note /rom His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires of the 8th July, a copy of which is enclosed herein for your information. You will observe that in paragraph 13 of that note it was suggested that the land settlement procedure should be applied first to the properties of the Sheikh of Koweit, and that the estates belonging to the late Sheikh of Mohammerah should be dealt with subsequently. I concurred in this modification being made in the original proposals, as set j)- 11 &gt; •'''? out in paragraph 16 of my despatch No.359 to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad, in view of the following considerations (a) The British personnel available for carrying out land settlement in Iraq is now reduced to only two officers, thereby making more difficult their special attachment for work in connexion with the Sheikhs' properties. (b) It appears that (contrary to the suggestion in paragraph 5 of my despatch No .'359 to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr) the main properties of the Sheikh of Koweit are distant some 12 to 20 miles from those belonging to the family of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, which would preclude their being included in the same settlement operation. (o)/ f(c) The need for land settlement is urgent in the case of the Koweiti estates, in view of the attempts which are 'being made in the Iraqi Courts to upset the Sheikh's title. On the other hand there has hitherto been little or no trouble as regards the ov/nership of the Mohammerah estates. (See paragraph 5 of my , despatch to Sir Archibald CD.ark Kerr No. 359). (d) The death of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the uncertainty regarding his succession has introduced a confusing element into the situation, which, it appears, might greatly complicate the task of land settlement. 4. No definite reply has hitherto been received from the Iraqi Government to the note of the 8th July from His Majesty's Embassy. The Iraqi Prime Minister, after an attempt to link up a settlement in regard to the Sheikhs' properties with the grievances of the Iraqi Government on account of smuggling from Koweiti territory, finally assured His Majesty's Charge' d'Affaires that he would be ready to give independent consideration to the proposals of His Majesty's Government and to lay them before the Council of Ministers on their own merits. Although the proposals are still being considered by the Iraqi Government, Mr. Bateman was hopeful that their consent would be forthcoming in time for the preliminary survey (of the properties to be subjected to land settlement) to be put in hand this autumn. It is clear, however, that a considerable period must elapse before the preliminary survey/6./ 5 V survey and the actual land settlement operation can 'be completed in respect of the Sheikh of Koweit's estates. In viev/, therefore, of the decision not to press for the concurrent treatment of 'both sets of properties, many months are likely to pass before there can be any question of the estates of the Mohammerah family coming under land settlement. 5. At the same time, as explained in paragraph 5 of my despat d . 359 to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, His Majesty's Government are aiming as far as possible at a comprehensive settlement of the outstanding points connected with the properties of both Sheikhly families, and without prejudice to the eventual decision which may be taken as to the application of land settlement to the estates of the late Sheikh of Mohammerah, they hope that it will be possible to induce the Iraqi Government to dispose of the taxation aspect in regard to both sets of properties on the lines proposed in paragraph 6 of the notie addressed by Mr. Bateman to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the instructions in my despatch No.359. Apart from the eventual possibility of a claim arising against His Majesty's Government in respect of land alienated from the estates of the late Sheikh of Mohammerah in the course 9f land settlement (see paragraph 8 of my | H Jl despatch to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr No. 359), the question may, therefore, arise before very long of the compensation due from His Majesty's Government (in accordance with the pledge given to the late Sheikh in 1914) in respect of indirect taxation levied by the Iraqi Government since the introduction of the Istihlak tax in 1932 on produce from the estates belonging to Sheikh Khasal in Iraq,53 6, Before the question of compensation con 'be considered it is clearly necessary to decide the extent to which the assurance given to the late Sheikh of Mohammerah in 1914 regarding his lands in Iraq may 'be held to 'be binding in respect of his heirs, in view of the fact that the Sheikhs of Mohammerah no longer possess any autonomous status. Preliminary consideration of this problem has, however, convinced me that further information is necessary in the first place concerning the heirs themselves and the arrangements which are likely to ensue for the future ownership of the properties in Iraq. ?. I shall be glad therefore to receive any information which you can furnish as regards the heirs 'to the property of the late Sheikh, and generally as regards the probable arrangements for succession to the lands in the possession of Sheikh Khazal at the time of his death: The division between the heirs of the Iraqi estates belonging to the late Sheikh would presumably be a matter for the Iraqi Courts and in accordance with the Shari' Law, but 1 shall be glad to learn whether any information is available on this point. Further, while His Majesty's Government have not so far decided whether it would be wise or practicable to discriminate between Sheikh Khazal's heirs in the allocation of any compensation, I shall be glad to learn your opinion as to the relative merits of the various heirs, judged by their behaviour towards the late Sheikh. 8. Another point upon which I should welcome your observations is the probable attitude of the Persian Government towards such of the heirs as ar^ still resident in Persia. Are they likely to be allowed to receive undisturbed - as I believe Sheikh Khazal was allowed to do - the/sV ASN the revenues from the family properties in Iraq, and in particular any sum v/hich might be allotted to them by His Majesty's Government as compensation under the 1914 pledge? The fact that certain of the heirs are apparently seeking to acquire Iraqi nationality suggests the possibility of the formation of antagonistic Persian and Iraqi cliques among the heirs. This might result in discrimination against the Persian heirs in the Iraqi Courts when the division of the estates comes up for decision (e.g. the provision of Iraqi law forbidding foreigners to hold land in Iraq might be invoked), and I shall be interested to learn whether you consider that in such an event the Persian Government would be likely to give diplomatic support to the cause of the heirs who remained Persian subjects. 9. A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad under cover of a despatch (of which I enclose a copy) making complementary enquiries on the same subject. I am, with great truth, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) j If —7~7—n c ION oFPioe iS 70 Q ^ / i_ O p PORLIGN OPPICili, No. 659 7th October, 1936. (E 6326/18/93) Sir, With reference to my despatch No* 359 of the 3l 2nd June, I transmit to Your Excellency herev/ith a copy of T*u\ a despatch to His Majesty's Charge d Affaires at Tehran regarding the position of the heirs of the late Sheikh \ Khazal of Mohammerah in connexion with the new proposals of His Majesty's Government for a comprehensive settlement of outstanding questions concerning the properties in Iraq of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah. 2. You will observe from paragraphs 6 - 8 of t^ie enclosed despatch to Mr. Butler that 1 am anxious to ' obtain as much information as possible in regard to Sheikh Khazal's heirs and the general question of the succession to his former properties. I shall be grateful for any observations which you may have to offer on the various points raised in those paragraphs. It may in fact prove easier to obtain accurate information in Iraq as to the succession to the Mohammerah estates, since it appears that the control of at least the Iraqi estates of the family is vested in the late Sheikh Khazal's agent at Basra. 1/ His Excellency Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, K.C.M.G,, etc., etc., etc.j Bagdad.I prefer, however, to leave it to your discretion whether or not to instruct His Majesty's Consul at Basra to make any enquiries from Khan Bahadur Mirza Muhammad, in view of the risk that such enquiries might give the agent the impression that His Majesty's Government had already decided to pay compensation to the heirs. 3. I shall, in particular, be glad to receive any information which Your Excellency can furnish regarding the probable procedure in the Iraqi courts for the settlement of the succession to the Iraqi properties of Sheikh Khazal. I should be interested also to learn whether the adoption of Iraqi nationality by some of the heirs would strengthen their claims as against the heirs who remained Persian subjects; fo instance, could the technical prohibition of the ownership of land in Iraq by a foreigner be used for the purpose of excluding the Persian heir^ from the succession? 4. Finally, I shall be glad to learn whether you consider that there is any risk of advantage being taken of disputes amongst the heirs by outside elements to put in claims to the ownership of any of the lands in question. It has hitherto been assumed that the title of the late Sheikh to his properties in Iraq was fully secured. In the event, however, of a risk of outside claims to these estates materialising it would seem desirable to hasten as far as possible the application of the land settlement procedure to the Mohammerah properties. On the other hand, as pointed out in the letter from the Chancery of His Majesty s Embassy to the Eastern Department Wo. 107/40/36 of the 2nd July, it would certainly appear difficult for the land/land settlement procedure to be carried out before the riva claims of the various heirs have been settled in accordance with Iraqi law.

I enclose for your information a copy of a n6te hy Colonel Fowle on these two points# 3. Colonel Powle's provisional view about the first point (i.e. that regarding 'barren land') appears to amount roughly to this: if part of the land which was in the Sheikh*s possession in 1914 is declared to be mowat or 'miri sirf and confiscated by the State, then it is fair that the Sheikh should be compensated, if the land has any value, according to what would be likely to be its market price. This seems to be reasonable and we are inclined to agree with Powle. We are also.inclined to agree with him D.J.Scott Pox Esq., Foreign Office. * that/ / /p 2. that it is unnecessary to say anything to the Sheikh at this stage, but that His Majesty's Government might make up their own minds on the subject. We should accordingly be glad to know whether you agree with the view stated above. 4. As regards the second point, we agree with Powle that if the Sheikh is confirmed by the Land Settlement Officers in the possession of land additional to that which was possessed in 1914, it would not in any way affect His Majesty's Government's obligations to him in regard to the 1914 pledge or enable them to evade responsibility for compensating him in respect of land possessed in 1914 of which the Land Settlement procedure deprives him. Would you kindly confirm that you agree with this view? 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Hale.

We agree with Hale^ first amendment but would prefer that the specific question raised in his suggested additional sentence should not be mentioned to Bagdad until it has been the subject of further investigation. So far as we are aware, it has not hitherto occurred to anybody to define the land covered by the 1914 pledge otherwise than as the whole area of land actually in the Sheikh*s possession at that date, and as a first step we propose to ask Powle for his views on the possible alternative interpretation now suggested.

Yhen, for instance, an * Iraqi wishes to buy a property on which palms are grown the term NAKHIL is used to cover the whole estate though only part of it may be planted ^rith date trees. (In point of fact besides date palms large quantities of vegetables are also grown in the so-called date gardens).

Dated 30th December, 1936. BU cowfIoent al records Sir Arnold Wilson came to see me this afternoon with regard to the claim of the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. He asked me what the present position was. I explained 'briefly to him the situation today. I told him of the plan which is in the minds of the Foreign Office, namely, that we should obtain an agreement from the Iraqi Government that no arrears of the direct taxation payable before 1932 should be demanded of the Sheikh and that no discriminatory taxation should be levied against him by the Iraqi Government. Having obtained this assurance, we hoped to have a basis on which we could calculate the composition of the compensation due to the heirs of the Sheikh. We still maintained that the Iraqi Government should pay this, but, if they did not, we recognised that an obligation lay upon His Majesty^ Goveinment. I explained to him further that the position was complicated by the fact that there was another similar case, that of the Sheikh of Koweit, and that in this particular instance there was a hitch owing to the fact that the title of this Sheikh to his land was being questioned by the Iraqi Government. Efforts were at present being made to reach a settlement on this particular point and, when this had been done, the way would be open for His Majesty's Government to deal with the two cases pari passu. There was a further temporary hitch, due to the fact that, though the Treasury had recognised the obligation as regards the Sheikh of Mohammerah himself, they had not yet recognised the obligation in respect of his heirs. Sir Arnold Wilson^ letter to me, however, had showed clearly that there were definite heirs, who had appointed an administrator OQPY SENT — to /2 - , / to act for them, and this should go far to convince the Treasury of the desirability of recognising their claim also. We were in communication with the Treasury on this particular point at the present time. In conclusion, I told Sir Arnold Wilson that I had been absolutely frank with him as to the facts. I hoped, however, that he would use the utmost discretion in passing them on to anybody else# He would recognise that, if the Iraqi Government came to know that we recognised the obligations towards the two Sheikhs, they would refuse at once and finally to pay another penny. Moreover, I thought it undesirable that the cases of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and of the Sheikh of Koweit should be linked together until the negotiations with regard to the title deeds of the land of the latter had been brought to a successful conclusion. Sir Arnold said he fully recognised this and he did not Intend to pass on a single word of what I had said to him to anybody. There was, however, a question he would like to ask me. Would the Foreign Office agree that the arbitrator should put the affairs of the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohanfrnerah into the hands of a reputable solicitor in London in order that the whole claim might be treated decently and in order? I told Sir Arnold Wilson I should like to consult the Department 1 concerned further on this point# Sir Arnold also asked me to write him a letter merely stating that the whole question was under active consideration by the Treasury and that, when we had further information, we would let him know. If this letter could be sent him in duplicate, he would forward a copy to the arbitrator, and he would then have to tell him nothing more. I told Sir Arnold that I would do this. (Intlld. ) C.

BRITISH EMBASSY, BAGDAD. 31st December, 1936. &gt;&lt;10— r My dear George, ' Please see your despatches Nos.776 of DecemlDer 2nd (E 7307/18/93) and 822 of December 17th (E 7715/18/93) about the properties of the Shaikh of Koweit• ■ ^ R 1. As regards the latter, the correspondence 'between the Treasury and India Office, which was enclosed in India Office letter to Fowle of December 10th was not sent to us. Consequently, we are ignorant of Hale's new proj^osal. V/ill you be very kind and let us have the necessary copies of the correspondence? I 2. As regards the former, I think you are wise not to bind yourself to any particular course of action concerning 'mowat' land until, at least, the results of the application of Land Settlement procedure are known. Personally, I do not expect much difficulty if, as I hope, I am able to get the Iraqi Government eventually to agree that the special Court of Appeal under the Land Settlement Law shall be that presided over by Lloyd at Basra. This proposal v/as made, as you no doubt remember, in our note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of July 8th last. If the government remain in their present mood, I may even persuade them to allow Lloyd to apply English principles of equity in doubtful cases. In that event, it ought to be fairly plain sailing. 3. But I feel I ought to warn you not to expect things to move too quickly. There were so many abuses under the Land/ G. V/. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G I2 Land Settlement Law that the government are considering the introduction of radical changes in it. I have seen some of the proposals put forward. They seem reasonable and, so far as I can judge, are not likely to react against the Shaikhs. 4. One piece of hopeful news gleaned hy Bateman during a recent visit to Basra was that Abdullah Zuhair, who claimed portions of the Paddaghlyah garden, has just died. This means that the cases pending against the Shaikh of Koweit will have to be brought de novo and the whole cause XV V'/ V* ^ -A. &lt; pleaded afresh. Fortunately for us, the claimant's son lirTlunatic and we shall thus have a breathing space, during which I shall urge the government to accede to our Land Settlement proposals without delay. Once they accede, we can, I think, forget the pending cases, as they will fall to be dealt with by the Land Settlement Officer (again please see our note No.34^ to the Ministry of orelgn Affairs of July 8th, paragraph 9). ' 5. Reverting, however, to your despatch No.776, I think I ought to point out that there are one or two points in it that show that your information is inexact. 6. In paragraph 3 the phrase in 'brackets conveys a wrong impression. The fact is that the Iraqi Government have not taken the piece of land in question. T-e only land the Shaikh has ever lost was the 'bit of the Bashiyah which, as you know, he lost through his own action in rushing into i ■n minwii u . n i m n wpwiwiijiin mwn court without telling us. The history of the piece of land v/hich Ward wanted for a labour camp at Pao is very simple. Ward went to great trouble two years ago, in looking round for a site, to make sure that he would not 'be treading on the Shaikh's toes. As an Iraqi employe he could not very well ask the Shaikh directly or through his agent whether the land was his. But he made exhaustive enquiries in all other/3 - other directions and reached the conclusion that the land was miri . As soon as he heard that it was claimed 'by the Shaikh, he (as he says called his dogs off and I persuaded the government to do nothing ahout it» In the summer, however, after having ascertained from the Shaikh personally that he would he willing to hand over his useless hit of swamp to Ward, I asked the government whether they would accept it on the distinct understanding that it was to he regarded as a gift without prejudice to the Shaikh 1 s claim to ownership. They declined, because they were not anxious to he 'beholden to one who, at that moment, was regarded as a thorn in their flesh. There the matter rests. The land is untouched. The Shaikh still has it and Colonel Ward is looking round ^or another site to make the lot of his Arab labourers healthier and happier. 7. The site value idea originated with Powle, hut I think that a moment's reflection will prove to you that there is nothing in it. Of v /hat use would sites he plumb in the middle of a privately owned date swamp with no right of way? Powle argued from the false assumption that the Iraqi Government had suddenly found some virtue in the hit that Colonel Ward had his eye on. But this is, as I have shown ahove, quite wrong. Ward only chose the spot because it was the nearest place to his Pao depot where (after a lot of filling in and rolling) he would be able to establish a decent place for his men to live in. Even then, it was over a mile from the depot (they live next door at present) and he chose it because he thought it was not the Shaikh's property. 8. There is also (if you can bear further with me) one other error into which you seem to have fallen. It is this. If I read paragraphs 6 and 7 of your despatch correctly, there is an idea that the exact boundaries of the/4, the properties covered by the 1914 pledges are ascertainable. My information is, however, that this will be difficult and probably impossible, it is even doubtful if the Shaikh himself knows exactly what his father was possessed of in 1914. Judge Alexander knows the shaikh T s properties well. He also knows the difficulties arising from our 1914 pledge. Her is a record of what he told Bateman in August last: 'It is a forlorn hope to refer to 'the 1914 boundaries as though they were existent or capable offroof, in Judge Alexanders opinion they are not and for this reason. It is the usual practice in these parts to plant date shoots on unoccupied land near creeks, etc., as soon as water becomes available. This has occurred on land reclaimed from the Shatt and where creeks have been cleared out. The judge knows for a fact that the Shaikh has done a lot of this in the recent past through ' taabin ', Taabin can operate either as tenants ( fellahin ) or co-partners. it all depends on what terms they receive their share of profit. No doubt the Shaikh will argue that all the taabin are his fellahin but he has treated them very badly and it is doubtful if he will get away with it in every case. But he probably will in some cases, and taking it by and large he will gain as much over and above his alleged 1914 limits as he may lose through successful taabin claims against him,' 9, It was for reasons such as this that, as soon as we were given the tip that Tusurruf over 10 - 15 years would be the guiding criterion for the Land Settlement Officer to adopt, we jumped at the Land Settlement proposals. The Shaikh, given ordinary luck, ought to get away with more than he is properly entitled to and certainly more than was covered by the pledge given to his father in 1914, in these circumstances it seems to me that he certainly would be beholden to us, especially as, in the ordinary course. Land Settlement procedure would not /not (without our intervention) have been applied in the Basra district in his lifetime, 10. I think it well to make the point that the longer a settlement is delayed, the more difficult it will be to establish the 1914 boundaries. Much will depend on the oral evidence of the taabin . Many of those living in 1914 are now dead and, as the legality of some of the deeds is questioned, it would be inadvisable to rely too much on them. 11. Please forgive this long letter. 1 have written it because I am anxious to dispel any misapprehension that may some day lead to disappointment. Yours ever, (Intld.)

You will see that the intervention of Sir Arnold U- V 37 Wilson on 'behalf of the heirs of the Sheikh of Mo hammer ah has brought to a head the question of future proc.edure in dealing with the question of compensation for tax losses. As this concerns the Sheikh of Koweit equally with the Sheikh of Mohammerah we shall be grateful to learn as soon as possible whether the India Office concur generally in our attitude and if so whether you agree with the terms of the relevant section of the draft reply to Sir Arnold Wilson, Yours sincerely, {Sgd.) J. G. Ward. M. J. Clauson, Esq. COPY SENT TO.\iL P. Z. 1843/37. (E. 1303/53/93). ^Smportant and Immediate. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. 18th March, 1937. tu. Dear Hale, Following on our telephone conversation yesterday I send you herewith a copy of Sir Arnold Wilson* s further letter to Lord Cranborne of the 28th February together with the draft reply which we suggest should be sent to him. The draft is not being submitted to higher authority here until we know whether you feel able to concur in it, 2. You will remember that the Sheikh of Mohammerah died when we were on the point of sending to Bagdad instructions for a new comprehensive settlement (Foreign • qO Office despatch to Bagdad NO. 359 of the 2nd June, 1936) and that we recorded in the last paragraph of that despatch that it would be necessary for His Majesty's Government to examine how far the assurances given to Sheikh Khazal in 1914 might be held binding in respect of his heirs. v n /e subsequently went into matters very fully here and as a result we arrived at the conclusion that the first step must be to obtain more information about the heirs and the various technical questions connected with the inheritance to the Iraqi properties. We accordingly made the necessary enquiries of Bagdad i U Q and Tehran in despatches of the 7th October (copies of which were sent to you under our number E 6326/18/93 on /l' c ^ the 9th October), We received replies to these despatches early this year (copies of which went to/ &amp; E. Hale, Esq,in to you under our number E 215 / 53/ 93 of the 29th January) and when Sir Arnold 7/ilson f s further letter reached the Eastern Department we had just finished reconsidering the whole matter and were about to approach you again on the subject. 3. The position now is that we must return an early reply to Sir Arnold Wilson, but that at the same time we feel that it is essential to tell him something definite about the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the heirs and also to give him some idea of the procedure which we contemplate in the future. The enclosed draft shows the conclusions which the eastern Department have provisionally reached in both these respects and you will see that we have at the same time included in the draft certain additional general 4. When we sent the despatches of enquiry to Bagdad and Tehran last October we were already under the impression that it would be extremely difficult to maintain that the otiigation assumed vis-a-vis the Sheikh of Mohammerah in respect of his Iraqi date gardens was not legally binding, in respect of his heirs, who are explicitly mentioned in the original promise. It has been suggested in the past that as the 1914 promise was made to the Sheikh when he was in a special and semi-independent feudal position in Persia it might be considered to lapse in respect of his heirs when that position was lost. This thesis seems to us very dubious, particularly in the light of correspondence between the Foreign Office and explanations. Sir/ti? .t ,11 Sir Percy Cox in 1927 which made it clear that the promise given in respect of Bheikh Khasal's Iraqi date gardens was considered at the time it was given to 'be an unconditional obligation, independent of the promises also made in respect of the Sheikh's position in Persia. At the same time we did feel that it might 'be extremely difficult, if not almost impossible, in practice to carry out the promise towards the Sheikh's heirs, and for this reason we withheld any definite conclusion until we had obtained more detailed information from Bagdad and Tehran. 5. The replies, and in particular the despatch from Bagdad, show in our view that the administrative difficulties which we originally anticipated in dealing with the heirs need not materialise, and that provided the family estates in Iraq are maintained as an entity in the form of a family trust under the administration of an authorised agent (at any rate until such time as we have effected a final settlement relieving us of our obligations) there should be no more difficulty in paying compensation, and if necessary, in defending the title to the properties against the Iraqi Government, than in the case of the estates of the Sheikh of Koweit. The replies have also convinced us that however desirable in theory, it would in practice be impossible to discriminate between the 29 heirs (male and female) on grounds of merit, and that there would, therefore, be no objection on this score to paying any compensation into a family trust. We feel, however, that we must make the maintenance of conditions ensuring that the estate can be dealt with as a whole through a single agent an absolute condition of payment of compensation, and that we/4. we should in no circomstances 'be drawn into dealing with individual heirs. When we have disposed of the reply to Sir Arnold Wilson, we propose therefore to take up the suggestion in paragraph 8 of Bagdad despatch No. 612 that the heirs should be informed that they must agree to a family trust if they expect to receive any compensation from His Majesty's Government. (The question of what our attitude would 'be if one or more of the heirs refused to come into a family trust and insisted on having his or their share of the property * made over individually had, I think, 'better be left until it arises, since it is not clear whether in such circumstances it would still be possible for the rest of the heirs to incorporate the remainder of the property in a trust), 6. As regards the question of future procedure, you will see that v/e have thought it necessary to mention in the draft to Sir Arnold Wilson that if the possibility of a comprehensive settlement covering both the , 'possession ,, and 'taxation' issues continues to be remote, we may be ready to pursue the question of tax losses independently, subject, however, to our obtaining the necessary assurances from the Iraqi Government not to collect the arrears of direct taxation and not to levy discriminatory taxation in the future. You will remember that we had some discussion on this point at the interdepartmental ^ jlx meeting on the 15th May, 1936 ( a copy of the final record of which went to you on the 10th June, 1936). I see from page 9 of the record that you then stated that the Treasury would be prepared to consider a separate settlement of the compensation aspect if necessary, and it looks as though/Ilo 5. though this may turn out to 'be the 'best course. It will presumalDly 'be cheaper not to wait longer than necessary, and there would, of course, be political value in settling the taxation side of the promise, particularly in view of q 1 Jr- the attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit (see Clausen's remarks - I- — on pages 7 and 3 of the same record). The present position is that we have instructed the Ambassador at Bagdad to urge our comprehensive proposals on the new Government (Foreign Office telegram No. 16 of the 15th January to Bagdad a copy of which went to you under our number E 7797/18/93). When we learn the reaction of the Iraqis we shall be in a position to decide whether or not to go ahead with the idea of an independent settlement for the taxation aspect, 7, We should be very grateful to learn as soon as possible whether you share our view about the attitude which His Majesty's Government should adopt towards the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and about future procedure and, if so, whether you agree in the terms of the draft letter to Sir Arnold Wilson ( who, as I have said, should be given a reply as soon as possible ). 8, The India Office are not directly interested in the question of the estates of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, but they are directly concerned in the question of future procedure, since it will obviously be necessary to treat the ^ ^ ttrtiiinriiniiir i'th'i - ifiii'iyu 'i 11 i... ja ^ Sheikh of Koweit and the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah on an exactly equal footing. I am therefore sending a copy of this letter to Clauson and asking him whether the India Office feel able to agree with the policy proposed. Yours sincerely, Sgd. J. G. Ward.P.2,1843/37 E. 1308/53/93 J.G.W. Rr r March, 7, 1937. Personal and confidential■ A^&gt; For Treasury India Office concurrence Sir .n. Wilson, M .P- In accordance with the promise in my letter (fpom Lord Cranborn^of i-^arch 3, I write to let you lenow the oresent position about the question of compensation for the loss of income from the date garaenj in Irag belonging to the late Sheikh of Mohammerah. arising from the incidence of the new Iraqi 'Istihlak' tax on agricultural produce. 2. You may remember that I told you during our conversation at the Foreign Office on the 3rd December that His Majesty's Government had alv/ays recognised the obligation incurred in respect of Sheikh Khazal's Iraqi properties as a result of the promise given to him in November 1914, but that the position had recently been complicated by the Sheikh's death. I explained that in the circumstances a formal decision was required by His Majesty's Government before the promise given to Sheikh Khazal could be considered in principle as holding good in respect of his heirs. 3. Since our interview we have gone carefully into the whole question in the light of further information which we have obtained about the Sheikh's heirs and the technicalities of the inheritance. As a result I am now able to inform you that His Majesty's Government have decided, in principle, that Sheikh Khazal's heirs shall be treated in respect of the date gardtns in Iraq no less favourably than the latie Sheikh himself, provided, however, that \A C ' k ff the heirs furnish the essential degree of co operation /t v 2. operation on their side by agreeing to the Iraqi properties being turned into some kind of a joint family trust under an administrator witn whom His Majesty's Cxovernment can deal direct. For obvious reasons it is essential that the Iraqi estates of the family shall not be partitioned. We could not possibly deal individually with the twenty-nine present heirs, male and female, let alone with their future heirs. Nor could v/e become involved with outside parties in the event of any of the heirs parting with their share or using it as security for borrowing money. 4. Now that we have recognized that the promise to Sheikh Khazal holds good in principle in respect of his heirs, we have to consider the extremely complicated question of future pro cedure. As you are doubtless aware, the promise to the Sheikh of Moharnmerah about his Iraqi estates followed immediately after a similar promise to the Sheikh of Koweit, who also possessed extensive properties in southern Iraq- The promises consist of a twofold assurance ci continued undisturbed possession and of future immunity from taxation. Unluckily no formal admission has ever been obtained from the Iraqi Government that they recognize that these obligations contracted by His Majesty's Govern ment have now devolved upon themselves. Nevertheless the promises were observed in practice up to 1932, since the taxes payable under the old Turkish system of direct taxation on/Illf 3. on landed property which prevailed up to that year were not in fact levied upon the properties of the two Sheikhs, although the Iraqi Government consistently claimed that by right theae taxes should he levied and that the question of payment was merely in suspense. In 1932, however, the introduction of the jjresent indirect 'Istihlak' tax on sales of agricultural produce in place of direct taxation made it impossible for the sheikhs' gardens on practical grounds alone to continue to receive exemption. At the same time it became clear that there v/ere also risks in regard to the fulfilment of that part of the 1914 promise which related to the guarantee of possession, since the Sheikh of Koweit was divested by the Iraqi Courts of one of his estates, and various other suits, which have only been suspended with great difficulty, were brought against him in respect of other estates. 5. We have always recognised in principle that if the Iraqi Government could not be forced to assume our obligations in the matter of exemption from taxation we should have to compensate the Sheikhs for their losses, preferably in the form of a lump sum payment equivalent to so many years of annual taxation. But it was clear from the first that the only practical policy was to arrange for the compensa tion in respect of taxation to form part of a final settlement of the whole question and to be linked with assurances from the Iraqi Government that they would guarantee the Sheikhs against dispossession in the future, as well as against attempts to claim taxation for the pre-1932 period (during which, as I have explained, they11 4. enjoyed de facto exemption) or discriminatory taxation in the future. Otherwise there would 'be a constant risk of fresh claims for compensa tion which would create a sort of running financial embarrassment to His Majesty's Govern ment. Moreover, if we were at this stage our selves to pay compensation direct to the heirs, we should greatly have weakened our thesis that the Iraqis have legally inherited the promises of 1914, which is at present our best lever for inducing them to co-operate in a final settle ment . 6- Accordingly after prolonged negotiations with the Iraqi Government we put before them last summer new and comprehensive proposals for a settlement of the whole problem of the date gardens. These included a scheme by which the Sheikhs would receive an unassailable legal title to their properties. They also in eluded (as I explained to you at our last meet ing) an undertaking from the Iraqi Government that no arrears of direct taxation payable before 1932 should be demanded of the Sheikhs and that no discriminatory taxation should be imposed on the estates in future. We had reached a stage where we had good ground for hoping that these proposals would be accepted, and the way cleared to a comprehensive settle ment of the whole problem, when the Government of Yasin Pasha was turned out of office. 7. V/e are now trying to get the new Govern ment to fall into line. But although a comprehensive settlement of both aspects of the promise would be greatly preferable in the interest5. interests of all concerned it is clear that this may not be forthcoming without further delay and we are now considering the e expedient of attempt ing to settle the taxation aspect separately and in advance of the possession aspect. But assurances from the Iraqi Government not to f claim arrears of taxation or levy discriminatory taxation in future are an essential condition even for this limiten objective. B. Y /e are now doing our best to extract these assurances from the Iraqi Government. When we have obtained them we shall come up against the very difficult ^ueotion of assessing the lass of revenue from the Sheikhs' Iraqi properties through the f■ ct that their produce has a slightly lower value owing to its having to pay the 10% 'Istihlak' tax when eventually sold in the market. '17e began to investigate this question in detail in 1935, and the oheikhs were asked, as a preliminary step to the consideration of ways and means of compensating them, to supply figures of the estimated losses from this tax. You will remember that in your letter to me of October 16th you enclosed copies of correspond ence on this very point between the Sheikh Khaaal' agent and the Embassy at Bagdad and I should perhaps mention (for your own information) that the claims submitted by the agent are considered by expert opinion to be far too high. For instance, the sales of dates from Sheikh Khazal's estates are given as amounting to more than the quantity sold from the estates of the Sheikh of Koweit, although the Sheikh of Koweit's estates are assessed by the Iraqi revenue authorities at double/double the bearing capacity. V/e shall therefore have to give very close and careful attention to the detailed financial aspect of the question before fixing the amount of any compensation. 9. In the meanwhile it is important that the heirs should themselves take steps to fulfil the essential condition v/hich I have mentioned above by retaining the family estates in Iraq as an entity under an administrator with whom we can deal on their behalf. 10- I have tried in this letter to explain the position as fully as possible and I hope that I may have convinced you that we are doing our best to dispose of a most complicated problem. I should x^erhaps emphasise the fact that the grievance of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to the 1914 promise only concerns the taxation aspect and even then only refers to the period after 1932 when the new indirect tax of 10fo was introduced. Por the whole period up to 1932 Sheikh Khazal's properties in Iraq paid no taxes and his right to possession has never been challenged- 11. I should be grateful if you would treat this letter as entirely confidential. At the same time I have no objection to your informing Sheikh Khazal's agent that in principle His Majesty's Government have decided that the heirs shall be treated collectively no less favourably than Sheikh Khasal himself would have been treated, and that their claim to compensation for tax losses has not been overlooked. At the same time it would be well to add that it is essential that the estates in Iraq shall not be partitioned/P.Z.1843/1937.

You may remember that I told you during our conversation at the Foreign Office on the 3rd December that His Majesty's Government had always recognised the obligation incurred in respect of Sheikh Khazal's Iraqi properties as a result of the promise given to him in November 1914, but that the position had recently been complicated by the Sheikh 's death, and that before a formal decision could be taken as to the recognition of the claims of the heirs, it would be necessary to obtain and consider the facts relating to the Sheikh's Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Arnold Wilson, K.C.I.2., C.S.I. ,'M.P.Sheikh's estate. As you kno\7, there are twenty-ei^'ht heirs, male and female, each of whom may in turn have numerous heirs, and you will therefore I am sure appreciate the need for careful consideration. 3. Since our interview we have gone carefully into the v/hole question in the light of further information which we have obtained about the Sheikh's heirs and the technicalities of the inheritancei As a result I am now able to inform you that His Majesty's Government have decided, in principle, that Sheikh Khazal's heirs shall be treated in respect of the date gardens in Irag no less favourably than the late Sheikh himself, provided, however, that the heirs furnish the essential degree of co-operation on their side by agreeing to the Iraqi properties being turned into some kind of a Joint family trust under an administrator with whom His Majesty's Government can deal direct. 4. Your letter of the 5th April suggests that the division of the Sheikh's estates in Iraq among the heirs is inevitable. The information available to us on the legal position suggests on the contrary that the question whether or not the estates are divided depends on the wishes of the heirs themselves, the provisions of Mohammedan law being apparently/apparently equally applicable to the division anions the heirs of the revenues from the estates as a whole? and to the actual division among the heirs- of the estates themselves.. It ap ears that the heirs would receive financially much more from their inheritance if they did not divide up the estates since in order to exploit them most profitably it is essential that they should 'be administered as an entity by a reliable agent empowered to arrange to best advantage the packing and sale of the date crop. This could apparently be done by making the estates into a 'waqf', which would in this case amount to a family trust. At the same tlie it appears that owing to jealousies among the heirs there is a grave risk that certain of them may press for partition. 5. You will I am sure realise why it is essential from the point of view of His Majesty's Government that the Iraqi estates of the family should not be partitioned. \&lt;e could not possibly deal individually with the twenty-eight present heirs, male and female, let alone with their future heirs. Nor could we become involved with outside parties in the ev-nt of any of the heirs, or their heirs, parting with their share or using it as security for borrowing money. 6./* 36 5.

If so, please telegraph an estimate (which need be approximate only for immediate purposes) of the average annual loss of Revenue sustained by Sheikh since imposition of Istihlak Tax up to date and for which Els Highness can reasonably expect to receive compensauion from His Majesty's Government.

We have h&gt;e^n considering, in the light of Bagdad telegram No. 39 (H) Saving of the 10th April, what further progress is possible in regard to the problem oi the Sheikh of Kuwait's Date Gardens, and in this connection we have had before us the record of the informal meeting which was held at the Foreign Office on the 26th May to discuss outstanding problems connected with Kuwait. 2, in our view there are only two methods by which further progress can be made with the Date Gardens problem, vis:- (a) to expedite a settlement of the Saudi-Kuwait Blockade question, thus opening a way for the settlement of the Kuwait-Iraq, smuggling dispute, and consequently of the Date Gardens question; (b) to leave aside for the present the proposals lor securing a comprehensive settlement oi the Date Gardens question and revert to the earlier C-. W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office^ ^ S.W.I. suggestio n/Q L-J • suggestion of attempting to settle the 'taxation' aspect separately from, and in advance of, the 'possession' aspect. regards (a) the position is that we nave recently received from Bullard a revised Saudi version of the Trade Regulations which may prove acceptaole to the Sheikh; but in view of the insistence 01 the Saudi Government that, simultaneously with the Trade Agreement, there should be Agreements relating to Extradit ion and ^ Bon Voisinage, it seems inevitable that some consideiaole time must elapse before a settlement of this diflicult problem is reached; further periods, probably prolonged, would then have to be occupied in a settlement o^ uhe Kowait-Iraq smuggling question and, after that, oj- ^he Iraq aspects of the Date Gardens problem. In such circumstances we are strongly of opinion tn at, without awaiting the conclusion of this triple series of negotiations, an attempt should be mad e to secure a parti settlement of the Date Gardens problem on the lines suggested at (bj above; and subject to any observations which the Pontical Resident in the Persian Gulf (who is/is being consulted) may have to offer, we suggest that the Treasury should be asked to agree to the follov/ing proposition. 4. His Majesty's Government should now agree in principle to make a lump sum payment to the Sheikh of Koweit representing (a) the total amount ox his losses since 1932 which are directly attributable to the 7 'V..' imposition of the Istihlak tax plus (b) an amount fi'/C nmwYm—irr.iiuu irn^n sufficient to compensate for his future losses, calculated with reference to his present annual average loss. In return for this lump sum payment the Sheikh should be required to give a written recognition that this i^ayment released His Majesty's Government from their obligations under the 1914 pledge in respect of all future taxation. His Majesty's Government would, however, give their diplomatic support to the Sheikh should the Iraqi Government propose discriminatory taxation in future or claim for arrears of taxation for the period preceding 1952. The fact that the Sheikh was fixing an indemnity for the future might of course mean that the lump sum payment to the Sheikh might have to be somewhat higher than one based on a strict actuarial calculation, but the Treasury/4. Treasury would no doubt prefer this to the possibility of substantial further sums having to be produced in respect of taxation at a later date. 5. The proposed settlement with the Sheikh would not of course affect the possession question in any way. This would be left for Sieposai, when possible, by means of the land settlement procedure or by some other means. 6. It is not, of course, possible to forecast whether the Sheikh would be disposed to accept a solution on the lines indicated above, and in any case it is probable that there would have to be a good deal of discussion with him over the details. But we feel strongly that the proposal should be pursued, with as little delay as possible, if o nly to demonstrate that His Majesty's Government are really taking some steps to implement their undertakings. 7. As the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah's heirs must presumably be considered at the same time, we are inclined to think that it might be more convenient if the approach to the Treasury emanated from the Foreign Office. It would also be more proper from the constitutional point of view (see in this connection Hale's/letter will give you the necessary material for your c ommuni c at i o n. 8.

AMBASSADOR: I Sent under P,L, to Government of India, No. C/326 dated the 26th November 1937.I have taken a copy of thla for Buahire * * in zi/ f/n Mr.ClftUflon, D^te Gardens* I Agree generally with the Foreign Office draft and to materialise. I hare always been in favour, as I think have the I.O., of splitting up the date gardens question into two p^rts , (a) taxation, ^nd (b) possession, ^nd t**kin^ one step at a time. 'Comprehensive' agreements in regard to date gardens,or any other Gulf problem ,100^ well in Whitehall but do not work out on the spot. 2. The weak point in the P.O. scheme, as you point out, is that it offers contingent indemnities in respect of pre-1932 taxation and future discriminatory taxation to the Moharamerah heirs, and refuses the same contingent reliei to Kuwait on entirely inadeauate grounds. The tact t^t the lhaikh of Kuwait has exercised his undoubted international rights in refusing to co-operate with the Iraq Government over an entirely different matter - smuggling - in no way connected with his date gardens, certainly ices not justify H.M.G. in discriminsting against him. 5. He may, or may not, accept the ^.0. offer as it stands, but he will undoubtedly be strongly inclined to refuse it when he knows.that he is not getting the same terms as the ?*ohammerah heirs. That he will &lt;now this is, of course, certain, even if the heirs were asked by us to keep this pnrt of the arrangement confidential. If the Shaikh did accept the F.O.offer as it stands, knowing thqt better terms were being offered to the oha imerph heirs, he would only do so with a sense of grievance, and if he refuses it the mere fact of its being offered in these circinstances would in itself be a grievance^vhareeB the main point of a settlement of this question is to eradicpte any sense of grievance from his mind. It is essential, therefore, that rm thankful that something concrete seems likely at lastiq% the «am© tem« should be offered to the 3heikh as to the l r ohammerah heirs, either, as you suggest, by bringing Mohammerah terms in line with the Kuwait ones or vice versa. Mr. Simmond's compromise might also be suggested to the F,0. 4. Wy own view is that once H.' .G. have settled with the Shaikh of Kuwait, the Iraq Government will sooner or later try to (2) apply discriminntory taxation against him. Of these (2) is much more likely than (l). But these are risks that the Shaikh of Kuwait is in just as good a position to judge as we are, possibly better, since he keeps in close touch with Iraqi affairs snd know** several Iraqi politicians personally. This being so, he c^n refuse or accept the ^.O.offer on his own responsibility, whatever is its final form, provided always that he gets the •'nme terms as are offered to the Mohammerah heirs. 5.

Lawyer. Shaikh is anxious for lawyer to come at once especially as he now hears that case will come up before Basra Court on January 5th. 2. He hopes that he will be English from E^ypt (see yourSiote to Clauson dated the 16th September 1936 attached to India Office letter to Loch dated the 18th September). ^ POLITICAL AGENT. . 4*0s v. KUWAIT DATS OARDSM. o VtiJhM o^O / / / The position is aa follows: fe hold that Juridically the Shaikh of Kuwait is an independent aoverign. Therefore in international law he has immunity in process from foreign courts, i.e. those of Iraq. But in cases where title to real proper ty ia invoived international law admits an exception to the general rule conferring upon soveri^ns this immunity fe are, therefore, not in a position to refuse transmis sion of documents for service on the Shaikh on the sole ground that he is a soverign (paragraph 4 of Foreign Office letter of 27th April, 19 36). ATe therefore havs shifted our position from the general legal ground to the particular political ground as explained in para graph 6 of same 7orei^n Office letter, and further we will not assist service of docameiitfi on Snaikh (ibid paragraph 7). If we were to assist result would be / a flood of actions against the Shaikh (paragraph 8 ibid) which might prove embam-ssing to the Iraqi Government as explained in paragraph 10. These arguments of political expediency were, however, not conveyed to the Iraqi Government as a scheme for a comprehensive settlement of the date gar dens question under the Land Settlement Law was evolved by the Foreign Office, vide their letter of 2nd June. 3. This scheme failed, however, owing to insistence of the Iraqi Government in leaking date gardens with smuggling (see Baghdad telegram of 14th July, iqy tele- A * v ,J&gt;wa&gt;y h HO gram of 16th July and Foreign Office telegram of 17th July, 19 36). 4. The Iraq Government have now forced the issue ly authorising the courts to issue substituted service on/7- 0 * -2- on the Shaikh's agent in Basrah, vide Baghdad letter of 27th August, 1937, and these instructions have now actually been carried out, vide -uwait telegram of 18th Koveraber. presumably Iraqi law does not provide for substituted service since Ambassador points out thrt by changing the law they could make such service le^al* 5 # tfe can now defend the Shaikhs case (a) on the preliminary point that substituted service is not legal under Iraqi law and (b) if this fails, or if it succeeds only for the moment and the Iraqi Government amend the law^ on the merits. 6. ^ith regard to the merits of the case. The case in question consists of the claims against the Shaikh of the heirs of Zuhair (Kuwait telegram of 18th November) in the Pao Estate (vide list enclosed with Baghdad despatch Uo. 70 to Foreign Office dated 8th February, 1936). -I'M ^^ * 7. Immediate action Is for Shaikh to brief a lawyer to try and get a dismissal under (a) of claim or, at any rate, an injunction for stay of proceedings until (a) is decided. 8. A lawyer from Egypt should also be briefed by His llajesty^ Government to examine and to prepare to take up (b) t which will inevitably come into court sooner or later. Bahrain. 8.12. 1937.

While it is true that suits brought against the Shaikh of Koweit In respect of his real property In Iraq would normally have come within the scope of the exception admitted by International law to the general rule of immunity from process of foreign sovereigns. His Majesty's Government have never in the past been willing to asblst in the service of documents upon His Highness, since they feel that, in the special circumstances surrounding these cases, no obligation rests upon them to do so, but on the contrary they are under a positive oblitatlon to prevent such action bein^, brought, so far as they find that possible. Further more, in the view of His Majesty's Government, the Iraqi Crovemment share this responsibility for safeguarding the Shaikh's possession and ownership of his real property in Iraq, and they consider that the Iraqi Government are under an International obligation not to allow actions to proceed against the oiiaikh in respect of that property.U* ia . a jesty * a nsbacey are instructed to point out tnat any action taken to facilitate the cervlce of ocu.ient.8 up &gt;n he 1 halkh will probably encourage a Moo- oi actions KftsinBt His Highneos whlchf in the event jf the shaikh losing his casoB# mi^t prove hi hly e: ibanaaain £ and even prejudicial to the Iragl Governroent. ills a^esty * s Mb assy are therefo e to exy^res* the iiope that# in ? 11 the clreumntanoe-f he competent depart ient of tiie Ira^l nen ment will be willing to oaneel the iiatractlons that have set ally been issued to the Oourte arid to abstain froia ny further legislation designed to facilitate the brin in of act ions against the ihaikh of oweit in reopect of the ov;neiT,hlp of hia ate gar ens in Traq» 6.

After compliments. In reply to your letter No. c-292 dated 4.10.56 (7.12.37), I am pleased to inform you that the power of attorney granted to our agent in Iraq does not give him the right of acceptance of legal documents connected with the case, therefore, you can see that every effort made in this direction is illegal. We, relying on our right to our inherited properties. do not agree to give way and we are sure that H.B.M's Govt, knows the extent of these rights, and their legality, and knows too what is 'behind these efforts and the grounds on which they are supported. whatever H .b .M's g -ovt. deems fit. Therefore, I would like to know whether it would not impair our position, in future, 'before the Iraq.

The line we have taken hitherto with the Iraq GoTernment is that the Shaikh, as a foreign sovereign, enjoyed immunity from process in foreign courts. tie therefore refused to transmit for service on the Shaikh documents emanating from the Iraq courts, and as Iraqi lew does not provide for substituted service, the suits brought against the shaiki^c ould not be proceeded with. In April 1936 it was proposed to inform the Iraq^ against the Shaikh Crovernnent as the cases/referred to title to property, they were an exception to the general rule of immunity, but to maintain at the same time that the Iraq Government were under a definite international obligation toot to allow actions to proceed against the Shaikh in respect of his real property in Iraq. i i • This c onmunicat ion,however, was not made to the Iraq Government as subsequently a proposal for a com prehensive settlement of the whole question under the Vol.D-124, p.21.para.6.t&gt;3/l 1 the Land Settlement law was proposed (wiiicii, nowever, aaine to nothing)^ 2. Contesting in the Iraq Courts the ins true t ions of the Iraq Government, while conferring no permanent advantage, would give the Shaikh and H.M.G, seme more time. 3. The Shaikh has not got in .Iraqi law a clear title to all his properties in Iraq covered by H.M.G.'s pledge of 1914, particularly to the large Fadagniyen estate, and it is quite posalL ble that the Courts decision in some of the cases may go against him, vide Vol, D-117, P#^3, para. 6.

In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted by the British Government to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in World War 1.The correspondence discusses in detail a number of cases in the Iraqi courts regarding the gardens (by that time owned by the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ) and attempts made by British officials in Iraq and Kuwait to mediate between the two sides. In the correspondence, British officials discuss whether or not the British Government should compensate Shaikh Aḥmad for the amount of tax he had been forced to pay by the Government of Iraq and exactly what area of land was covered by the 1914 promise. More broadly, the correspondence is focused on how the disagreement can be settled permanently and whether an agreement incorporating border demarcations and anti-smuggling measures could form a part of any final settlement between Kuwait and Iraq. British officials also discuss whether an Egyptian lawyer should be hired to serve Shaikh Aḥmad and how much the Shaikh would be willing to contribute to the costs of this (ff. 38-43).The file also contains discussions amongst British officials following the death of Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī concerning whether or not the British promise made in 1914 was applicable to his descendants as well as the practical logistics of dealing with his numerous heirs. This includes direct correspondence between British officials and the administrator of Khaz'al al- al-Ka‘bī's estate in Iraq, Muhammad Ahmad.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001d4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
