Also covered are preparations for the drafting of a new treaty between the two parties (eventually concluded in December 1951 and ratified in May 1952).Related matters of discussion include the following: whether the Government of India should also exchange notes with the Sultan for the prolongation of the existing treaty; whether the Government of Pakistan should also be informed of the Sultan's wish to prolong the treaty; the question of whether the British consular authorities in Muscat should continue to exercise jurisdiction over residing Indian nationals for the extended period of the existing treaty.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; officials of the Foreign Office.Also included in the file are the following items: copies of drafts of the new treaty (ff 11-17 and ff 36-42); drafts of a protocol to the new treaty, produced by the Foreign Office and concerning consular functions and privileges (ff 27-29 and ff 31-34); a copy of a non-ratified consular convention between Britain and the United States of America, dated 16 February 1949 (ff 45-54).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000023#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000023#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000023#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
