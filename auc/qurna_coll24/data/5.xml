Born in Qurna, his family’s home was located near the ancient pharaonic-era tombs. Coming from a family of farmers who worked agricultural lands and raised livestock, Mohamed’s father also worked as a government employee in the irrigation service.  Mohamed describes the role of the women of the family in the household, including childcare, sewing, cooking, and carrying water from the well. He mentions aspects of traditional religion and spirituality, like zar and blessings from sheikhs, to which his family did not adhere, and their reliance on traditional herbal medicine rather than formal medical treatment. Mohamed relates that his family could not afford to send him to school, and mentions aspects of leisure like moulid festivals and ballplaying, as well as events like a visit to Qurna of Gamal Abdel Nasser. He describes the home he grew up in, as well as homes he built and rebuilt in Old Qurna after getting married, some of which were demolished by the Antiquities service at the time.  He recollects his military service, taking part in the 1973 October 6 War, and his later work as a sculptor for the government’s antiquities service on projects at the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir El Bahari and selling souvenirs to tourists.  He tells of interacting with tourists, and explains how the drop in tourism negatively affected the income of Mohamed and his sons, who had been in the tourist industry and are currently unemployed. He relates how he went on a hunger strike so that the government would provide a home for his family in a new area called Al-Soyool in New Qurna, where he currently resides. Mohamed discusses the government’s efforts to install electricity and sewage infrastructure and provide food subsidies, and claims that the house that the government provided after the relocation, and his life in general, are much better than had been the case on the Qurna hillside. </dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
