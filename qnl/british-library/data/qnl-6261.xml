On the 9th January I visited Tamb Island. I understand there are some five houses of Persians on the Island and fifteen of Arabs. 2. I saw some of the Persians who stated (ab that about a year ago the son of the Sheikh of Has ul Fhaima came to the Island and took away his father’s flag (b) that at the same time he recovered Rs.40/~ tribute from them. They stated that they expected another visit from the Sheikh’s men shortly and a demand for a further sum of Hs.40/- as annual tribute. They stated they could not possibly afford such a large sum and asked whether they had to pay it. In the absence of any information on the subject all 1 could say was that 1 would make ennui^ies. 3. /ith regard to (a' will you olease enouire from the Sheikh of Has ul Khaima whether he has in fact removed his flag and if so why. Although the Persian Government a-e unlikely to adopt an aggressive attitude in present circumstances, it is desirable that the Shaikh should continue to assert his claim. If therefore he has removed his flag he should be asked to send it back again. 1 understand it is the custom of the'is 1 anders to hoist it whenever a ship visits the island. It is of course possible that they have made away with it themselves in order to be in a better position to deny the Sheikh’s overlordship and to refuse to pay tribute. They certainly aooeared rather sheep-faced and as if they had something on their consciences when I talked with them. 4. ’'ith regard to (b) the islanders state that the Ihaikh - never demanded tribute before last year, is this true ? If we insist on the Sheikh asserting his rights over theisland we can hardly forbid him to exact tribute, though in view of th : 3 poverty of the islanders the sum should be little more than a nominal one The correct answer, however,to the islanders probably is ” v 0 u are the subjects of the Sheikh andyou must render to him whatever is due to him5. T may be visiting the island again in April if as rl hope I do another trio to Tuscat in the ' T ' T earchus ’then, should be grateful if before then you could let me know the facts so far as you may be able to ascertain them and also let me have any comments or suggestions you may wish to make.Confidential* D.O.No.C/109-19/1. British Agency, Sharjah, 25th January 1942. Dear Hr .Wake field, I saw the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah on 23rd January regarding the points raised by the Hon’ble the political Besidsnt in his Confidential letter No.C/8 dated 9th January 1942 to you a copy of which I received for report with your Confidential Endorse No.C/70 dated 15th January 1942. removed his flag from the Island of Tunb.He admits the importance of continuing to assert his claim to the Island but states that he does not get enough income from it even to pay for the expense of employing a special man whose duty would be to look after the hoist ing* of the flag. This duty, he says, has been entrusted to one of the Islanders by him and is generally performed. The Shaikh is always at pains to see that a flag is kept on the Island as soon oa he learns that a new one is needed. My impression was that the fl^ hoisting is performed with the ordinary degree of care give to an; every year but no fixed amount and nwer an excessive amount. I believe this statement gives a fair representation of what happens. He also said that his son did levy an amount from some of the Isl 2 . The Shaikh denies that either he or his son have ever routine duty in these parts. I impressed upon the Shaikh the import ance of it. 3. The shaikh says that he dees take tribute from the Isla^v&amp;v^ ers who were acting at that time as storages of goods being smugg^ from the Coast to Persia.

Dear Colonel Hay, Will you please refer to your memorandum No. C/8 dated the 9th January 1942 ? 4 2. Polly tackled the Shaikh of ^as al Khaimah on the subject of Tamb Island, and I enclose a copy of his report. 3. The Shaikh seems to have avoided making definite statements of fact e.g. he does not give the name of the islander entrusted with the flag, nor does he state the actual sum of money which his son levied as tribute. This may have been deliberate evasion, but is more probably a reflection of his own ignorance of detailed facts. 4. The mere fact that inquiries have been made about the flag and the levy of excessive tribute will probably be sufficient to ensure that the Shaikh is, in future, more careful about the former and more considerate about the latter. I will not, therefore, unless you instruct me to the contrary, pursue the matter further with the Shaikh. 5. As to the islanders, a reply to the effect that their increased ’’tribute' included a penalty for smuggling would not be untrue and might prove salutary.

The Resident is likely to visit Tamb Island again in mid April on the 'Nearchus' and expects to see the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah* s flag flying there. I suggest that, if you see no objection, the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah should be informed of the Resident’s proposed visit and of his expectation that he will see the Ras al Khaimah flag hoisted when the w Nearchus w is sighted. 3.

I beg to- report that in the morning of the 31st August 1 received information that trouble had broken out the previous day between shaikh sultan bin salim, Kuler of has al Kliaim&amp;h, on the one side and his brother shaikh Muhammad bin salim and nephews shaikhs humaid, kayid, seqr, salim, Abdullah and ttamad on the other side. Mext day 1 obtained further details which are as followsi- Having received reports that his nephews have plotted against him, the shaikh of Has al khaimah suddenly manned his fort, held strategic points in the town, erected sand bag barricades and postoc a garrison in command of his second son seer in Mua 1 ireedh villcige situated on the other side of the creek and stopped all traffic to and from the town and village. His brother, nephews and about 8o of the inhabitants were in the gardens, about 3 miles away, where they usually live in summer. On 30th August, when two of his nephews shaikhs salim and Abdullah tried to go t© kua’ireedh villag&lt; they were fired on by the shaikh*6 garrison and h&amp;d to return to the gardens, shots then continued to be fired from the town and village but no one was hit. It was soon announced that the shaikh 1 1 action was directed against his brother and nephews whom he does not want to come to Has al khaimah. Immediately on hearing the news, the Shaikh of sharjah sent his brother shaikh Mifemmad bin saqr to Ras al khaimah to mediate on his begalf. He met both parties and then sent a message to his brother inviting him to come in person to Has al Khaimah and try to settle the dispute. He accordingly left for has al Khaimah today. Two of the shaikh of Ras al Mhaimah»s nephews kayid and saqr came to see me on the 1st of September and handed over to me a letter from their father and a petition signed by 30 of Has al khaimah*s residents, enclosed in original with translation. 3. It is rumoured that the shaikh of Ras al khaimah had stated that he had proof that a jklot had been organised against him by his nephews ana that he would prefer to abdicate rather than allow them/-them to live i# the town a&amp;ain* He does not, of course, intend to abdicate but he says so in older to find out the leanings of the other shaikhs who volunteer to mediate. His forces are estimated to be about 100 bedouins, ihe town and village are now in the hands of the shaikh; whereas the gardens and outlying villages including sharisha date-gardens which supply Mua^reeoh village with drinking water are held by his brother and nephews. The Shaikh has also broken into the house of his nephews in the town. 4. There axe about 13 British inaien subjects in Has-al- Khaimah and I have warned both sides that they will be held responsible for the safety of all sritish subjects and their property. 6. The shaikh of Rams w-ho is under has al nhaimah has written to Shaikh Muhammad bin selim offering his support but no much reliance can be placed on his word. The way from the gardens to Rams, a distance of about 12 miles, is open and 1 have made arrangements for the distribution of foodstuffs to the people v.he are in the gardens as well as those in the town at Rams and wrote to the shaikh of Rams inviting his co-operation. 6. 1 had already reported in Trucial toast A.ews Reports Nos. 13 &amp; 15 of 1&amp;46 the events that leu to the present situation and it now remains to be seen whether the efforts of the shaikh of sharjah will meet with any success. 7. I should be grateful for guidance in case both or one of the parties invoke our help or intervention. f- ? 3Translation of letter dated flil from shaikh Muhammad tin sa.lim to the Residency A&amp;ent, ish&amp;rjah (received ©n 1«9«46;• After compliments, I write to report to you the incident which was brought about by my brother sultan bin salim* On Friday the 3rd of shawwal 1365 fi.e. 30*8.46;, my sons Salim and Abdullah proceeded to the town via Mua’ireedh village, not knowing that evil was in store for them.

On the receipt of ycur telegram No.241 dated the 16th of September 1946, I authorised the issue of one half of the quantity to Has al Khaimah. The Shaikh of Ras-al- Khaimah was greatly worried over the matter of the diversion of foodstuffs and remarked that if the previous arrangements continued lor some time the people would desert him and/consequently be in a difficult position. 3. He then talked to me about the present troubles and said that he took these steps against his nephews for their organising a plot to overthrow him and also for numorous acts of highhandedness and oppression of the people. He then showed me a list of brutal acts alleged to have been committed by his nephews against the people amongst whom were a number of British subjects. In my opinion, this list contained a great deal of distorted facts and untrue accusations as no British subject did ever come to the Agency to complain against his nephews and his object in quoting British subjects is obviously to make his case strong anc bring us to his side. He could not produce any proof that his nephews did actually plot to depose or murder him and simply relied on a story carried to/-C982«022c* Sharjah 21»t aaptambar 1946# political, Bahrain my telegram jNtt.970 dated tht 19th &amp;epten,b«r 1946. 2.

Note on Ras A1 Khaimah affairs.CONFIDENTIAL British Agency, Sharjah. Dated the 30th September, 1946 To The Political Agent, Bahrain. Note on Has al Khalmah affairs. As reported in my telegram No. 1004 of 27th September, 1946, I held discussions with Shaikh Sultan bin Salim and Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim separately, at Sharjah on the 25th and 26th September. There were two meetings with both Shaikhs, Shaikh Sultan seeing me first on each occasion. I also saw Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah, Afesrai Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid of Ajman, and Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed of Kalba at the Agency. These three Shaikhs have been mediating in the dispute. 2. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Ras al Khaimah told me his side of the story, why he had taken action against his brother and Nephews etc., and what his proposed future action was. He related a number of accusations against his nephews vizs- (1) That they had fired at a British subject, Major Holmes, about 10 years ago. (2) That they had beaten local merchants. (3) That they had plotted to murder him at the end of Ramadhan. Apart from No. (3) the accusations Shaikh Sultan made were most unconvincing, and when I asked him why he had not taken action himself for the alleged offences, or informed Political Officer, Srucial Coast, he said that he had done nothing as he wanted peace and did not like to make a fuss. As regards the alleged plot to murder him Shaikh Sultan stated that on the day before the Id celebrations he was informed by the Amir of Shamal that the sons of Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim had approached the Amir asking him to help in recruiting men for a coup d ! etat to overthrow Shaikh Sultan. On hearing this Shaikh Sultan manned the town of Ras al Khaimah and Muareedh village and stopped all persons entering from the gardens. This was on the first day of Id. ( I would mention here that the majority of the Ras al Khaimah population were out in the gardens as is their custom at this time of the year ). Shaikh Sultan then stated that he lifted the ban on entry the next day, but had not and would not allow any member of his brother*s family to enter Muareedh or Ras al Khaimah, as he was firmly convinced that his nephews were trying to murder him. He mentioned that he had nothing against his brother Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim, but that it was his nephews whom he really suspected. I asked him if he had any further proof of the plot against him, but he had none, and the information the Amir of Shamal gave him appears to be the only reason for provoking him to action. He stated very definitely that he would not consider his brother or nephews ever liming in Ras al Khamiah again, as he would never be safe; he then quoted as a parallel how the Regent of Kalba had been expelled from Sharjah and he said that similar action should be taken against his brother and nephews, and that he was prepared to do this forcibly if necessary. On this note he left, as I did not wish to say anything until I had / seen • • »seen Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim. 3. I then held an interview with Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim who was accompanied by his two sons Humaid and Chaid. He related much the same history of events as regards the ban on their entry on the day of Id as was told me by Shaikh ^ultan. He then went on to say that he could not understand his brother^ attitude, that he had always been friendly with him, that they were one family and closely intermarried. He strongly denied the accusation that his sons had plotted to murder Shaikh Sultan and said that the Whole case was a £aoex fabrication of lies on the part of ^haikh Sultan. He mentioned that he himself had abdicated in favour of Shaikh °ultan, and that he always preferred peaceful relations within the family and had no ambition to be the Ruler. He declared that neither he nor his nephews would consider leaving Ras al Khaimah, where they had all their belongings and owned many houses, and that if necessary they would fight. He stated that his position was serious, that Shaikh Sultan was denying them food ( the Shaikh refuted this to me),~and that they would very soon have lio leave the gardens and go back to their houses. Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim then told how the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ajman had been trying to bring about a settlement but had failed owing to the obstinate attitude of Shaikh Sultan. He asked me at this point if Government would intervene and bring about justice as mediation by tribal Shaikhs had failed. I replied that Government did not interfere with purely internal affairs amongst tribes, but that I would give the whole case consideration. 4. I then saw Shaikh Sultan bin Salim again on the 26th and gave him my opinion as follows (a) That the situation had been brought about largely by his own neglect of affairs in the past and weakness of control in not checking at the time the people responsible for the offences which he had told me about. (b) ‘^hat his action in suddenly manning the town, in opening fire and banning entry into the town had been hasty and ill-considered. (c) That by expelling his brother and nephews from his territory he would not achieve a real answer to the problem, as they would remain his enemies and undoubtedly try to obtain their revenge. I then asked him, in view of the above, to reconsider the whold matter and see if he could find another solution than resort to force. Meanwhile he was to take no action until I saw him again next week. This he promised to do, if his brother would give a similar undertaking. Before leaving, he again stated that he would not tolerate the presence ofhis brother and nephews in Ras al Khaimah, and that he could not be responsible for the safety of the oil- prospectors who might be interfered with in the area where his brothers and nephews were. I pointed out that he was responsbile for all his Shaikhdom 0 He was veiy adamant in his belief that his life was in danger from the plots and intrigues of his nephews* in fact his general demeanour throughout the discussion was very nervous. He did not ask once for Government help, so he presumably thinks he is strong enough to expel his brother and nephews by force. He asked if he might build a tower over some wells out side Maureedh village and near his brothers position. I advised him not to and he agreed not to do this. He promised that he would distribute food equitably, and that he would not withhold food supplies from his brother. (The Residency Agent had originally diverted half the Ras al Khaimah food supplied to Rams, and this has considerable effect on Shaikh Sultan and he was most anxious about it. In view of there being free movement to and from Ras £ al Khaimahal Khaimah, Residency Agent was since instructed to supply the whole quota to Ras al Khaimah itself. In my opinion the control of the distribution of food stuffs is our best lever should we wish to bring pressure to bear in this case). 1 then saw Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim again, told him that Shaikh Sultan would take no action until I had seen him again, and I asked Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim to do the same to which he agreed. 6* He then emphasised the importance of the return of his family and followers from the gardens to Ras al Khaimah to their homes, as it was a bad time for sickness in the gardens. I told him to be patient as the matter was under consideration. Both the Shaikhs returned from Sharjah on the 27th. As regards foodsupplies Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim stated that Shaikh Sultan had withheld food supplies from him. (Shaikh Sultan had denied this to me). 6* The situation appearing to be one of stalemate, both sides being firm in their own aims, but ready to obey Government orders, I called for Shaikh of Sharjah, Ajman, and Kalba to obtain their views. The Shaikh of Sharjah is closely related to the Ras al Khaimah families and he and his brother have been mediating in the case, and have up to now been maintaining with some success a period of truce between the two parties. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr mentioned how he had persistently tried to get Shaikh Sultan of Has al Khaimah to agree to his brother and nephews return, and that he would guarantee their good behaviour. However, Shaikh Sultan bin Salim had been very obstinatethroughout and repeatedly refused all idea of allowing his nephews to return. In Shaikh of Sharjah’s opinion, the accusation by Shaikh Sultan bin Salim that the Amir of Shamal had been approached by the nephews with the object of raising a revolt against the Ruler was entirely false, as he himself interviewsed the Amir of Shamal. The Shaikh of Sharjah then gave it as his opinion that Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim and nephews, owning considerable property in Has al Khaimah and having a big following, could not leave the town and that it would be an injustice for them to have to do so. He then stated that it was only by Government intervention that considerable bloodshed and its attendant unrest and protected feuds c could be avoided. He thought that both parties would obey at once whatever Government decided. I gave him a non-committal reply and thanked him for his effort to keep the peace, which indeed he has done so far. Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid of Ajraan and Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed of Kalba were of the same opinion as the Shaikh of Sharjah, and earnestly invoked Government intervention. Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed suggested, off the record, that two of Shaikh Sultan’s sons, Salim and Khalid, and two of Shaikh Mohammed’s sons, Saqr and Abdulla, be exiled for a period of 6 months. This was the only novel suggestion offered. Apparently Shaikh Sultan bin Salim resented Shaikh Khalid's presence as a mediator as Shaikh Khalid himself had been expelled by the Shaikh of Sharjah under similar circumstances some years ago. 7. (a) In conclusion I would emphasise that whatever policy is now adopted, either to intervene or not to intervene, we should now declare that policy as soon as possible. (b) In view of the programme of the P.C # L # prospectors, to work in the Ras al Khaimah area a state of unrest and fighting is most undesirable. (c) I think it is the general desire, and it is becoming greater than ever before, on the part of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs that Government should control more directly, and intervene in tribal / disputesf^jgpfr ,g| disputes. This is I believe in contravention to our policy that has been followed upto now. (d) With particular reference to this Ras al Khaimah dispute, which is admittedly between two Shaikhs of one family, I offer the following suggestions for what they are worths- (i) Government order Shaikh Sultan bin Salim to allow the return of Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim and his family to Ras al Khaimah and to live there. (ii) Government get guarantee of good behaviour and loyalty to the Ruler from Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim, which if even broken means his expulsion together with his family, by Government from Ras al Khaimah. To enforce N/Para.(i) should Shaikh Sultan bin Salim disagree, sanctions on food supply could be levied, and if necessary the visit of a sloop to Ras al Khaimah be arranged. Finally, I would request that I may be given early instructions in this case, and authority to declare our policy to try to bring to an end, &amp;Bk unsettled state of affairs now existing in Ras al Khaimah.

T was not previously aware that the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah’s jurisdiction extended so far south. I enclose herewith a blueprint of the area. I shall be very grateful if you would kindly enter in it the approximate course followed by the road from Shinas to Sharjah and indicate on it the point where the Sultan of Muscat’s jurisdiction ends and that of the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah begins. Considerable use is now made of this road and in the event of incidents occurring on it it is of some importance to know in whose jurisdiction they take place.Confidential. i ; D#0.110.9 6.02S3 British Agonoy, Sharjah, Datod, 25th January, 1948. Dear Mr.Pelly, Please refer to your deni-official letter No.c/1186 dated the 14th December, 1947. 2. It so happened that the dividing line between the Sultan of Muscat’s and the Shaikh of Has al Klirinoh’n jurisdiction in the vicinity of the track through the : r adi cl qaur is fairly closely defined and is not, as far as I on aware, disputed by either side, although this night be confteiod from Muscat. The extremity of Muscat territory is narked Tajr a tower belonging to Muscat which overlooks the track where it passes near to village Aswad. Village Aswad, which is narked on tho blue print of the area, is in ^Tuocat territory. From Sharjah to the western entr anco of tho Wadi el Qaur there are two routes; the shorter, via Oud el Matina and south of Jabal Paynh; and tho longer vie Herat al Karo*a, Palaj ol Ali. Dhald, Honda and Fill. I v/ent b;r the former route and returned by the latter when I visited Kalba last week; and X narked then approximately on the blue print of the area. I also narked the course of the track through the Wadi el Qaur to Al Murair. ^« From Al 'uralr I understand the track runs through Khadhrawain to Shinas ? although I did not traverse it myself. that he is impotent to maintain security. Previously he did so through the agoncy of Humaid bin Abdullah, the Hegont of TCalba’s nephe\/, whom he paid for this service. Humid is novr too debauched to porforn it.

During my absence in Abu Dhabi Saqr bin Pbhammad bin Salim third nephew of Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah seized the town of Ras al Khaimah with consent of inhabitants and aid of Khawatir tribe. He arrested sons of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim and later released them and sent them and their families to Sharjah. Sultan bin Salim was at the time in Dubai and appealed to Sharjah for aid. Sharjah himself went to Ras al Khaimah but was unable to dffect anything. All the family of Sultan bin Salim are now in Sharjah and Saqr bin Mihammad has asked for our recognition of him as Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah. There was no bloodshed and there is peace and order in Ras al Khaimah. Report will follow after I have visited Ras al Khaimah. -POLITICAL-Translation of letter dated 30th Rahi al Avrwal 1367 (10-2-48) from Saqr bin Muhammad bin SaLim al Qasindf to the Residency Agent, Sharjah. After Compliments, You may be aware that after the unjustified measures which our uncle Shaikh Sultan bin Salim had taken against us last year and his prohibiting our entry into the town, he eventually offered to us certain conditions after which we returned to the town and friendship and cordiality were once more restored. On our part we fully preserved those conditions during all that period and did not act against them. But it is to be regretted our uncle soon began to act against the agreement; he broke one of its principal terms by failing to pay us our allowances, treating the people in a cruel manner and not protecting their interests. The inhabitants expressed their indignation and appealed to us to save them from tyranny and oppression. We resporfjjpd to their appeal and seized the town with their aid. Thank God our efforts were crowned with success. We send you herewith the document which the inhabitants presented to us showing that I have seized power in Ras al Khaimah and its dependencies. I would inform you that I accept all treaties and agreements concluded between the Rulers of Ras al Khaimah and Great Britain and the British firms. I am also always prepared in to help the Government^any matter in which she may need assistance. Usual Endingt% The voice of the people of Ras al Khairoah. Dated: 29th Rabi Awwal 1367 (9.2.48) We, the undersigned, do hereby declare that we have chosen Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad bin Salim al Qasimi as a Ruler for us and have given him God’s pledge that we shall hear and obey him. Shaikh Saqr, on his part, has undertaken to do all in his power to protect our interests to give the same treatment to both the strong and the weak and not to neglect us or subject us to oppression and tyranny as Shaikh Sultan bin Salim did during his reign.

D.O.No.156.0223 Dear Mr* Pelly, Please refer to my telegram No* 143 dated the 13th Februaryt 1948* 2* I and the Residency Agent spent the 15th February in Has al Khaimah* I later saw Sultan bin Salim at the Agency on the 18th* I had not been able to get hold of him before. 3* In Has al Khainuih I found Shaikh Saqr bin Muharrmad bin Salim in charge assisted and advised by his father and by his elder brother Shaikh Humaid bin fuhammad* Most of the guards formerly employed by Sultan bin Salim had come over to Saqr and# in addition# he had received help from the Khavatir and from the Shaikh of Jazirat al Hamra* Members of the public intervieved separately thoroughly approved of the change in regime. 4* It appears that Sultan bin Salim had feared such a coup d f etat ever since the sons of Muhammad bin Salim# whom Sultan bin Salim displaced from the Shaikhship 29 years ago# reached maturity* In anticipation of it# he had removed to Dubai all his movable property except a few pieces of furniture Locked boxes in his house were found to be empty# and he had in Has al Khaimah no arms except one rifle# and no ammunition. In addition, where he could collect taxes and customs dues in advance he had done so by issuing drafts on merchants who usually have to pay customs duties* Allowances due from him in recent months had been similarly met# so that in effect they were in arrears. Considering that he has# as far as I can gather# disbursed very little indeed to facilitate the Oil Company^ work# it appears that he has got away with most C.J. Pelly# Lsquire# 0*B#B*# Political Ag nt, Bahrain. British Agency# Sharjah Dated 21st Feb# 1948.of the money paid for this purpose, leaving his successors with the responsibility, an empty treasury, and the taxes mortgaged for some time to come. 5. After his expulsion from Has al Khaimah Sultan bin Salim also sent his second and third sons to occupy the village of Manat* because it produces a revenue of Rs. 15,000/- a year from tobacco cultivation. 6. I found Saqr and his father most reasonable and anxious for our recognition and support. Vithout funds and with many demands upon them - some of them legacies of responsibility from Sultan bin Salim -, they recognize the weakness of their position. They are willing to subscribe to all previous agreements with H.M.G. and to the Oil Concessi 7. They appear to have dealt most fairly with the family and property of Sultan bin Salim. No one was injured and all were allowed to leave and to take their movable property with them. Only the house of Salim, Sultan bin Salim £ eldest son, was looted by the Khawatir. His rifle was, however, redeemed and returned to him by Muhammad bin Salim. Saqr is also reluctant to sequester Sultan bin Salim’s date gardens in has al Khaimah, or to attach the income from them. He and his father stated that Sultan bin Salim had requested them through Muharmmd bin Saqr to give him an llowance and up not to half of the royalties from oil. \vhile/knowing how they would meet this expenditure they appeared to favour giving Sultan bin Salim a small allowance, if only to stop him intriguing against them. They asked rny advice and said that they would again consult us before finally deciding. 8. When Sultan bin Salim saw me it was clear that he had given up any idea of regaining his position as Shaikh, unless he could get H.M.G’s support. Even he, supreme optimist that he is, appeared to realize that with a record like his he could hardly hope for that. Before coming to ue he had tried all other meane to regain his Shaikhdom and had3 failed. He has no friends in Ras al Khairnah and no Trucial Shaikh able to do so is willing to help him. 9. He then said that he wanted an allowance. I informed him that if he wanted our assistance he should ^irst explain what had happened to all the oil payments* hacause it was clear that he had not disbursed any hut small amounts to facilitate the Company^ work. He alleged that all his wealth had been kept in gold in Ras al Khaimah and had been looted by Saqr; but in face of the evidence of his lack of precautions in Ras al Khaiirah and of his prolonged and frequent visits to* and residence in* Dubai he could not maintain this excuse. Instead* he much modified his demand for an allowance. Asked if he would accept from his successor identical treatment that he as Shaikh accorded to him* he &gt; said that he would do so provided that any allowances agreed the upon were paid throught/Agency• I replied that would not be identical treatment and -hat, had his brother’s and nephew’s allowances been paid through the Agency or indeed paid at all, he would probably not have been expelled. 10. To conclude: I think that Saqr has the support of the people of Ras al Khairah* of the Khawatir and the Shaikh of Jazirat al Hamra, and of his five brothers. From what we know of him I think he has the attributes of a good Shaikh. He is amenable to our influence and is likely to be so for some years to come. In time he will probably also be able effectively to help the Oil Company to work their concession. His present weakness is due to lack of money but, with our recognition^he would receive the customs and other revenues of the Shaikhdom^ and payments from the Oil Company. Vith frugality they should suffice to meet his responsibilities; and as time passes he should be able to strengthen his financial position. I recommend that we recognize him on conditions similar tc those recommended in the Kalba case - ray D.O. Ho. 94.0220 dated the 25th January, • 1948 •4 aim m ^ — 7 H• Sultan bin Salim hast I think#' no chance of reinstating himself as Shaikh; and his sons have not the courage# the influence# or the money to do so. Indeed# his eldest son has already complained that his father has given him nothing for his maintenance. He has had to pawn his fountain pen. Sultan bin Salim is# however# likely to continue to intrigue. It is# I believe, usual to give deposed Shaikhs some allowance; and the fact that he behaved so badly to his brother does not mean that his successor should behave badly to him. If asked for advice again# I think we should inform Saqr that he should work out the problem with Sultan bin Salim himself# but that we favour his being given a small allowance# although for the first year at any rate the allowance# and possibly the income from his gardens# might have to be offset against the customs duties he collected in advance before leaving and against the dues he left unpaid. To Shaikh Sultan we should intimate that we have withdrawn our recognition from him, that he should withdraw his sons and his men from Manai* and the Vadi el Q,aur# and that he should not intrigue against his successor. 12. I do not think there is any chance of our recovering from him any of the funds that he has got a^ay with^or that it is practical to try to do so. The idea of separate State funds and a privy purse for the Ruler is quite unknown on the Trucial Coast. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim’s conduct over a period of years# however# is a good illustration of the extent to which the Jawasim Shaikhs regard the income of their Shaikhdom$ as their own personal property to be enjoyed arbitrarily# and an illustration of the extent to which they shirk the responsibilities of nulership. The whole emphasis of Sultan bin Salim’s recent talks with me was on his claims to the wealth of the Sheikhdom# even after he had surrendered all control and responsibility.mm v/r a 46 - ^ POLIPICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN.

At Dhald he collected round him a number of bedouin of the Avamir, Wuhibah, Duru', Hai** and to All bin Saif of the Khawatir of Rasal Khaimah asking him to come to Dhaid to negotiate with him for the return of the camels, rifles and house-hold effects alleged to have been stolen by the Khawatir from his son's house at Ras al Khaimah at the time of the coup d’etat. 3. Sultan bin Salim later visited Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad at Hira and asked him to let him occupy Dhaid Fort. Shaikh Khalid refused to permit him to do so. Sultan bin Salim then called on Shaikh Rahmah bin Abdur Rahman of Hira and invited him to stay with him at Dhaid. Shaikh hahmah bin Abdur Rahman also refused. 4. There were indications that Sultan bin Salim Intended to instal himself in Dhaid and to use it a base from which to harass his brother and nephew in Ras al Khaimah, and to bring pressure on the Khawatir, who are supporting them. 3. For Sultan bln Salim to remain in Dhaid and to collect Awamir and Manasir bedouin round him was likely to lead to insecurity in the desert and to trouble for the new Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah. For this reason I asked Sultan bin Salim Manasir, and he sent a message through the Shaikh of AJman C.J.Felly, Esquire, O.B.E., Political Agent, BAHRA^2 - to meet me in the Agency and warned him that he should desist from intrigue, should continue to live in Dubai as hitherto, and should only go to Dhaid for the bona fide purpose of attending to his gardens. He denied all intention to create trouble for his nephew, and undertook not to visit Dhaid again without first informing me or the Residency Agent of his intention to visit Dhaid and of the reasons for his visit.
