This laxity can obviously only have arisen froni^ a want of adequate appreciation of the responsibility resting upon those to whose care these important seciet documents have been entrusted ; and in order that there may be no misunderstanding in the future as to the serious nature of these responsibilities, the (Jommander- in-Chief wishes all concerned to be informed that he intends to take the severest notice of any future neglect of the orders. 3. Under His Excellency’s directions a copy of this letter will be attached to ail documents, the secret nature of which may necessitate their being issued for the per sonal information of those concerned. Simla : The 1st June 1908, } B. DUFF, Lieut.-General, Chief of the Staff.PREFACE. In 1886 Major-General Sir E. H. H. Collen brought to the notice of the Government of India that no concise account existed, issued periodically either hy the Intelligence Branch or the Foreign Department, of the advance and progress of Russia in Central Asia. Consequently, orders were issued direct ing the preparation and publication of a short monthly review of the military position of Russia in Central Asia with regard to the disposition of the troops, changes in general administration or organisation, the progress of the railways, and any other important points concerning which information might be obtained. Experience proved that such a review would be more valuable and accurate if issued at longer intervals of time. In 1899, therefore, Bis Excellency Lord Curzon directed that these summaries should be issued only annually, and that their scope should be enlarged to include Persia, Afghanistan, and the North- West Frontier generally. In 1903 the Summary was further extended by the addition oi a prdm of the events, which had occurred in the eastern countries dealt with in the Intelligence Branch. The present Summary, which is considerably fuller than its predecessors, is now issued under the orders of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in India in the hope that it may he found equally interesting and valuable. As much of its contents are of a secret character, every precaution should be taken to prevent unauthorised persons obtaining access to it. Any errors or omissions which may be observed should be brought to the notice of the Intelligence Branch, Division of the Chief of the Staff. Simla: ^ W. MALLESON, Lieut.*Colonel, &gt; Asst.

The following reports were received during the year of the work of Russian reconnoitrers and agents in and towards (a) Afghanistan and (6) Chinese Turkistan:— (a) Afghanistan —At the end of December 1906 three Russian Engineer officers returned from Afghanistan which, it was added, was frequently visited by Russian officers, disguised as Turkomans and accompanied by Afghans in their pay. Two Russian officials, possibly being two of the three officers mentioned above, stayed at Shirabad from about mid-December 1996 to mid-January 1907, and, after making an inspection of the Oxus, returned via Charjui to Samarkand. In Eebruary it was reported that two Afghans, viz, :—Tordi Kul of Maimana and Baba Khan of Khojakand, residing in Russian territory at Charsbamba and Shaikh Junaid respectively, were employed as agents in Afghanistan. In the following month Muhammad Niaz of Andkhui was expelled from Afghanistan on suspicion of supplying the Russians at Kerki with information. In March Mazar-i-Sharif was visited by Col. Kirkorashtabof, an officer who has passed through the course of Oriental languages at Tashkent. In the same month and at the same place two Russian spies were arrested and taken to Kabul. This incident may, perhaps, be that reported from another source in the previous month which stated that three spies had been arrested at Gborband and were deported to Kabul, one of them dying en route. In August two Russians were caught by the Afghan Guard at Kerki and were returned to Russian territory, after which it was discovered that they were officers. In the same month a Russian soldier from the Patta Kesar garrison was also arrested in Afghanistan. In August, a reconnaissance of Shirabad, Kulab, Hissar, Deh-Nau, and the Karateghin district was carried out by 4 Russian officials. In November information was received that— (i) Muhammad Husain Beg—cacte (6)—and Abdulla Beg, both of Shig- nan, who were suspected to be Russian spies, had escaped to Rus sian territory; (ii) Shah Kul, a Turkoman of Russian Darwaz, had been expelled across the Oxus on suspicion of acting as a Russian spy in Afghan istan where he was practising as a Hakim; (iii) Tulsi, a Hindu, en route from Bokhara via Kabul to India as a faMr, had been sent back to Bokhara on suspicion; and (iv) orders had been given to the Afghan border authorities to make careful enquiries regarding all Hindus in Bokhara and Samar kand. (b) Chinese Turkistan.—lxi Eebruary two suspected Russian spies, Sabir and Akbar, who, according to reports from Sarikol, had been sent by Saiyid Abdur Rahman of Russian Wakhan, wers detained at Gupis en route to Chitral and were subsquently sent back via the Karumbar Pass. In the same month Kharkosh Beg of Sarikol, a Russian agent, migrated to Bozai Gumbaz owing to rumours that the Amir was about to hand over Wakhan to the British. In June, however, he returned to Taghdumbash. ..Throughout the portion of the Sutnfloary dealing with Russia in Asia the abbreviation Rs. stands for rublo? and not for rupees. Secret2 This man spends the greater part of the year at Wakhijru near the Kilik pass and obtains news from Wakhis, etc. On the occasion of the visit of Sikandar Khan, C.I.E., Mir of Nagar, to the Taehdumbash Pamir, one Miskin, Yasawal of r J ask-Kurghan, was sent by the ^Russian officer from Tash-Kurgkan to interview the Mir and collect information. In June Saiyid Hasan of Kulab, who had been arrested at Mastuj and been deported by the Baroghil Pass, w?is arrested by the Afghans at Sarhad- i-Wakhan and sent to Eaizabad in Badakhshan. In April the following Sarikolis were described as pro-RussiansChiang Ta-lao-yieh, the new Araban or Tung-kuan of Sarikol; Kazi Muhammad, the new Beg of Sarikol and Karawal Beg of Mint aka ; Miskin, the Yasawal; Haring; and Muhammad Husain who has been resident in the Khunjerab for the last 10 years and is probably identical with Muhammad Husain Beg of Shighnan, mentioned under {a) and perhaps, too, with Muhammad Husain Oulam of Tiznif. As regards the first two, vide also p. 31. In July another Sarikoli. one Haris, visited the Mintaka and Khunjerab. In the following month a suspected spy, Tordi Kul of Shighnan, who may be identical with the Tordi Kul of Charshamba mentioned above, arrived at Zebak. Russo-Afghan Relations. See also Russian Secret Service. It was reported in September that Kundan Khan, Nazir of Sirdar Ishak khan, had returned to Afghanistan with 20 other Afghans. In March the Russians appear to have adopted a more conciliatory attitude towards Ishak Khan who three months later was the guest of the Governor-General at Tashkent, whence he returned shortly after wards to Samarkand, his place of permanent residence. About the same time it was reported that his sons were desirous of returning to Afghanistan. At the end of October a Russian oihcer of high rank from Tashkent visited Ishak Khan at Samarkand apparently with a view to explain to him that the Anglo-Russian convention would not affect Russian policy in Afghanistan. In August it was reported that the Russians had cut off communication with Afghan territory and also were endeavouring to prevent correspondence between such of their subjects as are murids of the Aga Khan whom the Russians consider no friend of theirs. So far as Afghan territory is concerned, this rumour was confirmed some two months later when it was added that the Russians were giving very few permits to their subjects to travel in Badakhshan ; and by Becember Maulai disciples, were definitely forbidden to leave Russian territory to visit their priests in British limits In September an increase of Russian posts on the Panja was observ ed. These precautions may possibly have been taken in anticipation of the Amir’s proposed visit to Badakhshan and Kafiristan. But it appears more probable that they were intended to conceal Russian movements in this neighbourhood, for in October it was rumoured that the Russians* had eneroach- ed on the Afghan Pamirs, a rumour confirmed by an official of Afghan Faizabad : Prom the information given by the latter it would seem that the Russians are endeavouring to push their frontier southwards from the Nicholas Range, along which it is deBned by but few pillars, to the Wakhan ir°rci Bozai Gumbaz upwards. Further confirmation of the news of difficulties between the Afghans and Russians is contained in rumours preva- lent at Osh and Andijan in August that there had been a disagreement over a mme m Shighnan. In October an Afghan official proceeded to the Little Pamirs to endeavour to arrange matters. . ,. A, ' 0 !- lt t J ie time Russian cartridges were discovered in the possession of Kirghiz at Aktash; 60 families, in fear of the consequences, fled to Afghan territory m the middle of October, while four families moved to the BmoX” after a skirmish with siv Cossacks who were forced to withdraw. None of these families had returned to Russian territory by the end of the year3 'Kill a S#,ti ^ sent wiled ‘CliiaQs W, asaaal; ^jm!) in Be* Husaii ln jorat); nay ^ ived at -r that anistan opted a r as the after- visited iat % w, ication ndenee whom tory is aen it ibjects ioitely limits, tar- ion of ppears in this roach- a the akhan ws of prera- ; orer little ession fghan roghll these It is significant that the visit of General Grodekof to Ter me z at the end of September was coincident with that of the Amir to Mazar-r Sharif, and that from about this time a marked improvement is reported to have taken place in the relations of Afghan and Russian frontier officials-. A little time before General Grodekof’s visit four sealed boves were sent from Tashkent to the Governor of Mazar-i-Sharif, between whom and the Governor of Termez a regular weekly correspondence is said to be maintained. An event of importance in October was the arrival on the 31st at Tashkent of eight Afghans w r ho are said to he high officials ; they were at all events of sufficient rank to be made the guests of the Governor-General and to he attended by an escort of four Cossacks. In the middle of the same month it was reported that a considerable impulse had been given to the trade with Afghanistan at Pandjeh where sheep, wool and carpets were being bought in large quantities by the Afghans, and about the same time Patta Kesar was put on the same footing as Kerki and Kilif as regards the exemption from excise duties of Russian manufactures exported to Afghanistan. A report from Patta Kesar announced the arrival at that place on the 22nd Kovember of an Afghan official, Mirza Abdul Aziz, with his family. He had sought refuge in Russian territory owing to his misappropriation of rupees 50,000 from the Afghan Government. A report from the same place but from another source stated that in mid- December Mahomed Sarwan Khan, Wazir of the Governor-General of Balkh, had sought refuge at Patta Kesar owing to defalcations of his accounts. He was said to have at first withstood the overtures of the Russian officials in. the hope that he could effect his return to Afghanistan; but that later he was be coming more friendly with them. The negotiations, initiated in August 1906 for the settlement of the Angio-Russian mutual relations of Great Britain and Russia in Persia, Afghanistan and Reiatious. Tibet, w r ere brought to a conclusion on the 31st August by the signature of a convention at St. Petersburg. As to murids of the Aga Khan see above, t( Russo-Afghan Relations. 5 * A rumour was current in the early half of the year that the Amir of Russo-Bokha- Bokhara, as the result of his visit of the previous year to St. Petersburg, ran Relati0QS - had been given extended powers of administration. Subsequent enquiries, however, show that there is no truth in this rumour. On the other hand, it would appear from a report made in July that Russia is taking a mote active share than formerly in the government of Bokhara and that disputes between Bokhariots and Russians have been removed from the purview of the native courts and are to be settled in future by the Russian Resident at New Bokhara. Mir Ahmarl (or Alam), son of the late Amir of Bokhara, Muzaffar Khan, was sent to Russia to he educated some 32 years ago, when he was about 10 years of age. Settling at Vladimir where he had been educated, he married a daughter of a Tartar official and adopted European customs; later he removed his resi dence to Tomsk, whence he was permitted by the Russians to visit Bokhara temporarily on the death ol his father, in spite of the opposition of the present Amir. He was shortly afterwards deported on suspicion of intriguing against his brother. About the end of 1906 he petitioned to he allowed to return, but the Amir refused his assent. While these negotiations were in progress, the Amir fell ill and the opportunity was utilized by the Russian Government to send Mir Ahmad with his wife to enquire after the state of his brother’s health. Mir Ahmad took up his residence at Charbagh and expected, with the Russians’ support, to he able to settle permanently in Bokhara; but according to a report of early December, he was recalled to Miskab by the Russian authori ties. Apparently he did not meet the Amir, hut corresponded with him1 4 tlirouc'h Said Alam, Hakim of Karstli and son of tlie Amir. He gave much offence to the Kazis of Bokhara by his persistence in wearing European Cos- tume. By an Imperial Order of the 5th Novemher the chief town of the Ferghana District, New Marghelan, has been renamed “ Skohelef \ No confirmation has been received of the reports, given on page 10 of the 1906 Summary, that Turkistan was to be transferred from the W ar to the Home Ministry, and that new regulations were being drafted lor the Govern ment of Trans-Caspia. Indications of the financial difficulties under which Bussia is^ at present labourin 0, are afforded by the contemplated increase of the land tax in Turkistan by a suyyi per jnub^ which is estimated at Bs. 2 to 2-8 pei acre, and by the rumoured calling-in of gold and the substitution of paper which were reported to he taking place in October. In this conneetion it is to be noted that the Bussian budget for 1908 shows an estimated deficit of nearly £20,000,000. The wide-spread, armed revolts of the army and civilian population, which occurred at the end of 1905 and in the middle of 1906, have not been repeated during the past year. In their place the revolutionaries have substituted a system of assassination and robbery. Measured by the large number of victims amongst officials, by the small number of arrests that have been made, by the constant interruptions to traffic on the Central Asian Bailway, in spite of the elaborate precautions taken to prevent them, by the distrust in the loyalty of the railway troops and apparently, too, of the regular portion of the Tashke nt garrison, and by the large sums of money which have been taken from trains, hanks and treasuries, this system has proved more successful than the former methods. How secretly and efficiently the revolutionary organization works may be seen from the list, given below, of some of the more serious outrages during the year. During the first 5 months of 1907 the authorities appear to have taken a hopeful view, so much so that the troops were largely withdrawn from the police duties with which they had been burdened during the preced ing 18 months and their training was taken up with great energy. But with the dissolution of the 2nd Duma, the disfranchisement of Turkistan, and the visit of the Minister of Communications who refused to meet the railway employes* demands, disorders became frequent, extraordinary measures of pre caution were taken by the authorities, and the corps manoeuvres of the two army corps had to he cancelled. The following list of murders, robberies and other disorders does not include those in 'which soldiers only were concerned ; these will be found below under “ Army ” :— 21 - 12-06 22 - 12-06 25-12-06 8-1-07 12-1-07 10-1-07 11-1-07 23-1-07 28-1-07 6-2-07 ...

In October it was reported that some Turkomans had been asked to remove from a tract of ground close to Merv where the Governor of Trans Caspia pro posed to establish a Russian colony; possibly the site is intended for 150 peasants from Astrakhan who arrived in that month at Krasnovodsk, or for the labourers who reached this port about the same time and were apparently to be employed on the construction works at Bairam Ali which were subsequently abandoned. Army. The reports of movements of troops to and from Russian Turkistan show a Variatxns in the nett decrease of 3,933 men, but it is probable that either no decrease has taken ^ rklstan Gam ' place or that the difference is due to the non-arrival of recruits who were still coming from Russia in the first 2 months of 1908. Reports have been received from time to time throughout the year of an actual or intended increase of the forces in the Turkistan district. For example in March it was stated that 2 European battalions were expected at Termez, and in the following month Samarkand was given as the destination of 2 battalions from the Oxus. No such movements, however, appear to have taken place, but in November it was commonly stated in Samarkand that 4 new battalions were to arrive shortly, while in September a report was received at Kashgar that barracks were being built for 4 new battalions that had arrived at Tashkent. This latter rumour was probably founded on the return of some of the infantry of the garrison from the summer camps in August and the increase of the Cossacks to 1,500 in that and the previous month. But in view of the constant disorders in this town and the doubtful loyalty of the garrison, except the Cossacks, vide page 8, it may be that some reinforcement of the garrison is contemplated. A few increases, too, have actually taken place. Those which are con nected with the state of affairs in Persia are detailed below; the arrival of 2 Squadrons of what appear to he either the 1st Astrakhan or Caucasian Cossacks is, apparently, due to the disordered state of the country; and two units at Termez have had additions to their strength. As regards Termez, it was reported in February that an increase of the pontoon company from a peace establishment of 275 to a battalion, of 2 com panies of 450 fas compared with 275 in other battalions) was in contemplation; from information dated mid-October this increase appears to have taken place. During the first 6 months of the year frequent reports, too, were received of the increase of the fortress artillery at Termez and of the arrival from time to time of heavy siege guns, totalling 18 in ail. It was suggested that the new Q. I\ guns had been mistaken for siege guns. A report of November, however, reasserts the presence at Termez of 110 siege guns of which 3 arerm tl,p mraupfs of (he fort and the remainder, including some of pH- pattern, are in store inside it. It will be remembered that Hittich recommended that the Caucasian siege park should be transferred to Central Asia, in order that the fortress of Debdadi might be captured at the outset of operations in Afghanis tan A report from Tennez of October also states that the fortress artil lery has been increased to 600 men; the establishment of the lermez fortress company, it may be noted, is 226 of all ranks The November report adds that there are 80 Q. F. guns at Termez, (where there are only ^ batteries, requirin'* 14 guns in all), and 40 machine guns which would give 8 to each of the 4 battalions at this station. In December 6 machine guns were despatched from Samarkand to Termez, where a further increase of heavy guns and their ammunition was said to have taken place by the middle of the same month. As regards what appears to he the reinforcement of the 1st Astrakhan Cossacks, on the 15th August 400 Cossacks, fully equipped, with their horses, arrived at TCrasnovoclsk from Astrakhan, as was later ascertained, and left on the next 2 davs by the Central Asian Fail way. These Cossacks are described locally as Sunnis and Lf sghians, but from, their uniform they appear to be Astrakhan Cossacks, and it may he that owing to the prevalence of cholera at Astrakhan the 2 sotnias of the 1st Astrakhan Cossacks, which are normally stationed in that town, have been temporarily transferred to Central Asia, where there are already the 2 other sotnias of that regiment, and where the new arrivals cm he employed both against Shia Muhammadans and the Russian revolutionaries. Tliis assumption finds some support in the report of the arrival of 150 peasants from Astrakhan, in October, vide page 7. The 400 men have been split up between the garrisons of Merv, Charjui, Kushk, Pul-i-Khatun and, perhaps, Panjdeh and Askhabad. A troop also proceeded in mid-November to lasbkent where they possibly joined the remaining 2 sotnias of the regiment, which had been transferred to that town from their normal station of Petro- Alexandrovsk in July. - - ' Other movements, with the object of suppressing disturbances, have been as follows:— In July with the 1st Astrakhan Cossacks also came 2 sotnias of the 2nd Ural Cossacks from Samarkand to Tashkent where they still are. In September 2 companies of the 6th Rifle Battalion left Samarkand ; of these one has been ported as guard to the Tashkent Station where apparently the local infantry could not he trusted. The other company appears to have proceeded to the Andijan branch in relief of 350 men of the Zerabulak Reserve Battalion which had been sent to this neighbourhood in August and returned at the end of September to Samarkand. By the middle of the following month 300 men of the 6th Battalion had been detached from Samarkand to Khojent and 200 to Chernayevo, in addition to 400-500 of the 2nd Trans-Caspian Railway Battalion who had been sent at intervals since July to New Marghelan, now called Skobelef, to replace railway men who had gone on strike. I he railway troops detached from Samarkand have been partly replaced by the 1st Trans-Caspian Railway Battalion. 0 K er hk hanses ' • At tbe be § innin o of tlie y° nr ^ ™ reported that new barracks had been built outsiue the fortress at Ivu^hk and in April that large consignments of hiicks had been sent there from Merv for further extensions that were contem plated. Hiese measures^ are, apparently, a continuation of the policy of the previous year of ^ providing the garrison with more spacious and sanitary quarters and on higher sites than the old ones. The new sites are more scat tered, with the result that the supply of water to them by carts has been found unsatisfactory. Consequently a steam-pump and appurtenances, which were landed at Krasnovodsk in October and left early in December in 3 trucks appear to he intended, as rumour says, for the Kushk fortress. Two barracks for Cossacks were being erected on the Imperial Estates at Bairam A i in June ; according to a subsequent report the exact site is Alam r Iapa, 3 miles from Yulatan. Travellers arriving in India from Central Asia in July reported that the er i garrison lad been reduced to a few infantry who, apparently, also Bairam Alisupplied a detachment to Kilif. Some colour is lent to this report by the presence of portions of the 19th and 20th Turkistan Rifle BattaUons, which are normally stationed at Kerk, during the last four months of the year at Charjui, the reinforcement of the frontier guard posts along the Oxus the increase o the Termez Fortress Artillery and the exacted arfiyal of add' tional infantry at Samarkand. But a report of the 1st December shows that the Kerki garrison has been strengthened rather than weakened for on that date it consisted of the 2 rifle battalions mentioned above, the 4th Orenburg Cossacks, the 3rd (? oth) Mountain Battery and some fortress Artillerymen, all of whom form the normal garrison, and in addition of one Q. F. Field Battery. This report added that there were at least 5 heavy guns and 10 heavy mortars m the fort, and that 100 men were detached to Bosaga. A report from another source of the 28th December stated that, owing to Busso-Afghan disputes, the garnson of Kerki was being reinforced by 200 men of the 5th Trans-Caspian lime Battalion and other troops. ^ At Sarai, a crossing of the Oxus between Eastern Bokhara and Badakh* Sftrai or shan about 120 miles above Termez, the Russians have had only a frontier guard post up to 1907. But 2 independent reports of the middle of that year stated that quarters for regular troops were being built there and one of them added that in July 80 infantry and 26 Cossacks left Termez for Sarai in 8 large and several small boats, and had orders to reconnoitre the river en voutc* Two repoits of the end of the year confirmed the above information, one stat« mg that large reinforcements had arrived. It is probable that Sarai, which is reputed to have a good climate and supplies in fair quantities, is being made a sanatorium for Termez where, as elsewhere stated, much sickness has prevailed during the past year. In March it was reported that along the frontier from Sarakhs to Pul-i- F «&gt;ntier Khatun there were 25 frontier guardsmen and 10 buildings at each of the Posts, following places :-~-Daulatabad, Naurozabad, Sangar and Ayak, as also at Bobat; the latter is probably identical with Robat-i-Aulak, not far from Ful-i-Khatun on the Afghan frontier, where a new post was established in September 1906, when it was said to consist of 25 Cossacks and 15 of the frontier guard. In August the Trans-Caspian and Amu Darya Frontier Guard Brigades were inspected by Lieutenant-General A. I. Kolyenkin, one of the two Assistants to the Chief of the Frontier Guard Corps, who is said to have proposed several changes in the distribution of both brigades. Frequent reports have been received in confirmation of the news that the posts along the Oxus have been strengthened, vide ' The Bokharan Army ” on page 11. One report of November states that all posts from Murghahi to Shighnan, as far as Sarai, had been increased, and on arrival in Peshawar in December from Khanahad reported the reinforcement of the Oxus posts, in cluding what appear to be Takhta Kuva, below Sarai, and a post opposite Yang-i-Kala higher up the river. The news, under the preceding heading, of the strengthening of the posts p °st» &lt; between Shighnan and Murghabi confirms information received earlier in thea^T in he year. According to reports of the middle of 1907 Murghabi had been put in a Turkistan. proper state of repair, and a new well had been opened up and connected with the post by a channel, 200 yards in length. In June the Russians were said to be building a new post opposite Ishkashim, and in October it was added that this post had a garrison of 20 men. In the last named month, too, it was stated that a fort, 60 yards square, had been completed at Panja (probably Zung on the opposite or Russian bank of the Panja) and that a road had been con structed thence to Sarhad (on the Wakhan). In August the Kikhin (Langar-i- Kikhin or Kikn) post had been rebuilt and enlarged, and a road from it to Kharukh (Kharigb) was under construction. In December further reports stated that a cart-road was under construc tion from Shighnan to Kikhin, and that the Russians were busily engaged in making roads throughout Wakhan, Shighnan and Gharan (Milvaj).10 tan throughout the*year a.nri +n iia.vft beftn aDDrosimately as follows .

A report from a traveller over the Tashkent Eailway in August gives the tent Railway. following troops on it at that time :— Orenburg, 1,000 men of the 241st Orsk reserve Battalion, Kazalinsk, 30 men of the 2nd Turkistan Rifle Battalion, Ak Masjid, 50 men of the 2nd Turkistan Rifle Battalion and 20 artillery men with 2 guns, and Turkistan, 40 of the 1st Turkistan Rifle Battalion and 30 artillerymen with 3 guns. Manceimes and As already stated, the contemplated manoeuvres of the 1st and 2nd Army ramtng. Corps were prevented by the disturbed state of the country, which also ham* pered the training of the troops and especially that of the Cossacks. Training appears to have been mainly confined to the ordinary summer camps at Troit- skoye, near Tashkent, Piryuza near Askhabad, Samarkand and Termez. The camps at the first 2 places were opened as usual about the middle of May and closed at the end of September. Early in June the Samarkand garrison, except the fortress company, joined the Tashkent troops at Troitskoye but appear to have returned to their own station soon afterwards, for manoeuvres took place near it during the last 10 days of August. At Troitskoye the training was concluded at the end of September by a fortnight’s manoeuvres which included2 days’ practice in mountain warfare. A noteworthy feature, owing to the disor ders, was the almost complete absence of the Cossacks from these manoeuvres in which 6 infantry battalions, 1 sotnia, 14 mountain and 12 field guns, and 2 sapper and 2 telegraph companies took part. Considerable activity, possibly due to the desire to keep the regular troops free from revolutionary influences, was noticeable in the training of the Tash kent garrison during December when, in spite of the inclement weather, units were sent out for manoeuvres for some days at a time with transport and tents. The Inspector-General of Infantry, General Adjutant Zarubayef, in spected the infantry at Tashkent, Samarkand, Charjui, Askhabad, and presum- ably Merv, in J one. Trom Central Asian papers it would seem that the Russians are desirous The Bokharan of taking steps to improve the Bokharan army whose inefficiency was the rmy - subject of an article in the Razvyedchik of 1906,. of which a precis is given in the 1906 Summary. Their offer, however, to supply Russian officers to train this army was rejected at the beginning of the year. In 1906 information was received that arrangements had been made by which the frontier posts along the Oxus were to be handed over to Bokharan troops on mobilizatioa. According to a report of June 1907 steps have now been taken to strengthen these posts in peace by 25 Bokharan infantry. General of Infantry N. I. Grodekof, the new Governor-General of Russian Appointments. Turkistan, arrived in Tashkent on the 16th January. At the end of November the Turkistan papers stated that a rumour was current in St. Petersburg that General Grodekof was to be succeeded by General Kuropatkin. In April it was rumoured that Lieutenant-General P. A. Kartsef had been suspended from the command of the 2nd Turkistan Army Corps owing to his weakness in dealing with the strikers at Krasnovodsk, vide Caspian Sea strike on page 5 but in June he was back at his post. Rumours were frequent throughout the latter half of the year that he was leaving Trans-Caspia, but it was’not till the end of December that he resigned. He has been succeeded by Lieutenant-General V. P. Tikhmenef, General Staff, who was then Chief of the Staff of the Omsk Military District. The new commander has no war service. He was on the Staff of the Semirechya District from 1881 to 1890 and of the 1st Turkistan Army Corps from 1899 to 1905, and then commanded divisions in the Caucasus until January 1907. In February Major-General Kondratovich was transferred from Trans- Caspia to the staff of the Governor-General. On the 14th July Lieutenant-General Shpitzberg retired from the com mand of the 1st Turkistan Army Corps which he took up in November 1906, and was succeeded by Lieutenant-General P. A. Kozlovski who was^ then in command of the 5th Cavalry Division and has no previous Asiatic service. At the end of August Major-General V. 1. Pokotelo was transferred to the appointment of Governor of Ferghana from the same post in Semirechya, where he was temporarily succeeded by Colonel V. N. Susanin, the commander of the Amu-Darya Sub-division. About the same time Major-General Prasalef, the governor of the fortress of Kushk, was promoted to Lieutenant-General, and was replaced by Major- General I. S. Merkhushef, then on the Governor-General’s Staff. In August Nasir Tura, grandson of the Khan of Khiva, was given a lieutenancy in the Russian Army. In December Major-General S. D. Gesket of the General Staff died and was succeeded in the military governorship of the Samarkand District by Major-General A. S. Galkin, General Staff, who was holding the similar post in the Semipalatinsk Province. Major-General Galkin has been continuously on the Staff since 1884, and since 1888 has been employed entirely in Central Asia, except from August 1893 to June 1896, when he was in the Asiatic Division of the Head-quarters Staff.; On page 23 of the 1906 Summary mention was made of some 200 men 5 awaiting trial on account of the mutinies in the latter half of that year. Of these men 86 who belonged to the Turkistan and Trans-Caspian Sapper Bat talions and the 2nd Trans-Caspian Bailway Battalion were found guilty by a court martial which sat at Tashkent at the end of December 1906, while about the same time of 42 men of the Andijan Beserve Battalion 4 were sentenced to exile for life, 2 to a disciplinary battalion, 24 were reprimanded and the remainder acquitted. As already stated, no armed mutinies on any scale have occurred durin» 1907, but throughout the last half of the year much uneasiness appears to have been felt by the authorities as to the state of the troops, other than the Cos sacks, especially in Tashkent. Possibly the distrust of the troops is due to the discovery in July of certain papers of the Askhabad B evolutionary Com mittee ; from these it appears that the Central Asian Bailway was to ini tiate in the autumn a general railway strike which was also to be the signal for arrest by the disaffected troops of all officers who were not in sympathy with them in the Turkistan District. These papers added that the Tashkent garrison could be more particularly trusted to join the contemplated rising and that in Askhabad and Merv the only troops who would not join were the Cossacks, Prontier Guard and a few small regular units. A significant comment on the state of discipline is furnished by a district order which animadverts on the negligence of escorts and the frequent escape of prisoners from their charge. This order of the 31st October was followed by a corps order of the 14th Nov ember issued by the new commander of the 1st Turkistan Army Corps who directed attention to the slackness of guards and sentries and the constant Mure of men to salute the corps commander. It would appear, too, that the * efficiency of many units is far from what it should be, for in September Wnon rnp f-rn’t7'OT , nr»T*.r^pnor*ol -J-M i-l, „ J. - l r't . . _ i 28th December 1906.—-Eight machine-guns were stolen from Tashkent, hnr, Wpvp rmi A Q ^^tr •I- •. v, ere leeuverea. 28th March 1907.—Eight Bussian soldiers broke into13 8th September 1907.—At Tashkent an officer and 2 soldiers were found guilty of having sold rifles and ammunition to civilians. 28th September^ 1907 .—At Charjui some of tbe men of the 17th Turkistan Rifles were concerned in a riot. 14th December 3907.—At Charjui a fracas occurred in tbe barracks of the last-named battalion, and several of the men were wounded. According to information received from St. Petersburg, which is confirmed Armament * by local reports, the whole of the field (except the reserve P) artillery of the 2 Turkistan Army Corps has been rearmed with the new Q. P. gun; the Turkistan Horse Mountain Battery was rearmed with the new Q. F. mountain gun in ^ 1905, and now the mountain battery in each of the artillery brigades has received the same pattern gun. As the result of rearmament the 1st Battery of the 2nd Turkistan Artillery Brigade has, it is reported, ceased to be a heavy battery, and the 3rd Battery which was at Kerki has been replaced by the 5th Mountain Battery. It is to be presumed that the 1st and 2nd batteries of the 1st brigade have also become light batteries. From the subjoined reports it appears that a new rifle and ammunition are being taken into use in Central Asia. Possibly the re-armament only applies to the gendarmerie, or to the new force of railway guards referred to on page 8, for, according to an Army Order of 1907, the whole of the gendar merie is being re-armed with Colonel Yurlof’s rifle, of which no details are known except that it is of the normal calibre of 3 lines or The following are the reports :— (a) Tashkent, 21st September 1907, two wagon-loads of a new pattern rifle, without bands, arrived by the Tashkent railway; (5) 200 Caucasian Cossacks landed at Krasnovodsk with what were locally said to be rifles of a new pattern, but they could not bo seen as they were in leather cases; (c) Merv, 3rd November 1907, 2 wagon-loads of a new pattern rifle ammunition arrived from west; (d) Samarkand, 9th October 1907, a new kind of ammunition has arrived; the cartridge is the same size as the old pattern, but the bullet hardly projects from the case, as the charge is more concentrated. Owing to the dependence of Turkistan on other countries for supplies of Supplies, corn and forage, vide page 28, it was decided in 1106 to establish magazines of non-perishable supplies or of those which could be easily turned over. The collection of these supplies, according to a report that requires confirmation, was accompanied in 1907 by a rise in the price of food-grains which led to serious complaints from the natives, with the result that the purchase was stopped about the middle of the year. It is significant that in the latter half of the year considerable purchases of wheat, barley and lucerne were made at Sarakhs apparently from Persian territory. Some activity appears to have been displayed in the registration of Horses, etc, and transport during the year, for example, in March the Turkomans in the Trans P ort * Turkistan District were directed to be ready to produce on mobilization 17,000 camels, and in October 4,COO horses and 2,000 camels were registered in the Patta Kesar division. At the end of December local papers announced that in 1908 a gov ernment stud of 100 horses would be established at Auliatia. Samarkand would appear to be a market for horses, for in December a remount committee from Fatta Kesar was buying 10 horses a day at that town. In the course of the year new regulations and establishments were issued for the regimental and divisional transport in European Russia and the Caucasus. Commenting on the changes involved thereby, the official Russki14 alid remarked that the experiences of the war in Mancharia, where ■ L , t • or I'nncr ntjo n.irnrri «esor»a fr&gt;» #» (a) 6th May 1907. 480 carts passed through Tashkent southwards from Orenburg; (5) 15th to 25th May 1907. 500 carts, probably inclusive of those V ^ under («), arrived at Merv from the east and 300 from the west; 400 were sent to Kushk ; 16th October 1907. 40 carts passed through Tashkent southwards; 19th October 1907. Samarkand has a reserve of 200, or 50 per battalion, of the new carts, but there are none at Askhabad, and it would appear that at Patta Kesar each battalion may have 8 of them, but that there is practically no reserve. According to 2 independent sources, these carts are 1-horsed, 2-wheeled, painted dark-green and provided with a tarpaulin ; they have strong low wheels, similar to those of the ammunition carts, and a splay behind; their regulation load is 7i0 lbs. which it may be noted, is that prescribed some 25 years ago for the load of the local 1-horsed, 2-wheeled arba; they can carry 4 wounded men sittin 01 or 2 lying-down; they are strongly built, as iron enters largely into their construction; a railway truck on the Central Asian Railway carries 10 of them, and on the Siberian Railway 20. Comparing the number of old and new vehicles available in certain cases with the scales°of transport that have recently been authorised for the Caucasian troops and with those adopted in Manchuria, it seems that the scale to which the Central Asian authorities are working is a total of 93 vehicles per battalion, of which 35 would he allotted to regimental transport, viz 6 ammunition carts, 2 carts for medical stores, 4 as ambulances, and 19 for baggage, and four 2-horsed kitchens, while 6 ammunition carts and 52 carts for baggage and supplies would be available for divisional transport and ammuni tion units. Reports were current at the beginning of the year that liability to com pulsory service was to be extended to the native population of Turkistan, but they lack confirmation. In 1906 Tashkent town supplied 166 recruits to the Russian Army; presumably, in accordance with the usual practice, they were sent to other districts to serve. From Semirechya in the same year 1,029 youths reached the age for military service; of these 395 were enlisted, all being Christians, except 33 Mussulmans, 5 infidels and 1 Jew who deserted. 260 of these recruits were sent to Kharkof and Petrovsk in European Russia.

Of this course Colonel Yagello is the director, and until the end of 1906 the chief instructor in Hindustani was a British-Indian subject, kbalil-ud-Din, wdio, after a three years* residence in Turkistan w T here he received a Russian decoration, returned to India about the middle of 1907 via Meshed and fceistan. The regulations for the course in Oriental languages underwent 2 alterations during the year, viz., (a) military statistics and the history of Turkistan and neighbouring countries and Muhammadan law are to be subjects of the course in future; and (6) the number of officers attending was raised from mid-October when the new class joined to 20, for one officer is'to be detailed from each of the rifle, reserve infantry, Artillery, Sapper and Cossack brigades, one from the 1st Turkistan Cossack Division, and one from the 2 reserve batteries. Oriental Fifteen officers of tlm Turkistan District passed through the 2-years* courseagainst Persia and Turkey. The first intimation that Russia considered that the internal state of R p r s e 1 p a f a uons ar7 Persia and the aggression of the Turks in Azarbaijan might necessitate military action on her part is contained in a despatch from Sir A. Mcolson, No. 49 of the 25th March, which communicated a memorandum from the Russian Foreign Minister to the effect that, if necessary for the security of the service of the Russian loans, Astara, Julfa, Enzell, Meshed-i-Ser and Bandar Gaz would he occupied by troops who were to be held in readiness. Sub- seauent information showed that, for the double purpose of meeting this contingency and of dealing with the strike that had broken out a few days before amongst the S. S. employes on the Caspian Sea, reinforcements were despatched almost at once to the Caucasus, where, owing to the prevalent disorders, it would apparently be necessary to replace wholly or partially any troops that might be withdrawn from it.

As regards movements of Russian troops towards the frontier between the Caucasus and Persia it was ascertained in June by a British officer, whose re- port of the Erivan-Julfa Railway is given on page 4a, that there were then no indications of any large barracks or camps at J ulfa where the only tr«» P s were 2-3 Kuban Cossacks and a few men ot the Frontier Guard and of the 5th Caucasian Rifles, while not more than 140 of the 2nd Kuban Cossacks were seen along the railway. In the middle of August the Consul at Batum stated that the 1st and 2nd Caucasian Rifle Brigades were being held in readiness to start for Persia although the interest on the Russian loans had been duly paid. But about this time the Erench Consul at Tiflis reported that no preparations were being m^de beyond the detachment of some troops from Erivan to he frontier This S item was confirmed by our Consul-General ^Tabriz who added that the increase on the frontier was confined to Khuda Afram, east of Julia, but, cording to him, troops were being collected at Kars. In consequence of these reports special enquiries were made in September and December, and from these it appears that the Caucasus garrisons have been increased as follows :— (a) Elizavetpol, 1 battalion ; (&amp;) Tiflis, 2 regular battalions, 1 Kuban Plastun Battalion, 3 field bat teries and 3 Cossack Regiments ; (c) Alexandropol, 2-3 battalions and 3 Cossack Regiments; (d) Eriran, 1-2 battalions ; and (e) Balajari, 2 field batteries.16 Apparently this increase of troops has been rendered possible partly by the arrival of the reserve units given above and by the withdrawal of outlying units and has also enabled the movements from Baku, detailed below, to be carried out. The reports last quoted gave the garrison of Julfa in December as a few frontier guardsmen and a company of the 8th Caucasian rifles from Tiflis. But according to the Bazvyedchik there were 6 sotnias of the Uman Cossacks at Julfa at the end of the year, and this was the only increase of Russian garrisons on that frontier. On the other hand at that time it was reported from Meshed that, had not the Shah yielded to the popular demands, a demonstration would have been made from the Caucasus and Resht by a force of four infantry battalions some mountain artillery, machine-guns and Cossacks. And a few days later it was added from the same source that a force of this strength was ready to operate against Tabriz and bodies, not exceeding 2,000 men each, against Resht Astarabad and Meshed. * No reinforcement of the Russian troops in Northern Persia appears to have taken place beyond (a) a considerable increase of the Meshed Consular Guard m October, when too some 51 boxes of ammunition, ( ? 18,200 rounds S A A 1 armed at that town, and (l) an addition of 25 men to the Consular Guard at rw 1Z alarm llad 1)6611 caused by a design against the Consul- thaTtown * fe ^ themurder of 3 Russian postal couriers between Urmia and Tbe movements of Russian troops and stores from Baku, Petrovsk and l/oThare been aslolLsT-' 311 Md CMkishl y ar ° id the Cas P^ Sea during Ntjmbee of Pate. 18th April 22nd April ,, 18th May 27th August »„ 28th April ,,, 8th May 18th May 13th September 28th May ,,, 27th August 18th August 21st October Regiment. 38f 39 Sailors Caucasian Grenadier 39 151+ 153 213 14 Grenadiers 154 Lenkoran Local Pet.

A battery of the 21st Arti’lery Brigade, w hich is quartered in the Caucasus, appears also to have been added to the Baku garrison. Chikishlyar, in the south-western corner of Trans-Caspia on the Caspian Sea, would appear to have been provided with a regular garrison, which it normally does not have, of 2,460 infantry and 12 machine guns. Stores and supplies were also accumulated here towards the end of 1907, and by the middle of January 1908 there were in reserve, under a Turkoman guard, 150 boxes of rifles, 350,000 rounds S.A.A- and 3,000 bags of flour. There is, how ever, reason to believe that a portion of the above force has been removed from Chikishlyar, possibly to Astara for no regular troops w r ere seen at Chikishlyar in the middle of January 1908 by a traveller whose observations were confined to the immediate vicinity of this town. It is possible that the troops may have been moved inland, e.g., to the neighbourhood of the new bridge over the Atrek, tide page 26. The supposition that some of the Chikishlyar garrison proceeded to Astara is confirmed by news from Tehran, dated the 15th August, that the local de- tachment of CO men had been increased to 2,COO with some field guns. Since18 that date 150 men and 12 horsed maxims have been added, according to the foregoing table, and it is also possible that the reinforcements which raised the Lenkoran garrison from 150 to 1,350 men have proceeded southwards to Astara where, according to Hussian residents of Krasnovodsk, 5,000 troops, with large quantities of warlike stores and supplies, had been collected by the end of December. Details are given on page 26 of the reinforcement of the Caspian Sea Plotilla by 2 torpedo*boat destroyers which may be followed by 3 more. The frequent visit of these and other Russian vessels to Chikishlyar, Astarabad and other Caspian ports are said to have led to remonstrances from Persia during December. As regards the preparations for a demonstration against Meshed it was probably in connection therewith that the Russian Military Attache was engaged in July in examining the routes thence to Doshak, Sarakhs via the Mazandaran Pass, and Pul-i-Khatun via the Kashaf Rud. The same officer gave in October the following information of the Russian plan for the occupation of Meshed in case of a rising against the Shah in that town The Pul-i-Khatun Cossack sotnia would reach Meshed in 4 days; if necessary, it would proceed to Turbat-i-Haidari, being relieved at Meshed by another sotnia. Prom Sarakhs would march half of the infantry battalion, i.e., the 5th Trans-Caspian Rifles, with machine-guns, and moving via, the Mazandaran Pass with camel transport, would reach Meshed in 6 days. In the same time, or at most one day longer would arrive at Meshed from Askh- abad another half-battalion, with its baggage, on four guns, two Cossack sotnias and two field guns ; this force would be able to act as a movable column from Meshed. It was probably in anticipation of some such move as the above that the post of 25 frontier guardsmen at Pul-i-Khatun was reinforced by 70 Cossacks in April, by 30 more in June, 50 in August and 60 in October, i.e., a total of 210, and that, as stated elsewhere, considerable supplies of forage were being sent to the same place in the latter half of the year. Sarakhs,°which usually has no Cossacks was strengthened by a sotnia in the middle of the year and by a second, making 200 Cossacks in all, at the end of October. At this time too, there were 100 railway troops and 10 Cossacks at Teien. At the end of the year the forces at these 3 stations were :— at Pul-i-Khatun—220 Cossacks (normally 100) and 20 of the hospital corps; r at Sarakhs the 5th Trans-Caspian rifles of 800 rank and file and 80 Cossacks (normally none) ; at Tejen—200 men of the 1st Trans-Caspian Railway Battalion and a machine-gun company of 200 men. The deerease in the strength of the Cossacks since October may be due to the annual movements of reservists and recruits. ^ the BnsSrnnr ? ber *i esbe . d that therfi was S°°d reason to believe heen^eot tn Kt?

This accident was due to the floods which had breached the line badly in several places and necessitated the laying 1 of temporary rails which were met! until the end of April when the permanent repairs appear to have been completed. The section of the line from Juma to Tashkent especially suffered at this time, and more particularly the portion lying between Lomakino and Chernayevoj the Eokhara- Juma section was also damaged by these floods. 16-S-07 m.

It appears that this is no isolated experience near Tejen, and that steps have now been taken to prevent a recurrence of these interrup tions, for a company of the 1st Trans-Caspian Railway Battalion was employed here from Jure to mid October, when it was to he relieved by 100 men of the Kushk Railway Company, 21-6-07 ...

The arrival of the Minister of Communications coincided with numerous attempts to destroy the line by bombs between Askbabad and Merv; at the latter town, too, an effort was made to destroy the railway bridge. 27- 7-07 A collision occurred at Archman near Kizil Arvat owing to 4 miles of the line having been washed away, and it was not till the 30th that through communication with Asknabad could he established. The number of killed and wounded is variously given between 15 and 36. There is reason to believe that the occurrence was not entirely due to the state of the line, but was brought about by disaffected railway- men, for it is significant that a band of robbers soon appeared on the scene and deprived the passengers of their belongings, and that shortly afterwards 65 of the Kizil Arvat railway employes were dismissed, 26- 8*07 ...

Improvements .—In the first quarter of the year, when extensive repairs were necessitated on the Saraarkand-Tashkent section of the line, it appears that the occasion was utilized to insert 2 passing places between each pair of stations on this section, except between Rostovtsevo, Kuropatkino and Milyu- tinskaya, between each pair of which only 1 passing place was provided. These crossing-places are probably of the normal length, i.e. } 5C0 yards in the clear, but one report describes them as being 1,000 yards long. Reports of April to August assert that 1-2 similar passing-places have also been inserted between each pair of stations on the Chernayevo-Andijan Branch, but these reports have been contradicted from another source and further enquiries are necessary before either statement can be accepted. With reference to the report of a Central Asian paper at the end of 1906 that Assake station was to be enlarged, it appears that since then it has been classified as a passing place and provided with the necessary personnel. . ■ J ^ u &amp; us t it was reported that, with a view to preventing the use of exces- sive speeds, e g., 40—45 instead o£ 23 J miles per hour, Westinghouse brakes were to be universally introduced. 6 t0 tl,e ° fficia ! ^ turn of railway engines for 1905, there were the follow mg engines on the mam line and the branches to Kushk and Andijan — Made since lyoo.

It appears from local papers that repairs to engines cannot be effected with sufficient economy in the workshops at Tashkent and Kizil Arvat, for at the end of October engines were being sent to the Kharkof shops in Southern Russia for repair. A noteworthy feature in the latter part of the year was the arrival of large quantities of railway material at Krasnovodsk. Between the 22nd August and the 20th September 8 steamers arrived with rails, sleepers, fish-plates, girders, culverts, and sufficient iron-work for the construction, it was said, of 15 stations. In October and November six more steamers with railway material follow ed, and one of them was reported to have a cargo of 50 truck-loads of rails, sleepers and fish-plates. Of the total amount of this material landed at Krasnovodsk, 83 truck-loads have been sent off east. Of these, 39 have been observed to arrive at Merv, and 6 at Askhabad ; 6 have passed eastwards through Charjui; and several trucks with rails are reported to have been sent from Merv to Kushk on the 10th, six on the 29th October and several on the 5th De cember. It is said that one consignment from Krasnovodsk contained chairs which have not so far been used on the Central Asian or Tashkent lines. It is not known for what purposes these large consignments of material are required. Locally it has been suggested that part is destined for the im provement of the line near Kizil Arvat, and part for the contemplated exten sion of the Firyuza Branch. It is, also, possible that it may be intended for one or more of the following objects :— (а) the rumoured extension of the Tashkent station; (б) the construction of the line from Kokand to Namangan ; (c) the construction of crossing-places on the Merv-Kushk branch, or its prolongation; (d) the construction of aline from Tejen to Pul-i-Khatun, and thence through Persian territory, either southwards towards Khaf, or westwards to Meshed; it was rumoured in February that the con struction of this line had been started but further enquiries ascertained that there was no truth in the statement; and (e) the general repair of the Central Asian line, especially in such places as the neighbourhoods of Tejen and Chernayevo. This last explanation appears to be the most probable, and it is to he noted that local papers announced in June the intention of allotting 70,000 roubles or £ 7,300 to the Central Asian Railway for improvements. From a newspaper statement made in September it seems that the average capacity of Russian trucks is 12 tons. It was added that in future trucks would carry 14 tons, and that on the Southern Railways, in European Russia, 38-ton trucks were under trial. 3. The Firyuza Branch. —This branch-line, of some 15 miles in length, to the summer camp for Askhabad was re-opened to traffic for the year on the 14th May, but it suffered such severe damage from the rains of the middle of that month that until the end of July it could not be used for the conveyance of goods or passengers. It appears to have been worked, as in 1906, by a portion of the Kushk P^ailway Company, and on the I2th October, w 7 hen the line was closed for the winter, 100 men of this company remained, apparently for the purpose of relaying the Ak Tapa-Firyuza section, a distance of 6 miles, on wdiich they had been engaged in the middle of the previous month. The Merv-Kushh Branch .—Rumours of the doubling of this line or of the insertion of crossing-places were somewhat frequent at the beginning of22 the year. They, however, lack confirmation, although, as a result of General Maximovich’s tour of inspection of Central Asia at the end of 1906, some necessary improvements have been made, such as the widening and strengthen ing of embankments and preparations for increasing the siding accommodation at°several of the stations in the form of levelling the ground and storing the necessary material. In the early part of the year a^ new goods-dep6t for the branch line was under construction at Merv, but owing to lack of funds it has not been completed and the buildings are being used as an annexe to the main line goods-station. Ihere is reason to believe that ( 0 ) the rolling-stock has been increased by 4 engines and 20 wagons; and (b) the trains, w hich are shewn in the official Time-Tables as running each way twice a week, actually run daily but are only available for ordinary traffic on 2 days in the w eek. Possibly these measures have been taken in anticipation of the increase of trade between Trans-Caspia and Afghanistan which may follow from the facilities to be afforded thereto by the Anglo-Russian agreement. One of the first consequences of the publication of this agreement w as the appearance in the Russian press of articles urging the connection of the Russian and Indian railway systems by the prolongation of the Merv-Kusbk branch through Afghanistan to Chaman, as suggested in a secret memorandum from the pen of M. Lessar. In this connection it w T as announced by Russian papers at the end of November that a party of engineers from the Moscow- Kursk line had left for Central Asia with a view r to surveying the extension of the Kushk Branch to Herat, but the report appears to be unfounded. 4. The Kokand Namangan Branch.—A reference to the intended construc tion of this branch-line is made in- the 1906 Summary. Since then a conces sion for its construction has been given to Prince Khilkof, and the prospectus of the line lias been issued. It is to be begun in the spring of 1908, will have a length of 57 miles, and is estimated to cost, inclusive of a bridge 1,060 feet long, over the Sir Darya, Rs. 6,047,000, i.e., £636,500, or £11,170 per mile. The nett profit is placed at 7 per cent.* for the line w ill open up the rich cotton district of Namangan, of which only a fifth is at present under cul- th ation. The concession is for 89 years, but Government has the right of pur chase after 25 years at a 5 per cent, capitalization of the annual profits, based m the average of the best 7 years. Local papers also announce the concession to Prince Khilkof, ex-Minister St ^ ie ^ e ? se . 0 ^ some 110 acres of naptha-bearing soil at Maili-Saim the Namangan District, and bis intention to extend the Namangan branch to this concession which lies about 50 miles further to the north-east on the opposite side of the Narin River. 5. Hie Mariagement of the Central Jsian Railway. —No confirmation has been received of the report given in the 1906 Summary, that a part of the Tashkent hue was to he transferred to the Central Asian, but the Minister of '^ e y ntcd ’ during his Visit in July to Askhabad,23 (i|) : d const® nacoft a Mi 111,1 [•Miita id? soil si amanfi (Woi se ofd' the®! ffaitlB tte^ jaia 1J line list tolx‘5 1 ultima 1 In consequence of the frequent attacks on the line and trains by the revolutionaries, a special corps of 1,000 gendarmerie, according to a report of a local paper, dated the 2nd July, was to be raised at a cost of Rs. 255,000 or £27,000; but confirmation of this report has not been received. Probably the rumour is connected with the formation, authorized at the end of 1907, of a Special Volunteer Guard for all Russian railways; for this corps the 1908 Budget provides a sum of £100,000. On the murder of Major-General Ulyanin in June, the management of the Central Asian Railway devolved on Colonel Gesket. The Director of the Central Asian Railway, it may be noted, is ex-officio Commander of the Turkis- tan Railway Brigade {vide A. O. 539 of 19u7). Prom remarks in the “ Novoye Vremya ” on the subject of the visit of the Minister of Communications to the Central Asian Railway it appears that con siderable friction exists between the railway administration on the one hand and the Nadejda, and Kavkaz and Mercury S. S. Companies which ply on the Caspian Sea on the other. The resultant confusion on the railway is accentuated by the alleged duality of control for it is, apparently, in part under the Ministry of Communications, although in 1906 it was decided that it should be under the Ministry of War. In this connection a report, emanating from St. Petersburg and given by the “Trans-Caspian Review ” in its issue of the 30th October, is of interest. It is to the effect that the Department of Military Communications is considering the advisability of disbanding the staff ef the Turkistan Railway Brigade and one of the railway battalions, Confirma tion of this report is to be found in tho statements of local newspapers that the railway battalions are to be withdrawn from the main line and confined to the working of the Merv-Kushk and Firyuza branches. Possibly, too, the recent arrivals of railway navies and the departure of engineers from the Kurs^-Moscow line for Central Asia may be connected with the rumoured disbandment of one of the railway battalions. 1. Interruptions to Traffic .—In the 1903 Summary it is stated on the The Tashkent authority of local papers that the Tashkent Railway was entirely secure from the Rai i w ®y- risk of the Amu Darya floods. The storms of the first 4 months of 1907, however, have shewn that these papers had little foundation for their assertion. At the end of January the “ Novoye Vremya” announced that the line had been washed away for some 16 miles on tbe Perovsk-Turkistan section; a month later the line was reported to be damaged in several places, and the trains for Orenburg were unable to leave Tashkent on tbe 27th February. Further damages were reported in March near Sauran, on the above-mentioned section, where trains were derailed on the 7th and 8th with serious loss of life on the second occa sion. On the 3rd April a train was also derailed at Emba, 288 miles from Orenburg. On tbe 9th and 29th June the Orenburg train did rot arrive at Tashkent owing to floods. Again in December the Sir Darya was so high that the line was in imminent danger of being breached between Berkazan and Solo- Tyube. Further cases of interruption of traffic were :— 26th December 19G6 .—20 miles from Tashkent a train was derailed by robbers who killed 6 passengers. 4(h April 1907 .—An engine was wrecked by marauders. Early August .—A collision occurred some 120 miles from Tashkent, bet ween Kara Kungur and Timor. 20th September 1907 .—A collision at Kazalinsk destroyed 2 engines and 15 carriages. 26th October 1907 .—A train was derailed at Daboya. 7th November 1907 .—13 wagons were damaged by the derailment of a goods train at Aris Station.27th November The mail train from Orenburg was derailed near Buzluk, the line was torn up for a considerable distance, and there were many casualties, but, apparently, none were fatal. In this connection it may be noted that the petroleum reservoir at Turkis- tan Station was partially destroyed by fire on the 25th November. 2. Expenditure .—The 1907 and 1908 Budgets provide under the heading of extraordinary expenditure £184,600 and £133,300 respectively for the Southern, Kubek-Tashkent, section of the line. These sums, apparently, complete the sanctioned expenditure on the line. The original estimate was £6,982,400, but according to local papers it has been reduced in practice to £6,473,700, or £12,440 per mile, as the section is 516 miles in length. It seems, however probable that further expenditure will be necessary, either in diverting or raisin 0 ’ the level of the line in order to prevent a recurrence of the damage between Perovsk and Turkistan. 3. The Tashkent Station .—According to local papers a very considerable extension of this station is in contemplation. At the beginning of October a detailed examination of the approaches to the station were made by the Gover nor-General and his staff, and the arrival of the Director of the line at Tashkent at the end of that month was to be followed by a decision as to the limits of the extension, which involves, it is said, the removal of the sappers’ barracks near the station and the addition of 26 miles of sidines. It is said that the Tashkent Bailway Directorate has asked for a grant of £210,000, but has been given onlv £26,300 for the extension. ^ 4. Rolling-stock .—According to an unofficial source of information the rolling-stock at the end of 1906 consisted of 150 engines, 80 passenger coaches and 1,600 goods wagons. The &lt;c Turkistan News ” announced aUhe end of November that from 1908 the number of passenger trains is to be raised from 2 to 4 pairs per day. 5. Retro-Alexandrovsk Branch.—k. petition was presented in April bv the residents of Petro-Alexandrovsk for the construction of a line from Kazalinsk to that tovn and thence to Khiva ; the petition was accompanied bv a list of those who were willing to subscribe to the cost of the project. The RcstovtsevO' Early in 1907 reports were received of a cable line being under enn !iMe“'y° k Aer “' . strucion , from _ Samarkand to Suck Bulok where a rich discovery of coal had been made Central Asian papers of September gave some details of this line and added that the supports had been completed for two-thirds of the wav and the route taken by the line was practicable for motors. It appears, however! from the “ Gorno-Zavodski Lrstok,” quoted in the Indian Trade Journal that the line strikes off from the Central Asian Railway at Rostovtsevo^Ss east of Samarkand The cableway is 54 miles long, or 24 miles longer than the nert longest in the world. It is being built for the Turkistan Coal and Mining Company of Samarkand on the Gorman double-cable system by the Kh'rkof and Rerun firm of T V. liiclmer. Work was started in July 1900 and will it is hoped, be completed by the spring of 1903.

Connection of the Tashkent and Siberian Hallways. —According to a i n CeatrafAs?* 6 ^ 3 statement, ascribed to the Minister of Communications during his visit to Tashkent, there is no immediate prospect of the construction of the connection between the Tashkent and Siberian Railways. He, however, is said to have promised that eventually a line would be built from Tashkent to Vyerni; it is expected to branch oft from the Tashkent line at Charak or more probably from Aris, 58J and 96| miles respectively from Tashkent. In November it was reported that Engineer Glezer, who has surveys of other lines in Central Asia, vide below, had arrived at Tashkent with a view to making a final survey of the line to Vyerni from Aris. It appears from local newspapers of December that Chimkent will he left to one side by the line unless that town can guarantee some 161,000 tons of traffic annually. 2. Hailways in the Khirgiz Country. —In the same month it was also announced that Prince Kkilkof bad received a concession for the construction of the projected line from Chelyabinsk to Semipalatinsk, via Troitsk, Kustunai and Akmolinsk. This alignment is one of several which have been proposed for opening up to colonization by the surplus peasant population the Kirghiz country which has an area Jrd of that of European Russia, and tracts suitable for cultivation and great mineral wealth in its eastern portion. Alternative projects are as follows :— (a) Uralsk-Orenburg-Orsk*Atbazar-Akmolinsk, 1,160 miles. (*) Aktyubinsk-Turgai-Akmolinsk-Semipalatinsk, 1,180 miles; this alignment was surveyed by Engineer Glezer, and his report appeared in Central Asian papers in August 1907. Owing to the difficulty of the water-supply and the comparative lack of cul- turable soil in its western portion. Glezer suggests that Orenburg, and not Akmolinsk, should be the starting point. (&lt;?) Petropavlovsk-River Chu, 1,000 miles. This third alternative was also surveyed by Glezer who considers that it should receive the most careful survey, for it is a formidable rival to the Taskkent-Vyerni-Semipalatinsk projects for connecting the Central Asian and Siberian Railways. It is the shortest line of connection, has an ample water supply throughout the whole of its length, and is unrivalled in cheapness of construction. Moreover this line, intersecting that which he proposes from Orenburg to Semipalatinsk, would completely open up the Kirghiz country, and, if this latter line were prolonged via Uralsk and Tsaritsin to Novo-Rossisk, the port on the Black Sea, the future of the Khirgiz country would he assured. The Ulukhanlu-Julfa Railway, 117 miles in length, was temporarily opened j to traffic in November 190 , when the Nakhichevan-Julfa section of 281 miles was finished. The line is single, of the usual Russian 5 feet gauge, hut the rails are rather light. Ulukhanlu is on the Alexandropol-Erivan line and 8J miles south of the latter town, has ample platform accommodation for troops, 7-8 sidings and crossing-places, and a small repairing shop for engines. Between the 2 terminal stations are 8 stations and 5 passing-places, at intervals of 4-13 miles ; the station-buildings, which were being built in 1907, will be spacious and of red brick. In the middle of 1907 a train of 12 2nd and 3rd class carriages and 10 goods-wagons, with a small, old-fashioned engine that hums oil, ran 3 times a week each way. The journey takes 12 hours, i.e^ the speed is 9J miles per hour. The line is continued for a short distance beyond Julfa station in the direction of a new, single-span, iron lattice-girder bridge across the Aras. This bridge, though completed by the middle of the year, was not open for traffic, and the wire-hawser ferry was still being used for the conveyance of passengers and goods across the river. The line is to be taken over by Government early in 1908.26 TheCaspianSea On page 32 of the 1906 Summary it was stated that the Russians Flouila ' proposed to strengthen their flotilla on the Caspian Sea where the existing vessels were too slow to deal with smugglers. An increase has since then been made, dictated, perhaps, by the situation in Persia; it consisted of the addition at the end of October of 2 torpedo-boat destroyers, classified as 1st class torpedo boats in a recent order of the Russian Admiralty. These boats, the “Pwilki” and “ Pronzitelni,” have a complement of 54 and 56 respectively, 4 funnels propellers, triple expansion engines, cylindrical Yarrow boilers, a speed of 27 knots, a bunker capacity of 60 tons with a radius of action of 1,400 miles at a 12-knot speed, one 3-inch and three 47 m. m. guns, two 15-inch torpedoes, a search light and a signal mast. It was probably these vessels that were off Krasnovodsk from the 7th ICth December when they left for Astarabad. They were said to have 10 guns each of which 4 appear to be the guns described above and the remainder machine- guns. These 2 boats which are, it is said, to be followed by 3 more, make a valuable addition to the flotilla, which, till their arrival, consisted of 1 transport 1 despatch-boat, and 1 harbour vessel with speeds of 12—15 knots, another harbour vessel of 1882, a gun-boat of 1879, 3 steamers of still older date a survey-ship, a barge, 3 launches and 2 light-ships. Mlr^K P Mar?ne a According to the Russian official return of their Mercantile Marine of the •1st—14th September 1904, the trading fleet of the Caspian Sea then consisted of 225 steam vessels, 40 steam tugs, etc., with a tonnage of 185,600 tons gross • and 118,350 nett, and 544 sailing vessels with a total of 116,202 tons 'Toss and 113.700 nett. Of the steam-vessels one has a speed of 14, 110 of 10—12 and 150 of 6—10 knots an hour. Fifteen steamers, (total of 4,200 nett tons) are for passengers, 60 (22,000 nett tons) for goods-passengers, 23 (7,800 nett tonsl for goods and 130 (81,800 nett tons; for oil. The draft of 50 of the steamers is 1—7 of 68 7—10, and of 144 10-14 feet. The Amu Dar, a . In January a new ford was discovered by the Frontier Guard at Jukash. not far from Patta Kesar.

Bridges.Beum Bash and Kara Tasb in the Chikishlyar sub-district. The bridge was completed by the end of December 1907. In November the wooden bridge across the Sir Darya at Khojentwas closed to traffic, as it had become dangerous owing to old age. This bridge was form erly the only one across the river between Tashkent and Ferghana, but now that a railway bridge crosses the Sir Darya near Chinaz the authorities do m t consider that they should incur the expense of building an iron road bridge, some 190 feet long, at a cost of Rs. 200,000 or £ 21,300, and propose to establish in place of the wooden bridge a flying ferry at Khojent. The Jskhabad-Firyuza Road. —The heavy rains of the middle of May Roads, almost entirely swept away this road, including most of the bridges of which the largest was 85 feet in length. It was hoped to complete the repairs within a month, but the work had not been ended by December. !SkobolevTca —In the hills near this Russian settlement (Askhabad District) was begun in mid November the survey of an alignment for a cart road along the right bank of the Sakiz-Yab stream.

The Osh-Kashgar Road. —In the winter of 1906-1907 a landslip at Komar, on the Osh side of the Terek Davan, interrupted this road, but it was reopened by the middle of January 1907. In the following September it was again reported to be washed away in several places between Osh and Irkishtam. Roads in Wakhan and Shighnan .— Vide Posts on the Pamirs, page 9. In August an unconfirmed report was received that Patta Kesar had been Tele g ra P hs * connected with Kulab (Kulyab) by telegraph. According to a report of the beginning of October the telegraph has not been continued beyond Irkishtam in the direction of Pamirski Post. In April it was reported that Sarakhs and Pul-i-Khatun, 40 miles apart, Heliograph, maintained heliographic communication when the weather permitted. Lieutenant Colonel B B. Russel, R.E., and Mr. Russell, LC.S., proceeding Travels. via Persia from India homewards, were permitted, with the assistance of the Russian Consul-General at Meshed, Mr. Klemm, to visit Samarkand and Bokhara in January and to travel thence by the Central Asia Railway and the Caspian Sea to the Caucasus. At the end of September was reported the arrival at Askhabad from the east of a Japanese General with 2 other Japanese officers. About the same time Lieutenant C. T. Daukes, Foreign Department, and Lieutenant Molesworth were detained at Askhabad by the police owing to their passports not being in order. After 1^ days’ detention Lieutenant Daukes was allowed to proceed on his journey to Persia, but Lieutenant Molesworth did not leave until 3 days later. Commercial. Many unsuccessful attempts have been made in the past to repair the irrigation. Bairam Ali canal. These attempts were renewed in 1907, when, according to some reports, a sum of Rs. 5,00,000 or £53,000 was to be provided for the repair of the Eand-i-Sultan. But after some 350 men had been employed from August to November on the canal and on a tram-line to assist in the repairs all work was abandoned as the result of an inspection by Prince Khilkof who found that the swamps caused by the overflow of the Murghab could not be drained. In September it was reported that work was about to he commenced on a canal which is to water the country between the Amu Da.ya and the Murghab. And in November near Nikola in the Khojent sub-district a new canal was open; it brings some 100,000 acres under cultivation. The Russians were reported in February to be encouraging cultivation Cultivation, generally, and more particularly that of fruit-trees, in Shighnan. The extension of the cultivation of cotton continues both in the Tejen District of Trans-Caspia and in Ferghana. During the year a ginning mill was erected both at Tejen and Kokand, and at the latter place also a cotton-oilf Minerals. Banks. 28 A 4 - nno «mp excellent harvests of cotton were expected throughout S 1 ■ renLlTsia hut ewly frosts at the end of October so-damaged the rip™ cro js thtt a'return of but 510 lbs per acre as compared with 940 lbs ? P im« t ’ wn«'pxTiected Another report places the deficit, as compared with 1905 at 20 per cent in Kokand, 30-40 per cent, (finer fibre 25 per cent) in Andian 40 per cent, in the Khojent and Samarkand districts, 80 percent (finer fibre 15’per cent.) in Bokhara, and 30 per cent, m Merv ; but very good crops are said to have been collected at Ashkabad, Tejen and Krasnovodsk. Bv the middle of November the exports of the 1906 crops to European Kussia amou Jed to 7 126,000 lbs. In 1905 the total quantity of fibre produced in Tur- Idcfon and Trans-Casuia, including the Khanates, amounted to 138,710 tons. The increased attention given to the cultivation of cotton has made the whole of Turkistan still more dependent on European Russia, Siberia and Persia for its supplies of corn. During the past year reports were frequent of the passage through Sarakhs of wheat, barley, lucerne, other forage, and sheep from Persia to Tejen, Kushk and Merv ; as an instance of the importance of Sarakhs as an entrepot on one day in September 2,000 camel-loads of forage passed through it and in 30 days of August and September 300 carts with wheat and. barley (? 215,000 lbs.) left it for Tejen.^ Khiva, unlike the rest of Turkistan, is self-sufficing in the matter of grain, and was estimated in 1907 to have available for export 48,500 cwt. of wheat, 22,000 cwt. of rice and nearly 5,000 cwt. of various grains suitable as forage for horses. According to a report of Eebruary 1907 the output of sugar iu the Sir Darya Province in the preceding year was very satisfactory ; one factory alone at Kaufmannskaya produced over . 125 - million pounds. Eresh discoveries of petroleum in very large quantities have been made throughout the year and the development of the oil-fields near Kokand is being actively prosecuted. In Eebruary it was reported that the Ohimion Oil fields near Yannovskaya had produced'since 1901 five million puds, or nearly 80,000 tons, at a total cost of £211,000 since the company was established in 1899. In August fresh discoveries were reported to have been made on these fields. At the end of 1906 the company started the manufacture of benzine, of which it exported 3,200 tons to European Russia during 1907. In March the Central Asian Oil Company was to begin boring on its 100-acre concession, the exact site of which is not known. In September prospecting was started at Sel Rokh, one of the properties of the Turkistan Oil Company which owns some 730 acres in all and in one property has bored to a depth of 3,250 feet. In November a concession of 110 acres was granted to Prince Khilkof at Maili Sai, vide p. 22. A valuable find of petroleum was also made on Nobel’s property on the Island of Cheleken in the Caspian Sea at the end of the year. At the end of December the spring which was spouting to a height of some 40 feet was giving a supply of 440 tons a day. In the 1906 Summary it is stated that coal was reported to have been found near Jnma. No further information has been received of this discovery and it appears possible that the report referred to the mine at Suok Bulok, near Karan Kul, vide p. 21. According to a report of October 1907 the seam at Suok Bulok is 6 feet thick, and contains coal of an excellent quality. In April it was announced that a seam, 20 feet thick, of good coal had been found at Suliktinski in the Tashkent District. Discoveries of lead and silver were reported in October to have been made at Taokchi Sai in the Alexandrovsk Division of the Tashkent District, and at Syakan, 25 miles south of Kokand. It is of interest to note, as an indication of the industrial growth of the eastern portion of Turkistan, that hanks are to be opened at the following places -in Kokand a private bank and a branch of the Imperial Bank, and at Vyerni a branch of the Siberian Bank.Climate and Health. The close o£ 1906 was marked by an earthquake at Andijan, where the Climate, post and telegraph office was wrecked as well as the railway sta'ion which had only recently been rebuilt, for the original buildings had been destroyed by the same cause in the previous year. The opening months of 1907 were characterized by severe snow-storms and extreme cold in Turkistan. By the middle of January the Oxus and its tributaries were frozen, the steamship service was entirely suspended, and one steamer was caught by the ice near Kerki where it remained until traffic was reopened at the end of February. In the last week of January a party of 300 recruits, accompanied by 80 carts, were caught in a blizzard on the Samr r- kand-Termez road, with the result that 5 recruits and carters died and many were frost-bitten ; the road appears to have remained blocked until the 8th February. Intense cold was also reported in Bokhara on the 21st February. At Sarakhs heavy snowfalls occurred in the beginning of January and again from the 6th—14th, while throughout the whole of February the road from this town to Tejen w r as impassable owing to heavy snow and rain&gt; While communications were thus interrupted along the Upper Oxus, on the lower part of the river heavy floods occurred ; for instance at the beginning of February the village of Sheikh Abbas, of 250 houses, in the Petro-Alexand- rovsk district was swept away. The severe winter was followed by exceptionally heavy rains from the middle of April to the beginning of July when serious damage was caused to the Central Asian Railway and the branch-line to Firyuza, vide pp. 18—22. From the 10th to the 28th April the Hari Bud was in high flood, and between the 9th and 28th of the following month it was at times impassable, and very heavy rain also fell at Sarakhs. The rains of the middle of May are said to have been the worst within the memory of the oldest inhabitants and at the end of that month much damage was caused to life and property in the Bokharan Khanate and the Tashkent district where 800 lives are said to have been lost. The Oxus was again in flood in the Petro-Alexandrovsk district and the KhivanKhanate at the end of April, and in the second ten days of June the neighbourhood of Askha- bad, and more particularly of Tejen, also suffered severely from the rains. In the beginning of July the Samarkand District was visited by extensive floods ; and at the end of October the Oxus once more was carrying away villages, on this occasion in the Ishan Jakent neighbourhood, while in December the Sir Darya was theatening to wash away the Tashkent Railway in places. The winter of 1907-1908 set in early in Bokhara and the Kata Kurghan and Ferghana districts where severe frosts occurred in the last ten days of October. On the 21st October the town of Karatagh, situated at a height of 2,100 feet near the head waters of the Surkhan in the Hissar Begship of Bokhara, was entirely destroyed by an earthquake. It is said that 4,000 5,000 lives were lost. The shock also did some damage to buildings at Termez, hut none to life, although in the neighbouring native town of Patta Kesar 600 persons are said to have been killed. The total number of deaths in the district are put at 10,000, including 1,000 at Hissar. The earthquake was preceded at a few days’ interval by a very destructive hail-storm which was more particularly severe in the neighbourhood of Kulab where a number of people, engaged in harvesting, were killed. The year 1907 appears to have been a very unhealthy one throughout Health Russian Turkistan where malarial fever has been more than usually prevalent in the autumn, not improbably as the result of the heavy rains of the spring. Termez was reported in August to be especially unhealthy ; the summer had been exceptionally hot and in the course of the previous twelve mouths 164 deaths, or 27 per mille for a garrison of 6,000, had occurred ; most of the troops at the time had been removed from the town, and its sanatorium at Derbent on the road to Samarkand was full of invalids. In the same month the smallfrarrison of Sarakhs lost 24 men from malaria, and the hospital accommodation had to be supplemented by 20 tents. In the following month malaria was also reported to be very prevalent in Trans-Caspia generally. In September, too, a fatal contagious disease, said to be plague, but by some considered to be malig. Bant pustule, made its appearance in Bokhara. Cholera, also, which had been raoW at Astrakhan in August, made its way from Baku m September, in spite of a strict quarantine at Krasnovodsk, into Trans-Caspia where isolated cases were reported from Krasnoyodsk and Mangashlik as well as from places along the railway, and by the end of the month it reached Tashkent. In October plague appeared at Atbashi (At Bazar) near Narin wdiere 44 families suddenly died. The Narin-Kashgar road was at once closed, and a strict quarantine, involving a 10 days’ detention of all travellers, was establish ed, but by the middle of November the disease had spread all along the left bank of the Narin up to the frontiers of Ferghana and China, and was causing many deaths in the Semirechya province where 10 quarantine posts had been created. In the beginning of November, however, deaths from the epidemic ceased at Atbashi, and by the end of that month the disease had diminished at Vyerni and Prjvalsk. At the end of December it was reported from Skobelef (New Marghelan) that a very fatal disease, believed to be plague, was raging amongst the Kirghiz on the Alai, where there had been a less serious epidemic of typhus iu the autumn. In the first 6 months of the year 5 cases of glanders were reported at Merv and 9 at Askhabad where cases had also occurred at the end of 1906, In the last week of September 73 horses died of lashohur which appears to be anthrax at Troitskoye where the Tashkent troops go into camp for their summer training, and about that time the same disease appeared among some droves of horses at Kauffmanskaya and in November at Ashkabad when there were 435 fatal cases in addition to 2 of glanders. At the beginning of November cattle plague was reported to be prevalent in the Imperial Domains at Bairam Ali, and in the middle of the month at the frontier guard post of Mergen-Uli, and at the Russian settlements of Mikhail- ovskoye and Skobolevka, all three near Askhabad, over which district it was, apparently, spreading. In December, too, it made its appearance at Kopal in Semirechya. NORTH CHINA. Political. Administration In May it was reported that the importance of the defence of Mongolia against of Mongolia. possible Russian aggression had led to a proposal being made by the local authorities for the separation of Inner and Outer Mongolia into 4 provinces, and that the Central Government were favourably disposed to it. The sugges tion is that both portions of Mongolia should be placed under a viceroy, °who in the case of Outer Mongolia would be the present Military Governor at Ulgassutai, and in that of Inner the Imperial Agent atUrga, Each viceroyalty would consist of 2 provinces, each under a governor. Outer Mongolia would comprise the Isliang Hai and Kobdo Khanates, which would form the pro vince of Northern Mongolia, and the Zassaktu Khanate which would be re named Western Mongolia. To Inner Mongolia would fall the Eastern pro- ince, i.e.y the present Tsetsen Khanate, and Central Mongolia, embracing Tuchetu and Sannoin. ^ Atoinis^ tion^of Humours have been current during the year of the proposed separation of Province, iN ew Dominion, or Hsin Ghiang province which includes Kashgaria into 2 distinct provinces with the Tian Shan as the line of partition. The Northern province would have its capital at Urumchi and the Southern at Aksu. Under this arrangement the Hsietai, or Tartar General at Urumchi, would be made a Viceroy. i, ^°?!i COl S? r is . lent to these rumours by a report, dated Hami, 19th Octo ber, that the Fu-tai, or Governor-General, of Hsin Chiang had asked to be31 moved to Aksu owing to his quarrels with the Hsietai who, according to good authority, made an attempt on the Fu-tai’s life towards the end of the year, Sarikol, Tung Kuan or Amban, Chiang Ta-lao-yieh, pro*Russian, from February when he succeeded Chang Ta-lao-yieh.

Owing to his omission to settle certain cases at Yarkand in which British Indian subjects were involved, he was sent back to Kashgar by the governor of the New Dominion at the instance of Mr. Macartney and was not allowed to leave that town until the middle of October when the outstanding cases were in a fair way to be settled by his successor. Hi, Eu-tai or Governor, Lien Tajen. Reference is made below to the increase of British prestige in Kashgaria. British influence owing to the active part taken by Mr. Macartney in the settlement of the dis- in Ka5h s sna ‘ turbances between the Mahommedans and Hindus in several towns. These disturbances brought forward again the question, which has been under consi deration for the last 14 years, of supplying the British representative in Kash gar with an escort drawn from the Indian army. It was, however, decided that Government should be asked to recognize Mr. Macartney as His Britannic Majes ty’s Consul in Chinese Turkistan. The Minister, however, did not consider it desirable to bring the matter before the Chinese Government until the conclu sion of the pending Anglo-Chinese convention in which larger questions of policy are involved. But in his despatch, No. 420 of 3rd September 1907, the and that elaborate repairs are also being made to the Aksu Yamen, The Fu-tai makes a feeble Governor and seems to be much in Russian hands. The following is a list of the more important Chinese officials in Kashgaria Chinese officials, during 1907:— Kashgar, Taotai, Yuen. Kashgar, Hsien Kuan, Tsien Talao-yieh, who was transferred in January from a similar appointment in Goma, where he was succeeded by Tsou-Ta-lao-yieh. Kashgar, Tung Shang, Lew Ta-lao-yieh. Kashgar, Hsing-ming or Secretary for Criminal Affairs to the Taotai, Li Ta-lao-yieh. Kashgar, Commandant of Troops, Yang Tunh-ling. Khotan, Chih-Chou, Che-Chajen. Bayik, Karawalchi, Baud Beg, pro-English, appointed in September. Tartar General, Commanding the troops in the New Dominion, Chiang Kuen (or Cheun); he is said to have greater powers, both civil and military, than the Fu-t-ai. At Urumchi is Prince Tsi-lan or Lan-kung, brother of the Emperor Kuang Hsu. This prince was banished to Urumchi at the time of the Boxer disturbances. no action should be taken until the general question of the status of our repre sentative in Kashgaria is settled. In this connection the Foreign Office suggested at the end of 1906 to the British Minister at Peking that the Chinese Minister reported the tacit acceptance by the Wai-wu Pu of the title of HisIj 'll rlr r / 32 /: i Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kashgar for Mr. Macartney, to whom instruc tions hare now been sent to adopt this title when a favourable opportunity British Aksakais Keli^ious or racial differences between British Indian subjects in Kash in VacVio'arin. . ® T • l i.1 » garia, more especially in the year under review, render the selection of an Aksakal to take charge of British interests in the several towns no easy matter. As far as possible an Aksakal holds office for 1-2 years and is alternately taken from Muhammadans and Hindus in some places and in others from Bajauris and Afghans. The following is a list of Aksakals :— Aksu, the post is in abeyance; it was intended to appoint Sher Zaman, an Afghan, but owing to the disturbances elsewhere it was decid ed in May to leave the appointment vacant for a time; Goma, Ming (or Meng) Rang, Shikarpuri; Kargalik, Assanad; Kashgar, Mulla Sabit; Khotan, where there are 20 Bajauris and 60 Afghans, the post is also in abeyance; in March Abul Khan, Bajauri, was succeeded by Badrmd-Uin, Afghan, but in June, owing to the remonstrances of the Bajauris, the appointment was cancelled ; Tangi Hissar, Hirabai; Yarkand, Buta Ram up to April when he was succeeded by Abdullah Jan, Bajauri, for 2 years. In May Safdar Ali Khan, ex-Mir of Hunza, asked the Chinese authorities for for the restoration of his grazing rights on the Taghdumbash, and that the mar riage of his daughter to Karim Beg, Hakim Beg or Governor or Sarikol, was likely to be of assistance to him. It was added that he would probably endea vour to obtain the restoration to him of Raskam. Later in the same month it was reported that Karim Beg had succeeded in bringing Safdar Ali’s family to his house in Tung. In December Karim Beg brought to Mr. Macartney’s notice a petition from the wife of Safdar Ali that the last named might be brought to Yarkand to live with her there. Russians continue to obtain both commercial and political concessions. Thus on the 1st July a Russian post office, under the control of the Russian * consul, was opened at Kashgar; it undertakes the transmission of money, and also receives telegrams for conveyance by road to Irkishtam, the terminus of the Russian telegraph. In May it was reported that a branch of the Russian- Chinese Bank was to be opened during the year at Khotan, but confirmation of this statement has not yet been received. It is proposed to give the management of the Mining Company which the Taotai of Kashgar is forming, vide page 37, to a Russian Engineer. The North China Herald stated in July that a secret concession had been given to the Russians to work the gold mines at Kiakhta in Mongolia. At Hi in the first week of August disturbances arose out of an attempt of the Hsien Kuan to suspend the Alim Akhun owing to the latter’s refusal to ^ ec ^ 0n ^ a divorce case in which a Russian subject was involved. The Alim Akhun was supported by his co-religionists from Andiiau who appealed to the Russian representative at Urumchi. It was then announced that troops were ready to march from Yarkent, and, consequently, the Hsien- Kuan was forced to abandon the position he had taken up in the question, with the result that the Chinese authorities suffered a considerable loss of prestige. offers. leave to remove from Kuchan to Yarkand; Mr. Macartney was instructed to oppose the request. In July it was reported that he was prosecuting intrigues Kuchar, Sahib Ali; Russo-Chinese Although the Chinese Government is showing an increased interest in Kashgaria, vide under Military, and British influence is extending, still the Relations.A disturbance was also caused at the end of October at Turfan by a Russian subject whose arrest was then attempted by the Chinese. Rut a Russian escort, from, it was said, Urumchi, interfered and wounded 10-15 Chinese soldiers. The matter has been reported by the Eu-tai to the Central Government, but no information has as yet been received of their action in the matter. A noteworthy feature in the first 6 months of the year was the exodus of some 50,000 labourers from Kashgaria to Russian Turkistan, wiiere they receive a daily wage of 1 rouble, which rose in August to 2 roubles, (2s. \\d. and Is. 3d. respectively), as compared with 2fd. in Kashgaria before, and 6|d. — 7fd. after, the exodus. At the end of Eebruary in Yarkand the intrigues of Afghans and Kash miris, exasperated, possibly, by the extortion of the Shikarpuri money-lenders in whose debt they were, led to an attempted attack by the Muhammadans of this town on the Hindus. The Amban, however, succeeded in dispersing the Muhammadans, but the situation became so critical, especially as there was but a small Chinese garrison in the town, that Mr. Macartney found it necessary to visit Yarkand. Here he arrived on the 18th March and, after several inter views with the leaders of the rival factions, succeeded in restoring the peace between them by the end of that month. In the meantime the disorders spread to Yangi Hissar and Kashgar, as also later to Merket Bazar in the Maralbashi District. Mr. Macartney, therefore, also visited the first named place and others in the neighbourhood of Yarkand with equally satisfactory results, but in the middle of May there was a recrudescence of the trouble at Yangi Hissar. Re turning to Kashgar, Mr. Macartney was able after some time to induce the Taotai to issue a “ Harmony Proclamation ”, calling on the Muhammadans to desist from the provocations which they were offering to the Hindus. This pro clamation was posted in Kashgar on the 31st May and at Yarkand and elsewhere ky the 29th of the following month. Thus ended, with a considerable increase of British prestige, a dispute which at one time threatened to lead to the inter vention of the Russian Consul, as the Andijanis at Yarkand were about to ask for his assistance at the time when Mr. Macartney arrived at that town. At Merket Bazar about the beginning of November the exactions of some 5-6 Hindu Shikarpuri money-lenders led to 2 attacks being made on them by the natives. The Maralbashi Chow-kuan in his enquiry into these disturbances showed a marked bias in favour of the natives and, it is said, instigated the Merket Begs to petition against both Bajauri Muhammadans and Hindus. Mr. Macartney’s representations to the Kashgar Taotai appear, however, likely to lead to the punishment of the Hindus* assailants and the dismissal of the Chief Beg of Merket. The unrest at this place is, apparently, due to a recent letter of the Eu-tai to the Kashgar Taotai which attacks the Shikarpuris for their exactions and states that “ Kashgar is not a port open for British trade. ” In July a rising occurred at Tun-huang where the Yamen was stormed and burnt. At Hami too, there was some trouble about the same time between the Wang and his Muhammadan subjects, some 10-20 of whom were killed; further fighting was prevented by the arrival of Tientsin-drilled troops. Dr. Stein reported that Hami was quiet at the end of October. At the end of November the Russian Consul at Kashgar received news of disturbances amongst the Tunganis at Manas, near Urumchi. Although the Turk! population of the Tarim Basin is peaceable, they are showing a marked tendency to resist Chinese operation and Chinese officials now levy taxes wdth a light hand and try to curry favour with the natives. Military. In July it was reported at Yarkand that 3 5,000 troops of the New Model had left Pekin for the New Dominion, and that 10,000 of them had reached Urumchi in the previous month.This report confirms an earlier statement made by the Rev. G. Hunter, of the China Inland Mission station at Urumchi, who arrived at Kashgar in Janu ary 1907. According to him there are numerous troops in the Hi and Urumchi provinces, which in this respect form a striking contrast to Chinese Turkistan south of ’ the Tian Shan. At Hi there are 8,000 troops drilled by Chinese officers in German methods, and German bugle-calls are used. This town also boasts a fairly equipped arsenal with some Krupp guns in good condition, and also a large modern military school, in which 100 Chinese boys are taught European 0 drill and the English and Russian languages. There is also a police force and the town is well drained. Among other efforts which the Chinese are making to improve their position in the Hi provinces is the construction of roads. In February news was received that the Tartar General at Hi, Chiang Kuen, was levying taxes with a view to raising the army in the Kew Dominion to 100,000 men. In November Captain Price Wood ascertained that 300 New Model troops had arrived at Switing, which is about 30 miles west of Kulja at the junction of the roads from this town to Tashkent and Urumchi. Eventually the garrison of the province was to be 40,000 men. Urumchi, according to inform ation given to him by the superior of the Belgian Mission, possessed a garrison of some thousands of New Model troops. Apart from the rumoured increase of the garrison of Yarkand in July to 200 dismounted and 100 mounted men, possibly as a consequence of the disturbances in the previous February, the Chinese appear to have taken no steps to improve their military position in Kashgaria. The garrison of Tash-Kurghan, for instance, was only 15 men at the beginning of the year. The garrison of Kulja where there is the usual Chinese fort, about 800 yards square, is nominally 500, but appears to be actually less than 500 men. The Russian Consulate here contains barracks with about 50 Cossacks under a Lieutenant. Communications. Kashgar- Road, The construction of this road which is wide enough for 2 carts was begun in mid-October 1906, and was apparently nearly completed by the middle of 1907, when it was said that the journey could be made by tarantass in 2 days from Kashgar to Narin, whence it is 5 days via Pishpek to the nearest station on the Tashkent railway. From Kashgar the road runs by the Tumen river, Upper Artush, Besak, Islik Kurghan (thus avoiding the Turgat river which is difficult to cross in summer), the easy Bakurat pass, and Mirza Tiarak in the Turgat valley, up which the road then ascends to the Turgat pass on the frontier. A loan of Rs. 20,000 was obtained from the Russian-Chinese bank for making the road, and a further loan of Rs. 10,000 appears to have been given for repairs in the middle of 1907 owing to damage caused by heavy rains, especially near the Turgat Pass. The site for the badge by which the road is to be earned over the Kashgar river has not yet been decided. The Russian Consul at Kashgar has proposed to build a bridge, 300 yards lono- and 15 feet broad, immediately north of the town, but the Taotai objects, more especially as the inhabitants of Kurghan are anxious that the road which now crosses the riveL by a ford at their town should not be diverted. The Kashgar branch of the Russo-Chinese bank, \v hich farms the dues on the road in return for its loan, made a proposal at the beginning of 1907, that it should take over the whole management of the transport on the road. It is not known whether the proposal has been accepted. According to the Russian Consul at Kashgar it is intended to ask the local autlioiitiea for permission to connect the road, when completed, with Andiian • probably this connection will start from Kizil Kurghan, 30 miles S. of the Turgat pass and run via the Suok river, the Suok pass, and the Turgat Pass m the Ferghana range. ° In October the road but it was temporarily allowed to go t&lt;?

Later reports suggested that this route is identical with that from the Titirip Pass in Hunza to Khunjerab, 30 miles, and thence up the valley of the Khunjerab river towards Shimshal. The other routes up the Shimshal valley are (a) from Passu, and (b) from the Kliunjerab and Oprang passes towards Hash am. The North China Herald stated in June that a railway school is to be Railway School, opened in Hi for the purpose of training Mongols, Manchus and Turks in the construction and management of railways. The first director of the school is to be prefect Chen Han, who at the time of the announcement was completing his railway studies in Russia. The Reverend G Hunter of the China Inland Mission arrived at Kashgar Travels * from Urumchi on the 20th January and left shortly afterwards with a view fco proceeding to Shanghai by Tashkent and the Siberian Railway. By the end of September he had returned to Ansichu en route to Urumchi where he intended to start mission work in conjunction with a Mr. A. Moore. A German scientitic mission, consisting of Prof. G. Merzbacher, Hr. Leuehs, Herr Rockinger and Prince Aruulf of Bavaria, left Kashgar in June for the Tian Shan. At the end of August Mr. C. Clementi, Assistant Colonial Secretary, Hong kong, arrived at Kashgar via the Tashkent Railway and Osh. He had some difficulty in obtaining permission from the Russian authorities to leave Russian Turkistan. He found the Taldik (Alai) road in bad repair in some places where it had been washed away. Early in August he left for Hongkong over land, and had reached Hami by the 19th October. Towards the end of July there also arrived iu Kashgar a Pinn, Baron Man- Man erheim. nerheim. He appears to be identical with a Baron Manerham wffio left Urum chi with Mr. Bauer (ride below) and separated from him to shoot in the Barakul. Mr. Bauer, an Austrian and manager of a firm in Kihtao, in Shantung, was met by Mr. Hunter at Ansichu in September. He had spent 3 months in Urumchi where, apparently, he had been studying the local trade on which, too, the Germans are said to have designs. On the 4th August Messrs. Holmes Tarn and Henderson reached Kashgar from India via Leh and Yarkand. Owing to- difficulties created by the Government of Russian Turkistan it was not until the 17th of the same month that they were permitted to proceed to Europe via Osh and Tashkent, Captain Hino, a Japanese officer, travelling from China, arrived at Kuchar on the 29th July and at Kashgar 12 days later. He is reported to have made numerous and detailed enquiries of the topography, population and resources of Chinese Turkistan during his journey through that country. At Yarkand he was received with great enthusiasm, and the troops w r ere paraded in his honour. In this neighbourhood he made a geological collection and astrono mical observations. Mr. E. Hadow passed through Haramosh about the middle of April on a shooting expedition to the Pamirs, and returned through Gilgit on the 16th November en route for India. He complained of difficulties in procuring transport at Subashi and Task Kurghan, and, as similar complaints were received from Major Eeilding and Mr. Henderson, the matter was reported to the Ting Kuan. In the winter of 1906-07, Captain Polovtsef, a brother of the Russian Consul-General at Bombay, arrived in India together with 3 other Russian officers. Captain Polovtsef is an officer of the General Staff, was one of Kuro- patkin’s A. D. Cs. during the War, and acted as Military Attache in London during a brief absence of Major-General Wogak in 1906. In April 1907, being at the time in Kashmir, he applied for permission to travel through that country to Chinese and Russian Turkistan. The request was at first refused, but, in view of this officer’s antecedents and the pending overtures w r ith Russia, His Excellency the Viceroy decided that Captain Polovtsef should be allowed36 to make the^joumey. Shortly afterwards an application was made that M. Andreief, who had been acting as private secretary to the Eussian Consul- General at Bombay and is shewn in Turkistan Calendars as a professor of Turkish and Persian in Tashkent, might be permitted to accompany Captain Poloytsef with a view to making a linguistic study of the tribes that they met. According to a report from Yarkand this gentleman possesses a fluent know* ledge of Urdu, Persian and Turki. This request was also granted, but, in order that some watch might be kept on the proceedings of these 2 Russians as far as the Chinese frontier, they were accompanied by Major Peilding, U.S.O., Coldstream Guards, who w r as returning to England via the Karakoram, Yarkand and Kashgar. Meeting at Srinagar in June, the party left that place on the 21st of the same month, reached Leh on the 11th July, and separated at Shahidulla in Chinese territory. Major Eeilding arrived at Yarkand on the 16th August, and at Kashgar on the 21th. Here he was detained by the Eussian Consul’s refusal to allow him to take his arms and Ladakhi servant into Eussian Turkistan. A reference was, therefore, necessary to the Ambassador at St. Petersburo’ before the prohibition w r as removed, and it was not until the 4th September that Major Eeilding was able to leave Opal, the summer resort of Kashgar. On the 16th of the same month he arrived without further difficulties at Osh. Captain Polovtsef and Mr. Andreief arrived at Yarkand the day before Major Eeilding. In this town they remained some days, making enquiries about the Mustagh, Mintaka, and other passes ; according to one report, too, they were frequently seen in Yarkand disguised as Andijanis. Prom here they proceeded to Sarikol, and remained at Tash Kurghan for 4 days where M. Andreief. who was locally said to be an Englishman, made numerous enquiries as to routes and affairs in Chitral and Kanjut. On the 3 0th September the two Russians left the Taghdumbash via the Bayik Pass for the Eussian Pamirs, whence they were to proceed to Osh via Pamirski Post and Shighnan. In the first week of June Captain J. Price Wood, 12th Royal Lancers, left India on a shooting expedition for Agoyas and Hi in Chinese Turkistan His itinerary has been as follows :—Baltit (Hunza), 3rd-4th June; Mintaka Aksai, 21st-22nd June, delayed 5 days by illness; Tashkurghan, 2nd-4th July • Yarkand, 14th-18th July; Maralbashi, 24tii*2Gth July; Aksu, lst-6th August • Kaihk, 10th August; Aksu Karaul, 13th, Agoyas river, 15th, and Kara Jung near the bridge over the Tekkes river on the Kulja road, 18th August. Leav ing Kulja m November he crossed into Eussian territory from Nikan in the Hi District on the 13th of that month and by the end * of December reached England, travelling by the Tashkent Railway. Dr. M. A.. Stein has continued his archmological researches in the eastern portion of Chinese Turkistan throughout the year and has been rewarded by the discovery of numerous Kharosthi, Chinese and Tibetan documents on wood and silk. His movements since the last quarter of 1906, have been as follows TnfiA 9 a 0 Al LO ^’ f I)0 ^ 0 ^ e ’ 22nd September; Keriya, 10th and Imam Jafii Sadik, 31st October; Endere, 11th November; Charklik, 5th December ; and over 100 miles of desert to the Lob Nor Desert, 6th—29th December, fTio JanilaI 7&gt; having examined some small ruins near the Janm and Charchan m route; Mirsm, 9th February here 3,000 Tibetan discovered ; Tun-huang Desert, 29th April, from here he explored KahavnoTr^ the Su ; Jl ' 110 ^ver through, and for 60—70 miles beyond, the 2 s ?nd luL L Chn^ d re . tur 1 I l ed to tlle Tun-huang Desort on the 16th May; Ansi, Wanff fu hsia w 1 ^ aDSU kT 12t i h July ’ liayiG S marched via Chiaotzu, suivc'v^^ ron^f^?

At this time Rai Sahib Lai Singh was surveying new routes in the Kuruktagh between Karashahr and Top-nor. Dr. Stein hopes to visit Kuchar early in 1908, and Khotan in March or April, returning to Ladakh about August. On the 20th June 1907, Rai Sahib Lai Singh, of the Indian Survey, left Hunza to join Dr. Stein. He was sent in relief of Lance JSaik Ram Singh who had broken down in health. On the 24th November an expedition which is financed by the Tsar left F Co '® ne . 1 KoztoPs Moscow for the exploration of the more inaccessible parts of Mongolia and cStaiAsia. t0 Thibet under the command of Colonel Kozlof, the well known Asiatic tiaveller, who took part in Prjevalski’s 4th expedition of 1886, the Pyevtzoff and Roborovski expeditions of the ‘ nineties, and himself conducted an expedition into Mongolia and Kham in 1899. He is accompanied by 3 civilians, 12 soldiers and 2 guides. The proposed route of the expedition is Yerkhne-udinsk, Kiakhta, Urga, Din-yuan-in, Gonju, Alashan, Koko-Nor (in the autumn of 1608), Lanchau (in the winter of 1908-03), Szuchuan and Sung-Panting ; its object is the exploration of S. Mongolia, the Koko-Nor district, the western slopes of the Nanshan, the Betkhara-Narin-Ula and Alashan ranges and Ordos. The party reached Kiakhta in December, and hoped to leave this place on the 10th January 1908 for Una where camels and horses were to be bought and the fitting out of the expedition to be completed. It is to return to Moscow in December 1910. . * Commercial. r . J * . , *., .. T}\\g North China Herald announced the end of June that the Chinese Fre ep° r ts- Government intended to make Kashgar, Yarkand, Yangi Hissar and Khotan free ports, and added that this would destroy the monopoly of trade that the Russians enjoyed in these towns. This rumour was repeated by the same paper, so far at least as Kashgar is concerned, at the end of August. The North China Herald stated in June that a local merchant, having Chinese enter- purchased a Bussian-owned cotton-mill, proposed to extend its capacity and pn5e ‘ provide it with new machinery, and that, with this object, a masterworkman, with the necesssary plant, had left Tientsin for Turfau. - The mining resources of China have been occupying the attention of the Central Government, which issued in the first half of the year an order that every province was to establish a special office for the encouragement of the mining industry, 'ibis office is styled Kuang-ehen-tiao-cha-chu, and the name Kuang-chen ni-yuen is given to the mining officials who are to be appointed to all important centres. It was probably a result of the foregoing order that the Kashgar Taotai in June endeavoured to turn the attention of the Kashmiris in the country to the coal and iron mines near Yangi Hissar and the petroleum at Kanjugan, 40 miles north-east of Kashgar. This action he followed up in August by conven ing a meeting of the more impoitant merchants with the object of forming a~ company, With a capital of Taels 12,000 in shares of Ts. 1,000 each, for working the go 1 d mines at Khotan and for generally exploiting the coal iron and petroleum in Kashgaria. He himself subscribed Ts. 4,000 and suggested that a Russian engineer should be engaged for a sum of Rs. 10,000 to manage the company. The following reports have been published in the course of 1907, on the Foreign trade, foreign tiadeof Chinese Turkistan, mz.:—Mr Kolokofs economic review of Kashgaria in the collection of Russian Consular reports for 1906, and “ Indo- Chinese 'iurkistan trade via Ladakh for the year ending 31st March, lOO?.” - . From the first of these returns it appears that the chief exports to Russia are:—cotton, raw and fabrics, £104,304 in 1905; wool and uoollen goods,38 including carpets, £47,970 ; silk, raw and fabrics, £9,390; and leather, £4,930. The chief import from Russia is cotton, raw and fabrics, £216,900; and next to it are moist sugar, matches and wool, each of £1,100—£1,400 in value. To India the chief exports in 1905 06, were silk, £65,500; charas, £25,500; animals £13,800; and woollen goods £8,100; and from India the chief articles of import were silk manufactured goods, £39,700, coral £15,500 and tea £11,100. The most valuable export, however, from Chinese Turkistan to India in 1906, was treasure, consisting mainly of Russian gold coins. j£fter deducting the value of the silver imported, there was a nett efflux from Turkistan of £78,200. On the other hand silver bars to the value of £52,800 were imported via Russian territoiy from China in 1905. The following table shows the value of the trade with Russia in 1905, and approximately, as given in the second of the above reports, for 190^, as also the trade with India for the latter year, omitting treasure — Export s from Chinese Turkistan.

He left Kashgar for Russia via Irkishtam on the 1st November. The terms of the St. Petersburg Treaty of 1881 preclude the levy of taxes on Chinese products, but, according to M. Levitof, a revision of the treaty might soon be possible when a fresh source of revenue might be found by taxing charas, which is smuggled in large qualities into Russian Turkistan where probably a quarter of the population are charas smokers. The Kashgar tenga appears to have had a fairly fixed value of annas 2 Exchange, pies 6 throughout 1908. In the preceding year it fluctuated between 9‘80 and 10-56 tengas to the rouble, while in previous years it has varied between 7J and 13 tengas to the rouble. CHINA. Political. Internal. During the year China has shown many signs of that tc awakening of the East ” which has frequently been foretold. A series of drastic reforms have 'been inaugurated, and great efforts are being made to improve the methods of Government and the condition of the people, as also to develop the resources of the country. The principal questions to which the Imperial Government has directed its attention are the suppression of the opium traffic, the removal of racial distinctions between Manehus and Chinese, and the development of the interior resources of the country by means of railways, etc. The edict abolishing the use of opium was issued on the 20th September 1906, The Opium Traf- and various regulations giving effect to the decree have since been promulgat- fic ' ed. The principal provisions of the edict are that the cultivation of opium is to cease ia ten years, that all opium shops and opium smokers are to be registered, that the sale of the drug is to be stopped gradually, and that the Wai-wu Pu is to approach the British Minister with reference to the annual reduction of opium imported, so that importation may cease within ten years. As the opium trade affects British interests connected with the export of India and the the drug from India, and its importation by British merchants into China, the 0pium lct * following arrangements have been agreed to between the British and Chinese Governments:— a) His Majesty’s Government accept in principle the proposal that the import of Indian opium into China shall be diminished by one- tenth annually, pari passu, with an equal decrease in the pro duction of the native drug up to the year 1911, and they will continue to reduce at the same rate the export in 1911 and sub sequent years on proof that China has carried out its share of the arrangements; (2) they have no objection to a Chinese official being stationed at Calcutta, provided that he has no powers of interference; (3) they are prepared to assent to such enhancement o f the customs and Ukin duty on foreign opium as will make its taxation in China equivalent to the taxation actually levied on native opium, differ ences in relative value and quality being taken into consider ation. The opium edict was, on first being promulgated, practically a dead letter. During 1907, however, a serious effort has been made by Government to enforce it, although the authorities are confronted with the great initial difficulty that most of the officials are themselves addicted to the drug. In sorne of the large cities, such as Shanghai, Xun-nan Eu, Kuei-yang Tu, all opium dens40 have heen closed, while the area under poppy-cultivation has, in several of the provinces, been considerably reduced. Removal of A conference of notables was convened by the Dowager Empress to prepare Racial Distinc- a scheme for removing racial distinctions between Chinese and IVXanelius within t,on3 ‘ the next ten years. The reforms to be effected are likely to include permission to the daughters of the upper classes of Chinamen to marry members of the Imperial family. , The Government In connection with this, it is a notable fact that every one of the new of Manchuria. p 0S f- s - n Government of Manchuria has been entrusted to a Chinese instead of a Man elm, and everyone to a Chinese who owes his political advancement to Yuan-shi K’ai. The new decree for the Government of Manchuria was issued on the 20th April, 1907. Hitherto each of the three provinces of Manchuria has been governed by a separate Tartar general. By the new decree, all these provinces are placed under a Viceroy, with a Governor in each province. Inauguration of A small step in the direction of constitutional government has been taken Lo ai beif-Govern- inauguration at Tientsin of a Municipal Council elected on modern lines. It is intended to extend this scheme of local self-government to the other provinces as soon as possible. Anti-railway Biots. Anti-dynas ic Biots. The Famine. Serious riots took place in the province of Sben-bsi in connection with the construction of the Hsi-an—Tung-kuan Railway. These, however, do not appear to have been caused by any popular prejudice against railways, but were due to the railway officials having appraised lands needed for the railway in a manner highly detrimental to the landowners. The mob burned down the railway office at Hua-yin Hsien, and tore down several miles of telegraph line. Troops were despatched to restore order and preserve the peace during the construction of the railway. Anti-d^nastic riots, fomented by secret societies, took place in the south of the province of Kiang-si, in December 1906, and in Kuang-tung at the end of May 19o7. In both cases the risings had to be suppressed by troops, and in the lat ter case over a hundred of the rebels were killed, including their leader. Towards the end of 1906 and during the early part of 1907 an area of about 50,000 square miles with a population of some 10 millions was affected by famine. This area included the northern part of the provinces of Kiang-su and An-hui, with a narrow strip on the eastern border of 1 Ho-nan and the southern boundary of Shan-tung. The famine was caused by incessant rains, and at one time 5,000 people were estimated to be dying daily in the famine region. Education. ^ Eor the first time in Chinese history, a competitive examination was held in July 1907, in Peking by order of the Ministry of Education, of young men and women desirous of going to the United States to study under government auspices. No less than 72 young men and 12 women presented themselves. Tlie sub jects of examination were English composition ; translation from English into Chinese and vice-versa; Latin, French, German, Arithmetic, Chemistry and Physiology ; History, Geography, Chinese composition and Algebra. .

This brings the number of towns in Manchuria open to foreign trade up to twenty-one. In feouthein China, Nau-ning, on the West River, was opened to foreign trade on 1st January 1JJ07. A«“ment h r.wr'd. , An a S reemen * concluded between Russia and China regarding customs ing the Northern duties on t ie northern Irontier of Manchuria provides for the preservation of a Customs. tree zone iOO li (33 miles) wide on each side of the Chinese Eastern railway,and also lays down that goods carried across the frontier by railway shall pay only two-thirds of the maritime customs dues, and shall not be subject, when transported into the interior, to transit dues in excess of that two-thirds. Sir Robert Hart, who for many years has been in charge of the Imperial of Maritime Customs resigned his appointment, and has been succeeded by Sir R. E. Bredon, K.C.M.G. The evacuation of Manchuria by the Russian and Japanese forces—fixed by Evacuation by the treaty of Portsmouth for the 15th April—was completed by both Powers ussiaan apaa ' before that date. By the terms of the treaty, however, each power is allowed to keep 15 men per kilometre as guards for their respective railways. This permits of Russia continuing to maintain a force of 27,550 men, and Japan a force of 14,675 men iu Manchuria. With regard to the railway guards, the whole force now retained by Japan in Manchuria is one Division—the 14th, with headquarters at Liao-yang and three battalions of reservists. This number of troops represents 10 men per kilometre, which is 5 men less than the conventionally fixed complement. It is stated that the Chinese force for the purpose of garrisoning Manchuria will in future number 40,000 men, of whom 10,000 will be stationed at Mukden, and a considerable number in Hei-lung-kiang. In consequence of the occurrence of numerous piratical outrages in the t o ponce h the West Canton Delta, a British flotilla, consisting of nine torpedo-boat destroyers and River, sloops and two picket boats, was despatched towards the close of the year to police the West River. As a result of the enforcement of the anti-opium regulations a serious dis- M ?gfon UC p r 0 e n rais J f turbance took place at K’ai Hsien in June, in the Kuei-chou prefecture of Ssu- a t K S ’aTHsien? 1Sea ch’uan, in the course of which the premises of the China Inland Mission at that place were destroyed. Military. Considerable progress was made during the year in the reorganization of the Chinese Army. A number of young Chinese officers—graduates of military academies at home and abroad—were sent by the Ministry of War to Ch’ahar, Mongolia and Hi in Northern Chinese Turkistan, to organize the Mongol irregular cavalry of Ch’ahar and the Manchu military colonists of Hi, into regi ments and battalions, in accordance with the schemes of the Council of Army Reorganisation in Peking. It has also been decided to establish four classes of Military Schools, which are designed to impart instruction from the elementary up to the highest branches of the military art. The first class of school is the Cadet School, where ordinary school subjects are taught, but where special attention is paid to patriotism, courage, and physical culture, in order to lay the foundation of the military spirit.” The next is the Army Middle School, in which the higher school sub jects are taught, and the elements of the military profession. After this comes the Military A cademy. This is devoted to the instruction of entirely military subjects, and it is here that the young officer enters upon, his career. Finally comes the Higher Military School, which corresponds to our Staff College, and in which the higher branches of the art of war are taught to specially selected Reorganization of the Chinese for ces. Military Schools. officers. A youth after 3 years in a Cadet School passes to a Middle School, where he remains 2 years. He then serves for 4 months as a private or non-commis sioned officer in one or other branches of the service, after which he passes to the Military Academy, where he undergoes an 18 months’ course. He then receives the rank of ensign, and after some years’ service, if he shows any conspicuous ability, is selected for a course at the Higher Military School. The military schools already existing at Tientsin and Pao-ting Pu have been placed under the direct control of the Minister of War. Every effort is being made to arm the troops throughout the empire with Ar ™*™** of the the same type of weapon. As far as the first seven divisions of the infantry areconcerned this reform has to a large extent been carried out, five divisions having the German infantry weapon, while two are armed with the Japanese 6 5 m. m. rifle. As regards artillery, however, there is still a great diversity of patterns in the guns. Some divisions possess guns of the Japanese Arisaka model, some have guns of Krupp pattern, and others again have the Creusot type. A certain amount of homogeneity is nevertheless secured by assigning different patterns of guns to separate divisions. Thus, the 1st and 2nd Divi sions are armed exclusively with guns of the Arisaka model ; the 3rd and 4th Divisions have guns of Krupp pattern only ; the 5th and 6th Divisions have old-fashioned guns, mostly of Krupp manufacture ; the 7th Division have only the Creusot pattern of gun. Distribution or the Eight Divisions of the reformed army of China are now complete and are various Divisions, located as follows :—the 1st and 3rd Divisions at Pao-ting Fu, the 2nd at Shan-habkuan, the 4th at Ma-ch’ang, the 5th at Tsi-nan Fu, the 6th at Peking, the 7th at Cheng-ting Fu, and the 8th in Shan-tuug. The Kiang-su The Viceroy of Kiang-su obtained sanction during the year to raise four divisions, or 50,000 men, in Kiang-su. This will constitute its territorial army in connection with the scheme of reorganisation throughout the empire. The Kuang-tung The Kuang-tung army now consists of about 24,000 men, organised Army. | n gonie §q battalions or ‘ ying\ and 48 quick-firing mountain guns of Krupp manufacture. Out of this total six battalions are “ foreign-drilled,” and to these foreign-drill troops 36 of the guns are attached. Garrison of fcoag- The garrison of the colony of Hongkong consisted at the beginning of the ong year of 1,618 British and 1,950 Indian troops, and 65 Chinese, or a total of 3,633 regulars of all ranks. Naval. N £on Reorganiza- China is making an effort to reorganize her Navy. The work of reform has been placed entirely in the hands of H. E. Wang Shih-chdn, Acting Junior Vice-President of the Ministry of War. Naval Bases. Naval Training. The following places have been selected as bases for the future reorganized Navy :—The Ch’ang-shan group of islands in the vicinity of Yung-ch’eng Bay, Shan-tung province ; the islands of the Chu-san Archipelago, certain islands of the Miao-tao group in the Yellow Sea, the Island of Hai-nan, and Santuao in Fu-kien Province. The Board of War has resolved to establish at once a naval academy in Tientsin and naval schools in Nanking, Wu-ch’ang, Canton, and Foochow, where selected officers can be trained for a new Chinese Navy to be created later on. Japanese and English officers will be engaged as instructors. Six students of the Nan-yang Naval College, who underwent a course of training on British warships from 1904 to 1906, were on completion of their course appointed for service with the JPei-yang and Nan-yang squadrons. Six sub-lieutenants of the Chinese Navy, who served as midshipmen on board the British squadron in Chinese Waters, left Shanghai during the year for England to continue their training in the British Navy. Fortresses. ^Germany is^strengthening the defences of Kiao-chou, and establishing artillery and mining depots there. A sum of £ 37,500 has been allotted in the German budget for the defences of the colony. This amount is intended for fortifications to make the place secure against Chinese attacks from the land; to provide defence against bombardment from the sea, much greater sums would be required. According to the official annual report on the territory of Kiao-chou, the colony has made steady progress. Shipping shows an increase of 56 000 tons registered, and the income of the colony has increased by 37 per cent. TheShan-tung railway influences most favourably the development of the Hinter land. The relations of the Tsing*tau Government with the Chinese officials are good. Communications. 'Railways. i .. ».„• , - - 1 • • ■* * Considerable progress was made in the improvement of existing, and in the construction of, new railways. The principal undertakings and improvements are mentioned below :— It has been decided to construct a single line on the proposed Tientsin- Ti k e i n a t ®g n R ai!way. Chin-kiang Railway, and to borrow from British and German capitalists the sum of £ 5,000,000, guaranteed by the public revenues of the three provinces through which the railway will pass, viz., Chih-li, Shan-tung and Kiang-su. The K’ai-feng-Cheng-chou Railway, which is a branch of the trunk line from Peking to Han-kow, has been completed and is now open to traffic. This railway, built with French capital, is about 132 miles in length. It ^af-yuan^iT starts from Chen-tou on the Peking-Hankow trunk line (close to the city of Railway. Chengding Fu), had reached Yu-tzu Hsien at the end of 1906, and was opened to traffic throughout its entire length on the 6th November 1907. The company, formed by the Japanese Government to work this railwayj took over control from the military administration on the 1st April 1907. The wa y. work of doubling the track is being taken in hand, and the section between Tairen and Kin-chou will be the first to be completed. China purchased the Hsin-min-t’un—Mukden line from Japan at a cost of HS M n uk de n t,U Eaii £166,000. The line will be converted to the standard gauge ; its name has been way. changed to the Peking-Mukden Railway and it will form part of the Northern Railways system. Through trains are now running from Tientsin direct to Mukden. The Chinese have lowered the rates on this line by 25 per cent, with the result that much of the goods traffic to Mukden has been diverted from the South Manchurian Railway. The new railway line from Shanghai to Chen-kiang Fu was opened S klnf^aUway on October 15th, 1907, the remaining portion to Nan-king is nearing com pletion. The construction of the Canton-Kowloon Railway by British engineers and Canton Kowloon with British capital was sanctioned by an Imperial edict. Work on the line is al y ‘ being pressed forward at the Kowloon end, and the boring of the tunnel through the range of hills behind Kowloon has been commenced. The first section of the Canton-Hankow Railway, 12 miles in length, has been opened, and one train runs daily between Canton and Kong-chun. Canton-Hankow Railway. The first section of this line, from Peking to Nan-k’on, a distance R^f^ay g ' Kalgan of 40 miles, has been completed. The work has been executed entirely by Chinese engineers, and is of a high order. Some 2,000,000 taels were raised by the sale of shares and by taxation for ssu-ch’uan the construction of a Ssu-ch’uan-Hankow Railway. Hankow. The railway from Wuhu to Hu-chou is making substantial progress, and Wuhu-Hu-cHoa, extensive bridging works are being undertaken. The first 33 kilometres of the line from Lao-Kai to Yiin-nan Fu are finish- The Yun-nan ed, and construction trains are running regularly. The road is ready as far as ai way * the 58th kilometre, but the rails are not yet laid. The line is expected to be open to Meng-tze in March 1908.Inland Water. Dredging of the LiaoHo. Navigation of A combine of four Japanese Companies, with a capital of 12,000,000 yen is me Yang-tzu. reported to have been arranged for the Yang-tzu shipping trade. The Company’s steamers will also ply from Shanghai to Hongkong, Canton, Tairen and North China Ports. A sum of 490,000 yen has been appropriated by the Japanese Government for the purpose of dredging the Liao Ho between Mukden and Ying-k’ou. Maritime. Europe to Ch ing. The preliminary steps were taken by La Ccmpagnie des Chargeurs Biunis wang- ao to open a monthly service of steamers from Europe to Ch’ing-wang-tao. Hongkong- Messrs.

Negotiations were reported to be proceeding during the year between China and Japan regarding the construction of a joint cable from Cbefoo to Dalny to replace the former cable belonging to the Great Northern Cable Com pany, which was destroyed at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War. Best Office. localities open to postal business increased from 1 626 in 113 000 oou 6 ^ 1906 ' a “ d the number of articles dea lt with from 76,000,000 to Trade. , According to the figures published by the Chinese Imperial Customs, the foreign trade of China for 1905 and 1906* was as follows 1905 Hk. TIs. 1906 Hk. TIs. Imports. 447,100,791 410,270,082 Exports. 227,888,197 236,456,739 Total. 674,988,988 643,726,821 Gold Mines. Installation of the Raja of Ma nipur. The decrease in the total for 1906 is attributed to adverse circumstances and overstocking due to a too optimistic anticipation of the demand likely to lollow the Russo-Japanese War. The Hei-lung-kiang gold mines, which ever since the Boxer trouble have been in die hands of Russians, are to be handed back at cost to China. These mines are said to be exceptionally rich. ASSAM. Political. XT* ^^h May, Major Shakespear, Political Agent, Manipur, invested is Highness, Raja Chura Chand Singh, with full powers in his State. The Kaja is to be assisted by a Durbar, consisting of six Manipuri gentlemen and a member of the Indian Civil Service, who will act as Vice-President of the Council. * Figures for 1S07 not jet published.The trans-frontier village of Kehomi, having refused to make the reparation Punitive Expedi. demanded on account of an attack by some of its members on a party of traders of^homi vill * ge belonging to the British village of Seromi, Mr. Dundas, Sub-Divisional Officer, 6 0ml ’ Mokochang, accompanied by 80 rifles of the Naga Hills Military Police under Captain Bliss, proceeded to inflict punishment. On arrival at Kehomi, the force found the village in flames and the inhabitants in full flight. Pour of the villagers were killed, a large quantity of grain and building material burned, and a consid erable amount of livestock killed or captured. The Government of India express ed their approval of the manner in which the expedition had been carried out. The chief of the unadministered villages of Zongling in the Lushai Hills vn ® ut J a o | e z ^ ^ having refused to make reparation for certain kidnapping outrages, committed and proposedFua^ on persons belonging to the British villages of Pemthar and Siata during 1906, tive Ex P editi on* the Lieutenant-Governor in January 1907 obtained sanction to send a punitive expedition against the village. Action was, however, postponed, as it was brought to notice that no clear territorial boundary existed to the south of the Lushai Hills District and that British and independent villages lay interspersed throughout a considerable area. In March 1907, the Superintendent, Lushai Hills, reported that the village of Zongling had surrendered all the captives taken from the village of Pemthar, and that further operations had been post poned till the following season. BHUTAN. . ti Political. The only event of importance in connection with Bhutan was the election Electl ° n of the of the Tongsa Penlop as hereditary Maharaja of Bhutan. The Bhutan Durbar HerSftaryRuier resolved to offer therulership of Bhutan to the Tongsa Penlop in December 1906, of Bhutan, but it was not till the 17th December of the present year that his election as Maharaja was actually proclaimed at Punakha in Bhutan. Mr. Claude White, Political Officer, Sikkim, Major Bennick, Chief of the Staff’s Division, Army Head Quarters, and an officer of the Political Department, attended the proclamation on behalf of the Government of India. It is understood that the installation of the Tongsa Penlop as Maharaja will not take place until the year 1909. BURMA. Political. A party under the command of Mr. Gordon, Assistant Political Officer, Bur ' ia ‘ ChInft Kengtung, started on the 1st January to erect pillars on the section of the ° un ar7 ‘ Burma-China boundary between Panghsang Nalawt and the Mekong. Mr. Gordon was met on the frontier by the Chinese boundary party, and the work was completed without incident. With regard to the boundary north of 25° 35' the Government of Burma informed the Government of India that, in their opinion, the eastern watershed of the ’Nmaikha river was the only boundary which could be laid down with advantage to both countries. They considered that any proposal to adopt any other line west of the watershed should be strenuously resisted, and recommend ed the extension of effective occupation and administration up to the suggested boundary line. On the Namting-Nawlawt section the Chinese claimed that the boundary proposed by Sir G. Scott was drawn so as to pass through a tract of country called K’ung Ming Shan, in Chinese territory, and they therefore requested His Majesty’s Government to appoint an officer to undertake an examination of the locality in conjunction with a Chinese official.46 Raid from Chinese Territory upon the village of Tulum. Attack upon Auche Police Post. Affray between Shandus and Kons. In April a raid was made by some men of Manbang village, in the Chinese state of Mono-wan, noon the British Kaehin village of ulum. A few cattle were carried off, but no one was injured. A demand for reparation has been made to the Chinese authorities, An attack was made in March upon the Police Post of Auche by some fifteen or twenty Kachins belonging to villages m the Sana Country across the administrative border. There were no casualties among the police, hut four Kackins of the attacking party were wounded. Steps have been taken to improve the defences of the post, and the garrison has been increased. . A somewhat serious affray took place between certain members of the Shandu and Kon tribes in the unadministered territory that lies between the Northern Arakan Hill Tracts and the Chin Hills. Early in the year the chief of the Shandu village of Sabaung, accompanied by some thirty-seven of his villagers, set out southward upon a tribute collecting expedition. Upon reaching the Kon village of Bahai the party were invited to a feast by the inhabitants of that village, after which the whole Shandu party were set upon and treacherously murdered, with the exception of two who managed to effect their escape. It was feared that the Shandu tribe would attempt to avenge the murder of their fellow-tribesmen, but so far no further fighting has taken place, and mean while British ofiicials have been despatched to the disturbed area to endeavour to bring about a settlement of the quarrel. A notification was issued in October extending the Kachin Hills Regula tion to certain tracts beyond the confluence of the ’Nmaikha and Malikha rivers, and establishing 'a military police post at Kwitao Kerry during the open season of each year. Mr. Hertz, Deputy Commissioner of the Myitkyina District, accompanied by Major Whitehead as Intelligence Officer, made a tour lasting some seven weeks in the Hukong Valley, and was hospitably received. Sao Kut, the Wa leader, who enjoyed a considerable reputation among the hill tribes as a spiritual teacher, died during the year. Communications. Hallways. The Secretary of State having sanctioned a reconnaissance of the country between Teng-yueh and Tali Eu with a view to the construction of this railway, Mr. Lilley with a survey party left Teng-yueh on the 8th February. No difficulties were experienced and the results were satisfactory. A map on the scale of one inch to a mile was made; the course of the Yang-pi and Shun-pi rivers was ascertained : and three new passes were discovered, several hundred feet lower than those on the trade route. The conclusions which Mr. Lilley formed from his observations were that no insuperable obstacle exists to the construction of a line between Teng-yueh and Tali Eu, that its length would not exceed 250 miles, and that its capital cost including equipment for electri cal working would not exceed 480 lakhs. Mr. Lilley noted that facilities were available for working the entire length of the line electrically. A railway on the metre gauge from Pegu to Moulmein, a distance of 121 miles, was opened in September. Henzada-Kyangia. A section of this railway, 23 miles in length, was opened for traffic in April. Shwebo-Yeu. The Railway Board sanctioned the making of a survey from Shwebo, on the Mu Valley Railway, to Yeu; a distance of about 22 miles.

Defences, A sum of Es. 10,000 was allotted in the Budget Estimate for 1907-08 for Rangoon, the mounting of two 8' B. L. guns at Monkey Point, and a sum of Es. 20,000 for the re-distribution of the lighter Q. E. guns of the Eangoon Defences. Harbours. A scheme, drawn up by the Burma Government for training the Eangoon Rangoon. Eiver at Eangoon, at a cost of 1J crores of rupees, has been submitted to the Government of India. INDO-CHINA. Political. Internal* The principal event of the year has been the deposition of the King of Kiflg oC Annam, who was declared to be insane. The throne has been abdicated in favour of the King’s second son, aged eight, and a Council of Eegency has been established. The Erench Government is making efforts to give the higher and influen- coniuftative Conf- tial classes of the native population a greater share in the administration of mission of Native the country. By a decree dated 1st May 1907 there was instituted in each in eadl province of Tonkin a consultative commission ou an elective basis, composed of native notables, in the proportion of one notable from each district (huySn) of seven cantons or less, and two notables for each district of more than seven cantons. The business of the commission will be to assist in the preparation of the provincial budget \ to make proposals for the undertaking of public works, and to he oousulted generally on various questions affecting the province. The members of the commission will be elected for a period of three years, and will meet at least twice yearly. Another decree, dated 4th May 1907, constitutes in Tonkin a native con- Formation of a sultative chamber, whose function will he to advise the Government on all questions relating to native taxation. This chamber is divided into three sec- Tonkin, tions, each representing different classes of the population. The members of the first two sections, which represent the Annamite portion of the community, will be elected ; the members of the third section, which represents natives of other than Annamite race, will be nominated by the Governor-General. The rigorous steps taken by China to suppress the opium traffic are The opium finding their counterpart in India-China. A decree, dated 19th June 1907, Traffic - forbids completely the opening of opium shops in Annam or Tonkin, and also prohibits the opening of any new opium shops in Cochin-China or Cambodia. Military. ' r C. '■ '« • ^ ... r . ',7 Considerable changes, of which the most important is the abolition of the Garrison of indo* China Reserve Brigade, have been carried out in the garrison of Indo-China. The Erench Government and the Colonial authorities appear to have come to the conclusion that the safety of Indo-China is chiefly dependent upon the position of France as a naval power. China and Siam on her land frontiers are not regarded as dangerous neighbours, and it is recognised that the entente recently concluded with Japan has caused a considerable change in the situa tion. It is consequently considered that a great reduction might be effected in the strength of the land forces without seriously ^ impairing the safety of the colony, while at the same time no small gain in economy would be secured.A proposal to maintain only the following garrison has been submitted In Tonkin— 1 Divisional General. 2 Brigadier-Generals. 2 Field Batteries. 2 Mountain Batteries. 2 Regiments, each of 3 Battalions, of Colonial Infantry. 3 Battalions of the Foreign Legion. 4 Regiments, each of 3 Battalions, of Native Infantry. 1 Squadron Cavalry. Transport train, 250 strong. In Cochin-China— 1 Brigadier-General. 7 Garrison Batteries, 2 Field Batteries. 2 Mountain Batteries. 1 Company Engineers. 1 Company Artificers. 1 Regiment, of 3 battalions, of Colonial Infantry. 1 Regiment, of 4 battalions, of Native (Annamite) Infantry. r . 1 Battalion, Native (Cambodian) Infantry. Communications. Hallways. Railway construction is making steady progress. The following is a summary of the work accomplished during the year :— Work has been begun on tbe construction of a branch line from Phan- rang to Lang bian plateau. The Coast Rail- O n the north a considerable section of this line has been built and work day (Saigon- ing for some time, i.e., from Hanoi to Vinh. In the middle a small section aoo,^, from Tourane to Hue has been recently opened and its extension northwards as far as Quang-tri will be opened next year. In the south the section from Saigon to Nha-trang (or Khan-hoa) has been completed for about 120 kilometres. It will be open to Phan-tiet in about one year and to Nha-trang in probably 3 or 4 years. When the sections have been finished it will be necessary to join up Nha-trang to Tourane, and Quang-tri to Vinh, in order to have complete railway communication between Saigon and Hanoi. , A line from Hot de FObservatoire to Faifoo was opened for traffic on the 29th April. The line has a length of 35-4 kilometres, and the gauge is c. m. 60. The principal stations are, Hot de PObservatoire, which may be considered as forming the port of Tourane, Mykhe, which will be tbe station for Tourane, and Pai'oo, the chief town of the province of Quang-nam, and an important commercial centre. Phan-rang—Lang* bian Plateau. L’llot de PObser vatoire-Faifoo Railway. Hoads. Qnang.tri-—Savan. The road from Qnang-tri to Savannaket is being rapidly made, and should naket. be finished in 1908. At the Savannaket end 132 kilometres are fit for vehicles. As soon as this road, and the section of the railway between Qnang-tri and Hu 6 are finished, the port of Tourane will become a place of some importance, forming tbe outlet of tbe produce of Lower Laos.Pigeon Post. Carrier-pigeon posts have been established between the islands of Nno- chou and Tang-bai and the chief town of the territory by M. Gantrib, Governor of the District of Kuang-chou. JAPAN. Political. Internal, The most striking feature in the internal condition of Japan during the Unrest and Labour year has been the state of unrest prevailing throughout the country, especially Trouble s- among the industrial and labour classes. This is ascribable to the increased cost of living consequent upon low wages, combined with excessive taxation. Strikes and industrial riots are growing in frequency, and some of the former were only adjusted with the greatest difficulty. In each case the attitude of the men towards their superiors was of a menacing character, and quite new in the industrial history of the country. A remarkable feature in some of the riots was the systematic military organisation adopted by the mob in its attacks on the police. This characteristic was particularly observable in the riots which occurred among the Besshi miners at Nibama, in Northern Japan, who fought under commanders as in battle, and deployed and manoeuvred like soldiers. They respected schools and hospitals, but completely destroyed the buildings and machinery of the mining company. The authorities were entirely at the mercy of the rioters, and it was only with the aid of men landed from a cruiser that the disturbance was eventually suppressed. During the war wuth Russia an immense amount of money was expended among the” people for labour and supplies, but now that this expenditure lias ceased, the country is beginning to feel a reaction that presses with especial severity on the masses, which are very poor. For the first time since the freedom of the lower orders of society from the stern discipline of the old feudal system, they are being put to the test as to whether or not they are capable of using this freedom aright. The spirit of Bushido does not seem to have much effect on the labouring classes of Japan. The tendency to despise authority seems to have invaded even the educa tional life of the country. In one of the largest cities of the Empire, an important school, Tvith an attendance of some hundreds of students, was recently closed by order of the Government, because the masters in charge were unable to control the riotous pupils. Foreign. While the relations of Japan w ith Europe have been considerably improved General, by the respective agreements concluded with France and Russia, the question of Japanese immigration to the Pacific Coast of America has caused considerable friction with the United States and Canada. The anti-Asiatic feeling in America appears to be partly due to labour agi- f e ”fh J g apal P se the tators, who are striving to stir up racial prejudice in order to influence votes for united states and their own political purposes. But the competition of yellow with white labour, Canada, and the danger of the former driving out the latter, is undoubtedly the main cause of the agitation, and intense animosity has been roused among the white labouring population of the Pacific Coast against Asiatics in general, and the Japanese in particular. The anti* Japanese riots which took place during the year at San Francisco, Vancouver, and other towns along the Pacific sea-board, threatened at one time to have serious consequences, but the efforts of the governments of the United States and Canada, respectively, to remove the causes of friction, and the attitudeof moderation preserved throughout by Japan, promise to lead to a satisfactory settlement of the question. Towards the close of the year Mr. Taft, United States Minister of War and Mr. Lemieux. Canadian Minister of Labour, were despatched by their respective governments to Japan with a view to arriving at an understanding on the matter, and the results of both missions are likely to prove acceptable to all parties. The Franco- Japanese Agree- ^ l11 agreement with France was signed consolidating the friendly relations ^ent. between the two countries The two governments bind themselves to mutually support one another in order to assure the peace and security of the regions adjacent to the territories where they have rights of sovereignty, protection or occupation, with a view to the maintenance of the respective positions and territorial rights of the two contracting parties on the Asiatic Continent. The Russo-Japa nese Convention. A Russo-Japanese Convention was signed on the 30th July, 1907. It contains two articles. The first provides that each of the contracting parties shall respect the present territorial integrity of the other, as well as all rights accruing to the other from existing treaties with China, so far as these rights are not incompatible with the principle of equal opportunity enunciated in the treaty of Portsmouth, and in the special conventions concluded between Japan and Russia. The second article provides for the recognition bv both contracting parties of China’s integrity, as well as for equal opportunity of commerce and industry for all nations in the said Empire. Both powers also pledge themselves to maintain the ‘ status quo * with all peaceable means at their disposal. The new com pa ot is regarded as a powerful addition to the guarantee of peace m the Ear East. &amp; £Xnf? a Se n . , ' Jhe Russo-Japanese Fisheries Convention, regulating the rights of Russian tio„ and Treatyofand Japanese subjects as regards fishing, and collecting and treating marine NaTigaHon. fs ' 3 Sca (,f f r j ie Sea of Okhotsk, and Behring Sea, was ratified on the 10 th September.

Increase in Caval ry-Tlie Field Artillery is being armed with a new gim of greater power and range than the old Arisaka gun. The new gim is said to have an effective range of 7,500 yards, and in it the wedge system has been adopted instead of the screw breech-block system. It has been further decided to create two brigades of Heavy Field Artil lery. Each brigade will have two or three regiments of six batteries, each battery consisting of four guns. For the present these guns will be 12 c.m. and 15 c.m. howitzers of Creusot manufacture. The Japanese army will probably adopt the Kexer automatic rifle as its Machine Guns machine gun. A machine gun division has not yet, for financial reasons, been organised, but it is under consideration to attach two or three machine guns to each cavalry and infantry regiment. It has been decided to form a Communications Corps, consisting of Communications two regiments. A field balloon battalion is to form the basis of the Communi- Cor P s - cations Brigade. When the military balloon has emerged from the experimental stage, it is Balloon Sections, expected that four balloon sections will be formed—one for each Field Army. The three existing telegraph companies are to he increased to eight, and Telegraph Com- formed into a battalion. pames. It has been realised that heavier and stronger material is required for Pontoon Trains, bridging, owing to the adoption of heavy Field Artillery, and consequently four pontoon trains, each capable of bridging a space of 500 metres^ will in future form the establishment, one being allotted to each Field Army. The length of the bridging material is to he reduced from 141 to 40 or 50 metres, experience having shown that the latter length is sufficient for all practical purposes. The existing Bailway Battalion of four companies is to have its strength J?Q n iIway Batta increased to 16 companies, as it was found during the war that the transport service was far more quickly and efficiently carried out by means of light railways laid in rear of advancing troops than by the usual transport of carts, etc. In future, khaki is to he the only wear in the Japanese army—cloth for Uniform, winter and calico for summer. There is to be only one quality for officers and men. Grades will only be distinguished by means of stars and galloons. The colour and numbering of the collar will be the only means of differentiating the various arms. There will be a soft head-dress, and yellow hoots. Japan has withdrawn all troops from Manchuria with the exception of one ^^ u ^J rrison division and a specially organised guard for the purpose of guarding the an una ' railway which will, in addition to its other duties, act as a kind of police. The guard will be recruited from soldiers who have gone to the reserve. Operations on a considerable scale were carried out during the year against Operations in For- the aborigines of Formosa, and the task of subjugating them is being steadily Ir ‘ osa ’ prosecuted, though not yet completed. The region occupied by the hostile natives is situated on the east coast, and covers some 70,000 square miles of the richest territory, consisting princi pally of camphor forests. The savages number about 100,000, aud the force employed against them consisted as follows :— Police Officers (Japanese) ... 96 Non-Commisdoned Officers (Japanese) ... • •• ... 359 Aiju (Chinese) ... ••• »•« ... 4,467 Although it is recognised that the task of subjugation will be arduous and slow, it has been resolved to bring tbe savages finally under control, and witli this idea roads are being constructed in the portions of the country opened up at each successive advance.Saghalien. Manoeuvres, On the 26th June the Taroko stronghold of Taito was destroyed after a bombardment by the Japanese fleet. An Aiyu force, assisted by an aboriginal tribe, co-operated on the land side. The stronghold was completely broken up, and the remnant of its inhabitants fled to the mountains. The operations were continued till the middle of August, and a number of the enemy’s other strong holds were captured. On the *0th August the Aiyu force was disbanded. Their casualties throughout the campaign amounted to 250, including 69 killed. The Japanese have been very active in Saghalien, and are rapidly fortify, ing their half of the island. Manoeuvres on a larger scale than any which have hitherto been held in Japan took place in November in the Yuki district. Pour divisions, besides a number of special corps, were engaged. Naval. Naval Programme. The Japanese Government is making strenuous efforts to increase the size and strength of the Navy. The principal warships to be built according to the naval construction programme, which is to be carried out during seven years at a cost of yen 76,500,000, are the following :— Two battleships, one armoured cruiser, two cruisers, three large destroyers, four small destroyers and two submarines.

Besides the above, the following worships have been launched during the year:— The armoured cruiser * Kurama? of 14,620 tons, the most powerful vessel of her class afloat. The Tone, 3rd class cruiser. Three torpedo-boat destroyers. She is expected to prove Communications. Railways. The transfer of the private railways to the State, in accordance with the Bailway Nationalisation Scheme, was completed in October. The total length of lines taken over was 4,370 miles. A comparatively small amount of railway construction has been carried out during the year in Japan itself. The most important railway work is that which is being carried out in the island of Formosa, where the railways w*ill play an important part in opening up the rich resources of the interior. They are also expected to have a very beneficial influence on the pacification of the abori“ ginal inhabitants, and in bringing the island under orderly administration.The following are th .0 principal works which have been undertaken or com pleted during the year An electric railway between Hiranuma and Kozu.

Formosan Railways. A survey has been made for a railway to connect the east and west sides of Taihoku-So-o, the northern portion of Eormosa. The termini are to be Taihoku, the capital, Nortn Forraosa ' which is already connected by rail with Tamsui, and So-o, a small post on the east coast, south of Gilan. The length of the line will he about 50 miles. Half of the line runs through mountainous country inhabited by savages, and railway communication across the island, through the savage country, will be of great importance in completing the pacification of the island. This railway was commenced in 1906, and its construction is intended for Kagi Arizan the purpose of conveying timber from the magnificent cryptomaria forests of Railwa y* Arizan. At present about 9 miles of the line are practically completed, and it is expected that the railway will he finished in three years. This railway which provides through communication from the north to the Keiung-Takow. south of the island is nearing completion. Traffic on the Hozan Eailway between Takow and Kyokyok was opened on Hozan Railway. October 1 st, 1907. Maritime. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha decided to establish a line of steamers between Kobe—An tung, Kobe and An-tung in Manchuria. Three vessels were assigned for the pur pose and sailings commenced on the 16th March. (Eor the Japanese steamships combine formed for the Yang4zu traffic, see China, page 41.) Eesource s. Eegulations have been published in the Official Gazette with reference to the Horse-breeding, encouragement of horse-breeding. The gist of them is that material assistance will be given by the Basei Kyoku or Eemount Department to all associations formed in provincial districts for improving the breed of horses and holding horse-shows. Instructions have also been promulgated with regard to organizing horse-races and forming courses. It is stated that the iTyo&amp;w purchased last year from Australia no less than 15,000 horses, and sold them, together with the animals taken in the war, to people in all parts of the Empire. This is only an instalment of what is ultimately contemplated. From statistics published by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce it appears J a P an,s Foreiga that the foreign trade of Japan has almost doubled during the last seven years.

Internal. laoan'B Work in A summary of Japan’s work in Korea is contained in a report issued by Korea. the Vice-JKesident-General, Mr. Tsumhara. Since the establishment of his office in 1906, he claims to have accomplished the following measures, either partially or completely 1. Improvement of the police system. 2. Establishment of Kesidencies in many towns where Japanese settlers reside. 3. Establishment of law courts where second and final decisions can he obtained. 4 . Legal establishment of Japanese settlers as semi-self-goyerning com* munities in ten or more towns. 5. Improvement of the Japanese system of popular education. As to matters touching Korean Imperial administration, Mr. Tsuruhara claims to have made headway on the following lines :— 1 . Improvement of local administration throughout Korea, by such means as the appointment of efficient local officials, and the strict and equitable management of tax-collection. 2. Commencement of public works, such as the improvement of national banks and the establishment of water-works in Seoul, Chemulplio, etc. 3. The general encouragement of manufacturing industries, e.g.,. the promulgation of placer mining laws, the registration of immigrants, the founding of model farms and industrial works, the preservation and planting of forests, the opening of training institutions for workers in domestic industries. Foreign. Luring the first half of the year the Korean Ministry attempted by intri- Intrigues against g ues with foreign powers to emancipate themselves from Japanese control. To Japanese Control. p U t an end to this, the Japanese dissolved the Ministry at the end of May, and the Eremier, Pak Chee-sun, was replaced by Yi Wan-yong,the Minister for Eoreign Affairs. The latter statesman was understood to be entirely progressive, and to be * persuaded that the country’s only hope lay in working hand in hand with Japan. The remainder of the Cabinet was composed practically of Japanese nominees. The control of the country thus seemed to be settled in Japanese hands more firmly than ever. Early in July, however, an unlooked-for incident occurred. A Korean deputation arrived at the Hague and appealed to the Conference then sit ting for protection from Japan, who was declared to have broken her pledges to preserve the independence of Korea. The President of the Conference declined to receive the deputation. The Emperor, when interrogated by the Resident-General, denied all knowledge of the deputation, but the members of the latter declared that their credentials w'ere signed and sealed by him, though, as he was practi- . cally a prisoner in the hands of the Japanese, he feared to admit the truth. Emperor? 11 ° the The Japanese authorities at once took steps to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents. Pressure was brought upon the Emperor to induce him to abdicate, and on the 19th July he did so in favour of his son, who was only eleven years old.Subsequent to the abdication of the Emperor a new convention was con-^ lu c ; n “ ent f ion eluded on July 25th at Seoul between Japan and Korea. By this convention, although the portfolios of State and other principal posts remained nominally in Korean hands, most of the secondary posts—Vice-Ministers of Departments, Heads of Bureaux, Provincial Inspectors, and local Heads of Police—were filled by Japanese, and practically the whole supreme control of the Administration was vested in the Japanese Besident-General. ^ ^ The abdication of the Emperor raised the excitement of the populace, who the Army, were devoted to the Royal House, to the highest pitch. The Ministry resigned, many of the Korean troops mutinied, and serious riots took place during which the houses of the Cabinet Ministers were attacked and burned by the mob. Japanese troops were hurried in from Japan and from the out-lying districts, and on the 31st July an ordnance w r as promulgated disbanding the Korean army, the men being granted one year’s pay. Japanese columns were sent out to suppress those of the Korean troops that still held out, and by the close of the year order had been more or less restored. A dispute has arisen between China and Japan regarding the region Di iP^®^ arding Chien-tao, on the north-east frontier, which the former country claims as Manchurian territory, while the latter declares it to he an integral portion of Korea. The question is at present the subject of negotiation between the two governments, and meanwhile small parties of troops of both countries are occupying various points in the disputed territory. A company, called the Oriental Colonization Company, has been started The Orientei Cob; for the purpose of developing Korea’s resources. In view of the fact that Japan^s p a z n a y lon population in Korea is increasing by 600,000 annually, the latter country s prolific granary is of immense importance to Japan. Military. The present Japanese garrison of Korea consists of about a division. Japanese Garrison. Hitherto these troops have been concentrated mainly in .the direction of the northern frontier, but it is stated that a change of policy is contemplated, and that in future the force will be distributed in the south in numerous smail detachments. The Imperial Rescript of 31st July disbanding the Korean Army stated The Korean Army. “ that whereas our existing army, which is composed of mercenaries, is unfit for purposes of national defence, which must he conducted by the united efforts of the whole people, it is our intention to remodel our military system, and direct attention for the present principally to the training of officers, with a view _ to the eventual formation of an efficient army by the enactment of a conscription laW ’’ Naval. Important works are being constructed in Chin-hai Bay with a view to Naval Base at making it a base for the Japanese fleet, and converting it into the finest naval station in the Ear East. Communications. It has been decided to build a bridge oyer the Yalu from New Wiju to Bridging ot Yon&lt;rampbo. New Wiju is 10 miles down-stream from the original Wiju, “ * a u - and lies near An-tung. The road-bed will be 40 feet aboye the water, and the length of the bridge will be 3,239 feet. The bridge is expected to be ready for use in 1909, MALAY PENINSULA.

From 1st April 1907 a permanent reduction was made in tlie garrison of the colony of 3 officers and 96 men in the European artillery, and two officers and 100 men in the Native Artillery. Pdr contra the strength of the European infantry battalion was increased by 74 men, so that the net reduc tion m the garrison of the colony amounted to 5 officers and 122 men. Government sanctioned the formation of a Volunteer Corps of Guides in Singapore. The object of the corps is to form an intelligence staff to assist the military in time of war. The corps is to be recruited from Europeans of un mixed British parentage. Members must possess a knowledge of a portion of the Island of Singapore ; have a knowledge of local dialects ; and provide their own means of getting about the country. The strength of the Malay States Guides on 1 st January was 13 European officers and 850 rank and file. The strength of the Straits Settlements Police force on the same date was 96 Europeans and Eurasians and 2,131 Malays, Chinese and Indians. Communications. Railways, The mileage at present open amounts to 428 miles. The Government has sanctioned 6,000 dollars for the survey of a proposed line through Bukit Metajam into Kedah.

It having been recognised, however, that, unless this prohibition was rescinded, the maintenance of a Gurkha reserve of sufficient strength would be impossible, the question was discussed by Lord Kitchener and the Prime Minis ter during tbe former’s visit to Nepal, in the autumn of 1906. Sir Chandra Shamsher Jang expressed himself as quite willing to agree to the proposal that reservists should be permitted to reside in Nepal territory ; but wished the scheme to be regarded as experimental for the next two years, so that after practical experience the Government of India and the Nepal Durbar might be able to judge of its merits, and consider whether the number of the reserve should be increased. In connection with the reservist scheme, the Resident in Nepal reported during the year that two cases had occurred of reservists enlisting in the Nepal army without reporting the fact that they were members of the Reserve. To prevent this, the Prime Minister proposed that the Nepal Durbar should be furnished every six months with descriptive rolls of all Gurkha sepoys who had joined the Reserve. The Government of India agreed to the proposal.

The operations against rebel native chiefs in the Celebes continued operations throughout the year. A considerable amount of fighting has taken place, hut in though the Dutch have been successful in all the encounters reported, the insurrection shows no signs yet of having been effectively stamped out. In April, the Dutch troops attacked a rocky position occupied by the rebels and inflicted a loss on the latter of 280 killed, among whom were several leaders of the rebellion. In May, a rebel band was surprised at Karsa by Dutch troops. The casualties of the latter were one European and six native The rebel leader and fourteen of his adherents were killed, while thirteen were taken prisoner. In August, a Dutch column attacked and occupied Tindenga, the centre right-hand man of the Prime Minister, died in June. Sliamslier, Trade.

Thus the Siamese Government cedes to France the provinces of Battambong, Siamreap (including Ankor), and Sisophon, and the French Government cedes to Siam Danzai and the province of Krat, and the adjacent islands. Secondly, the treaty makes important modifications in the system of ex-ter ritoriality of Irench Asiatic subjects and proteges, in return for their having equal rights with Siamese subjects in the holding of property. All French Asiatic subjects will, subsequent to the signing of the treaty, be subject to the jurisdiction of ordinary Siamese Courts. As regards the holding of property and payment of taxes, all Asiatic subjects of France will be in the same position as Siamese subjects. Communications. Railways.

The Nord Deutscher Lloyd Company hare recently received permission to st f t f 0 ' n man at Cra £”! erect upon the small island of Koh Kham, a residence for their Kuropean Kham. employes engaged in supervising the transfer of coal to their fleet of vessels. Koh Kham lies north of the island of Koh Sichang. from which it is separated by a strait, about miles broad. The permission is believed to be carefully worded, so as to exclude a claim being raised in the future by the Germans to actual ownership of any portion of the island. The coaling station enables vessels plying between Singapore and Bangkok to load sufficient coal to last for the half trip only, instead of being compelled to ship sufficient coal at Singapore to last for the round trip. The result is that a proportionately greater amount of cargo can be carried. King Chulalongkorn paid a visit of several months’ duration to Europe t0 ^ 0 ^ n2,sVlsit and was everywhere cordially received. Military, Under the re-organisation scheme which is now being carried into effect, ti 0 n rmy 0r £ an * za * the army is to consist of 10 territorial divisions, or what we should call mixed brigades. Of these, a few are complete, some in a more or less advanced stage of organisation, and one or two still awaiting formation. The normal division consists of 2 regiments of infantry, a regiment of cavalry, a brigade of artillery, a company of engineers and a transport company. The scheme further contem plates the grouping of divisions into larger commands, as follows : (1) The Metropolitan Command—to consist of the 1st (Bangkok), 2nd (Nakon Chaisa), and 3rd (Ayouthia) Divisions. (2) The Eastern Command—to consist of the 5th (Korat), 9th (Pekim), and 10th (Oubon and Tsan) Divisions. (3) The Northern Command—to consist of the 16th (Nakan Sawan), 7th (Pitsanulok), and 8 th (Payab) Divisions. (4th) The Western Command—to consist of the 4th (Bat Bouri) Divi sion and a division to be formed in the Malay States at some future date. The present total peace strength of the army is approximately as follows, Present strength, exclusive of officers and non-commissioned officers :—• Infantry, 23 battalions ... ••• ••• 9,200 men Cavalry, 6 squadrons... ... ... ••• » Artillery, 16 batteries... ... »•» 1,600 „ (with 32 Krupp 5 c.m. mountain guns and 32 old bronze mountain guns).

Another project is a line from Trang on the west coast to Patalung, with branches to Singora and Lakhon Sri Tammarat. The total length of this line would be about 155 miles and the cost about £800,000. The principal aim of the British Government with regard to both these lines is to keep them free from German influence, and to secure the employment of British capital in their construction. Negotiations with this end are proceed ing between the British and Siamese Governments. Bangkok-Patriu. It is intended to open the Bangkok-Patriu line, if possible, at the begin ning of 1908.

Dr. Albert Tafel, the German traveller, made some explorations in eastern Dr - AIbert Ta ^ 1 Tibet, and an Englishman, Mr. J. W. Brooke, entered Tibet from the north-east Brooke? r ‘ J ' with the intention of exploring the country south-east of Chetang. Political. Internal. Considerable friction appeared to exist during the early part of the year Relations b0t * between theTashi Lama and the Lhasa Government, attributable to the former’s and friendly relations with the British. The Chinese representative, Mr. Chang, Lhasa Gov- did his best to induce the Tashi Lama to ally himself with the anti-British party eiIlmen • in Lhasa, and even issued instructions to him debarring him from any direct relations with the British. There are reported to be two factions in Lhasa; on one side is the Ti- Factions in Lha- Bimpoche and the three lay Shapes who are in favour of keeping on good terms sa * with the British, as far as practicable having regard to the orders of the Chinese. The other party consists of theTeling Depon, the Kalon Lama (or Monk Shape) and many influential Lamas who are hostile to us. Mr. Chang advised all Tibetans to settle their differences in order to be able to resist any influence which we might bring to bear upon one party if the Tibetans were divided. At a recent meeting of the National Assembly in Lhasa it was decided to The Dalai Lama, recall the Dalai Lama. According to the latest information the Lama had not on the 1st November left Hsining, but it was subsequently reported that he was proceeding to Wutaishan in Skan-si with the permission of the Emperor of China. Foreign. The attitude of the Chinese in Tibet has been consistently obstructive and Attitude of the unaccommodating. Mr. Chang, the Chinese representative, and his subordin- Tibet . 89 ate Mr. Gow, the Chinese Commissioner in charge of the Chinese Trade and Diplomatic Agency, from the time of their appointment in Tibet adopted a policy of exclusiveness, and attempted by every means at their disposal to undermine British influence with the Tibetans. Early in January, Mr. Chang gave orders that all dealings between the British and Tibetans at Gyantse were to be conducted through the medium of Mr. Gow, with the result that commu nication between Captain O’Connor, the Trade Agent, and the local officials was almost completely stopped. Mr. Gow also threatened to stop supplies being furnished by Tibetans to Captain O’Connor, unless paid for at rates to be fixed by him. Not content with heaping petty indignities on the Trade Agent in a variety of ways calculated to cause him to be regarded as a nonentity by the Tibetans, whose relations with the British had hitherto been both respectful and friendly, Mr. Chang proceeded to carry out a policy showing contempt for the Indian Government and disregard for the stipulations of the Convention of 1904. The unfriendliness and hostility exhibited by the Chinese authorities were exemplified by the harsh treatment of all Chinese and Tibetan officials who had been principally connected with the improvement in the relations between the British and the Tibetans, while a consistent opponent of British interests, such as the Teling Depon, was raised to a position of great power and influence in Lhasa. As examples of the rancour displayed towards pro-British officials may be instanced the discourteous treatment of the Tashi Lama, the degradation and imprisonment of the Amban Yu Tai, and the punishment of various other Chinese officials who had promoted friendly relations with the British. A representation on the subject was made by the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government, who replied that they were agreed as to the necessity of maintaining the privileges secured to Great Britain by the Lhasa and Peking Conventions, but pointed out that the principle had been recognised in the negotiations with Russia that His Majesty’s Government were precluded by the terms of the Convention from interfering with the action of China in Tibet or with the relations of the Lhasa Government with the Tashi Lama, provided nothing was done by the Chinese or Tibetan authorities to impair those privileg. es. With regard to various other matters complained of, the Indian Government was informed tnat steps had been taken to arrive at a settlement by communi cating directly with the Chinese Government on the subject through theBritish Minister £it JPehing. The situation, however, ciid not improve, cind on the 27th June, Sir E. Grey telegraphed to Sir J. Jordan, pointing out that the local officials in Tibet were not obeying the orders of the Chinese Government and instructing him to make a very serious representation to the latter on the subject. Sir J. Jordan was also requested to inform the Chinese Government that flis Majesty’s Government might have to cancel the arrangement by which they allowed China to pay the indemnity. The removal of Mr. Gow from employment in Tibet was also suggested. In conclusion, Sir J. Jordan was informed that Government were prepared to consider the means of making China take a serious view of all her obligations to Great Britain, if he could sug* gest any action which might have the desired effect. r lhese representations had the effect of causing the Chinese Government to recall Mr. Gow from Gyantse, but no further developments had taken place up to the close of the year.

Revision of the Negotiations regarding ttte Trade Regulations, after protracted correspon- Trade Beguia- J eiice) we re commenced at Simla towards the end of August, soon after the arrival of Mr. Chang, the Chinese Commissioner, and the Tibetan delegate, the Tsarong Shape, in August. The formal meeting to open the negotiations was held on the 12 th September between Sir L. Dane, the British Commissioner, Mr. Chang, and the Tsarong Shape. The Tibetan delegate’s credentials were found to be unsatis factory, audit was decided that they should be returned to Lhasa for amendment. Meanwhile, it was arranged to continue the negotiations. A deadlock, however, was reached owing to a difficulty connected with the status of the Tsarong Shape. Mr. Chang insisted that the Shape was appointed by the Chinese Emperor, not by Tibet, and claimed that the negotiations were really being con ducted between the British and Chinese Governments, Tibet having no voice in the matter, except through China. He claimed, in fact, on behalf of China, sovereignty as well as suzerainty over Tibet, and full administrative authority in Tibet. The position was described to Sir J. Jordan, who, on the 12th November, reported that the Wai-wu Pu were prepared to agree to the Shape being described in the preamble to the Regulations as appointed by the Tibetan authorities, and to his assisting in the negotiations, but they considered it derogatory to China that the Regulations should be signed by him. On the 17th December the Government of India informed the Secretary of State that they considered that the Shape’s signature to the Regulations was essential. With regard to the ratification of the Regulations the Government of India pointed out that it would probably be impossible to secure ratification at Lhasa, and therefore recommended that there should he no ratification at London and Peking, which would only have the effect of strengthening the Chinese claim to sovereignty over Tibet. tween Great Brit- # A convention between Great Britain and Russia respecing Tibet was am and Russia signed on the 31st August 1907. respecting Tibet. ^ ° It consists of five articles, of which the provisions may he summed up as follows ( 1 ) Both Governments agree to abstain from all interference with the internal administration of Tibet. (2) The suzerainty of China over Tibet is acknowledged, and any negotiations with Tibet must he conducted through the inter mediary of the Chinese Government. This engagement does not, however, exclude the relations of British Commercial Agents with the Tibetan authorities, as provided for in the Conventions of 1901 and 1906 with Tibet and China respectively. Both British and Russian Buddhist subjects may enter into relations with the representatives of Buddhism in Tibet, but such relations are to be confined to strictly religious matters. (&lt;&gt;) Both Governments engage not to send a representative to Lhasa. (4) No concessions lor railways, mining, or other rights will he sought or obtained by either Great Britain or Russia.(5) No Tibetan revenues whether in kind or in cash shall be pledged or assigned to either Great Britain or Russia. In addition to the above, Great Britain reaffirms the declaration by which she agrees to evacuate the Chumbi valley, provided the terms of the Convention of 1904 have been complied with in all respects. A proposal to prohibit scientific missions to Tibet for a period of three years has also been agreed to by the British and Russian Governments. The district of Batang in Eastern Tibet is to be henceforth administered by Assumption by Chinese officials, and the Batang tribesmen -will be considered to be 9 h!llese AdmwL'atiOB of subiects. The Viceroy of Ssu-ch’uan is making great efforts to induce Chinamen Batang, to emigrate into and colonise the district, but according to accounts from Mr. Eox, Acting Consul-General at Cheng-tu, and Mr. Edgar of the China Inland Mission, there does not appear much prospect of the colonisation scheme turning out a success.

Political- Accession of Shah. Rebellion of Salar-ud-Dauleh. (Internal.) The late Shah Muzaffar-ud-Din died on the 8 th January 1907, and was succeeded by his son Muhammad Ali, the Yali Ahd, who had been acting as Regent since the 16th December 1906, when the late Shah’s health necessitat ed the appointment of a Regency. On the 11th January the Heir apparent was proclaimed Shah by the Grand Yazir, Ministers, Princes and others, and ascended the throne without opposition. The Shah’s brother Salar-ud-Dauleh was dismissed from the governorship of Arabistan in March; but showed no intention of giving up his post, and shortly after rebelled. He had married a daughter of the Yali of Pusht-i- Kuh, and evidently relied upon the support of his father-in-law. In May he is reported to have had a following of 25,000 tribesmen in the vicinity of Kirmanshah, and on the 16th he applied to His Majesty’s Consul at that place to effect a reconciliation with the Shah. On the 18th the Shah gave an assurance of pardon and safety to the Salar, who asked to be maintained as Governor of Arabistan, etc., as he preferred to die fighting rather than to be poisoned by the Shah. As he refused to come in imperial troops were despatch ed to break up the prince’s following, and a skirmish took place on the 8 th June outside Nahavand, after which the Salar retired. Eventually, on the 18th, accompanied by one attendant alone, he took refuge in the British Consulate at Kirmanshah, and on the 22nd June he was handed over to the Zahir-ud-Dauleh, and shortly after taken to Tehran. On the 30th December 1906 the Constitution was signed by the late Shah. It was then sealed by the Yali Ahd (the present Shah) and the Sadr Azam and delivered to the Assembly on the 1 st January 1907. The National Assembly had been the absorbing topic of interest during the previous month. It was not long, however, before the new Shah and the Assembly came into conflict, and about the 10th Pebruary the Assembly sent an ultimatum to tbe Shah demanding the dismissal of M. Naus, the Belgian Director of Persian Customs (to whom the Shah, alarmed at the situation in Tehran, had applied for an advance of pay for his troops) and his chief assistants. The Assembly also required formal recognition from the Shah that the monarchy was limited and the Ministers responsible to the Chamber. The Shah agreed to the first demand; hut wished to compromise as regards the others. The situation became strained and it was anticipated that His Majesty might appeal for help from outside; hut on the 11th February he formally accepted the demands of the people, and the difficulties were regarded as settled. At this time the British and Russian Governments discussed the question of demonstrations in the event of an anti-foreign movement declaring itself in Persia, and it was agreed that for physical reasons that of the British must be confined to the ports. Early in March the Minister at Tehran reported that a prominent sup porter of the Assembly had been murderously assualted at Tabriz, and that the Shah had brought in some men from that place. It was feared that the Shah was contemplating an attack on the Assembly, and he was said to be counting upon Bussian support in the event of the attack failing. It was believed also that promises of help had been given at Tabriz and Meshed and that the Shah was expected to look after Tehran—a strong Bussian force was reported as being maintained on the Tabriz frontier, and the Bussian Consular guards at Tehran, Urumia, and Tabriz were reported to be increased by 20, 11, and 19, Cossacks respectively, whereas formerly there bad been 2 at Urumia and 5 at Tabriz. Later, the news of the arrival of 40 Russian Cossacks at Tehran, and of detach ments in Khorasan and Mazandaran caused great excitement in tbe capital. The National guard in Tehran had been dissolved by order of the Chief Priests, and the Assembly had taken an oath of allegiance to the Shah and the Constitution.On tlie 17th March the Grand Vazir was dismissed, and it was reported that with the consent of Russia the Amin-us-Sultan had been summoned to Tehran, but had refused to return. On the 22nd April, however, it was announced that he had arrived at Enzeli on board a Russian ship; but until the Tehran Assembly telegraphed their permission he had not been allowed to land. He arrived at Tehran, after nearly four years’ absence, on the 26th April, and was formally appointed President of the Council of Ministers and Minister of the Interior on the 2nd May. He proceeded to the National Assembly, accompained by his whole cabinet, and made a statement of policy on May 4th. On the 7 th May the Shah expressed to His Majesty’s Minister, in the course of an interview, that a good understanding between himself and his people was the best policy for both. But on the 26th a violent popular demonstration took place as the result of an announcement made in the Tehran Assembly that the Shah had sent servants to murder members of the Tabriz Assembly and had commissioned a robber chief to attack Tabriz. The excitement only subsided when, after considerable pressure, the Shah consented to the arrest of the persons incriminated. Mutual distrust between the Assembly and the Shah was the result of this episode, and the conviction rapidly grew that the Shah was working against the Assembly and was acting under Russian advice. His policy seemed to be, to promote general disorder throughout the country, and throw the blame on the popular leaders. He hoped when the Assembly was weakened to obtain their consent to a large foreign loan, and counted on Russian intervention in case of failure of his plans. To this end he appears to have subsidised a faction headed by some promin ent Mullas, including the Mujtahid Shaikh Fazlullah, and the head of the Saiyids, Nakid-us-Saadat, who displayed considerable activity hostile to the National Assembly. Sir C. Spring-Rice in consequence spoke seriously to His Majesty on the personal danger to himself, and the necessity for an understand ing with the Assembly, early in July, and similar language was used by the Russian Minister. On the 25th July, the anniversary of the granting by the late Shah of the rescript dated August 5th, 1906, authorizing the institution of the National Assembly, a national celebration was held at the place of the Assembly, the pro ceedings being marked with extraordinary enthusiasm. It had done nothing up to this time of any practical value, its debates were disorderly and no decisions were come to. It was felt, therefore, that unless it could do some definite work it would lose the confidence of the people : and as it was impossible to carry out any measure of reform without the co-operation or submission of the Shah, it was decided to send a deputation praying the Shah to show bis confi dence in the popular representations, and to afford them his cordial and sincere support in the work of saving the nation. The deputation was received by the Shah on the 19th August and was assured of his desire to co-operate in reforms. His Majesty expressed the opinion that the army must be re-organised at once, and that the employment of foreign instructors was necessary. The Atabeg-i-Azam (Amin-ns-Soltan) at this time was said to be in a state of great depression, afraid of his life, distrustful of the Shah, and anxious to resign. Although useful as a man holding a middle position between the Shah and the people, he was incapable of organising or administering a Gov ernment or of carrying out any thorough-going reform. His one idea appeared to be to get possession of a sum of ready money to tide over present difficulties ; hut before he could carry out this design he was shot and killed on the 31st August as he was leaving the Assembly. One of his assailants committed suicide after killing a soldier, who tried to seize him, and the other man was captured, and subsequently executed. The day before his death the Atabeg had told Sir C. Spring-Rice that a determined effort had been made by the reactionaries to oust him from office,66 but had been defeated. He was confident of success, as he had a lar^e pro. portion of the Assembly with him. His murder looked like a revolutionary crime, but his family suspected certain important persons. On the day of his death the Atabeg and his Ministers had resigned, but consented to withdraw their resignations on the receipt of a formal pledge from the Shah that he would not oppose the Assembly. The crime was apparently not condemned by popular sentiment at Tehran. The whole Cabinet w'as recast; hut the Mushir-ud-Dauleh refused office, and died very suddenly on the evening of September 13th. In him the popular party had confidence, and reports of foul play were immediately spread. The President of the Assembly, Sani-ud-Dauleh, resigned immediately after the murder of the Atabeg, as he considered it was the result of a con spiracy in which his great enemy, Saad-ud-Dauleh, was concerned. He was succeeded by Ihtesham-us-Sultaneh on the 10th September. Ihis official had but lately returned from Mosul, where he w as serving as Boundary Commis sioner in connection with the Turco-Persian frontier dispute. On the 27th September the Princes and civil and military officials of note, who had up till then formed the reactionary party, presented an ultimatum to the Shah, declaring their adhesion to the Constitution and National Assembly, and threatening to sever all connection with the Throne, should His Majesty not co operate with the National Party. Sir C. Spring Rice, who was proceeding home on leave, had a farew ell audience of the Shah the following day, when he presented Mr. Marling, the Charge d’Affaires, and found His Majesty in a very bad humour. On the 2 nd October the Assembly gained a victory over the Shabby insist ing on the dismissal of the Saad-ud-Dauleb, who had been appointed Minister of Poreign Affairs. Ala-us-Sultaneh was re-appointed Foreign Minister in his place. By this, and the passing of additional articles of the Convention, the Assembly enforced its right to demand the dismissal of objectionable Ministers, and showed that it meant to be independent of clerical control. On the 26th October a new Cabinet was formed by the National Assembly and approved by the Shah. All the members w ith one exception were highly educated Persians of the modern school, each knowing one or two European languages. The Shah attended by a numerous suite went for the first time to the Assembly on the afternoon of the 12 th November. Every precaution was taken for his safety, and after expressing his satisfaction at the labours of Paliament, he took the prescribed oath. The proceedings only lasted half an hour, and the Shah was well received both in the Assemby and in the streets. By the 7th December the political situation had again become strained, as the Shah appeared to be preparing a coup d'etat wdth the assistance of the reactionaries. The position of the Prime Minister had been rendered almost intolerable by their campaign against him. Violent speeches were made on the 10th at a popular meeting, in which the Shah was denounced as having sold himself to Russia. An excited crowd gathered outside the Assembly building, but w r as dispersed by armed men sent by the Shah. The Ministry had resign ed, but the Shah refused to accept their resignation. Later, on the same day, the Shah arrested the Ala-ud-Dauleh, and his brother, the President of the Assembly, who had been sent to carry a message to him from the Assembly. The Shah sent for the Prime Minister at 5 o’clock, put him in chains, and threatened to kill him that nisht. The latter had always been a great friend or the British, and Mr. Marling sent a messenger to the palace to demand assurances for his safety, and proposed going to the palace himself if he did not get the assurance. On the 16th the bazars were all closed and the principal square occupied by armed partisans of the Shah. The Assembly dispersed on the arrest of the Nasr-ul-Mulk, who was subse quently released on Mr. Mailing’s demand; but he had been exiled and was1 raving for 'Rasht. The SLnil's coup seemed to be successful, due entirely to the assurance of Russian support. The same day, however, the Assembly sat without opposition from the Shah, and large numbers of their members were guarding it, armed. In reply to a deputation the Shah advised the Assembly to adjourn wdiilst he restored order. His message was received with contempt, and violent speeches were made against His Majesty. Next day more armed ruffians were brought into the town by order of the Shah, and they assembled in the cannon square with Cossacks and Artillery in support. A partisan of the Assembly had been murdered, and a constitutionist murderously assaulted. On the 18th the Political Committees were still guard ing the Assembly building, and the Shah’s party remained in possession of the square. The previous night the Shah had conceded the Assembly’s demands, but had not removed his ruffians, who were provoking disorders. Mr. Marling then asked the Hussian Minister to join with him in requesting the Shah to remove his hooligans who were a danger to Europeans. On the 19th the Shah’s partisans dispersed, and permission had been granted to Nasr-ul-Mulk and Ala-ud-Dauleh to return to Tehran. Meanwhile, parties from Rasht and Tabriz were reported to be leaving for Tehran to support the popular party, and on the 21 st Mr. Marling telegraphed there was a strong movement on foot, supported by the Zill-us-Sultan, to dethrone the Shah. The position appeared most critical and it was feared an attempt would be made on the Shah’s life. That afternoon the Trench, Pussian, and British Ministers met and decided to obtain assurances next day from the Shah that he had no intention of abolishing the constitution, to inform the Assembly when these assurances w^ere obtained, and to warn the Zill-us-Sultan that his designs on the Throne could not be tolerated. On the 22nd the Shah granted all the demands made by the Assembly; but further conditions were formulated before they would accept His Majesty’s oath ; and on the 24th Mr. Marling regarded the situation as big with danger, as the assassination and dethronement of the Shah were being openly discussed. The interference of the German Charge d’Affaires had complicated and largely neutralised the influence of the British and Russian Ministers, who were unable to persuade the Assembly to receive the declaration of the pledges the Shah had made to them on the 22 nd. On the 26th, however, Mr. Marling was able to report that the situation had greatly improved and the bazars had re-opened. The Shah had been thoroughly frightened, and the Russian Minister, it was thought, greatly regretted having allowed him to believe that he was certain of Russian support. So the year closed, but with the shifty and false character of the Shah it is impossible to count upon his not indulging in some provocative action, which will again bring him into serious conflict with the Assembly. The state of disorder as recorded above in the capital itself appears to have reacted on all parts of Persia ; and during the year under review disturbances have been general at nearly all the large centres; whilst the safety of the various important trade routes have been greatly imperilled by bands of brigands w ho were free to rob and molest caravans and travellers, with little fear of interference at the hands of the central government, who were powerless to take any action to preserve order in the country. It is proposed now to touch briefly on these disturbances and political events at various centres. Early in the year there was some ferment in Tabriz owing to the action taken by a self-appointed Assembly calling itself the Anjaman, wdiich showed hostility to Nizam-ul-Mulk, the Governor; while the people manifested a firm intention not to submit again to the old bad system of government. A similar situation prevailed at Urumia where the local ‘ Anjuman ’ had the government entirely in their own hands. r l he state of insecurity in the frontier districts was so bad that the postal service between Tabriz, Khoi and Urumia had to be indefinitely suspended. There was civil w ar between the Kurds of Tergavar and Margavar resulting in the slaughter of some scores of them. Genera! tion in AzerbaijanA military expedition was sent by the Persian Government against the Kurds of Bend on the 5th January and destroyed that village ; but the Kurds returning later killed a dozen of the baser inhabitants of Urumia, who had proceeded to the village to plunder and carry off everything portable, and the feelings between the Shiahs and Sunnis of that district became very bitter. In February the Kurds murdered a German subject, Herr Dammann, and robbed and ill-treated some German missionaries at Suj Bulak. At the end of the month, by order of the Anjuman, some 90 ca^es of arms and ammunition destined for the Shah were seized, which led to an altercation between the Eussian Consul-General and the Governor. Public feeling ran high and a general boycott of Eussian goods was threatened, the indignation being still further increased by the addition to the Cossack guard at the Eussian Consulate in March. Persons who arrived at Tabriz about the end of April reported that there was a large gathering of Eussian Cossacks a day’s journey east of Julfa on the frontier. During May the situation at Tabriz bad become more critical, the Governor resigning on the 6 th as he found his position untenable. He was induced, however, to return on the 10th. The local Assembly telegraphed on the loth to the Tehran National Assembly that the country was tired of waiting for a con stitutional Government and that the bazars would remain closed until the fund amental law was promulgated. As no satisfactory reply was received they threatened that if not promulgated within 10 days a special law would be made locally for Azarbaijan. I he bazars were closed during the last half of May, and the town was practically in a state of siege. At night the streets were patrolled by bodies of armed men in the service of the local Assembly. On the 31st three men entered the telegraph office with the intention of assassinating certain members of the local Assembly which held its sittings there. One of them was shot and the others beaten, when they confessed they had been bribed by one of the Shah’s attendants to murder the leading members of the Assembly. Eahim Khan, the robber chief previously alluded to, had sent his son towards la Wiz with a considerable force, and on the 25tii May a letter was intercepted from him to the Governor saying he was ready to carry off the local Assembly to lehran it he got the word. r lhe Governor was placed under arrest, and the matter taken up by the Tehran Assembly with the result previously stated. ie (i&gt; uibances terminated about the 5th June when a scarcity of bread ensued, and a not took place during which one of the richest merchants of the place was beaten to death as he was supposed to have made a corner in wheat. There was cotisii em e excitement for a time and the owners of wheat contemplated dissuaded^ m ^ ^ Jri ^ ls ^ 1 ^ onsu ^ a ^ e i from which they were eventually fr ^1Zt n r were ^P° rted at a® end of May from Maku, a town and dis- nelled tlipiv n ° r T T' 63 * c 0 l ’ n 01 'Azarbaijan, where the populace ex- w I - Later &gt; freaks occurred at Zanjan and Ardabil, at early in Tnlv ''n't!'

SIn September Mr. Wratislaw, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz, was despatched to Crumia to watch events on the frontier in connection with the encroachments of the Turks, who since June had shewn considerable activity in pushing forward to, and occupying, districts to the east of the neutral zone (see Turkey-in* Asia). Durin 0 * October a large number of revolutionaries of Khoi marched into the Maku district intending to kill the Governor. He, however, attacked and defeated them, killing, it is said, iOO. A commission sent there failed to settle the disnute and the district of Khoi remained disturbed, with the result that British trade suffered owing to the blocking of the roads by the Governor. In Tabriz the Governor appeared to be giving the Revolutionaries a free hand iustice being administered even in cases of murder by the local Assembly. He left in the middle of December for Suj Bulak in connection with a reported Kurdish insurrection, and soon found himself in difficulties. Towards the end of the year armed men endeavoured on more than one to force their way into the Russian Consulate, one of whom adinitte that^is purpose was*tokHl the Russian Consul-General, The Russian Govern, ment in reply to his request for further protection decided to send an exha Siard of 25 Cossacks to Tabriz and to keep a force of *00 men ready on the frontier! At the close of the year the Russian guard consequently consisted of 50 Cossacks at Tabriz. , . ^ The Reform movement was strong at Resht, and was influenced bya powerful association at Baku calling themselves “ Declavi, ^ numbering from ? non +n 5 000 persons The name (literally “ sacrifice ) is significant, as it is the^same^as^haTadopted by the historical Persian “assassins.” associations in Resht, one public and one secret, admission into the latt r quiringmauy formalities and pledges not to reveal what takes place at h wop+i’nox? and to do awav with any one who should break his pledge. 1 attitude was distinctly revolutionary and gave some anxiety at Tehran. 0^ the occasion of the festivites in connection with the Shah’s coronation, the mb tants refused to take part without orders from the lehran Assemb y.

Ten Cossacks accompanied Persian sent subsequently from Turbatn-Iiai ari, ^ t Meshedi apparently Cossacks were despatched from lehran. iue munaa Eesht. Khorasan70 approved the murder and threatened to wipe out the Russians at that place if strong action were taken at Sabzawar. The incident was finally closed by the arrest of 13 guilty persons, two of whom were condemned to death, but were subsequently commuted from the death penalty at the instance of the Russian Legation. In April local councils were formed both at Turbat and Turshiz. The new Governor-General arrived at Meshed on the 20th May, and was reported to have treated the local Assembly with much respect, and to have appointed a representative to attend its meetings. In October it was reported that lawlessness in Meshed was increasing to a disquieting extent. Murders were of almost daily occurrence, and indecent assaults on women, girls and boys of painful frequency. On the 6 th November information was received that a band of Persian Turkomans from the Atrek were pillaging the districts between M iandaslit and Mazinan near Abbasabad on the Meshed-Tehran road, and had killed and wounded a large number of people in addition to carrying off a quantity of loot. The reports originally received appear to have been greatly exaggerated • but the effect of the raid was to throw Khorasan into a state of much° unrest* and great indignation existed at Meshed against the Government officials for not promptly despatching troops against the raiders. These feelings were in creased on the arrival of refugees from the Bujnurd district with tales of woe caused by the Turkoman invasion, and the assassination of the Governor-Gen eral and other officials was openly discussed. On the 22 nd December Major Sykes telegraped that the telegraph office had been taken charge of by the popular party, who, however, allowed the British telegraph signallers to work ; and that the other Government offices had been closed. The next day the Assembly took charge of the arsenal* but the postal service, as far as foreign subjects were concerned, was allowed to continue under their supervision. Both the local Government officials and the Assembly had hitherto maintained order and avoided bloodshed. In connection with the plague riots which had occurred in Sistan earlv in 1906, His Majesty’s Government agreed to close the incident on payment by the Persian Government of a sum of £ 100 as compensation, an apology, and on condition that land required for the extension of the Consulate Hospital was sold to the Consulate at a nominal price. The Persian Government formally accepted this arrangement, with which they complied in full on the 2 nd Apriri907. Early in January the question of the Governorship of Sistan came to the fore, the Russians apparently supporting the Hashmat-ul-Mulk against the Mumtahin-us-Sultaneh, who was about to be appointed Governor. In Pebruary the Hashmat was also reported to be trying to obtain the Governorship of Kain, held by his half-brother the Shaukat, by purchase * and m April it was said he had been successful, the purchase money being guaranteed by the Russian Minister. Later, it was stated the Assemblv would not consent to the Hashmat’s appointment. ^ His son, Mir Masum Khan, who was Deputy Governor of Sistan, and was credited with a leaning towards the British, was dismissed in February and the elder brother Muhammad Itiza Khan was appointed in his place. During June the Hashmat’s supporters in Birjand and Kain carried on an agitation m his favor hut without success : and the Shaukat appears to have been squeezed too for funds, which compelled him to apply to the branch of the Imperial Bank. In July it was announced that there was no intention on the part ot the Persian Government to remove the Shaukat. Although little interest was taken during the earlier half of the year in matters relating to popular representation in the Kain and Sistan district, in July the leading Mullas of Sistan sent a telegram to the Tehran Assembly,■wliich showed that an attempt was being made to form a local issemblr an,! that the usual antagonistic parties bad been formed. The movement seemed to be confined to the clerical party and was opposed by the Deputy Governor who, however, later withdi'ew liis opposition. J * Early in August information was received that a party of sowars of the Meshed escort returning to India on relief, had, a few days before, been assaulted by customs employes at the Lab-i Baring W; and that a partv“ e u empioyed by Pasand Khan, the contractor on the postal line between Sistan and Kuh-i-Mahk Slab, had delayed the sowars at the edge of the Hamun by prevent ing the boatmen from ferrying the party across the lake. The assault was not of a serious nature, but on previous occasions British subjects had been treated with incivility at that place. Hie customs authorities attempted to bring counter charges of wounding with lances against the sowars ; hut as they had no lances it was easily shown these were fabrications. Strong representations were made by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to the Persian Government with the result that M. Duhem, the Director of Customs in Sistan, who had shown him self consistently unfriendly to the British, was removed from his post, and succeeded by M. Mornard. Towards the end of October the Sistan Local Assembly got up a demons tration against the Deputy Governor, whom they wished to replace by his brother, Mir Masum Khan, as they believed the former opposed them A riotous* crowd besieged the telegraph office and then took bast in the Russian Consulate, where they were fed for some time, during the absence of His Majesty's Consul who was tonring. Major Kennion suspected the agitation had the support of the Russian Consul, and asked for the support of His Majesty’s Legation on behalf of Muhammad Biza Khan. Ultimately the two Consuls, under instructions from their respective Ministers, came to an understanding, and decided that the situation would be calmed if orders were sent to the Deputy Governor to attend to the recommendations of the Assembly. In Pebruary it was reported that a local Assembly had been formed at Firman. Prince Eirman Eirma, who was appointed Minister of Justice in March, was succeeded by his son JSTasrat-ud-Dauleh as Governor of Kirman. This official, at the age of 19, was at once faced with unrest in Persian Baluchistan, and the action of two recalcitrant Chiefs in Rudbar, who had chased the local governor out of it, and practically taken the district. Some persons endeavoured at the beginning of June to bring about an agitation against the Governor, and the Russian Consul is reported to have told him that his British Colleague was responsible for the intrigue. Later the Russian Consul pressed for a public withdrawal from the pulpit of certain remarks made against him by a mulla, and threatened to break off relations with the Governor, who, however, maintained that any attempt to enforce the demands of the Russian Consul would only lead to a riot. In September it was reported that a large number of persons had taken refuge in the mosques, and were telegraphing daily to the Tehran Assembly res pecting their local elections. These disturbances continued during October, and culminated in serious riots, the Imperial Bank of Persia being attacked, hut without receiving loss. The Governor seized the popular leader and deported him. Subsequently he ordered his troops to fire on the mob who had come to demand the return of their leader, and five or six people were killed and several wounded. The crowd took refuge in the British Telegraph Office and the Russian Consulate, and telegraphed to Tehran demanding the removal of the Governor. The matter was taken up by the Tehran National Assembly and the Governor dismissed, hut no one was definitely appointed to succeed him. Sahib Ikhtiar was later appointed Governor : hut appears never to have taken over the duties in person before being transferred to Shiraz as Governor General of Pgrs, when Ala ul-Mulk w as designated in his place. At the end of December His Majesty’s Consul telegraphed that the Nazim and Haji Naib, the dictator of the tow n, had concocted a plot72 lhe British Eesident in Kirman, and were acting in accord with the Itussian Consul They had control of all the offices and were ruling the town hy fear, and spread about reports that British troops had landed, and were going to take Kirman and force Christianity on the people. On the -drd December a midnight meeting was held at which the question of an attack on British subjects ' 5 was discussed. The trouble, however, blew over without any display nf ju-tive hostility. In December 1906 an attempt was made to elect deputies for the National Assembly ; but the member elected by the merchants refused to proceed to Tehran. Early in the year under review the local Assembly at Isfahan arrogated to itself the Government of the province under the presidency of fehaikh Nurullah It met twice a week and interfered in every matter, producing general distrust and confusion. Shaikh Nurullah is brother of one Agha Najafi; and both are amongst the most corrupt of the clergy. Ihrough the instru mentality of these two men attempts were made to bring about the dismissal of the Zill-us*Sultan from the Governorship of the Province, and they were so far successful that, after several disturbances during the early part of March, he was removed from his appointment on the 16th. In the interval Mr. Barnham had to deal with some 3,000 refugees iu His Majesty’s Consulate who dispersed when the excitement subsided. ]Sizam-us-Sultaneh, tbe new Governor, arrived at *bis post in April, and bad manv difficulties to contend with, partly brought about by tbe agents of the Zill-us-Sultan, and partly by the powerful clerical element. He tendered his resignation to the Shah on more than one occasion, and was eventually pro mised the Governorship of Pars. The new Governor, Prince Nayyir-ud-Dauleh, arrived at Isfahan in July. On the 29th one of the servants of His Majesty’s Consul-General was beaten and imprisoned by some people who apparently bore him a grudge. They then delivered him to the Aghas, wdio sent him to the Consulate without a word of apology. The matter was taken up by His Majesty’s Minister ; but so great was the influence of the Aghas that the 'Governor declared he was unable to arrest the persons, who beat the man, in view of their opposition. The town at this period was practicallv fled by the Aghas and was in a state of great disorder ; whilst all the roaas leading to Isfahan became quite unsafe for travellers on account of robbers, wflio held up the post and several Europeans, in addition to many Armenians and others. These robbers w 7 ere stated universally to be followers of Samsam-us-Sultaneh, the Bakhtiari Chief, and the Zill-us- Sultan’s master of the horse was credited w r ith being the organizer of the rob beries. In addition to robberies on the Isfahan-Tehran road, others took place on the Bakhtiari road, and on the Sultanabad road, while the road to Shiraz was also reported to be held by brigands. The discontent against the local Assembly increased in October. Decrees were passed which were never carried out. The Governor finding himself impotent repeatedly sent in his resignation, but it was not accepted ; and so the year closed amidst disorder and lawlessness, whilst bands of brigands still roamed at large and interfered greatly with the trade of the province. In September His Majesty’s Consul-General had applied for an increase of 12 men to his escort, and on the 26th November the Secretary of State ordered their despatch as scon as possible. They sailed on the 5th December for Bushire en route to Isfahan. The anti-foreign movement at Yezd at the end of 1906, was suppressed by action from Tehran, and at the commencement of the year under review the Par- sis no longer complained of persecution But on the 13th Eebruary the head of the Parsi firm of Shahjehan brothers w 7 as shot by some unknown person bet ween 6 and 7 p.m. when returning from the bazar. Strong representations on the subject were made hy His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and a special com missioner with Persian Cossacks was despatched from the capital to enquire into the matter. The reputed murderer had taken refuge in a mosque, and in April Mr. Baggaley, Ilis Majesty’s Consul at Yezd, stated that any attempt to arresthim might lead to a general rising against the Parsi community, and there was no adequate force ayailahle to prevent such a rising. In May it was stated two men had been arrested, hut they were subsequently released after a mock trial, when they took sanctuary. So futile had been the efforts of the local authorities to effect anything, that His Majesty’s Minister was inclined to recommend the expatriation of the Zoroastrian community in Yezd to avoid possibilities of further regrettable incidents. The Mushir-ul-Mamalik who was supposed to be implicated in the murder of the Parsi was later in the year removed from his office of taxation officer, as the result of an agitation by some people who took refuge in the British Vice-Consulate. A counter demonstration in his favor was unsuccessful. This was regarded as being due to the action of His Majesty’s Minister, and British prestige at Yezd greatly increased in consequence. During August several caravans were robbed in the vicinity of Yezd and 65 mounted robbers from Pars were reported to be on the Kirman road, and to have come into conflict with 60 road-guards by whom they were repulsed. During the later months of the year there is little of importance to chronicle. Early in the year a local Assembly, composed of about 30 members drawn s: from the various classes, was formed. Later, a league called the Anjuman-i-Islam, consisting of some 500 of the clerical, mercantile and other classes was formed, the members taking an oath to support the constitutional Assembly with their lives. In March the Quvvam*ul-Mulk returned to Shiraz, and took over the Vazirship of the Province, and becoming de facto Governor appointed his second son commander of the forces. He paid the Government 100,000 tumans for permission to return to Ears, and had the reputation of being in league with the Sbah to suppress or retard the popular movement in that province. It was reported that the Chief of theKashgais, at the Quvvam’s instigation, offered the services of 20,000 horsemen to the Shah for the purpose of suppressing the movement in Tehran. The local Assembly appear to have opposed the provincial authorities, and in March the Quvvam’s son, Salar-us-Sultan, wrote to Mr. Grahame, His Majesty’s Consul, that they could no longer restrain the populace, whose feelings were being worked upon by letters from the women of Tabriz reproaching them for inaction. On the 4th May, in consequence of the growing discontent of the populace, who saw in the Quvvam-ul-Mulk a firm supporter of the autocratic system, the long threatened popular movement broke out; shops were closed and demonstra tions set on foot in Tehran in sympathy. The Quvvam-ul-Mulk’s party took simultaneous action and the whole province at once became disturbed. The high roads were immediately rendered unsafe, and several caravans were robbed, including British merchandise to the value of about £1,800 : whilst the British courier was robbed of his post bags between Bushire and Shiraz. During the whole of the next month disturbances continued. The Quvvam- ul-Mulk refused to leave the town in obedience to the urgent demand of the people, and chaos reigned. Constant robberies of posts and caravans w T ere reported, all of which were attributed to Kashgais. Eventually the Quvvam retired, and Nizam-us-Sultaneh from Isfahan became Governor on the 28th June, when the condition of Shiraz apparently improved, though robberies still continued on the high roads. The clerical party as usual, however, endeavoured to usurp all authority and to get the new Governor removed ; but he appears to have maintained order fairly veil for a time. In October a certain Saiyid Abdul Husain Lari arrived at Shiraz with some 70 followers, with the avowed intention of breaking the power of the Quvvamis, and was welcomed by the hulk of the population. On October 18tb the Imam Jumeh having declined to allow the Lari Saiyid to conduct theprayers at the mosque, proceeded there escorted by armed men to conduct them himself. The Lari Saiyid’s adherents opened fire on the Imam Jumeh’s party, who replied, one man being wounded. Both parties then raced for the telegraph office, the Quvvamis getting in and shutting out the Saiyid’s party. Bor the next five days the disturbances continued with occasionally brisk firing from the Persian Telegraph Office held by 400 Quvvamis, and a mosque occupied by 1,000 of the Saiyid’s party. On October 23rd the bazars were partially closed, all business being practically suspended, and by the end of the month the situation had become worse than ever as the Nizam-us-Sultaneh left Shiraz for good. A German subject was robbed in broad day-light within a mile of the town, and in the opinion of His Majesty’s Consul the local authorities were quite unable to protect Europeans. Urgent representations made to the Central Government were of no avail, and it was recommended that the Shiraz escort which was due for relief should remain until the situation was calmer. To this the Secretary of State agreed. On the 7th November the situation was reported calmer; that overtures for a reconciliation were on foot, and that the sons of the Quvvam were shortly expected. On the 29th November one of tbe servants of His Majesty’s Consul was brutally assaulted and robbed by Kashgais, and another wounded close to the gate of the Consulate. Strong representations were again made at Tehran ; but no steps were taken by the Persian Government to cope with the situation at Shiraz. Robberies still continued and four up posts from Bushire were looted during the 3 last weeks in November—mostly about 12 miles west of Shiraz. It was considered that these robberies were engineered to bring discredit on the local authorities, but no action was taken by them to clear the roads of the brigands. On the 10th December heavy firing, in which several were killed and wounded, took place between tbe town and tbe suburbs. Two bullets, evidently deliberately aimed, struck close to tbe Bank Manager, who was crossing a river out of the line of fire. During the night of the 14th-15th December the Quvvam’s party seized tbe mosque close to the shrine held by their opponents, and subsequently other positions surrounding the shrine. Eiring was steadily, and at times furiously, maintained for several days, and the situation became so threatening that His Majesty’s Consul asked to be allowed to retain the sowars of tbe relieved Tehran escort due on the 20 th until the situation improved. This was sanctioned, but by the latter end of the month tbe situation bad sufficiently calmed down to permit their departure for the coast. En route, however, they appear to have been held up by brigands, and a rifle belonging to one of the sowars and other property was looted. Early in the year the Daria Begi, Governor of Bushire, made preparations to leave that place as he heard that his successor, the Saad-us-Sultaneh, bad already left Tehran for Bushire. His dismissal was apparently due to M. Naus, who attributed to him the hostility shown to the Bushire customs by the native public, and even accused him of smuggling on a large scale. The new Governor arrived at Bushire on the 5th Eehruary and was at once urged by the Customs authorities to suppress the Khans of Bandar Rig and Rudhilleh, through whose ports contraband was believed to pass into the country. He accordingly applied for troops to be sent from Shiraz. The local Assembly had remained quiet during the first two months of the year, but in March inflammatory placards were posted in the town and distribut ed at night. This disturbed the Governor who indefinitely postponed the meetings of the Assembly in April. A local volunteer corps was raised about this time. _ During the next few months lawlessness in Bushire increased and waa attributed to the incapacity of the Governor, who resigned in September.Before leaving he asked the local Assembly to certify that he had oppressed no one ; but his removal caused satisfaction as his tenure of office was marked by unusual unrest in Busbire. The new Governor, Daria Begi, arrived the following month and informed His Majesty’s Resident that all the Gulf Ports had now been included in his Governorship. At the beginning of May about 200 persons took refuge at His Majesty’s Bandar Abbas. Consulate, with the object of obtaining the redress of grievances in connection with the administration of the district ; but left after a few days when the Consul refused to interfere in the matter. In September a large caravan, partly owned by British Indian subjects, was robbed on the Kirman-Bandar Abbas road, and claims to the amount of 1,700 tumans were lodged at the Consulate. In November information was received that a party of Baharlus consisting of 30 horsemen and 70 footmen had entered Bandar Abbas territory through the Ginau Pass and had carried away 600 camels. On the 19th it was reported that the caravan traffic was paralysed owing to the disturbed state of ^ the surrounding country, due to the depredations of the Baharlus, who were said to have risen at the instance of the Quvvam-ul-Mulk. By the end of the month the situation was regarded as so serious, in view of the possibility of the town being attacked by a' large body of Baharlus, who were raiding the neighbour hood, that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf arranged for the despatch of the “ Lapwing ” to protect British interests at Bandar Abbas. The arrival of the gun-boat in some measure restored confidence, and on the 5th December the Governor of the Gulf Ports left for Bandar Abbas with 200 men. Meanwhile the raiders who had been plundering and looting nomads,^ proceeded to Khurgu where thev literally stripped the villages in the vicinity, and then attacked Kalkaji 25‘miles north-east of Bandar Abbas. ? Here they encountered strong resistance and were repulsed after four hours’ fighting. ^ By the 13th the situation had improved, the Daria Begi having taken energetic measures; hut no caravans were yet venturing abroad. Early in the year Captain Lorimer, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, Arabistan. drew attention to the difficulties the D’Arcy Oil Syndicate Co. had to contend with, owing to the attitude of the Bakhtiari Khans. About the same time the latter were in conflict with the Shaikh of Muham- mareh with regard to the Governorship of Behbehan, and were reported to have collected a force at Malamir threatening both the Karun and Behbehan districts. In the subsequent negotiations the Khans appear to have acted with their usual want of good faith, but, in spite of that, apparently got the worst of the bargain. Later, a state of internecine war is reported to have arisen amongst the Bakhtiaris, due to the deposition of the Samsam-us-Sultaneh from the post of Ilkhani in favour of his cousin, the Shahab-us-Sultaneh. This arrangement appears subsequently to have been cancelled ; but in the mean time the Samsam seems to have spent his time out of office in looting the coun try in order to bring discredit on his cousin. At the end of May fighting occurred between the supporters of the two factions, and men of the Sam sam were out in all directions attacking caravans. The growing unrest among the tribesmen, who were becoming actively aggressive, influenced His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, in August, in asking for an increase to his escort, as he considered that unless prompt measures were taken to enforce respect the Oil Syndicate would be compelled to close down their works, for several outrages had been committed on their employes. Early in October H.M.S. “ Comet ” was ordered from Baghdad to Ahwaz, but as she was quite powerless to affect the Bakhtiari question she was again withdrawn. As the situation had not improved by the end of November an addition of 12 infantry and S sowars was ordered by the Secretary of State to be despatched to Captain Lorimer. The party sailing early ^December under charge of a British officer, Lieutenant Wilson, reached their destina tion on the 17 th. In June Sirdar Arfa, Shaikh Khazal of Muhammareh, decided to operate against the Bani Turuf and other tribes about Eawizeh, in order to compel them76 of the interest'of^he 1 Ip^rfan^loans lip 1 tcf the ‘date signatureT'slwulcf ^eithei Kirmansh&amp;h. Anglo-Rnssian Convention. to pay their revenue. The strength of the revolted tribes was estimated from 5,000 to 10,000 fighting men, and the force Shaikh Khazal mobilised was reported to number close on 30,000 tribesmen. Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait arrived with arms and ammunition, etc., from Kuwait on the 16th dune and at once proceeded to join his friend Shaikh Khazal. The rebellious tribesmen were completely defeated in the fight that ensued and lost heavily. The effect of the Sirdar Arfa’s action, it is anticipated, will put a stop to the annual rebellions of the Bani Turuf for some time. During September and October the Sagwands about Dizful disturbed the peace of the district, robberies taking place in rapid succession and creatine general alarm. In the town itself armed parties frequented the bazars in broad day-light and terrorised the shopkeepers by indiscriminate firing. Disturbances ceased on the people being threatened by the Sirdar Arfa wi f h exemplary punish ment. In March it was reported that a good deal of local trouble existed in Kirmanshah in connection with the elections, and that some blood was shed during the riots. The Governor attended the first meeting of the local Assembly on the 16th April; but appears to have taken little interest in it subsequently. Shortlv after, the province was greatly disturbed by the approach of the revolted brother of the Shah (to which reference has already been made) some 2,000 refugees taking shelter at His Majesty s Consulate. These did not disperse until the arrival of the Zahir-ud-Dauleh, Governor of Hamadan, on the 26th June. He was later confirmed in the Governorship of Kirmanshah, and, as he was exceedingly popular with all classes, the town continued quiet as far as the rival parties were concerned ; but robbery and murders were of constant occurrence ^ and seem to have increased during the next few months until eventually m November he too was dismissed. He left his post without orders and reached Tehran m December, there being no Governor at Kirmanshah when the year closed.

The publication of the Convention was followed by a Declaration with regard to the Persian Gulf to the effect that Russia acknowledged England’s special interest in those waters. Advantage was taken of the negotiations to draw up an agreement with regard to the transfer of the Mesbed-Tehran Telegraph line to Russian control, and the transfer of that portion of the Meshed-Sistan line south of Khaf to the control of the British. This document was signed simultaneously with the Convention, but has not been published, as owing to the disturbed condition of Persia a suitable opportunity for obtaining the consent of the Persian Govern ment to the exchange of the lines has not yet arisen. The effect of the Convention on the people and officials of practically the whole of Persia has been to bring discredit on the British, who are generally regarded as having sold Persia to the Russians. Our loss of prestige, parti cularly in the north, has been very considerable in consequence ; and it seems unlikely at present, that we shall readily regain the high position we formerly occupied in the estimation of the Persians, as being their only sincere friend amongst the great Powers. The Persian official view is that the Agreement concerns only the contract ing' Powers: and Persia being absolutely independent considers herself as unaffected by any kind of arrangement between two or more Foreign States respecting her. She will strive to improve her friendly relation with Poreign Powers and scrupulously carry out her obligations as regards loans. A brief description of the alleged Turkish encroachments will he found Turko^sta^ under Turkev-in- Asia. The latest information at the close of 100 ( was to the effect that the Turkish and Persian Commissioners had assembled at TJrumia and commenced their labours. The Turks, however remained m occupation of the districts into which they had encroached, and showed no intention of with- drawing^ su pp 0 sed bythe Persians that the insistent attitude of the Turks is largely due to the secret action of the Germans, who are reputed to be supporting tins Porte until they can obtain further concessions in 1 ersia, when the? will use their influence in effecting a withdrawal from the disputed territory, and so attempt to pose as the real friends of Persia, to the detriment Disputes have again arisen with reference to the vaguely defined bounday Bakch,^ between British and Persian territory in the vicinity of Piran and toaeha, some 30 miles south of Kuh-i-Malik Siah, at various times during the year, ho definite settlement has been arrived at. „ ne , 0 Russian Owin- to the hostility of the Assembly to any foreign loans the Anglo- , A 0 2f a 0 n d Persian Russian loan arrangements fell through, and, before the close of the year, that Finance, nortion set aside by the Indian Government was withdrawn. Efforts weie made by the Persians to establish a National Bank ; but owing to lack of subscri ers, and the general unrest in the country the scheme made no headway at all dui- tog the fear. The financial condition of the country is deplorable and large out- + ° Uno&gt; to the Imperial Bank of Persia still remain unpaid. His Maiestf’s Government agreed to a delay in the payment of the interest due on British loans on the condition of the elimination of the silver clause from the charter granted to the National Bank of Persia. The Russian coupon was *d i full ^ In Tulv the Persian Government made a written request for the consent of the British and Russian Governments to pay the interest alone on the loans, without the sinkin® fund, for 3 years, during which they would cany out their reform scheme. To this His Majesty’s Government agreed on condition that Persia would undertake not to contract any foreign loan without the option Ltog oken to England and Russia first = and that she renewed her engage-78 ment not to grant to the Russian bank, or any other parties, the monopoly of coining silver in the State Mint. At the same time the right to demand pay ment of arrears of the sinking fund at any time within the next 3 years was reserved by His Majesty’s Government, unless some serious effort were'made to put the finances in order in the meantime. By the 1 st October the Persian Government had paid up practically all interest on Government account, amounting to £18,000, since September 1006, except that due on the British loan of which nothing had been paid • whilst the unpaid interest on private debts with Government guarantee amount ing to £ 22,000 also still remained unpaid. On the 10th October it was stated that a M. Bizot had been appointed financial adviser to the Persian Government by the French Government for a period of two years. Great hopes are being entertained by the Assembly for the establishment of a National Bank when he arrives. Persian Customs. British Consulate, etc. Foreign Consulates. The total foreign indebtedness of the Persian Government at the end of the year appears to have been over £4,500,000, of which about £3,476,000 is due to Russia, £200,000 to the French Government, £550,000 to the Imnerial Bank of Persia, and £300,000 Indian Loan. The control of the Persian Customs still remains largely in the hands of the Belgians, despite the dismissal of M. Naus, who w r as succeeded by M. Priera early in the year ■; and the arrangement appears to work satisfactorily in the interests of Persian revenue. Unfortunately, in some instances, their policy appears to be to oppose the interests of British trade, whilst favouring those of Russia, which has on occasion led to a want of cordiality on their part in deal ing with British officials. r In August M. Mornard was definitely appointed Administrator of Customs under the Minister of Finance and many of the Belgian employes, whose con. tracts had expired, were dismissed.

The German Minister Herr Stemrich proceeded to the German Foreign Office in Berlin towards the close of the year and has been succeeded by the late German Consul-General at Calcutta. Germany continues to make every effort to raise her position and increase her influence in Persia, by the establishment of a German Bank and other means. At the end of June it was stated that a draft concession had been submitted to the Council of Ministers, giving free sites for bank premises at Tehran and Tabriz, the recovery of debts with Government assistance, the importation of silver for coinage under existing conditions, and the right to option of the 12 existing mines of those owned by Government. The Council of Ministers passed the German Bank concession and referred it to the Com mittee of the Assembly. The Assembly violently opposed the project, and would only consent to the bank, the capital of which was to be not less than £ 200 , 000 , but to no further concessions whatever. The concession ultimately granted was little more than would be obtained under treaty, and was for a period of 15 years. If the bank is not established within three years the agree ment becomes null and void. Herr Gutmann has recently stated that the moment is not favourable for the establishment of the hank, and no definite steps have yet been taken to commence operations. 'Reference has already been made to the interference of the German Charge, Baron Richthofen, during the troubles between the Shah and the Assembly in December, his action largely neutralising the influence of the Russian and British representatives with the Shah, in their endeavours to ter minate the scenes of disorder. The new German College was formally opened at Tehran on the 5th October. The school had already been working for two or three months and about 100 Persian hoys attend, several of whom can already speak a little German. Two German teachers and a number of Persians are employed, and good results are reported. Military. In the New Ministry, which presented themselves to the Assembly on the 21st March Naib-us-Sultaneh was appointed Minister of War; hut was relieved in August by the Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik. At the close of the year Zafar-us- Sultaneh was occupying this position. On the 20th March the Artillery at Tehran struck on the ground that their salary was long over due, and arrested their chief and the son of the com mander of the Artillery. They were joined by a squadron of Shahsavand horsemen, who declared they had not been paid for 15 years ! It was only after protracted negotiations, and many promises on behalf of the authorities, that the matter was settled. It was reported the same month that some 50,000 rifles and 50 guns had lately been landed at Enzeli for the Persian Government. In April the Minister of War assembled the commanders and heads of regiments with the object of making them take an oath of allegiance; but it is reported the lower grade of officers made a reservation to the effect that they would not take an active part against the Assembly. In May some 65 sowars, 190 footmen and 20 Jambazes collected in the Kainat from Neh, Duroh, Ahwaz, Dastgird and Sunni Khaneh were out in connection with the stopping of arms caravans about Bandan. This represent ed about as many men as the district could raise at short notice, and the only men of any real value were the sowars, who possessed a few breech-loaders. In June a force of 1,000 men was with great difficulty raised in Tehran to undertake military operations against the Salar-ud-Dauleh (see below). In July a detachment of 100 men of the Kaini Regiment left Sistan for duty at Kuh-i-Malik Siah. By the 10th August practically the whole of the Kerai regiment had left Sistan with the exception of about 50 men, who,^ with the artillery squad, formed the garrison pending the arrival of the Kaini regi ment.*7^ i i 80 Tn August a deputation of tlie Assembly was received by the Shah, who pressed on them the immediate reorganisation of the army, and the necessity for foreign instructors. The army was placed under four generals—one of whom was the Minister of Telegraphs— in consequence of the Commander-in* Chief s resignation. On the 11th September the Cossack Brigade was reviewed by the Shah, o-reat precautions being taken for his safety. A force of 270 cavalry, 80 artillery and 270 infantry paraded for his inspection, and performed various evolutions, such as infantry attacking infantry, infantry attacking artillery, and cavalry attacking artillery. ^ Their general efficiency was hut poorly reported on by the Military Attache at Tehran. By the end of October only 400 men of the Kain regiment had reached Sistan. With the exception of 100 men, who were supplied on arrival by the Karo-uzar, the men had no uniform. The artillery were also without uniform, had received no pay ; and their horses, without clothing, were in a bad state. In November military operations against the Turkoman raiders were under taken, hut appear to have largely been a fiasco, owing to the difficulty both as regards collecting troops and getting them to proceed against the raiders (see below). At the end of 1908 the strength of the Cossack Brigade was 1,482 men, of whom 700 were on detachment in various parts of Persia. The actual number for duty in Tehran was about 600. The men of the Brigade, with the exception of 300' Shahsavands and a few Kurds, were all from Tehran and neighbouring villages, and were of very inferior quality as fighting men. The present Shah brought an escort of 450 cavalry from Tabriz, armed with Russian rifles, and trained by Captain Khobaieff of the Cossack Brigade. Composition of When it was decided to undertake military operations against the Salar-ud- force sent against Dauleh, orders were issued for the despatch of a force from Tehran to reinforce saiar ud*Dauieh ^ Q overnor 0 f Hamadan. The troops refused to move until they had received a portion, at least, of the pay due to them. Eventually 1,000 men were collected, their composition being as follows :-r partly of men who had come from Tabriz with the Shah, and partly Shahsavands and mea from villages near Tehran. Cossack Brigade. 1 Battalion of Infantry 500 Irregular Cavalry ... 220 Persian Cossacks ... ... 125 Gunners ... 150 Zamburakcliis (machine gun men) 20 Total ... 1,015 T urkoman F orce. with 6 mountain guns on mules, and 2 machine guns. This force finally left Tehran on the 8 th June and reached Kum about 8 days later. The whole affair is instructive as showing the state of the Persian army. Out of a nominal garrison of between 7,000 and 8,000 men it was only with the greatest difficulty, and after much delay, that 1,000 could be collected and sent off. The whole force would have been quite useless had it been called upon to fight, and, in fact, it would probably have refused to do so. Field During the Turkoman raid troubles it was stated that 700 sowars had been despatched from Tehran : whilst the Meshed authorities gave out that the following force would march at once to attack the raiders :— 400 Regulars from Meshed with Artillery, 400 Regulars from Turbat-i-Haidari, and 1,000 Tribal Cavalry.After 10 days* delay tlie following force assembled 60 Persian Cossacks. 200 Infantry of the battalion quartered at Meshed. 22 Gunners, and 2 Brass mountain guns. Their equipment, supply of ammunition and so on were almost farcical and they appear never to have got further than the suburbs of the town. At the end of the year the National Assembly had under consideration the N biy°!Sd Anuy! m ’ status of the Russian Commandant of the Persian Cossack Brigade. It is contended that he should be under the orders of the Minister of War and this arrangement has been adopted. The Brigade is therefore no longer under the direct orders of the Shah, as formerly. A scheme is shortly to be submitted for the reform of the Army, and another for a Volunteer force. By Articles of the Constitutional Law of Persia, the supreme command of the Military and Naval Porces is vested in the Sovereign, with whom also rests the right to declare War and to conclude Peace. The Army Vote must pass the National Assembly every year, and no foreign troops will be allowed to serve the Government. Captain C. B. Stokes of the Indian Army took over the duties of British Military Attach^, Military Attache at Tehran from Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas in July. Tehran. His Majesty’s Government have sanctioned the retention of the appointment E tachf at Meshed.* of a Military Attachd at Meshed for a further period of 6 months from the 20th October 1907, pending consideration of the proposal for the permanent retention of the appointment. A supplement to Colonel Picot’s brochure on the Persian Army was prepared The Persian Army, bv Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas shortly before he gave up his appointment as Military Attache at Tehran, which brings the strength and composition of that force up to date. Owing to the disturbed state of Persia during the year under review, and Co “ n s ^ 1 e a s r cor f s uard3 particularly owing to the dangerous situation which arose in Isfahan and in the e Bakhtiari country, it was decided to increase the escorts with His Majesty’s Consuls at these two last places. In December 12 additional sowars were sent up to Isfahan vid Bushire, and 8 sowars and 1 2 Infantry to the Oil Syndicate fields in the direction of Ahwaz. Otherwise the strength of the various Consulate guards remains as in 1906, and the usual reliefs were carried out as in normal years. The possibility, however, of a necessary increase to the guards throughout the country, has been considered, and a course of action has been decided upon in the event of a rising on a large scale against foreigners in Persia. Durino 1 1907 there has been a considerable increase in the strength of the R “| 3 i Qu ard f &lt; onsu ' Russian Consular Guards throughout Persia, and consignments of arms and ammunition, especially in Khorasan, were received by them during the year. The Military Attache at Tehran writing in May pointed out that since March 1905 the number of Russian troops employed as Consular Guards in Persia had risen from 62 to 173. This number was still further added to before the close of the year, and it is probable there are well over 200 now employed on this service. In addition there are about 100 regular troops with the Prontier Commissioner at Gumbad-i-Kabus; whilst the Russian Agents at Kushan and Daragaz have usually a few Cossacks with them, as also have the engineers on the Julfa-Tabriz road. Communications. —Postal Service, Early in the year the question of surcharged stamps arose, the Persian use of Sur- postal authorities directing that letters bearing Indian stamps with the sur- mP ’ charge “ O. H. M. S.” should be treated as unstamped, and double rates82 Post Office, Bnshire, Parcel Post arr ngements. Closing of Kain Post Offices. Parcel Post Con vention. le tried. The matter was referred by the Minister at Tehran to the Foreign Office, and the English postal authorities stated that the Persian Post Office was within its right in raising the objection. In future, therefore, it was decided, ordinary stamps should be used for official correspondence. The Belgian management of the Persian Post Office at Bushire ceased from the 22nd March, the Persian official year. A circular issued by the Director of Customs and Posts ordered that all foreign parcels, except those addressed to Tehran, Meshed, Kashan and Tabriz, should be opened at the point where they cross the Persian frontier. As this ruling would practically have killed the parcel post trade between India and Sistan, representations were made to arrange, if possible, that Sistan and Birjand also might be included among the places where parcels might be cleared. It was finally decided that parcels intended for Sistan and Birjand should be opened at Sistan and Custom dues paid there. In July it was under consideration to close the post offices at Neh and Sarbisha, as they did not pay expenses. As the closing of the latter place would have detracted from its conyenience as a summer head-quarters for His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan, the execution of the order was postponed with reference to Sarbisha. Towards the close of the year the question of the Parcel Post Convention with Persia, and that of British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf, was under discussion. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was authorised to accede to the Persian Government’s request that Persians at the southern ports should no longer be compelled to use Indian stamps, on the understanding that Persians could not be forbidden to post their letters at British Indian post offices, in which case Indian stamps must be affixed. It was thought very desirable in return for these concessions that objectionable sowars at Sistan and Birjand should not be employed. His Majesty’s Charge was further empowered to pro- ceed with the negotiations for concluding the parcel post arrangement, and to try and effect a settlement as to the question of the position of the Bandar Abbas telegraph office and cable house. In December it was reported that the contract for the post between Sistan and Birjand had been given to Pasand Khan, a notorious Eussian Agent, whose employment on the Sistan—Kuh-i-Malik Siah postal line had been ineffectually opposed by us in 1906, and whose men interfered with a British party ot sowars m September, to which reference has already been made. Representations have been made, and it is hoped that steps will be taken to cancel the contract, as it is clearly opposed to the spirit of the recent Convention with Russia. -S.— Telegraphs, Meshed-Sistan ^ ^ P, r 0 P 0Sal dou Me the Tehran and Sistan lines, His Teiegraphiineand Ma J est y s Goveinment desired to avoid expense on both, particularly on the Rabat extension, latter, the need for which was not clear; and enquired if a scheme could not he formulated by which exclusive use and control ot the existing line could be secured, as a matter of right, to Consular Officers of each Power respectively, on the line worked by the other Power, for a sufficient number of hours daily/ On the 26th January the Government of India replied that the cost of the second wire on the Meshed-Sistan line was justifiable, not only politically as FS7, e T al C00tr °, 1 T 1 ; theline with the Russians; but also commercially, • e /! 1R S ere ‘ U P W1 ^ P nd ian and Eussian svstems, large expansion of traffic must follow.

He also sanctioned, shortly after, an additional telegraph signaller for Meshed proposed by the Government of India. With reference to the Robat extension, Major Kennion in March tele graphed that he had heard from the Mumtahin that it had been sanctioned, and would shortly be put in band by the Persian Government. On the 29th April Sir 0. Spring-Rice reported that the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment had been privately applied to by the Minister of Telegraphs for assistance in providing material for the extension. In May the Secretary of State asked if the Government of India would be prepared to allow the material at Robat to be taken over at rate list price, exclusive of cost of carriage and other charges. The Government of India stated the rate list of the material was Rs. 36,250 and cost of carriage Rs. 1,04,233, and that they saw no reason why the material should be given at less than cost price if the line was not to be con structed by the Indian Government, and if they are to have no special rights over it. They suggested one solution would be to let the Indo-European Department take over the material at cost price plus carriage, and add this to the cost of the Central Persian line on the terms of that line; but ii His Majesty's Government desired to sell the material, less cost of carriage to Persia, the Government of India would agree, but trusted His Majesty’s Government would bear half the loss. An attempt might then be made to secure a pledge from the Persian Government that none, but Persian or British employes should be allowed on the line, and that it would never be made over to any one but the British. In July it was rumoured that a Russian loan had been made to the Minister of Telegraphs for the construction of the line from Robat to Sistan, and for the duplication of the line between Meshed and Shahrud. Confirma tion of the loan was later received, but Sir C. Spring-Rice had a verbal assur ance from the Atabeg that he would not allow the extension to pass into Russian hands, and acknowledged this assurance in writing. It was eventually decided that the status quo regarding telegraphs should be observed between the British and Russian pending the proposed exchange of lines, and nothing further was done towards carrying out the extension during the year under review. In April Sir G. Spring-Rice pointed out the desirability of renewing the telegraph conventions with Persia, which expire in 1925. On the 15th May Sir E. Grey directed Sir A. Nicholson to inform the Russian Minister for Eoreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government proposed to take action to renew the telegraph convention with Persia. A favourable opportunity had not, however, arisen before the close of the year to open this question. The mismanagement of this line by the Persian authorities has been notorious for some years, and various suggestions were made in 1905 to improve matters; but were dropped owing to the anticipated opposition of the Shah and the Grand Yazir. The question was revived in March of this year, when the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz pointed out in regard to improvements to this line, that connection with Europe would be cheaper via Persian than Turkish offices, and that private cypher messages are not accepted by Turkish lines. He further stated the Persian lines are all practically useless. Major Cox in forwarding the above representation of Captain Lorimer remarked that he leared the Ahwaz-Borazjun line would never work satisfactorily unless taken over by the I. E. Telegraph Department. The tract through which this line runs being one of much importance to Indian interests, the Government of India addressed the Secretary of State in May pointing out the inconvenience suffered, and suggesting that the taking over of the Ahwaz-Borazjun line should be included in any negotiations opened with the Persian Government on the subject of the renewal of the telegraph convention.

Meshed Sistan Line. Sir 0. Spring-Rice in writing to the Foreign Office stated it was hardly to he hoped that the existing line would ever be in permanent working order, and their remained the alternative of a cable to Eaofor which the consent of the Turkish Government would have to be obtained. The line could be constructed for 30 miles in Persian territory to a point opposite Fao, from which a cable could be laid to connect with the English Office. On the 2 nd August the Secretary of State replied that His Majesty's Government did not consider the moment opportune for raising the question of bringing this telegraph line under the control of the I. E. Telegraph Department although they fully recognised the advantages of such an arrange ment. In reply to a further communication from the Government of India on the conclusion of the negotiations with Russia, the Secretary of State telegra phed, on the 25th September, that the Foreign Office were of opinion it would be useless to suggest the transfer in the present temper of the National Assembly; but that the question would continue to receive the attention of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. The question of the Bandar Abbas cable house and Telegraph Office has not yet been settled. (See Annual Summary for 1906.) The matter is being taken up in connection with the Parcel Post Convention, and post offices in the Persian Gulf. The Bam-Robat line across the desert was completed during the early part of the year, and the road which follows this route is likely to be very generally used for all traffic from Bandar Abbas and South-East Persia into Sistan. On the 5 th October telegraphic communication between Karachi and Tehran, by the Central Persian Telegraph line, was established and worked well. The line runs over land from Karachi through Panjgur to Nukundi, a point on the Quetta-Robat line. Thence the line runs via Bampur, Kirman, Yazd, and Isfahan to the capital. In June Sir A. Nicholson reported that M. Isvolsky had proposed as a corollary to the Anglo-Russian Convention that the British Government should hand over the control of the Tehran-Meshed line, and that they should receive control of the Meshed-Sistan line, from a point to be decided on in the neutral zone. His Majesty’s Government at first insisted on the transfer of the whole of the Meshed-Sistan line to British control, but subsequently withdrew from their attitude, and in J uly agreed to accept the Russian proposals, subject to the condition that the Russian Government would adopt a friendly attitude as to the continuance of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s concessions which expire in 1925. Urgent representations on part of the Government of India were of no avail, and at one time fears were entertained that the Russians were financing the Persian telegraph authorities, in order to construct and obtain control of the proposed Robat extension. The document ultimately signed on the 31st August by Sir A. Nicholson and M. Isvolsky agreed that the Tehran- Meshed line should pass into the control of Russia under the same conditions as when under British control. The Meshed-Sistan line was to be divided into two sections at Khaf—north of which it would be under Russian control, and south under British, on the same conditions as now under Russian control. Two commutators are to be placed at Khaf, one for the Russian wire, and one for the British; and in order to avoid delay in transmission the two are to be linked up. All rights, obligations, expenses of up-keep, etc., are to devolve on the respective Powers in whose control the lines are. Before the exchange could be carried out it was necessary first to obtain the consent of the Persian Government, and the Assem bly being very sensitive about the Convention no favourable opportunity arose during the remainder of the year to effect the exchange. The Russian staff on the Khaf-Sistan section shortly before the end of October consisted of 6 mechanics and telegraphists : but three of these shortly after appear to have returned to Russia on reduction in establishment. There were three employes on the line north of Khaf.At various times duiing the year complaints were received from Meshed and Sistan resaiding the obstructive attitude of the Russian signallers during working tiouns, for which the British signallers were supposed to have the line° C. — Hoads. The Karguzar of Sistan intended to construct this road during the year chiefly by forced labor. The total cost of the work was estimated at tumans Siah-su5nhad. 5,900 : but apparently little or nothing was done as, at the end of the year, Bis Majesty’s Consul pointed out to him the necessity for improving this road. In March, at a meeting of the Meshed Town Council, it was unanimously Meshed Dushath resolved that immediate steps should be taken to place this road ina road ' condition fit for wheeled traffic from the Russian railway station to Meshed : and further that it should he constructed with a view to forming a suitable railway alignment at a later date. This road was considerably damaged by the heavy rains in Northern Persia Meshe &lt;i Ashkabad during May, at least one bridge and part of the road having been washed away. road ' It is stated that laden fourgons were carried away by the force of the water when trying to ford unbridged streams. It has again been reported that this road has been sold to the Russians, and enquiries are being instituted in the matter. The Sirdar Mukarram sent a caravan of 40 mules from Ahwaz to Dizful ne S via Kialan through Luristan in July, under the care of the Dirakwand Chief. Dizful. Its safe conduct through the district favourably impressed the traders, and there is a probability of the road being opened for traffic. The Julfa-Tabriz road was completed and in working order early in the juifa-Tabriz year. Russian trade should benefit greatly by its construction, now that the road ’ railway lias reached Julfa. It has been found that a cart drawn by two oxen can bring six camel loads from Julfa to Tabriz for less than one camel, and almost as quickly. There was considerable difficulty experienced by the Russian road administration early in the year in collecting its tolls, a profound objection being manifested by the villagers to the additional tax imposed upon them. It is reported that a Persian Transport Company with a capital of 50,000 Persian Trans, tumans has been formed at Meshed to compete with the Russian Transport P ort Com P an y- Company. It is said to have been organized by Takiov, the Baku Millionaire. In September it was stated that Mubammad Hasain, Kazirani, head of isfahan-Bushire the Musudia and Islama Company, had obtained a concession for a chaussee road - . from Isfahan to Bushire, work ou which had been started 2 months before. It was understood that 6 miles had already been cut, and that the road is being constructed for the Amin-uz-Zarb and his partners. The opening of this Russian road during the year is regarded as likely to Kazvin-Hamadao deal a considerable blow to British trade in Central and Western Persia. It road - is suggested that the only means of saving the situation is to open up the Dizful- Khurramabad route, which is the best and shortest way from the sea to those regions. The disturbed state of the country, however, has militated auainst anything definite being done in the matter. The Lynch road is still a subject of dispute between the Bakhtiari Khans Lynch road, and the Persian Transport Company, as the former continue to repudiate certain claims as regards the expenses incurred in its con struct ion and^ up - keep. Parts of the road are in a very bad state of disrepair : but the^ bridges were thoroughly over-hauled and repainted by one ol Lynch s employes m t le autumn. Reference has already been made to the insecurity of the main trade i nsecur it y 0 f routes, between Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan and Tehran, and those in. the Bakhtiari raderou s. country, owing to the lawlessness of the tribes and the inability of the Central Government to maintain order during the year under review, lire condition of these roads naturally greatly affected the trade of the country, tia c a times beins practically at a complete stand still on these arteries of commerce.Ka r un River. £6 D .— 'Rivera.

Two steam launches arrived at Bandar Abbas on the 2nd January for the Customs Administration. Another sfeam launch arrived at Bush ire on the 16th, but as the Persian customs authorities were unable to pay for it, it remained in charge of the Residency. As an instance of the prevailing commercial activity of Germany in the Persian Gulf it may be mentioned that the Deutsche-Orient Bank, Hamburg, early in the year addressed several prominent local merchants at Bandar Abbas and elsewhere, offering its services in furthering their commercial transactions with Northern Europe. The Hamburg-Amcrican line has continued a fairly regular service through out the year, visiting all the chief parts in the Gulf. It is stated that they are prepared to sustain a loss of 3 ,&lt; 00,000 marks over a period of 3 years on their shipping to the Gulf in competing for the trade, aed they propose putting on lighter draught vessels in order better to negotiate the bar of the Shatt-al-Arab. In marked contrast to their determined bid to capture the trade of the Gulf is the irregularity of the steamer calls made by the British vessels of the Anglo-Algerian Steam Ship Company, the Bucknall Steam Ship Lines, and the West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company. It is understood these three companies arranged that there should be two sailings of the Strick and Bucknall lines combined, for every one of the West Hartlepool Company. The result lias been that at times a* many as 3 steamers of the contracting companies have been lying off Bushire within a few days of one another, while at other junctures there have been intervals of from six weeks to two months between arrivals. The Hamburg-American Company were unfortunate enough to wreck one of their steamers, the “ Teutonia, ” in the vicinity of Maseirah Island during the last monsoon : but the crew all succeeded in reaching Masqat in safety in their boats and travelling overland, and appear to have been well treated by the tribes. British India The British India Steam Navigation Company have maintained their Comjmny avisati ° n re S u ^ ar services between Karachi and the Gulf ports throughout the year. The Russian Steam Navigation Company trading between Odessa and the Gulf also visited the Gulf ports on occasions during the year with 2 well appointed vessels, the “ Euphrates ” and “ Trouvor” German and British lines. Commercial. There was a considerable increase in both imports and exports during the year March 1906 to March 1907 (as compared with the same period in 1905-06) in the trade of Persia. The total imports amounted to £8,620,795-105. being an increase of £891, 633-125. on the preceding year; whilst the exports amounted to £7,067, 636 165 . being an increase of £ 1 , 201 , 670 - 45 . The value of the total external trade had increased by £ 2 , 093 , 203-165 or about 13‘3 per cent. This increase seems more remarkable than the increase of 13 per cent. in 1905-06, inasmuch as in that year trade was enjoying a natural recoveryfrom the commercial depression occasioned in 1904 05, by the Russo Japanese War. The approximate detail of values is given in the following table :— Countiy. Russia ••• Great Britain ... Turkey Fiance Austria ••• Afghanistan ... Germany ... China ••• United States ...

Writing in June His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran stated :-; 1 The Commer cial outlook”in Persia in by no means encouraging. The political conditions are so uncertain that trade must be carried on with a margin of risk entirely disproportionate to the possible profits • At the P re9ent ■ 1 ’ m , c ” owiU P to political disturbances, the tightness of the money markets, and the want'of safety on the high roads, trade is carried on under the most unfavour able 1 circumstances. The Customs Department, which was so severely attacked bv the National Assembly, and seemed at one time likely to revert entire y lr i ^ Persian hands with tli inevitable chaotic result, is, however^ still under Belgian administration, and complaints have not increased of- late. The principal British firms actually trading in Persia are Messrs. Lynch Brothers. Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co. H. Stevens (Tabriz). Messrs. Grey Paul &amp; Go. (Busbire)* Messrs. Lynch’s operations are principally oarried out in the and Messrs. Ziegler are chiefly occupied m the carpet trade at Suita •&gt;. Mr. Stevens trades in the North, and Messrs. Grey Paul &amp; Co. devote their business to the forwarding agency in the South. At that time it was stated that on the whole exports were brisk and imports dormant. Towards the close of the year there was a marked reviva! in the trade, by the Nushki route, with Sistan and Eastern Persia generally, d October its total ^alue was nearly Ks. 88,600, or a net ^crease of Rs 33 2o8 over the figures of October 1906. The exports to Persia rose tiom a Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 18 , 318 , while the imports into BaiucU stan-Ra^S^ wc e trebled. It is hoped that this is a likely indication of brisk tiade both ai during the whole of the winter season. With regard to the Karun Irrigation scheme advo ^ ^ y t . t ' ie D ?^ i t !'i Minister at Tehran, Sir E. Grey decided early in the year that as the politicosituation was so unsettled, and the moment inopportune for encouraging foreign concessions, the scheme could not at present be entertained. On representations being made in February by Sir C. Spring-Rice that there seemed to be some reason to fear German action, and that the international scheme might be the best way of preventing it, His Majesty’s Government approved the international scheme, and instructed His Majesty’s Minister to make a joint oral communication with his Russian Colleague to the Persian Government to the effect that they had no objection to it. On the ?nd March the Secretary of State was informed that the Govern ment of India would have preferred to support the Shaikh of Muhammareh in obtaining the concession ; and later it was ascertained the Shaikh would not admit foreign participation, except an expert adviser, and v 7 ould undertake the irrigation works himself. He wished to manage it himself, if inevitable under British guidance and with British co-eperation, and would oppose the acquisition of a concession by any Foreign Powder or Persian Syndicate. He particularly asked that he might be kept informed by us as regards the development of the scheme, but no further development appears to have taken place during the remainder of the year. Throughout the year under review large consignments of arms have been landed almost weekly on the Makran Coast from Masqat. All efforts on part of the gun-boats in the Persian Gulf to put a stop to this illicit trade have proved futile, and the gun runners have enjoyed almost equal immunity from capture on land. In April, however, it was reported that an Afghan caravan of 400 Gulf rifles, proceeding in the direction of Mashkel, was captured in the neighbourhood of Dizak by Shahzadeh Mirza Mahmud. In May a second arms caravan was ambushed at Kacha Gorge when 24 camels were killed, 29 captured, and practically the whole escort ^killed, after fighting well and holding out for 4 hours. 17 camels were laden with’ arms and ammunition. For several weeks parties were out attempting to capture an elusive third caravan, which apparently got through successfully into Afghan territory eventually. The above is the only success that can be recorded, and during the latter half of the year constant reports were received of consignments being landed and removed from the coast, seemingly with little or no°difficulty. It was impossible for the gun-boats, under then existing arrangements, to get accurate or timely information as to where landings were to be made and hence no captures were effected at sea. The Persian authorities themselves appear to derive considerable profit from this illicit trade, and therefore cannot be depended on to co-operate with the navy. The trade has increased enormouslv m consequence along the coasts adjacent to Masqat : while Bushire itself has not been exempt from the attention of the gub-runners, due to the laxity and indifference of the Customs officials.

Climate and Health. There was some difficulty in December 1906 with the Russian S. S. th? uaia Persian “ Trouvor ” as regards the boarding of quarantine officers at the Gulf ports, Gulf, on the grounds that Russian vessels were not in quarantine. The matter after reference to Tehran was, however, satisfactorily settled, and during her return journey down the Gulf in January the ship submitted to medical inspection. A farther contretemps with Russian officials at Bandar Abbas occurred in March when Air. Belayew of the Russian Consulate boarded the Russian S.S. “ Euphrates ” before she had received pratique from the quarantine officials. Next day it was reported that a servant of the Russian Consul struck the quarantine guard and boarded the English mail ship “ Madura which was in quarantine. The Russian Consul refused to allow the man to undergo quarantine. On the 10 th March the Persian Government consented to a reduction of the quarantine period from 10 to 5 days from date of leaving the last infected port. In April Sir C. Spring'Rice telegraphed to the Foreign Office that there was a probabilitv of our control of quarantine arrangements in Southern Persia being attacked, and asked that steps might be taken to secure the maintenance of existing arrangements. In May several cases of imported plague were located near Bushire, and the services of an additional medical officer were asked for ; and the Government of India in view of the anticipated attack on our arrangements approved the proposal of the Resident. The latest available information is to the effect that the Austrian delegate on the Sanitary Council, Tehran, is sending a proposal to his Government for the establishment of an International Sanitary Council at Bushire with a British officer as President.

Serious alleged Turkish encroachments on the Persian Erontier have con tinued throughout the year, and the situation has now reached a somewhat acute stage. Turkish and Persian Commissioners were appointed towards the close of 1906 under the presidency of Mustafa Pasha, the Yali of Mosul, to discuss matters in connection with the frontier about Pasveh, and also to delimit the whole frontier between the two countries. Nothing appeared to result from the meet ing of the Commissioners, and, in June of the year under review, the Minister at lehran reported that the Turks were active on the frontier both north and south at Sirdasht and Bagsai. The Biitish and Russian Ambassadors at Constantinople were instructed to make earnest representations to the Ottoman Government, and to impress upon them that the status quo of 1869 should not be disturbed. Sir Nicholas O’Conor was informed by the Grand Yazir that the first aggression bad been committed by Persian tribesmen in the neighbourhood of Pusht-i-Kuh, but that order had been icstoied, and all the troops withdrawn from Persian territory. At the beginning of August, however, the Persian Grand Yazir informed £ xt f P r ^ n .^‘^ ce Shirks had occupied Margaver on the eastern limit of the frontier zone, and a few days later he reported that 6,000 Turks with gims were within 2 miles of Urumia, and that many Christian villagers had been killed. The American Charge d’Affaires had received similar informa tion from the American Missionary Society near that town. It appeared that Turkish troops bad attacked a Persian Camp, established for punitive purposes to the west of the village of Tuli, one mile within the frontier zone The Per- sian Government feeling alarm at these incursions, and being unable to put a stop to them, appealed to Great Britain and Russia for assistance. „ The encroachments of the Turks continued, and on the 15tb August Sir \-VrT W f lns , t , ra , cted t0 lDf ° r m the Porte that their orders for withdrawal, which had professedly been issued, had been disregarded by the military autho- nties, and to urge the immediate despatch of further orders. By this time the Turks were in occupation of the Baradust district up to Kutur and were levying customs, and were reported to have mobilized troops in the Van vilayat for T=^ the ^ ,aQ , f ^ ier - 1,1 the °P inion o£ the Eussian C° n 3Pl at Lrumia the situation had become grave, the Turks having seized the oppor- uu S m ea , k . n , eSS t0 SaWle the lous staudi nS frontier question in their nlh Y ‘ 1 ]le ■ iurkl 1 s, : i commander at Ban had informed him in writing that Re nad no orders to withdraw. b T i T S ial1 haf ? ex pressed his willingness to accept a joint Commission on the p on tho condition of the withdrawal of the Turkish troops from the places ey already occupied ; and wished the simultaneous appointment of British Bp B ff USS1 ? n C0mm !

Here he met Tahir Pasha, confirmed the presence of Turkish troops in districts to the east of the frontier zone, and stated the Turks showed no disposition to withdraw from the positions they had occupied. Early in October Sir N. O’Conor made a fresh representation to the Sultan in the form of a communication, pointing out that the fact encroachments had been made was incontestable, and urging him to give orders to his Commis sioners to desist from acting on the claims and pretensions of the late Dervish Pasha, in order to avoid a most unpleasant and awkward international situation. This seemingly made a deep impression on His Majesty; but no measures ware taken for withdrawing the troops, and great delay was occasioned by the fact that the Persian Commissioner, Muhtasham-us-Sultaneh, refused to leave Tehran to meet the Turkish Commission on the frontier, pending arrangements as to certain powers he demanded, until the 4th November. Meanwhile the Turks were pushing up additional troops towards the frontier to be prepared for eventualities, and an order for mobilizing on a large scale was given in December, when the serious character of the disturbances in Tehran made a profound impression on the Sultan and the Porte. Up to tho end of the year no settlement was arrived at regarding the frontier, the Turks continuing to occupy the positions they had previously taken up, whilst 34 battalions were reported available ready for service on the frontier if required. The Commission was said to have begun its labors near Urumia. Throughout the year the condition of the Van, Bitlis and Mush districts van, Bitiis has been one of general disorder ; and large numbers of Armenians fled elsewhere Di arbekir. to escape the cruel treatment they experienced at the hands of the Kurds and tax-gatherers. It is estimated that at least 120,000 Armenians applied for permission to emigrate into Russian territory. Eventually the state of affairs became so intolerable and the dishonesty and incompetence of the Yali so great that in June a serious rising took place in Bitlis, in the course of which the Yali’s house was attacked and completely plundered by the mob, whilst he was compelled to take shelter in the military barracks. A Council of Kurd Shaikhs then sent a telegram to the Porte demanding the removal of the Yali, and when threatened by the employment of military force, replied they had 15,QUO Kurds under arms—whereupon the Palace gave orders that the Vali should be removed from his post. In July Tahir Pasha arrived at Bitlis, and was appointed Yali. He at once admitted the pitiable condition of the Christians in the vilaycit, and the abuses and corruption which had existed under the late regime, and agreed that proposals set before him by the Russian and British Consuls were just and necessary for the welfare of the vilayat. Unfortunately before he had been able to accomplish much he was ordered to the Persian frontier in connection with the enquiry to be made as regards the alleged Turkish encroachment. The Daftardar who succeeded him had not sufficient influence to ^ keep order or to introduce any reform : but matters improved more satisfactorily on the appointment of an acting Yali, Eeizi Beg, Mutassarif of Sairt, at the end of September. The general condition of the Mush population was at the same time one of complete misery and subjection, with no hope of alleviation from their oppression. Their land was unlawfully seized by Begs and Aghas, and they were bound either to become the bond slaves of their oppressors or to leave their homes. The country between Van and Bitlis was in a state of almost complete anarchy, and many Armenians are said to have been massacred by Kurds, and many soldiers to have been killed and wounded. The harsh and impolitic action of the Yali of Yan resulted in bringing about an understanding, during July, between the Armenian revolutionaries and the young Turk party, the numerical strength of the former being more than sufficient to overcome the troops.In August the appointment of Rashid Pasha as Vali of Van 'would, it was hoped, result in better Government of this vilayat; but the absence of Tahir Pasha on the Persian frontier was regarded as likely to have a deplorable effect on the chaotic condition of the Bitlis vilayat. A serious crisis was reported from Diarbekir towards the end of November, the neighbouring country having been overrun by Ibrahim Pasha. The Moslem notables had practically deposed the Vali, and demanded of the Sultan, by telegraph, that measures should be taken to reform the administration and suppress the Pasha. A Commission was sent from Aleppo to redress the grievances and tranquillity was restored. At the latter end of November the Ottoman Government decided to take forcible measures to repress the rebellious behaviour of the Kurdish tribes in the eastern provinces of Anatolia, and concentrated troops at Chemigusek in the south-west of the Dersirn district. In the fighting that ensued, although the Kurds lost heavily and several of their chiefs were captured, the soldiers were unable to follow up their success, as the Kurds took refuge in the mountains which had been rendered inaccessible owing to a heavy fall of snow. The troops consisted of 4 battalians, two from Kozat (Kharput) and two from Erzindjan, advancing from different points in order to more effectually surround the Kurds. ngandage in One Chakirji, a notorious brigand, is credited with having committed many vnayat of Aidin. depredations in close proximity to the Smyrna-Aidin Railway during the year. The military authorities appear to have made little heading in the suppression of brigandage in this vilayat, due largely to the generally friendly attitude of the rural population to the brigands, and their dread of Chakirji on account of his ferocity and fearlessness. German tions in Sea. aspira- ^ appears that Germany is again directing her attention to acquiring one the Red of the Earsan group of islands in the Red Sea, presumably as a coaling station. According to reports received in September, a German ship recently called there, and landed several men who ingratiated themselves with the inhabitants. It is said the latter, attracted by German gold and courteous conduct, had given the Germans a paper signifying their willingness to live under German protection if the Sultan cedes the island to that Power. Disturbances at On the 11th Eebruary the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia reported Najaf. that fighting had broken out between the Zugurd and Shumurd Arabs. The Vice-Consul at Kerbala had telegraphed to the Kaimmakam of Najaf to warn British subjects to leave the town if he considered it unsafe for them to remain there, and to protect them on the road. Sagwand Raid. In June a gang of Sagwands from Persian territory, numbering some 500 strong, made a successful foray against the Bani Lam Arabs in Turkish territory. The Arabs, taken unawares, failed to ward off the attack, and their camps were plundered, the booty, comprising a large number of cattle and 40 rifles, being carried off. Disturbances at In January the \ ice-Consul at Kerbala reported that the El Grait and Hindiyeh. Tatla tribes on the TIindiyeh were fighting amongst themselves, and about 65 from both sides were said to have been killed. The Mutassarif sent a detachment of Zaptiehs to Hindiyeh to put a stop to the fighting. Disturbances on The Tigris was closed to traffic by sailing vessels between Amarah and Euphrates^ and Q urna k ear ly iu May on account of raids committed by Hatim, son of Seyhud, of the A1 Bu Muhammad tribe; but was shortly after re-opened. On the 7th July His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah reported to Sir E. Grey that there had been further disturbances on the Tigris. Grain traffic had been seriously hampered, and sailing vessels had been attacked, and one burned. The British firm of Fenwick had two of their grain lighters looted and one of the crew killed. Sir E. Grey thereupon telegraphed to Sir N. O’Conor to renew his representations to the Porte for the protection of the river traffic. Sir N. O Conor replied that the Porte would do all they could for the pro tection of navigation; but that the tribes 'were turbulent and the task was93 Hi, sl11 Si 'S»V trat ioiaii '*S II, Najaf (o 1 them to lome 5(11 }raitaiii milaW f sent a itah ^ Seyhoi a difficult one with the forces at their command. He sta f ed he was pressing for the regular patrol of the river by a Turkish gun-boat. On the 8 th July the Political Besident in Turkish Arabia reported that a fight had occurred between Kut-ul-Amarah and Sawaira, in which from 70 to 90 Arabs bad been killed, and that further fighting was expected. On one side were the A1 Bu Sultan and El Guyaish Arabs of the Zubeid tribe, and on the other Zubeid Arabs under Shaikh Bashid Ibn Sumarud. On the 5th September the Meyah Arabs, a section of the Bahaivab tribe, oinked the Muntafik Arabs in the Hai Caza—about 3 hours distant from Hai— the losses on both sides being reported as 500 killed. On the 6 th September a battle was reported at El Jivar, about 2| hours hv steamer below Amarah, between the forces of Gadban (Bani Lam) and Sevhad (A1 Bu Muhammad), the losses on both sides amounting to five or six hundred killed and many wounded. Great fears were entertained for the safety of navigation on the river, as the viluyat authorities had done nothing to prevent hostilities. About the same time disturbances w r ere rife also on the Euphrates, where the El Bidaur tribes attacked the Arabs of Ajmi-bin-Sadan Pasha at Katey, 3 hours west of Kasirya on the Euphrates, on the 25th August ; whilst on the 28th August the El Khafoya fought the El Ahuda tribes at Sheula, about 2 a hours from Shafna on the Euphrates. The former lost 3a killed, and the latter 80 killed besides numerous wounded on both sides. Prior to this, ■fighting had taken Place between the Shaikhs of Madina and Neherat on the 27th Ju y, when the opposing forces numbered 12,000 and 10,000 armed men respectively. Manv we™nded and 73 killed, and the Shaikh of Neherat retreated Al though there was a Turkish battalion at Quruah the fighting was undistuibed hv the Turkish authorities. On the 8 th August another skirmish took place in which 200 men were killed and 22 wounded. Finally some Saiyid interfered and caused the Shaikhs to conclude an armistice, which has since been observed. On the 22nd July the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia reported that Sir Nicholas O’Conor had informed him that a strong Commission was to .-isit the mlavats of Mosul, Baghdad and Basrah with a view to repoiting ■ measure's required to settle the tribes, and to develop the country by iriiga ion Zd other means. Pertev Pasha, the Chief of the Staff, whose sympathies aie believed to he with Germany, was to he one of the members of the Commission. Medjid Beg, the Valiof Baghdad, was relieved by his successor Hazim Beg, in February. In March Mr. Maxwell of the '&lt; Daily Mail ’’arrived at Baghdad with the intention of visiting Kerbala and Najaf and follow ing the proposed line of the Baghdad Railway.

Vali of Baghdad. Personal. Acts of Piracy.The men who murdered Mr. Glanville at Marghil last year were captured, and sentence passed on them by a court-martial at the end of April. It was ur^ed by the British representative that the execution should take place publicly in Basrah. The proceedings of the courl-martial were, however, subsequently denounced ; but at a later date it was stated that the Porte had abandoned its objection, and that the Ministry of War had promised to confirm the sentences passed by the court- nartial. The prisoners seem later to have escaped during- a jail outbreak at Basrah, and the year closed without any punishment haviuo- been inflicted on them. J r ^ Mr David Fraser, correspondent of the c Times, * was robbed and wounded on the border of the Mosul Vilayat on the 25th December by Kurds. He was removed to Urfa, and troops sent in pursuit of his assailants. Military. On the 22nd December 1906, the Political Resident at Aden reported that negotiations between the Turks and the Imam appeared to be still proceeding, but that no final settlement had been arrived at. From subsequent reports received by the Resident, up to the 26th January 1907, it appeared that a resumption of hostilities might be imminent, but his information was unreli able. A month later a native correspondent stated that minor hostilities had broken out, and that Sana was again threatened by the Imam’s forces. It was seated, at a later date, that the Imam was manufacturing Le Gras ammunition at a place near Ibb, called Uzlat-ad-Dais, and that he also possessed an ammuni tion and powder factory at Kalat Adat. The Turks at this time were reported to be collecting hostages from various tribes with a view to further action against the Imam. During April there were continued rumours of fighting in the Yemen near Sana, and the Imam was said to he contemplating an expedition in the direction of Taiz and Kataba. His forces were reported to have looted the Da mar treasury, in the vicinity of which there had been heavy fighting. On the 27th April the Vice-Consul at Hodeidah reported that the Imperial Commission appointed at Constantinople to enquire into the grievances of the Yemen Arabs, and to arrange a truce with the Imam had arrived. The Com mission had been given very wide powers to treat with the Imam, but the Vice- Consul considered that the latter s claim to the Caliphate, and his repeated demands for autonomy, and the evacuation of Sana and its neighbourhood by Turkish troops and officials, would preclude the chances of an agreement. On the 26th May Major Jacob at D’thala heard that the Turks were in straitened circumstances at both Ibb and Yarim. It was thought the general disaffection of the Arabs was due to Turkish revenue exactions, which were said still to continue in spite of orde-s to the contrary from the Forte. On the 8 th June The Times of India announced that advices from Yemen reported that the Arabs had severely defeated six battalions of Turkish troops near Sana. r It is said that Faizi Pasha, Governor of Yemen, sent a despairing telegram to the Porte on the 5th June, stating that the troops were hard pressed by the Arabs, that ammunition and money were indispensable, and that it was difficult for the troops to hold out until relief arrived. The treops defeated at Sana fled into the town, where they mutinied and seized the telegraph office, whence they telegraphed their grievances to the Sultan. Asa serious crisis was apprehended the Vice-Consul at Hodeidah suggested that it would be greatly in the interests of Turkey if the existing state of things was made known to the Sultnn ; and fc-ir N. O Conor therefore proposed to inform His Majesty, who had previously asked him Ins advice privately in regard to the Yemen. At the end of June fighting was reported at Ka Jahran, Damar and else where, and hostilities were also said to have taken place not far from Kataba, and in the Rada canton. .News of the capture of Rada was received shortlyafter, whilst Yarim and Damnr were besieged, and fighting had become near Nadara, 12 hours from Kataba. general Reports were also received by the Government of India to the effect tint great activity throughout Yemen among scattered bands of the insurgents being shewn. The Hifash Mountain position, north-east of Hodeideh was occupied by rebels, and it was rumoured that Taweela had fallen as well as tlm districts of Otma and Osab-el-Ali. ^&gt;eu as me The Government of India communicated these reports to the Secretary of State for India, and pointed out that if the Imam secured autonomy of Upner Yemen his boundaries would march with those of the British Government and the question as to the nature and channel of communications with him would require early consideration. In the middle of July it was reported that the Imam’s, forces were active in the country lying between Sana and Taiz, on one hand, and about Kataba on the other. The rebel forces were only one day’s march distant from Kataba, and an attack being regarded as imminent some of the inhabitants are said to* have sent their valuables to D’thala, Jihaf, etc., in British territory, whilst the Government Treasury was removed to Ibb. The Turkish forces at that town were reported to have moved out of the town and taken up a position outside, and on the 20 th July were said to be invested. Turkish re-inforcements about the same time left Taiz for Nadara and Shair, the latter place, up above Kafcaba, having been occupied by the Imam’s forces when the Turks retired to a place known as Rasalawd, distant only 5 hours from Kataba itself. Rada had rendered full submission to the Imam, and his forces were said to have left that district and to be concentrating on Yarim and Damar. He was stated to be busy collecting stores and provisions to prosecute the campaign. Reports received by the Resident at Aden towards the end of July were to the effect that the Imam’s forces were commandeering supplies 4 hours from Ibb, the Kaimmakam of which place was said to have secured hostages from, the neighbouring Shaikhs for their good behaviour and resistance to the rebels; the Turkish forces had suffered considerably in the recent fighting about Yarim and Nadara, and communications were said to be blocked between Damar and Sana. Considerable disorder prevailed at Hodeidah amongst the Turkish troops there waiting for transports to convey them back to Constanti nople. The Sultan, however, appeared determined to bring the campaign to a successful conclusion, and three transports with re-inforcements were reported to have reached Hodeidah. At Amran the Imam’s forces were said to have met with a repulse. Up to the middle of August it appears that desultory fighting continued in South-Eastern YYmen ; but the Imam’s forces were not making much headway. The Imam’s main objective seems to have been the Rada district from which he hoped in due course to make a successful move upon Kataba and Taiz. Re-inforcements of 1,381 men were landed at Hodeidah on the -? 0 th July, the same ship returning with 800 time-expired soldiers ou the 9th August, 1,780 having previously left on the 2nd August. On the 8 th August 1,500 more recruits were landed at Hodeidah for the Yemen Army Corps, as well as the members of a Commission from Constanti nople to investigate Yemen affairs: a deputation of Arab Shaikhs and Ulamas representing the Arab tribesmen, who had two months previously proceeded to Constantinople, also returned in the same ship. These men had accompanied the Commission, which had arrived in Yemen in April, back to Turkey, where they had been most hospitably entertained by the Sultan from whom they had received decorations. They had presented certain conditions on behalf of the Imam, which had been considered in Council; but no definite decision had been arrived at although it is understood that the Ministers had been generally in favour of concessions being made to the native demands, as they were fully conscious of the uselessness of wasting more men and money in a futile attempt to subjugate these insurgent tribes. About the middle of August eight battalions of Albanian troops, some 2,100 strong, who had been stationed at Sana, where they had committed excesses in the earlier part of the month, impatient of being relieved and sent hack to their Army Corps in Turkey, marched off without permission for thecoast, carrying away 2 cannons and their arms. They also brought alon? wit.h them as a hostage General Mohidin Pasha, son-in-law of Paizi Pasha, the military commander, to ensure they would not he molested in their march. They reached Hodeidah on the 2ist August where they remained quiet until they were shipped home early in September. These were all that were left of 7.200 Albanian troops who had been in theYemen since 1905, as they had been utilised in all the Turkish engagements against the Imam, and suffered particularly heavily in the winter expedition of 1905 against the stronghold at Shahara. Affairs in the Yemen quieted down towards the end of August and it was anticipated that there would be comparative peace for at least 3 months The Imam’s lieutenants withdrew to Shahara and Kaflat Adat, and the Tucks were said to have re-occupied the various positions they had recently seized. On the 31st August 1,800 recruits from Akabah were landed at Hodeidah, and on the 23rd September fresh drafts, 1,400 strong, also reached that port, followed on the 27th by a further re-inforcement of 2,400 men. These troops were moved up in the direction of Sana to fill up the different battalions. During September and October a qniet state of affairs existed ; hnt it was thought the Imam was arming and provisioning quietly in his stronghold pre paratory to a winter campaign, as he fully realized the weak position of the Turks in the Yemen. It is doubtful if the total strength of the Army Corps stationed in Yemen proper (excluding the Sanjak of Assyr) excluded 13,000 men of all arms in September; but considerable reinforcements were expected and it was hoped a capable commander would he sent out in place of Faizi Pasha, who is very old and in his dotage. On the 18th September a deputation of Arab Shaikhs and Ulamas landed at Hodeidah from the Hedjaz. The mission had been deputed by the Grand Sherif of Mecca at the express wish of the Sultan, to tour through the dis tricts of the Yemen, administering advice to the inhabitants to remain loyal to the Caliph and to renounce their allegiance to the Imam. The Vice-Consul stated that the deputation consisted of old and infirm members, and that it was not in the least expected they would attempt to visit places outside the pale of Ottoman influence, nor that they would approach the Imam’s adherents with a view to opening up negotiations with him. The deputation proceeded to Sana where they remained a fortnight without effecting anything and returned to the coast expressing dissatisfaction and disappointment at the result of their mission. They returned to Mecca at the end of October. In November it was reported that there had been an engagement between some of the Imam’s followers and the Turkish forces at Amran, which resulted in fairly heavy casualties on both sides. Further hostilities were regarded as imminent as the Imam had heard the Turks were making elaborate plans for his capture. Communications. A, Railways, During the year under review no progress has been made in the construe- tion of this line, and matters stand pretty well as they were at the end of 1906, in this respect, the line terminating in some fields about Bulgurlu, at the foot of the Taurus range. On the 21 st November 1906, Sir F. Bertie wrote to Sir E. Grey that M. Fiction had informed him, from enquiries made, that it seemed the railway could not be completed to the Persian Gulf without the aid of the Paris and London markets; and it was doubtful if they could even carry it through the Taurus range unaided, as they depended on being able to obtam further kilo- metric guarantees. The German Ambassador at Constantinople, in December, also expressed the opinion that it would not be possible for Germany to build the whole line without the help of England. He appears also to have told a French financier that the Emperor of Germany desired the co-operation of France in the further construction of the line. It was thought, therefore, that the Germans could not for the next 3 years make any further important progress in construction without outside financial assistance.97 eft ofii OCfn nfiLi '5 I ! d tkt Amj C 8 i r udk 12 | eirt irentsiith sultoii entleiiffl iclMiW regardeii i ulofll the foot d hera2 fS l Paris ail preDtl On tlie 4tli January 1907, Sir C.

In March it was reported, on what was considered trustworthy authority, that the French and German financial groups had come to an agreement con cerning the continuation of the railway, according to which the Germans were to construct the Taurus line from Ereglito Adana (220 Idiom.) and the French the next portion to Aleppo (200-300 kilom.). It was stated this would give the French at Aleppo a junction for their railway lines in Syria. Mr. Oppen- heimer stated that it was generally believed that Great Britain was endeavouring to prevent tbe construction of the Taurus line : but British capital for this was not required, as the capital for this line was already secured. It was thought no negotiations with Great Britain would be resumed until after the Taurus line had been constructed. On the 25th April Sir E. Grey told M. Gambon that the most essential condition for British co-operation was that they should have the construction and working of the Southern, or Baghdad end of the line to the Gulf, and that if such coufd be satisfactorily arranged, the British Government would be willing to participate. In June Sir A. Nicholson informed Sir E. Grey that M. Isvolski had men tioned to him that he had received from Count Benckendorff a copy of a memo randum setting forth the views of His Majesty’s Government in^ respect to the Baghdad Railway. M. Isvolski had remarked that he doubted if the memoran dum would be pleasing to Berlin, and that it seemed to him at first sight that Great Britain had taken up an attitude somewhat in advance of that which she had hitherto assumed. It was pointed out to Mr. Isvolski that His Majesty s Government had merely communicated their views to the Irenchand Russian Governments for their confidential information, and there was no intention ot communicating it for the present to the German Government. In July Sir E. Grey told M. Gambon that be had heard there were diffi culties both at St. Petersburg and Paris about the British Governments proposals in regard to the Baghdad Railway ; but he desired it to be understood that the British Government did not wish to press anything a.t the mom ^t, hut that if the Baghdad Railway began to move again they desired the matter should be discussed with them. On tbe 17th September Sir N. O’Conor reported to Sir E. Grey that the Anatolia. Anatolian Railway Company had received a concession for the ° ^ large tract of country south of Konia. The district affected ( ’ was between Konia and Karaman, the water being brought “ e Schehir Lake, and was traversed by the Konia-Eregh section of tneBaghda Railway, the receipts of which should be largely increased by this scheme. 1 work was to cost 20,000,000 francs on which the Turkish Government had guaranteed 5 per cent, interest secured on the tithes of the reclaimed la d. On the 23rd December 1907, a contract was signed by which the Anatolian Railway Company is authorized to double its share capital, &amp; P res ®“ ^ to £2,700,000 nominal. Of the existing share capital only 60 per cent. paid up. This important increase is to be utilised m doubling canital Pasha to Pendik, a distance of about 50 kilometres ; m provic 1 &amp; c+rensth- required for the Konia irrigation works; and thirdly, m improving con , ening the Anatolian line to permit the running of an expr monev nection with the Baghdad Railway. It is also anticipa will be spent on the renewal of a part of its rolling-stoc . , ^ Q Hediaz Great progress in the construction of this rmlway was ma e wa!r ' year, the line in parts being laid at the rate of 3 to i i 3 whilst the actual record was kilometres in one day. , v • So rapidly was the line pushed on that ^^.^^f^heen constructed versary of the Sultans accession day, some 290 kilome • • f ronl during the previous twelve months. The Imperial 0 ^ ( j ur i n o&gt; the Constantinople for the inauguration of that section con ^ ^ outlx year, were therefore able to travel by train to El Ola, some o Rail- Bail-of Medain Salih, where the inauguration ceremonies w 7 ere held on the 1 f September. 8 At that time the earthworks on 40 kilometres beyond El Ola were beino* completed, w hile 44 more kilometres were prepared for work as regards plans and profiles. Eh’om the other end, at Medina, 4 kilometres w 7 ere already finished and 46 kilometres were being laid out. The number of the troops working from the Damascus side to El Ola and beyond was about 5,000, while 3 battalions were working at the other end from Medina, all being in good health and receiving their pay regularly. Some 20,000 men in addition were employed on the construction of the line. The stations between Tebuk and El Ola (the section constructed between 1 st September 1906 to 1st September 1907) had not been built, except one at Hamis, where a block-house had been constructed ; and in a few other places the foundations had been laid, and cisterns for w r ater constructed. The stations being built, or proposed for this section areas follows : Tebuk (692nd kilom.), Wadi Athel (72Cth Idiom.), Darul Haj (744th kilom), Mudabka (755th kilom.), Hamis (782nd kilom.), Dezad (805th kilom.), Moaddem ( 8 ^ 8 th kilom.), Hishra*Sana (853rd kilom.), Dar-el Hamra (880th kilom.), El-Mutaab (904th kilom ), Abu 'laker (918th kilom.), El Mushim (930th kilom.), Medain Salih (953rd kilom.), and El Ola (about 980th kilom.). So far as the informatiou available goes it may be regarded that rail-head had reached a point from 620 to 650 miles south of Damascus by the close of the year, and it was anticipated that Medina would be linked up by May 1908. It is stated, however, that the Sultan has ordered the completion of the Medina- Mecca section before next pilgrimage, and also the construction of a line from Mecca to Arafat. From the testimony of the “ Times ” correspondent the line is excellently laid, and on the few r sections where engineering difficulties were met with they have been successfully overcome. But the traffic arrangements are bad, the trains are unpunctual, the rolling-stock defective, and the locomotives are not carefully tended, as there is no trained class of drivers and stokers. The building of the line has not been unattended with danger, as workmen straying have been killed by the Bedouins, and it has been found necessary to construct block houses at selected points for the defence of the line. As the railway nears Mecca the danger of attack is expected to increase. The Haj at present brings much money to the tribes owning camels, and their principal source of income will lae gone when the locomotive enters the sacred City; but the Turks anticipate little difficulty in overcoming all opposition. It is stated that the cost of construction on the sections south of Maam when easy country is entered upon, is not more than £2,500 per mile, this figure including the purchase of construction rolling-stock. According to the estimate of Meisner Pasha, the Chief Engineer of the Railway, some £3,000,000 had been spent on the construction of the line up to the middle of 1907. r B. Roads. ' # the 1 st September a carriage service between Baghdad and Aleppo was inaugurated, the first carriage from Aleppo performing the journey in 8 | days, while the carriage proceeding in the opposite direction occupied a day longer, Iwo carriages were to start every other day, each carriage taking four persons, and the charge for each seat £ T. 4 in the first carriage and £ T. 2 J in the second. From all accounts the road is very rough indeed, and it has been suggested it would be better to drive slower and increase the length of the journey to 10 days. It is understood that motor cars are shortly to be introduced on this road, and that arrangements are being made with contractors at Constantinople for their supply. . ^he Political Resident in Turkish Arabia reported in March that the desert postal route from Hit to Damascus, which had been closed in August 1906, had again been opened.C. Inland itialer Transport. oa ucjo ^ w. —navigable all the year round for light draught steamers to Mosul it would be necessary to blast away between 40 and 50 outcrops of rock, and to build numerous dams to divert the water in the nroad readies, during the low season, into one channel. The undertaking would take 8 years to complete at a cost of about 100,000 Turkish Liras to the Government, besides a large annual expenditure to keep the channel open. The venture would probably not prove commercially pro fitable, so he proposed removal of the 3 outcrops of rock below Samarra, which would enable steamers drawing 2 ft. 4 inches to reach that place all the year round, and Mosul for 4 or 5 months in the high season Owing to the high river in April the Saniya steamers tried to run up to Samarra. One steamer had to stop some hours short of that place owing to the strength of the current against which she could make no headway. Another steamer the “ Itesafa ” stranded on a rock, and had to remain where it was, as the river fell 4 or 5 ft. within a few days. It may be several years before the river rises high enough to refloat her, if she does not break up in the mean time. On the 28th January Sir Nichols O’Conor, in the course of an audience Lynch , s third with the Sultan, referred to the loss caused to British trade by the refusal to steamer on allow the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to run a third Ti e ris * steamer on the Tigris. It was pointed out that there was such a congestion of traffic that 40,000 packages were delayed at Basrah, and that all further con signments from Europe had been stopped by the Company as they were unable 10 ° deal with the goods already collected. The Saltan gave no definite answer, hut on the 11th March Major Eamsay, at Baghdad, reported that sanction had been obtained to run a third steamer, subject to the condition that she snouid fly the Turkish flag while under steam. Later it was reported that Lynch’s third steamer was alioued to unload at Baghdad without objection. It towed a barge. In August 1906, the desirability o£ having a survey of the Tigris under-Survey of taken, as it was not possible to follow the course of the river on any ot the Baghdad, existing maps, was pointed out to the Government of India by the 1 olitical Resident in Turkish Arabia. He suggested the employment ot tbe Royal Indian Marine Steamer “ Comet ” for this purpose, under the direction of Lieutenant Hamilton, the Commander, during the months of March, April and Mav, when the river was high The Government of India approved the under taking provided the observations were taken with due care and secrecy; and in February the Political Resident reported that the survey had been started. In April the survey was completed by Lieutenant Gardner, who had taken over command of the “ Comet ” from Lieutenant Hamil on. On the 80th March the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia forwarded to Hindiyeh Barrage. Sir N. O’Conor a copy of a memorandum giving an outline of certain proposals formulated by M. Cugnin, a French Engineer in the employ of the Ottoman Government, for constructing a dam across the Hmdiyeh Canal. It was estimat ed that the barrage, including a lock, would cost about £ T. 140,000 and that it would take 3 years to complete the work. Major Ramsay thought it probable that the work ^ould he carried out before long, and was anxious that the contract should e o am ^ British firm, as he considered it not unlikely the German oveinmen o inclined to give assistance to some German firm, which won ic a 111 * back for ns. Tenders were invited at the end of the yeai ic c am o structed with 23 compartments, 9'80 metres wide : these compartments to be made of “ ciment arme ” and between each there is to be a buttress to suppoit a working bridge of 3 metres. The dam is to have a bridge me 0 and 8 metres in width. . . The country all round Baghdad was subjected to a great iDundahon in Fi^ds^^^n, April, when the Tigris topped its banks and flooded immense areas, conve Baghdad into an island, the desert into a lake, and causing a vast amount ot damage. In May it was reported that all business m Kerba a was still owing to the whole population being engaged on earthworks to save t e100 town from the floods. Equally unusual floods appear to have come down the Euphrates at the same time. Sagiawia Canal. j n September the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia reported that a considerable breach had been caused in the old Sagiawia canal connecting the Euphrates, some miles above Ealuja, with the ligris near Baghdad ; and that an attempt was being made to close it, as it used to cause annual inundations of the country near Baghdad, and had become a source of considerable danger. It was generally thought that if the breach was not successfully closed before next high season there is serious danger of a material portion of the Euphrates deserting its present bed, and joining the Tigris near Baghdad. In this connection there is reason to believe that were this canal treated in a scientific manner, it might be possible to irrigate large areas between the Tigris and Euphrates ; and also enable the upper waters of the Euphrates to be navigated by passing steamers up it from the Tigris, which would be likely to prove a profitable commercial undertaking. Commercial. Early in the year Mr. G. A. Lloyd, Honorary Attache to the British Embassy at Constantinople, was appointed to conduct a commercial mission in Asiatic Turkey on behalf of the Commercial Intelligence Committee of the Board of Trade. Mr. J. C. Gaskin was officially appointed as Assistant for Trade and Com merce to the Politicial Resident in Turkish Arabia with effect from the 9th June 1906. At various times during the year rumours were prevalent that a German Bank was to be established at Baghdad at once : but the year closed without this having been done. In June the Consul-General at Baghdad addressed a letter to the Board of Trade urging that a British bank should be established there. A certain Dr. Hugo Grothe, a German, arrived in Baghdad from Mosul in April, after having travelled over considerable portions of Turkey-in- Asia. He gave himself out as being a geographer and etlmographist; but there is no doubt he was engaged in making commercial enquiries, as later be wrote several letters to the German press, pointinp’ out the great possibilities of Mesopotamia and parts of Persia—through which he subsequently travelled—* as profitable fields for German commercial enterprise, and political activity. ARABIA. Aden and Hinterland. * Political. The evacuation On the 8 th January 1907, the Secretary of State stated that it was the of thaIa -intention of His Majesty's Government that the Political Officer at B’thala should be withdrawn as soon as local conditions would permit, and that frontier affairs should then he dealt with by occasional visits to D’thala when necessary. The Political Officer received various instructions regarding his dealings with the Turkish authorities, with the Amir and his subjects, and other sections of the tribes, and was called upon to furnish a report, as soon as practicable, as to the date when the withdrawal would be possible, and as to means of con ducting frontier affairs after withdrawal. On the 10th January, Major Jacob reported that general fighting was proceeding on the D’thala plateau between the Amir's forces and his refractory Shairi and Jihaf tribesmen, and that the Amir had not got the best of it in these contests. Later in the month there was a recrudescence of fighting, and the situation was still far from satisfactory ; and up to the middle of Eebruary intermittent fighting was still going on at D’thala. In the middle of March Major Jacob reported that the Arair of D’thala had made formal advances to his Shairi tribesmen with a view to the settle-mpnt of all existing diffeiences and a week later officially condrmed. tlie news of the rapprochement, which it was hoped would also include a reconciliation with the Jihafi. From that time fighting practically ceased, and on the 6 th April the Resident reported the settlement of all differences. On the 27th January, the Resident at Aden suggested that the Political Agent at D’thala might he withdrawn on the 2Sth February, The Government of India replied on the 6 th February that as it did not appear that the Political Agent was in any immediate danger, and as the whole question of the manage ment of the frontier and tribes required very careful consideration, they pre ferred that he should remain for the present at D’thala until a scheme was worked out. On the 25th April the Government of India replied to Mr. Morley’s de spatch of the 8 th January pointing out the great advantage of the presence of a Political Officer at D’thala in settling inter-tribal quarrels, checking Turkish intrigues, and adjusting disputes between them and our tribesmen, and in preventing the tribes on the British side of the frontier from being drawn into the struggle between the Turks and Arabs in the Yemen. As regards the effect of an early withdrawal, the Secretary of State was reminded that the Imam of Yemen had been making overtures to the Abdali Sultan, as he was anxious to enter into a treaty of alliance with the British Government. So long as a British Agent was at D’thala his personal influence would frustrate the efforts of the Imam to attract protected Chiefs to his side, which might otherwise result in serious complications with the Porte. If, in spite of these considerations, the Secretary of State was determined on the withdrawal the Government of India proposed certain arrangements for ensuring the safety of the Aden-D’thala road, by entering into agreements with the Kotaibi, Haushabi and Alawi tribes. Certain stipends and grants of arms and ammunition were proposed to the Chief of these tribes in return for which they would be held responsible for the safety of those portions of the road traversing their territory. The Government of India represented to the Secretary of State that'there was every reason why these measures should he brought into force before the withdrawal, as otherwise the withdrawal might be the signal for outrages on the road, and disturbances among the tribes, which would make the situation a very difficult one for the Resident to deal with from Aden. These proposals were approved by the Secretary of State on the 14th June • on the understanding that the Resident was satisfied that the scheme for paying the Kotaibi tribe through the Amir of D’thala would not occasion fresh disputes and that the redistribution of the posts was so arranged as to be acceptable to the tribes concerned. These arrangements w 7 ere to be introduced before the Political Officer finally left D’thala, provided that he did not prolong his stay there for more than one month after receipt of orders to withdraw. No deputation of a Political Officer to the frontier after the withdrawal was to take place without previous reference to the Secretary of State, except in case of great urgency. These instructions were communicated to the Government of Bombay and the Resident at Aden. Draft agreements were drawn up, and the arrange ments included the immediate destruction of the Dar-al-Quabtain, the demoli tion of Saleik fort on withdrawal to Nobat Dakim, and the handing over of Nobat Dakim to the Abdali Sultan upon the final withdrawal to Aden. In a telegram ot the 23rd July the Resident proposed the evacuation of D’thala should take place at his discretion within one month or signing t e proposed agreements. On the 25th July the Secretary of State enquired what steps had been taken to give effect to the instructions contained in his telegram of the It June, and was informed by the Government of India on the 29t l lXi ? the Resident’s proposals involved the retention of the Political Officer a ia a beyond the 29th July, which was the date on which he should leave m accoiance with the orders of His Majesty’s Government. The draft agreements were being considered, and in their opinion it would be undesirable to evacuate D’thala, and demolish the posts before the agreements had been approved. On the 1 st August the Secretary of State telegraphed expressing regret that further delay had occurred, and on the 28th again stated that he was surprised and disappointed at the delay, the reason for which he could not understand. He requested that any matters not strictly necessary for purposes of with drawal might be excluded from the scope of the agreement; but if necessary the agreements must be considered at leisure and the Agent was at once to withdraw. On the 3rd September he telegraphed instructions regarding certain alterations and amendments to be made in the draft agreements, of which he bad received copies. These were forwarded to Major Jacob who was instructed by the Resident to ascertain informally the willingness of the Chiefs to execute them, and, if acceptable, to conclude them. At the same time the Resident deprecated any appearance of undue precipitation, for transport had to he collected, and there were no quarters in Aden for an extra 300 men as the great heat rendered it inadvisable to accommodate them in tents. He therefore proposed withdraw ing the Political Agent to Nohat about the end of September, and to withdraw his escort to Aden for embarkation to India by the 11th October. To these proposals Mr. Morley agreed. On the dth October the Resident telegraphed that the Aden Hinterland had been evacuated, and that the Chiefs concerned had been summoned to Aden to sign the proposed agreement on the 15th. Subsequently Major Jacob reported the circumstances under which the evacuation had been accomplished. On his way down from D’thala the fort at Saleik and the Hardaba block house were dismantled by the 81st Pioneers, while the Kotaibi Shaikh was persuaded to pull down Dar Taiz, and men of the 81st Pioneers and some of the Aden Troopers were sent up to ensure the completion of the work. Major Jacob then ascended the hill on which Dar-al-Quabtain stood, with the object of demolishing that fort. The Alawi Shaikh unexpectedly refused to permit the demolition of the fort until the sum of Rs. 500, promised him as a gift, was paid first into his hands. He was reminded that the receipt of this sum was contingent on his demolishing the Dar, and building another elsewhere; but at this juncture the Shaikh’s following of from 50 to 60 armed men began to show signs of hostility, one man even going so far as to aim his loaded carbine at Major Jacob. Happily the by-standers seized him and prevented his firing. The Kotaibi on the opposite hill seeing night coming on and Dar-al-Quabtain standing feared that Major Jacob had gone back on his word, and sent a message across that, until he completed the demolition, the British sepoys would remain in their hands as hostages. As it was now pitch dark, and as Major Jacob could not leave the country without destroying the Dar, he paid Rs. 500 to the Shaikh, blew up the Dar, and, proceeding to the Kotaibi Camp, released the Pioneers. In spite of repeated summonses none of the three Shaikhs with whom the agreements were to have been concluded in the middle of October, had up to the end of the year put in their appearance at Aden to sign—nor does the Resi dent consider there is any immediate likelihood of their doing so. The result of the withdrawal has been the recrudescence of petty hostilities between various tribes, acts of looting, and the transfer of their allegiance by some of the tribesmen to the Turks, to whose intervention our evacuation of D’thala and the Hinterland is commonly ascribed. JBarhemis .—Owing to the behaviour of the Barhemis in pillaging an Relations with Italian-owned dhow that went ashore between Khor Umeira and Imran towards Disturbances^ 1 ^ the end of 1906, the Government of India agreed to the stoppage of the pay-103 mP nt o! the stipend of Rs. 600 per annum to the Shaikh of that tribe, pending the payment by him of a sum of Rs. 2,200 as compensation for the property looted. This has not yet been paid by him, and the general behaviour of the tribe has remained unsatisfactory throughout the year under review, the above sum was paid by the Government of India to the Italian authorities. On the 9th February the Resident at Aden reported that the camel of a costal runner had been shot on the 3rd idem near Al Matlah on his v ay from A. Moilnh to Nohat Dakim. The man stuck to his post hags, and being subjected ^^i^fiirther attaclc carried them in himself to Nohat. The offenders were unkn^Sh tfe supposed to be either a section of the Kotaibi or discontented soldiers of the Abdali. ^ On the ■'7th February the Resident at Aden reported that the Awrabi Shaikh^ehl er broth er Mob sin bin Abdulla had killed and stabbed one of his Sbal . Riv Ahmad on the 12th. The same evening he shot a brother of id the^following afternoon shot himself. His actions were ascribed to intemperate habits.

Great Britain recognised that a like right belonged to the French and Italian authorities within their respective territorial waters. At the end of December 1903 the Resident at Aden reported news of the landing of a large consignment of arms and ammunition from Jibuti on the neighbouring coast. The information was sent on to the Abdali Sultan with the request that he would intercept it if possible. On the 9th March 1907 the Resident at Aden intimated that the Mamaji Shaikh, a petty Subehi chief, had claimed to be able to prove that all the leading tribes of the Protectorate were taking an active part in the illicit arms traffic with Jibuti. The Resident sent an Arab spy to that place and stated that from bis report it was clear that the arms traffic to Arabia was considerable and unchecked. On the 4th May the Resident reported that the Attifi and Barhemi were stated to be making a good thing out of the illicit arms traffic, as they received 1 dollar per rifle and 10 per cent, of the ammunition landed from Jibuti. On the 28th July the Resident at Aden reported that the Zaranik tribes were actively importing arms from Jibuti either at a place called Al Jah, or when interruption by one of the Hodeideh gun boats was feared, at Mutaina near Mokha. The arms traffic was said to be particularly brisk at Ramadah, where a rifle could be purchased for 8 dollars, and 16 cartridges for 1 dollar. In October this tribe w ere again reported to be busily engaged importin'? ammunition from Jibuti at Taheita. At the end of August the Assistant Resident at Perirn reported that con siderable traffic in arms between Jibuti and the opposite coast existed, and that the dhows concerned generally passed the straits of Bab*el-Mandeb a few hours before dawn. The Attifi Shaikh, Saad ba Ali apparently reaped such profits from this illicit trade by the dues he levied on imports at Ras-al-Arah that it was con sidered be would probably require a larger allowance than 40 dollars a month to make it worth his while to attempt to stop the traffic. The Abdali supplies were generally landed at Khor TJmeira, hut when either place was considered risky consignments were landed at Imran or Ali Mujahar. On the 6 th September the Secretary of State requested the Government of India to take steps to ensure that a more rigorous and constant vigilance shouldbe observed at Sbehr, Mukalla, and other places on tbe Arabian Coast in tbe neighbourhood of Aden, in respect to the arms traffic, and to report to him instructions that were issued. On the 21st September the Resident at Aden reported that he bad sent a secret agent to Mukalla to ascertain tbe extent of tbe traffic there ; and on the 5th October stated that it appeared that the Governor there exercised a fairly effective control over the arms traffic, and allow r ed no secret importations of arms. Ihe Fadthli Sultan had also been requested to check the traffic on his coast, and to confiscate and send in any arms that might be discovered passing through his ports. This he promised to do. On the 5th October it was reported that quantities of ammunition were being landed at Ras-al-Arah, and a week later the Resident at Aden had re ceived a report from Perim that 100 cases of French ammunition had been landed at the same place for tbe Juledi Shaikh. Tbe dhow concerned was said to have flown the Prench flag and to have been manned by a Dhankali crew. At the end of October it was reported another dhow full of arms had passed fiom Jibuti to Ras-al-Arah; and at tbe beginning of November tbe Resi- en at Aden stated that the traffic continued briskly on the west coast, and anothei consignment had been landed in Barhemi limits during the week. On the 2lst December tbe Resident reported that the Wahidi Chief of Bir All near Aden had sent in 24 Le Gras rifles and 9 cases of ammunition, which had been landed near Al Mujahar by some persons then unknown. This fact was regarded as quite a new departure.Fersonal. His Excellency the Governor of Bombay made a tour of impection to Aden and the Hinterland during April. He visited Shugra, Shaikh Othman, A1 Hauta, the capital of the Abdali country, and inspected the various civil and educa tional institutions at Aden. Major General E. De Brath Commanding the Aden Brigade was granted leave by the Government of India from the 17th April to the 28th July. During his absence Lieutenant Colonel P. It. Legh was appointed to officiate as Political Resident. General De Brath resumed his duties on the 5th August. Bahrain. his sur* abrogation of the agree- On the 30th April Major Cox telegraphed that plague had broken out in Plague, the Bahrain islands, and that between the 21st and 27th April there had been seven cases and four deaths. The spread was rapid and by the end of May the number increased to 500 deaths in one week, in spite of precautionary measures being adopted to stamp it out, and to prevent it being imported into Kuwait. On the 11 th June Major Cox was able to report that the epidemic was decreasing, and on the 19th July announced that Bahrain had been officially declared to be free from plague. On the 2nd January, Sir C. Spring Bice addressed a note to the G rand Persian claims. Vazir reminding him that as the agreement of 30th August 1S22 quoted by him in support of the Persian claims to the sovereignty of Bahrain was entire ly contrary to the views of the British Government, letters were, at the time, written to the Prince of Shiraz disallowing the treaty in strong terms, and announcing the recall of Captain Bruce who had been responsible for it. On the 5th February the Grand Vazir replied that the agreement had been effected between the officials of the two Governments, and that the abrogation of it was not known to the Persian Government who considered it binding. In his letter of the 23rd February Sir C. Spring Bice expressed prise that the Persian Government knew nothing of the agreement, and that they considered it binding. He remarked that no ment between nations was binding until it bad been formally ratified by the proper authorities. According to the information in bis possession, and which was doubtless also to be found in the archives of the lersian Foreign office, not onlv had the treaty been disavowed by the proper representations of His Majesty’s Government, but His Majesty the Shah had refused to recognise its stipulations and had expressed his displeasure that the 1 nnce of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government withou his knowledge or instructions. On the 10th August the Grand Yazir in acknowledging the above letter pointed out that even if the agreement of 1822 had not been put into execu- tion it did not affect the object of the Briris^ Gove^' agreement in question, since the responsible officials of the Biitiffi Govern ment at that time had recognised the position of the island and the ng i s Persia over it. In replying on the 13th August Sir C. Spring Rice pointed out that accord- in- to documents in the possession of His Majesty s government not only he Snerior British authority, but the Shah of Persia had expressly disavowed the action of their subordinate officials in 1822, and consequently accord mg to the law and practice of civilised nations those proceedings were null and void.

Insult to British Officers. El Hasa. On the 7th April Major Cox reported that letters destined for Hasa were being sent in sealed bags in charge of an Arab courier by .British India steamer from Basrah to Bahrain, and thence by native boat to Ojair. It appeared on enquiry that the overland route via Kuwait had been abandoned in favour of this one, presumably in consequence of Shaikh Mubarak’s refusal to give the Turks a guarantee for the safety of their mails in his territory. El Qatif. On the 24tli June, Major Cox telegraphed that having received informa tion that the notorious pirate Ahmad-bin-Salman had encamped in the desert near Qatif, he had arranged with the Senior Naval Officer for the despatch of the Lapwing ” to discuss with the Kaimmakam in a friendly manner what steps could be taken to check the pirate. The Commander and Lieutenant of the vessel landed on the 21 st June to call on the Kaimmakam, but were stopped at the gate of the town by the Turkish Port Officer and the Customs Officer, who insolently told them that the Kaimmakam would not see them, and that they had no right to land. They refused to take any message to the Kaimmakam and hustled the two officers; their attitude was so hostile that the officers returned to their ship. The incident was reported by the Government of India to the Secretary of State with the hope that suitable notice would bo taken by His Majesty’s Government of the action of the Turkish officials. On the 19th July instructions were issued by His Majesty’s Government to Sir N. O'Conor to draw the serious attention of the Ottoman Government to the discourtesy of the local officials whose action bad practically amounted to sheltering the pirate. He was also to express the hope that immediate and categorical instructions would be issued with a view to the prevention of similar incidents in the future. On the 19th August Sir N. O’Conor addressed a note verbale in the above sense to the Sublime Porte. Seemingly this produced no result, and on the 17th Becember Sir N. O’Conor was instructed to inform the Porte that the incident would not he regarded as closed until a formal apology was made to the Com mander of the ‘ Lapwing’ by the offending officials. Movements of The following Turkish troops were moved from Basrah to Qatif at the end Turk sh Troops, of an) j beginning o£ , his year -St!I December 1906—about 270 men with tents and military stores com- manded by Bimbashi Abdul Kadir Effendi. 15th January 1907—about 615 men with large quantities of stores and tents, belonging to two battalions commanded by Bimbashis Tahir and Rahim Effendi. 21st February 1907—about 370 men commanded by Bimbashi Ahmed Beg and 35 artillerymen without guns; also a new General Officer Commanding named Yusuf Pasha, and a Colonel named Said Beg. El Qutr. poly ?s7omrds T With the approval of the Secretary of State for India, the Government of Piracy, India on the 2tth February deliaed their policy in regard to the suppression o piracy in the Gulf briefly as follows : — Many of tne chiefs on the coast are hound to abstain from maritime war, ant it is both the light and duty of the Government of India to demand redress107 from these cltiefs in the event of acts of piracy being committed hy their subiects It is further their duty to obtain redress for the subjects of the^e chiefs when they suffer injuries by sea at the hands of other Arabs unconnected with the British Government. In order to free the sea from pirates the British Government may find it necessary to take action against such tribes in the interests of every one for the preservation of the maritime peace of the Gulf. The British Government had a right to take action hy sea in all cases for the suppression of piracy in territorial waters of the Qatr Coast. The question of action by land was, however, different. The Turkish Government had claimed supremacy over the Qatr peninsula and resented any action by British officers which might appear to disregard this claim. Although the British Government did not recognise Turkish sovereignty on the Arabian Coast below Ojair, yet occasions frequently arose when it was desirable to avoid offending Turkish susceptibilities, if British interests could be adequately defended witliom doing so, and it was desirable, therefore, that when action was taken against tribes on the Qatr peninsula, the British Govern ment should he in a position, if necessary, to support it on the ground that British interests were involved. It was advisable that the Government should not be involved in hostilities against any of the Qatr tribes without due deli beration, as unexpected complications might result. Practically, the Government of India consider every ease necessitating action on land on the Qatr coast should be referred to them for orders. ustlei Is Jietarf o[ Hajestb tie aleis n tie HI s incite i tie to' it tie'eel i Ealf ImeJBff fnraefli ai ressioa o Kuwait. On the 9th October 1906, Major Cox telegraphed that the Shaikh had Rental of Kuwait stated in an interview with Major Knox that the Germans, armed with docu- Foreshore * ments from the Sultan, had vainly endeavoured to acquire from him first Umm Qasr, then Kathama, and finally Bandar Shwaikh. In February 1907, the Political Besident stated that the Shaikh was willing to cede a strip of foreshore measuring 600 yards in length by 100 in depth wherever Government liked to select it. The Shaikh was willing to sell the land outright, but would prefer to receive a yearly quit rent. Major Cox suggested that the first offer to the Shaikh should be Ks. 60,000 as sale price, or III 2,400 as rent, and recommended that the Political Agent should make an offer of a yearly grant, taking Rs. 15,000 as an outside limit. After certain correspondence between the Home and India Governments, the Secretary of State on the 23rd July telegraphed that Major Knox should continue negotiations for the purchase, though the amount of land to be acquited was not necessarily to be limited to the dimensions mentioned, nor to be governed by the maximum price recommended hy Major Cox. On the 14th August Major Knox reported that Shaikh Mubarak was willing to grant for a perpetual rent of Rs. 60,0u0 a year a i octangular plot 3,750 yards along the sea face by 300 yards in depth at Bandai Shwaikh. The Shaikh reserved a plot 150 yards square in the centre of the reservation lore he had built a small coal shed. The Briiish Government would have a dit to all the foreshore facing the grant (except the portion opposite the laikh’s enclave) extending to a depth of 3 fathoms at lowest spring ti es. arious minor details are omitted ; but on the 28th August the Government India wired to the Secretary of State asking to be allowed to make the best rms they could. They stated that they -would try also to fix a price and rent r Shwaikh Island and Kathama in case it was desired to secure thesp hereafter. ; was also pointed out to the Secretary of State that while the concession secured ie port of Kuwait, it did not, however, close Khor Abdullah ^foreign aterprise, so they suggested it might even he possible to secure a right of iture pre-emption at a fixed price over Warbah Island, and tne anchorages to ic north and south of it.On the 2nd October the Secretary of State telegraphed authorising the conclusion of the agreement with the Shaikh for the lease of the rectangular nlot at a yearly rental of Es. 60,000. The proposal to acquire sites other than at Bandar Shwaikh was to be held over pending its full examination by His Majesty’s Government. The agreement was concluded on the 15th October; but owing to a mis- understanding on the part of the Political Agent it included a clause giving a right of pre-emption to the entire island of Warbah, situated near Khor Abdullah, and its surrounding foreshore. Action of Shaikh On the 5th September tbe Government of India called the attention of the Mubarak in Baui Secretary of State to the action of the Shaikh of Kuwait in taking part in an Turuf rebellion. e(iiti Q a organised by the Shaikh of Muhammareh against his rebellious tribesmen, the Bani Turuf, in order to compel them to pay their revenue. About the middle of June Shaikh Mubarak proceeded to Muhammareh^ in his steam yacht, taking with him a large quantity of arms, and ammunition and other articles which he handed over to Shaikh Khazal, and then sent his vessel hack for a second consignment. He also arranged to garrison the Muhammareh outpost of Kasbeh with his own men, to free the Arab garrison for service with the field force. The operations resulted in the defeat and surrender of the Bani Turuf. The Government of India observed that by conveying arms and ammuni tion up the Shatt-al-Arab in his private yacht, without the permission of the Persian Government, Shaikh Mubarak had run the risk of involving himself in serious difficulties with that Government or with, the Turkish authorities, which might have led to diplomatic complications. Moreover, the possibility of a coalition between these two Shaikhs, and the formation of a confederacy of Arab Shaikhs led by them, in order to secure their independence of foreign dominion, had not escaped the attention of the Govern ment of India. They accordingly suggested that a formal agreement to the effect that the external relations of Kuwait should be in the hands of the British Government might with advantage he entered upon with the Shaikh. If this proposal was not approved it was suggested the Shaikh should be informed that the Government of India had taken strong exception to his recent expedition in Arabistan, and unless he sought and was guided by their advice they would not be able to exercise their good offices on his behalf. On the 8 tli October the Secretary of State replied that no action should be taken at present, but it would be a matter for consideration, on the conclusion of the foreshore negotiations, whether the warnings given the Shaikh in 1901 and 1904 should not be repeated. InterfereocQ ifi Najd Affairs, Importation of Arms. In September Shaikh Mubarak had informed the Political Agent that he proposed to send a messenger to keep the peace between Bin Sa’ud and Bin Bashid in Najd, by guaranteeing the former in possession of his territory, the latter in that of Hail, and the independence of Al-Qasim against both, and to persuade the Bedouins of both sides to abandon war. With the approval of the Secretary of State Shaikh Mubarak was warned against interfering with Najd affairs, which would be certain to involve him in political difficulties. During the year under review there has been a considerable amount of trade in arms and ammunition between Masqat and Kuwait; and in the month of March alone it is estimated that 4,000 rifles were imported by country boat and steamer, the bulk of the arms going to the Muntafik in Irak ; whilst from the 1st to 19th October 6,000 rifles and ammunition were imported into Kuwait. The total value of the trade of Kuwait for 1906 amounted to Bs. 81,19,149 as against Bs. 58,72,251 of the previous year. Of this trade about 45 per cent, was with India and the United Kingdom. The increase in imports (Rs. 16, 78, 244) is largely due to the fact that country sailing boats carried Its. 13,00,000 worth of arms and ammunition to Kuwait.In August a Monsieur Elbaz, nephew of Monsieur Goguyer of Masqat, proceeded thence to Kuwait for the purpose of carrying on traffic in arms somewhere in the zone of British influence. Shaikh Mubarak was told that Monsieur Goguyer was a spy and that none of his people ought to be allowed at Kuwait. Monsieur Elbaz, however, remained at Kuwait for a considerable time and remitted large sums of money to the Erench Bank in Bombay, before he proceeded to Bahrain in November. Masqat. After prolonged discussion regarding the number of dhows entitled to fly the Erench flag, and the extent of that Power’s jurisdiction over these dhows, Eis Majesty’s Government informed M. Gambon on the 6 th August that they were willing to accept the Erench reservations as to— ( 1 ) The finality of M. Laronce’s opinion after a fresh examination of the list of dhows and flag holders ; (2) The jurisdiction of the Erench Consul over crimes committed by an Omani on the high seas while sailing in a dhow flying the Erench flag; and (3) The status of the 6 Zanzibari dhow holders. Thev were also willing to agree to the clause respecting the grant of the right to fly the Erench flag toMasqatis in the service of French citizens resident in Oman, provided that the interpretation of this clause, as given in M. Gambon’s memorandum of the 26th April, was formally accepted by the Erench Government: and on the understanding that natives navigating dhows entitled to fly the flag under this arrangement would have no other privileges than those conceded to masters and crews of dhows, entitled under the award to fly the Erench flag, unless they came under the category of persons actually m the service of the Erench.” . . , _ r , , The Erench Government were asked to instruct their c0 ^ s ^ Masqa o furnish annually to his British colleague a ^P^atelist ° d ^ 0 ' n 9 '; w “ d French citizens, as well as a list of persons entitled to fly the hrench lla 0 , m return for similar lists which would be furnished to him by His Majesty Consul.

ArmThe Secretary of State replied on the 24th April that His Majesty’s Gov ernment did not consider the present an opportune moment for representations on the subject to other Powers. The collection of statistics was, however, to be continued with a view to the submission of the necessary recommendations to the ^Brussels Arms Confer* ence to be held in 1908. On the 16th December the Secretary of State telegraphed that the prelimin ary meeting of the Conference would assemble early in February 1908, and that French, German, and Italian representatives would be present. Informa tion was asked for to place before the Conference. A few days later Mr. Morley telegraphed that the Italian Government pro posed sending an Agent to Masqat to organise a service of information^ on the illicit traffic in arms, and requested that all assistance should be given him. The Masqat trade report for 1906-07 shows a large increase in the value of imports and exports, chiefly due to the unprecedented rise in the value of the arms trade, which had reached a higher figure than ever before, and exceeded that for 1905-06 by 56 per cent. Throughout the year under review large consignments of arms and ammu nition are reported almost weekly to have been landed at Masqat from Europe ; and many successful gun-running operations between that port and. various points along the Makran coast are recorded, into the details of which it is im possible to enter within the scope of this summary. That this traffic is highly lucrative, and exists practically unchecked, owing to the inability of our gun boats to obtain timely warning w here landings are to be made, admits of no doubt. It is hoped, however, that new schemes which have lately been put into practice along the Persian littoral between Jashk and Chahbar may result in important captures, which hitherto have been conspicuous by their absence. The Somaliland Mulla is reported to have despatched agents to Masqat during the year to obtain arms and ammunition from the Oman Coast. The naval authorities in their search for these arms in September were subjected to hostile treatment at the hands of the natives inhabiting the vicinity of Kadereh, for which punishment was meted out to them by the Sultan, who imprisoned one of the principal offenders and reprimanded the inhabitants. in The interior of Oman has been the scene of many petty conflicts during the year between the various tribes and sections occupying those districts, which have in consequence remained in a very disturbed state. On the 12 th February Major Grey reported that Wali Sulaiman-bin- Suwailim, the most valued retainer of the Sultan of Masqat, had been murdered while on his return journey from Sharqiyah to Masqat. The Sultan was much perturbed and feared he might be obliged to hand over everything to us in the event of a general rising against him. He then dispatched 200 men under his sons, Timur and Nadir, to Bibdid in the Wadi Semayil, with orders to hold the fort against possible attacks. The murderers it seems belonged to the Siyabiyin, a Ghafiri tribe, and they had murdered the Wali because, during the hostilities with the Bani Riyam last year, he had intercepted a caravan carrying supplies from the Siyabiyin to the enemy. On the 8 th July Major Grey reported that Shaikh Saif-bin-Mohsin-as-Siyabi the Chief of the Siyabiyin tribe had been assassinated at Nafaa, in retaliation for the murder of the late Wali. Abu Musa. This small island lying nearly midway between Eingeh and Sharjah, off the Arabian coast, has assumed a position of some prominence owing to the discussion which has arisen between the German and British Governments regarding a concession granted for the mining of red oxide to a German sub ject, Herr Wonckhaus. In 1898 the Shaikh of Sharjah granted a lease of theIll red oxide mines to one Haji Hasan ,bin Ali Samaiyeh, a resident of Lingeh, Ms son Abdullah, and a third person,Isa bin Abdul Latif. In February 1905, it was reported that Herr Wonckhaus contemplated visitiuo* Abu Musa with a view to taking up the export of red pxide, and the concessionaires were warned against entering into any compact with the German firm. The Shaikh had received a general warning in 1898 not to grant trade monopolies without consulting the Political Resident in the Gulf. Neverthe less in June 1906 Hasan, claiming to act for his two partners, granted Herr Wonckhaus a monopoly of the output of the red oxide for a period of lour years, with preferential option to renew the contract at the end of that period. In reporting the matter Major Cox pointed out the political importance of preventing the acquisition by Germany of vested rights in the Gulf, and urged that an attempt should be made to extinguish the concpion. Ihe Govern ment of India agreed, and requested Major Cox to ascertain from the Shaikh of Shariah whether Hasan had any authority from him to enter into this contract. On the 28th February Major Cox replied that neither the Shaikh nor the third partner, Isa, were willing that the agreement should stand, and the Shaikh, moreover in view of Hasan’s unauthorised action, had decided to withdraw the concession from the three concessionaires, and make other arrangements for the working of the mines—Major Cox suggested with Messrs. F. C. Stnck &amp; Lo. On the 8th April the Government of India instructed Major Cox that any made should not come into force until the end of the year, which would enable Messrs. Wonckhaus to fulfil any subsidiary contracts they may have made for the supply of red oxide. Hasan was to he informed but the Political Resident was to be careful to assume no responsibility for the action already taken by the Shaikh. On the 21st May, Major Cox reported that the Sha i^ of ,^ ar ^ h , 1 J i ad rvmn to Abu Musa island to stop further mining operations , but on tHe ^rct men to Vip ai .q from the Shaikh that Hasan had rein- begged that Government would either arrange the business or advise him, as the concessionaire was a British subject.

No opposition had been offered, although the concessionaire and Herr Wonckhaus had written to the Shaikh advising him to withdraw his notice, and threatening to send men to protect their property. The concessionaire had also threatened the Shaikh with retaliation by the German Government. The Shaikh’s guard of 30 men had been left on the island and the gun boat was to return to observe further proceedings. On the 28th October, Lieutenant Gabriel telegraphed that he had received a report from Lingeh that Mr. Brown, the legal representative of Herr Wonck haus, accompanied by the concessionaire and about 28 men, had visited Abu Musa on the 22nd October. Mr. Brown had taken with him a German flag to place on the accumulated oxide ; but the Shaikh’s guard refused to allow him to land. In spite of repeated warnings he persisted in approaching and as he neared the shore the guard fired two shots in the air to deter him. On his ex postulating and assuring them that he only wished to see how matters stood, two of his men were allowed to land and see all they wished, when they were escorted back to the boat. Thereupon, Mr. Brown sailed back to Lingeh, Herr Wonckhaus has appealed to the German Government, who have taken the matter up, and, at the time of writing, considerable diplomatic correspond ence is taking place, on the subject of the concession, between the British and German Governments, the ultimate result of which is not yet known. Pending the decision the German Government have been informed that the accumulated oxide may be removed, and that no fresh mining will be proceeded with. ffajd. The course of events in Najd during the year is shrouded in a great deal of uncertainty, as the reports regarding the internecine struggle between the Bin Saud and Bin Rashid factions for the mastery of Najd are of so contradictory a nature that it is difficult to arrive at an accurate understanding of the real state of affairs. At the end of 1906 all Turkish sovereignty had been blown to the winds, owing to the succession of defeats they had suffered at the hands of the Arabs. Najd was evacuated by them in consequence, with the assistance of Bin Saud. Metaab bin Rashid, who had succeeded his father when the latter was killed in a fight with Bin Saud, in the previous May, was in turn murdered by his cousin, Sultan—in circumstances of the most appalling cold-blooded treachery,—early in December 1906. Sultan bin Rashid then assumed the title of Amir of Najd, and is said to have been confirmed as ruler by the Sultan of Turkey. He wrote also to Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait placing himself at his disposal, and asking for his protection and friendship. In January it was reported that Bin Saud had quarrelled with Bin Rashid, alleging that the latter had disregarded his engagement to abstain from inter fering with places outside his territorial limits by attacking a party of Be douins in the vicinity of Medina. In March the Shaikh of the Sebay tribe visited Shaikh Mubarak to seek his protection, as he had broken off his alliance with Bin Saud, who was reported to have proceeded on a raid against the Sham mars of Bin Rashid’s faction. The latter, however, being fore-warned are said to have collected in great ^strength to resist him, and Bin Saud turned back to Buraidah. During the week ending 11 th April news was received that Sultan Bin Rashid, supported by a force of some 2,800 Bedouins, Anizah from the north, and Shammar was at Ghaffa ready to attack Bin Saud, who was at Gasaiba with only 700 men. Later news the same month reported an important engagement between Bin Saud and Bin Rashid near Qasim. One account stated that Bin Saud’s force had been annihilated, and that he alone had escaped ; whereas another account describes how Sultan was surprised, his army utterly routed, and Bin113 Sand having seized Hail had entered the fortress of the Rashid family, from which he had plundered all their jewellery, arms and ammunition. Sultan was reported to have fled to a village near Salma close to Jabal Sham mar. Similar contradictory reports were received during May. From Muham- mareh it was stated that Bin Saud having claimed revenue from the Harb tribe, Sultan bin Rashid objected and, assisted by the Harb, advanced from Hail and surprised and defeated Bin Saud. At the same time news received at Baghdad confirmed this inasmuch that Bin Rashid was reported to have been successful in obtaining possession of Buraidah and Anaizah ; Bin Saud was said to have been wounded, and the losses on both sides to have been very heavy. Later in the month news was received that peace had been made between Bin Saud and Bin Rashid ; but in June rumours were current that Bin Rashid had been killed by his brother; and that Bin Sand had gone to Riyadh, whence he hurried back to punish the people of Buraidah, who were reported to be intri guing with Rashid. ^ _ In August the reports regarding Rashid’s murder were contradicted, and he was stated to be about to enter Buraidah in force. This he appears to have done on the 17th and to have established friendly relations with the inhabitants. Bin Sand was then at A1 Athla, two days south of Auaizah, waiting re-inforce» merits from his brother. j , _ , * T ^i • r Early in September Bin Saud was said to have withdrawn to Kliarj , but later in the month reports were received that the combined forces of Anizah and Bass, the allies of Bin Sand, bad recently been engaged in a sharp fio-ht with Bin Rashid outside Buraidah, m which the latter was defeated. Shortly after Bin Saud arrived, entered Buraidah, and took immediate action' to punish the party which was said to be in secret compact with Bin Rashid. He then appointed an Amir and left for the Shammar country m pur suit of Sultan. Another version, probably the correct one, is that Bin bau with his Ataibah was attacked at night four hours east of Buraidah by the forces of Bin Rashid, Buraidah and the TJmtair. The U rotair went for the Ataibah and took 18 mares and the bulk of their riding camels, and the townsmen attacked. Bin Saud for two hours, killing several of his family. Bin Saud then seiit foi help to Anaizah, but these were attacked en route, suffering heavily attic hands of the Buraidah. The two forces were still said to be opposing each other and Rashid had gone to fetch his Shammar from Gasaiba. « a»&lt; •• 'to horseThad^beerfkaied and Bin Rashid’s loss was i 7 men killed.

Brft^h t? ° n Pro^ec Events on the whole appear to have been fairly peaceful within our borders torate. throughout 1907. and the Mulla is apparently desirous of observing his obliga tions towards us, and to refrain from raiding the tribes under British protection. Frequent reports point to the fact that he has for long been making efforts to enlist the sympathy of the Warsangli, who occupy the north-eastern portion of the Protectorate; but no trustworthy information is available as to how far he has been successful. Situation in Elsewhere, outside our borders, the year’s record is a chronicle of a series land 3 ” Somah ' of raids and counter-raids amongst the various factions who own allegiance to, or who are opposed to, the Mulla’s regime. Within the compass of this summary it is impossible to give any connected account of the raids, which appear to be of almost daily, or at least weekly, occurrence in Somaliland From all reports, the Mulla, whose personal head-quarters have remained throughout the greater part of the year in the vicinity of Illig on the coast, is w^ell supplied with arms, though his supply of ammunition is regarded as small. A principal feature of his policy is to keep peace with the British Government while maintaining petty warfare with such outside tribes as the Mijjarten and Ogaden, who can be raided and looted with impunity. Lately, however, the activity of one Yusuf Ali, and the combination of the Northern and Southern Mijjarten, have seriously affected his position; but the Ogaden he has always regarded as his most promising looting grounds. The Ogaden are hopelessly disorganised, are scattered over a great area, and so are incapable of co-operation and thus usually fall an easy prey to the raiders. The Mulla can always count upon the support of the Bargheri, and provided the Dervishes can keep far enough away from our tribes, and out of reach of the Abyssinians, they have nothing to fear. These constant raids on the Ogaden and Mijjarten have so sickened these unfortunate tribesmen that they are desirous of seeking British protection; but as they are Italian subjects it cannot be extended to them. Abyssinian Somaliland. In August it was reported that the Abyssinians, whose Ogaden subjects had been raided, had taken the field against the Somalis and had inflicted a severe defeat on the Bargheri near Faf on the Tag Fafan. Another Abyssinian force w as stated to be fitting out at Harrar to co-operate with the one already in the Ogaden country. It left on the 12th September 3,500 strong, to punish the Bagheri for having looted the Ba Awadleh. In October it was reported that the first expedition under Fitarari Gabri had been attacked and defeated by the Hawiya : and that the second under Fitarari Abanabro had been w iped out by the Bagheri. A relieving column, 5,000 strong, under the command of bdtarari Ayaleh, was then despatched from Harrar. At the close of the year no official intelligence was forthcoming as regards the above alleged disasters; but information from native sources pointed to the fact that the Abyssinians ’had on the contrary, been successful in their engagements, and that the Bagheri were fleeing in the direction of Galadi and Badvvein en route to obtain the protection of the Mulla. 1 Fak, b hvo i it ’if n In December news was received that a force of some 2,000 Abyssinians Territory 0 a lan ^ raided into Italian territory on the Juba River, and that a sharp* en^a°-e- ment had taken place between the raiders and Italian troops in whitfii consider able loss on both sides had resulted. Representations were at once made to the Emperor Menelek by the Italian Government demanding compensation for the outrage and the punishment of the Chief responsible for this unwarranted aggression on the terrhory of a friendly Power. Menelek denied all knowledge of the raid, which had been carried out without his authority, promised com pensation and the punishment of the frontier Chief who had embarked on the enterprise. Italian re-inforcements were hurried up to Lugli on the Juba, which apparently had suces-fully resisted the attack; but the Abyssinians Lad with drawn north. Additional troops were also pushed up to Bardera on the Juba by the Italians, but no further aggression seems to have taken place. It would appear not unlikely that these raiders were portions of the forces seat out by the Abyssinians to operate against the Somalis. JEarly in thn year 1'vo Frenchmen out shooting about 10 miles from Jibuti Fr were murdered by members ot the Bssa tribe. A punitive expedition was contem- Und plated by the French authomxes, but in April the unrest was reported to be sub- siding, and the expedmon was abandoned. Later the prisoners taken in con nection with the above outrage escaped from custody, and a police force, 15 strong, with 2 white men, was sent to arrest some people implicated in the murder at Hambulli, 20 miles from Jibuti. They succeeded in arresting two men, including the brother of one of the men guilty of the murder • but on their return march they were attacked by the Essa with the result that the two prisoners escaped and one of the police sepoys was killed. This occurred in November; M. Li garde was shortly expected back, when it was hoped the matter would be satisfactorily settled. French Somali- In August it was reported that the Jibuti-Dire Dawa Railway Company was in a state of liquidation, and that the bmperor JMenelek declined to re cognise any claims made by the French Minister to run the railway as a Gov ernment concern. An agreement wns concluded during the early part of the year between the a n g i o-ltaiian British and Italian Governments whereby disputes in future between tribes A£reement ‘ under their respective protection will be settled by officials on the spot, or in case of dis igreement by the two Governments, all communications between the British authorities and the Mulla parsing through the agency of the Italian authorities. 'I he agreement also modifies the limits of grazing rights, which are a constant.source of dispute. The British Government also pays the sum of £t,000 to the Mijjarten tribes protected by Italy as an indemnity for losses suffered during the campaign against the Mulla. The agreement further sanctions a mutual entente cordiale between the two Protectorates with reference to custom duties, the patrolling of the coast line, and the establishment of harmony in any punitive measures which may be justified. Bandar Ziade is still to he included in the Italian Protectorate, in spite of it being west of the 4Dth meridian east of Greenwich which is the boundary of the Italian Pro tectorate. An agreement was signed in London on the 13th December 1906 by which Arms Traffic. Great Britain, Prance and Italy bind themselves to exercise a rigorous supervi sion over the importation of arms and ammunition:— The French Government at Jibuti and Obok in the territories of French Somaliland. The British Government in British Somaliland and the ports and terri tories of Zeila, Berbera, Aden and Perim. The Italian Government in Frithrea, Italian Somaliland, and more especially in the ports of Massowah and Assab. The three Governments also engaged to make joint representations to the Negus with a view to the prohibition of the traffic iu arms and ammunition in Abyssinian territory. In June it was estimated the Mulla possessed from 1,000 to 1,500 rifles, and, owing to the surveillance over the sea-borne traffic in arms by Italy and England, was mainly depeniient on the overland traffic from Jibuti to Abys sinian Somaliland, and thence through the Bagheri country, for his supply of arms and ammunition. The Emperor Menelek, on representation being made to him, promised to check this traffic in the Arussi country which seems to be the chief medium of supply. The importation and sale of arms in Jibuti was still a flourishing trade, the majority of the arms apparently following the route above mentioned with tno connivance of the Abyssinian officials, if not actually encouraged by them. In August reports were received that an a rent of the Mulla had^ gone to Masqat to obtain ammunition, and it appeared that 10 months previously some Rs. 15,000 worth were purchased in Masqat and conveyed Lorn fenr to Somaliland under French flag in a Kadareh dhow. In September the Political Agent at Masqat received information that some 300 rifles had been sent from Masqat and 100 from Snr to Kadareh, and R. M. S. ophinxproceeded both to Sur and Kadareh to search for them. No Somalis were found at Sur, but at Kadareh the man of war met with a hostile reception, to which reference has already been made (See Masqat, Arabia.) In November it was reported that a had just left Sur for Somali’ land with 22,000 cartridges concealed amongst 160 packages of dates ; hut though the information was passed on the vessel appears to have successfully eluded capture. In addition to Jibuti it is stated that arms are a 1 so introduced into Somali land through the Italian port at Raheita—their nearest post being at Assab. Reports are current that the Northern Mijjarten, and the Gadwein tribes on tbe north- eastern frontier manufacture their own ball cartridges. They buy caps and powder, and cast the bullets themselves in improvised moulds. ABYSSINIA. Mission. There would appear to be little of particular importance to chronicle with regard to events in Abyssinia during the year under review. There seems to be considerable activity, however, on the part of Foreign Powers, in despatching missions to the Court of the Negus, presumably with the object of obtaining various concessions from the Emperor, in order to exploit the country. In this respect Germany is displaying noteworthy zeal in her attempts to establish close commercial relations with Abyssinia, and to obtain the same predominant in fluence in that country, which she has contrived to secure in the Ottoman Empire, to the detriment of all competitors. One German Mission under Doctor Bosch, who was a member of Doctor Rosen’s Mission in 1905 arrived in Abyssinia in April of this year ; and barely has it returned than information is received, at the close of the year, of the depar ture of a most important mission headed by Herr Arnold Holtz. It is stated the German Emperor, the Imperial Chancellor, several leading banks, and a number of German financiers, are taking a keen interest in the efforts of this Mission. Its aims and objects are of a most ambitious nature, and include proposals for obtaining a concession to establish a service of motor cars between Adis Abeba and Dire-Dawa, the present terminus of the Jibuti Railway. The dis tance from the capital to this point is approximately 800 miles, and it is anticipated a regular motor service for passengers and freight would produce substantial profit. In tbe second place, it is proposed to ask for the monopoly in spirits, 10 % of the annual profits to be offered to the Emperor as an inducement to grant the concession. Permission to establish a German bank at Adis Abeba will also be applied for, and orders for arms and ammunition for Messrs. Ehrhardt and Company will be sought. Should the above projects be favourably entertained by the Negus other schemes are to hand to complete the Germanisation of Abyssinia. The utmost secrecy as to the nature of Herr Holtz’s party has been observed, and they appear to have disguised themselves as sportsmen in quest of big game shooting, throughout their journey from Europe to Jibuti. It is of interest to note in this connection that in July an order was srazet- ted in Berlin withdrawing the prohibition on export of arms and ammunition to Abyssinia. Menelek's aim is to be at peace with all the world, and to get as much orei s n advantage as possible out of his deals with Foreign Powers, while paying as little as need be for it. He seeks no alliance with any single State, for the mere weight of such an alliance would compel him to follow the counsel of that State’s Representative, and thus he would lose that independence of action within his owm kingdom which he values so greatly. His one fear is a combination of Great Britain, France and Italy, due to Abyssinia’s geographical position in relation to territories1X7 of those Powers : and he might be inclined therefore to welcome an assurance fromGermanyor America, say, that they would use their best endeavours to prevent such a combination, in return for certain concessions. At the present day Great Britain probably stands first as the Power with whom the maintenance of good relations is of the greatest importance to Abys sinia. Prance probably comes next, thanks chiefly to the Jibuti Railway, and the facilities given for the import of arms Then Italy, for the Colony of Erythrsea always makes trouble in the turbulent northern provinces of Abyssinia. Germany threatened at one time to be a factor of great weight, but her capacity for thwarting others has been greatly weakened by the Tripartite Agreement, and also by the complete failure of Herr Bosch’s Mission. In spite of this unfortunate beginning, however, Germany (as has been recorded above) is again striving to establish her influence in the country—and should Menelek begin to feel the pressure of the Tripartite Agreement, it seems certain he will turn to Germany for support, and seek to make her the most influential Power in Abyssinia. Reference has already been made (see Somaliland) to the raid by Abyssi- nians into Italian territory, for which the Emperor has promised complete satisfaction, so no diplomatic difficulties are likely to rise in connection with that incident. As a matter of fact, Menelek has little authority over the chiefs or tribes on the outskirts of his dominion, who frequently indulge in raids not only into British territory to the south, but also on the western borders into the Sudan. On several occasions during the year under review such raids have been reported, and the Abyssinian officials concerned have been addressed on the subject—usually with but little result. The action undertaken by the Abyssinians in dealing with Somali raids has already been dealt with under Somaliland. At the end of October it was reported that Abyssinia had formed a cabinet Abyssinian on European lines. A decree was issued towards the close of the year by the Emperor, enjoin ing compulsory education on all male children over the age of 12. The edu cation is to be provided by the State, and several Coptic teachers have been engaged in Egypt : whilst the building of schools is being rapidly proceeded with. At the beginning of the year it was roughly calculated*that the number Abysaiman^ mm- of men Menelek could put into the field, under their respective commanders, tary orces ' was as follows :— King Menelek’s own troops (including 80 to 90 guns and 10,000 Irregular Cavalry) Has Michaprs army (mostly spear armed Galla horsemen) Ras Walda Giorgis army Has Tasamma Dejaz lima Dejaz Lul Sagad Dejaz Lamma Dejaz Birru ... Ras Mangasha Attakem Ras Guksa Various Chiefs in Tigre Other Minor Chiefsand various other native tribes, would certainly seize the occasion to revolt. The greater part of the soldiers are armed with Gras rifles, for which there are enormous reserve stores of ammunition in secret places all over the country ; but most of the Abyssinians are very poor shots and take little care of their rifles. Menelek’s own troops are the only ones in which any attempt is made to organise the force into infantry, cavalry and artillery. The other armies are merely masses of loosely-disciplined mounted infantry (mounted on mules for the most part), and the number of horsemen among them is purely accidental. Menelek’s cavalry includes a body of about 5,000 men recruited on some what the same system as obtains in India. The Artillery consists of some 90 miscellaneous pieces, 50 of which were taken from the Italians at Adowa in 1896, the rest being principally machine guns, colts, maxims, mitrailleuses, etc., either bought or given to the King as presents. Nearly all the guns are parked in King Menelek’s residence under charge of special troops ; hut they would be of little account in a campaign as the gunners never have any drill or practice. The Abyssinian army is extraordinarily mobile, hut as there is no system of transport or means of supplying food, it cannot keep the field for long ; and any country through which it passes is completely ravaged in consequence. In spite of a complete lack of discipline, judged from an European standard, there is a certain amount of cohesion in the seeming rabble on the line of march ; whilst in battle the soldier, though acting independently, usually follows his immediate officer and acts under his direction. Menelek knows his army is no match for trained troops in a regular cam paign ; hut he considers a large army insures his independence owing to the diffi culties of the country, and has no intention of using it for aggressive purposes. Death of Governor 0n tlie 10tl1 November Eejaz lima, a natural son of the late Kas Makunan, of Hairar. who, on his father’s death, had been appointed Governor of Harrar, died at Harrar, and was buried the same day. It is reported that he was poisoned like the late Kas. Mr. Eentiet’s Begley, who left Jibuti in a motor car at the end of August, with the Motor jcumey. intention of driving through Somaliland and Abyssinia to Khartoum, reached Adis Abeba at the end of the year. He had hoped to reach Khartoum in 10 days : hut as it appears to have taken him 3 months to reach Adis Abeha which is only half way, it may be inferred that the road is not suitable for motor traffic in its present condition.AFGHANISTAN. Political. A. External. The Amir arrived at Landi Kotal on the 2nd January. He was met on the frontier beyond and below Landi Khana by Sir H. McMahon and other officers who had been appointed to attend him throughout his tour, and by Major Roos-Keppel and other officers of the Khaibar Eifles. On this occasion his salute was raised to 31 guns, and it was decided to grant him the title of ' His Majesty ”, instead of “His Highness ” as heretofore, when necessary to use an English title. On the 3rd January he proceeded to Peshawar, where he halted for three days. He then travelled to Agra, halting at Nowshera and Rawal Pindi to see the garrisons, and at Sirhind to.visit a famous Muhammadan tomb. At Agra he was received by His Excellency the Viceroy, witnessed a review of 30,000 troops, and was invested with the insignia of the G. C. B. From Agra he went to Aligarh, where he made a thorough inspection of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, and expressed himself entirely satisfied with the education, both spiritual and intellectual, given to the students. He then visited Cawnpore, Gwalior—where he was most splendidly enter tained by the Maharaja Scindia—Delhi and Ajmere, and arrived at Calcutta on the morning of the 28th of January. Here he gave himself up entirely to sight seeing and social functions, in wdiich he delighted, so much so indeed that though a shooting trip in the vicinity of Sohagpur had been arranged for him, he insisted on abandoning it and spending the time allotted to it at Calcutta. From Calcutta he went to Bombay, where, among other things, he was shown some gunnery practice by ships of the Royal Navy, and the coast defence batteries. From Bombay be paid a short visit to Poona. On the 26th February the Amir embarked on board the Royal Indian Marine Steam Ship ‘‘ Dufferin ” for Karachi. From Karachi be returned by Lahore to Peshawar, and finally recrossed the frontier on the 7th of March. From the social aspect the tour was a success. His Majesty enjoyed it thoroughly, and was much impressed by all that he saw. He, too, mado a favourable impression on all who met him. The Afghan Sardars and others who accompanied the Amir took advan tage of their 5 visit to Calcutta to purchase a large number of small bore arms, especially automatic pistols* Some of these they sold to the tiihesmen of the Khaibar on their return. There is nothing particular to record regarding the Amir’s dealings with tribes inside the British border during 1907. The usual .P a ^ tie s Afridl j went to Kabul in the summer while the Amir was on tour m Afghanistan and were received by Sardar Nasrulla Khan. The usual allowances were paid and were in some cases increased. Every facility, and indeed encouragement, was given to the tribesmen to purchase rifles. The Mull a Powinda paid two visits to Kabul, and was received by the Amir on at least one occasion, but no tangible assistance uas given un. A mulla of Khost, known as Lala Pir, has been intriguing with the Mahsuds and Wazirs throughout the year. He, money Mulla Powinda, spread many wild stories regar ing assis . „ however and troops to be given to the tribesmen from Kabul No rifles, however, were forthcoming, and the Mulla Powinda on h’S econ explained that a? the Amir had induced the , Br,tlsh . fl ^ o y“ n “®f ui ;° d SlV0 1 the idea of an expedition against the Mahsuds, no nflts ne (1The importation of and trade in rifles throughout Afghanistan receives every encouragement from the Amir, who is said to have freed caravans of arms from all tolls and duties. One of the caravans on its way from the Persian Gulf to Afghanistan was intercepted on the Baluchistan border by a party of the Robat detachment and some levies. The escort to the caravan, said to consist of 50 well armed Afghans, fought hard, but were driven off, leaving behind them 794 rifles and 62,000 rounds of ammunition. The rifles were of many types, the one most largely represented being the British Govern ment Martini-Henry bearing the marks of several of the Australian Colonies. Enquiries regarding their origin are still proceeding. The Amir on hearing of this incident complained to the Viceroy of the “ lawlessness ” of the “ frontier officials ” in attacking the caravan, and expressed a hope that they would be punished and such “ raids ” prevented for the future. The reply to this protest has been delayed pending the receipt of a reply from the Amir to the communication concerning the Anglo-Russian Conven tion {vide infra). Large and increasing numbers of these caravan rifles are now finding their way into the hands of the tribes on our North-West Frontier, and the question has assumed such serious proportions as to engage the anxious consideration of the Government of India. On the 31st August 1907 an agreement regarding Anglo-Russian interests in Central Asia was concluded between Great Britain and Russia. The full text of the portion concerning Afghanistan is as follows • “ The High Contracting Parties, in order to ensure perfect security on their respective frontiers in Central Asia and to maintain in these regions a solid and lasting peace, have concluded the following Convention. Article I. His Britannic Majesty's Government declare that they have no intention of changing the political status of Afghanistan. His Britannic Majesty’s Government further engage to exercise their influence in Afghanistan only in a pacific sense, and they will not themselves take, nor encourage Afghanistan to take, any measures threatening Russia. The Russian Government, on their part, declare that they recognize Afghanistan as outside the sphere of Russian influence, and they engage that all their political relations with Afghanistan shall be conducted through the intermediary of His Britannic Majesty^ Government; they further engage not to send any Agents into Afghanistan. Article II. The Government of His Britannic Majesty having declared in the Treaty signed at Kabul on the 21st March 1905, that they recognize the Agreement and the engagements concluded with the late Ameer Abdur Rahman, and that they have no intention of interfering in the internal government of Afghan territory, Great Britian engages neither to annex nor to occupy in contraven tion of that Treaty any portion of Afghanistan or to interfere in the internal administration of the country, provided that the Ameer fulfils the engage ments already contracted by him towards His Britannic Majesty's Government under the above mentioned Treaty. Article III. The Russian and Afghan authorities, specially designated for the purpose on the frontier or in the frontier provinces, may establish direct relations with each other for the settlement of local questions of a non-political character. Article IV. ^ a j 0S ty’s Government and the Russian Government affirm icir adheience to the principle of equality of commercial opportunity in121 Afghanistan, and they agree that any facilities which may have been, or shall be hereafter, obtained for British and British-Indian trade and traders, shall be equally enjoyed by Russian trade and traders. Should the progress of trade establish the necessity for Commercial Agents, the two Governments will agree as to what measures shall be taken, due regard, of course, being had to the Ameer’s sovereign rights. Article V. The present arrangements will only come into force when His Britannic Majesty’s Government shall have notified to the Russian Government tho consent of the Ameer to the terms stipulated above The Amir, to whom the convention was duly communicated early in Sep tember has not yet signified his consent to the same, so that in accordance \yith Article V it is still inoperative. The British Agent at Kabul, Malik Khuda Bakhsh, Tiwana, accompanied the Amir to India and then resigned bis appointment. His successor was Rakir Saiyid Iftikhar«ud-din, Extra Assistant Commissioner in the Punjab and Revenue Member of Council, Tonk State. On the whole he has been well treated by the Amir, and accompanied His Majesty on his tour through his kingdom. He has resigned his post hut is still at Kabul, his successor not having yet been appointed, as the Amir took exception to the appointment of the Hon’ble Malik Umar Hayat Khan, Tiwana, C.I.E., who had been put forward by the Government of India as his successor, on the grounds of his being young and inexperienced. Muhammad Ali Khan Rana, British representative at Kandahar, has found his position somewhat difficult, and towards the end of the year, an accusation of improper conduct, apparently unfounded, was made against him by the Kotwal. Khan Bahadur Yakub Ali Khan, Hewswriter at Herat, resigned the post he had held for so many years, and was succeeded in February by Muhammad Aslam Khan, who has apparently maintained his predecessor’s good relations with the Herat authorities. 2?. Internal. The Amir’s visit to India and his extended tour throughout Afghanistan were the principal events which might have been expected to affect internal politics. The result of his visit to India so far appears to have been only partiallv satisfactory. Indeed, it may be doubted whether tbe Amir s personal position and popularity in bis kingdom have not deteriorated to a considerable extent during the year under review. Nor, at present, does it seem probable that tbe official Anglo-Afghan relations have been improved by tbe visit, or that it will result in tbe industrial development of Afghanistan. There were rumours of impending trouble due to tbe action of certain who unfavourably entertained tbe friendship formed by the Amir with His Excel lency the Viceroy, Lord Kitchener, and other British officials m India, and bitterly resented' bis joining the masonic fraternity. Nothing serious has, however, occurred up to the present. On the other hand his tour throughout his Kingdom appears to have given rise to a good deal of discontent partly on account of the heavy exaction in forced labour and compulsory contribution of money and supplies that the progress of an eastern potentate throughout bis dominions inevitably eausM, and partly on account of the disappointment caused when the sub J“ ts J, 0 '^ that the Amir was unable or unwilling to enquire personally into, and ledress, their various grievances. The chief feature of Kabul politics during 1907 appearance from public life of the once powerful Sarar _ nam Q Itimad’iid-daula. From the day that the Amir left Ka u even of the Prime Minister disappears from all reports from Kabul.Nasrulla Khan, on the other hand, has been the de facto ruler of Kabul throughout the greater part of the year, and his influence throughout the country has undoubtedly increased, as the Amir’s has perhaps diminished. This is a factor which will undoubtedly have to be reckoned with in future. The Amir after his return from India made no long stay in his capital. On the 8th May he started on his tour throughout his dominions. He was accompanied by his eldest son, ten Sardars, two native doctors and the British Agent, and escorted by 800 cavalry and a mountain battery. The march to Kandahar, 815 miles, was performed in 14 days. This rapid rate of travelling made the Amir somewhat seriously ill, and for the rest of the tour the marches were shorter. His Majesty left Kandahar on the 17th June and reached Herat on the 10th July. He remained there till the 17th August, when he left for Maimana which was reached on the 31st. Two days were spent there and the march was then resumed, Mazar-i-Sharif being reached on the 26th September. It is worthy of notice that the arrival of the Amir at Mazar-i-Sharif synchro nised with that of the Russian Governor General of Turkistan, and also with the communication to His Majesty of the terms of the Anglo Russian Conven tion. At Mazar he met his half brother Ghulam Ali Jan who has resided there ever since his birth and was nominally Governor of that Province. The Amir directed him and his mother to return to Kabul with the Royal party. Starting from Mazar-i-Sharif on the 20th October, and making short halts at Tash Kurghan, Haibak and Ghori, Ilis Majesty crossed the Khawak Pass, in two feet of snow, on the 15th November and reached Kabul on the 25th. This tour was no doubt of benefit to the Amir himself as it enabled him to see many parts of his dominions which he had never visited before, but it appears to have lessened his popularity. The inhabitants hoped for redress of their grievances and for other advantages from their King’s visit, but these were not, as a rule, fulfilled. One or two tyrannous officials were, it is true, removed or executed, but as a general rule the complaints of the people either did not reach the Amir, or if they did were not attended to. On the other hand an increased amount of forced labour on roads was imposed, and the col lection of supplies without payment, and the extortion of money for “ presents ” to the Amir were a heavy tax on the population. Nothing more has been heard regarding the proposed extension of irriga tion or the improvements in revenue administration, mentioned in last year’s Summary, nor does it seem probable, under the present re*actionary regime, that anything will be done. The e.r-Tahsildar, Qazi Muhammad Akbar, was deported from Afghanistan early in January. The Amir when in India expressed his intention of improving the Habibia College, but, so far as is known, nothing particular was done during 1907 in that direction. The repatriation of refugees still continues. There has been some increase in the number of British and Indian employes in Afghanistan. Mr. Hayden, of the Geological Survey of India, was engaged by the Amir in March to report on the mineral wealth of Afghanistan. He first inspected the coal seams in Ghorband, which he found to be valueless. Afterwards he travelled through Bamian, Saighan and Kamard, where he obtained many specimens of coal and iron, which have been sent to India for examination. He has had a most unpleasant life, owing to the studied insolence of the Afghan officials appointed to attend on him, and neither the Amir nor Nasrulla Khan appear to have done anything either to ameliorate his position or to expedite his vrork. Mr. Thornton, the tanner, has returned from Europe bringing with him new machinery and an English assistant.Messrs. Donovan and Halliday, engineers, are, it is believed, engaged in the erection of an iron bridge, supplied by Burn and Co. of Howrah, over the Kabul river below Darunta. Two chauffeurs, an Englishman and a Musalman, were engaged by His Majesty in India, to drive the cars which he took back with him. Both were, at the end of the year, on leave in India. A Mr. Miller, from one of the Cawnpore Mills, has been engaged to superintend the woollen industry at Kabul. Several native doctors and hospital assistants have been engaged during the year. The lady doctor, Mrs. Van Ingen Winter, returned to Kabul in March and about the same time a Miss Bushby, whom the Amir had engaged as companion to his wives, went up there. Miss Bushby was dismissed a few days after she reached Kabul and was not even allowed to visit the harem. Slight disturbances occurred during the year in the Shinwari country, Khost, and among the Jadrans, but the country as a whole was as peaceful as usual. Military. No new units have been raised during the year. No guns have been imported, nor have any been issued from store. It is reported that some workmen, sent from the Kabul arsenal, have converted some of the M L. guns at Herat into B. L, but this is somewhat doubtful. 10,000 new M. L. E. short rifles, manufactured by the Birmingham and the London Small Arms Companies, and ten million rounds of ammunition, supplied by Kynoch, are being imported, and a considerable portion of the con* signment has already reached Kabul. Work on the new cantonments of Jabl-us-Siraj and Kalat-us-Siraj has been continued, but it is improbable that they will prove of any military importance whatever. The routes by which the Amir travelled were improved by forced labour. It is believed that the Amir has ordered the main roads from Kabul to Kandahar, Herat, and Mazar-i- Sharif to be made fit for carts. A considerable number of army transport carts have been ordered from India, and some have already reached Kabul. Of the three bridges mentioned in last year’s Summary only one, that near Darunta, has been taken in hand. The Amir was much impressed by the appearance of the Indian Army, and fully recognised the inferiority of his own troops. On several occasions since his return he has expressed his determination to improve the training o the Afghan army. Little progress, however, appears to have been made as yet, except perhaps at Kabul, where, in addition to the Indian instructors mentioned in last year’s summary, a Turk, said to have been an officer in the Turkish army, has been employed in drilling the infantry. Some more Turks, some of whom are said to be drill instructors, have reached Herat from Meshed, and are on their way to Kabul. NORTH-WEST EBONTIEB-. Kashmir. Mailway project —Mx. Deuchars surveyed the Jhelum , f ° r ^ alignment for the railway on easier curves and gradients than the previous alignment of Mr Thornhill’s, and was able to find one with a ruling gradien of ll^ercent. and a Umiting curvature of 350 feet. This alignment, with atotal length of 109'18 miles from the frontier near Garhi Habibulla to Srinagar, would, he estimated, cost Rs. 1,58,00,000. On the assumption that it would be impossible to find an alignment with such easy curves and gradient, it had been proposed that electric power should be used. But now that an alignment has been discovered upon which steam power could be employed without difficulty it has been decided not to incur the large capital expenditure which electrification would necessitate, but to employ steam power till the traffic on the railway has developed sufficiently to justify the outlay. The Durbar think that they could only afford to construct the railway as far as Baramulla, and not for its whole length into Srinagar. They have made enquiries from financial houses in England with a view to raising the necessary loan, and have ascertained that the sum required can be obtained at a rate, includ ing all charges, of 5 per cent, on the money that would actually reach them. They are considering these financial proposals and are awaiting the orders of the Government of India on the questions of jurisdiction, management and control of construction. Electric power scheme .—The progress on the works connected with this scheme has been good ; the head-works were practically completed by mid summer, and the small balance of work remaining was to be carried out in the winter months of 1907-08 when the river is at its lowest. The Gilgit Agency. The Gil git garrison has been reduced from 12 companies of infantry, one mountain battery, and one company of Sappers, to eight companies of infantry and one battery. Chiteal, The conduct of the Mehtar has been, on the whole, satisfactory throughout the year. In September he was permitted to pay a visit to Simla, where he was received by His Excellency the Viceroy. The services of a forest officer have been lent to the Mehtar. He reports that the forests, though they have been much damaged by neglect, are of con siderable value, and might yield a large revenue if properly worked. A change in the method of conducting the Chitral reliefs was made this year. The supporting battalion now halts at Darora, instead of crossing the Lowarai pass. A somewhat serious mishap befell the relieved column, while crossing the Lowarai on the 21st of October. A blizzard came on and the rear guard found it impossible to cross the pass, and was obliged to retire to Drosh. Nine followers and 43 mules were lost, and many loads had to be abandoned. The Chitrali officials and the Chitrali and Dir villagers gave willing assistance in rescuing men and loads. The rear guard crossed the pass on the 29th, and completed their journey without further incident. Dir, Swat and Bajaur. The year has been one of almost constant internal war in Dir and Bajaur. The main causes of this w r ere two—first, the failure of the Khan of Dir to keep the agreement he made with his brother, Miangul Jan, in 1906 ; second, the feud between the Nawab of Nawagai and his eldest son, Muhammad Ali. The history of these two disputes cannot be kept separate, for the Bajaur factions have constantly intervened in Dir affairs, and vice versa. Badshah Khan commenced the year by seizing Shiringal, and claiming forced labour and revenue from the Dush Khel country. Both these localities were allotted to Miangul Jan by the Chakdara agreement. When warned by the Political Agent that the Chakdara agreement must be maintained, the Khan replied that the agreement held good only as long as Miangul Jan was friendly, whereas he w r as now hostile.125 The Khan then commenced to collect men for an attack on JVIundah. Saiyid Ahmad Khan of Barwa offered to assist him if he were promised pos session of Mundah, when taken. Muhammad Ali also begged for aid from the Khan of Dir against his father, in reply to which the latter, in conjunction with the Khans of Khar and Jandul, sent in a ym/a to Malakand, to request that Badshah Khan should be prohibited from interfering in Bajaur affairs, also that he should be ordered to help the Navvab against his rebellious son, and finally, that if he did attack Jandul, and was beaten, the Bajauris might be allowed to follow up their success. The Political Agent then sent for Badshah Khan. He promised to come in, but, instead of doing so, marched on Jandul, and was twice repulsed by Miangul Jan and the Khan of Khar. About the same time Muhammad Ali made a demonstration against Khar, but was defeated by one of his brothers. The Political Agent now informed the contending parties that Govern ment viewed their proceedings with disapproval. This caused them to disperse their lashkars. The Khan of Dir and his brother, the Nawab and his sons, and all the other Bajaur Khans were then summoned to &amp; jirga at Cbakdara, where after protracted negotiations an agreement was concluded by which the status quo was to be maintained, and a truce kept for six months. Badshah Khan and Miangul Jan were reconciled, and the former restored the villages which he had occupied in contravention of the agreement of 1906. Peace did not last long. In July the Khan of Khar was fighting with the Salarzais, Muhammad Ali was doing all he could to annoy his father, who had appealed to the Mohmands for assistance, and Badshah Khan made an unsuccessful move over the Janbatai pass on Barwa. In August a peace was patched up between the Nawab and Muhammad Ali. Badshah Khan again seized Shiringal. He then reported that all his Khans were planning to rebel against him. He thereupon summoned them to Dir and apparently reconciled them to his rule, for they shortly afterwards sent out parties of men to build a fort at Walai in Miangul Jan’s country. The last-named immediately led a lashkar against them, and they retired. It was now September, and the time for the Chitral reliefs was approach ing. The Political Agent therefore warned all parties against disturbing the peace of the country during the reliefs. No incident occurred during the movement, except that already referred to under Chitral. About this time the Khan of Dir J s favourite wife died, and his mind was said to have become unhinged in consequence. He came under the influence of a Jllullci, who said he would restore the deceased lady to life. The orthodox JSlullas openly called the Khan an infidel for believing in this impostor. His unpopularity was further increased by his disregard of established tribal customs, and by the end of October practically all his subjects were alienated from him. The discontent culminated on the 10th November in a rising of all the southern Khans, assisted by Miangul Jan, who occupied Kunater and Bobat. Only Badshah Khan’s own clan, the Painda Khel, remained faithful to him. The Khan at first sent zjirga to parley with Ins enemies, but while negotia tions were actually in progress he ordered his lashkar to attack Maidan. Hus they did, and were defeated and driven back over the Kalpanai pass. Badshah Khan then sent in a jirga to the Malakand to ask for Government intervention. The Political Agent advised the Khans not to attack Dir ±°r t e present; the lashkars were dismissed and at the end of the year negotiations for a general settlement were in progress. The tribes of the right bank of the Upper Swat, hitherto subject to Dir, have announced their intention of asserting their independence under Govern ment control. They have been told to bring m a thoroughly representative jirga, but have received no sort of encouragement to establish their independence of the Khan of Dir. They have, however, been informed that if they succeeded in making their independence a ‘fait accompli ’ it would be recognise y e British Government. There is nothing to record regarding the Utman Khel, except that a band of them were guilty of a slight interference with a survey pai y. During the latter part of the year work was commenced on the Upper Swat Elver Canal. Ihis canal will take otf from the Swat Eiver about \half-a-mile below Chakdara, and follow an alignment along fairly low land to the range of hills on which the Malakand Eort is situated. Through this range it is proposed to drive a tunnel 5,000 feet in length, precipitating the water down a rocky gorge into the Dargai Nala. On reaching Dargai the main canal will bifurcate into the Machai and Abazai branches. The estimated cos£T?r Ks. 1,82,00,000, and it is thought that the work should be finished in about seven years. This canal, when completed, will irrigate an area of 380,000 acres of culturable land. Black Mountain. There i&amp; nothing to record with the exception that the succession to the Khnnship of Seii, vacant owing to vbe murder of Ibrahim Khan in November 19C6, has not vet been settled. Afridis and Khaibar Tribes. The history of the dealings of Government with the Afridis during the past year consists almost exclusively of their relations with the Zakka Khel. With the exception of this clan the behaviour of the tribe has remained satis factory throughout the year. The Zakka Khel, however, have continued to maintain the attitude of open defiance which they have adopted during recent years. By the end of 1906 the tale of offences committed by this clan had mounted up to such an extent that the Government of India were compelled to consider the advisabil ity of adopting punitive measures against them. The time was, however, considered inopportune in view of the approaching visit to India of the Amir of Afghanistan, and orders were therefore issued that the Zakka Khel jirga should not be called in to receive their allowances and that the clan should, if possible, be ignored till such time as the Amir should have returned to his own country. Continued raiding, however, necessitated a re-cousideration of the matter in February 190/ and early in March the Secretary of State was addressed as to the advisability of employing military action against the clan. By this time the Zakka Khel themselves appear to have been convinced that the patience of Government must at last have been exhausted and that an expedition against them was inevitable, involving in all probability the per manent occupation of their valley by the Sarkar. They devoted much time to holding endless councils among themselves as to the best course to pursue and, perhaps on this account, there was a marked diminution of raiding during the latter part of March and April, and this, combined with the lateness of the season, impelled the Government of India to recommend to the Secretary of State the postponement of any operations against the clan till the autumn. The summer passed quietly with an almost total absence of raids. The tribes men had retired to summer quarters in the hills and felt little inclined to descend into the heat of the plains. At the end of September it was, apparent ly, considered that there was no longer any cause for immediate action against them. The Zakka Khel, however, though at first surprised beyond measure at the inaction of Government, had by this time come to believe that no punish ment would ever be meted out to them, and they resolved to continue in their former course. They opened the winter raiding season by an attack on the village of Sumari, in the heart of the Kohat District, on 3rd October, and from that time to the end of the year scarcely a week passed which was not marked by one or more daring raids in British territory by Zakka Khel. By Decem ber the condition of affairs on the Kohat and Peshawar borders had become well nigh intolerable ; troops were in constant requisition to assist the Border Military Police in their fruitless efforts to capture the perpetrators of these outiages, and all sense of security of life and property was at an end. r n tribesmen themselves there has been more than the usual amount ot hghting during the last year. A continuous feud existed between the Malik- dm Khel, the head of the Samil faction of the Afridis, and the Kambar Khel, an important clan of the Gara faction. The quarrel originated over the possession of the lands in the Kajurai plain, These lands have for127 long l )e en the common property of all sections of the Afridis, excepting the Zakka Khel, but have been chiefly occupied by the Sipah and Kamrai clans during the wmler months During the last five years the Kambar Khel, Mahkdin Khel and Kuki Khel have revived their dormant claims to equal possession of the Ka 3 urai plain and all clans of Afridis have been living doo- e - ther in Kajurai, though many Kambar Khel and Malikdin Khel settled for the winter m the villages of Peshawar. The Samil faction of late determined to oust the Gara. In the summer of: 1906 the Malikdin Khel agreed to abstain rom going to the Peshawar district and decided to go en masse to Kaiurai. they gave their hatred of British authorities to be their reason for doing so and succeeded in throwing dust in the eyes of the Kambar Khel and Kuki Khel! whose families went mainly to British territory and to the Jamrud maira. In this way the Samil clans gained possession of all the points of real importance m the Kajurai plain. Both Malikdin Khel and Kambar Khel left garrisons in their towers on the Kajurai plain during the hot weather. The Kaka Khel Miaus of Nowshera, the other Afridi clans, and even Afghan officials have attempted to mediate, but so far without success. The duplication of the Khaibar road was completed during the year. During the Amir’s visit to India wireless telegraphic communication was established between Bandi Kotal and Peshawar, and proved a great success. On the conclusion of the visit the apparatus was dismantled. Work continued as far as mile 300 (24J miles from Peshawar) on the Loe Shilman railway. Beyond this point the question of the further align ment is still unsettled. Mr. Harrington, late Ciiief Engineer of the Kalka- Simla Railway, was deputed by Government to furnish his recommendations. He favoured a line up the Loe Shilman valley, breaking through the ridge north of the Shilman Ghakbai pass by a tunnel. As his report was considered incon clusive and unsatisfactory His Excellency the Viceroy ordered that a fresh investigation of the engineering aspect of the question should be undertaken. Accordingly Mr. Johns, accompanied by an escort of the Khaibar Rifles, was then sent to examine the several alignments. He was prevented from visiting a portion of the Kabul River valley by a party of Mohniands, who fired on him from the left bank of the river, but he was enabled to see what in his opinion was sufficient for his purpose. His report is under consideration. In the spring there was considerable excitement in the Adam Khel country owing to rumours, which were universally believed, that Government was poisoning the wells in order to spread plague. It was reported that the Government agents for the purpose were the Kaka Khel Mians. In conse quence this clan, who travel as a rule all over Asia in perfect safety, were unable to cross the border. The rumours gradually died down and were finally discredited when the leading men of the Kaka Khel testified by oath to the groundlessness of the report at the Kaka Sahib’s Ziarat near Nowshera. The attitude of Khan Bahadur Malik Yar Muhammad Khan, head of the Malikdin Khel clan, and hitherto a loyal supporter of Government, has not been altogether satisfactory. His intention was apparently to become recognised by the authorities as an intermediary between the Political Agent, Khaibar, and the Zakka Khel. With this object he encouraged the turbulent sections of the latter in their intrigues with the Afghan officials. Kurram Valley. In the Kurram valley there is little to record. Thanks to their unfortu nate position surrounded by lawless tribes, the Turis were as usual subjected to a series of raids by the Khani Khel section of the Chamkannis, the Jajis and the Khostwals. In the spring strong bands from Khost, presumably with the connivance of the local Afghan officials, invaded the valley, and the telegraph line was repeatedly cut. On one occasion the Turis made a successful counter raid on the Jajis. Measures were, however, taken to prevent a repetition of this course. In June the Turis and Jajis patched up a truce between them selves with a promised duration of two years.Communications. —On the 2nd -February a Committee was assembled at Thai to consider “ The question of the ingress and egress of the Kurram A aUey llailway at Thai, and the defensive measures connected therewith. the Committee recommended : i. The demolition of the present railway station. ii That blockhouses be constructed for the defence of the proposed bridges, which could not be adequately protected from the fort. Hi That the new station buildings should be made defensible and independent of the fort in case of attack, accommodation in them being provided for 25 men in addition to the Station Staff. iv. That blockhouses be errected on the hills which command the station, their number and exact sites being fixed subsequently by the local authorities. v. That entries should be made in the record plans of the new station yard showing the military sidings that may be necessary in future on the flat ground near the Sangroba Nala. vi. That the above-mentioned blockhouses, etc., he occupied on peace time by Border Military Police or Militia. vii. That the present fort be maintained for the accommodation of the authorised garrison of Regular Troops. A few days later, under the express orders of the Secretary of State, all work was suspended on the Kohat-Thal railway conversion and the extension up the Kurram Valley. Work was continued on the railway and road-bridge at Khushalgarh, and on conversion of the narrow-gauge line from Khushalgarh to Kohat to broad-gauge. Both works were completed before the end of the year, though not actually opened to traffic. At the beginning of the year it was noticed that some of the roads of primary strategic importance in the Kohat-Kurram area were in a bad state of repair. These roads were :— (i) The Hangu-Pat Darband road; (ii) The Kohat-Thal road ; (Hi) The Thal-Prachinar road. With regard to (ii) it had apparently been forgotten that whereas in peace time the narrow-gauge line from Kohat to Thai carries all local traffic and the road is so little used that a wheeled vehicle is rarely seen on it, in time of war, until the broad-gauge line reaches Thai, the situation will be reversed. The narrow-gauge line will carry little, and the road will be crowded. With regard to (Hi), serious work had been suspended on this road for the last year or two, as the intention had been to build a railway up the valley. The veto of the Secretary of State on this project again brought the importance of good communications by road to the fore. As the result of representations steps were taken in April to place all three roads in a better state of repair, and estimates for metalling (i) and (in) were prepared in the hope that money would be forthcoming in the future. Estimates were also prepared for the construction of a metalled cart road from Parachinar to the Paiwar Kotal, hut nothing further has been done in the matter of this most important communication. Waziuistan. The state of affairs in Waziristan during the past year has been far from satisfactory. The number of raids and outrages committed in British territory has far exceeded the normal, and the relations of Government with the Mahsud tribe have on more than one occasion almost reached breaking point.129 Tho Darwesh Kb el have given but little trouble. In fact a petition was received from them asking Government to construct roads through their country and to establish posts at various places in the Khaisora, Shaktu and Razmak passes, on the Shawal, and at Sarkai Ragbza, Bazai Tanda China, Maidan, Saparzai, Badar and Shakai, and thus save the tribe from the depreda tions which are constantly committed on them by the Mabsuds. The origin of all the trouble with the Mahsuds can be traced to the Mulla Powinda, so long a predominant and disturbing factor in Mahsud affairs and now the main obstacle to the establishment of peace. The offer of a jagir to him at the end of 1906 did not have the desired effect, and has only served to embitter his relations with the British Govern ment. The land was never taken up by the ^'ulla, who happened to be in Kabul at the time that the award was made known. The announcement weakened considerably his influence with the tribe, while a redistribution of the Government allowances on the system strengthened the hands of the leading maliks. To counterbalance their influence and to discredit them in the eyes of Government, the Mulla endeavoured to establish his own religious supremacy by engineering a series of fanatical outrages. Many of these do not' appear to have got beyond the talked-of stage, but there is some reason to suppose that a few outrages were seriously contemplated. That such attempts were not more successful was entirely due to precautions taken and to the timely warning received. In the meantime evidence had been accumulating, and it was proved beyond doubt that the Mulla Powinda had connived at the murder of Captain Bowring, Colonel Harman and Captain Donaldson, and also had been concerned in many other offences. On the 3rd August it was found necessary to issue a warning to the whole Mahsud tribe that if fanatics were sent out to work mischief in British territory, the whole tribe would be held responsible and serious consequences would ensue. This warning met with definite and prompt defiance. This result may in some measure have been assisted by the sudden appearance in Mahsud territory of one Lala Pir, a mulla of Maimandi in Khost. Armed with a document purporting to confer authority to undertake special work on behalf of the Afghan Government, this mulla had for some months been spreading anti- British propaganda among the various tribes on the Kurram and Wazinstan borders. A raid took place on the 4th September by 320 Mahsuds on Narmi Khel, Bakka Khel cattle within the Bannu border. The raiding party included representatives of all the leading sections of the Mahsud tribe, but it is not clear that this raid possessed any definite political significance. An insolent letter was also sent by the Mulla to the political agent at Wana, and numerous alleged assassins were said to have been despatched to British lim ^ a * , these were arrested and one openly confessed that be bad been despatched by the Mulla to murder the Political Agent at Wana. In order to keep alire the belief of the Mahsuds in the promise of possible assistance from Kabul, the Mulla Powinda gave out that he had receded orders from the Hakim of Urgun to prepare a camping g r0 “'5 ^ mrohi which he Afghans, and employed certain Mahsuds m building a fort at Marobi, which h assured the people would he held by an Afghan garrison. The situation became so intolerable and the duplicity of the so evident, that in October Government decided to withdraw the of the grant of land that had been to the MuUa and^ to d^ ^ _ his allowances; to ignore him in all future , ° ^ desire for and to withhold all the Mahsud allowances until he ii friendly relations. These orders were announced to the November, at a time when the Mulla was again abs , nresent at Kabul From accounts received the Mulla secured a small mon y p but no encouragement of any kind.In May the Mahsuds acknowledged their responsibility for the good behayiour of their kinsmen in the Northern Waziristan Militia. Application was made to re-enlist Mahsuds in the South Waziristan Militia, but permission was not accorded on the grounds that it was imprudent to increase the local element during the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. The trade in arms from across the Afghan border seems to have been un usually brisk during the year. About 7,000 rifles, mainly Martinis and Lee- Metfords, arrived in Kattawaz and were sold for Rs. 60 and upwards. Attention was drawn in the beginning of the year to the military danger caused by the want of a bridge at the crossing over the Tochi at Boya. Here, even in early spring before the snow water comes down, there are some 2J to 3 feet of water; later, in March and thoughout April it is at times impossible to cross. In April the General Officer Commanding, Bannu Brigade, when on inspection duty in the Tochi, found it impossible to cross the river at Boya, and was unable to visit the upper posts. It has been proposed to build here either a masonry bridge, which it is estimated would cost about Rs. 80,000, or a light suspension bridge at an estimated cost of about Rs. 10,000 ; the latter would be unable to take wheeled traffic unless man-handled and would be of small utility. However, the project still remains in the paper stage, and the Boya crossing remains a dangerous potential block in the communications of the Tochi Valley. Work was continued on the new bridge over the Gumal river near Murtaza; owing to the fact that work had to be suspended during the flood season progress was slow, and the bridge was still incomplete at the end of the year. The new cart road to Wana was much damaged by floods in the spring at the point where it has been aligned through the Dozakh Tangi, but was repaired before the middle of July. BALUCHISTAN. Southern Baluchistan. In March-April the Political Agent in Kalat made a tour in Jhalawan country. The main objects of the tour, which were successfully attained, were:— {a) The carrying out of certain measures for the better administration of the Mengal tribes, viz., the removal of Mir Wali Muhammad from his office as Vakil; the reinstatement of Sardar Shakar Khan as chief of the Mengals; the appointment of Sardar Shakar Kban*s son, Mir Alladina, as Thanadar of the new thana at Wadh ; the distribution of the thana service among the motabirs of the tribe; and the removal from Jhalawan of the heads of the rival faction, Mir Wali Muhammad and his son Mir Rahim Khan ; (b) the enforcement of the award of the Sibi Jirga in the case of the dispute between the Mengals and Jamots, in accordance with which blood money had to be recovered from the Mengals for their share in the disturbances on the Jhalawan-Las Bela border. For some time past unsatisfactory relations had existed between Wali Muhammad Mengal and the Jam of Las Bela. With a view to settling these the Political Agent succeeded in arranging that a matrimonial alliance should be contracted between the Jam and Wali Muhammad’s eldest daughter. After the settlement in December 1906 by the Political Agent of the dispute between the Marris and Bugtis over the possession of the Phailawagh grazing grounds, the principal ringleaders in the opposition to the settlement were surrendered at the beginning of 1907. These were dealt with by Jirga and sentenced to various terms of imprisonmenti Nawab Khair Bakhsh, the Marri chief, and his advisers were dealt with leniently by the Jirga. The chief, instead of being grateful, was foolish enough to think that the case would be once more reopened and adopted a recalcitrant attitude. He twice refused to come in when summoned by the Political Agent, Sibi, and also ignored a similar summons from the Agent to the Governor-General himself. He alsofailed to produce the security of Es. 12,000 for the good conduct of his tribe which under the Jirga award he was called upon to furnish. At the request of the Marri headmen, Sir H. McMahon decided to give the Nawab one more chance, and the headmen promised either to bring in the Nawab or failing him to bring in his eldest son whom they would be prepared to elect as their Chief with a Council of Regency to be appointed by the Agent to the Governor- General. This bad the desired effect, and the Chief came in accompanied by his headmen.^ At his interview with the Agent to the Governor-General at Quetta, the Nawab humbly apologised for his recent behaviour. Personal securi ties were taken for both the Marri and Bugti chiefs in the sum of Rs. 12,000 each for the maintenance of peace on their borders for a term of 3 years, and the Marri chief bound himself to be responsible for the good behaviour of the Jantalli Loharanis, who took a prominent part in the demonstration against demarcation. In addition the Loharani section were fined Rs. 10,000. Owing to the uncertainty which exists as to the exact limits of the jurisdic tion of Sir Nauroz Khan, K.C.I.E., the Kharan Sardar, it was decided to place an ofiBcer on special duty for a period of about 6 months to inquire into all affairs connected with Kharan. A telegraph line was completed from Panjgur to Nok-Kondi on the Nushki' Robat line and carried on to Robat, so that on the 5th November through communication was established between Karachi and Teheran by land on one wire. The question of the extension of the Quetta-Nushki Railway from its present terminus at Nushki to Ahmadwal was again discussed during the year. This extension was originally proposed in 1904 on the ground of the unsuitability, chiefly on account of its inferior water-supply, of Nushki either for a railway terminus or for the Civil Head-Quarters of the Chagai Agency. Military and financial considerations were, however, adduced against the proposal, and it was finally decided that, at any rate for the present, the rail head shall remain at Nushki. In the meantime endeavours are to be made to improve the latter place by introducing a piped water-supply. The following table shows the value of the import and export trade carried over the Nushki-Sistan Trade Route during nine months of 1907, compared with the corresponding months of 1906 (no figures for January, February and March are available):— April ...

In January the Khoidad Khel, a section of the Suleman Khel Ghilzaw, commenced to give trouble in British territory. It appeared that the widow of a late Khoidad Khel chief had eloped with her son-in-law into Zhob. As the culprits would certainly be punished with death if handed hack to their tribe, the British authorities declined to give them up. In consequence the Khoidad Khel did considerable damage to the telegraph line between Gul Kach and Husain Kika, and threatened to do further mischief unless thematter were settled. The posts and patrols along the border were accordingly strengthened. On the 9th February the Political Agent, Zhob, met the Khoidad Khel in jirga on the frontier, with the result that a satisfactory settle ment was eventually arrived at. A sum of Us. 500 was paid as compensation to Gulai, Khoidad Khel, (to whom the absconding widow had been promised in marriage), out of which its. 100 were deducted on account of the damage done to the telegraph line. Shirani outlaws were responsible for several raids during the year. On 22nd April seven travellers were killed near Dhana Sar in the Chua Khel Dhana. On 10th May an attack was made on Koria Wasta, north of Man! Khwa, in which two men were killed and one carried off. There were also several outrages of a minor character. It was decided to make the Shirani tribe responsible for any future occurrences of a similar nature in their country ; the Shirani jirga acknowledged their responsibility, and a fine was imposed for the second of the two outrages mentioned above, In the case of the first it has been decided to realise from the Khidarzais such a sum, on account of blood- money and loss of property, as the local political authorities may consider to be sufficiently deterrent without exasperating them into leaving the country, as it was feared they would do if too heavy a fine were imposed In the case of the murder of Nawab Bangal Khan, head of the Jogezai tribe in Zhob, referred to in the Annual Summary for 1906, the facts of the case as proved by the jirga are briefly as follows:— Khan Sahib Abdul Rahman Khan, Extra Assistant Commissioner of Hinduhagh, on arrival at Killa Saifulla was visited on the 1st May 1906 by the leading members of the Jogezai, the ruling family of the Kakar tribe. The family consists of many branches, the principal of whom are the Ishak Kahols and Nawab Kahols. The Ishak Kahols, comprising Nawab Bangal Khan, his son Zarif Khan, his step brothers Oma Khan and Sher Khan, and son-in-law Luni Khan, were the first to arrive, and sat down in the verandah of the rest-house with the Extra Assistant Commissioner. Soon after them arrived the Nawab Kahols, i.e.&gt; Sardar Bahadur Muhammad Akbar Khan, the acting Sardar of the Kakar tribe, his cousin Baran Khan and others, and they sat down with the rest. In the conversation which followed Sardar Muhammad Akbar Khan appears to have said something to cause offence to the Ishak Kahols, and Zarif Khan suddenly whipped out his revolver and fired three shots at Sardar Muhammad Akbar Khan, wounding him twice in the left hand and once in the back of the left shoulder. Muhammad Akbar Khan went, or was dragged by the Extra Assistant Commissioner, into the rest-house, while Zarif Khan went outside the verandah followed by his father Nawab Bangal Khan, who remonstrated with him and tried to get him to give up his pistol. While he was doing this Baran, who had possessed himself of Sardar Muhammad Akbar Khan’s revolver, came up close behind him and fired three shots into him at such a close distance that his clothing was set on fire. It is not khown whether Muhammad Akbar Khan gave Baran the revolver to shoot Bangal Khan with, or whether the latter snatched it out of his belt. Baran in turn was attacked by Luni with a sword and by Oma Khan with a pistol. He managed to make his escape and take refuge in an adjacent house, receiving one sword and two bullet wounds. ThQ jirga awarded Rs. 5,000 and other compensation to the Ishak Kahols as blood money for the murder of Nawab Bangal Khan, and Rs. 2,500 to the Nawab Kahols as compensation for Sardar Muhammad Akbar Khan’s wounds. They recommended that as Sardar Muhammad Akbar Khan had been instrumen tal by his conduct to the Ishak Kahols, in the shaping of the events which led to Nawab Bangal Khan’s murder, and as he could not with safety return to Zhob, he should not be allowed to return. Hostages and securities were taken from both factions to ensure peace. Zarif Khan, Baran, Oma Khan and Luni were kept in custody pending final orders in the case.133 The highly strained relations between the Ishak Kahols and Nawab Kahols, and the yery heated feeling of the whole country on account of the death of Nawab Bangal Khan, the most beloved and respected Chief in Zhob, rendered it impossible to expect that any amicable or mutual settlement of family and tribal differences could be arrived at, and it seemed desirable to delay any attempt to settle the case until there appeared to be a chance of doing so with reasonable hope of finality. In June Oma Khan was reported to be suffering from the effects of confinement, and the release of both him and Luni was at once ordered. Oma Khan died immediately after his return to his home. His death further com plicated the case as the blame of it was thrown by the Ishak Kahols on the Nawab Kahols. It appeared inadvisable to delay settlement any longer, and for the purpose of adjudicating upon the recent developments of the case, and of deciding to what extent the deaths of Nawab Bangal Khan and Oma Khan affected the previous distribution of the allowances enjoyed by the Jogezai family, another influential was summoned. The jirga decided that it was no longer possible for the Ishak Kahols and Nawab Kahols as a whole to reside together in Zhob; that certain leading members of the Nawab Kahols, including Sardar Muhammad Akbar Khan, must live elsewhere. They also laid down that Sardar Muhammad Akbar Khan could no longer remain the Sardar of the Kakar tribe; that the Sardarship must return to the Ishak Kahol, the elder and rightful branch of the Jogezai family, and that of the two members of that family who have a right to succeed, i.e., Zarghun Khan and Zarif Khan, the latter alone had sufficient tribal support and backing to enable him to rule the tribe. The Government of India confirmed the decision of the jirga. G. a B. P., Simla.— No. S-1681. B.-16.6-08.4Q. N.
