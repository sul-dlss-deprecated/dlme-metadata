It is good of the Air Ministry to agree with my views and 1 hope they did not think that I was unduly sticky over the matter, but as there was a question of principle involved I thought it incumbent on me to adhere to my opinion. In practice it will, of course, make no difference to the Air Officer Commanding as whenever permission is applied for I shall give it.

We have no wish to press the procedure which we proposed in face of the objections expressed by the Political Resident. It seemed to us that it was unnecessary to involve the political authorities so long as the powers of the air authorities to ’’pay in kind” was restricted to recognition of specific services. As, however, the Resident is of a different opinion and considers that there is a distinct difference between ’’cash payments” and ’’payments in kind” in the eyes of local notabilities, that settles the matter. We are accordingly sending out revised instructions to the A.O.C. ’Iraq to make it clear that all cases of proposed remuneration in kind must be referred to the political authorities in advance for their approval. We will send similar instructions to the O.C. Aden and the A.O.G. Palestine &amp; Transjordan, as it is preferable P.T.O. J.G.

The principle involved remains the same and there is a distinct difference between a cash payment for labour or material and a ’’payment in kind” which, at all events in t he eyes of the M local notability” in question ^generally a Shaikh;, would be indistinguishable from a ’’present”. 1 am afraid therefore that i am definitely of opinion that before any H payment in kind” is given my sanction should be obta ined. 3, 1 should, like again to draw attention to the fact that it was only on condition that the Kesident’s sanction should be obtained that Biscoe, when the question was first mooted, agreed to gifts being given at all. i am sending a copy of thi s letter to Metcalfe.

Ify dear Laithwaite, Your letter of January 23rd (P.Z.437/34) about the relations between the B.A.F. abroad and local ncr&amp;^pilities in respect of services rendered by the latter. It seems to me that both you ana the.Resident ^ S’ attaching to our proposal rather more than we intend. £ # / ^ I/agree that when this proposal was first launched we had vT^r in mind the possibility of gifts to local notabilities, not ^ h , necessarily on account of specific services rendered, but O r- as general sweeteners of our relations v/ith them. When this was put to the Political Departments, namely yourselves; the Foreign Office ana the Colonial Office, it became clear that the proposal was regarded by all of them as one tending to impinge upon the responsibilities of the political authorities m the areas concerned. In these circumstances it seemed best considerably to restrict its scope. The instructions, as now sent out, (I enclose a P.T.O. J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. [ R£Cr. rx rV: 'copy of a letter to the A.O.C. ’Iraq) merely enable the A.O.C. to make a payment in kind instead of m cash when that form of payment.is more convenient in return for some specific service rendered by a local notability in the form of labour or material or accommodation. There is to be no question of the A.O.C. using this power for giving ’’presents” of any kind, • and that being so it did not seem to us that the need for prior consultation with the Resident would arise if the remuneration was expressed in kind any more than it would arise if it was an ordinary cas)a payment for labour or material. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel of the Foreign Office and Williams of the Colonial Office. Yours/ 1 m © \ C_OPY. 17255/^0/S*6. 14th December, 1953.

(See Mr. Cohen’s demi-official letter of July 28th, 1931 : 102/9). Typical cases which the Council have in mind are when assistance is rendered m the case of a crash or forced landing : when protection is given to a temporary store of fuel : or other similar definite service is rendered in the form of labour or material or accommodation It has been represented that a more convenient and appropriate method of remuneration in such cases may some times be m the form of stores (e.g. tentage) rather than by a money payment out up to the present, issues from stores in payment for services so rendered have not been authorised by regulations. The Council have now decided to amend the present procedure and such services may m future be recompensed by issues from stores provided that the total value of stores so issued in your Command does not exceed £150 m any one year or a value of £20 in any one case. It should be clearly understood that the exercise of these powers is to be confined to the recompensing of specific services to the Royal Air Force m your Command. It is not the intention of the Air Council that they should be used for making presentations of honour or for charitable purposes. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Air Officer Commanding, (Sgd.)

Copies of this letter were sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and I now enclose copy of a letter received from Fowls, which is self-explanatory. We had not raised the point with you penning the receipt of his views, but we agree entirely with what he says ana hope that you will see no aifficulty in agreeing that no presents, whether in cash or in kind, should be given to the notabilities by the R.A.P. authorities, save after/ . iiiVaxiS, ilioQ *, Air ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway,after prior consultation with ana. with the sanction of the Political Resident, is Fowls points out, it was only on the explicit condition that the Resident’s sanction woula te obtained that Sir Hugh Biscoe, when the matter first came up, agreea to gifts being ei ven 3 .

Please refer to your Printed Letter No. P.Z.8087/33 with enclosures on the subject of the relations between the E.A.F. in *Ira(i and local notabilities in respect of services rendered by the latter* I understand from the enclosures that the E.A.F. authorities can remunerate the local notabilities in kind but not in cash. The principle, however, vis-a-vis the local political authorities seems to me to be the same; since the la tier also from time to time give presents in kind. As far as the Persian Gulf is concerned, therefore, before any presents in kind are given by the E.A.F. I am of opinion that my sanction should be obtained ( I am not quite clear whether this is contemplated). You will remember it was on the condition that the Eesident f s sanction should be obtained that my predecessor, Biscoe, agreed to gifts being given all.

There is, no doubt, a good deal to be said for keeping distributions of this nature entirely in the hands of the political authorities, but on the whole, having regard to the limitations placed on any action by the A.O.C.

I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to the gifts of tentage and of rifles, noted on pp.8 and 13 of the Air Services Appropriation Account, 1929, and to acquaint you for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury that the circumstances are as follows. 2. The tentage was presented by the Air Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, Iraq, to Khan Bahadur Issa Abdul Latif, an influential Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast, for the double purpose of enhancing his prestige v/ith the Trucial Sheikhs, from whom facilities for visits of flying boats have to be sought, and of providing accommodation for the crews of visiting flying boats. The Air Council are of opinion that the circumstances justified the action taken by the Air Qiicer Commanding, subject to appropriate financial approval being obtained. 3 . The rifles were never presented at all. In point of fact it was intended to make a gift of one rifle, but the intention was not carried into effect, and the rifle is still in possession of the Royal Air Force. 4. i am accordingly to request that you will move Their Lordships to give covering sanction to the gift of tentage to the value of £70.10.10., and to enquire at the same time whether Their Lordships would be prepared to agree that in future cases of this kind, but within a monetary limit ox £20 The Secretary, Treasury, S.W.l. in LV • • ^ in any case and of £260 in all in any financial year, the Air or other Officers Commanding, Iraq, Aden and Singapore should have power to make gifts to individuals when such gifts are considered likely to result in more than equivalent (political) advantages to British interests. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) S. LAtfNBliUTHEH.COPY. \) 7 j. . % r ^ • 1301 ; 3 3 2 THEASUKT CHAMBERS, 13th November, 1931 S.36799. Sir, I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty*8 Treasury Sir S. Lannreuther’s letter (17255/30/P.L.) of the 30th October, 1931, with reference to certain gifts of tentage and oi rilles noted on pages 8 and 13 of the Air Service Appropriation Account 1929. The tentage was presented by the Air Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, Iraq, to Khan Bahadur Issa Abdul Latif an influential Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast. The rifles were, in fact, never presented at all. In reply I am directed to request you to inform the Air Council that My Lords, in the circumstances represented, give covering sanction to the gift ox tentage to the value of £70. 10. 10. They regret, however, that They are unable to agree that Officers Oonm.ancling Iiaq, Aden or Singapore should have delegated authority to make gifts of this kind. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sgd,) R.V. NINL HOPKINS. The Secretary, Air Ministry.c S&lt;f) GuPY. S.56799. ThMSUHY CflAiviBEjiS, 11th November, 1931. Lear Lannreuther, We are replying officially to your letter (17255/30/ F.L.} of the 30th October, 1931, giving covering sanction for the gift of tentage made by the Air Officer Commanding to a Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast. As the financial aspect of this matter is unimportant, we are not asking questions as to the circumstances in which this gift was made. You asked us, however, to agree to a general authority. This, we feel unable to do for reasons which I think are better inoicated in a semi-official letter than in our official reply. We recognise, of course, that in oriental countries there are occasions on which a ceremonial exchange of small presents may be necessary, but the circumstances and the nature of such gifts are essentially political questions, and it seems to us that if your Air Officers are given a standing authority, misunderstanding may easily arise between them and the local political authorities. So far as we are aware, the other Service Departments have not found it necessary to have powers of this kind and we should prefer not to give you delegated authority. If, at any time, a question arises of a small ceremonial gift to be given with the concurrence and support of the Sir S. Dannreuther, C.B., Air ministry.I— r - the political authorities, we should of course be prepared to deal with an application for sanction ad hoc - by telephone if necessary or as in the present instance to give covering authority in the exceptional and minor cases. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) R.A. GhlRVij,COPY. AIR MINISTRY, ADAITRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY, .C.2. 22nd January, 1932. Dear Grieve, ^hen you wrote to us officially on 13th November (your S.36799), you sent me a semi-official letter (dated 11th November) explaining your reasons for not allowing to our A.0*8 C. abroad any latitude whatever in the making of gifts of stores to individuals, such as local Sheiks, even when such gifts are considered likely to result in more than equivalent (political) advantages to British interests. It is a small matter and on receiot of your letter I was disposed to let it rest: but now that it has come to the question of communicating or rather re-affirming the decision to the a.O.C. Iraq, I feel some qualms in adopting your uncompromisingly negative attitude. Should there not be some measure of aiscrimination, however small, in the case of gifts of stores made for definite oolitical or service ourposes, the discretion (subject to some limit to be set by you) being restricted to Overseas Commands? On the agreed assumption that the amounts involved are small, the objections to such a proposal can only be political, rather than financial; and it seems to me tnerefore that your point would be met if - in agreeing, if you can, to some such restricted delegation of authority to make minor gifts in return for some public advantage of a desirable kind - you ?;cre to lay down that sucl gifts should only be made on the personal authority and R.A. Grieve, Esq., O.B.E. , Treasury Chambers, S.W.l. certificate J —v J ’?*v mmmm M / certificate of the A.O.C. with the antecedent concurrence of the Governor, High Commissioner, or other principal British Political Representative. The monetary limit suggested in our official letter of 30th October, 1931, was £20 in any particular case and £250 in all in any financial year. Other cases would be referred here, and could, of course, be referred to you, by telephone, if necessary, without any difficulty. But in minor cases (which might be urgent - and on the basis of ’Bis dat qui cito dat’) the delegation of authority would obviate any loss of time in referring home and save both time and effort on the oart of the Air Ministry and the Treasury. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) S. DANNREUTHER.COPY, 8#36799 TREASURY CHAMBERS, S.W.l. 28th January, 1932. Dear D^nnreuther, You wrote to me on the 22nd inetant referring again to the question of allowing your A.O.C.’s abroad the oower to make gifts of stores to certain individuals such as local Sheiks, when such gifts are considered likely to result in more than equivalent (political) advantages to British interests. I am still not happy about granting a general authority which you yourself indicated would be used for political and not military purposes, and would rather not withdraw our official letter. But in view of your feeling as to the difficulty of conveying the decision I would agree that if an Air Officer Commanding with tne antecedent concurrence of His Majesty’s political representative in the country concerned personally authorises a gift of stores within the limits suggested in your official letter of October 31st, 1931, we will give covering sanction on the facts being reported. I hope this will meet your difficulty. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) R. GRIEVE.COPY p Colonial Office, S.W.l. 25th February, 1932. Dear Holloway, This is to confirm my telephone conversation this morning about A.O.C. in Iraq, Aden and Singapore making gifts of a political character (A.M. reference 17255/30/F.D. of 30 Oct. 1931 and subsequent corres pondence) . We should be glad if you would let us have copies of any instructions sent on the subject to the A.0 S .C. ^f already issued: if not issued, may we please see them in draft ? This, you see, is a political matter and it may not be so straightforward as it sees - Singapore, in particular, may give rise to difficulty. And have you consulted India Office as to the Trucial Coast? They are responsible in that area. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) A.C.C, Parkinson. B .E ♦ Holloway Esq., C.B., AIR MINISTRY •COPY ♦ 17255/30. AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, KING SWAY, W.C.2. 26th Eehruary, 1932. — 1 Dear Parkinson, I hear from Holloway that you are rather exercised ahout the political reactions to the proposal (to which the Treasury have lately agreed) that Air Officers Commanding abroad should have authority to make small gifts of stores etc. to local notabilities; and in particular, that you were uneasy about such pov/ers being exercised from Air Headquarters at Singapore. To this latter point I can say that we had already decided that there was no need for these powers to be exercised at all by the Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force at Singapore and had substituted Air Officer Commanding, Palestine and Transjordan in his place. The three Air Officers Commanding who would have these powers will thus be;- Air Officer Commanding Iraq (up to £150 a year); Officer Commanding, Aden (up to £50 a year), and Air Officer Commanding,Palestine and Transjordan (up to £50 a year). We have throughout realised that powers of this kind should be exercised in close collaboration with the appropriate political authority and it is to be an express condition (as was stated in Dannreuther 1 s letter to Grieve of January 22nd) that any gifts under these powers should only be made with the antecedent concurrence of the Governor, High Commissioner or other principal British politica.1 representative. Does not this fully meet any apprehension which the Colonial Office may otherwise feel? Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) C.G. Evans. A.C.C. Parkinson, Esq., C.M.G., Colonial Office, r n WHITEHALL,* S.W.l.owning otreet, 1 yj i arc* t 1932. Thank you for your letter 1*0. 17255/30 ox the 36th February about the proposal to delegate conditional authority to certain Mr Officer® Commanding abroad to make small gifts to local notabilities. fe note that it is no longer proposed that such powers should be exercised from Air Headquarters at Jingapore. We have thought it advisable to write to the High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordan, the High Commissioner for Iraq, and the Resident at Aden, in order to find out whether they have any objection to the proposal, and if not whether there are any other conditions which they think should be made in connection with such gifts. ;&lt;ven though safeguarded by thd conditions referred to in your letter, the proposed arrangement introduces a new departure in Colonial administration, and we naturally hesitate to adopt it without full consideration and consultation . C.O. iiVAiii,La m i &lt; / consultation with the Hi£;h Commissi oners and the R^Vdent at Aden who are concerned. I enclose a copy of a letter on the subject which I am sending to v/alton of the India Office. 1/ ij /'—* y^ \ , c c.
