EAST INDIES; THIS BOOK IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED BY THEIR MUCH OBLIGED, AND ' VERY OBEDIENT SERVANT, NOV. 1799. JOHN JACKSON,preface. Though much has been already written refpeding the communication be tween Great Britain and her Indian pollefsions, yet, as thofe poflefsions have within a few years been much extended, the fubje£t of courfe becomes additionally interefting; and any work that may, even in a fmall degree, tend to facilitate that communication, will, no doubt, be ac ceptable to thofe who are in any way con cerned, in trade, or by other connections, with the East. When the Author undertook this jour ney, he had not the mod dirtant idea that his remarks would ever be requiied to ap pear before the public; for, had he enter- ^ 3 tainedvi preface, tained fuch a prcfumption, he might hater written more iully, and would certainly have been more particular in his inquiries. What he did write was always on the Ipot, from day to day, and was chiefly confined to circumltances which fell under his own obfervation. Many perfons may be apt to inquire,, what motives could have induced a man to undertake fuch an uncommon route, with the certain profpe6l before him of many fatigues and dangers, particularly when, without even a lhadow ot pecuni ary advantage, he muft necelfarily incur a confiderable expenee. In truth, curiofity was the prime mover to this enterprize. The Author went to India by fea, and having occalion to re turn to England, wiflied to vary the fcene, inftcad of coming back by way oi the Cape of Good Hope. Having been accuftomed to an active life, therefore, having always lived tem perately.preface. perately, and enjoying a good fiate of health, he was induced, when at Bom bay , to embrace an opportunity which then offered of returning by fhipping as far as Bussora , though at a feafon when the paiiage had perhaps never before been attempted, being generally thought im- praaicable; trufting to Providence and his own exertions, and poffefsing that cntei- prifing fpirit which enables men to fur- mount difficulties and dangers that to more timid minds appear infuperable. Various journalifts have written on the different routes over-land (as it is vulgarly called) from India , each very naturally recommending the route adopted by him- fclf; thus, fome, defcribe that by way of Suez and Cairo ; fomc again, that over the Great Dcfert to Aleppo ; others have recommended to pafs up the Euphrates as far as Hilla , then to Bagdad , and after that through Assyria, Armenia, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but all have been unanimous in declaring, that this latter route was per- A 4 fccllypreface. fcclly impra6licable in the months from April to September. I he following flieets will ferve to prove, that it is pradicable at all feafons. If the tiaveller pafs through Arabia in winter, when it is temperate, he will line! it ex- cefsively cold among the high mountains in Armenia . If he fuffer a little from the exceisive heat of the fummer in Ara bia , which may be juftly faid to be the hottefl place in the world, he will find the reft ol his journey temperate and pleafant, which may be faid to be, in fome meafure, a recompence. When the Authoi was in Arabia , at midfummer, the fruits were in full feafon, and they continued in that Hate all the way he came to \ ienna ; and fruits are in thofe climes a very great luxury. As few Europeans can readily accuftom themfelves to the Turki/h manner of living, or of accommodation, the Author could not recommend a better route to 13 agdad than the one by which he came, 3 particularly \preface. ix particularly if the traveller be incum bered with much baggage. It' he ihould be entrufted with difpatehes, and celerity be defirable, the Author would advife him. to leave Buss or a on horfeback, and come up the Great Defcrt in a ftraight line to Hilla , accompanied by an Arab Sheik, or a Chookadar*, and only two atten dants. In this cafe, he Ihould be pro vided with a very light tent to fleep under, a quilt to throw over him, and a fmall quantity of coffee, bifcuit, &amp;:c. By this mode of travelling, he may cafily reach Bagdad in fix days; it requires great ex ertions, however; and few men are able at firft to bear it, particularly if their con- ftitutions have been enervated by the luxuries of the East. To any one who may adopt the route defcribed in this work, the following HINTS OF INSTRUCTION may not be unacceptable. * An officer in the army, of a rank about equal to that of a ferjeant. Atx preface. At Bussora , he fliould equip himfclt in all refpedls like the Arabs. It will be neeeffary for him, as foon as he embarks, or even before, to fufter his beard to grow; but, as it may be uncomiortable to wear his beard at full length, it will be futfi- cient if he do but preferve his muftaches. This, however, mull be particularly at tended to, and can by no means be dif- penfed with ; for, though a man without a beard might be fafe in a large city, or in any civilized place, yet in a journey oi this nature, wherein he will often meet with barbarous wandering tribes, who would not hefitate a moment about putting him to death if they Ihould difcover that he was a Fringui*, he will perceive the nccefsity of imitating the Arabs in drefs as nearly as pofsible. As few Europeans have any knowledge of the Arabic language, particularly as it is fpoken in Arabia , he will be much at * A term applied to Chriftians in general. The Arabs call E urope Fringuiftan. a lofs.preface. xi a lofs, efpecially when he has none but Arabs about him. He will, therefore, find it ufeful to have with him a kind of vocabulary, to enable him to alk ufeful or neceflhry queftions. While the Author was proceeding up the Euphrates , the Hie , and the Ti gris , he compiled a fmall vocabulary tor his own ufe, which he found afterwards of infinite fervice. When the traveller arrives at Bagdad, he will find that the Englifh are more refpe^fed than any other nation ; he will therefore feel the necefsity of ading in the moft honourable manner in every tranfadion, that he may fupport the dig nity of the national character; lor fuch is the illiberal way of thinking among thefe people, that fhould an individual ot any country act meanly, the people would condemn all his nation; and the bad con duct of one perfon might thus endanger the lives of hundreds of his countrymen, who might adopt the fame route. Fromxu preface* From Bagdad there is but one mode of travelling, whieh is under the guidance and prote&amp;Lon of the Tatars, or meiiengers of government. Thefe men are under the immediate orders of the Balhaw and his mini lie rs; but are at all times ready to enter into any contract with an individual, which they ufually make very profitable to themfelves, particularly when they have to conduct thofe who are enabled to ob tain firmauns *; for, by virtue of thele, the Tatars are enabled to take feveral horfes and attendants, and a large quantity of merchandize on their return, which pays them very well. In the Author's fir- maun it was intimated that he was an Englifh Conful, which enabled his Tatar to obtain guards (free of expence) when ever there was danger to be apprehended from the wandering tribes. This is by far * Thefe give the Tatar and traveller a greal deal of authority over the people, particularly over thofe who are appointed by government to accommodate the T atars. thePREFACE. xlii t-lic fafeft way of travelling, as tlie pcrfon ot a Conful is feldom infulted. Great jcare, however, fhould be taken when an agreement is about to be made with a Tatar, It is advifable to pay him only halt of the money agreed lor at Bagdad , that he may have an intereft in delivering the traveller fate at Constan tinople . Care fhould be taken alfo, that the Tatar does not engage to carry mer chandize for any one, which he will do if pofsible. The necefTanes which the traveller takes ihould be comprelTed into as narrow a com- pafs as pofsible. A little tea, coffee, and lugar, will be ferviceable in the winter feafon; and fome Ipirits, either brandy or iiollands, may be ufeful; but he ihould by no means be encumbered with either of thele in fummcr, as it would be highly dangerous to drink any fpirits in that cli mate in the heat of that feafon.

The traveller fhould be equipped in the fame manner as the Tatar, which will al ways enfure him refpech Some have at tempted to travel under the characler of the Tatar's fervants (the Armenian mer chants in particular do this); but the Au thor confiders it as too degrading for the character oi an EnglWhman. ihc I a tars, who are accuftomed to travel very fait, ufually ride llie hind mod horfe of the company, and whip the other beafts to keep them going. This fhould never be permitted; but whoever attempts a jour ney of this kind Ihould be a good horle- man. The traveller ought not to encumber him lei f with fpecie, except about half a dozen piaftres, to give as prefents to thofc who may render fome little fervices. He will, it is true, be often folicited for gifts, but fhould always refer the applicants to hispreface. xt bis Tatar ; and when they find that, they will not apply a fecond time. It is much more prudent to take hills drawn by the merchants, which will ufually meet due honour, while they offer no temptation to robbers. From Constantinople , it* the tra veller be unacquainted with the language, it will be necefl'ary to engage a Janizary to conduct him to the frontiers, who will be paid in about the fame proportion as the Tatars. It has often been a fubjed of inquiry, which is the fpeedieft method of forward ing difpatches to and from India . The Author is of opinion, that the route by which he came mult be the moft expedi tious for forwarding difpatches to India. When the mellenger arrives at Bagdad, he can fct out immediately in a Kiraffe down the Tigris till he reaches the Hie, down which he will proceed till he enters the Euphrates . By this channel he may he able to reach Buss or a in three days whichxvl preface. which muft be much quicker than going I by land to Hilla , and from thence down the Euphrates. r The ufual mode of forwarding dif- patches from India is by the way of Bus- sora , over the Great Defert to Aleppo ; j from thence to Constantinople , and afterwards by the German poll to V ienna and Hamburgh . This is certainly done at an eafy expence, and much lefsthan by way of Bagdad ; but the latter would, no doubt, be a quicker route in cafe of necefsity, as the Arabs are obliged to crofs the Great Defert on camels.A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, TOIVARDS ENGLAND. O n the 41h of May 1797, at eight P. M. left Bombay , and embarked on board the country (hip Pearl, R. Spence, Mailer, bound to Bussora ; having in company James Stevens , Efq. in the Civil Service, Capt. John Reid , late Commander of the Princefs Royal India- man, and Mr. James Morley. We had pleafant weather and fmooth water, with light airs from the W. N. W. and N. W. which continued till the 12th, when we were in lat. 11°. 9 / . North, and 6 L 2°. 16'. Eaft longitude. It then began to grow cloudy, and the wind increafed. B On2 a journey from india, On the 15th, in North lat. U 0 . 42 , . we had a frefh breeze, W. by N. with a heavy fvvell from the N. W. and a ftrong current fetting to the Eaftward. On the 17th, at half pafl one, A. M. pafled a fmall fliip bearing Eaft, diftant about a quarter of a mile; and at fun- rife, fhe bore S. S. E. dirtant five or fix miles. We fuppofed her to be an Arab Ihip, called the Morning Star. With frefh breezes from the N. W. the fhip ran at the rate of feven and eight knots. On the 18th we had ftrong gales from .the Weft, and the weather cloudy. At two A. M. wore ihip to the Southward, fuppofing that we were in foundings. Thick and hazy all round, with a very heavy fwell from the N. W. On the 20th, in 23°. 20'.

At fun-rife, on the 2111, two Arab boats came along-fide with fifh, which we bought at a very moderate price. At feven P. M. the wind E. S. E. fhip going four knots, ob- ferved a dow in chafe of us. From her manoeuvring (fometimes hauling her wind, at others failing free), we fufpedled her to be a pirate. She failed remark ably fafl, and in an hour was in our wake, diflant a cable's length. She then hailed us. Our feapoys immediately fired a volley of mufquetry into her, when Ihe hauled her wind and ran in /hore. On the 24th, at day-break, the G reat Q uoin bore S. W. by S. diftant about four leagues; extremes of the Ifland of K ishme , from W. N. W. to N. W, diftant feven or eight leagues; and the Ifland of O rmus bearing N. by E.4* • a journey from india, We now faw twenty-two dows in chafe of us; fome of the fmall ones, failing very fail upon n wind, foon eame up with us within a cable's length. They were full of men, who were all armed ; we there fore beat to quarters and prepared for aelion, though many oi the large veffels had great guns on board. The imaller ones that had come up with us appeared afraid to begin the attack till the larger had reached them. We were to wind ward of the large dows; and, as a treiii breeze fprung up from the Vvetiward, and thofe veflels are obliged to wear in- ftead of tacking, they made much lee way, by which circumftance we were enabled to keep a-head. They conti nued to chafe us till two P. M. when we had very Itrong gales from the N. W.; and, many of the large dows dropping to leeward very fall, they gave up the chafe, and ran behind the liland ot Kishme. The gal^ increafing, we kept the fea, beating to windward under double -reefed toplails,towards england. 5 topfails, not choofmg to anchor in iliore fer fear oi again meeting with our ene mies. On the 28th we faw a large Aiip in Siiaras Roads, under Arab colours. We continued beating to windward amongft the illands on the Perfian fide of tlie Gulph, the wind ufually blowing from the N. W. till the 30th at noon, when the, extremes of the Perlian fhore bore from N. N. W. to E. by S. diftance four miles. It was now calm, and fo continued for about twelve hours, du ring which time many locufts flew on board; a common indication of flron^ gales Irom the ^s. A\ r . which accordin'lv' o J occurred the next day at three A. M f when, the weather being hazy, we fud- dcnly ran foul of a large Arab dow clofe under our fhip's bows. She had a boat towing aftern. Our bower anchor hooked her high poop and tore it up, carrying away our fprit-fail-yard, the chain of the lhank painter, and the bolts out of the larboard bumpkin. The Arabs im- ^ 3 mediatelyC A journey from india, mediately fell to prayers, and let the dovv drift to leeward. At fun-rife wc faw her in a very fhattered Hate. On the Ifl of J une we had very heavy gales from the N. W. the fliip pitching very much, and making more water than ufual. At eight P. M. furled the top- fails; and at nine, the gale becoming more moderate, fet clofe-reefed fore and main-top-fails, and continued working to windward up the Perfian fide of the Gulph. On the 4th of J une , in 28°. 36'. North lat. faw a large white mofque on the Perfian fhore, bearing E. N. E. diftant three miles, with a town and feveral groves of date-trees along fhore. At eleven A. M. faw the low land about B ushirh, bearing N. by W. We had now a mode rate breeze from the N. A\ r .; and on the 5th, at fix P. M. we anchored in B ushire R oads in four fathom water, the town bearing EafL The Captain immediately w r ent on fhore in the pinnace, to procure / antowards england. 7 an order from the Sheik for the fhip to receive a pilot from the illand of Car- rick , which order coils 200 Bombay rupees. In the roads we found an Eng- lifh brig called the BafTein, belonging to Captain Torin , chartered by the go vernment of Bombay to take bale goods and difpatches from Bombay to Bussorah. She had failed from Bombay three weeks before we did; and Captain Torin in formed us, that he had been captured by twenty-two dows near the ifland of Kishme ; that he was two days in their hands; that when they took him, two large dows, one on each fide, boarded him with above 100 men each, beating their tom-toms, and giving their war-yell; that the weight of the men made his veflel heel very much ; but they had, after plunder ing him by taking away his powder and his pump-gear, with fundry other arti cles, rcleafed him, partly on account of his belonging to the Engli/h Ealt India Company, but chiefly in compliance with the intercefsion of a paflenger, bro ther to the Nabob of Masulapatnam, B 4 a Mulfulman,s a journey from india, a Muffulman, who could fpeak a little Arabic. The Arabs told the Captain, that they were at war with the Emaum ; of Muscat , and had miftaken his veflel ibr the Morning Star belonging to ' Muscat . The lame veflfels had two years before captured a French brig, coppered, which was then lying behind Kishme ; and about fcvcn years back had made prize of another fhip called the Beigly Beig, from Bengal for Bus- : sora , and which was (till lying on the rocks behind the Quoins on the Arabian lliore. We now learned that the large Ihip which we faw in Sharas Roads was a man of war belonging to the Emaum of Muscat , with above 1000 men on board, fent to cruife againft the dows. On the f&gt;th, at four P. M. got under way. At three A. M. tacked; diftance off Carrick three miles. At four A. M. hove-to till day-light, when we made fail with light airs from the S. W. the lead conflantly going. At five A.

We founded around the i (hip, and found 10| feet water forward, 51 fathom aftern, and 4| fathom abreall the main-mart. It was near high water when ttie ft ruck, and the fhipdrew about 15 feet water upon an even keel. Wc hoifted out the pinnace and long-boat, and carried out the beft bower anchor aftcrn, which we let go In 10 fathom water, and attempted to heave her oft, ^ot fuccecding, however, we fired two guns, and fent an Arab (one of the crew) on ^hore to the Sheik for afsirtance. Meanwhile we rtruck the top gallant yards and marts, and threw rtone ballad overboard. At nine A. M. the Sheik Sulliman , with lix. boats and a hun dred men, came to afsift. . We employed all hands in lightening the flup; loaded the fix boats with rice, putting a feapoy in each to guard it ; and made many at tempts to heave the (hip off, but to no purpofe. At noon there came on a Itrong . breeze i Bnil S10 a journey from india, breeze from the N# W. ; and had we not been upon a weather fhore, the fhip muft inevitably have gone to pieces. « On the 7th, at four P. M. we weighed anchor with the long boat, carried it further out, brought the cable to the capftan through the cabin windows, and had it taught. The Sheik and his people ftayed on board all night, the boats with the rice lying at anchor near the fliip, and a feapoy remaining in each. At half paft five A. M. of the 8th, the wind Hill blowing frefh from the N. W. fet the top-fails aback; and, the tide rifing much higher than on the preceding evening, hove the fhip off without having received any apparent damage, not mak ing more water than ufual. We now took the rice on board, cleared the fhip as foon as pofsible, weighed, ran off Car- rick Town, and anchored in 11 fathom. Captain John Reid and myfelf went afhore in a country boat, to try it we could fhoot any antelopes, of which there weretowards england. 11 were many on the ifland, having firft ob tained the Sheik's permifsion. We took with us two Arab guides, and prefently faw about twenty antelopes, which, how ever, were fo very Ihy, that we could not get near enough to have a fhot; nor do 1 think it pofsible to take them without hawks, the mode ufually praftifed in thofe countries. Hie Iwittell grey hounds would be of no ufe, tor the an telopes are much fwifter of foot than any animal I ever faw before. They are of a light fawn colour, about the fize ot a goat, but with longer legs, and have fmall horns almoll ere6h We directed our walk to the highefl part of the ifland, which appears to have been a volcanic produ6lion, having coral rocks and fea fliells on its very fummit; and in many places great quantities ot lava have run down towards the fea. Here is plenty of good water, but very little vegetation, except near the fprings. Being on fhore in the middle ot the day, I found12 a journey trom india, found the heat much greater than I had ev^r experienced in India. On our return to the fhore, we found the Sheik dividing among his people the fifteen bag:*of rice which he had received from Captain Spence for his trouble. He feemed to be perfectly fatisfied with ;thie quantity, though it appeared to Captain Reid and myle.lf to be but a fmall re- compenfe for the important fervices he Lad rendered in faving both fnip and cargo. The Sheik was about fifty years of age, but could neither read nor write. He begged of us to give him fome fmall fbot, which we did, and added to it all the powder we had with us. AVe were alfo Itrongly inclined to have given him both our fowling-pieces, could we pofsi bly have fparcd them, fo much were we pleafcd with the good man's condu6h The ifland of Carrick, which con tains between fix and feven hundred in habitants,towards england. 13 J habitants, is about twelve miles long and I feven broad.

At fix A. M. of the 11th, faw the trankey at anchor in 2* fathom, bearing N. N. E. diftant three miles, with her co lours up, a fignal for her being on the bar. At eight A.

At nine o'clock Captain R eid and myfelf went afhore on the Arab fide of the river, taking with us our guns; but wc only fhot a few wild pigeons, pro cured fome eggs and greens from the Arabs, and bought a bullock for fix piaftres. The extent of our walk inland did not exceed about half a mile, which fpace was planted throughout with date-trees, the male trees being gene rally planted North Well of the fe males, becaufe the wind ufually blows from that point. The males are very eafily diftinguifhed, being higher than the females, and not fo full of leaves at the top. The ground is full of cuts for the purpofe of letting in the water from the river at tide-time ; for without this the (&amp;&gt; :; f1(5 a journey from india, the dates would not thrive, as they re- qiiii : e much moifture. After we had paffed through the plan- tation, we entered fome villages on the 7 O edge of the Defert, beyond which neither trees nor other vegetation were to be feen. All our proipecl confilted of a burning defert covered with a cruft of fait, making a noife under the feet fimi- lar to that caufed by walking on frozen fnow. 'Without being on Ihore in the middle of the day, and at the feafon nenr Mid- fummer, a flranger to this country could not pofsibly form any idea of the heat upon the Defert. The bare feet of an European would be bliflered in a mo ment, and I felt fome inconvenience to mine, even through a pair of ftrong boots. The houfes here are built of clay, and covered with the leaves of the date-tree. 2 - Thetowards england. 17 The Inhabitants are very numerous, and nioft of them have weak eyes, occafioned, probably, by the refledion of the fun upon the defert. Their drefs is very fim- pit; that of the men being 111 general no more than a woollen cap to defend the head from the fun; and a coarfe woollen cloak, with fhort wide fleeves. I fliould obferve, that an Arab always wears his woollen cap, though he has often no other cloathing. The woman's drefs is equally fimple, being only a few yards of blue cotton cloth wrapped round them. / Thefe people have numerous flocks of cattle, iheep, and goats, which they drive every morning at fun-rife to the river fide, where they find very good pafture. They are watched all day by men, women, and children, who frequently amufe. them- Selves by bathing in the river; for an Arab, when he has an opportunity, will bathe five or fix times a day. The flocks are always driven back at fun-fet to the ullages, where they remain all nisht. C Every18 a journey from india, Every village and fixed refidence is fur- rounded with a lofty mud wall, to defend it from hearts of prey, particularly lions, which are here very numerous. The Arab women were not fo fhy as we expelled to find them. They feemed much entertained by the novelty ot our drefs, and very civilly offered us milk, bread, &amp;c. Their bread is in cakes, but not fine; and their milk is not very palatable to an European, being curdled and quite four. It immediately turns four alter fun- rife; but we found that the Arabs pre ferred it in that ftate. Being much amufed with the novelty of the fcene, we remained longer on ihore than we intended. The fiiip, however, getting under way, fired a gun, and hoilted a lisnal for us to return on board. On the Perfian Ihore are the ruins of a very large and ancient city, extending about twelve miles along the banks oi the river, and containing many tombs which ftilltowards england. j9 jfllll appear entire. We were informed, that this city was deftroyed by the Perfian Emperor, N adir S hah ; and among the ruins we deferied feveral wolves. The tide not continuing fo long as we expedled, we had only gained about twelve miles before we were obliged to anchor at three, P. M. the wind blowing ftrong from the N. W. In the whole extent from the fea to this part of the Perfian fide of the river, there is very little culture, and but a thin population. It appears, however, to have been once well cultivated; there are ftill many embankments to prevent the river overflowing the country, and nu merous canals to water the ground, fimilar to thofe on the oppofite Arabian fliorc. As to plantations, we only faw a few ftraggling date-trees, which, being neg- lc6led, bore very little fruit. ttesday,20 a journey from india, tuesday, june 13. W e weighed anchor this morning at two o'clock; but the wind flill blowing frefh from the N. W. and very little flood tide, we only gained about five miles, and anchored again at five. W e now faw numerous herds of cattle, fheep, and goats, with a great many horfes, on the Arabian fide of the river. An Arab Sheik, or a man of any confe- quence, ufually keeps feveral horfes ready faddled, in cafe of any alarm, and is al ways ready to ride off at a moment's notice. Thefe horfes are fed with grafs cut by the lide of the river at low water, or on fome of the iflands, which are very numerous. For this purpofe they make ufe of large bafkets, covered with a coat of bitumen, which effectually keeps out the water, and two men will paddle in them at a tolerable rate. Some of thefe balkets are large enoughtowards england. enough to carry a dozen people, and are frequently ufed as ferry-boats. The wind increafing from the N. W. \\ v e were not able to move with the after noon's tide. wednesday, june 14.

AV. we had no prolpc&lt;5l of reaching B ussora lor lome time. Capt. S pence, therefore, difpatched an Arab fervant with a letter to the Company's Reiident at that place. On the Arabian fide of the river the culture and population were nearly the fame as before; but the Perfian fide had a tetter appearance. Vegetation was there C 3 much22 a journey from india, much more flourilhing; and at fun-fet, a confiderable tribe, with their flocks, began to pitch their tents, not appearing to have any fixed refidence. They lighted fires, which continued burning all night. thursday, june 15. W eighed anchor at three o'clock; but, the wind continuing as before, only gained about fix miles. The Perfian fide ot the river improved in its appearance, having a few fmali villages clofe to the river fide, and fome date-trees. It being rather fwampy, there were alio 41 good many willows, and a few elm-trees. The Arabian fide, too, looked better than what we had lately palled, being cultivated farther from the river. The date-trees | being planted about ten feet from each other, and full of leaves at top, a fiord a very good lhade; and the people arc en* abled to cultivate the ground during the i whole day, without fullering much in convenience [towards england. 23 convenience from the heat of the fun, which out of the fhade, and in the middle of the day, is at this feafon not to be en dured. We found here a very ftrong brown foil, which does not appear to want any manure, nor do the Arabs at this place ever make ufe of any. friday, june 1 (7. G ot under way this morning at four o'clock. The wind continuing as before, and very little flood tide, we only gained two leagues. The Perfian fide of the river now exhi bited a high degree of cultivation. We faw many inhabitants and numerous flocks and herds; but had not much intercourfe with the people, as they are not fo much to be trulted as their oppofite neighbours the Arabs. They are a very ftrong, robult, hard-featured people; and their drefs is nearly fimilar to that of the Arabs. A C 4 piece24- A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, piece of blue callico, About five yards long, is the whole of the woman's drefs, and the children are entirely naked. The men have a very ferocious appearance, and will.deflroy whomfoever they can overpower, which renders it impofsible to travel much in this country. Wild hogs are very numerous among the marlhes, and there are various kinds of game in great plenty, which affords fine fport to a Ihooting party ; but it will be always ne- ceflary to go in a confiderable body, and never very far from the river, to avoid being cut off by the favage inhabitants. The Arabian fide of the river was near ly the fame as before, except that the canals were cut farther inland, which im plied of courfe more cultivation. Some of the canals are very broad, and I crofsed over feveral in the wicker balkets before defcribed, which are indeed very conve nient where there is not much current, SATURDAY,TOWARDS ENGLAND. saturday, june 17. G ot the fhip under way this morning at five o'clock; but for want of wind, only- gained about two leagues. \ A party of us went out a-fhooting on the Arabian fide ot the river, but were not very fuccefsful in our fport. Extend ing our walk inland about three miles, we lound the whole well watered by means ot canals frpm the river, and the population was very great. The dates and other treete afforded an agreeable lhade, and made our little incurfion very pleafant. AVe lound great abundance and many va rieties ol garden vegetables; fome of them European, and feveral peculiar to the country. Befide the dates, which arc the chief fupport of the inhabitants, there were great quantities of pomegranates nearly ripe; red and white grapes, fome of them ripe} an abundance of oranges. Jinxes, and lemons, but none of thefe had attained2d a journey from india, attained maturity. There were alfo many well-tafted apples, chiefly of the kind called codlings, but a little fweeter than thofe in England. We took with us about a bufliei of thefe, for which we paid a very trifling fum. I was very much pleafed with this little journey; and, though I had lately been in the ifland of C eylon among the cinnamon, in the 1 ravencore country, and in every port on the Malabar coaft, I certainly fhould give the preference to this place; for the abundance of various kinds of fruits, the fragrant fmell from the oranges, lemons, and fweet-fcented ihrubs, and the agreeable fhadc of the lofty date-trees, rendered it a moll de lightful fpot. The inhabitants, too, were remarkably civil. There being no regular road, we frequently loft our way; and they would very readily offer their fervices to conduct us into the right path. AVetowards england. 27 We had, however, one advantage, which ftrangers to this country can feldom enjoy; I mean in having feveral Arabs belonging to the fliip, who could interpret for us. We therefore never went on fhore without taking fome of them with us. sunday, june 18. W eighed anchor this morning at five, ran about two leagues only, and anchored again at nine. At half paft three in the afternoon I fet out for B ussora by land, with an Arab guide. We were frequently flopped on the road by foldiers ; but my guide al ways fatisfying them, I was permitted to pafs without moleftation. Many of the inhabitants feemed to view me with afto- nifhment; and in all probability fome of them had never feen an European be fore, this part being out of any accuf- tomed road, and where no one can travel on58 a journey from india, i on horfeback on account of the numerous I canals. The country through which I pafTed had a delightful appearance, being well watered, and in luxuriant vegetation. Ex- tenfive crops of wheat, barley, and paddy, were nearly ripe; and of fruit and ve getables the quantity was immenfe. The city ot B ussora is fupplied from this neighbourhood, and the Turks and Arabs confume a very large quantity in propor- 1 tion to their other food. After walking about ten miles, at half paft fix o'clock I reached the Englilh fac tory at B ussora . Here I obtained a - liorle, and a guide, alfo mounted, and fct out immediately from B ussora for M argill , the country refidence of S a muel M anesty , Efq. t|ie Refident. 1 his (lands about three miles above the city, and is pleafantly fituated on the banks of the river. • I remainedtowards england. 25 I remained a week at M argill , dur ing which time I experienced every mark of civility and hofpitality. Mr. M ane sty fills the office of Refi- dent with great ability, and is defervedly efteemed by every one who lias the plea- luie oi knowing him. His conduct, in every inftance, is mod truly that of an EmgUJIi gentleman', and he has rendered Government very eflential fervices during the prefent war, by feizing the French difpatches, and preventing that nation from carrying on any correfpondence with I ndia by land. During my flay I frequently vifited the c ity 01 B ussora , which is very lar^Q and extremely populous. The Bazar, or Market-place, is near two miles long, a nd appears to be well fupplied. It abounds with drugs of various kinds pecu- ]iar to the country, and which, though confiderable value in E urope , may be ^ 0 ught here at a moderate price, money ^ being30 A journey from INDIA, being of more value here than in many | other countries. . European manufadures are fearce and dear; and the people prefer thofe of E ngland to all others. Our fuperfine broad cloth, and our watches, will fell for more than double what they colt in E ngland. The length of the city walls, from the river toward the Great Delert, is about four miles, and from North to South about three miles. The walls are chiefly built of clay, and of courfe cannot make any very ftout refiftance, particularly againtf artillery. Of this, however, there is very little in the country; in the city, I ob- fcrved only ten pieces, moft of them brafs indeed, but only two or three of them ferviceable. Being expofed to the lun, the carriages were dropping to pieces. Here are feveral mofques and minarets, many of which arc very handfome build ings.towards england. 31 ings. Some of the latter are entirely covered with variegated tiles, which have a very fingular appearance. Moft of the public buildings, as mofques, minarets, and hummums, are built of brick; but the Englifli fa6lory is now by far the befl ftructure in the whole city. Within the walls are feveral vacant fpots not built upon, and which appear to have been occalioned by fire. The houfes in general are very indifferent, being chiefly built of clay with a fmall proportion of bricks. Their timbers are the trunks of date-trees, not fquared, but round, and in the fame llate as when brought from the plantation: they are alfo very foft and fpongy, and will not laft long. The very thick walls, and thefe clumfy tim bers, form together a very uncouth piece of architecture. The roofs are flat, and furroundcd by a parapet. Here the inhabitants ileep du- 5 . ring3 2 a joVrn£y from india, ring the fummer feafon, in the open atf. To an European every houfe appears like a prifon, as it ean receive no light from the ftreet, beeaufe it has no windows. Every houfe forms a fquare, and the inhabitants have no communication with their neigh bours. Within the fquare are various offices; fome under ground, where the people retire during the heat ot the day. The kitchen, the water, and not unfre- quently the horfes, are kept on the ground floor. The hall, where they re ceive company, the harem, and many other offices, are on the fecond, which has generally a gallery fupported by pil lars continued nearly round the infide of the whole building. They have generally two flights of fteps; one leading to the hall, where alone ftrangers are admitted ; the other leading to the harem, to which none but the family can have accefs. Women of the higher clafs are feldom feen out of doors; but when they do go out, /towards england. 33 out, they are always veiled. Many of the Arab women, particularly of the lower clafs, expole their faces. Both men and women flaves are fold publicly in the Bazar. I have before faid, that the city is very populous. The majority of the people are Arabs, the reft are Turks and Armenians. The Turks are moflly men ol fome confequencc, either being officers in the army, or holding fome other polls under government. The Armenians are the merchants, and fome of them are very refpeaable. They have aconfiderable trade with the E ast I ndies, and chiefly to B engal . In this trade feveral fhips are employed, the largeft of which does not exceed 400 tons, on ac count of a difficulty in crofsing the bar. The Ihips from B ussora to B ombay , or B engal , ufually receive a full cargo, the greater part of which confifts of cop per in fmall cakes and drugs of various kincis; and the B ombay fhips generally take dried fruits. It is very feldom, how- O ever,J 34 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, ever, that a veffel fails to any part of I ndia without taking a confidcrable num ber of Arab horfes. There are many in- fiances of (hips carrying away filver, in bars and fpecie, to the amount of twenty lacks of rupees, the fpecie chiefly in Spanifti dollars and Venetian fequins. The greateft part of the trade of this branch of the Turkifli empire is in the hands of the Armenians, who, when they have a confiderable fum on hand, in order to prevent the Turks from laying hold of it, (which is fometimes the cale) export it to I ndia , where they often receive 12 per cent, intereft. The intereft is ufually remitted back in piece goods, with which they fupply the greatefl part of the Turkirti empire. A confiderable quan tity of fugar and rice alfo is trequently imported from I ndia . The fpecie is fent here by the Armenians to their corrc- fpondents in moll parts of the empire: confiderable fums likewife are often fent from Constantinople . Thefe arc ufu ally forwarded under the care of tie 7 Tatars,towards england* Tatars*, meflengers of government, who receive a handfome premium for their trouble. The Tatars, however, are fome- times robbed and flain by the wandering tribes, who in formidable bodies infelt the greater part ot the Turkifh dominions in A sia. An thftance of this happened only a month ago, when a Tatar, return ing from C onstantinople to B agdad with 6000 Venetian fequins, was attacked, robbed, and murdered, between D iar- bekir and M osul. With rcfpedl to the Arabs, the moft numerous qlafs of inhabitants, there are a tew refpedtable men amonglt them; but great numbers are extremely poor, la bouring very hard for fmall wages. With a very little pay, however, they are enabled to fupport their families; for their drefs cofts them little; and their food confifts of dates, bread, and water, with which they * Ufually, but very improperly, printed Tartar.

D 2 are36 a journey from india, are perfeftly fatisfied; and indeed, though their food is fo fimple, they have, gene- rally fpeaking, twice the ftrength of Europeans, and are able to endure much more fatigue. The ftreets in this city are fo extremely narrow, as frequently to admit only one horfe at a time; added to which, they are in many parts fo very rough as to make it difficult for horfes to pafs. Here is a Roman Catholic Church, a tolerably good building; and the people of that perfuafion are not in the leaft mo- lefted. Every perfon wears the drefs of the country, particularly muftaches. I met here with the famous Armenian J oseph E min , who had been many years in Eng land, and has lately publilhed, in the Englilh language, his travels and adven tures, written by himfelt. He propofe going with his Ion to B engal , and thence lk&gt; take him to E ngland. I made him antowards england, 37 an offer to take his fon with me to E ng land , as he would have been a very good interpreter, underftanding the Armenian, Arabic, TurkHh, and Englifli, languages. The fon, who was about 17 years of age, was very willing to accompany me; but the father, after deliberating fome time, determined on following his origi nal plan. sunday, june 25. E very thing having been prepared, under the direction of Mr. M anesty , for our departure for B agdad , an Arab Sheik, named A bdallah T eef , a very rcfpe6table man, engaged to conduct us fafely thither; for which we paid him 1300 piaflrcs. This fum, it is to be ob- ferved, was only for three boats and guards, having ourfelves provided a good, ftack of provifions of all forts, with cu linary utenfils, cooks, and other fervants, which coft us 500 piaftres more. D 3 The38 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, The clothes provided for each perfon were as follow : 1 Arab camellne, or riding cloak. 2 Under coats. 2 Pairs of drawers, 2 Shirts. 1 Cuniberband, 1 Turban. 1 Woollen cap; and 1 Pair of yellow flippers. Our boats being brought up to M ar- gill , at five o'clock we took leave of Mr. M anesty , and embarked; two of the boats containing the paffengers, the other boat our additional guards: Imme diately after embarking, we were drelled fo as exactly to refemble the Arabs in our appearance ; and our muftaches were now grown pretty long,' having n,ever lhaved fince we left I ndia, Every attention was paid to our pcrfonal fafety, the Sheik being always in one of ourtowards england. 59 our boats, and his brother, A hmood S ollay , in the other. As thefe boats were admirably calcu lated tor their intended purpofe, the fol lowing account of them may not be unac ceptable : Defcriptmi of the boat generally called a Donek, hut fometimes a Km/ffe, ufed by the Arabs upon the rivers E uphrates and T igris., The extreme breadth is 7 feet 0 inches. The length 42 feet. It is built of ftrong rough timbers at 18 inches di(lance, con- nedled by fmall rough pieces of board, and covered with a coat of bitumen about half an inch thick on the outfide, which, in cafe ot a leak, is very eafily repaired. The infide is lined with the fame kind of rough boards, none above 3 feet long, and of very unequal breadths; the lining is, ot courfe, lull oi holes.—Some of thefc boats, inftead of boards, are covered with D 4 bafket-40 a journey from india, bafket-work, having a coat of bitumen upon it.—They are very fharp at each end, and fail faft.—Their oars are rough poles, having a piece of board tied on with a cord. They have befides ftrong timbers, which go down to the keel, and are about 3 feet above the gunwale ; thefe are full of notches, to which they fallen the oars with ftrong kya rope; and by thefe means they either raife or lower the oar, as is moft convenient. They have no tiller; but are enabled to fleer with great accuracy by means of a ftrong kya rope faftened to both fides of the rudder; and they very feldom ufe more than live oars at a time. 'We had part of the boat, abaft the maft, covered with mats to defend us from the fun, which we found of great fervice. In the fore-part was a place built with brick and clay for the purpofe of drefsing our vi6tuals; and this convenience we foundtowards england. 41 found of great ufe, as it enabled us to provide every thing neeeffary without de laying the parage by frequent landings. Thefe boats ufually go from H illa down the E uphrates to B ussora in three days, and are feldom four. From B agdad down the T igris to B ussora they can never go in lefs than eight days, though the ft ream is much more rapid than the E uphrates ; but it is above twice the length, on account of the many windings, and it runs a great way to -the Eaitward towards P ersia. We had a very pleafant breeze from the Southward, and with fails ^nd oars went at the rate of five miles an hour, fleering due North till 12 o'clock. monday, june 26, T he wind decreafing, we continued rowing till day-light at the rate of three ^iles an hour, when we flopped a fhort time42 a journey from india, time on the Peril an fide of the river, for our people to refrefh. On the Arabian fide, above M argill, there is neither cultivation, inhabitants, nor even vegetation, except near the banks of the river, where we faw a great number of camels grazing. Here was alfo much game. The Perfian fide of the river had a better appearance, exhibiting extenfive plantations of date-trees, and many vil lages. The river is here about two miles broadj bearing N, N. W. and S. S. E. The tide fetting down, and having little wind, we were obliged to track. At ele ven o'clock we crofied the mouth of a very large river on the Perfian fide, called by the natives S hat-el- A jam ; which, in Arabic, fignifies a river of Persia; and they had no other name for it. Attowards england. 43 At one o'clock we arrived at C orny, the conflux of the rivers E uphrates and T igris . Here we remained two hours, and obferved that the T igris bore E. N.E. and the E uphrates due W. A Ihlp of war was moored near the middle, be tween the two rivers, as a guard-fhip, and to prevent veflfels pafsing without paying cuftoms. The two rivers, united here, form an immenfe body of frefh water. From this place to the Perfian Gulph is called by the natives S hat-el- A rab. The tide has feldom any influence fo far as C orny , except at the full and change of the moon; and even then the water is only raifed a little; the current is not turned. C orny is fuppofed by fome, learned men to have been the fcitc of the Garden of Eden, Its prefent wretched appearance, however, gives it no pretenfions to the name of the Terreftrial Paradife, as de scribed by M ilton . It is a fmall village, fur-* 4^ a journey from india, furrounded by a. mud wall; contn.ining few inhabitants, with very little cultivation. There is, indeed, a fmall plantation of date-trees between the village and the river, and which forms a very agreeable ihade. Here the Arabs fit and fpend moft of their time, feeming to depend for their livelihood much more on their exactions from paffcngers, than on their own in- duftry. The officers of the cuftoms expected a prefent from our Sheik; but as he had no I merchandize under his care, he did not I pay any thing. We left C orny at three o'clock, and went up the E uphrates , which is called by the Arabs S hat-el- F raate . We now crofled over to the weftern banks of the river; but having little wind from the Eaft, and being obliged to track and row, we went at the rate ot only three miles an hour. The country here was very little inhabited, being wet, fwampy, and | covered with reeds and willows, I fi rC ^ at 1towards england. 45 at a crai'ie among the willows; and in- ftantly after the report, a large herd of wild hogs ruflied out, fome of them of fuch extraordinary lize, that at firft fight I could fearcely believe they were hogs. Their colour is a deep red. In the neighbourhood of Buss or a fome wild hogs have been killed, whofe carcaffes have weighed 10 cwt. Englifti. As the Arabs do not eat them, they are permitted to remain unmolefted. It is faid, that they continue growing as long as they live; and indeed the immenfe fize of fome of them feems to fan6tion fuch an opinion. At fun-fet we faw feveral jackalls prowling near the banks of the river. I fired at one with ball, and killed it. We continued rowing and tracking till eight o'clock, when we made our boats lafi; to the weftern banks of the river near a large tomb, where we remained all night, but had very little relt, the muf- quitoes being extremely troublefome, and the howling of the jackalls, wolves, and 5 other46 A journey from india, other wild beads, in the neighbourhood^ rendering our fituation truly difmal. TUESDAY, JUNE 27. A t day-break we refumed our voyage, tracking up the right bank of the river. The country here afforded a pleafing pro- fpe(5l, abounding with plantations of date- trees and fields of corn. At two o'clock we pafled feveral Arab encampments, near which were great numbers of cattle, buf faloes, fheep, and goats. At three we pa/Ted a breach in the right bank of the river, which has overflowed the Great Defert for about three hundred miles, and has alarmed the inhabitants of B ussora and that neighbourhood very much. The excefsive heat of the fun, with the im- menfe numbers of filh and animalcules that perifh when it dries up, ferve to pu- trify the air, which in general proves fatal to great numbers; and hence the Arabs call it the water of death. HerefflWWW towards england. 47 Here were many men employed to ftop the breach; but with all their humble ef forts, it appeared that it would be fome time before they woidd be able to accom- plifli it. They were carrying along em bankments made of bundles of reeds, which were often forced away by the lire am as foon as they were laid. I am perfuaded that half a dozen Englifhmen, with proper implements and materials, would complete in a few hours what fifty of thefe people could not finilh in a week. At fun-fet we made our boats faft to the right banks of the river, on which wc remained all night; but, as on that pre ceding, we could get very little reft on account of the mufquitoes, and the hor rible noifes made by the wild beafts in the vicinity. wednesday, june 28. A t day-break unmoored, and conti nued tracking as before. We pafl'ed feve- *2. ral48 a journey from india, ral more breaches in the banks, which had overflowed great part of the neighbouring country, and prevented the inhabitants from fowing their corn and paddy. We Jikewife palled feveral Arab encampments with abundance of cattle. Our continu ing always on the fame fide of the river was matter of choice merely, and becaufe we did not perceive any thing interefting on the oppolite Ihore. The courfe of the river is from W. to W. by S. At fun-fet we arrived at a very large town on the right bank of the river called Suke-shue . Here Mr. Stevens , Captain Reid , and myfelf, procured each a muf- quito tent, which we found of infinite fervice, as it enabled us to get a little fleep, which we very much wanted. Though we always laid upon the bare ground, we were now enabled to fleep very comfortably, being relieved from thofe tor menting infers, by whom I have been frequently fo much bitten as to be fcarce- ly able to open my eyes. THURSDAY,towards england. 49 thursday, june 29, AV r e remained at Suke-shue the whole day, fome of my boatmen having behaved impertinently to Ahmood Sollay , who drew his tolwa on one ot them, and was with difficulty prevented from taking his head off. Our Sheik, therefore, difcharged the boat and crew, and procured another of the fame kind. Of courfe, all our ftores were to be moved, and a new place built for our cook to drefs the victuals in. We were here treated by our Sheik j With a dinner in the Arab falhion. It i confided of a dozen and a half of fifh, | about the fize of mackarcl, fryed in ghie; a dozen boiled fowls; and cakes made of Parley flour, fre/h baked, with plenty of nidk. M c fat upon the ground, agree- a ^ e to the cuftom of the country, in a garden adjoining the river, under the ude of a grove of date and fig-trees. lle filh, fowls, and bread, were very E fweet50 A JOURNEY FROM lNt)lA, fvvcet and good; but the milk was four, and not very palatable to an European. We did not make ufe of knives and lorks, as in Europe, but ate with our fingers, as the Arabs do, tearing the fowls and fifli in pieces; and the Sheik feemcd highly pleafed by our compliance with their culloms. I was much amufed by obferving the j dexterity of the Arab women in baking their biead. They have a Imall place built with clay, between two and three feet high, having a hole at the bottom, for the convenience of drawing out the afhes, fomething fimilar to that ot a lime kiln. The oven (which I think is the , moft proper name lor this place) is ufually about fifteen inches wide at top, and gra dually grows wider to the bottom. ^ is heated with wood, and when fufo- ently hot, and perfedly clear from fmoke, having nothing but clear embers at bot tom (which continue to reflect great heat)) they prepare the dough in a large bo^l and mould the cakes to the dcfired fi zeIliuilllll TOWARDS ENGLAND, on a board or ftone placed near the oven. Alter they have kneaded the cake to a proper confiftence, they pat it a little, then tofs it about with great dexterity in one hand, till it is as thin as they choofe to make it. They then wet one fide of it with water, at the fame time wetting the hand and arm with which they put it into the oven. The wet fide of the cake ad heres fafl to the fide of the oven till it is fufficiently baked, when, if not paid pro per attention to, it would fall down among the embers. If they were not exceed- ingly quick at this work, the heat of the oven would burn the fkin from off their hands and arms j but with fuch amazing dexterity do they perform it, that one woman will continue keeping three or four cakes at a time in the oven till /lie has done baking. J his mode, let me add, docs not require half the fuel that is made ufe of in Europe. Suke-shue is a very large and popu lous town, and the refidence of Sheik Iwyney , a very powerful Arab Prince; E 2 having52 a journey from india, having under his government the whole of the right bunks of the Euphrates , from nearly as high as Hilla down to Bussora. He was once in open rebellion againft the Turkifh government, and took poffefsion of the city of Bussora . Being defeated by the prefent Bafhaw of Bagdad , he fled into Persia ; but afterwards returned to folicit his pardon; and as he was much revered by the Arabs, and likely to prove a powerful enemy, the Bafhaw thought it prudent to pardon him, and reinflate him in his government. He was not here, how ever, at this time; for, being a moll able general, he had been fent by the Bafhaw of Bagdad , to oppofe the progrefs of the Waaby , who is extending his conquefts up the weftern Ihore of the Perfian gulpb, almofl: as high as Grain , and propagating a new religion, which, like Mahomet, he enforces by the fword. The Sheik's army amounts to thirty thoufand men; of whom ten thoufand are Turkifh foldicrs, and twenty thoufand Arab recruits.. I tooktowards england. 53 i took a walk with our Sheik through the town, and went into the Bazar, or market, which is about a mile long. It is opened at fun-rife, and continues till nine o'clock; it is then fhut up, opened again at three, and continues till fun-fet. Ihe Sheik alfo took nfe into a coflee- Iioule, where I was treated with coffee, alter the cuftom of the country. I was alfo obliged to fmoke tobacco, they pre senting me with a pipe about a yard and halt long. I fat down on a mat crofs- legged, like the reft of the company, and they ferved the colfee in a fmall China cup about the fize of half an egg-fhell; but I could not get either milk or fugar, with out which the beverage was rather un- pleafant, till I became accuftomed to it. friday, june 50. T his morning the Sheik who officiated ln the abfence of Sheik Twyney paid us a E 3 vifit,54- a journey from india, vifit, and brought his daughter with him. She was about twelve years of age; and every perfon was obliged to ftand in his prefence, except ourfelves and our Sheik. I had here an opportunity of obferving the refpedl which the Arabs pay to their Chiefs. An Arab of diftinaion, having a letter of fome'confequence tor the Sheik, prefented it on his knees, and received it back again in the fame pofture, the fecrer tary having, after reading the letter, put the Sheik's feal on the back ol it. / The Sheiks and principal people wear on the left hand a neat filver or gold ring, in which a frpiare Hone is fet, with their names engraved on it at full length. On this ring they lay a thick ink, till it will make a fair imprefsion, then flamp it on the letter, and this ferves for their figii a - ture. Some of the ftones are red, and fome white cornelians. We were much peftered here by a num ber of people having different ditordcrs, ^ 1 theytowards england. 55 they Imagine that an European can cure all complaints, and implicitly adopt whatever is prefcribed for them. Our Sheik now engaged to take another boat under his protection to Bagdad . It contained a few bales of Bengal piece- goods, and had for paffengcrs an Arme nian woman, with her fon, about fixteen, i and two daughters, one about fourteen, the other thirteen years of age. Setting out from Suke-shue at eleven o'clock, and leaving one boat behind, we crofsed the river, and tracked up the left banks till three o'clock, when we re- crofled, and made our boats faft near a village called Gomcreek , where we pitched our tents. There being much game in the neigh bourhood, I took my gun, and having an Arab with me to carry my powder and • fiiot, faw fome beautiful green birds, which I wiftied much to examine. It was not long before I brought one down ; but the K 4 Arab56 a journey from india, Arab ran immediately and cut off its Lead, calling out zam, zain, meaning that it was very good to eat. I afterwards Ihot fevxN ral birds of different kinds, all of which the Arab ferved in the fame way, nor could T prevent him. Several branches of the river meeting at this place, we found ftationed here a Collector of the Cuftoms, who was a na tive of Constantinople , on which he valued himfelf not a little. He was a very great drunkard, and would do any thing tor wine. We gave him a few bot tles of Sbiras, confidering old Madeira and old Claret as too good for him. He was greatly pleafcd with our prefent, and foon became intoxicated. saturday, july I. AVe waited here this morning till nine o'clock for one of our boats which had been left at Suke-shue ; ' as foon as it came up, we departed. 5 ' Thetowards england. Ihe river, a little above this place, is very broad, nearly as far as the eye can reach; but in many mparts it is fo very fliojl, that reeds make their appearance above the furface of the water. We now altered our courfe to the Eaftward, and entered a river called by the Arabs S hat -* el-I)egela , which communicates with another named Shat-el-Hie , beinsr branch of the Tigris. I cannot quit the Euphrates without taking notice ot its falubrious water, whicli is by much the moft pleafant that I ever tafted. 1 hough very muddy when it is: firft taken up, it foon becomes perfectly elear; and while I could get this water, I had not the leall delirc for either wine or fpirits. We continued tracking up the ^ ut ^or rather canal) called Shat-el- Degela till iix o'clock, when we mad« our boats fall to the banks, and pitched our tents not tar from fome Arab encamp* wents. Our58 a journey from india, Our Sheik reprefented to us, that this was a very dangerous fituation, and re commended us to keep our arms in our tents, in cafe of an attack. ^ e had each a gun, a brace of piftols, and a fabre; and our Sheik, his brother, and all the guards, remained under arms during the night. They placed fome centinels at a dillance from the tents for fear of a furprize, and palled the watch-word from one to an other the night through. We were not, however, molelled. To be obliged to have weapons by my fide while lying down on the bare eaith to take a little reft, was what I had never before experienced. Whoever travel through thefe countries, ought not to put fo much value on his life as I conceive Europeans in general do where they arc perfectly fecure, except from cafualtics. This country is in a ftate of perpetual warfare; many of the inhabitants, under no controul, live in a ftate of nature, ai^ are not fufceptible of the nobler pafsions-TOWARDS ENGLAND. 59 They murder and plunder, without re- morfe, all whom they can overpower, and are at war againft all the world, except their own tribe. Such is the prefent Hate qf one of the moft fertile countries in the univerfe. No traveller is fafe, having rcafon to expert every moment to be at tacked by a fuperior force; but when I un dertook this journey I was perfectly re- figned, and prepared to encounter diffi culties and dangers. Our Sheik conduced himfelf much to our fatisfa&amp;ion, and did every thing in his power to make us com fortable. sunday, july 2. This morning we tlruck our tents at day-break, and at eight o'clock arrived at the head of the Degela , when we en tered a larger river, which is divided into two branches: the one that we went up running S. E. the other W. AV r e pro ceeded up this river in a courfe almoft due N. Whether' €0 A journey from india, Whether thefc branches have been cut to water the country, or not, is uncertain; but I am inclined to t-hink they have. The ground for about forty yards from the river is ufually three or four feet higher than it is further inland. This I have fre quently obferved when I have gone a-ihooting. The larger branches are often near a quarter of a mile broad, and the fmaller about half that diftance. They make the country through which they run exceedingly fertile; but I have no doubt that thefe different branches are much larger than they were originally, and that they are ftill increafing, as the T igris, from which they are fupplied, is much more rapid than the E uphrates , parti cularly at this feafon, when the frelhes are coming down from the fnowy moun tains. At twelve o'clock we entered the river called by the Arabs S hat-el- II ie , run ning from the N. N. W. We found it di vided into three other branches, befide the one at which we entered; two branches runningTOWARDS ENGLAND. 61 running Weft, and one Eaft of that we came up. At one o'clock, pafsing the mouth of a river running from the Eall, we continued tracking till four, when we refted an hour to refrefh, and at fix made our boats la ft to the banks, where we re mained all night. I obferved that our Sheik always chofe as open a country as he could find, to re main in all night, for fear of being at tacked by the Arabs at a dlfadvantage. We were again much difturbed by the jackalls, who feemed very near us, and made a moft hideous noife. monday, july 3. W e ftruck our tents, and fet out at hm-rife, continuing to track up the river S hat-el- H ie . At ten o'clock the courfe the river was from N. N. E.; at eleven, ^ue North, and it continued nearly North ^11 fix o'clock, when we made our boats faftI A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, fall to the banks, and were foon after vl- iited by feme Arabs on horfeback. 1 hey were about twenty in number, armed with fpears and tolwas. As the horfemen ap proached, our Sheik, with a double-bar relled gun in his hand, walked about twenty yards to meet the Chief of the other party, who alfo advanced before his people about the fame diftance. After fome conver- fation between the two Chiefs, the whole advanced. I obferved that the Chief was mounted on a beautiful Arab marc, and I remarked it to be a general rule, that Sheiks and men of confequence are always mounted on mares, which are ufually va lued at three times the price of horfes. To thofe who are ftrangers to the lan- I guage, manners, and cultoms, ol this country, it is no unufeful thing to re collect, that whenever a man is mounted on a mare it may be depended on that he is above the common clafs. Drcfs can not be relied on; for a Sheik will often have his meaneft fervant drefTed mueh better than himfelf, and will eat out ot theTOWARDS ENGLAND. G$ the fame dilh with him, as if they were equals. Shooting being the only amnfement I could enjoy, and here being plenty of game, I wifhed to embrace every oppor tunity. I had ufually taken an Arab or two with me on thefc expeditions; but here I could not prevail on any one to ac company me, and was particularly defired by the Sheik not to go, there being much jungle, from which I might be furprized by the Arabs, or attacked by lions, which he faid were very numerous in this neigh bourhood. Our Sheik fully expe6led a night-attack, and therefore, with his brother and all the guards, remained un der arms all night, the Sheik conllantly walking round our tents with a double- barrelled gun in his hand. A very good look-out, and probably the preparations which the horfemen obferved us to be making for our defence, prevented our being molefted. TUESDAY,\ a journey from india, tuesday, july 4. T his morning we ftruck our tents, and departed at a quarter pad four o'clock. At fix we arrived where two rivers meet; one branch running from the N. N. W. the other from E. by N. AVe took the latter, and continued tracking till twelve o'clock, when we refted under the fhadc of fome willows till three; for, in the middle of the day, the heat of the fun was fo excefsive, that our boatmen were not able to endure it. They were in general nearly naked, having no other covering than a fmall woollen cap, which barely fits the crown of the head. I he couiie of the river winding from North to AV eft, we obferved the banks of Ihofe large branches feven and eight feet above the furface of the water. I have not feen one flone the natural produce of the country fince I leU Bus- sora ? but a foft brown foil, very deep; andtowards England. 65 and a bank of feven or eight feet does not make the lead alteration in the colour of the foil. The rapid current continues deepening the beds of thefe rivers, and in confequcnce the Arabs are not able to water many parts of the country, which renders it uninhabitable except on the banks of the river. Where they cannot have water, the excefsive heat of the fun foon deftroys all vegetation, and particu-« larly at this feafon. At five o'clock we pafled a village on the Weftern banks of the river, called W aasut . The river is here above half a mile broad. Our Sheik was particularly careful not to go near the village, but con tinued tracking up the oppo/ite banks, and made as much hade as pofsible. u All tlie inhabitants, ,, faid the Sheik, ' are dcfperate thieves, and have no mercy on tbfe who are fo unfortunate as to fall into their hands; for they are under no govern ment or controul except that of their own Naders, who are every whit as bad as them- felves.' F At* 66 A journey from india, At lix o'clock we made our boats fall: to the weflern banks of the river, not being able to find a convenient place on the oppo- fitc fide. We pitched our tents clofc to the water's edge, the Sheik keeping a good look-out for fear of a furprize; nor was 1 permitted to fhoot, for fear the report fhould difcover where we were, having a very thick jungle behind us. wednesday, july 5. W e ftruck our tents and fet out this morning at one o'clock, our Sheik not thinking it fafe to remain in fuch a neigh bourhood after the moon went down. At fix o'clock we flopped to refrefh, and in half an hour continued our courfe, the river winding very much, and bearing from S. W. to North. We re (ted under fome willows from twelve till two; and at three arrived at the town called H ie , from which this river takes its name. It is fi- tuated on the Eafiern banks; and, the in habitants of this town not being much 2 bettertowards england- 67 better than thofe of W aasut, our Sheik muftered all his guards a little above the town, amounting to thirty men, all ex ceedingly well armed, and dreffed in their bcft clothes. On account, I fuppofe, of their formidable appearance, our Sheik was not required here to pay any thing. He fpread a carpet on the ground, and with his brother, and another principal officer, fat down, having all the guards under arms drawn up near them. Here they were vifited by the principal men in the town, who were treated with pipes and coffee. The Sheik, however, kept the double-barrelled gun lying on the car pet belore him, and ready to fire in a mo ment; the other officers and men being: dually prepared. Ibis ceremony mult appear very ftrange to thofe who are wholly unacquainted ^ith the fingular manners and cuftoms of thefe people; but all this caution is per- le % necefTary till they have given the Mam and ate together. When that has F 2 been68 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, been done, there can be no room for ap- prehenfion. An Arab, after he has eaten or drank with another, let him he ever fo Treat a (banger, and of whatever religion or country, would fooner periih than fuller him to receive the leaft injury, either in perfon or property; and whoever, in dif- trefs, puts himfelf entirely under the pro- teflion of an Arab, may rely upon being defended in the moft faithlul manner. An inftance of this fingular trait in the charafter of the Arabs occurred not long ago. A Frenchman was carrying dif- patches to I ndia , acrofs the Great Defcrt, from A leppo to B ussora . He had witi him an Interpreter, and an efcort of about eighty men, moitly on camels. ben about five days journey from B ussora, they were attacked in the evening by a wandering tribe of Arabs. The Meilenger had a double-barrelled gun, with which he Ihot the Sheik of the hoftile party; but they ru(hed with fuch fury at the firlt onfct, that before he had time to charge again, he was cut down with a fabre.TOWARDS ENGLAND. Mod of the MefTenger's guards being killed, they were ftripped by the con querors, and the Meflenger among the reft, it being imagined that he was dead. After the engagement, the Arabs lighted fires to make coffee and refrefti thcmfelves; and, as is cuftomary with them, fat on the ground in a circle round the fire. The MefTenger's wound not proving mortal, (for though he had one fide of his face cut down, his fkull was not mate rially injured) he at length recovered his fenfes; and finding himfelf entirely naked as well as much weakened by the lofs of blood, he had nearly given himfelf up to defpair. But, recollecting to have heard oi: this fingular difpofition in the Arabs, ne refolvcd to try the experiment, as the only means of faving his life, or putting an end to his exiftence.'- He took a view ol the Arabs fitting round the fire, and fingled out him whom he thought moft likely to be the Chief, as being the oldeft- looking man in the company. Naked as F 3 he70 a journey from india, * he was, and almoft covered with blood, he rufhed into the ring, and threw him- felf at his feet. His conjecture was right. This old man was the Chief, who immedi ately covered him with his cloak. He was now at a lofs for an Interpreter; but, on fearch being made, the Intrepreter was found in a fnnilar Htuation, wounded, but not dangeroufly. The Meflenger had his clothes and difpatchcs returned to him; and the Chief entered into an agreement to deliver him fafe at B ussora , on the Mef- fenger promifing to pay him one hundred Venetian fequins. Both parties performed their agreement; the Meffenger arrived fafe, and had engaged a dow to take him to M uscat . This having reached the Englilh Refident's ears, he feized the MelTenger with his difpatches, and had his wounds dreffed by the Englifh Surgeon. It was imagined that the Meflenger, it fulfered to proceed, would not have reached I ndia , as his wounds required much furgical afsiftance. Buttowards england. 71 But to return from this digrefsion: It is cuftomary for thefe people to lay very heavy contributions on veflels and palTengers that pafs this way, or plunder them when they do not eomply with their demands; and in cafe of the leaft refin ance, they will feize the boats and murder every perfon on board. In this they have an advantage over boats going up the river, which being obliged to track againft both wind and ftream, their progrefs is feldom more than four miles an hour; but going downwards there is very little dan ger; for the current being very rapid, and the wind ufually blowing frefh from the N. W. all velfels go at a great rate, and particularly the fmall doncks, which fail remarkably fail. H ie is a fmall town furrounded by a mud wall; but the in habitants are very numerous in proportion to the fize of the place. We left it at five o'clock, and continued tracking till half paft feven, our men making more hafte than ufual, to get as far as pofsible out of F 4 the72 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, the reach of thofe people, left they fhould attack us in the night. We made our boats faft to the oppofite banks of the river. The locufts in this country are very nu merous. I caught one this evening of a different colour from the common locuft, and much larger. Its very extraordinary appearance induced me to make a fketch of it from life, of the exadl natural fize. Every part of it is green, except the under wings, which are crimfon; and when fly? ing it has a beautiful appearance. The .eyes are very remarkable, thursday, july 6. T his morning at four o'clock weftruck our tents, and tracked brilkly till eight, when we refreihed, fet out again at ten, and continued tracking till lix in the evening, without any delay. We then fecurcd the boats, and pitched our tents on the Eaftern banks of the river. I tookTOWARDS ENGLAND. 73 I took an Arab with me and went a-lhooting about a mile from the river, where I found a great many partridges. This part of the country, excepting about fifty yards by the river fide, is a perfedt defert, though it appears to have been once cultivated, there being ftill the re mains of canals that have been cut to water the country, at diftances of about two hundred yards, on the banks of the river, and communicating with each other inland. In fome places banks have been made all round, to keep the water, as in paddy grounds. The river here runs fo rapidly that it has deepened its bed; the banks are ten feet perpendicular above the furface of the water, yet at that depth there is not the leaft variation in the colour of the foil. The furface of the earth at a diftance hrom the river is whitifh, having a mix ture of fait for about half a foot in depth; andI 74 a journey from india, and below that, a dark brown earth, the fame as on the banks of the river. At a great diftance to the eafhvard, we faw a long chain of lofty mountains rang ing N. W. and S. E. called the Curdiftan mountains. friday, july 7. W e fet out at four o'clock this morn ing; and at eight, by an E. N. E. courfe, entered the river T igris , called by the Arabs, S hat-el -A maar . Nearly oppo- iite, on the eaftcrn banks of the T igris, is a fmall town called C oote , off which leveral flout veffels were lying at anchor. The main body of the river runs S. S.

The T igris is here above a mile broad; and, though reckoned at its height, on account ot the fnow melting upon the mountains, the banks were upwards of ten feet perpendicular above the furface of the water. Several large droves of camels were grazing upon its banks. 'We found the river very crooked, wind ing from N. N. E. to South. At fix o'clock pa/Ted a Turkilh camp pitched on the weftern banks, and made our boats faft to the fame banks, about half a mile above them. The Turkilh tents had a very handfome appearance, fome being red, others green, and lome white. The army confilted oi lix thoufand horfe; and the Bafhaw had two armed veflels to at tend him on the river; thefe were about 150 tons burden each, and were built much like the Grabs in the E ast -I ndies, This76 a journey from india, This army had been fent to punifh fomc rebellious Arabs in this neighbourhood, who had murdered the Sheik of H illa, and feveral other officers under the Turkilh Government.

We were alfo told, that many of the Chiefs of the rebellious Arabs had efcaped by flight on the ap proach of the army, leaving behind them their flocks, which were feized by order(S op towards england. 77 of the Bafhaw, and driven to B agdad to be fold. We tracked till half paft fix ^'clock, and then pitched our tents on the weftern banks of the river. sunday, july 9.

E. we tracked till three o'clock, and flopped an hour to rc- fre/li; then tracked up the weflern banks till half paft fix. I took my gun, attended by an Arab, and went a-fhooting upwards of a mile from the banks of the river. I fliot feve- ral kinds of birds, particularly fomc very fine partridges, which were nearly of the foe of Englilh pheafants. It78 a journey from indiaj \. It did not appear that this part had ever been cultivated; nor did I perceive any figns of vegetation, except near the banks of the river, which are in general covered with a thick jungle of willows and Ihrubs. The Arabs are frequently obliged to cut a paffage through the jungle, for their flieep and cattle to get to the river; and the banks are in many places fo fteep, that they arc even obliged to cut them, and make a road to the w ater's edge. At the upper end of a fmall ifland, near the middle ot' the river, we faw the wreck of a large dow, hull under water. She was loll there three weeks before, and was worth ten lacks of rupees, having on board four lacks of Spanifh dollars, and other fpecie, and being loaded with cop per for B ussora . The owners have a guard to watch her, and purpofe weighing her when the river is at the loweft, which is ufually about Chriflmas. Though the river is here at leafi; two miles broad, two of the guards, who were Rationedtowards england. Rationed to watch the veUfcI, Iwam acrofs.

Thefe men having informed us, that we fliould be much more comfortable on the oppofite 1)a nks, where there was very little jungle, w e crolfed the river at nine o'clock. monday, july 10. Before we fet out this morning, we Uere ufited by fome Arabs from the lle ighbouring encampments, which ex- tc nded, to the right and left, as far as the ( y e could reach, having with them innu- Hieiable flocks of iheep and herds of cattle. AVe80 a JOURNEY FROM india, We were perfectly fafe among thefe people, unci our Sheik informed us, tliat y we becainc wholly out of danger as we approached nearer the feat of government. We fet out at fun-rife, and paflfed feveral droves of camels* grazing on the banks. The river ran very crooked till eleven o'clock, when we entered a long reach lying N.E. and S. W. the ftream very rapid, and about a mile and a halt broad. I had here an opportunity of obferving the progrefs of the hot winds, called by the natives Samiel, which fometimes pro\e very deftruclive, particularly at this fea- fon. They are mofl dangerous between twelve and three o'clock, when the at&gt; mofpherc is at its greateft degree of heat. Their force entirely depends on the fur- face over which they pafs. It it be over a defert, where there is no vegetation, they extend their dimenfions with amazing velocity, and then their progrefs is fome times to windward. If over grafs, or any other vegetation, they foon diminifh, and lofe much of their force. If over water, they(Sfc) towards england. 81 they lofe all their elciftncal fire, and afcend; yet I have fometimes felt their effects acrofs the river where it was at leait a mile broad. An inftance of this happened here. Mr. Stevens was bathing in the river, having on a pair of Turkifh drawers. On his return from the water, there came a hot wind acrofs the river, which made his drawers and himfelf per- fedly dry in an inftant. Had fuch a cir- cumftance been related to him by another perfon, he declared, he could not have believed it. I was prefent, and felt the iorce of the hot wind; but fhould other- wile have been as incredulous as Mr. Stevens. Captain R eid , who had often been my com pan ion ^ 11 Shooting (an amufement of H hich lie was equally fond as myfelf), having been unwell, I had been deprived his company for above a week pad; anc l he now became fo much overpowered b y ^ lc excefsive heat, as to be fcarcely able to walk. The heat being alfo too ini,dl ^ or our rowers, at noon we made G our82 a journey from india, our boats fafl to the eaftern banks of the river, where our people re (led under the ihade of fome willows for two hours. Going through the jungle to the edge of the Defert, I faw fome partridges at a little diflance, and was tempted to try if I could get a (hot; but having only my nippers on, I found great inconvenience from the excefsive heat of the Defert, and was glad to get back again to the river; for, though my feet were not bliftercd, yet the Ikin foon after peeled off the loles. Hitherto I had always worn a pair of ftrong boots, which I found extremely conve nient both with refpecft to the heat, and as a fafeguard from the reptiles and vene- mous infers, which in fomc places were very numerous; and I was particularly careful never to go out again fo lightly equipped. At two o'clock we refumed our voyage and continued tracking up the eaitern banks of the river till half pad fix.

Here were alio vifi- ble a great many earthen jars; fome half expofed, others ready to fall into the river; and fome of them were of lingular coil' ltru6tion. i The river here takes a circuit to the fouthward for about ten miles, and leases only a iVarrow neck of land, on which are ftill Handing many lofty walls and towers, being fragments of ancient C tesiphon.

This completely folves the problem, and fliews to what a length fu- perftition and prejudice is carried among them.

B agdad is feated on the eaflern banks of the T igris . It is a large and populous city, extending along the banks ot' the river about three miles; and the length of the walls from the river being about two miles, gives it the form of an oblong fquare. The houfes, though very inferior to the European, are much better built than thofe of B ussora , but nearly in the I' fame flile. Many of the public-buildings, fuch as mofqucs, minarets, and hummums, are conftrufted of hewn ftone, and make a 'Very handfome appearance. Here is alfo an extenfive Bazar, which is well fupplied with variety of articles; but the prices in general are much higher than at B ussora- The92 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, The Armenians are the principal mer chants here; the manufactories carried on are few, and thofe confined to articles for immediate life, as fhoes, boots, clothes, fadlery, and culinary utenfils. The Armenians at M osul fend great quantities of copper down the T igris to B agdad upon rafts of timber faftened to gether. On their arrival the rafts are fold, wood being very fcarce here. The copper is afterwards fhipped for B ussora on-board large dows, which are ufually about fix months in performing the voyage thither and back again. The copper is in fmall round cakes about fix inches broad, and nearly two inches thick in the middle, but gradually Hoping to the edges. It is of a quality nearly the fame as EngM battery cake copper.

Labour being much cheaper in thcfe countries than in Europe , they are enabled to carry it to a market at a much cheaper rate; and this makes it very pro fitable to thofe at prefent concerned in it. Though Bagdad is much better built than any other city in this part of the world, it is Hill very inferior to many cities in Europe . Every houfe wears the appearance of a prifon, as defcribed in Bussora , but compofed of better mate rials; they are in general of brick, and the timbers very good, being thofe which are floated down the Tigris. The flreets are very narrow and akifty. I had near half a mile to go every night to fleep, and ufually fet out about eleven o'clock, always taking a Turkifh fervant ^ith a lanthern, as it would have been very dangerous to walk at fuch a time Without a light.

Of the former I have frequently killed four or five in a night; they are of the large black kind, and their ftings often prove mortal. All perfons at this feafon of the year fleep on the tops of their houfes; and I have often been entertained by feeing the people run off with their clothes in their hands at fun-rife ; for as foon as it has rilen above the horizon it becomes excefsively hot. 1 foon learned, however, that even looking over our own parapet-wall was a deed of danger; for that the Turks would not hefitate a moment to fhoot at any per- fon whom they might difcover overlooking their houfes.

As he was pafsing near the Seraglio, he heard fome men crying out moft lamentably. On enquiry he was informed, that they were to receive two hundred lafhes each, a punifhment almoll equal to death. He defired the people to defift, as he could not bear to hear the men's fhrieks, (who by the bye had only received five or fix ftrokes on the foles of their feet) and he would intercede with the Bafhaw to mitigate their punilhment. On h is mentioning this affair to the Bafhaw, the latter replied, that for his ^ake he would not only releafe them, but Would fend them to his houfe, where they iuould be entirely at his difpofa). As foon as Mr. R enaud returned, he us the circumftance. About nine H 4* o'clock104? a journey from india, o'clock the fame evening, while we were at fupper on the top of the houfe, the two men, both Arabs, were brought up to us, ftill uncertain of their deftiny. Mr, R enaud , who fpeaks the Arabic as flu ently as Englifh, told them that he had prevailed with the Bafhaw to releafe them, and they were now at full liberty to go where they pleafed. It is impofsible to give the reader an adequate idea of the alteration in the poor men's countenances when they heard this. They fell on their knees, and prayed to G od and the Prophet to protect their deliverer. Captain R eid being now exceedingly ill, and there not being the leaft profped ot his recovery, my other companions being alfo unwell, I began to prepare for my departure; Mr. R enaud having ob tained my paflport, or fjrmaun, under the Bafhaw's feal, and having alio engaged a Tatar, named S iad A hmed A ga , to at tend me.towards england, 105 The Mookadar (or keeper of the feals) paid us a vifit, which was eonfidered as a very great honour. He gave directions to the Tatar in my prefence to be attentive to the prefervation of my perfon and pro perty, for that otherwise he fhould forfeit his head. I had now for tlie firft time an opportunity of obferving the ceremony of pertuming, &amp;;c. which is ufually paid to men of confequence. But the Mookadar was an exception to one very general cuf- tom amongll the. Turks, as he did not fmoke tobacco. On his taking leave he was complimented with an elegant white muflin turban and Cumberband, the artU cles moll commonly prefented on vilits of ceremony. My 1 atar drefs being ready, as well as the trappings of my horfe, I began to pre pare tor my departure from Bagdad. Though I was to travel under the title of Conful, yet it was neceflary to wear the Tatar drefs, to avoid being infulted by the populace, as is always the cafe when they difcover an European, whom they call 1 Fringui.105 a journey from india, . Fringui. I had alfo my head ihavcd, which I found to be of great ferviee, as it kept me cool, and was more convenient to me in wearing the Tatar drefs. I had entered into a written agreement with my Tatar to give him eight hundred piaflers; five hundred to be paid in ready money at B agdad before my departure, and the remaining three hundred on my fafe arrival at C onstantinople ; and lie engaged not to take any other paflengers or merchandize under his care. I took bills from B agdad on C onstantinople both for my Tatar's three hundred piafters, and the money I had provided for the re mainder of my journey. I had alfo let ters of credit on C onstantinople from Mr. M anesty , in cafe I fhould have oc- caiion for more money. My drefs confifted of a yellow cap about a foot high, broad at top and almoft flat, but becoming gradually narrower till it fitted the head. The lower part of the cap was covered all round with black lambfkin 5 abouttowards england. 107 about four inches deep, the infide lined and quilted, and in the upper part fluffed with wool extremely tight. Being thus calculated to refill; any weapon, it is an excellent fafeguard to the head. This cap, which being very heavy, feels un- pleafantly at firft, is called a Culpack, and is only worn by the Tatars. My other ar ticles of apparel were, a brown cloth coat trimmed with a broad black filk binding, wrapping quite round the body with fhort wide fleeves, and hanging down to the calt ot the leg; blue Turkifh trowfers trimmed with black filk binding, made very wide, but buttoning tight round the ftnall ol the leg; and ftrong red boots to pull over the trowfers as high as the calf of the leg. The under-drefs is a Turkifh gown, with long lleeves buttoning clofe round the wrill; and a fhirt without a collar. Turks of all defcriptions have the neck entirely bare. The Tatars wear drawers; but I wore a pair of Itrong leather breeches under my trowfers, which [found ol very great fcrvice. A cumberband about108 a journey from india, about fix yards long was tied very tightly round my waift, and in this I hung a brace of piftols, befide having a large Turkifh fabre fartened round my middle with a belt. My European clothes, and whatever I had not immediate occafion ioi, I had packed up in wax cloth; fhirts, dockings, and other neceflaries that I fhould have occafion for on the journey, I had put into a leather-pouch, which was faftened behind the faddle. THURSDAY, JULY 20. B eing with my Tatar completely equipped, at five o'clock our horfes were brought, and I took leave of my compa nions. Captain R eid was reduced almoll to a fhadow by the excefsive heat ot the climate: he had been my companion in many agreeable excurfions, and I could fearcely refrain from tears on thus taking leave of him, without the fmalleft hope of ever feeing him again, AVeTOWARDS ENGLAND. 109 We rode near a mile through the Bazar, where the merchants, having been ap prized when I (hould go, were waiting with their letters. My Tatar took, I am fure, upwards of two hundred under his charge, this being the only method they have of forwarding letters from one city to another. The merchants and Tatars are, therefore, always upon very good terms; and the office of Tatar, as it is of the greated trull, is alfo very profitable; for, befide their other emoluments, they receive confidcrable prefents from the mer chants. The letters are not any great in convenience to them, giving no farther trouble than the mere carriage; for when a Tatar -arrives at any confiderable city, the merchants immediately go to theConac for their letters. Near the weftern gate of the city a caravan was preparing to fet out, feveral hundred camels being already loaded. As foon as we were without the gates we fet off at a bj;ilk trot, the firft part of our110 a journey from india, our road being a perfect defert, without the leall appearance of vegetation. Having ridden about four miles, we overtook the Tatar's fervant with three horfes, the one on which he rode had my European clothes, a few necelfaries belonging to the Tatar, and a couple of leathern bottles with water. The fecond horfe had only a cloth on him and a bridle; being brought as a referve, in cafe of any accident hap pening to the other horfes. The third was laden with two bales of merchandize, a thing exprefly againft our agreement. I had actually deprived myfelf of many ne- cefTaries that I might not be encumbered; and now finding that my Tatar had de ceived me, 1 thought of returning to B agdad , and charging him with his breach of contrail. Reproaching him for his conduct, I threatened to return, which alarmed him very much., as fuch a ftep would in all probability have ruined him. He folemnly aflfured me, that he fhould only take them to M osul. Thouditowards england. l-fl Though much difconcerted by this con- diuft in my Tatar, yet having already paid him five hundred piafters, I thought it better to proceed, even though I might be detained a few days. The Tatar then pro- mifing to make as much hafte as pofsible, we continued our journey, and about nine miles from Bagdad arrived at the banks of a branch of the Tigris . The road was here very rough, and full of fhmtcd ^irubs. AVe foon lett the river, and at ten o'clock palled through the town of ^ aiskja . In the vicinity were feveral flocks of fliecp, watched by fhepherds for lear ot the jackalls, which were very nu merous, and made a moil hideous noife. On crofsing a plain weftward of Y ankja, though between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I felt much inconvenience from a tat and fulphurcous wind. I tied a hand kerchief over my mouth and nofe till it palled us, and my Tatar did the fame; ^ut I began to apprehend fome danger.

We now rode at the rate of five miles an hour, croffed the river D eaal over altonc bridge which had two very loity ftonc pillars at one end, and at hall paft nine o'clock arrived at a village called Cm- buccan , where we flept on the bait ground in the open air. saturdav,'TOWARDS ENGLAND. 115 saturday, july 22. A t halt paft one o'clock, as tve were demounting, a large party of Arabs on horfeback entered the village. We pur- fued our journey at the rate of four miles an hour, and at four o'clock again cro/Ied the river D eaal over a ftone bridge at a village called D eaal-abbas . Before day break we met feveral parties of Arabs on hodeback between C hubuccan and this place; but they did not molefl us, and we very feldom flopped to fpeak to them, only giving the cuftomary falutation as we palled. Here 1 procured bread and new flnilk, on which I made a very comfortable breaklaft. We mounted again at half paft four, and, turning due Eaft, palled through a well cultivated country along the banks of the river D eaal till fix o'clock, when we arrived at A danaque. This town is fituated at the foot of a ; ange of mountains, running Eaft and I 2 Weft.115 a JOURNEY FROM INDIA, Weft, and is well watered by feme clear rivulets that run from the mountains. Though here is plenty of Hone, yet all the houfes are built with clay, and are only one ftory high. In this place cranes are fo abundant, that there is fcarcely a houfe which has not fcvcral nefts upon it. They are very tame, and the inhabitants never moleft them. When any thing difturbs thefe birds, they make a violent clatter with their long beaks, which is fometimes repeated by the others all over the town; and this noife will fometimes continue for feveral minutes. It is as loud as a watch man's rattle, and not much unlike it in found. From A danaque we fet out on frelli horfes at half pall four o'clock, and al- cended the mountains by very narrow palles. Some were cut through the folid rock, giving room only for one horfe to pafs at a time.' On the top of one of thefc mountains fomc Arabs were encamped who exacted a few piafters from my Tatar. There were indeed only half a dozen ol them,towards england. 117 them, but they were all well armed; and I obferved them getting their matchlocks ready, in cafe my Tatar had refufed to comply with their demands. It requires fome time tor a man to prepare a match lock, as he has to ftrike a light. They are very certain at a fteady mark, but other- wife cannot be depended upon. They arc chiefly rifle-barrels, and the Arabs are near a quarter of an hour in charging them. After crofsing thefe mountains wc en tered an extenlive vale, through which a confiderable river runs from Weft to Eaft, called by the natives S hat-el- N arin, There were feveral Arabs with their flocks on the banks of the river, which we crolled at fun-fet. Though a confiderable body of water, it is a fine clpar fiream; but has no bridge over it near this place. About the banks of this river were fe veral very curious animals, a fpecies of the Jerboa as defcribed by B uffon . They burrow like rabbits, fecm very tame, and run very faft upon their hind legs.

One of the fervants rode up to whip my horfe; but, being as well mounted as any of the party, I thought myfelf able to ride as well as they. It alfo appeared to me fomewhat difgraceful to fuffer my horfe to be whipped by another perfon; and on one of the lervants Itriking my bead, I turned round and lafhed him. This was a broad hint, to be fure; but it had the defired effe6l; for they never offered to whip my horfe afterwards. Travelling flill on full gallop, we pafTed more ot thofe encampments where the Arabs are ftationed to exact money. As the night was very dark, no moon being, vifible, and the roads exceedingly rough, there was fcarcely a horfe among the party but had one or more falls, though thofe cattle are in general very fure-footed. We arrived at K uppree at half pad two o'clock, after crofsing the river N akin over a Hone bridge. At120 a journey from india, At four o'clock we fet out again on frefh horfes, and palled over a very barren country, not meeting with a Tingle habi tation. We continued along the bafcs of a chain of hills on our right, running Eaft and Weli, and, though galloping all the way, met with no accident, the road being in general very good. Some of our horfes, however, were fo much tired, that we were obliged to leave them behind, and mount the led horfes which are al- ways kept in referve.

Thefe, however, the fliepherds are always obliged to drive to the town in the evening, on account of the wild beads. Though we had a view over this vale for near fifteen or twenty miles, I could not difcovcr a Tingle habitation. Our fare at the Conacs was tolerable, and the people were very attentive. In deed, it any ot the fervants, or even the mailers ot the Conacs, had neglected their duty, my Tatar would not have failed to give them a good horfe-whipping. Iheir mutton is very fine, as is their poultry alfo. Their kids too are very good; but they drefs their victuals too much for an Englifhman, and eat extravagantly of the fat. Their bread is mofllv in thin J • cakes, and tolerably good. My diet here was chiefly bread and milk. At four o'clock in the afternoon we left 1 uscomartee ; and, galloping the whole of122 a journey from india, of the way over a barren country, arrived at half paft fix at a town called T aook. T aook is fituated on the North of the fame extenfive vale, which is about twenty jniles over, and has a chain of mountains on each fide, running Eaft and Weft. We fet out from T aook at halt paft eight o'clock, and, after riding about lour miles, arrived at a town called T epellee in the fame vale, watered by~ feveral llreams flowing trom the mountains on the North. We did not flop at T epellee, but continued our journey, riding at about four miles an hour, the roads being very rough, and fometimes intricate. In the nights, which were now very dark, I could not but think that going full gallop over fuch rough ground mult be attended with fome danger; and I there' fore checked my Tatar; but while the day-light continued permitted him to go as faft as he chofe. Thei towards england. 125 The Tatars are excellent riders, being the greater part of their time on horfe- baek; they have not, however, the leaft regard for the hearts, but gallop up hill or down without diftinclion, and keep on till fometimes the horfes fall under the fatigue, unable to go any farther. Neverthelefs, thefe horfes are much more hardy and able to endure fatigue, than thofe of Eu rope . The riders do not feem to be much afraid of a fall, which often happens in galloping down hill; for the»cap preferves the head, the cumberband the body, and the ftrong boots the legs; and the foot is very eafily difengagcd from the ftirrups, which are iron-plates, nearly as long as the foot. monday, july W e continued riding moderately till two o'clock, when we arrived at Kir- cook , alfo fituated in the vale before- n^entioucd, - We124 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, We fet out again on frcfh horfes at three o'clock, and foon after afcended the chain of mountains on our right. Near the fummit we found feveral Naphtha pits. Thefe are dug out of the rock, are about three feet deep, and into them the Naphtha oozes in a thick liquid, having a very ftrong fmell, nearly refembling that ot our coal- tar. Juft above thefe pits were feveral rocks of fait. We foon after found ourfelves among fome hills ihaped like hay-cocks, which appear to have been fo formed by water, being covered with pebbles and ihells, like thofe ufually feen on the fides of rivers. Toward the top of this chain of moun tains, thefe round hills were very large; but they gradually diminifhed for about two miles, when we defcended into an exten- five vale. This was to us a great relief; for it was moft unpleafant travelling among thole 5 hill?)TOWARDS ENGLAND. 123 hills, being obliged to make a zigzag courfe, and finding them in fome places fo extremely deep, that it was with diffi culty our horfes could keep their feet, the roundifh pebbles giving way under their tread. / Some of thofe hills towards the bottom were not much larger than a good- fized hay-cock; and feen from the vale below they had a very lingular appear ance, extending from Eafl to Weft, as far the eye could reach. Th is immenfe range of mountains ap pears as if it had once formed a barrier. Along the top are the remains of a very ftrong wall, built with ftone and cemented with bitumen. Soon after we had defcendcd into the vale, we puftied on, in a gallop the greater part of the way, to Alton Kuppree, where we arrived at half pall feven o'clock. This is a large and populous town, built on an ifland formed by the river Alton, dividingM 12&lt;S A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, dividing itfclf clofe above the town, and uniting again a little below it, the town nearly covering the whole illand. Here is at prefent a very large garrifon of Turk- ilh foldiers; and the town may be deemed impregnable, being difficult of aecefs, and the life of artillery not known in this country. On entering the town we croffed the river, over which is a /tone bridge of one arch, the highefi: I ever faw. The palTage over this bridge is very difagreeable, it being exceedingly lleep on both fides, and like a Gothic arch running up to a point in the center. The pavement upon the bridge too is very bad, and my horfe had feveral falls before J got over it. This town is at prefent the capital of Turkifh Curdistan , and a Bafhaw refides in it. We fet out again at five o'clock in the afternoon, and on leaving the town eroded the other branch of the river, over which is a bridge of two arches. This river con tainstowards england. 127 tains a large body of water, and falls into the T igris , a few miles below the town. Soon after we left A lton K uppree, we entered a very fine and well cultivated country, fertile in corn and garden vege tables, the former being then about to be cut. A journey of about fix miles brought us again among hills, with very little cul tivation; nor did we fee much fertility till we arrived near E vrill , which is thirty- two miles from A lton K uppree. E vrill appears to have been formerly a place of fome importance, for it exhibits the remains of an old callle on the top of an artificial hill on the Weft fide of the town, and in the vicinity arcfevcral Naph tha pits. It is faid to be the ancient A rbe- la , near which A lexander fought with D arius , and the country for fome diftancc round it is an open champaign. We did not change horfes here, but continued our journey four miles farther, and at eleven o'clock arrived at a town called A nkava. F op128 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, For the greateft part of this flage the road was very good. TUESDAY, JULY 25. T his morning we fet out from A nkava at half pad one, and, riding very faft, at five reached a fmall town ealled K illick, on the banks of the river Z arp . Here was a caravan waiting to crofs the river, a paflage that muft take up a confiderable time, being without boats. The horfes and camels fwim acrofs, three or four at a time, being led by a man who fwims buoyed up by a goat's fkin inflated with wind, which he keeps under his breaft. 1 he merchandize and paffengers are car ried over on a platform, which is fupported by the fame kind of fkins blown up in proportion to the weight they have to carry. We crofled over in this manner, and were not detained long, the conduc tors ot the caravan giving us, as grangers, the preference. Tli«towards england. 129 The Z arp is a very large and perfe6lly clear river, flowing from fome very high mountains to the northward, capped with fnow. The country near the river appears to be very fertile, and produces great quan tities ot corn, which the inhabitants were employed in cutting. Having crolled the Z arp, we were foon re-mounted, and after riding about fix miles through a fer tile country, arrived at another connder- able river called the H azir, which flows from near the fame fource. This is not fo large as the Z arp, but as there were no conveyances, it was with fome difficulty We were enabled to ford it, being now un- ufually high on account of the fnow melt ing trom the mountains. We rode very fafi; over a fine champaign for about fix miles further, -and at eight o 'clock arrived at a town called K ara- koosh. Horfes not being ready, we had to wait ^n hour, though I was very anxious to get to M osul this morning, as I thought it K would130 a journey from india, would gain me a day. Horfes were brought a little after nine o'clock; but the fun was now become excefsively hot, the inhabitants began to retire into the ihadc, and fome of them down into deep vaults. This part of the country is reckoned the mod dangerous at this feafon, on account of the Samuel winds, which are now at their greateft ftrength, and more people are deftroyed by them than in any other way. Both my Tatar and myfelf being exceedingly well mounted, we fet out at full fpeed, and continued that pace mofi; part of the way, which is near twenty miles; for the Samiel winds were beginning to rife before we could reach Mosul , and they would have gained itrength fo fail, that I have no doubt if we had been an hour later, expofed as we were, the whole party, men and horfes, would have been laid dead on the groundr We reached Mosul at a quarter before eleven o'clock, after crofsing the T igris over a bridge of boats.

M osul, which is faid by fome of the inhabitants to be the ancient N ineveh, is pleafantly fituated on a declivity upon the right banks of the T igris. What it may formerly have been I cannot fay^ but it is now a very large town, and contains many handfome buildings, exclulive of the hum- mums, mofques, and minarets, which are all built of hewn Hone. Here is not fo much referve of manners as in the cities to the eafhvard, women of ail defcriptions being nearly as much ex- pofed as in E urope. The town is very populous, and comprifes men of various religions; but the great bulk of the inha bitants are Curds, or, as the Arafis call them, Kurks. I took a guide and went over moll: part of the town. The Bazar is large and well Supplied; and mofl of the articles, except K 2 clothing.132 A JOUHNEY FROM INDIA, clothing, are very moderate. The people appeared much more induftrious than any I had feen before (ince I left India. Va rious manufactories are carried on, and in fome they excel the Europeans. Their faddles and trappings for horfcs, in parti cular, are very elegant. They alfo make carpets of filk, with flowers worked in them, which feem to vie with the heft of our manufactures. They are alfo very dexterous in making edgings and trim mings of various kinds, both for men and women. Their manufactories in copper and iron too are verv numerous; and a •&gt; great variety of articles made of thofe metals are fent down the Tigris as low as B ussora , exclufive of the immenle quan tity of metal fent down unmanufactured; for they get the ore in abundance from the r mountains to the nortliward. The town of M osul is furrounded by a ilrong lofty wall built with hewn ftonc. The fpace within the wall is not entirely occupied by houfes, many places being coveredm i towards england. 133 covered with ruins, wbicli proves that it has once been much more populous than at prefent. Dire611y oppolite the Conac where I Hopped was the Court of Juftice. The / trials here are very Ihort; ibr in lefs than five minutes after the prifoner is taken be fore the court, if he be found guilty, he is conveyed to receive his puniihment. The Court of Juftice is opened at fun-rife; but it does not continue above two hours, for, as the reader will perceive, they have a method of difpatching bufinefs very quickly, I met here a Venetian Padre named M oneur, with whom I converfed in Latin, which he fpoke very fluently. He had re cently received letters from C onstanti nople, giving an account of the French having invaded his country, at which he fcemcd much concerned. He was a very intelligent plcafant man, and much more learned than many of the fraternity. He had his mifsion from the Pope, had K 3 been134- a journey from india, been at M osul two years and eight months, and intended going to I ndia very foon. There was not a perfon in the whole town that underftood either French or Englifh. I here found that I could not proceed | by the ufual route, on account of the then turbulent ftate of the country. The inhabitants of J es seer a were in open re bellion againft the Turkifh government, had killed the Bafhaw, and committed many other excefles. I was alfo told, that it was very dangerous to go even a few miles from M osul without a ftrong guard. In confequence of this information, my ■ Tatar waited on the Bafliaw with the lirmaun, who immediately ordered a guard of an officer and iixteen horfemcn, wednesday, july 2(). At four o'clock in the afternoon we were informed that our guards and fer- vants were ready. We mounted, and found 1TOWARDS ENGLAND. 135 found them waiting for us at the weftem gate. I I had now the mortification to find my Tatar again breaking his promife by taking the merchandize further. Though I had not hitherto been much detained by it, I thought that it might be a temptation to the numerous hordes of banditti that infeft this country; but as I had no alternative, I was forced to fubmit to this grofs impo- fition. The bodes belonging to the whole party were exceedingly good, and this was pcrfcdly neccflary, as we had to travel upwards of a hundred and fifty miles be fore we could obtain frefh ones. The of ficer's horfe was a beautiful white Arabian, exceedingly fwift. Soon after we had left the town, many of the horfemen, to give their bealts a breathing, exercifed with their fpears, which to me was one of the fineft fights I bad ever beheld. The officer wore a fcarlet gown and cameline; his cap was near two feet high, and fhaped like the crown of a n K 4 hat;13(5 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, hat; his beard was long and black; and he was about thirty years of age. The Yoldiers were drelfed in white, with fcarlet caps and turbans, and only wore muf- taches. The unfettled ftate of the country com pelled us to travel up the right banks of the T igris . We rode moderately at about four miles an hour, and at feven o'clock arrived at a fmall village on the banks ot the river, where we refrefhed. The coun try through which we had paflfed irom M osul to this village is very well culti vated, producing great quantities of corn; and nearly the whole of the way we favv ruins on both fides of the river, fome at a confiderable diftance, and others clofe on the banks. This village is fituatcd on the Cj top of an almoll perpendicular cliff, about a hundred and fifty yards above the river. We fet out again at eight o'clock, our guard now amounting to twenty horfemen. The road foon became very hilly and rugged; but after we had got through fonietowards england. 137 fome very ftcep and narrow paflfes, where only one horfe could go at a time, we again came to the banks of the T igris. The night was dark, and the road fo very bad, that it was with much difficulty we could make any progrefs. We now turned to the fouthward, leaving the T igris on our right, and joined a large caravan goincr to D iarbekir . It confifted of about two i thoufand camels, three thoufand afles and mules, and one thoufand horfes; the whole being conduced by an Arab Sheik, with a confiderable number of guards. thursday, july 27. S oon after we had come up with the caravan, which was about one o'clock in the morning, feveral Tatars going to D i arbekir joined our party; for, though equipped to travel much farter than a ca ravan, they were afraid to pulh forward. There are no fixed refidences in this coun try, and it is at prefent much infefted by wandering hordes of banditti. When the TatarsI 4 138 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, Tatars had joined our party it amounted to forty horfe. We now rode fafter than the caravan, which formed a continued line of full fix miles, and came up with the head of it at five o'clock. We then flopped by the fide of a fmall rivulet on an extenfive plain. Here alfo the caravan flopped, unloading their hearts of burden, and pitching their tents as they came up. My Tatar not having provided proper accommodations, I was obliged to lie down on the bare earth with all my clothes on. I flept, however, till feven o'clock, when the fun became very hot, I then went into the Arab Sheik's tent, and breakfafted with him. Near this rivulet is a lofty mound ot earth, which commands an extenfive prol- pect over the plain. On the top of this mound the Sheik kept a watch the whole day, to prevent a furprize. Of thofe lolly mounds of earth there are many ih this country, and they are no doubt artificial, as they always ft and fingly on extenfive plains,TOWARDS ENGLAND. 139 plains. They 'muft, liowever, have coll much labour, fome of them being ex tremely large. I here caught fome locufts of an extra ordinary fize, and very thick in proportion to their length. They have no wings, move flowly, and are eafily taken. I foon found it neceliary to be careful that they did not bite me, for I am perfuaded that they could eafily have bitten my finger to the bone. I tried one with a twig about as thick as a quill, which it bit through in- flantly. I then differed one, and on ex amining one of its grinders found it nearly as large as a human tooth, and fo hard, that I was not able to make any imprefsion on it with my penknife. The grinders were nearly the colour of mahogany. Finding that we were not molefted by flies or other infects, and afcribing this circumftance to the excefsive beat of the hin at this feafon, I made an experiment on one of thefe large locufts, by expofing it to the fun, which actually killed it in Id*14-0 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, lefs than an hour. I alfo found that flies, when expofed in the middle of the day, fell down almoft inftantly; and that all kinds of infers muft either get into fome fhade, or inevitably perilh. The Sheik was under fome apprehenfions that he fhould be attacked, and took, of courfe, every neceffary precaution. He kept about fifty horfemen ready to mount in a moment, and fent others eight or ten miles round as a patrole. It was near this place that the Tatar whom I have men tioned before * was murdered, and this circumftance was fiill frefh in the minds of the people. It muft, however, have required a very confiderable force to have cut off this caravan, there being nearly as many men as beafts of burden, and every one armed with fome fort o£ weapon. The greateft part had long fpears, and though thefe might not appear very for midable againft regular European troops, they are perfectly well adapted to the * Page 35.. TOWARDS ENGLAND. 141 prefent mode of fighting in this country. Some of the people had bows and arrows, and, indeed, one of the Tatars was armed with them. This man was very dexterous in Ihooting; when on horfeback, he car ried his bow and quiver flung over his fhoulder, and appeared capable of doing more execution than the fpear-men. The ground whereon we were en camped was covered with long dried grafs and tobacco leaves, both quite brown and withered; for no green thing appears here, except in the immediate vicinity of water. Some of the people belonging to the caravan fet the grafs on fire to leeward of the encampment, which fpread very ra pidly, and quickly confumed its fuel. At half pafi: five o'clock we fet out with this immenfe caravan, which required two hours to be put in motion; and our M osul guard now returned. friday,I 142 a journey from INDIA, friday, july 28. W e continued in company with the caravan till three o'clock this morning, travelling at the rate of only three miles an hour. The foremoft perfons of the caravan then began to pitch their tents by the fide of a rivulet. Being joined by the D iarbekir Tatars and five Arabs, which made our party amount to twenty horfe, we now left the caravan, and pufhed forward, at the rate ot fix miles an hour, over an open defert country, in which not a habitation nor any fpecies of cultivation were to be feen. At fun-rife we came to fome rivulets, whole banks were covered with grafs and rufhes, growing very thick and long. Among thefe were feveral wild hogs, which rulhed out to the neighbouring plain as we approached. I faw one drove ot about twenty running towards a rivulet,TOWARDS ENGLAND. 143 rivulet, as if they intended to crofs us ; and all the noife the whole party could make was not fufficient to turn them. Beino- exceedingly well mounted, I purfued them at full fpeed, having with me two Arabs armed with their long fpears. We overtook them at the rivulet, when the whole herd rufhed through, and ran acrofs the plain, except one, which attempted to hide him- felf among the rufhes. The Arabs with their fpears foon found him out. He at tempted to run acrofs the plain after the others, but we purfued clofely, and turned him. I foon found that the Arabs were more dextrous than myfelf, for they had fpeared him before I was able to get a cut at him with my fabre. After he had been wounded two or three times, he became exceedingly furious, and ran at our horfes, while we endeavoured to keep him off with our weapons. The Arabs had the advan tage with their long fpears, as 1 could not cut him with my fabre till I was very near him. Through my inattention and want experience, lie at one time actually touched my horfe with his tufks, and I was144 a JOURNEY FROM india, was very near being difmounted. Such an accident might have proved fatal, as the hog would foon have dellroyed me while on the ground. He alfo touched one of the Arabs horfes, but did not greatly injure either, the horfes being very quick in their motions. He foamed at the mouth, and fnatched at the fpears, or any thing that came near him. While he had ftrength we were all afraid to clofe upon him, and only wounded him as he run at us. He foon, however, became weak through lofs of blood, and we then clofed upon him, fpearing and cutting till at laft he fell. I did not obferve that he made the leaft noife either during the chace or while we were killing him. He was rather under the middling fize, and his colour was a deep red. The rell; of the party did not interfere, but remained quiet fpe6lators, and were highly entertained. To me it was one of the greateft treats that could pofsibly have happened, as I had never witnefled any thing of the kind before. I had frequently fecn6o) TOWARDS ENGLAND. 145 feen wild hogs, and had wiihed much to attack them, but was afraid to do it alone, and am now fully convinced how impru dent it would have been. They defend themfelves much longer than I could have imagined, and when irritated no animal can be more furious. We left the hos: dead upon the ground, and foon after wards law a very large brown wolf. We again continued our route at the rate of fix miles an hour, till half pad eight o'clock, when we arrived at one of thofe artificial hills fituated on an extenfive plain by a pleafant rivulet of clear water. There is no fixed refidcnce to be feen near this place, and the tents are only tempo rary, to accommodate travellers who are obliged to pafs through this unfrequented route on account of the prcfent difturbed ftate of the country. We flept in a tent pitched by the fide of the rivulet, and I was fortunate in getting a little bread and milk. I bathed in the rivulet, and found it very refreshing. L I alfo145 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, I alfo felt much cafe and comfort from having my head fhaved, and always walhed my head in cold water whenever I had an opportunity. At five o'clock in the afternoon we again mounted our horfes; and after travelling ten miles nearly due Weft, over an open country which appears to have been once inhabited and cultivated, though now en tirely forfaken, we came to fome fine ftreams of water, on the banks of one of which are the ruins of a city, which ap pears to have been once very extenlive, and nearly in the (hapo of a half moon. Here were many hewn ftones of very large dimenfions; and among the ruins I faw a ftone coffin, with the lower part entire, but could not difcover any infeription either on the ftones or on the coffin. About this unfrequented place no living creatures are to be feen, except wild hogs, a few wolves, and fome eagles, the latter very tame. The ftreams, however, abounded with fifh. Wetowards england. Ut We continued our route nearly due Weft till nine o'clock, when, having croffed a rivulet, we turned to the north ward. One of our party about this time loll his way, but on his firing a piftol, we were enabled to find him. The night being ^ery dark, and there being no road or path to follow, it was fometimes with the utmoft difficulty that we could proceed. At midnight we reached a fmall place called 1 hies , which contained merely a tew houfes built on one of thofe artificial lulls ot which I have before made men tion. We refted here half an hour; for I was now almoll exhaufted with hunger ^nd fatigue. saturday, july 29. W e fet out again from T hi E s at half paft twelve o'clock, without having been able to procure any refrefhment. Soon a tter our quitting the place we loft our Wa y, it being extremely dark, and got L 2 into148 A journey from india, into fome fwampy ground, from wbich it was near an hour before we could extricate ourfelves. We then croffed feveral rtreams that flow from a chain of mountains to the northward, and rode brifkly till three o'clock, when we arrived at N is sib in. I congratulated myfelf on again enter ing an inhabited country, with marks of cultivation, which I had not feen fince I quitted the neighbourhood of M osul. Our Arab guides now left us; but we were ftili fifteen in number, and for a party fo large we were not able to pro cure a fufficient number of horfes before /even o'clock. N issibin is at prefent a fmall and mi* ferable place; but the many circumjacent ruins imply that it has once been ot more confequence. i We had now got into the common road; but moil of the party being badly mounted, we were obliged to travel llowly. ^ ie funtowards england. 149 fun becoming exceedingly hot, I wifhed much to get to M ardin as foon as pof- fible. About fix miles weft ward from N issibin are fome magnificent ruins of an ancient palace, which appears to have been very lofty, fome parts of the building being ftill of a great height. I had the curiofity to ride into the inner fquare, where I found fome Curds drawing water from a well in the centre about forty yards deep. The water was very cold and exceedingly clear. The walls of the building are of aftonifhing thicknefs; a (tone llaircafe re mains almoft entire; and lome parts ol the walls, which have been undermined, are fo ftrongly cemented, that in their ta ]l they ftill adhere together. We now pafled through a finely culti vated country, a chain oi lotty mountains on our right ranging Eaft and eft, having their fides covered with fir-trees. About150 a journey from india, About twelve miles weftward of the firft ruins is another heap, among which a very lofty arch remains entire. Near thefe ruins, and a little out of the road towards the mountains, were fome young Curd women milking their goats. I took my Tatar with me, and procured fome milk. The features of thefe women were much handfomer than thofe of the Arabs, and they are nearly as fair as the women in E ngland. Being now again expofed in the middle of the day, I fuifered much from the ex- cefsive heat of the fun. The hot winds too began to colled:; but before they had acquired ftrength enough to be dangerous, we paffed the village called A rin , and afcended the fide of the mountain towards M ardin , when I happily found myfelt out of their reach, as they never prevail in elevated fituations; and I have Ire- quently obferved, that whenever they fhape their courfe towards a mountain, {.hey foon fubfide.

Though there is much cultivation and fome fine palture in the vale below, the people are obliged to drive their lk»cks towards the mountains, whenever and fo long as thofe winds prevail. The afccnt was by a bad road, and our progrefs fo very flow, that it was three o'clock in the afternoon before we arrived at M ardin , and our horfes were com pletely tired. M ardin , Htuated at the top of a very ^ofty and rugged mountain, is a city of confidcrable hze, and very populous. The greater part of the inhabitants are Arme- L 4* nianSj15^ A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, mans,.,who are very induftrious, and carry pfi feveral matiufadories. The city is fur- rourlded by a ftrong and lofty wall built with, hewn ftone; and on the fummit of the mountain is a llrong fort, on which a few cannon are mounted, The city is built on the fouth fide of the mountain, at a part where it is extremely fteep. The houfes are much better built than any that I had feen fmce I left I n dia ., The ftreets run Eaft and Wert, and have fteps communicating from one to an other. The bafes of the houfes in the upper ftreet arc even with the tops of the houfes in the ilreet beiow. Hie city is very well fupplied with water, and of gpcd quality, -v- r. if- - Ti^e inhabitants, who feem to be a hofr pitable well-dilpofed people, enjoy a pure air, have as fair complexions as the people in E ngland , and in general appear ruddy and healthy. Many of the women are very beautiful, and expofe their perfous pearly as much as the ladies in E urope. 2 Provifions,TOWARDS ENGLAND. Provlfions, and vegetables in particular, are plentiful, good, and cheap; they have alfo moft kinds of fruits, and of the fineft quality, the climate .being exceedingly hot in the valleys, and temperate on the mountains. I found here a mifsionary from R ome, with whom I converfed in Latin. He was an intelligent pleafant man, and informed me of many occurrences in E urope , of which I had not before heard. The mif- fionaries correlpond with each other all over the Empire, and are fpeedily ac quainted with every material tranla^tion both here and in E urope. The Turks are of a difpofition precifely the reverfe, and appear perfectly indit- ferent to every thing that does not imme diately concern them. This city, by Its fituation, may be faid to be impregnable; and fome hiflorians affirm, that T amerlane laid fiege to it for154- A jbtJRNEY FROM INDIA, for three years, without being able to rc- duce it» Finding that it would be dangerous tra velling to D iarbekir without protedlion, my Tatar waited on the Bafhaw with the firmaun, who immediately gave orders for a ^uard.

W e left M ardin this morning at eight o'clock, accompanied by one of the D i arbekir Tatars and his attendants, and defcended the north fide of the mountain on which the city is built; of which, though very fleep and rocky, every little patch of ground capable of cultivation bore proofs of the induftry of the Arme nians, in abundance of grapes, apples, pears, plumbs of various forts, cucumbers, melons, and almoft all kinds of European fruits and vegetables, After \towards england. 155 After we had crofled this lofty chain of mountains, we reached an ex ten five range of round hills, the bottoms of which were cultivated wherever there was water. The Curd women here labour in the fields jis well as the men, and refemble much the peafantry of E ngland . Among thefe hills we continued travelling for near twenty miles, when they gradually dimi- nifhed as we defcended, and cultivation re-appeared. Some people were fowing, and others reaping. They have cattle and horfes in abundance, very few iheep, but a great number of goats, which feem bet ter adapted to the fituation. The hills in general were thickly planted with trees, and we did not get clear of them till half pad two o'clock, when we arrived at the place where we were to receive our guard for D iarbekir. We found here a great number of fmall ftieds made of the branches of trees, having their door-ways toward the North. r l he people live in thefe in preference to houfes gt this feafon of the year, and they were very156 a journey from india, very full of inhabitants, who appeared to be all diligently employed. The women drefs differently from both the Arabs and.l urks. They wear a cap like that of a Huffar, ,feven or eight inches deep, covered with a white cloth, and bound with a fhawl or handkerchief round the forehead. Part of the white cloth protects the neck from the fun; but the face below the forehead is entirely expofed. Over their under drefs, they wear a loofe gown with fhort wide fleeves, tied round the waiil by a falh. I hey wear no llockings, but have yellow 1 urkilh flippers. They fpin with a rock and fpindle, and I have feen fome of them weaving. I be lieve them to be as happy people as exift in the world, and, indeed, content ap pears in every countenance. We dined in one of thefe houfes, or rather ftieds, with fome Turkifli officers, among whom was the commandant o^ a partytowards england. 157 a party ftationed here, to whom my Tatar prefented the Bafhaw's order for a guard. Though I have called it dining, the fa&lt;5l is, that I could not eat their victuals, every difli being rendered fo very fat and greafy. Fortunately, however, I prevailed on one of the women to go and milk a goat for me, and made a comfort able meal of milk and bread. It was eight o'clock in the evening be fore we fet out, being obliged to continue on our M ardin horfes. After we had pafied over this uniform range of hills, we had ftill to travel through fome lleep pafl'es, among which, about ten o'clock, it being then very dark, a laughable circumftance occurred. The commander of our guard, who appeared to be a man of courage, law a beafl moving at a little difiance. As we were far from any habitation, the whole party thought that it was a lion, and the fize and colour of the animal fa voured the deception. The officer muf- tered his troops, moft of them being ex ceedingly well mounted, and armed with long15S a journey from india, long fpears, and rode toward the fuppofed lion in a body; nor was it till they were almoll near enough to fpear him, that they were undeceived, by difcovering that it was a hog. On enquiry I found that among thefe hills lions are very numerous, and deftroy many of the flocks belonging to the in- duftrious inhabitants. At eleven o'clock we forded a river, on whofe banks were a great many tents be longing to numerous gangs of banditti who infeft this part of the country. As foon as we had pafifed them, our guard, expc6Hng that they would follow us, halted for a quarter of an hour, while we conti nued our route. The robbers, having ob- fervecr the troops, did not make any at tempt, and our guards foon overtook us. At twelve o'clock we forded the river T igris.

CO) monday, july 3k A fter we had forded the T igris, which was here very broad, we entered a fine level well-cultivated country; and travelling at the rate of four miles an hour, at hall pail lour o'clock we again forded the T igris at D iarbekir. - W c had to wait till fun-rife, however, before the.gatcs could be opened. D iarbekir is a large populous city, and the capital ot an extenlive province ol the fame name. It is pleafantly' fitu- ated on an eminence upon the weftern banks of the T igris , and furrounded by a ft long loity wall built with hewn ftone. ^n the land-lide it has once been pro- tcclcd by three walls and two ditches, part ol which are ftill to be feen. Toward the river, which runs nearly half round the C1 ty, nature has ftron^Iy fortified it bv a folid160 A journey from india, folid rock about twenty feet perpendicu lar. On the walls are feveral towers, in which a guard is conftantly kept. They have alfo fome cannon here, chiefly brafs field pieces of a fmall calibre, and a few brafs mortars; but very few of cither are ferviceable. The city commands an extenfive and delightful profpcd over a fertile country, and the winding ftreams ol the 'i igris add much to the beauty of the fcene. It is well watered by means ot a canal from the T igris , which is cut feveral miles above, and in fome places through very rugged ground. A branch ot this canal runs on the outfide ot the walls, on the weftcrn lide of the city, and foon after falls into the river. On this branch are feveral corn mills; and it being very ftcep where thofe mills are built, the water falls upon the wheel, and by this means a fmall body of water acquires great power. They are fomething like our over-lhot mills in E ngland. I tooktowards england. 161 1 took a. guide and went through the greater part of the city. The houfes are built with hewn flone, and the llreets all paved. Many of the public edifices arc very elegant. The Armenian cathedral is a large and handfome ftruchire, about the length of Weftminfter-hall, but not fo wide. The roof is fupported by two Vows,of pillars, and the whole of the floor is covered with carpets, for even the Turks on entering it pull off their Ihoes. The Armenian mode of worfhip is nearly fimilar to that of, the Roman Catholics; they have their crucifixes and burning lamps. In the court before the cathedral is a very handfome fountain, which throws its water to a confiderable height. - I vifitcd the manufactories alfo, of which there are great numbers. They manufac ture copper, iron, wool, cotton, iilk, and Several other Itaples. Some of their wool is very fine, and the weavers are numerous. People of the fame trade ufually live to gether; thus, one ftreet contains nothing but weavers; another ftreet, Ihoe-makers; M another.162 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, another, fmiths, &amp;c. Their leather is very good, and they work it exceedingly Well. I had cafes made for my piftols, which were executed very neatly. Here are a great many dyers, and the waters of the T igris are faid to be peculiarly adapted to the purpofes ot that trade. In fome branches, thefe people are equal, if not fuperior, to many Euro peans; but the weavers are very interior to the Englifh; and the cloth they make, whether of woollen, cotton, or filk, is always very narrow. They entertain a very high opinion oi the 13ritifh manufac tures, and the very name of an EnglHh- man is fufficient to gain the greateft rc- fpecl. The fuperfine broad cloth worn by the principal people is of Englilh manulacturc, as arc alfo their watches, ot which lattei I faw a great many with Arabic characters, made by ' Brookbank, of Cornhill, Lon don,' and fome by ' Prior, in London. peopleTOWARDS ENGLAND. 1(73 People of all defcriptions feem here to enjoy much liberty. The various feels ot Chriftians have their ehapels and ehurches, and each follows his own mode of wodhip without molellation. My Tatar informed me, that there was a Padre here who could fpeak Englifh; but, as he was lame, if I wifhed to fee him I muft go to his houfe. I had fome doubts at firll whether the Tatar was in jefl: or earneli, as he often fpoke ironically; I therefore made him go with me. I found the Padre to be a Capuchin Friar, with his brown hooded cloak on. He was exceedingly ignorant, did not know a word of EnglHh, and underftood but little Latin. He was very corpulent, had got the gout, and appeared as if he had been long accuftomed to drink fomething ftronger than water. He was a father confeflbr, and had a round fcreen of black gauze that he could let down by a line from the ceiling, and which inclofed the fair penitents when they came to receive abfolution; but finding him fo extremely M 2 ignorant. i.16-ir a JOURNEY from INDIA, gnorant, and fuch a difgufting figure, 1 made a very fhort ftay. I conceived tliis to be a mere device of my Tatar, to Ihew what a mean opinion he entertained of the religion of the Franks, or, as they are commonly called, Fringuis (the Arabs and Turks calling Europe Fringuiftan). He certainly thought that I had been of the fame per- fualion, but finding me as little fatisfied with my vifit as himfelf, and being in formed by me that the Englifh had no more crucifixes and images in their mofques than the Turks, he was inclined to entertain a more favourable opinion oi the Englifh; and I do not remember his ever calling mc Fringui afterwards. I do not, indeed, wonder that the Turks fhould entertain fuch a prejudice againft the ChrifHan religion; for all the Chriftian countries bordering upon the Turkish empire (and even the Greeks and Armenians among the Turks) have their crucifixes and images, which reprefent a kindtowards england. 165 kind of idol worfhip, to which all MulTul- men have a particular averlion; and that alone is fufficient to prevent them from making any inquiries into the real merits of Chriftianity. I went a little above the city to bathe in the T igris, the hummums being too relaxing. I had bathed in the hummums both at B agdad and M osul, which an- fwers very well for cleanfing the Ikin, but I found much more benelit from bathing in cold water. I took with me a guide, and a fervant carrying fruit and retrefh- ments. The city has two gates to the weft ward, which are the only ones ever opened. There is one to the eaftward, but it is al ways kept ftiut, and we were in confc- quence obliged to go round greater part ot the city, which covers about a fcjuare mile, all the walls, except to the louthward, being quite ilraight, and about a mile long. Above the walls, on the call lide of the city, is a path cut through the M 3 folid166 a journey from india, folid rock, and another leading acrofs the hill towards the river. On the fide of this path are many holes cut out of the rock, large enough to hold half a dozen people, and into many of thefe the water falls from the rock perpendicularly. The lofty trees near the rock forming an agreeable fhade, and making it a pleafant cool re treat, wc faw, as we paffed along this path, many Armenian women and children bathing. I was a little furprifed to fee them as fair as any in E ngland; but they walk much better than the women in E urope, their loofc drefs allowing free a6Hon to the body, and they have be/ide a peculiar grace in every motion, to which Europeans are entire llrangers. Though D iarbekir is a populous city, provifions plentiful, good, and cheap, every inhabitant enjoying full liberty, and that it is in many other refped:s a de/ii- able place to live in, yet there is one thing which is both difagrceable and dan gerous, and reflets great difgrace on its government: the circumjacent country, to a con-towards england. a confiderable extent, is fo much infefted with banditti, that no one can travel to or from the city without a llrong military guard. tuesday, august 1. M y Tatar having procured from the Bafhaw an order for a guard, we fet out at half pa ft four o'clock in the afternoon, without any other than our own fervants. A Tatar wifhed to accompany us, but I was abfolute in refufing him, having be fore been detained for want of horfes when our party was numerous. We rode about five miles over a very rich country, the whole of which was well cultivated. At half pail five we arrived at the barracks where we were to receive our guard. As they were not ready, it was hall' paft feven before we fct forward. The guard confifted of an officer and fifteen men, all well mounted and armed, M 4 fomc168 a journey from india, feme with fpears, and others with fire arms. For a few miles we had a tolerably good road, and a fine open country, with a good deal of cultivation; but at ten o'clock we entered a wild defert country, the ground ol which for many miles was co vered with large flones, which made it very difagreeable travelling. At eleven we croffed the bed of a river, now dry, in which a large gang of banditti had pitched their tents. Our guard continued with us till midnight; but by that time we had got into a very good road, the guard, therefore, lelt us and returned. We now galloped for two hours as fall as the horfes could be made to go. wednesday, august 2.

The mountain on which it is found ed, is much fteeper than that of M ar din, and cannot be afccndcd in front. There is, therefore, a road up each fide of the mountain; and acrofs the front of it arc little narrow tracks, fo very lleep that a falfe flep would be inevitable deftrut^ion both to horfe and rider. What could in duce the building of a town in fuch a fituation it is difficult to conjecture. There is an extenfive plain below, with plenty of water; yet this is left wholly without cul tivation, except a little below the A r geenah mountain. The mountain appears at a diftance like a barren rock, incapable of producing any vegetation; and, indeed, there is no fpon- tancous producl; but the induftry of the inhabitants amply repairs the deficiency. In many places they have gardens, pro ducing various kinds of fruits and vegeta bles, and in others they even carry mould to170 a journey from india, to make little artificial gardens. They have plenty of good water, and the moun tain abounds in iron ore, in the extra6ling of which a great many people are em ployed. We only refted at A rgeenah two hours, fetting out again at feven o'clock on frefh horfes. Soon after our departure we found our- felves entered on a complex chain of mountains, fo replete with dangerous nar row paffes that we were above fix hours before we got over them. A confiderable branch of the T igris runs at the foot of thefe mountains, making a winding courfe among them. Over this there has formerly been a very fine bridge of three arches, but only one now remains entire. This bridge appears, by the rem nant of it, to have been the handfomeft piece of architecture that 1 had feen fince f entered the Turkiih dominions, Wc Itowards england, 171 We crofled a mountain above M ed an, which is commonly called A rgeenah M edan , leaving the town on our right.

I Ihould imagine that they would be good eating, but on enquiry I found that the natives never killed them. This is the mod weftern branch oi the Tigris , which rifes among fome hills at the head of this valley, and here feveral dreams uniting form a tolerably large river. Having crofled the valley, we turned to the right over fome rugged hills, and came to the fide of a confiderable falt-watcr lake, fifteen miles long and about lour broad. Though feveral fmall rivulets run into this lake, none run out of it. Towards the weft end of it is a fmall ifland called G urgeik , from which the lake takes it? name.towards england. i73 name. I he ifland is entirely covered with houlcs; and here are great numbers of boats, the inhabitants receiving water and every neceflary from the fhore. We pa/Ted the weft end of the Jake at fun-fet; but fome oi our horfes were fo much wearied, that it was with difficulty we could proceed; two of them, indeed, laid down, and we were obliged to leave them. Soon after quitting the lake we got again among fome lofty mountains, and at halt pall twelve o'clock at night arrived at a large town called G ermilly . Of the lalt thirty-two hours I was twenty-eight on horfeback, and out of the laft forty- tuo hours had only had one of fleep.

N ot having been able to procure frcfli horfes here, we fet out again at eleven o'clock on thofe which we brought from A rgeenah . After riding about eight miles over a very beautiful and well culti vated country, we reached another confi- derable town called K essireek at one o'clock. Here too we were unfuccefsful in get ting horfes, and vvc found a B agdad Ta tar, named M ala B ekir , waiting for the fame accommodation. He was returning from Constantinople to B agdad , with fix loads, being twelve bales of broad cloth, under his charge. For his merchandize and attendants he required fifteen horfes. 1 found, on enquiry, that the ufual al lowance for a horfe-load oi merchandize fromtowards england. 175 from C onstantinople to B agdad is five hundred piaftres. We remained here all day under fome trees by the fide of a pleafant ftream, and at night flept upon the ground in the open air. I had brought fome Hollands gin with me from B agdad ; but not being much accuftomed to drink fpirits, I gave the whole of it to M ala B ekir , who foon got drunk with it, together with a few more Tatars to whom he had given fome. The Turks who drink fpirits are certainly very beaftly in their manner of ufing them; for be the liquor ever fo ftrong, they will not touch it unlefs they have above half a pint for a draught. The Armenians in this country make a fpirit from the grape which they call Rackee, and this they fell privately to the Turks.

He was the fon of the Mafter of the Conac at Mosul., and was taken into our fervice by my permifsion, on which account I had received many civilities from his fa ther, who was particularly attentive to fhew mc every thing worth feeing in M o sul. This mifconducl of M ustapha induced my Tatar to beat him the following morn ing. Soon after he had been corre6ted, however, having a pair of piftols of his own, he attempted to fhoot the Tatar, but was prevented by fome of M ala B ekir's attendants. The piftols were now taken from him and broken to pieces; he was beaten again, and feemed to be very penitent and fubmifsive.

At five o'clock we arrived at a large £tn el ting-town, called G ab an M ed an. It is extremely populous, and great num- | bers ot its inhabitants are employed in collecting ore from the neighbouring mountains, as at A rgeenah M edan. Here is alio a very handfome mofque, and a lofty minaret, both built with hewn ftone. I he town is feated near the bottom of a ftecp mountain, a river running below it in a very deep channel, which foon alter joins the E uphrates . We had tra velled about ten miles by the fide of this river, pafsing many fteep precipices, and our path trequently fo very narrow, that it was with great difficulty our horfes could make good their footing. We left ( tAban M edan at ten o'clock, and foon arrived at the banks of the E u phrates , being only about a mile from 1 the111 L towards england. 183 the town. The river here ran in a very deep channel, and our way was down a narrow path cut through tne foiid rock. We then crofled in a ferry-boat, capacious enough to carry fifteen or twenty horfes. The river is at this place much larger than might be expeded at fo great a diilance from its mouth. I drank the water, and found it had a peculiar tafte, wholly unlike that of any other water that I had ever tafled. After crofsing the Euphrates , we en tered a llrait path between two lotty mountains, by which we continued af- cending for near two hours, keeping to the left, as much as we could. On the top, to my great furprizc, I found the ground highly cultivated. Proceeding a little farther, we reached the fummits of lomc higher mountains, on which were no figns of culture. From thefe, however, I had a moft extenfive profpecf. lo the noith- ward was a chain of exceedingly lofty mountains, ranging N. W. and S. E. hav ing their tops covered with inow.

On our left, to the fouthward, were many ftu- pendous mountains which fupply the other branch ot the E uphrates ; for in this way it receives almoli; the whole of its contents, no large rivers joining it till it meets the T igris. Me continued our route almoft due W ell over a very hilly country, with little cultivation, till feven o'clock in the even- ing, when we arrived at fome tents pitched on the top ot a mountain.

One of them boafted that he had feven wives, and enquired how many I had in E ngland . It muft be obferved, that in this country it is cuf- tomary for a man to have as many wives as he can fupport, and the more a man keeps, the better is he rcfpected. Many of the people in this country, during the fultry fummer months, leave their towns and villages, which lie chiefly in vallies, and e^pamp upon fome lofty Jiills, taking their flocks with them. On the mountains they enjoy a cooler purer air, and in general appear as fair and yuddy as the country people in E ng- j^am d. Leaving this encampment, we defcend- ed fome rugged pafTes by a road fo very bad, that it was fometimcs with much difficulty we could make our way. At ten o'clock we arrived at a fmall town called E mir , fituated on the weft iide ot a very pleafant and well cultivated valley, with18£) a youfney from india, # with a very fine ilream of water running towards the North. Here we remained all night, lleeping upon the bare ground. sunpay, august 6, F rom E mir we fet out at half pail; five o'clock. There being feveral Tatars, and a great many other people going our road, horfes were become very fcarcc. My Tatar, therefore, got a^|iule to carry his merchandize, and, joining a large party, they travelled very flowly. For fome time our way lay over Hony ground, which made our journey fatiguing and unpleafant. I pufhed on, however, with a Tatar who had only difpatches un der his care, and was going to H assan C hillaby . We palled over a very hilly and woody country, with feldom any track to diredl us. On this account we often loft our way; the Tatar's guide not being well acquainted with the country. Greattowards england. 187 Great numbers of people were here em-* ployed in making charcoal for the ufe of the fmelting-houfes at G aban M edan. They carry it from this place on mules in panniers, and we fometimes met fifty or lixty in a drove laden with it. Many of the peafantry here fix their dwellings by the fide of a hill, the top of the houfe being even with the ground; and I have often ridden over the top of a houfe without knowing it, and have with difficulty avoided falling through. At one o'clock we arrived at the en campment of H assan C hillaby ; for here alfo the inhabitants, having quitted the town, which was about two miles dif- tant, had encamped on a hill. I now found that we could not proceed farther without a very llrong guard. The people belonging to the tent wherein we refted were very attentive, and I was fortunate in cultivating the friend fhipa journey from india, friendflilp of the women, who took fome pains to provide fuch food and refrefh- inent as they thought I ihould like bell. I had alfo a favourable opportunity of ob- ferving their manners and cuftoms. The whole of the cattle belonging to thefe encampments are driven every morn ing into fuch of the vallies as contain the greateft plenty of water and vegetation, where they are watched all day by two or three perfons employed for that purpofe, and in the evening are brought back again. The tents are always pitched in a circle, and the cattle remain all night in the centre. The people rife at dawn of day, and the firft employment of the women is to milk their cows and goats, which are immedi ately fent off again to pafture. The wo men then put the milk into a fort of bottle made of a goat's (kin, every part of which is fewed up, except the neck; but when they are churning, the neck is tied with a firing clofe and tight enough to prevent the milk running out.

I t took up a long time to provide fuch a number of horfes as were now wanted; for in our train were forty horfe-loads of filver from A rgeenah M edan , for C on stantinople . The guard amounted to fifty horfemen; but the iilver was under the immediate care of two Tatars and an officer of diflincSlion. The troops were commanded by three elderly men. The whole party fet out at eight o'clock in the morning. The troops fcoured the country on each fide of the road, going at full fpeed into every inlet where they could expert to find any of the banditti that infeit this country. Abouttowards england. About four miles from H assan C hil- laby , we found neither cultivation nor iuhabitants, though there is plenty of good water, and the foil appears favour able for culture. We met a caravan going to D iarbekir, and 1 had the favour with my Tatar of drinking coffee with the Chiei. The caravan confifted of horfes, aflfcs, and mules, camels not being able to thrid many of the fteep narrow paffes with which this country abounds. For about fifteen miles my Tatar and I kept company with our guards; but we then pufhed on at a brilk gallop for about feven more; and at one o'clock arrived at H adjee K han. This is a large village lying in a valley. The land is well cultivated for about halt a mile round it; but the inhabitants in general are very poor, and much addidled to thieving. tuesday,152 A jaUENEY FROM INDIA^ tuesday, august 8. W e fct out this morning at half paft five o'clock with the filvcr. havinsr the' fame guard as yeflerday. The firft part of this day's journey was over a hilly coun try, and the horfes with the filver tra velling very llowly, I went before the reft at an cafy trot till I got about two miles before them, when I came to fome lofty mountains^ from which I had a very ex- tenfive profpech The face of the coun try, however, had not a very favourable appearance, being chiefly mountainous, except to the N. W. which exhibited a very extenfive plain without any cultiva tion, and over which lay our road. On this plain were three encampments, pitched in a triangle. Two of thefe were near the path, but I continued my route at about two miles before the reft of the company, not having any idea that I was in (ganger. Whentowards england. 193 When I got abreafi; of the firft encamp ment, an officer and fix men from the guard came up to me on full gallop, and faid that the people in the encampment would cut my throat. They took hold of my bridle and wanted me to return; but thinking it ufelefs, as a part of the guard were now in fight, I remained here till the whole of our party came up. A few men came from the encampment and converfed with the officer. They were remarkably Itrong hardy-looking fellows, but had a fomething in their countenances which feemed to indicate that they did not get their livelihood very honeftly. Having enquired who I was, the officer told them that I was an Englifii Conful, that being the title which I bore in the firmaun. The men examined the arms of our guard very attentively, and wi(bed to lay hold of fome of them, but the guards would not fuffer it. I was not under the Icall apprehenfion of their doing me any perfonal injury, even before the military came up; for in cafe they had attacked O . me194 A JOURNEY FROM INDIA* me I fhoulcl not have attempted to refirt^ but I thought it prudent afterwards to keep near my Tatar, On our reaching the fecond encamp ment, four men, armed with fabres and piftols, flood in the Way to oppofe our pafsing; and as we rode up, they feizcd my bridle, my Tatar 's, and thofe of two other Tatars in company, who were all riding abreafi: a little before the military. I was perfe6lly pafsive, not fuppofing that they could mean to rob us, as the military were only a few yards behind. A fcuftic, however, enfued; but the guard coming up rcfcued me. The man who had held my bridle in one hand had a drawn fabrc in the other; but on one of the officers telling him that I was an Englifh Gonful, he immediately let go the bridle. I had my piftols ready, and was prepared to have ihot my opponent, had any of the Tatars fired; but I did not think it proper to be- gin,, not knowing the intentions of thefo people. One of the Tatars cocked a pif- 4 ^ul to fhoot a young man who fcemed toI Avt) towards england. 195 fee very violent; but the military inter fering prevented him. The young man^ however, continuing to threaten the Ta tar with his fabre, the guard, by order of one of the officers, furrounded him in fuch a manner with their fpears and fabres, that had he moved an inch he mult have been killed. In that fituation we left them; but they foon after came up with Us, and had not put the young man to death as I expected. Thefe people feem to be mod violent tigainft the Tatars, who frequently pafs through the country without paying any tribute; for^ being the meflcngers of go vernment, they think they ought to be exempt* The people here had demanded fifteen piaftres from each Tatar, who, having fuch a ftrong guard with them, boldly refufed* The young man whom I have juft mentioned as having been more Violent than the reft, had lately had a brother Ihot by a Tatar* flm O 2 This196 a journey from india, This is a very extenfivc uncultivated plain, and contains neither fheep nor cat tle but what belong to thefe banditti. The ground, however, being favourable to tilting, and the horfes with the filver tra velling very flovvly, our guards made fe- veral matches. They would fometimes draw out of the ranks half a dozen on each fide, and throw blunted fpcars, at which exercife thefe men are wonderfully dexterous, being able to pick up fpears from the ground without quitting their hones. They have alfo a particular me thod of avoiding their opponents fpears by hanging down on the oppofite fide of the horfe, and thus expofing only one foot, yet at the fame time going on full gallop. 13ut though the men are at this exercife fo much fupcrior to Europeans, I was even more entertained by obferving the motions of the horfes, fome of which were beau- tiful white Arabians. The horfeman makes very little ufe of the reins on thefe occa- fions, and the horfe is governed by the motions of the rider's body. If the latter lean0 towards england. 197 lean towards the right or left, the horfe will turn to that Tide, and if the motion be quick will gallop full fpeed. If the rider lean forward, the horfe gallops ftraighton; and if the man raife his body upright, the horfe, though at that time on full fpeed, will flop in a moment, without the rider touching the bridle. At about fix miles diftance from the fe- cond encampment, we approached an other, the Chief of which came to us alone, and demanded money from our commanding officer, which was refufed. He got, however, a few piaftres from my Tatar. We then continued unmolefted till we got within about two miles of D electe- tas , when we obferved fome men armed, on horfeback, purfuing us at full fpeed from the fecond encampment, where it will be remembered we had the difpute. Ihe Tatars, being much frightened, fet out full gallop for D electetas , and as I O 3 was195 a journey from india, was dreffed in the fame manner, and thought they might take me for a Tatar, I pufhed on with them, leaving the mili tary drawn up to receive them, We arrived at D elfxtetas at two o'clock, and the Tatars hid thcmfelves tor fome time, Idlthey ihould be purfued in to the town. When the banditti came up with the military, and found that the Tatars had rode off, they returned. Thefe people always keep a number of horfes near their tents to be mounted at a fhort notice, anc} fome of them ready bridled and faddled, The military themfelves were very imi portunate for money, and 1 have, not un-s frequently, been feized by fome of the common foldiers, but they were always fatislied if I only gave them a few paras. This indeed was almoft always the cafe when they could find me alone; and even the officers were not above afking tor mo- 5 ney ^towards england. 199 fficy; but as I did not expect any harfli treatment from them, I always referred Ihem to my Tatar. D electetas is a fmall town, fituated on the fide of a mountain, in a barren country, and having little cultivation about it in proportion to the number of its in habitants. Here is plenty of good water; and in the middle of the town is a large fquare Hone building. This, as I have obferved fimilar ftru&amp;ures in feveral towns, I am inclined to think is intended as bar racks for foldiers, having a great number of fire-places in them. Many of the inhabitants have ftacks of corn on the tops of their houfes. Here alfo were fome ftacks of hay, being the firlt that I had feen in A sia , a proof that the^ winter is very feyere among thefe mountains. O 4 WEDNESDAY,200 a journey from india, wednesday, august 9. We fet out from D electetas at feven o'clock this morning, mounted on very fine liorfes, and with the fame military guard as before. On leaving D electetas , we had very rough roads among fome fteep mountains covered with fir-trees. Beyond thefe, we croffed an extenfive uncultivated plain, flmilar to that we had come over the day before. After pafsing fome mofl dangerous places, where, in cafe we had been attacked by banditti^ we could neither have pufhed forward nor returned to our guard, we gal loped a few miles, accompanied by one of the military officers who had the care of my perfon. At ten o'clock we arrived at a town called U llash , pleafantly fituated by the 5 fidetowards england. fide of a river which flows from the moun tains we had paflcd, and runs into the river C asalmack . Between the town and fome mountains to the northward are two fait lakes, one about three miles in circumference, the other about two. From U llash , in the neighbourhood of which there is a great deal of cultivation, we de parted at eleven o'clock. Our efcort had taken a different route, going between the mountains on our right and the two fait lakes. We overtook them in an hour, but did not remain with them long. I obferved feveral other lakes of the fame kind on our left, which are very eafily diftinguiflied, their Ihores being crulled with fait. • We now palTed over feveral fine plains, though wholly uncultivated, and at two o'clock afcended fome very high moun tains, from which I had an extenfive prol- ped:. On our right to the northward were feveral large towns, and a fine well culti vated country. Beyond that was an ex ceeding^02 a journey from india, ceeding lofty mountain covered with fnow, from which the river C asalmack takes its rife. I have rarely wjtnefTed a more beautiful profpe6l than I had from this mountain, particularly over the country to the North, the winding ftreams of the river C asalmack enriching the fcene. On the top of thefe mountains the road was tolerably fmooth, and our horfes being good we gallopped as fall as they could go, and pafied over much ground in a Ihort time. At three o'clock we dcfcended by a very fteep road, and, after crofsing the river C asalmack by a neat ftorje bridge of three arches, arrived at S ivas. S ivas is a very large populous town, and exceedingly well watered, having fe-» veral fountains and a great many clear breams running through it, It is feated on the weft fide of a very fertile valley, which is almoft furrounded by lofty mountains, having no opening except where the river runs in and out, through a verytowards england. 5203 a very narrow channel between two deep Jiills. Here are two ftone bridges at about a mile diitance from each other. Great quantities of corn grow in this valley, but not much fruit, excepting plums, apples, and pears; but of garden vegetables there is great abundance. In the middle of the town are fome very extenfive gardens; and on an artificial hill js aii old caftie now tumbling into ruins. Though the neighbourhood furnifhes plenty of good materials for building, the houfes in general have a very ordinary ap pearance, a great quantity of unfquared timber being employed to fupport an im- menfe weight of Hone and clay, with which the houfes are covered. The inha bitants appear to enjoy much liberty ; nor are the women confined, as in fome large cities to the eaftward, S ivas is nearly as large as L iverpool, contains as many houfes, and is, I think, fully as populous, Though moft ot the204 a journey from india, private houfes are but indifferent ftrii(5lures, many of the public buildings are elegant, and fome of the minarets very lofty. I This might be faid to be the firfl civi lized place we had met with fince we left G ab an M ed an ; for the greatefi: part of that extenfive country through which we had pa fled is infefted by numerous tribes ol roving banditti, who, like many of the Arab tribes, have no fixed habitation, nor ever continue long in one place ; and even the military are afraid to moleft them. JThe fmall towns we had come through were little more than military flations, where troops are always kept for the pur- pofe ol conducting thofe who travel under the protedlion of the government. From this place to C onstantinople no guard is neceffary, and the forty loads of filver required only the officer and the two Ta tars to protect it. thursday,TOWARDS ENGLAND. 205 thursday, august 10. W e were detained for want of horfes till nine o'clock this evening, when, late as it was, we fet out from S ivas , accom panied by twelve more Tatars. Soon after we had left the town we afcended fome very lofty mountains, on the top of which was a plain for a few miles; but we foon got again among lieep heights, and conti nued travelling as fart as the road would permit. At day-break we arrived at the foot of a very lofty mountain, in the fhape of a fugar-loaf; which, notwithftanding our then very elevated fituation, appeared as high above us as any mountain in E ng land. We continued among thefe heights till ten o'clock, when we defcended through fome fieep narrow paifes and ar rived at Toe at. Throughout206 a joi/rney from indla| Throughout this ftage tlie roads were tolerably good, confidering the tace of the country; and we had not fo many fright ful precipices to pafs as in the neighbour hood of M edan . There was only one indeed that could be reckoned dangerous, and that was over a ftone bridge of two arches near the higheft mountain. One of the arches was nearly down, having only a very narrow path ftanding, that fcarcely left room for a horfe, and no pa rapet to prevent accident. T ocat is about the fize of S ivas , but lias a much better appearance than any town that I had before feen in the Turkifli dominions. The houfesrare all tiled, and chiefly built with wood. Here was the greatefi; abundance of fruits that I ever faw, and remarkably fine in their kind; the grape vines, in particular, were abun dant and excellent. The Armenians, who are very numerous here, make an excel lent red wine, of a flavour fomething like claret, but much ftronger. I fent my Tatartowards england. Tatar to purchafe feme, and he brought about two gallons, taking care alfo to pur- chafe as much rackee. On tafling the wine I found it had a very ftrong body, and did not drink above half a wine gjafs* There were a great many Tatars and Turks in company, who laughed very heartily at my drinking wine, obferving, that I drank it like coffee. They would not tafte it, unlefs they had at leaft a pint to take off at a draught, and with the wine and rackee they all got drunk. I now went into the Bazar to buy fome fruit, and found that 1 could purchafe for the value of a farthing as much as a man could cat of either mulberries, pears, ap ples, peaches, or apricots; and thole, in general, much finer in their kind than •ever I faw in E urope. The town is furrounded by eminences^ find is well watered. On the top of a lofty rocky mountain, on the welt fide of the town, arc the remains of an old caftle.208 a journey from india, caAle, part of the wall of which has been built on the edge of a very fteep rock^ and much of it has fallen down the pre cipice. What could have induced the early in habitants of thcfe countries to build in fuch fituations I cannot imagine. I have generally obferved the ruins of cafUes in fituations very difficult of accefs, and with their fronts always on the edge of a frightful precipice. Every neceflary muft have been conveyed into them with much trouble, except water, which is always plenty among high mountains. They have been all built with hewn Itone, but have not fuch heavy mafTy walls as wc often meet with among ancient ruins in other parts of the world. They appear to have been built with a tafte almoll equal to our befl; pieces of modern architecture. FRIDAY,towards england. 209 friday, august 11; W e fet out, a very large party, from J ocat at halt pall four o'clock this after noon; and, being all badly mountedf and the greater part drunk, made a curious figure as we rode through the town. The ftreets being much crowed, the Tatars roared hke fo many bulls for the people to clear the palfage, every one being obliged to give way to them, as in E ngland to the mail coaches; and if they were not very quick in getting out of the road, they were lure to feel fome of the Tatars long whips. From the town to the banks of the river C asalmack , about a mile, is entirely co hered with gardens and orchards. We lorded the C asalmack , and, turning Nearly due W T eft, travelled for about e ighteen miles through one of the moll beautiful vales I ever faw. The richnefs ^ the foil, and the great number of in- P habitants.210 a journey from india, habitants, has compelled them to partition the land ; a cireumflanee that I had never before obferved finee I left India, exeept in the cafe of gardens and orchards. The river Casalmack runs through this vale, and the hills on each fide are covered with trees. We turned to our right, and alter crofsing fome woody heights, arrived at half pafi; nine o'clock at a fmall town called As sin, in which Hands a large fquare flone building as at Delectetas, saturday, august 12. We fet out this morning from As sin at live o'clock, and a little below the town crofled, by a wooden bridge, a river that runs into the Casalmack. We now took a courfe nearly due Eaft, having high mountains on each fide covered with trees. We then turned to the North up a valley, which interfe6lcd this range ol hills on our left, and continued for about five miles. Attowards england. £&gt;11 At the head ot this valley was a cofiee- houfe, where we refted a fhort time and diank coflee. Our party, not having been able to get either wine or rackce fince we left Tocat, were all become pretty fober again. AVe now crofled fome very high hills at the head oi this valley, thickly covered with trees, and entered a fine well culti vated vale, lying Eaft and Weft. We turned to our left down this vale, the hills on each fide covered with wood, and when we had travelled about fifteen miles turned again to the North over lome lofty moun* tains, among which we continued till we defcended to Amasia, where we arrived at two o'clock; though fome of our horfes Were fo much tired that we had been obliged to leave them in the mountains. For nearly a mile above the town was a deep valley, in which were many gardens a nd orchards. There was alfo a fine Stream of water running from the moun- P 2 tains212 a journey from india, tains that we had come over, on which were feveral mills. A masia is a very extenfive and popu lous town, nearly as large as T ocat , and is furrounded by many lofty rugged moun tains. The faces of fome of thefe moun tains have nearly half a mile of almoll perpendicular height; and in one ot thefc are feveral places cut in the folid rock, fimilar to a Hindoo Pagoda, and which can only be approached by little narrow paffes cut through the rock. The river C asalmack runs through A masia , but cannot be feen at one view for more than the length of the town, making a circuitous courfe* among the mountains, and running in a deep narrow channel both above and below the town. It is here a very large river, but much too rapid for navigation. The town is well watered, particularly the lower parts, by means of large wheels neartowards england. 213 near thirty feet in diameter. Thefe are turned by the ttream, having a great many large buckets fattened to them. As the wheel turns round, thofe buckets empty themfelves into troughs fixed within a few feet as high as the wheel. By this method they are enabled to keep up a con tinual It ream of water, which is conveyed by pipes from the troughs to the hum- mums, fountains, &amp;:c. The houfes in Amasia are moftly built with wood, but many with ftone, and co vered with tiles as at Tocat. The greater part ol the inhabitants being Chriftians, here is only one mofque, and two lofty minarets, all built with hewn ftone, and very handfome ftru6lures. The dome of the mofque is covered with lead. The hummums are very extenfive, and built with hewn ftone. Before thefe arc fome pleafant walks, with feveral rows of trees, and the whole is furrounded by a lofty wall. P 3 The21^ a journey from india, The town can only be approached by two narrow palfcs, one toward the North, and another toward the South; and thefe are fo very rugged, narrow, and fteep, that they might be eafily defended by a very fniali force. They make here a very good white wine, fomething like fherry, and very iirong. With this and rackee our whole party again got drunk. A S ivas Tatar, named S uliman , who had accompanied us from S ivas , attempted to fhoot an other Tatar who was returning from C on stantinople , but was prevented by the reft interfering. It is impofsible to de- fcribe the confufion among thofe people when they quarrel. Upon the flighteft provocation they have immediate recourfe to their arms, for they are never without a brace of piftols and a dagger by their fide. I have feen many quarrels among them, and fome of the party feverely wounded, but ncv^r remember any to have been killed upon the fpot. My4 towards england. 215 My Tatar not being quite ready, I fet out at Icven o ciock in the evening with a i in k who had accompanied us from S ivas. He Lad four horfcs under his care, one for his guide, one tor himfcli, and two with each a pair of leather bags, but not heavy. He came under the protection of S uli- man , the Tatar. This Turk was as fond of wine and rackee as any of them, and was reckoned by the Turks a very fine finger. Whenever we entered or left a town, lie would ling and roar loud enough to be heard a mile. I have frequently fecn the people run out of doors in great numbers to hear him. Soon after we had left the Conac, our furk having drank as much wine and rackee as rendered it fomewhat difficult for him to keep on horfeback, he began finging and roaring, and whipping his guide; fo that before we got out of A m asi a the guide wiihed to return, but the Turk would not permit him. P 4. We21&lt;5 a journey from india, We afcended a very lofty mountain to wards the northern pafs, and before we got to the top it became very dark. As we came near a fpring of water, the guide faid that he wanted to drink. Putting, therefore, the fore-horfe's bridle into the Turk's hand, to hold till he returned, he availed himfelf of the darknefs of the night to run away unperceived. We waited for him fome time, but at lafl, fuf- pe6ting the cafe, ' purfued our journey. The Turk leading three horfes, we with fome difficulty got to the top. Here we i'oon loft our road, but were fortunate enough to difcovcr a light about eleven o'clock, which we found proceeded from a fmall encampment, where fome ot the inhabitants of Amasia were employed in getting in their harveft. I was very happy to meet with thefc people; for the Turk being ftill drunk, the night dark, and the ground ftecp, I found myfelf very unplea- fantly fituated. Even after we difcovercd the light, we had to dcfcend fome very lleep places before wc could reach it. When \vc *towards england. 217 we had got to the encampment, we tied the live horfes together, and went to fleep upon the ground. sunday, august 13. 1 ite lurk having been much refre/lied Ins 11ccp, at hall palt two o'clock we got ready, it being now a little moonlight, and by the afsiftance of one of the people belonging to the encampment we got into the right road. It was very rough and , Itccp lor lome time, and I was glad when it became day-light. At length we got from among thefc dangerous Iteeps, and defcended into an cxtcnlive uncultivated ^ale about lilteen miles over. We gal loped mo ft of the way acrofs this vale, the Turk leading the horfes, and I ading the pait ol a latar, in whipping the horfes to keep them on a gallop. We arrived at M arsiwan at half part fix o'clock, where we found the reft of our party. Our Tories were completely knocked up; even mine.218 a journey from india, mine, though a very good one, was, by galloping from one fide to the other to whip the horfes, become fo weary, that I was afraid I Ihonld have been obliged to leave him before we reached Marsiwan. The Turk feemed much gratified by the afsiftance 1 had given him. Marsiwan is a town nearly as large as Sivas , and fituatcd near the foot ot fome woody mountains on the north fide ot this exlenfive vale. It is well watcicd, and abounds with corn, as well as moft kinds of fruits, which were now ripe. Ihey have many vineyards near the town, and make a very good red wine fimilar to that which we had at Tocat . The Turk who had accompanied me Irom Amasia again got drunk, and roared till he became cx- cefsively di(ordered in his llomach. We fet out again from Marsiwan at eight o'clock, and continued on the north fide of the vale for about twenty miles. At the welt end is a town called Ajamq^ e &gt; fituatcdtowards england. 219 fituated in a very line country; we did not, however, go through this town, but paficd it on our left. We now turned to the northward, and entered a very hilly woody eountry, thridding feveral fteep and narrow pafles by the fide ot a river, fome of which were fo lolly and deep as to make my head giddy. M e met with little cultivation after we pafled Ajamque , till we arrived in the neighbourhood of Osmanjike , which we reached at feven o'clock. The town of Osmanjike is built round a deep rocky mount, on the top of which alio fome houfes have been erected. It is a tolerably large town, and Hands on the banks ot the river Atoezu, We fet out again at eight o'clock in the evening, and crolTed the river over a neat ftone bridge of fifteen arches. We then continued on the weftern banks of 2 the220 a journey from india, the river, and rode very faft over much rough and woody ground. It was very dark tiil the moon rofe; but we continued to ride as faft as our horfes could go till half pait twelve o'clock, when we arrived at a fmall town called Hadjee Hamza. This ftage was thirty miles. monday, august 14. ' We fct out this morning from Hadjee IIamza at fix o'clock, and continued for about an hour on the banks of the river Atoezu . We then found the river take a turn to the northward, being joined by another confiderable one that flows from the weftward. We forded the latter, and continued on the north fide of it lor two hours. The country through which we pafled was very hilly and woody ; near the river were feveral paddy grounds, and as much cultivation as the face of the coun try would permit. We rode brifkly all the morning, and at ten o'clock arrived at ' Tosia , a neat town built on the fide ot a hill,towards england. 221 hill, at the foot of which is a fine fertile country. This llnge was twenty-feven miles. Quitting Tosia at one o'clock, we palled feveral vineyards, and then got into a very hilly woody country. We travelled lome time by the fide of a river, on the banks of which were a few paddy grounds in fuch fpots as were capable of cultiva tion. We rode brilkly the grcatefl part of this llage, and arrived at feven o'clock at a fmall town called Cojasate , fituated in a barren hilly country. The Conac here is a new building, and had better accom modations than I had met with fince I left Bagdad. From Cojasate we fet out at ten o'clock at night. Till the moon rofe, it was very dark, and the roads bad. The Tatars galloped as faft as they could, and in about an hour we got out of the bad road into a country rather hilly, but per fectly clear from wood. In defcending a hill, a horfe fell down and broke one of his222 &gt; a journey from india, his fore-legs. lie was loaded with a pair of leathern bags belonging to the Sivas Tatar Suliman ; the trappings were im mediately taken off the horfe, and put on another; fo that we were not detained many minutes. Leaving the horfe upon the ground, we fet out again, the road becoming tolerably good, except being rather hilly. We continued to ride as laft as our horfes could go, and in two hours after the firft accident, galloping full fpeed down a hill, another horfe fell, broke his neck, and died inilantly. e were not, however, much detained by this accident, having plenty of fpare horfes; but rode more moderately alter the fecond accident, and arrived at half paft two o'clock at Carachurin .

This is a fmall and ill-built town, con- taming about two thoufand inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in cultivating the neighbouring plains. Want of fre/h horfes detained us here till one o'clock, when we again fet out, and, after travelling over a fine cultivated open country for twelve miles, arrived at half pall two o'clock at S erkees , a fmall but neat town, many ot the houfes being built with hewn ftone. We dined here, and iet out again on the fame horfes at three o'clock. Wea journey from' india, AVe rode brifkly over a fine well culti vated country till five o'clock, when we got among fome very lleep mountains, great part of the road over which was fa dangerous, that one falfe ftep of the horfe would have plunged us from the height of at lealt three hundred yards into a ri\cr. Quitting at length thefe dangerous paffes, we entered a fine open country on our right, where was a fmali town by the fide of a river. We turned, however, to the left, and arrived at Bainder at fix o'clock. This ftage was eighteen miles. Bainder is a fmall town, but fhmcls on an eminence, and at a diitanee has a very pretty appearance. The mofque is an indifferent building, but the minaret is very handfome and lofty; and the houfes are chiefly built with wood. We left Bainder on frefh horfes at ten o'clock; and, though it was very dark till the moon rofc, and the roads indilferent, wetowards england. 225 we reached Jeredarc at half pad two in the morning, without meeting with any . accident. wednesday, august 1^. On our arrival at Jeredarc , we met with good accommodations. The town is in an elevated lituation, being almoft at the top of a high hill, and it being a cool morning they had a good fire in the Co- nac, and the people were civil and atten tive. The town is large, and has a good Ba zar, well fupplied. They excel here in manufacturing leather, and many other articles; and there are alfo feveral copper man u factories. ihe houfes have a fingular appearance, being in general built with large round trees let into each other at the ends, and the crevices filled up with clay. Very Q few226 a journey from india, few houfes are tiled, being chiefly covered with deal boards. We left Jeredarc at feven o'clock, and for the firft five miles pafled through a hilly woody country. We then entered a very fine cultivated vale, furrounded with hills covered with wood. In the midft of this vale is a fine lake of frefli water. Here is a great deal of corn; the coun try is cultivated nearly the whole way to Boli ; and it appeared to me to produce more corn, in proportion to the extent 01 land, than I had feen in any part ot Eng land . Here was alfo abundance of fruits of various kinds. After pafsing feveral villages both to the right and left, we arrived at Boli at two o'clock. This flage is forty miles. About half way between Jeredarc and Boli I obferved fome ruins, of which inofttowards england. 227 moft ol the ftone was marble. Much of it appearing to have been cut in a ftile of workmanfliip fuperior to any Turkifh ma- lonry that I had yet feen, I was induced to take a nearer view, and rode among the ruins. On one marble column I faw fe- veral Greek letters, but much defaced. I was able, however, to trace the word and am perfuaded, that could I have fpared time, I might have been able to have made out great part of the infcrip- tion. My latar and the reft of the party had lett me behind, and I was in confe- quence prevented from flopping fo long as 1 could have wi/hed. About three miles nearer Boli , on the right fide of the road, are fome more ruins, with walls of an ex traordinary thicknefs; but I did not obferve any thing interefting among them, and therefore pafled on. Boli is a large town in a fertile fitua- hon. It contains, however, nothing worthy of particular notice. The mofques, minarets, and hummums* are all very or dinary buildings. The public editices are Q 2 nume-228 a journey from india, numerous, and the town is well fupplied with good water. From Boli we fet out on frelh horfes at half pafl feven o'eloek. It beeame very dark in about an hour, at which time i we entered a large foreft, wherein we continued for twenty-five miles. Ihis, my reader may imagine, was difagree- able enough; tor the night was fo daik, that I could fearcely fee my horfe's head and was frequently in danger ol being knocked out of my feat by the branches ot trees. It was with fome difficulty that our party could keep together, and the load was fometimes io very fteep, that I could fcarcely lit my horfe. thursday, august 17. In this extenfive foreft we continued till we nearly reached Duchea , at which place we arrived at two o'clock, after fording a large river. I his ftage was thirt) - fix miles. Ducheatowards england. 229 Duch^a is a fmall village fituated in a very fertile country, but entirely fur- rounded by large forefts. 'We departed thence at fix o'clock* and foon entered a woody country with very little cultivation. On our road we met a hundred horfemen conducing a Turkilh Bafhaw, who rode in the centre of the troops in a palanquin carried by four mules, two before and two behind. The palanquin was flung fo as to be eafy in every pofition. We foon entered another thick for eft, fimilar to that which we had palled through the night before. In this we had to travel about twenty miles, and arrived at Hindak at half pafl twelve o'clock. This ftage is twenty-feven miles. Hindak is an inconfiderable town, fitu ated in a valley amid large forefts, and contains nothing worthy of particular no tice. Q 3 It230 a journey from india, It was half paft five o'clock before we were able to procure frefh horfes here; and feeing nothing but torefts around us, I was unwilling to proceed, as it would be dark long before we could reach S abanja , and I recolle6led the many dangers we had efcaped the preceding night; but after being well allured by the Tatars that the road was tolerable, I con- fentcd to proceed. For the firft three hours we travelled through a woody country, partly culti' vatcd in the interjacent vallies. 'VVe now pafTed upwards oi a thoufand buffaloes carrying Ihip-timber to Con stantinople from the torefts through which we had travelled. Some oi the timbers were remarkably fine; and the whole had been fquared and formed in the forefts, where we had feen many fawyers at work as we came through. At nine o'clock we crofled the river Z acharea over a wooden bridge about a o quartertowards england. 231 quarter of a mile long. We were, how ever, obliged to difmount and walk over this bridge; for, inftead of planks, it was covered with half round pieces of wood, which frequently gave way under the horfes feet, and it had neither parapet nor railing. After crofsing the Zacharea , we con tinued in a very woody country till we ar rived at the lake Sabanja ; whence, keeping along the weftern fhore, we ar rived at half pail eleven o'clock at the town of the fame name. This ftage was thirty-fix miles. The lake Sabanja is near fix miles long, and nearly of a triangular form. It is a very fine fiieet of frelh water, and its being fituated in a woody country, adds much to its beauty. I found the road tolerably good all the way, as the Tatars had reprefented at Hindak. Behind Sabanja , to the fouthward, is ftill a continuation of thofe extenfive Q 4 forefh232 a journey from india, forefts through which wev had travelled. They are above two hundred miles in length, and about iixty broad. In fome places they are very lofty, and form an extenfive chain of mountains ranging Eaft and Weft, which I have always obfervcd to have been their fituation fince I came into the.country. Our route through the lorefts was generally North, and acrofs thefe was a paved caufeway that conti nued the whole way. It appears to be very ancient, and is now much out of re pair. The ftones are very large, and the earth in many places has been wafhed away from both fides of the pavement to the depth of near three feet. It is in many places undermined, and has fallen down; yet, though it is'now fo very rough that the horfes can only go upon it in a few places, it ftill ferves as a guide to thofe who travel acrofs thofe forefls. FRIDAY,towards england. ^33 friday, august 18. We fet out this morning from Sabanja at four o'clock, and rode through a beau tiful country. At about eight miles dif- tance we had a fine profpecl of Ism it, which we reached at half pafl eight o'clock. Ismit is a large town, and has a de lightful appearance from the valley before it. The houfes are not over-crowded, and the profpedt is much enlivened by cyprefs trees interfperfed all over the place. The lower part of the town is waihed by the fea. Being built on the Hope of a hill facing the South, it is very well fupplied with water; and on the fide of the hill, both to the Eall and Weft, are many vine yards and orchards, but more particularly to the weltward, which is entirely covered with gardens, orchards, and vineyards, for five or fix miles. The neatnefs of the town, the garden grounds, the fea, the finely.usa a journey from india, finely-cultivated country on the oppofite ihore, and the two rivers, with the corn fields in the vale before the town, form al together one of the fineil profpeds I ever law. We fet out from I smit at half pad nine o'clock, and continued near the fea, fome- times on the beach. About twenty miles Weft from that place are fome ancient ruins clofe to the fea. Part of the walls, fome of which are about ten feet thick, have fallen on to the beach. Seven miles further Weft is the town of C oushan, very pleafantly fituated on the fide of a hill (loping gradually to the fea. About this town are many hundreds of acres difpofed in vineyards, and gardens for a great variety of other fruits, which were now chiefly ripe. At C oushan we left the fea and turned northward. After we had paffed the vine yards belonging to the town, we entered a very fine plain, through the middle ol whichtowards england. 235 which runs a fmall river that has a neat (lone bridge of three arches over it. We now rode brilkiy moll of the way, and arrived at half pad five o'clock at G abaza. G abaza is a fmall but neat town, pleafantly fituated on the fide of a hill, from the top of which is a very fine pro- fpecl of the A rchipelago , and part of its numerous iflands. From the town to the fea, which is about three miles, is entirely covered with gar dens, orchards, vineyards, and corn-fields. From G abaza we departed at half paft fix o'clock on frclli horfes, and pafsing through a very fine country near the fea, fometimes on the beach, arrived at a town called M aricar , where we remained an hour to refrefh. r # We fet out again; but, going very flowly, it was two o'clock before we reached S cutari. 1 lere23(5 a journey from india, Here we rode down to the fea-beaeh, u n fad died our horfes, and remained till day-break, when we procured a boat, put into it what little baggage I had with me, and crofled over to C onstantinople to have it examined at the Cullom-houfe. The officer fuftered it to pafs upon re ceiving a piaftre; and we crofied o^cr to P era , to the houfe oi P eter 1 ooke, Efq. the Eaft India Company's Agent, to whom T had letters of recommendation. t C onstantinople having been fo often defcribed by travellers, and being fo well known to Englifh readers, the author thinks it neither expedient nor proper to fwell this volume by accounts that can not pofsibly poffefs either novelty or in- tcrell to recommend them. His objccl has been to defcribe fuch parts as he has vifited, and which had been but little ire- quented by former travellers from EisG- land. friday,towards england. 237 friday, august 25. H aving flayed a week at C onstan tinople , I obtained frefh paflports from the Porte, and from the Imperial Minifter Baron H erbert de R athkaal , and at half paft feven o'eloek in the evening of this day let out, aeeompanied by a Jani zary, who was to be paid three hundred piallres to conduct me to the frontiers. After travelling two or three miles from C onstantinople , we entered an open country without the fmallell marks of cultivation, and not bearing the leafl ap pearance of being in the vicinity of a large city. Even round the city itfelf the garden grounds and orchards are very fmall in proportion to the population. At nine o'clock, looking back towards C onstantinople , I obferved a dreadful fire, which my Janizary informed me was at S cutari. We238 a journey from india, We continued our route over an open barren hilly country, travelling at the rate of five miles an hour; and at half pad ten o'clock arrived at a final 1 neat town called Chaque Medja. This- town is pleafantly feated at the head of a fait lake about fifteen miles Jong, but of very unequal breadth. The lake is about two hundred yards from the Archipelago , but has communication with it by a very narrow channel over which is a flone bridge. The ground being fwampy, there is a flone caufeway of about a quarter of a mile long, for the convenience of paflengers. saturday, august 26, We fet out from Chaque Medja this morning at half paft five o'clock; and after crofsing the bridge and caufeway at the head of the lake, afcended fome hills, whence we had a very fine profpeft over the Archipelago and the furrounding country,towards england. 239 country, which had a more favourable ap pearance than in the neighbourhood of Constantinople , it being in high cul tivation and almoft crowded with villages. After leaving feveral vineyards on our right, we arrived at Beu Chaque Medja at half palt eight o'clock. Beu Chaque Medja is a tolerably large town, fituated on the well fide of a hill at the head of a fait lake about four miles long, which has communication with the fea. Here too is a Hone bridge, and a caufe-way about a quarter of a mile long between the lake and the fea. Nearly oppofite to Beu Chaque Medja , on the Eaft fide of a hill, is a fmall neat town called Callitratta, behind which are many vineyards, and on the fea before the town were feveral fmall veilels riding at anchor. We left this place at half pafl nine o'clock, and continued along the fhore, fometimes240 a journey from india, fometimes on the beach; and at about fix miles weft of Beu Chaque Medja we came to four villages lying nearly equidif- tant from each other, two being inland, and two near the fhore. The firft we came to is called Comburgus . It is a fmall village, but has many ruins about it, which imply that it has once been of more importance than it is at prefent. Continuing our route along the beach fix mifes further, we reached a very neat town called Badus . Here is a confider- able building Handing on the beach, having part of its walls walhed by the fea. It is a fquare ftru^lure and very lofty; the whole is built entirely with hewn ftone, has been very well finifhed, and ftill remains almoft entire. Soon after we left Badus , w r e crofled fome hills, whence we had a very fine profpecfc over the fea. The wind being wefterly, there were about a dozen (hips, befide great numbers of Imaller craft, going towards Constantinople . Within thetowards england. 2^1 the iilands alfo there were three Turki/h ihips of war returning from a cruize, a filly gun Ihip, a frigate, and a corvette. Thefe veflels were warping out of the har bour the morning I arrived at C onstan tinople. We continued our journey along the ihoie lor near eight miles, leaving on our right a very finely cultivated country, which flopes gradually down to the fca. After pafsing. many vineyards and orchards tor about a mile, we arrived at K illee- ver at half pall two o'clock. K illeever ' is a large and populous town, which has once been well forti fied, a great part of it being ftill fur- rounded by a ftrong walh Some of the molques and minarets are very handfome buildings. The lower part of th^ town is waflied by the fea. We faw feveral ve/Tels, foine of about two hundred tons burden, riding at anchor in a very line bay, which * Sili vria in the Maps. » R appeared24-2 a journey from india, appeared to me to be fo well fheltered by the high land on each fide of it, that {hips might, in any weather, ride in fafety. sunday, august 27. From Killeever we fet out at three o'clock this morning, and journied about eight miles along the fea-ihore, fometimes on the beach. We then turned to oui right, and, quitting the fea-coaft, palled over an open country, with little cultiva tion and few inhabitants. The fir ft village we came to was Connyclue , where we arrived at half pait fix o clock, and re mained an hour to refrelh. After leaving Connyclue , we came acrofs a very dreary | country, in which not a tree nor a ftone was to be feen. The foil is very white, but is neither clay nor fand; and what little vegetation there is, is nearly de- flroyed by innumerable quantities ot ground fquirrels. Theto wards exgland&gt; 24.3 • The fir ft figns of cultivation we met with were the vineyards belonging to a town called Chouroe, and which are near three miles long. At Chouroe we anived about ten o clock, and remained an hour, when we purfued our route over an open barren country. About ei'/ht • i % miles beyond Chouroe we crofted a nvcr, over which is a bridge of fifty arches, all built with hewn ftone, and neatly turned. So many arches, however, did not appear by any means neceftary at prefent, as there was not a great body of water in the river. We now entered a country poftefsin^ higher cultivation and more inhabitants, and turned about a quarter of a mile out o( our road, to feed our horfes at a town called Carrastran. In a deep narrow valley near this town were three lofty ftone pillars, which, I was informed, were to fupport pipes for conveying water ^crofs the valley to the town. R 2 We \A JOURNEY FROM INDIA, We only relied half an hour re, and then continued our route. Little variation occurred in the lace of the country till we arrived in the neighbourhood of Borgas , which we reached at halt palt fix o'clock. Here our profpe6t was much enlivened by the appearance of a neat town, and trees interfperfed about the furrounding country; for we had not ieen any, except a few fruit trees, fince we left the fea-coaft. MONDAY, AUGUST 28. T his morning we fet out from H orgas at four o'clock, and foon after we lelt the town entered a large toreft, in which we continued for about twenty miles without feeing either habitation or culture, till wc reached a fmall village called A ssibaly. From this place to K irkleesan , about four miles, the whole way is covered with vineyards. Wetowards england. 245 We arrived at Kirkleesan at ten o'clock. This is a very large and popu lous town, having ten mofqucs and mina rets, and feveral hummums. All the public buildings are of hewn Hone and marble, and lome of them very handfome. Here we procured frefh horfes, having conti nued upon the others all the way from Constantinople. At twelve o'clock we fet out from Kirkleesan , and foon entered a very woody hilly country, which abounded with fine marble. Being on freih horfes we rode brifkly, and at three o'clock ar rived at a fmall village called ErtcIee, around which there was a little cultiva tion, the lirlt we had met with iince we palled the vineyards of Kirkleesan. We did not flop here, however, but continued our route without miy delay till half pall four, when we arrived at a vil lage called Can area , where we put up at a Greek's houfe to refrefh. The Greeks arc a very civil obliging people, and our R 3 hoft245 A journey from india, hoft brought us out the beft refrefhments he had in the houfe. In thefe fmall villages there are very few Turks, and it there be one, it is aim oft certain that he is a barber; but he will ftrut about and aflume as much con- fequence as a baftiaw. I had frequently ob- ferved thefe great men in the little villages we paffed through, and, on enquiry, was generally informed that they were barbers. This made me rather more atten tive to the anions of the one we met with in this village, who, after giving the falam in great fprin, came to converle with my Janizary. I was enabled ever afterwards to diftinguilh thefe important perfonages. We only remained here half an hour, and then continued our journey thiough fome very thick woods. At halt paft feven o'clock we reached a village called F accue , where we changed horfes, and fet out again at half paft eight. The »whole of our road was through a clofe wood till we arrived at a town called K arrapoonar , which we reached at halt; paft twelve o'clock. / * ' $ ■ Thetowards england, 24' f The diftance from K irkjleesan to Faccue is thirty-fix miles, and from thenee to Karrapoonar fifteen. tuesday, august 29. From Karrapoonar we fet out at four o'clock. For the firft two hours our road was through very thick woods, and I obferved that our route had been nearly due North ever fince we left the fea-coaft. At eight o'clock we arrived at a village called Benlee , where we llopt half an hour at a Greek's houfe to refrefh. The mailer of the houfe had two very beau-' tiful daughters. The Greeks in general have handfome features; but thefe parti cularly attraelcd my attention. They, as well as the peafantry in general, had a very ridiculous cullom of tying all their treafure round their necks; and I have ac tually feen fome w r ear three or four hundred Venetian fequins perforated and R 4 faftenedsh8 a journey from india, faftened round their necks with filk firings. This cudom, however, is confined to the unmarried part of the fex, wives having no ornament whatever on that part ot' their pcrfons. An arm of the Black Sea reaches within two miles of Benlee , which in part feparates Romalia from Bulgaria. After we left Benlee the country had a- better appearance, exhibiting a great deal of cultivation all the way to Idos, which we reached at ten o'clock. It abounded with fine cattle, all milk-white except their ears and the end of the tail, which were brown ; there were alfo many buffaloes. Idos is a tolerably large town, and pleafantly fituated. Many of the houfes are built within a compound, fimilar to thofe of the Bramins and Nairs in India, which makes the town at a diftance appear much larger than it really is. Thetowards england. 249 The peafantry here feparate the corn from the ftraw by the fame method as in Asia Minor , and which I have obferved to be adopted in all countries where the rains are periodical. They make a ring about forty yards round, fometimes of clay, and fometimes paved. They then bring their corn from the field, and throw it in a heap in the middle of the ring. They have a Hedge too, which is fome times drawn by bullocks, fometimes by horfes, and fome of thefe have pieces of iron driven into the bottom to cut the llraw as it goes round; though in others I have feen flint Hones fuliened to the bottom. Upon the fledge is a heavy weight. Beiide the perfon who drives the cattle, another is employed with a fork in tofsing the ftraw from the ring if the grain is extradled, and taking frefh from the heap in the middle. In this manner they are enabled to continue till they have extracted the whole of their corn, without being in any danger of having it fpoiled by rain. This is much quicker250 A journey from india, quicker, and eafier too, than our mode of thrafhing in England. As the weather in England is local, perhaps more fo than in any other part of the world, and cannot be depended upon manv days together, might notthofe who have large farms and extenfive buildings follow a fimilar plan, or even build Iheds, which would anfwer as well, and abate much of the very heavy labour of thralh- ing ? By this mode they would alfo fave time, and confequently be better able to attend to the cultivation and improvement of their lands. We fet out from Idos at twelve o'clock on frefh horfes; and at two miles beyond the town entered an extenfive loreft, in which we continued till feven o'clock, when we eroded a pretty ample river called Derra , and arrived at a fmail town - named Cheng a near its banks. Thetowards england, 251 The road through the foreft was fome- times very bad. We,followed the bed of a river for an hour, which was rough and rocky, and the horfcs were fometimes in danger. Though we were frequently near the Black Sea , the trees were fo very thick that 1 had not often an opportunity qf feeing it; yet we were fometimes with in two hundred yards of the beach, and faw a Ihip (landing towards Constanti nople. The foreft in many places has the underwood cleared away to encourage the growth of the oaks; and there being a great many of thefe, and fome very tine timber among them, from their vicinity to the fea they may be fliipped with little trouble. * . wednesday, august 30. We fet out from Chenga at four o'clock, and after pafsing a little cultiva tion near the town entered another thick foreft,252 a journey from india, forcft, which led 'us to a village called Enechee , after crofsing a river bearing the fame name about eight miles from Chenga. We foon came, to another foreft, in which we continued till we arrived near Pravadee , which we reached at feven o'clock. Pravadee is a large and well inha bited town, containing many very good buildings. It is fituatcd in a narrow vale running N. and S. between two lleep rocky lulls. We remained here an hour to refrefh and change horfes. Afcending the hill on the weftern fide, we had a line profpeft ot the furrounding country, and on the top ot the hill on the eaft fide of Pravadee is another large town called Disdarchue. ' We now entered a fine country, and pafled through a great many villages in high cultivation, and abounding in or- 2 chardstowards england. 255 chards and vineyards. Mofl kinds ot fruit were now ripe, in great plenty, and very cheap, as were likewife provifions of all kinds. Our road lay now more Weft, and we paffed through a remarkably line country in the neighbourhood of a town called Chelepcha , twenty miles V/eft from Pravadee. On leaving Chelepcha we palled a village on our right called Madara ; then rode acrofs an extenfive plain for twelve miles, and at three o'clock arrived at Chumloo. This is a very populous town, and, though not regularly fortified, is ot great natural flrength from its fituation, having a fteep mountain behind the town, forming a femicircle, on which the 1 urks have planted feveral batteries of cannon. During the late war a confiderable Rufsian army appeared in the plains belore this254 a journey from india, this town, and defeated the Turkifh forces. The latter retreated into the town, and threw up a mud wall with a iolie and paling before the town, and up each fide of the mountain. [This temporary forti fication ft ill remains entire.] As the Rufsian army approached the town, the Turks played upon them from their bat teries on the mountain. The Rufsians here lofl their General and retreated. On the weftern fide of the mountain is a thick foreft which is perfectly inaccefsi- ble to an army. We left Chum loo at five o'clock on frefli horfes, and, travelling weftward through a well cultivated country, came at twelve o'clock to a large town called Arnootka , fituated in a valley. At one we reached Rasgrat ; and this is reckon ed thirty-two miles from Chumloo. thursday,towards england. 255 thursday, august 31. A t half pall: fix we let out from R as - grat on frefh horfcs, and at eight o'clock flopped an hour to refrelh at a village called U chencha. We now rode for near forty miles through one of the fineft countries 1 had yet feen, with corn and ploughed land on each lide as far as the eye could reach. At fix o'clock we arrived at R ochuke, but could not fee the town till we were within half a mile of it, being fituated on the banks of the D anube at the foot of a hill, which continues for feveral miles near the D anube , and is covered with vine yards. R ochuke is a large populous town about the fize of L iverpool . We did not, however, flop here, but crofied the D anube , and landed about three miles below256 a journey from india, below on the oppofite fide, at a town called Ergnoff . The Danube is here an ample river, but does not appear to me fo large as either the Euphrates or Ti gris. We refrefhed at Ergnoff , and waited near two hours for horfes and carts, in which we were conveyed to a village called Copuchen , where we arrived at eleven o'clock. On enquiry, I found that this was the manner in which I was to travel through Wallachia . Thefe poft carts are light, and run very eafy upon four wheels. They have not, either about the cart or the horfes furniture, the fmalleft particle of iron or other metal whatever. The horfes are Imall, but run very faft; for we travelled, upon an aver age, rather quicker than by the mail coaches in England. friday,towards england. 257 i friday, september 1* M r E fet out this morning at fix oVlock. I had one poft-cart with three horfes, and my Janizary another with the fame num ber. We met with no cultivation till nine o'clock, when we reached a village called Calligurran , where we break- faftcd and remained till half pall ten. We then refumed our journey through a very fine country, though little culti vated. The foil, however, appears well adapted for culture, being a ftrong brown earth, very even, and not a ftone to be feen the natural produce of the place. At twelve o'clock we crofled a large river called Arjects over a bridge of boats made faft by a cable. Loofe pieces of Wood, half fquared, were laid athwart the boats, which made it very difagree- ble crofsing. We then continued our r oute through a fine country in which S little1&gt;58 a journey from india, little corn was grown, except maize, and at three o'clock reached Bukarest , the capital of AVallachia , and the refidence 1 of the IIospodar. I now made ufe of the letters of intro duction which I had received from tlie Imperial Minifter Baron Herbert ttk Rathkaal at Constantinople to M, de Merkelius , the Imperial Gonful Ge neral here; from whom I received the greateil civilities, and at vvhofc houfe 1 remained till Monday the 4th, He politely took me in his carriage all round the environs ol Bukarest , and oave me eVery information that I coukl wilh rcfpe6ling the country. Bukarest is a very extenfive and po pulous city, containing three hundred and lixty Greek churches, one Roman and one Lutheran chapel, and a few convents.

There is much intrigue carried on in the higher claffes, particularly among the married people. A man never fees his in tended bride till they exchange rings, a ceremony that takes place a few days be fore the marriage; for the parents or guardians of both parties make up the match without alking the confent of cither. In a very fhort time after the marriage ceremony the parties generally difcontinue Deeping together, each carrying on their refpe&lt;5tive intrigues. The ladies ufually keep their feparate carriages, as a coach, with a proper equipage, is commonly a part of the marriage portion. S 2 The unmarried youngmrmmm 260 a journey from india, young ladies, however, are kept up as clofe as in a nunnery, and are not per mitted to keep company with any men whatever until the ceremony of exchang ing rings with their intended hufbands has taken place. I believe there are few people in the world, particularly among thofe who call themfelves Chriltians, that make more protefsions of religion than thefe people, and in reality have lefs. In fome of the churches here they have prayers continu ally from morning till night, and thefe are chaunted as in Catholic chapels. Their language is harmonious', fome- thing refembling the Greek, and indeed has feveral Greek charaders in it, Wallachia poflefies in general a rich foil, but is rather woody. In the greateil part of the province there is fcarcely a hill or Hone the natural produce ot the country. Their corn is chiefly maize, ot whichtowards england. J 261 which they have a great quantity; yet good wheaten bread is to be had in the larger towns. Provifions of all kinds are very cheap; and I bought a fine fowl for fix Turkifli parra, value about three halfpence llerling. The inhabitants in general are Greeks, and they have not many foreigners among them. In the larger towns, however, there are fome Jews and a few Germans. They ere^ crucifixes near the roads; fome of thefe are of Hone, but they are chiefly made of wood. All, however, are painted; fome having Jesus Christ, fome the Virgin Mary, others the Twelve Apoftles, fome the Ten Command ments, prayers, &amp;c. depicted on them. Thefe crucifixes are very numerous, and moft of the country people make their obedience as they pafs them. The province is well watered; the bridges arc all built with wood ; but they S 3 have2g2 a journey from india, have a very ridiculous cuftom of laying loofe pieces of half-fquared timber acrofs the bridges, which frequently give way under the horfes feet. monday, september 4-.

J had brought letters from M. de M erkelius to the Director of the L azaretto, however, which proved of much fervice; for I was in confequence particularly attended to, had a fervant appointed to wait on me, and was fupplied with plenty of the beft provifions, wine, and fruits. When at C onstantinople, I wifhed much to come through S ervia and B el grade, and to perform quarantine at SiiMLiN, but was induced to decline comingtowards england. 2f)5 coming that route on being informed, that 1 fhould be detained thirty days; whereas by this route I fhould only be delayed ten days by the quarantine. This route alfo being appointed by the Germans for con- dueling the poll, I experienced no other detention whatever; in the other, I fhould have been liable to many delays. ftS) My Janizary and myfelf had travelled fo fail as actually to keep in company with the pofl till after we crofled the Danube, when I found myfelf fo much fatigued that I preferred remaining alf nisfht to O £5 continuing with the pofl any longer. I have often had the vanity to think that I was as able to endure fatigue and hard- fliips as moll men, always enjoying a good flrong conftitution, and from choice having been accuHomed to live tempe rately; but 1 have had experience enough to know, that I mud fubmit to the Turks, whofe patience and perfeverance in per- iorming the longell journies exceed all belief. From266 a journey from india, From the niglit of the 25th Augull to the evening of the 3111, I had travelled fix hundred and feventy-two Englifh miles, as will appear by the following diftances, given me by M. de, M erkelius , the Di- re£tor of the Poll, and qn whofe know ledge and veraejty I may have peried dependence. Ctfinan Ppjtf* From Constantinople to Rochuke on the Danube , through Rom alia and Bulgaria 50 From Erguoff on the Danube to Bukarest ^ 56; which, reckoning 12 Englifh miles to a German poft, is 672 miles. The latter has been accurately afcer- tained by the German engineers, who had the conducting of artillery to Erguoff m the late war. On the 14th September my quarjintinp expired, the day on which I arrived being reckonedtowards england, $67 Reckoned as one, bccaufe I was there be- fj^re fun-fet. As lliere was no carriage ready, the Dire&lt;5lor recommended me to wait till the following morning, the port being e?;pe6led at fix o'clock. After breakfafting with the Director, who made jnany apologies for not attending me fetter, being prevented from having any communication, I made his two chil dren a prefent, and took my leave, per- fe6Uy fajtisfied with his condii(5L I fet out in the poft-cart, a carriage built on purpofe, and with better accom modations and more conveniencies than the Wallachian; though both are very Jig!?'' Our roacj for the fir |l fix miles was nea^: the banks of the river Alauta, with very high hills and thick woods on each /ide. There are many fteep narrow pafles Jiere, but juft broad enough for the car riage, and which have been cut out of ]the folid rocks. At268 a journey from india, ' At B oetziiar all my paflports, and certificates of having performed the qua rantine, were examined. After getting through thofe pafTes we entered a fine open country, in which nu merous villages and fome eonfiderable towns were to be feen, and the gi cater part of tbe whole was cultivated. At eleven o'clock we arrived at II err- manstadt, the capital ol 1 rans\l- vania. Here I delivered the letter which I had brought from the Imperial Minifter at C onstantinople to the General Com mandant of the province, who behaved very politely, and made me welcome at his houfe. He entertained a very high opinion of the Englifh, (by whofe troops he had once been taken prifoner when in F landers) but knew very little ot the language; for he often repeated all that he knew of it, which were only two words, the common exprefsion in Iweai- o ing,towards england. ing, which he faid he learned while a pri- foner. The paflports I had received from the Imperial Minifter at C onstantinople (for what purpofe I cannot fay) mentioned that I was a bachelor, which the General obferving, he wished me much to marry a German, faying that they had plenty of very handfome women, and that if I would fix upon any one, he would pledge himfelf that I /hould not meet with a re- fulal in the whole province. H errmanstadt is a tolerably well built city. The promenade is very pleafant, and they have alfo a very hand fome theatre. Their mulic is excellent, having the advantage of fome of the fir ft German performers. The people are very polite, and obferve much formality; for no perfon above the rank of a fervant can walk in the flreets without a fvvord by his fide. They arp alfo very particular in their dreffes; and a native of the province wears a drefs Similar to what was worn in England270 a journey from indta^ E ngland upwards ot a hundrect yeafjj ago, viz, a long coat almoft reaching to the ground, trimmed all round with iur; a pair of boots like thofe ol' our hea\^ cavalry, with a cocked hat fomething like a Dutch Ikipper's. People from every province are known here by their refpec- tive drelics ; and even every tradefman is diltinguifhed by his apparel. Whoever vidts this city, il he can fparc two hours, fhould not ncgle6t feeing Baron B rukenthal's extenfive collcdion of the moll valuable paintings, many of vC 'hich are by the firfl malters, G uido, R ubens, R embrant, &amp;:c. His antique coins, medals, and other curiofities, alfo are well worth feeing. His library is very extenfive, and coniidered ot great value. He has likewife a beautiful garden about half a mile out of the city, laid out after the Englilh talle. The Baron is almoft 80 years of age; he was many years Civil Governor ot this pro- vincc, and fpeaks Englifti tolerably well. T han-toWARDS england. zh I ra K sylvania is, generally fpeakin^ a fine country, but capable of much im provement. It produces great quantities ol moft kinds of grain, and flax of a very good quality, which is mamifa6lured into' linen# The nobility arc for the moft part rery proud, and keep their peafantry in a ftatc of flavery; for out of fix days in the week the peafant is obliged to labour four toi his mafter, having only the remaining two days for himfelf. r rhi-s province pays to the Emperor in taxes of all kinds 1,500,000 florins annu ally, which is chiefly impofed upon the land, for what the citizens pay is very trifling indeed. I bought at H errmanstadt a carriage ot that kind called a calafli, being much more commodious than the common polt- earts, as in cafe ot rain the pafl'engers can throw the calaih over them for ihelter, 3 They272 a journey FROM INDIA, They run upon four wheels, and are very eafy in their motion. Be fide the letters to the General Commandant, I had others to Hadjee ******, a banker, who introduced me to two Greek merchants that were going to Vienna , and recommended me ' to take them in my carriage. As they were acquainted with the language, I agreed to it, and on the 18th September we fet out from Herrmanstadt. We travelled pofi:, and without any delay, by day and night, till we arrived at Temeswar , the capital of Banate, where we were detained a tew hours to have our paflports examined. This being a ftrong fortification, the officers were very particular in examining all ftrangers, and I was obliged to go before the General Commandant, with whom 1 converfed in Latin. When informed that 1 was an Englifhman he fhewed me much atten tion. The&lt;§j TOWARDS ENGLAND. 273 The B anate is a very fine province, the greater part of it being level and well cultivated, except on that fide adjoining to 1 ransylvania , which is mountainous and woody. Provifions ot all kinds arc good and cheap; and their wines are excellent, par ticularly at a large town called L ugos. Ine two Greek merchants, my compa nions, continued to pay on the road, and f obferved them frequently endeavouring to cheat the poll maftcrs and poftilions. When we flopped at an inn too, they be haved very ihabbily. I conlidered myfelf difgraccd by fuch condud; but when at laii they even attempted to impofe upon me, I thought it high time to break off all connection with them, which I did immediately on our arrival at P est. This condiidl in the Greek merchants confirmed the opinion I had always en tertained of thofe people, who may be laid to be in a degraded Hate, and T whofe- 2 274 a journey from india, whofe flag is not refpedled by oilier na tions. It might be thought illiberal to enumerate the various nations and people whofe condu6l fhould be watched with a jealous eye; in Asia, however, I may mention the Armenian; in Europe, the Greeks and Jews. I have witnefled the low chicanery of the two lormer, and I believe we have here almofl daily proofs of the latter. On the contrary, I have obferved, that whenever the flag ot any nation is refpedled, the people ot that na tion conduct themfelves in a manner that will at all times command refpedt. Ihcie confiderations convince me, how much every individual ought to confider himfeli interefted in fupporting the dignity ol his national character. Pest is at.prefent the capital of the kingdom of Hungary. It is a large and populous city, and has been much im proved within the laft fix years, great part of the city having been entirely re built. It is feated on the 4eft banks ol the Danube. On, towards england. 275 On the oppofite fide of the river is the city ot O ffen, nearly as large as P est, and remarkable for its exeellent wines, which are held in much efteem all over the Empire. O ffen is fituated on the fide of a hill facing the South, which is covered with vineyards lor about fix miles below the city. Ihe wine is red and fomething like port, but has a ftronger body and is very rough. We have a profpedt of fome of this wine reaching E ngland, as they are now cutting a canal from V ienna to T rieste, f On the river D anube below P est, are many floating corn-mills, which are ad mirably adapted for the purpofe. The veflbls on which the mills are built are al ways kept alioat, and at anchor, in the middle ol the llream; the wheel is turned by the current; and 1 am of opinion, that mills built on a fimilar conllruCfion might be made ferviceable on the river T hames, T 2 without276 a journey from india, without obftrii(5Hng the navigation ; for we have too many inftances oi Hour and bread advancing in price, on account ot the mills in the neighbourhood not being able to raife a fufficient fupply, particu larly in dry feafons. On the 25th September at four in the afternoon, fet out from Pest , and ar rived at Vienna at 12 o'clock at night. The road was in general tolerably good, and I travelled about as quick as does the mail coach in England.- At Vienna I remained nearly three weeks, being much tatigued with the journey; and during my l^ay 1 received many civilities trom Sir Morton Kden (now Lord Henley ) the Britifo Minifter. On the 12th October I left Vienna, coming through Bohemia , and remain ing two days at Prague to take a view oi the city and its environs. Leavingtowards england. 277 Leaving Prague I came on to Dres den, the capital of Saxony, where I re mained two days, and did not eonfider my time mis-fpent. There is a degree of ele gance in this city and the neighbourhood, fuperior to any thing that I have elfewhere feen. The gallery is fuppofed to contain the largeft and befl collection of paintings in Europe, and it had lately received coniiderable additions; for, on the French entering Italy, many of the bell pieces were conveyed to Dresden, as a place of fafety. After leaving Dresden, I travelled through Leipsick, Halle, IIalber- stadt, Brunswick-Lunenburg, and to Hamburgh, which I reached on the evening of the 28th Oclober, Printed hy g.
