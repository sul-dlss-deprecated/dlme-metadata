The Procurator of Tangier Court has now asked, through H.M. Consul General, for information about the circumstances in which the releasjtaff took place, and it transpires that the Government of Sind exercised their powers under Section 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the concurrence of the Tangier authorities not being obtained in view of the fact that the administration of the territory had been taken over by Spain (without the recognition of H.M.G.). The Govern ment of India consider that the proper course would have been for the Government of Sind to refer the case for orders ’ to H.M.G. , but that it is impossible to revoke the release, which was unconditional, and that it only remains to provide the Tangier Administration with the information requested by them.

The position with regard to remission of sentence in this case is set out in Foreign Office despatch No. 121 of the 14th May 1935 to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tangier, copy of which was enclosed in Foreign office letter 3691/1063/28 of the 18th May 1935.

Lord Zetland will observe from Mr. Keeling*s despatch No. 275 of the 19th December 1938 that the Sultan of Morocco may be prepared to consider representations from His Majesty*s Government for a reduction of Rarachand Tarachand*s term of imprisonment. 3. I am accordingly to suggest that, if Lord Zetland sees no objection, a statement of the Government of India*s case as regards the desirability of remission of sentence should be forwarded to this Department in order that instructions may be issued to His Majesty*s Consul-General at Tangier to take the necessary steps to obtain the favourable consideration of the Sultan of Morocco.

I am also informed privately that the Court has recoraraended its rejection. 2. Signor Marchegiano also added that whereas the 1 Sultan would be obliged to reject the present petition he | ight nevertheless be prepared to consider a reduction of fc&lt;! M , ,, M the term of Imprisonment especially if such a reduction Hire provided for in the Indian prison regulations. It *8, therefore, for His Majesty*s Government to consider whether they wished to bring any pressure to bear on His i hereefian Majesty in this sense. 3. With reference to Foreign Office despatch No. 163 (W 4802/1063/28) of 13th June 1936, I would add that Tarachand's accomplice, a Spaniard, who was condemned to 16 years imprisonment and was confined at the Valencia prison when the Spanish war broke out is believed to have been at liberty for some time, but in view of the conditions obtaining in that country it does not aeera that any useful action can be taken in the matter, although the fact has been brought to the notice of the Committee of Control.

In his despatch under reference Mr. Gardener stated that in agreeing to the transfer of the prisoner from Gibraltar to India, the Tangier Administration had made it a condition that no measure which would have the effect of reducing the prisoner’s sentence could be taken save through His Majesty the Sultan. In reply to this condition Mr. Gardener stated: 'Mon Gouvernement est dispose h admettre qu’il ne saurait etre question dans ce cas de mesures de grace en faveur du condamne sauf a la requete ou avec 1’ agrement des autorit^s du territoire d’ofc emane la condamna- tion. M 3. In view of the steps at present contemplated by the Superintendent of the Karachi District prison, I venture to suggest that the above condition should be brought to the notice of the Government of India. 4. With regard to the penultimate paragraph of the Assistant Administrator’s letter, I have the honour to explain that petitions for mercy have recently been made by the family of the prisoner. These were addressed to His Majesty The Sultan and are at present under consideration by the Mixed Court, in accordance with Article 11 of the Judicial Dahir/ His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, FOREIGN 0‘FICE.

From this you will observe that although the Tangier Administration were not prepared to make any contribution towards the cost of the transfer of Ramchand Tarachand to India, they agreed to continue payment of the prisoner’s subsistence allowance at the rate of 5 francs a day. fh, OhJmm. u* runuxS Ufa *(§) Minute Paper. p. z. 4750/37 Department. Ramchand Tarachand, who had he'oi sentenced to life imprisonment by the mixed court at Tangier in 1931 for murder, was transferred, together with another prisoner, G-opaldas Kewalram Laraee, to the Karachi District Prison in July 1936. (The last paper on t he subject of the transfer which we have on the file is Colonial Office letter dated 18th July, 1936, P.Z. 5165 ; apparently the Government of India did not notify their safe arrival to us). The Government-of Ind&gt;a havo now sent to the High Commissioner a bill expenses incurred on account of the maintenance of prisoners belonging to the Gibraltar State during the year ended 31st March 1937. The bill apparently refers to Ramchand Tarachand only - not Gopaldas Kewalram Laraee. The High Commissioner questions whether any amount can be claimed for the maintenance of the transfer, i n view of the papers forwarded with our letter P.~i. 3396/36 dated hth June, 1936, in which it was stated that the Tangier Administrator had refused to incur any expenses in connection with the transfer* (Covering letter and enclosure referred to are both flagged B). Examination of the file, however, shows that this refusal referred only to the expenses of the actual -ransier. In the course of earlier correspondence the iangier Administration had agreed to continue to conuribute at the rate of p francs a day towards the maintenance of Ramchand Tarachand in India. (This is clear from paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Administrator’s letter to the Foreign Office dated 4th April 1936, P.Z. 2586 / 36 , flagged E).

Arrangements have been made for prisoners and escort to be accommodated in the Anchor Line s.s.Castalia, due to leave Gibraltar on the 29th July and to reach Bombay on the 1 8 th August, and both the escorting officers will journey to Gilbraltar in the same ship, embarking at Liverpool on the 24th July . This is the only ship in which the requrFTd passages could be obtained* 2 * It is presumed that all the necessary instructions in regard to their taking over and handing over the prisoners and their duties as escort will be communicated direct to the two officers by the India Office.

Both Messrs.Beddow and Baldwin were due to resume duty this month on return from leave, the former on the 21st July and the latter on the 25th July, and their leave has in each case been extended with the concurrence of their respective Governments (obtained by telegram) to the 17th August. Mr.Beddow had already booked his return passage to India by the Anchor Line s.s.'Brittania', which sailed from Liverpool on the 27th June, and it is not anticipated that the transfer of his passage to s.s. 'Castalia' will result in any additional expenditure. Mr.Baldwin had however arranged to return by P &amp; 0 and as he stipulated that he should not be put to extra travelling expense on his journey to India, a stipulation that the High Commissioner could not in the circumstances regard as unreasonable, it has been agreed to give Mr.Baldwin the Anchor line passage on the 'Castalia' (cost £35) in exchange for his return P &amp; 0 coupon, the refund value of which is being obtained and credited to Government. The extra cost to be borne by Government will probably be not more than some £13*10 and not less than £7*10, according to whether the P &amp; 0 Co. are prepared or not to waive the cancellation charge.

The agreed gratuity of £15 each will be paid to the two officers by this Office before*they embark. 5 . 1 am to add that the Anchor Line require a/ r-\r2 a letter of indemnity in connection with the carriage of the prisoners and the High Commissioner proposes, if the Secretary of State sees no objection, to comply* gU , -Mj.

To The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London, S.W.l Sir, The undersigned is the wife of Bhai Ramchand Tarachand. In your letter No. 40/3236/37/28 dated 21st April 1936, you were pleased to write that my husband who is now at Gibraltar was being transferred to Karachi. I was shocked to read the letter being in reply to my petition that his sentence may be remitted or reduced. 1 immediately sent the following cablegram:- 'Received No. 3236/37/28 kindly don*t effect transfer Karachi or India otherwise ruining my husband sending petition Sati Ramchand”. Your goodself must have received the cablegram and I sincerely hope that you have stayed further progress in this direction. My reasons are as follows: My husband Ramchand belonged to a very high class family of Sind Work Merchants of Hyderabad Sind. His conviction, as it was, threw a very gloomy doud over the whole family for a number of years and for a long time it was a talk of the town. I would not wish that the old wounds should revive and the whole family might undergo another period of torment and anguish if he is sent to any Indian Prison. 2. The prisons in India are a death place for the people of his status. The life therein is indeed very hard and a person who has enjoyed a comfortable life in the past cannot survive so much as a period of a month without complete loss of health and character. It is needless for me to dwell longer on this point, as you must also be familiar/familiar with it from several reports of the horrors of the Jail life in a backward Country like ours. 3 . I would sincerely pray that before you make any decision you would bring home to my husband, the implications of the transfer as pointed out by me and consult his wishes in the matter. 1 shall ever pray for long life and prosperity of the British Empire. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, (sd.) Mrs.Sati Ramchand.

Sir, I have received a letter from a pupil of ours, Mrs.Sati Ramchand, asking me to request you very kindly to reconsider the transfer of her husband who is in jail in Gibraltar. She has an idea that he receives better treatment in a European jail. I hesitate to write this, as one cannot interfere v/ith Governments decisions. I am drawing the lady’s attention to the fact that, in the event of any trouble in Europe, her husband would be safer out here. If one did not write, these good people would think one was not willing to help. Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) R. Piggott (Miss).Uw&amp;cAY&amp;vx Le t o;al Ad 'j P.&amp; J. S . .ary, In agreeing to the transfer from Gibraltar to India of the Indian convict Ramchand Tarachand (who was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder by the mixed court at Tangier) the Tangier administration stipulated that no remission of his sentence would be granted, except by the Sultan of Morocco. In his reply, the Acting Consul-General at Tangier said that CX\'Q. H.Mi. G. j=c disposed to admit that there would not be any question of a remission, except at the request, or with the concurrence of the authorities of the territory in which sentence had been passed (P. Z. 2586/3fc). This statement by the Acting Consul-General was based on Foreign Office despatch of lUth May, 1935&gt; The Foreign Office made a similar statement in a letter to Mrs Ramchand of 21st April, The India Office were not consulted before any of these statements were made, but the Foreign Office now seek our concurrence in a reply to a telegram they/wmmmmm — 2 they have received from Krs Ramchand, in which they wish to say that the position regarding the remission of her husband’s sentence remains unaffected by his impending transfer to India. It is suggested that we should not agree to the '.rovernment of India’s hands being bound as rigidly as the Foreign Office contemplate, and a draft reply stating this view is attached. The Foreign Office have unfortunately committed themselves to the Tangier administration, and they would presumably have to consider whether, in the light of our view, any further communication to the Tangier administration is necessary. ^ ^ ^ Do you concur in the course proposed?Draft Paper POLITICAL Department DRAFT LETTER.

Both, for reasons of health, are to be transferred to India Ramchand to Karachi and District Prison, Gopaldas to Hyderabad Central Prison, Sind. The Government of India haseaccepted the transfer of both prisoners, and^ 18 ^ prepared to meet the cost of transport from Indian revenues (Government of India telegram of 24th February and Government of India telegram of 22nd April). Certain formalities are now being pursued - such as the signature of Notifications of Concurrence and of Warrants of Removal by the interested parties - but there is little reason to suppose that any hitch will occur. The question of providing an escort must therefore be considered, in order that no avoidable delay should arise. It is relevant in this connection that both men are ill, Gopaldas especially so. The Colonial Office have suggested that the prisoners could possibly be picked up at Gibraltar by a suitable officer (or officers) in the employment of the Government of India proceeding to India in a vessel calling at Gibraltar, who could escort the convicts to their new places of detention. Certainly this seems prime facie the best solution. I have therefore enquired v/hether any troop-ship was proceeding to India at this time of year, but understand there is none. I next obtained from India House a list of Inspectors and Sergeants of Police now on leave v/ho will be returning to India this summer: the list is flagged B on the file.

Your Highness Lady, VUith all due respect I moat earnestly beg of you to interfere on my behalf in order that you may mitigate in- part my precarious and unhappy predicament. I presume that your high oificial is very influential, but it is not my intention to divert you of your duties. The support X need so feverishly of you is utterly particular it being the case that through the influence of your esteemed acquaintance, support may be metea out to my unhappy husband who, through the bad company of a Spaniard was sentenced to life imprisonment by a mixed tribunal in Tangier. My petition has no precedent but the fact that I have two children justifies it. n order to disperse any doubts you may entertain I wish to acquaint you that my husband has no antecedent and his exemplary deportment and obedience was brought to the notice of the proper quarters. My husband^ name is Ramchand Tarachand and at present he has served six years at the Civ^l prison Gibraltar. I remain, etc., ( igned) Mrs. Jati Hamchand.Minute Paper. Sr il* 1 L Department. r \ 1 U 1 Ur ^ Please see the Minutes at P.Z.1355/36 and P.Z. 1856/36. The Order for the removal of the Indian convict Ramchand Tarachand has now been received from the Colonial Office with their letter of the 17th April. This Order embodies the amendments suggested in the India Office letter of 28th March, P.Z.1856/36. Article 4, section 3, of the Colonial Prisoners Removal Order in Council, 1907, lays down that 'the Governor of the Colony to which the prisoner is to be removed shall retain a copy of the Order of Removal and one copy of the Notification of Concurrence, which he shall attach to the Order of Removal, and shall se ni. the second copy of the Notification to the Governor of the Colony from which the prisoner is to be removed, and the third copy oi the Notification to a Secretary of State'. In the draft letter to the Government of India which is put up, it is requested that the Governor of Sind be instructed in this sense. The Colonial Office letter of the End-A^prll j enclosed a draft Order for the prisoner Gopaldas Laraee, and it is now requested that the colonial Office will make similar amendments to this draft Order ,as were made in the case of Ramchand Tarachand. It is also suggested that the contingencies contained in paragraph 4 of the Colonial Office letter of the 2nd April are too hypothetical to be considered at this stage. The Government of India in their telegram of the 22nd April state that they have no objection to the transfer of Laraee from Gibraltar to India. They recommend that he should be sent to Hyderabad Central Prison, Sind, and have agreed that the cost of his transport shall.be borne by Indian revenues. It seems, therefore, that it will be possible/ 4424 5000 1/36d s possible, for these two prisoners to be removed to India at the same time. The provision of an escort, however, offers some difficulties. One suggestion was that the two men could be picked up by a troop ship, but I understand that this is the wrong season for such a solution. Perhaps the best way is lor one (or more) Indian policeman, returning to India after leave in this country, of either the Inspector or Sergeant rank, to pick up the prisoners at Gibraltar and to escort them to their destinations, receiving in return full pay and passage from the Government of India. It seems unlikely that the Government of India will object to this, which is an essential part of the prisoners* transport and which, indeed, seems to be the most economical means of securing an escort.

I am directed by tne secretary of State for India to refer to the Colonial Office letter of the 2nd Aftfil, No.88525/ 36, and connected correspondence r egardmg Gopaldas Kewalram Laraee, who is serving a sentence of imprisonment at Gibraltar. P 2- A copy of the Government of Indian telegram of the 22nd April, No.F.66/3 t 6- Jails, was sent to the Colonial Office under India Office printed letter of the 23rd April, No.P.Z.2758/36. 2. The Marquess of Zetland agrees to the transfer at the cost of Indian revenues of Gopaldas Laraee under the Colonial Prisoners’ Removal Act, 1884, from Gibraltar to the Hyderabad Central Prison, Sind. His Lordship suggests tnat, in view of the concluding sentence of section 2 of tnis Act with regard to the removal of a prisoner to any British possession, which is defined in section 18, and also ov/ing to the fact tnat Sind is the Province to which Gopaldas Laraee is to be removed, paragraph 3 of the draft Order enclosed in Colonial Office letter of 2nd April might be amended to read:- 'Now I do hereby in pursuance of the Colonial Prisoners’ Removal Act, with the concurrence of the Govern ment of the said Colony and the Governor of the Province of Sind in 4599 5000 2.36 India/India, order that tne said Gopaidas Kewalram Laraee 'be removed to the said Province of Sind, tnere to undergo tne residue of his said sentence 11 . 3. The Marquess of Zetland notes that if Gopaidas Laraee is removed to India under the Colonial Prisoners’ Removal Act, and if he is subsequently discharged therei at tne expiry of his three years sentence, he will be entitled under Section 3, sub section 2, of this Act (if he so desires) to be sent bach to Gibraltar free of cost. Lord Zetland notes, however, that in view of the facts that the prisoner is a native of Hyderabad, Sind, where it is understood, that he has relatives living, and that he J is a man of some age and ill health, there is no great likelihood of his desiring to return to Gibraltar, and he suggests that the contingencies set out in paragraph 4 -F of your letter of tne tod-Aprl-l need not be considered unless and until they arise. 4. The Marquess of Zetland contemplates arranging for the conveyance of Gopaidas Laraee to India at the same time as the convict Ramchand Tarachand (vide the correspondence resting with Colonial Office letter of 17th April, No.88559/36) proceeds there. The Colonial Office will be informed as soon as possible of the detailed arrangements contemplated. 5.

He was sentenced on the 23rd January 1935 by the Chief Justice of Gibraltar sitting at Msfifakesh to penal servitude for three years for having assaulted and wounded a Moorish Jew. He was transferred to Gibraltar to serve his term of imprisonment. The Government of India accepted responsibility for the cost of his transfer and maintenance at Gibraltar (P.Z.9337/35). 2. Laraee is an old man aged 68 years, and his health has now become so bad that the prison authorities fear that he may die on their hands. The Foreign Office have therefore asked us to transfer him to India as in the case of Eamchand Tarachand (a second Indian British convict who is also detained at Gibraltar). The legal backing for the transfer can once again be the Colonial Prisoners Removal Act 1884, and it would be most convenient for Laraee to be escorted to India at the same time as Ramchand. A draft air mail letter to India in this sense is suggested. 3. The Colonial Office in their letter of the 7th March (written before they received our communication) have raised the question of the actual passage and escort of Ramchand. It will perhaps be better to defer consideration of this problem until we have heard from India whether they have any objection to receiving Laraee. |i-K av K-o ^The two convicts could then be escorted in the same boat and by the same guard. ^ C* 0 .

The Foreign Office proposed that Ramchand parachand, the Indianvjho is imprisoned in Gibraltar under a life sentence^ awarded by the Mixed Court at Tangier, should be transferred to India under the Colonial Prisoners Removal Act, 1884. The Government of India - see their telegram of 24th February, No.F.71/35-Jails - have no objection to this proposal, and recommend that the prisoner should be sent to the Karachi and District Prison. The Foreign Office, in their letter of 3rd December last, suggested that the transfer should be negotiated direct between the Colonial Office and the India Office, and between the appropriate Authorities in Gibraltar and in India. Two subsidiary points have, however, arisaa in connection with Tangier on which it appears necessary to approach the Foreign Office. The first is whether the Tangier Administration will continue after Ramchand 1 s removal to pay the five francs a day, or its equivalent, which they now contribute towards the cost of his maintenance in Gibraltar (please see M. %e Fur’s letter of the 14th July, 1932, at P.Z.5135/32). This five francs represents the maximum the Tangier Administration have felt able to contribute, though it only covers about one-fifth of the cost of maintaining Ramchand at Gibraltar. In India it is probable that the cost of the prisoner’s detention will be cheaper, but at the same time there seems no obvious reason why the present Tangier contribution should be altered. The second point that has arisen is whether the Tangier Administration will accept financial responsibility for the actual transport of the prisoner from Gibraltar to India. It appears that in 1931 the Tangier Administration/Administration did, in fact, accept responsibility for the transference of prisoners from Tangier as far as Gibraltari see Tangier letter of 9th July, 1931, at P.Z.5001/31. Inj the present case^-o£ t&amp;uvau, Tangier’s participation in Wvcry Q. the transfer will be rr-ry remote, and it may^be that they will not be ready again to accept this responsibility. There can, of course, be no question of Gibraltar being called upon to pay for the prisoner’s removal; and the Government of India, who in the long run will probably be ' 1 saving over this transaction, are ready if necessary to meet the cost of transport out of Indian revenues.

Ramchand Tarachand was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Mixed Court at Tangier in 1931 for murder (P.Z.2135/35). As there is no accommodation in Tangier suitable for long-term prisoners, he was ronoved to Gibraltar, a special ordinance being made for the purpose by the Governor of Gibraltar (P.Z.4838/32). India pays about £70 per annum for his maintenance at Gibraltar. 2. It is now reported that his health is suffering from the conditions of his detention at Gibraltar (P.Z.7702/35). H.M. Consul General at Tangier has in consequence suggested his removal to India (P.Z.4863/35), as presumably he would enjoy greater liberty there than is possible in Gibraltar prison; could be more fully employed; and would be surrounded by his fellow countrymen. Also, it seems probable that the cost of his detention in India wDuld be cheaper than the amount at present paid by the Government of India. Mr. Gye*s proposal seems the best course if there are no legal obstacles. 3. We have hitherto acted on the assumption that as Ramchand Tarachand was not condemned by a British Court there are no legal means for his detention during a journey to India (P.Z .7261/31). Both the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office now seem to think that his transference to India could be effected under the Colonial Prisoners Removal Act, 1884 and after making a suggestion that he should be removed to Malta (which the Colonial Office do not favour) the Foreign Office have asked us whether he may be transferred to India. 4/ 2621 6000 3 34Draft Paper. political Department DiiAPT By Air Mail.

I am directed by Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare to refer to foreign Office letter No. W 893,5/1063/28 of the 25th October, and to Colonial Office letter No. 88559/35 of the 13th November regarding the case of the Indian convict, Ramchand Tarachand, who was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment by the Mixed Tribunal at Tangier and who is now serving his sentence in the prison at Gibraltar, to which he was transferred from Tangier. as the Marquess of Zetland is aware, it has transpired that the prison at Gibraltar is unsuitable for the detention of long-term prisoners, and the question has now arisen of the transfer of Ramchand Tarachand to a prison in some other British possession. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare is advised that the removal of the prisoner from Gibraltar can be effected under the Colonial Prisoners Removal Act, 1884, and that consequently there is no legal obstacle to the suggestion made in paragraph 3 of the Colonial Office letter. In this connexion I am to refer to the opinion given by the Law Officers of the Crown on the 26th April, 1926, (copy of which is enclosed for convenience of reference) in which the Law Officers advised that the machinery of this Act might be used to secure the transfer of British subjects who had been sentenced by the Mixed Tribunal in Abyssinia in order to serve long-term sentences in suitable prisons in a British possession. Sir Samuel Hoare entertains the hope that the Marquess of Zetland will agree to the removal/ The Under-Secretary of State India Officeremoval of this Indian prisoner to India, and, if so, he trusts that it will be possible to make arrangements for his transfer as soon as possible, as there is reason to believe that his continued imprisonment at G-ibraltar is having a oad effect on his health. 3.

I HAVE the honour, Indirection of Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, to request the favour of your advice on a point which has arisen in connection with the exercise of His Majesty’s rights of jurisdiction over British subjects in Abyssinia. 2. The extent of that jurisdiction is less well-defined in Abyssinia than it is in other countries, and rests largely upon usage. His Majesty’s Government have, however, always claimed and obtained the benefits of article 7 of the Franco-Abvssinian Treaty of Commerce of the 10th January, 1908, the text of which will be found in the memorandum enclosed as Paper A. It will be seen that the system of jurisdiction provided by that treaty for criminal cases between French citizens and Abyssinian subjects provides for such cases being heard by an Abyssinian magistrate assisted by a French consul. This system differs, as regards cases where a European is defendant or accused, from that which exists in other countries where the system of extra territoriality prevails, since in those countries the rule is that the competent Court is that of the accused’s nationality. The Tribunal established under the Franco- Abyssinian Treaty is known as the “ Mixed Court ” ; its constitution and procedure are somewhat indeterminate, but it may be assumed for present purposes that it is not an ordinary Abyssinian Tribunal but a Court possessing an international character set up by treaty, and the principle is well established, as will be seen from the memorandum enclosed as Paper A, that criminal cases between British and Abyssinian subjects are tried by that Court and not by the ordinary Abyssinian Tribunals. d. His Majesty’s jurisdiction over British subjects in Abyssinia is exercised in accordance with the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913, (Paper B) Article 35 of that Order makes provision for the detention in custody of a British subject, either pending his trial or while he is serving his sentence, in cases dealt with by the Mixed Court (the “ Abyssinian Tribunal ” referred to in the article). This is effected either by a separate warrant by the Consular Court or by the Court’s endorsement on the warrant of the Mixed Court. Under that article, however, such detention can only take place in Abyssinia. 4. Recent cases have shown the necessity'of making provision under which British subjects sentenced by the Mixed Court can be sent to serve their sentence in British territory, since there is no British prison in Abyssinia which is suitable for the reception of long-term prisoners, while the conditions of imprisonment in Abyssinian gaols are such that it is not possible to consent to British subjects convicted before the Mixed Court serving their sentences therein. In the case of British subjects convicted before the Consular Court, provision is made by article 56 of the Order (under section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890) for imprisonment at Aden, Bombay or Malta. In view of the fact, however, that section 7 of the Act is confined to the case of offenders “ convicted before a British Court in a foreign country,” it is not possible to make provision under that section for persons convicted before the Mixed Court, and the question arises whether, without an amendment to the Act, it is possible to amend the Abyssinia Order in Council in such a way as to provide the required facilities. 5. There seems to be no difficulty as regards legalising the detention of the persons in question in prison after their arrival at the British possession to which they are to be sent; this can be effected by local legislation, of which the India Office and Colonial Office respectively are prepared to obtain the enactment. The difficulty arises as regards the detention of the persons ' oncerned in custody in Abyssinia before their removal from that country and on their way from Abyssinia to the place of imprisonment. It has been proposed to effect this by making use of the provisions of section 8 of the Act, and an article, of which a copy is enclosed (Paper C), amending 2856—13 [14492] Jurisdicticn over liriti&amp;ti subjects in Abyssinia.2 ABYSSINIA. article 35 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, has been prepared for this purpose. Section 8 of the Act is the one on which aie based the provisions in foreign Jurisdiction Orders in Council providing for deportation (see, e.j/., article 73 of the Abyssinia Order), and, in view of the fact that the word “removal” is used as well as “deportation” in the section in question, it is suggested that the section provides sufficient authority for the proposed amendment of article 35. It cannot, however, be denied that the effect of the proposed amendment would be to use section S to give power to do that which cannot be done under section 7, and doubts have accordingly been expressed as to whether, in the event of the lawfulness of the detention in custody of a convicted prisoner on his way from Abyssinia to Aden or Berbera being questioned before a competent Court, the provision in question would be upheld. 6. It has been suggested that an alternative method would be to deal with the cases in question under the Colonial Prisoners Removal Act, 1884, which w r as applied by article 79 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913, to Abyssinia as if Ab 3 r ssinia were a British possession, with the substitution of the Consul-General for the Governor of a British possession. No such express limitation as that contained in section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act (the words “convicted before a British Court in a foreign country ”) is involved, and it is suggested that it could be argued that, even if the Mixed Court is technically an Abyssinian Tribunal, it is nevertheless exercising His Majesty’s jurisdiction in the case contemplated ; that it w'ould, therefore, not be improper that persons convicted by it should be removed under the Act, and that there is nothing in the Act or in its application by article 79 to Abyssinia to prevent this being done. 7. If neither of these two courses can be adopted, it would appear that no power exists to make the necessary provision except by obtaining an amendment of section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act so as to make it applicable to British subjects convicted before tribunals of the nature of the Mixed Court, a proceeding to which it is presumed there would be no legal objection. 8. 1 am also to transmit for your consideration the draft of an article (Paper D) to replace article 56 of the Abyssinia Order in Council, 1913, under which offenders convicted before the Consular Court can be sent for imprisonment to Aden, Bombay or Malta. The object of the new article is merely to add Berbera to the places in question, but, inasmuch as Berbera is in a protectorate and is not therefore “a place within His Majesty’s dominions,” it has been necessary to reword the existing article 56. 9. In these circumstances, I am to request you to take the enclosed papers into your consideration and to favour Sir Austen Chamberlain with your opinion on the following points :— (1.) Whether the terms of the proposed article to replace article 56 of the Abyssinia Order in Council (Paper D) are fit and proper to be submitted for His Majesty’s approval ? (2.) Whether the proposed amendment of article 35 of the Abyssinia Order in Council (Paper C) affords a satisfactory method of dealing with the situation described in paragraphs 2-4 above, and can properly be submitted for His Majesty’s approval ? (3.) In the event of your answ T er to question (2) being in the negative, whether the alternative method suggested in paragraph 6 above can properly be adopted ? In the event of your being unable to advise the acceptance of either of the two suggested courses, Sir Austen Chamberlain would be grateful for any alternative suggestions which you may be able to offer as to the means to be adopted for dealing with the question.

Section 7 is designed to deal with the case of convicted offenders; section 8 is directed to the case of persons who have not been convicted and sentenced, but whose removal or deportation has been ordered under powers such as those afforded by paragraph 73 of the Abyssinia Order in Council. We do not, therefore, consider that section 8 is apt to deal with the difficulty arising in the case of convicted offenders. We think, however, that a provision might be made by the alternative methods suggested in the Foreign Office letter, namely, by dealing with cases under section 2 of the Prisoners Removal Act, 1884. That Act has been applied to Abyssinia by paragraph 79 of the Abyssinia Order in Council; and the case seems to us to fall within section 2 (d) of the Act. We have nothing to add.

Where the removal of a prisoner from a British posses sion is ordered in pursuance of this Act, a Secretary of State or the Governor of the British possession may by warrant under his hand direct the prisoner to be removed to the part of Her Majesty’s dominions mentioned in the said order, and for that purpose to be delivered into the custody of the persons named or described in the 3 A.D.1884.

Mr. Mac &gt;onald is not aw? re whether there is accomodation available in Malta which would be suitable fox» the detention of this convict* and it would be necessary to consult the Governor of Malta on this point. In the first instance* however, I an to request you to inform Secx'etary air 3amuel Ho&amp;re that Mr. MacDonald is advised that* thou^i the Government of Malta could properly legislate for the detention in Malta of British subjects sentenced to imprisonment by the Mixed Court at Tangier, neither ggraSTAMI OF dTATS* Kim OFFICE. thatthat Government nor the Government of Gibraltar has po*~'' to legislate for the tra afer of such a prisoner f!ron Gibraltar to Malta or for his a&amp;fe custody whilst on the high seas en route to Malta* in this connec tion l a© to invite reference to the corrcsT&gt;on&lt;ience ending with Colonial Office letter (Ho* 31539/34} of the 3rd of ’.oveaber, 1934 9 in regard to the return to 'Tangier of British subjects sentenced to Inprisfwisnt by the Mixed Court at Tangier who have been detained in prison in Gibraltar* if the prisoner were transferred from Gibraltar to Malta it is, of course, unlikely that he would start m’oeee ings for his release whilst on the high, seas, though he might possibly claim damages for false imprisonment. 3. It has been suggested to Mr. MaeOonald that, although Taraehand was sentenced in Tangier, he is now ' undergoing sentence of imprisonment* in Gibraltar having regard to the wording of Gibraltar Ordinance No* 9 of 1938 (a copy of which was enclosed in Colonial Office letter No. 91262/34 0 f the 9th of ogust, 1934), and that it might therefore be possible toto effect his removal from Gibraltar to some other British possession by using the machinery provided by the Colonial Prisoners removal Aet f 18 It is true that the words t? sentence of imprisonment passed in a British possession^ 1 in .ecti&lt;m 4(2} of the /ct # and the words ^his conviction, judgment and sentence ®*sy be questioned in the part of Her Majesty's - dominions from which he has been removed in the same manner as if he had not been restored 51 in Section 8(1) of trie Act, suggest that the machinery provided by the ct was intended to be applicable only to the removal of a prisoner £r&lt;m the place where he is sentenced, or from some other place to *&amp;ieh he has been removed under the Act# but it is open to question whether that suggestim is sufficiently strong to render the Act inapplicable to a casc such as th&amp;t now under c- t iaideration* If f&amp;r&amp;chnnd wore removed under the Colonial Prisoners Removal Act from Gibraltar to sone other British possession legislation to provide for his detention in that other possession would not be necessary, since the Colonial Pi*isoners Removal Act wouldwould provide the necessary statutory authority tor his trunk. &amp;r and detention; and in that ease it is suggested th&amp;t the f-opropri&amp;te course would be for arrangements to be made for his removal to India* 4* Both courses present legal difficulties and I am to inquire which of the two air Samuel Hofa*e would prefer to see adopted* 5* Copies of this letter and of the letter under reply are being forwarded to the India Office* I a&amp;t *.ir.

It is understood that a copy of that despatch has been sent to you direct by the Consul General. efore considering the possibility of giving effect to the proposed transfer of the prisoner from Gibraltar, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has enquired whether the prison conditions and the health of Ramchand Tarachand are in fact such as to necessitate the latter* s removal to another territory. I should be obliged if you would furnish me with your views on these points. I have, etc., (SOD.) Malcolm MacDonald GOVERNORNo. 148 GIBRALTAR. 28th September, 1956. Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 162 of the 2nd September, regarding the proposed transfer of the convict Ramchand Tarachand to India, I have the honour to transmit, for your consideration, a copy of a certificate from the Prison Surgeon regarding the state of health of this prisoner. 2. Other Medical Officers, who have acted as Prison Surgeon, have also held the view that, owing to the monotony of the work and the narrow limits within which they are confined, long sentence prisoners in Gibraltar tend, after a time, to become mentally affected to some extent. It is not possible in this small prison to provide the periodical changes in occupation and environment which are customary in the United Kingdom and in the larger prisons in the Crown Colonies. The introduction of outside working parties has been considered from time to time but this would necessitate the appointment of additional warders and a consequent increase in expenditure. As it is only on very rare occasions that long sentence prisoners are confined in the Gibraltar Prison, it was not considered that any such Increase in expenditure was justified. 3./ The Right Honourable Malcolm John MacDonald, M.P.,3. Ramchand Tarachand has new been confined in the Civil Prison for just over 3 years and the Superintendent of the Prison strongly recommends that he should, if possible, be transferred to an establishment which is better suited for the confine ment of long sentence prisoners. I concur in this recommendation and I would suggest that the possibility of giving effect to it should be fully explored. I have, etc., (Sd) C. H. HARINGTON General and GovernorMEMORANDUM FROM PRISON SURGEON TO ACTING COLONIAL SURGEON. Prisoner Ramehand Tarachand has been in indifferent health for some time. He suffers from chronic bronchitis and at times from gastric trouble, and mental depression. I consider that his health would probably improve if he were removed to another country. I am of opinion that the conditions obtaining at the Gibraltar Prison are such that in time the long-term prisoners become adversely affected. (Sd) L.

On the principle that India should bear the expenses of securing more certain justice for British Indian subjects (i.e. through consular courts) the Government of India are probably liable in this instance. In the case of Ramchand Tarachand, the cost of maintenance was accepted by this Office without reference to India.

I enclose herewith copies of reports made to the Government of Gibraltar by the Chief of Police and by the Prison durgeon.

In these circumstances, 1 have the honour to enquire whether it would be possible to re-examine the suggestion made tentatively by Mr* Gurney in Para. 9 of his despatch ^:o. ^7 of karch 11th, 1931 . The transfer of the prisoner from Gibraltar to India would seem to offer certain advantages. In the first place, fiAMCHAKX) Tsrachand would presumably enjoy greater liberty than is possible in Gibraltar Prison. Purtbermore, he could be more fully employed and would be surrounded by bis fellow-countrymen. In addition, it seems probable that the cost of his detention in inaia would be cheaper then the amount at present paid by the Government/ ills Majesty*s Principal monetary of State for foreign Affairs, YOttOGI?

I have already obtained an informal expression of tiie views 01 the Tangier Acminiatration on such a transfer and they have expressed themselves in agreement with the suggestion provided the prisoner is not released before the expiry of his sentence. They also stipulated that the Tangier zone should not be held responsible for the convict’s transport to India and that the cost of his maintenance should at all events not be increased, while they hoped for a reduction. 5 * I am sending copy of this despatch tia Ilie excellency the Governor of Gibraltar.

I am* Your obedient Servant 'Sd.) MAURICE PETERSON.Mr. Dalton. Mr. Pratap Dialdas, a merchant of Hyderabad, Sind, who has recently been in Gibralter, came to see me this morning in order to discuss the case of Hamchand Tarachand, the Indian who is in prison in Gibralter on a life sentence for a particularly brutal murder committed in Tangier in 1930. He asked whether anything could be done to secure this man's release, but the only argument he adduced for such action is the fact that the man's wife and children are indigent in Sind. (I am quite confident that there is nothing in this argument^because Hamchand Terachand has two brothers who describe themselves as Indian merchants of Hyderabad, Sind,trading in Sekondi in the Gold Coast Colony Ct\,'V-cu.t. o.vwouuA' and a good deal of money is obviously being spent in lawyers fees for the drafting of petitions on behalf of Kamchand Tarachand). I told Mr. Dialdas that in view of the nature of the crime, and the fact that Hamchand Tarachand hed a perfectly fair trial, this Office would not intervene on his behalf. I said, however, in answer to Mr. Dialdas’s question, that if the Tangier Administration suggested the man's release a new situation would arise. Mr. Dialdas seemed quite happy with this. S ll'U.Qt-VOvA The legal dooi-ei-cra regarding the release of this man is contained in Foreign Office letter of 14th May, P.Z.3438/35. Mr. Dialdas told me that the Spanish taxi- driver^ wno assisted Tarachand in the murder and who was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment^was released by the Spanish authorities after one year in prison at Tetuan. I don't think that this is really relevant to the questionof the release of Tarachand who was clearly the principal criminal, but we might pass on the information to the Foreign Office in the draft as attached. \'« i eu.V'oA'xV^ A member of a firm of Liverpool Solicitors left a petition by damchand Tarachand's two brothers at this Office only this month.

He has always been good and in his letters, I can read and see he is thoroughly repented. We have all suffered enormously. We are in a most deplorable condition now. We are totally ruined. The poor I innocent children are suffering too much. How they cry and yearn for a fatherly pat. And for him it is also a great suffering to be father and not to know his children. Lastly for their sake and mine I beg of your Honour to intercede with the higher authorities so that the peace and quietness which we so much require, may be restored to our home specially on such an occasion as this Silver Jubilee.

It will be recollected that it was agreed that this Government should be paid the sum of 5/» per diem in respect of the cost of maintenance of this convict. Xhe International Administration of the xangier Zone have agreed to contribute 5 francs per diem towards this charge, the balance being met by the Government of India. As, owing to fluctuations in exchange, the value of the Xangier contribution in sterling will be variable, it is pro osed to collect this amount quarterly from the mangier Administration and to submit a claim to the India Office, through the Crown Agents for the Colonies, for the balance due from the Government of India. Such claims would be supported b$ a certificate to the effect that the convict is still alive. 3. I would request that this proposed procedure may be brought to the notice of the India Office with a view to ascertaining whether it is acceptable to that Department, or whether that Department has any other procedure to suggest.

ANNUAL REPORT 1931. ******* 208. The only case of interest to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom dealt with hy the court was the trial of an Indian named Ramchand Tarachand, who committed a hrutal murder in November 1930, his victim being a fellow Indian, Metheram Menghraj Mahtani. The motive of the crime was robbery, and a Spanish taxi-driver, Joaquin Guerrero Ledesma, who drove Tarachand and his victim to the place where the crime was committed and remained there while the murder took place, was cited as accessory before and after the fact. 209. The trial of both men took place simultaneously on the 2nd March before the British magistrate of the Mixed Court and a mixed jury of British subjects and Spaniards. Ranchand and his accomplice were both pronounced guilty and Ramchand was sentenced to imprisonment for life, while Ledesma was sentenced to fifteen years* Imprisonment. The death penalty was not pronounced in the case of Tarachand, only because the Spanish members of the jury which, according to the Tangier code of criminal procedure, must concur in the sentence, as well as one of the British members of local origin, refused to vote for the application of the death penalty. 210. As soon as Ramchand Tarachand had been handed over by the Mixed Court to the judicial authorities of the zone to undergo his sentence, the Administrator wrote to me requesting me to arrange for him to be transferred to some British penitentiary establishment as the prison service of the zone was not capable of undertaking the detention of prisoners condemned to long terms of imprisonment, nor was the accommodation suitable, while it would be impossible, in view of the small number of foreign prisoners likely to be confined in Tangier, to arrange for them to be suitably employed. I communicated a copy of M. le Pur's letter to the Foreign Office, and asked to be informed whether Tarachand could be transferred to Gibraltar or India to undergo his sentence. After correspondence between the Foreign Office, the Home Office, the India Office and the Colonial Office, it was decided that Tarachand might be transferred to Gibraltar to undergo his sentence, but that it would be necessary for the Governor of Gibraltar to issue an ordinance to make such detention lawful. It was also stipulated that the Administration of the Tangier Zone must pay the cost of his maintenance at Gibraltar. On my enquiring as to the amount which would be charged to the Administration, the sum of 8s. a day was first mentioned. This was later reduced to 5s. The latter sum still seemed too high for the Administration of Tangier to contract to pay, and a proposal was put forward in November by the Foreign Office that an endeavour should be made to arrange for the keep of prisoners transferred from Tangier to Gibraltar on a basis of the zone paying 5 fr. a day, as they do in similar cases to the authorities of the French Zone, the country of origin of the prisoner being called upon to find the balance. 211 /211- In June the Spanish procureur of the Mixed Court, Senor Arizcun, was transferred from Tangier to &amp; post in Spain and was succeeded hy Senor Franqueira- As previously reported, Senor Arizcun was notoriously lax in ^ the execution of his duties besides displaying partiality towards his countrymen - it is, indeed, reported that on his departure a drawer in his room at the court was found to he full of complaints against Spaniards which he had refused to proceed with in the court. His departure was therefore hailed with relief hy the majority of people in Tangier, and it is to he hoped that his successor will prove to he less biassed in favour of his own countrymen and more ready to fulfil the duties of his office. It is as yet rather too early, however, to form an opinion as to the conduct of Senor Franqueira.In any further communication on this subject, please quote and address —not 1o any pers&lt;/n by name, but to— “ 1'he Under-Secretarv of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. • &gt; 7 ■ t m % 9. % . 4016 i '■ JO.52._l THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to and. hv direetion of rho Soprpfnrv of State. and, by direction of t!he Secretary of State, transmits herewith copi-^S of the under-mentioned paper.

I 1738 (fJo. j r ofpl932) GIBRALTAR No. of 1 9 3 2. ( ,1932.) An ORDINANCE to amend 'The Civil prison Ordinance 1889 .• Be it enacted by Hia Excellency the Governor of the City and Garrison of Gibraltar as follows: Short title. 1. This Ordinance may be cited as the Civil Prison Amendment Ordinance, 1932, and shall be Ord. 8 of 1889. read and construed as one with “The Civil Prison Ordinance, 1889', hereinafter called the Principal Ordinance, and any amendment thereof. Arndt, of Ord. 2. The Principal Ordinance is hereby amended by 8 of 1889. adding the following Sections after Section 23:- '23A. Where an offender, being a British •subject, is sentenced to imprisonment before 'the Mixed Court at Tangier and is brought to 'Gibraltar in custody such offender may be •taken into custody and may be imprisoned in British subject sentenced by Mixed Court at Tangier may be imprisoned in Gibraltar. •the prison and shall be deemed to be in •lawful detention in Gibraltar for the tern or unexpired term of his sentence as though 'that sentence had been imposed by the •Supreme court.' '23B.Person so detained subject to prison i gulations. Governor’s approval necessary. Chai&amp;e for maintenance. Caamencement. '23B. Any person received into custody in 'Gibraltar or detained in the prison under the 'authority of the provisions of 'action 23 A. 'shall be subject to the prison regulations in 'all respects as if he were an offender 'sentenced by the Supreme Court, and the 'warrant, order or other document for the 'detention, custody or imprisonment of such 'person issued by the Mixed Court at Tangier 'shall for all purposes in connection with “the custody of such prisoner in Gibraltar or 'the detention of such prisoner in the prison, 'have the same force and effect as though it 'had been a warrant, order or other document 'for such purpose issued by the Supreme Court.' '23C. No person shall be detained in 'Gibraltar under the provisions of Section 23A. 'without the approval in writing of the Govemo r# '23 d. There shall be paid for the 'detention in Gibraltar of any person detained ■under the provisions of Section 23A. such sum, 'if any, as may be agreed upon between the •Governor and the proper authorities of the 'Administration of the Tangier Zone.' 3. This Ordinance shall cane into operation ] (Intld) H.C.F.C. (Intld.) A.G. 15. 2. 32.5. It will probably seem at first as though this legislation should be by way of a separate Ordinance but there are many advantages in not doing so and in making it an amending Ordinance. The chief of which *re that it indicates exactly what is wanted namely, that the person in question should be treated just the same as an ordinary prisoner while he is in Gibraltar and also in drafting one is able to use the terras ’’the prison' and 'prison regulations* both of which are exhaustively defined in 'The Civil Prison Ordinance, 1339.' 6. The four new sections have been Inserted in the Ordinance after Section 23 as that would appear to be the most appropriate place to do so and avoid the use of a 'Notwithstanding* section, 7. Clause 23A. provides that British subjects sentenced by the fixed Court at Tangier if brought to Gibraltar in custody may be imprisoned in Gibraltar and shall be deemed to be in lawful detention in Gibraltar for the period of their sentences as though the same has been imposed by the Supreme Court. The first words of the Clause are taken from Section 7 of the foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890 (53 and 54 Viet, c.37) and the body of the Clause incorporates the main provisions embodied in paragraph 3 of letter $5432/1931 of 8th June, 1931 from the Colonial Office to the Foreign Office, a copy of which was enclosed in Secretary of State’s Miscellaneous despatch of 29th September, 1931. 8 .(&amp;) 8. Clause 23B. provides that any person detained under the preceding section shall be subject to the prison regulations (which terra is defined in Section 2 of the Principal Ordinance) and that the documents authorising the detention shall have full force and effect in Gibraltar as if issued by the Supreme Court. The use of the word 'custody* is intended to overcome any difficulty there may be in removing the prisoner from the ship to a prison. 9. Clause 23C. which requires the Governor’s approval in writing for a prisoner to be detained under Clause 23A. is intended to be used in conjunction with Clause 23D. which provides for the charge for maintenance of such prisoners; these two clauses taken together will assist in preventing the possibility of Gibraltar having prisoners foisted upon her unexpectedly or at an inconvenient time.

S.W.l. 16th January, 1932. lol I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to refer to your letter P.Z. 7261/31 of the 12th January in which it is stated that the Secretary of State for India agrees that the balance between the amount which the Tangier Administration are prepared to pay and the actual cost of the maintenance of British prisoners in Gibraltar should be borne by the country of origin of the prisoner. 2. Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare will have observed from the Colonial Office letter No. 81432/31 of the 6 th January to this department that the Governor of Gibraltar is unable to reduce the charge for the maintenance of prisoners below the figure of five shillings a day and that he is unwilling that prisoners shall be transferred from Tangier to Gibraltar until their country of origin has actually agreed to meet the balance of the maintenance expenses. 3 . In these circumstances I am to request that the Secretary of State may be informed whether the Government of India are now prepared to agree to defray the balance of the cost of maintaining Ramchand in prison at Gibraltar in order that arrangements may be made with the AdministratLcn of Tangier for his removal from the Zone with the least possible delay. 4.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Miscellaneous despatch of the 16th November, on the subject of the detention in the Gibraltar Civil Prison of British subjects sentenced to imprisonment by the Mixed Court at Tangier. 2. The figures given in paragraph 2 of Brigadier Crichton’s despatch No. 143 of the 12th September, 1931, were as indicated, arrived at after taking into consideration all overhead charges. I have, however, caused the matter to be further reviewed and am satisfied that certain of these expenses could be reasonably omitted, whilst due account has now been taken of certain remunerative labour performed by prisoners. Having regard to these factors, therefore, ^ tM ) j would be prepared to ask the Tangier administration to pay the sum of 5/- a day instead of that previously proposed. I regret that I would not feel justified in reducing the charge to the equivalent of the five francs made by the Authorities of the French Zone; the standard of living and general conditions which prevail there no doubt admit of this low cost. 3.

Frs. 5 With reference to your letter No. 81432/31 of the 28th September last regarding the detention in Gibraltar of British subjects sentenced to imprisonment by the Mixed Court of Tangier, I am directed by the Marquess of Reading to inform you that His Majesty’s Consul-General was instructed to notify the Administration that the Government of Gibraltar would require them to pay the sum of nine shillings a day for the maintenance of each prisoner transferred to Gibraltar. 2. Mr. Gurney now reports that the Administration are much concerned at this demand. They have called his attention to the fact that for prisoners detained in the French Zone of Morocco they are only required to pay the sum of five francs a day, and that those transferred to the Spanish Zone are maintained free of cost. They have pointed (&gt;2.C®^yout that if called upon to maintain even one British 9s.-. prisoner at the rate of nine shillings a day, they will be obliged to make a special provision in the Budget. As there already exists a deficit in the Budget and as it is impossible for the Administration to meet the expenses of the coming year without assistance from outside, the Secretary of State feels that it would be impossible to call upon them to pay for the maintenance of British prisoners at a rate nine times higher than the rate paid for the maintenance of French prisoners. 3. The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office.3. I am accordingly to request that if Mr. Secretary Thomas sees no objection, the situation may he fully explained to the G-overnor of Gibraltar; that the latter may be reminded that the present case is the onl„ case in which a British subject has been sentenced to along term of imprisonment during the six years the Tangier Statuce has been in force, and that he should be asked \;iiechei he will agree to reduce v/hat appears to Lord Heading to oe the excessive charge of nine shillings a day to one equivalent or approximating' to the charge of five irancs made by the authorities of the french Zone.

The Tangier Mixed Court not being a British Court in a foreign country. Section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act of 1890 does not apply to the case; and Mr. Henderson’s advisers have at present been unable to discover any means by v/hich the serving in British territory of sentences of imprisonment inflicted on British subjects by the Mixed Court at Tangier can be provided for otherwise than by legislation. His Majesty’s Consul General states there is no suitable prison in Tangier and Mr. Henderson cannot contemplate with equanimity the detention of British subjects for a long period in a Moorish prison in Tangier. Moreover arrangements for the transfer of persons of Spanish and French nationality undergoing sentences has been arranged for by their respective governments. The positionlearn whether Mr. Wedgwood Benn has any alternative suggestions as to means by which the difficulty could he surmounted or alternatively if he would concur in the submission to Parliament of a Bill making provision for the carrying into effect in British territory of sentences of imprisonment inflicted on British subjects in Tangier. The number of British subjects sentenced to imprisonment in Tangier is likely to be very small. The present case is the first which has arisen during a period of some five years during which the Mixed Courts have been in operation. 4. If legislation is the only means by which the object can be achieved, Mr. Henderson suggests that the amendment of section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act making the provisions of that section apply to convictions by the Mixed Court at Tangier would be the most suitable form. An Order in Council might then be made on the lines of Article 32 of the Morocco Orders in Council 1889-1929 consolidated. A copy of the consolidated Orders in Council is enclosed but I am to point out that owing to a misprint the reference to Section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 1890 in Article 32 appears as Section 6. 5. A similar letter is being addressed to the Colonial Office and the Home Office. I am Sir Your obedient Servant■■■■■ C- I i&gt;ir 5 2135 . i 9 5 1 j X A M G I K R, j-aroh 11 , 1951 . I hove the honour to report that on the night of Hoveraber 13 last a Jiritloh Indian subject, Kanchand ' ' ToraciiRnd, reoidcnt in Tangier, xiiurdered, vdth the aefiie- t«noe of e. ^ponlah taxi-driver* Joaquin Guerrero x^ede&amp;mo a fellow In*Han, 'by neue iletherM Menglirej Uehtani. The preliminary police investigation and the subsequent extuU,- nr.tion by the Public Prooeoutor, Monsieur 1 :odlere, left little doubt fsQ to the culpability of hoiaohand Tarachand and Guerrero, and the two men were conmitted for trial at the nert crlniinal essigi which wao due to be held in Mareik* 2 . The case was tried on liaroh 2 , the presiding ^udge being the British member on the iiiixed Court, Judge Borne. The Court had sppolrted Mnltre deurln, one of the ablest lawyers in Tangier, to defonci keachend Tarachand while Guerrero was defended by Maltre Castro. The accused wert\ tried together before a j'^ry consisting of three British subjects and three Spanish subjects, and were pronounced siachand araohand being condemned to imprl soniaent .tor life and Guerrero receiving a sentence of 15 years imprison;lent. The trial lasted for two day© and the case for the prosecution wap thoroughly proved despite e compl danlal by both the accused of any ooaplleity In the crime : a defence which *na feclUtated by the feet that the police when the orime was first discovered, allowed the removal ’ and cremation of the corpse of the victim before the Public Prosecutor had time to examine the body on the site of the crime. This foot undoubtedly resulted in the destruction of some of the evidence against the accused and the police / have His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of dtate for Foreign Affairs..eve been'attooled In the loori i rees for their careXeasncaa* 3* The c ime was of a particularly brutal nature, the principal author, Raaohend iereohond, having returned soae time after the first attack on Mahtanl in oiKler to batter in the head of his victim. The motive appears to have been robbery, as money, known to have been in the possession of the victim, was discovered on the person of kamchand Terechan The crime was further accoza janied by the ac grave ting circum stances of treachery, gnat-apene' and premeditation, and should therefore have been punished by the death penalty. 4* The death penalty cannot however be pronounced in Tangier without the concurrence of the 3 ury. Although the deliberations of the latter are not suxjposed to be divulged 'l understand that two members of the jury of British origin wished to apply 'the defth penalty, but that the remaining British member, of local origin voted, with the Spanish members, against the oeath sentence on the principle, not that the aeeth sentence had not been merited, but that he oould not reconcile it with hie conscience to condemn a man to death. 5* The dponieh members of the jury once more showed their partiality in favour of their compatriot and a certain reluctance to convict. 6 . tbm Auialnlatretor of the lankier Zone has now approached me with a request that, os the done possesses no organised penitentiary service suitable for the detention of a prisoner during a life sentence, arrangements should be made for the transfer of Kamchand Torachand to a x&gt;enal eataPlieh ient under British Jurisdiction. 1 enclose herein copy of the communication in which inonsieur le Fur makes this request. / 7*sums of i'ranoe 5 end r-eeetee 2 a day are payable by the administration In the case of prisoners confined in the iranoh find, upanieh Tories rospcolively. 10. 00 far as 1 can see the only alternative would be to ask the French or Spanish Government to take charge of the inoivlduel, who sight I euppoee be aanfined in a prison in either the French or the Spanish Zone.
