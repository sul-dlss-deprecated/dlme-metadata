C* Ga lloway, Bushh **Abdul Latif She ikh Mohomad came to see me this morning. He is a British subject born in India of a Kuwait family. He is owed about Rs, 15,000 by Ahmad bin Khalaf of Abu Dhabi. This is a pearl debt and dates from 1926. He has tried to obt a in even a part of this sum but has not been successful. He filed a suit in the court here as part of the transaction took place here but the summonses were returned from Bushire with a remark to the effect that service could not be effected on the Trucial Coast. I remember writing to Abdur Razzak when I was in Bahrain about the case but do not remember what the result was. I have explained to the old gentleman that he was silly to have advanced the money and he agreed but said he had dealt with Ahmad bin Khaxaf for many years. He is willing to compromise for a reasonable amount as things are very bad in the pearl market. I told him I would write and ask if an official pressure could be brought to bear to make Ahmad pay something possibly through the Residency Agent. I know we have done it i or other people.

I enclose a letter in original, with a copy of its translation, which I have received from Muhammad bin \bdul Latif al Abdur Bazzaq of Kuwait, a British subject, in connection with his claim against Ahmad bin Khalaf bin ’Utaibah of Abu Dhabi, for such action as you deem fit to take. Muhammad’s father to whom he refers is permanently resident in Bombay. Political Agent, Kuwait.n Translation of letter dated 5th January 1939 from Mohammad •bin Vbdul Latif al \taur Bazzaq, to the Political ^gent, Kuwait* A. • C • ) I heg to Inform you that Khalaf bin Abdullah and Ahmad bin Khalaf bin # Utaibah are indebted to us for a sum of Ks. 15476/- which they had taken from us as a loan. Some goods (pearls) belonging to him ( Ahmad bin Khalaf) were in our possession but he requested us to return them to him so that he may arrange them and add some more to them and then hand them over to us so that they may find market, relied on his word and sent the goods to him by steamer through Shaikh Muhammad bin Dalrauk. Later, however, he started giving us false promises that he would send the goods baok and making requests to us every now and then. Then we discovered that he was deceiving us we asked some of our merchant friends at Dubai to draw his attention to the bad result of cheating and playing tricks and to do favour in return for favours done to him. In his presence those friends mediated and arranged that the debt should be paid by instalments. He agreed to this and promised tc remit the first instalment to them at Bombay but he lied and began cicumventing and keeping away from them. later my father wrote a letter to the Hon f bJe the Political Resident from Bombay and we received a reply from the Political Agent, Bahrain, demanding the presence of my father with all the documentary proof which we have in our possession in support of our claim against Khalaf bin Abdullah and Ahmad bin Khalaf bin •Utaibah which they denied and admitted a small part thereof. After the receipt of Political Agent, Bahrain # s letter by my father he sent me all documents, account books and letters exchanged between both parties and instructed me to procesd to Bahrain, i left all my work and proceededto Bahrain and thence to Dubai ^here I met Ahmad bin Khalaf bin •Utaibali and, in the presence of a group of respectable merchants, the amount was proved against him on the strength of the documents which I &amp;ot from him. Those merchnats will testify to this effect. He also admitted the amount but alleged that he had forgotten it. This is a lie on his part as he had already admitted the amount at the time when the gentlemen mediated and agreed to pay the instalments. Now whan he came to Imow that no benefit could be obtained by telling lies, deceiving and circumventing, he pretended that he had sustained loss and that, therefore, he could not afford to pay all the amount. This allegation is untrue as he is presently the richest person on the Coast and gives financial support to all the people of Abu Dhabi. X request His Majesty’s Government to administer Justice in this case and to press him to pay our claim. The interest which would have been obtained on this amount during all this period has been wasted. Vq are expecting very anxiously that our claim will be recovered from those oppressors. Je have a sanguine hope that, when you come to know the fact that he has been intentionally acting in a dishonest way with a view to squandering our rights, you will take steps to administer justice in this case.

The claim relates to a pearl transaction dating from 1926, which was originally brought to the attention of the Political Agent, Bahrain in 1936 by Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman Zayani of Karachi, a friend of the claimant. Included in the file is a Power of Attorney granted by the claimant to his son Yusuf bin Abdul Latif in Bombay in 1945, to enable him to pursue in the Shaikh’s court in Abu Dhabi or Dubai, the debt judgements already made in his father’s favour by the Bombay High Court in 1939. The main correspondents are the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Residency Agent, Sharjah who investigate the settlement of the debt claim between 1936 and 1939, and then again between 1947 and 1949, in response to further petitioning from Mohamed and Khalid bin Abdul Latif, also sons of the claimant and residents of Kuwait. Two letters and a memorandum by the Residency Agent about an attempted mediated settlement by a committee of merchants at Dubai in 1947, a letter from the Political Agent to Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman Zayani of Karachi, and two letters from the claimant’s son Mohamed Abdul-Latif Al-Abdul-Razzak, a pearl merchant of Kuwait, are in English and Arabic.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Debt recovery</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Abu Dhabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000261#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
