We have passed to the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations “the contents of your two previous signals on the subject and Iiave explained orally at this stage to the Ministry of Defence the reasons for Abdul Ghafar Khan*s return. 3. We do not feel that we can intervene in the selection of a replacement. If a request is to be put to the Government of Pakistan it seems the candidate selected should be accepted. Should we step in, however tactfully, the inference will be that we do not trust the Pakistan Army to select the right man. In any case we cannot effectively assist in selection in, say, one interview* 4. Shortage of officers in the Pakistan Army results in their leaning heavily on Junior Commissioned Officers at the moment and we feel that Cortmtxnding Officers may be loath to part with a first-class Junior Commissioned Officer with the qualities required. *Ve therefore make the suggestion that the Muscat Infantry may like to consider employing an older man about to retire, or already retired, from regular service. In this case, with the approval of the Government of Pakistan, it is possible that we could assist by approaching certain British officers of the old Indian Army whoare still emploved at RegimentaICentres, etc., in Pakistan. 5. We do not intend to take any further action until your reply is received. Should the Muscat Infantry wish us'to work on the possibility of obtaining a retired Viceroy’s Commissioned Officer or Junior Commissioned Officer we will require full details of conditions of service such as rates of P a y* gratuities, allowances, accommodation and leave and passages. We shall also require a brief statement of the duties expected of the candidate, to include qualifications such as languages he must be able to speak.

Dear ,ir Hupert, } *y I refer to paragraph 39 of your monthly summary for October ? I am not sure whether you are aware that the strength of the !-usoat Infantry has been drastically reduced from the original number of 300, fluid now totals 175 Baluchis and Arabs with 6 Pakistanis and the British Conaneuidant. I believe they were slightly over strength in N.C,0* s as a result of the reduction. As regerds the Police Force, T am not sure from your paragraph whether you know that there is in fact a police force in existence, which is not sufficient to take over guard duties, but deals with traffic, port control and immigration, based on rirani Fort, and totalling 60, under the command of an Inspector who served previously with the Infantry. He is a local Baluchi (as are nearly all the police) and is apparently competent. Yours sincerely d.

Dear Hig^i Commission, Our telegram No. 2 of 17th November, The Muscat Government are returning Subedar Abdul Ghaf&amp;r Khan for reasons contained in the enclosed copy of a letter dated 12th November. t7e should be grateful if you would inform the Pakistan authorities accordingly, and also that the I^iscat Government would like a replacement for him. 2. As you see from their letter, the I'usoat Govern* ment would greatly appreciate your assistance in choosing such a replacement, if it is possible. The fact is that the type of man wanted is the old type of Subedar Major that the Indian Army used to have, who was his Colonel’s right hand man, with complete loyalty to his colonel, and the colonel's mouthpiece with the native troops. The efficient go-ahead type of officer, anxious to shine on his own which the Pakistan Army is doubtless trying to produce, and anxious to sent abroad as a shining example of Made in Pakistan is exactly what is not wanted here, where the conditions are somewhat behind modern times — and where the local force is not large: indeed as you see, it is little more than half what it was when The United Kingdom High Commission, KARACHI,oubed&amp;r i Mill Ghafar han was sent here, 3* Unfortunately, this is a little difficult to put over to the Pakistan Gcreraaent - especially by letter• It is for this reason that weaetro very rw^i to have your help if possible* As you afe aware the Goamandant of the Levies is an Knglish Officer, and it is desirable that th^y make a good shoving* 4* ould you also please convey to the Pakistan authorities the contents of the last paragraph of the Muscat Government*s letter* Tours ever.

Clerk Iviohd Yunis. Bugler Said Rahman is at present being paid Rs. 15/- permensem and appears to be perfectly content with the amount. Tie duties and responsibilities of the Jemadar and clerk are far greater than those of the Bugler and to give him a remuneration almost equivalent to theirs may lead to discontent. The Commandant feels that he should not be given more than Rs. 25/- per mensem. 3* The Bugler, of course, gets dollar compensation in addition to his special remuneration. fuse at Government assure the Pakistan Government that their decision in this matter will be regarded as final.

Lieutenant Abdul Qadir, the Subedar Major has now gone 2 He told me he had resigned, but there was pressure from the Sultan, who has decided to make a very clean sweep of all the officers. I understand Boulter, late Rejputana Rifles, has accepted the post of Commandant, and will relieve Campbell, in the middle of next month. He is coming by air so you may see him in Bahrain. 3. Campbell still does not know, but is to be asked to go before Boulter comes, handing over to the new Subedar whom they hope to get from Pakistan in time and to make S'&amp;edar fa Jar* A Jemadar came some weeks ago to replace the former 4* artillery Subedar, and now they are trying to get a regular orderly room clerk on deputation as well. Then I believe they will revert to further recruitment 5 of Baluchis as well as local Arabs, and hope the new salary and a less pro—Arab Commandant will prevent any further discontent. Actually I do not believe Campbell was in the least anti-Baluch, and was in fact learning their language. All the trouble took place when he was on leave, and^as I said at the time, the very sutfden bust up was, I am certain the result of the unit being left idle for too long a period. Tours sincerely.

M f s Ambassador at Tehran to find employment, if possible, for Shaikh Luhammad Sa f id, one of the sons of Shaikh Khaza’al of Ivluhammarah. Shepherd has given the following account of him:- 'He speaks fair English and gives his age as 36. Having passed through the Iraqi Military College he served as an officer in the Iraqi army from 1936- 41. In 1942 he was employed by the Public Relations Bureau of this Embassy; there is no record of the value to the Embassy of his services.' 2. We first considered obtaining employment for him with one of the oil companies but there was much opposition from his brother Abdullah, who is employed by the Kuv/ait Oil Company. I then asked Shepherd whether Luhammad Sa’id v/ould accept any employment of a military nature and have heard that he responded to the suggestion with keenness, averring that he was a soldier and well able to cope with deserts and hot climates. I am accordingly v/ondering whether there would be any opening for him in the nuscat Infantry, and I should be glad to have your views on this point. There v/ould be no objection to your mentioning it as a very tentative suggestion to Woods-Ballard or Camp bell, or both. Major F. C. L.
