The first of the ships that opened British commercial intercourse with the Persian Gulf started from the Surat factory of the East India Company. Here was established a small marine, that afterwards developed into the Bombay Marine, called since 1830 the Indian Navy, which was abolished in 1862. To this Indian Navy we are mainly indebted for the breakdown of the Portuguese power on the Persian Gulf, the protection of the British commerce against the rivalry of the Dutch and the French, the suppression of piracies and the establish ment of maritime peace, and security of navigation by its surveys, in the Gulf. The record of its origin and rise, its struggles and victories is given in the exhaustive and admirable history of the Indian Navy by C. R. Low. We must be content here with only a synopsis of the principal events in the Gulf in which the Indian Navy figured and the surveys done by its officers in the shape of two statements. PERIOD I.

The Sphinx, Pigeon and Plassey employed in operations against the Ali-bin-Ali tribe at Zobarra in July to September 1895. (See Bahrein Precis, 18S4 — 1904, Chapter XXXIV.) In March 1896, Major Saddler visited Dhofar in the Brisk to endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between the rebels and the Sultan at Maskat. (See Maskat Precis, 1892— /905t Chapter VIII (iii).) The Brisk and Cossack (with the Lawrence) employed in con nection with the rebellion in Dhofar. (See Chapter VIII of the Maskat Precis, 1892—1905,) The Lapwing placed on the Shat-el-Arab in the autumn. The Pigeon placed on the Shat-el-Arab from June to December 1897, almost continuously to protect the British Indian boats from pirates. After this, it proceeded to the Mekran coast with a party, who took part in the expedition in connection with Mr. Graves' murder. (See Mekran Precis.) The Lapwing effected the capture of arms and ammunition on hoaxA. Xhe. Baluchistan, (See Trade Precis, pages 11 et seq.). The Redbreast placed on duty on the Shat-el-Arab from October. For many years no large ship had visited the Gulf and the presence of the Eclipse was believed to have had a good effect. • The Sphinx, Redbreast and the Eclipse were employed in January and February 1899 in connection with the crisis at Maskat. (See Chapter XVIII of the Maskat Precis, 1892— 1903) The Redbreast placed on duty on the Sbat-el-Arab from September to December 1900. 1288F D11 CHAPTER III.

Gulfi of overawi the s|ave traders the tast Coast of Africa, and of cruising in the Red Sea. should devolve upon vessels belonging to the Royal Navy. Practically, however, this change was not found to work well. The limits of the East India Station were so extensive the climate in many parts so detrimental to health, and the calls made bv local authorities upon the Commodore for ships of war were often so numerous that an efficient supervision was out of the question. There was always more work than the squadron could undertake, and the shortcomings of the new system were brought to the notice of the Supreme Government. We may note the various occasions on which the Government of Bombay and the Political Ao-ents under its control were crippled for want of naval means to enforce their orders. 4. In July 1863, Her Majesty's ship Pantaloon, which, under the new Political Proceedings, March 1864, Nos. 3 -11. arrangement, had been stationed in the Red was taken away, and for some months the Commodore was unable tq send a substitute, his squadron havino- been weakened by the necessity of sending several sloops to the eastward 3 Nothing then remained at the disposal of the Resident at Aden., but the Govern ment Steamer Victorici and this vessel was under orders in September for the Mekran Coast to lay out a special survey in accordance with the instructions of the Secretary of State. Meanwhile the slave trade in the Red Sea was beincr carried on with increased activity, and the British merchants at Hodeida were trembling for their safety, in consequence of an anticipated attack by the Aseers, the most powerful tribe in Yemen, and the knowledge that no vessel was available for their protection. The absence, too, of a ship of war at Aden had been severely felt on the occasion of the stranding of the Peninsula and Oriental Company's Steamer Rangoon, Had there then been a steamer avail able, it was probable that she could have been tugged into harbour at once, but as it was, she had to wait till help was forthcoming, to the great risk of her No. 4, dated 13th January x864. lj P on these grounds the Govern ment of Bombay urged the Secretary of State to follow the example by which the Pleiad had been allotted to Zanzibar and the Clyde and Sir Hugh Rose temporarily to the Persian Gulf, and to No. 46, dated 8th April 1868, to Secretary of allow a similar indulo'enCe for Aden State (Political). .-p. ^ , c t t ... 1 he Government of India, in brmgino- these facts to the notice of the Home authorities, contented itself with express ing a wish that the Admiralty would be speedy in providing for the defence of No. ae, dated 30th June 1864 (Marine), j] 16 Indian Seas, lo these references the Secretary of State replied that, by the separation of the East India and China Stations of the Royal Navy, and by the union of the latter to the Cape of Good Hope Station, there was every reason to expect that the Admiral at Bombay would be better able in future to meet the calls made upon him for the Indian Seas. Should the force at the disposal still prove to be insufficient, it would be his duty to ask for additional ships from the Admiralty. Sir Charles Wood, however, saw no reason for giving the local Residents permanent control of war ships, and therefore not only declined to accede to the application of the Bombay Government for a steamer at Aden but recalled the Pleiad from Zanzibar, and ordered that the Clyde and the Sir Hugh Rose should only be kept in the Persian Gulf so long as their services were required inlaying the submarine cable. • Borrowed partly from a note by Mr. Girdlestone, dated a^th February 1869.12 r. On the 20th of March 1864, Mr. Colquhoun, Her Majesty s Consul- General at Cairo, wrote direct to Colonel Political Proceedings, May 1864, Nos, 156-158. ]y[ erew ether, the Agent at Aden, that he had Lord Russell's instructions to request him to use any means at his command for procuring the release of Mr. Cameron and his fellow -prisoners from the captivity in which they had been arbitrarily detained by Iheooore, King of Abyssinia. To this Colonel Merewether answered, that it was quite out of his power to render the assistance asked of him, as there was no Government steam vessel in the harbour, and no man -of-war on the station. The Hornet had been at Aden for a short time, but had only recently been recalled to Bombay, and, so far as he knew, there was no likelihood of its being replaced. The matter was at once laid before the Supreme Government, and, in accordance with the suggestion of the Viceroy and Governor General in Council, the responsible officer on the Bombay Coast was asked to send a man-cf-war to the nearest point on the Abyssinian Coast, so as to Political Proceedings, July ,864, Nos. 163.4. give weight by its presence to any letter which might be addressed to the King. Meanwhile a requisition for^ help, o , n ,1 • 1 1 m t* based on the rumour of an outrage in the Political Proceedings, July 1804, Nos. 101-62. i i i • . i o U Red Sea to a vessel bearing the British flag, had been made to the Commodore, and he had pleaded more urgent employ ment elsewhere as his reason for not complying with the application. 6. On the 13th of May 1864, the Government of Bombay forwarded, for No. 15 of that date; also Political Proceedings the Consideration of Her iMajCSty S GoV- of Government of India, May 1864, Nos. 169-70. ernment, certain suggestions made by the Political Agents at Zanzibar and Bushire for more eftectually stopping the exportation of slaves from the east coast of Africa. In his Memorandum on the subject, Colonel Pelly, speaking for the Persian Gulf, remarked that he had not possessed the means during the past year of seizing slaving craft entering these waters, but from what he had heard, he entertained little doubt that numerous slaves had in this, as in all previous years, been imported from Africa. Jud ging by the dates, it seems likely that these papers had come under the notice of the Secretary of State before he wrote his despatch of June 30th, 1864. No. 52, &lt;1ated 28th October 1S65, with enclosure, ^ h ' S arguments had evidently llOt from Government of Bombay to Secretary of satisfied the Bombay Government, for, State- on the 9th December 1864, it addressed a circular letter to the Political Agents within its jurisdiction, enquiring whether they still deemed it needful to retain 'a small steamer or other vessel' for their respective requirements. The Resident at Aden replied that, out of eighteen months ending with the 14th of September 1864, the total length of stay of all the vessels of the Royal Navy which had come into the harbour, had not amounted to three months. During the prevalence of the south-west monsoon, the rendezvous was far away at Trincomalee. But even if a ship of the Royal Navy could be spared for Aden all the year round, of which he saw no prob ability, he would still wish to have some smaller craft at the Resident's uncon trolled disposal to take him at all seasons wherever his presence might be needed. The Resident at Bushire observed that, though the Government had expressly constituted the holder of his office arbitrator in all differences arising amongst the Chiefs of the Arab Coast, whether at sea or on land, he was in reality powerless to perform his functions in the absence of suitable means of locomo tion. In the season of the pearl fishing, from April to October, when disputes were frequent, the ships of the Royal Navy were forbidden by the standing orders of the Admirality from cruising in the Gulf. The Arabs would not be slow to take advantage of the Resident's inability to roam about at will, and so the Gulf would in time become as insecure as ever it had been in old days. He therefore trusted that the Resident might have at his command a vessel to enable him to discharge his political duties properly. The Agents at Maskatand Zan zibar were equally in favour of the measure. Accordingly the Bombay Govern ment forwarded their answers in extenso to England, and, as an additional proof of the necessity for granting the concession, called attention to the hostile attitude of the Wahabees in Oman at the date of sending its despatch. 7. In May 1865, Mr. Calvert, the Acting Consul at Jedda, represented Political Proceedings, June 1865, Nos. 99*101. through the Bombay Government that many or the ships which carried pilgrimsfrom the Straits Settlements to the Red Sea were systematically overcrowded, in violation of the provisions of Act XXI of 1858, and he suggested that cruisers should be stationed off the Babel Mandeb Channel to search any vessels sailing under British colours, so as to ascertain whether the passengers on board were in excess of the number sanctioned by law. To this proposal the Govern ment of India replied that it had no vessels for this duty, even if it were expedient so to employ them. 8. During the same year repeated applications were made by the Political Keep-with to Political Proceedings, December Agent for the permanent retention of a 1865, Nos. )8i 90. man-of-war at Aden, for the control of the tribes in the neighbourhood, and especially of the predatory Foodhlees, who, it was thought, could best be coerced from the sea-ooard. The urgency of the case was again pressed upon the Secretary of State by the Government in the Office Memorandum from Home Department, Home Department, and in AugUSt 1 866 No. 3552, dated9th August 1866. an answer was returned that the Lords of the Admiralty could not undertake to keep a ship constantly on the station, but that the spot should be visited as often as was compatible with the other duties of the squadron, \ g. Towards the end of 1865 a body of Wahabees made an inroad upon Political Proceedings, March .866, No,. .74-88. S ° ha r ^ ° ther P IaCeS Under the d O m inioH of the Sultan of Maskat, and it was necessary for the Resident to decide quickly what mode of punishment should be adopted.^ Colonel Pelly himself was in favour of blockading the Wahabee ports of Ojair and Katif, and the intermediate Island of Demaum, on which were fortifications commanding Katif. In putting this plan into practice, however, there was this difficulty, that the time of the Highflyer, the only vessel available in the Persian Gulf, was limited, and both Captain Pasley, w r ho comman ded her, and the Resident were disinclined to initiate operations which they could not be sure that it would be convenient to carry to a conclusion. ' To act other wise, ' remarked the latter, ' would be to confirm the impression already too prevalent of our absence of naval power, and would leave our ally, the Sultan, more than ever liable to Wahabee aggression.' It was therefore thought wiser in the end to attack Katif and Demaum after giving time to the offenders to make satisfaction had they chosen to do so, but from want of sufficient force the measures taken were not wholly successful. In reporting the results of the cruise to the Government of Bombay, the Commodore took occa« *-ru r . c 7 j' • sion' to point out the benefit which * The Gorernment of India, in commenting on ^ • r&gt; i . . , iv.wl vvtiicu these proceedings, expressed its opinion that Captain Pasley might have derived had Colone Peily certainly ought to have .ailed with he been accompanied by Colonel Pellv. Captain Pasley, or if ms presence at Maskat was Irryi . impe.iiive, that tte attack on Demaum, when a i he (jrOVemor 01 Bombay was impressed postponed 1116 was eX?er!enced ' shouid haTe been with the justice of the remark, and in a Political Proceedings April 1866, Nos 1 -3. Minute dated February 24th, 1866, record ed his sense of the disadvantages under which captains of Her Majesty's ships cruising in the Persian Gulf laboured for want of officers acquainted with the local politics, the habits and feelings of the maritime tribes, and the navigation of this difficult arm of the sea. As the Resident was not able on every occasion to be present with an expedition, he therefore suggested the propriety of having a class of officers to act as sailing masters and interpreters in the Gulf or elsewhere on the Arabian Coast, and to be at the disposal of Her Majesty's ships whenever their services were required. Mr. B. H. Ellis, in a Minute on the same subject, recommended that the evil should be remedied by increasing the strength of the Political Staff in the Persian Gulf, and leaving the duty of navagating Her Majesty's ships to skilled Arab pilots. In this view the Gov ernment of India coincided, and two assistants were subsequentlv allowed to Colonel Pelly. 10. There are several Indications that in the disturbances which were rife at Maskat after the death of Syud Thoweynee in the spring of 1866, the local authorities were put to great straits for want of adequate naval force on the first outbreak, when the property and even the lives of British subjects were in Political Proceedings, March .866, No S . ,9.-9=. dan g er - Th , e M armed steamer was the only craft on which the -Christian families resident at Maskat could take refuge, and she had to start 1288FDH away from tlie harbour after dark, in order not to attract attention. When the news of the insurrection reached Bombay, the a steam transport belonging to the Bombay Marine, was the only vessel avadable for the moment and some days elapsed, indeed, before she was pronounced ready for sea. Almost simultaneously with her arrival at Mussendom, but not till after the refugees from Maskat had reached that port, came Political Proceedirgs, April 1866, Ncs. 31-48. j_j er Majesty's ships Highflyer and Octavia These latter at once set out on a cruise, and their ^ presence ^ along the Western Coast of the Persian Gulf had a marked influence in preserving order. The Clyde and Hugh Rose were told off as guard-boats at Gwadur and Mussen- dom, it being contrary to the orders of the Admiralty to leave a vessel of war for the permanent defence of these telegraph stations. These arrangements, promptly sanctioned and carried into effect, tended in some degree to relieve the Resident's anxiety ; but the risk which had been run made him recur in forcible language to the absolute necessity of giving him greater resources for compelling obedience to his orders. ' The way to provide for the maritime police of the Gulf,' he wrote to the Bombay Government towards the end ^ of March, ' is to have'an armed vessel at the disposal of your representative in the Gulf—such vessel to be adapted for coasting work, to be efficiently armed and manned from England, and to be under the orders of the Indian Government. _ Her Majesty's troops come out to India for long terms, and serve under the Indian Government; work would be much facilitated if the same rule obtained in regard to Her Majes ty's ships of war. If this cannot be, then the next best thing might, perhaps, be to have an Indian Naval Staff Corps serving aboard vessels built for the Indian Government, but built in England with all the modern fittings and improvements of the English Dockyard.' 11, The removal of Her Majesty's Ship Lyra from Aden in April 1S66 was the cause of another strong appeal from the Political Proceedings, June, 1866, No. 90. Government of Bombay to the Secretary of State. The Foodhlee tribe had not then tendered their submission, and there was no saying what their next move would be. Under these circumstances, though the Governor in Council did not think the case sufficiently urgent to justify him in countermanding the orders of the Commodore, he intimated plainly his desire that Aden should not continue to be deprived periodically of its means of protection. The place which was formerly the head-quarters of a squadron stood its chance now of having a ship of war for four months in the year. Yet its importance was as great at ever, and actually the French, \uth fewer interests to serve and less commerce to protect, had for nearly three years past maintained a fully equipped gunboat on the station. Finally the argument that the western coast of India was, during the south-west monsoon, unhealthy for English sailors, and that on this account Trincomalee was the place of resort during the hot and rainy season, did not apply to Aden, where there was never any great amount of rain or heat, but, on the contrary, a refreshing sea breeze which kept down the thermometer both by day and by night. 12. The coercive measures which it had been found necessary to adopt of d a ' n ^ ,c^ k- , o late in the Persian Gulf had made the Proceedings, October icoo, No. 178. .... &lt;• ^7 • 1 European inhabitants of Zanzibar apprehen sive lest the Arabs, who annually came to that port in great numbers, armed to the teeth, should wreak their vengeance on an unoffending and defenceless popu lation. They therefore, in August 1866, entreated through Colonel Playfair, Her Majesty's Consul and Political Agent, that, during the approaching season, some vessel might be permanently stationed off the island. After some correspondence, Political Proceedings, March 1867, No. 34-?. Her MajCSty S Ship Wasp was told off tO Political f-roceedmgs, March 1867, No. 88 and this service, but did not arrive at Zanzibar IN O 22 apparently till late in November. In Feb- ruary 1867 the dubious aspect of affairs at Shahah, where the rivals of the tribe in possession were blockading the harbour, made the Resident at Aden again send an earnest requisition for a ship of war to be placed at his disposal. In the absence of the Highflyer , which had sailed away during the previous Novenfibei, he had nothing to rely upon but the steam-boat Victoria, which, though she cairied four guns, had no trained crew to work them. The answer he15 received from the Commodore at Bombay on the 9th of March was, that the only vessel at his disposal was for the moment in dock, but that it was hoped she would be ready tor sea by the end of the month, when she would be at once des patched to Aden to watch the progress of events. 13. In the beginning of December 1867, Colonel Pelly called the attention Poiiticai proceedings, February 1868, Nos. 137- of Government to a serious breach of the 39 ' _ peace which had just taken place in the Persian Gulf at the instigation of the Chiefs of Aboothabee and Bahrein. He animadverted on the fact that the Hugh Rose, which was not able to run under steam more than eight hours consecutively, and which was manned by a native crew was the only vessel at hand for enforcing peace amongst his turbulent neigh bours. Notwithstanding the weakness of his position he advised that Aboothabee should be blockaded, in order that the Chief and his tribesmen might be debarred from the pearl fishery, and so be put to sensible loss ; but the Government of Bom bay at once replied that such a course, however desirable, was out of the question when there was not the means to carry it through efficiently. Every available ship on the station had been sent to Annesley Bay in connection with the Abyssinian Expedition ; but the want was so imperative, that the Government of India at once enquired from Commodore Helth whether he could not detach one vessel from his squadron. 14. Meanwhile the Shah of Persia, who was utterly without the power to Political Pio:eedings 1 June .868, No,. ,..-.6. P r0teCt ^ sub jeCts' property at sea, had been cogitating over the expediency of obtaining from Europe some small ships of war, and in the end had inclined to the plan suggested by Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran of getting out armed steamers at intervals from England and having them commanded by English officers. But to this project the Supreme Government saw objections, and in the interests of Persia, equally with those of India, recommended the establish ment of a small marine force exclusively for operations in and about the Persian Gulf. ' Such a force,' it was remarked in the despatch on the subject, ' would more effectually secure the Shah's real interest than any force of his own, while it would give stability to our ascendancy in the Gulf, which, ever since the aboli tion of the local navy, there has been some risk of our losing, and would exclude all pretext for the intervention of other powers. * » « It is chiefly from the absence of such a force that present political complications between the Gov ernments of Persia and Maskat and between several of the maritime tribes have arisen, and it is in our opinion impossible for the peace of the Gulf to be maintained and trade protected unless the Resident at Bushire has at his command the means of enforcing the terms of the maritime truce. The question is one of vital importance to our political position in the Gulf, and it is matter of much regret to us that, when the Indian Navy was abolished, some special arrangements were Letter from Colonel Pelly to the i-ovemment of not made by the maintenance of a small Bombay, No. 96 of 1808, paragraph jo. force for the protection of our interests in these seas.' The question was referred for the opinion of the Lords of the Secret despatch No. 15, dated December ^b, Admiralty and the Secretary of State for 1868, with enc osures. Foreign Affairs, both of whom were oppos ed to any change in the existing system. The old arguments which led to the abolition of the Indian Navy were reiterated, and a further point was raised, that it was of importance for vessels of war, which might at any time be brought into contact with vessels of other European Powers visiting Indian Seas, to be under the direct control of the Government at home, and under the responsibility of the Senior Naval Officer of the station. The Secretary of State for India, however, left it for the consideration of the Supreme Government whether a cer tain number of gun-boats commissioned by the Admiralty, and manned mostly by lascars, and native marines, but under the orders of the Indian authorities, might not answer the purpose. He had reasons to believe that such a measure, if acceptable to the Viceroy and his Council, would meet with no opposition at home. 14-A. As regards the ambition of the Shah of Persia to purchase gunboats, p..,. 1A . tC &lt;-o M ( 0 the Minister at Teheran was told that he Political A., jun« 1S08, Nos lio-io. 1 ^ 1 t 11^,,., should endeavour to dissuade the Shah fromi6 carrying out his idea, but if he could not do so ^^Govemment naval officer, who should proceed to Tehran and advl f® was t0 pay as to the cost and other deta&gt; s ot the 'f'^X^nce o Rs Ts The Shah for this officer's journey and give him a daily allowance o J3 declined this offer. ic In i86 q one of the Maskat Sultan's rivals plundered Bunder Abbas 'S- ln '^9 one 01 sacked the Government House and then got Z°£°'away by sea. This event naturally increased the Shah's desire for a navy, and the Minister at lehran ^ned tha e Persian Government wished to obtain vessels of war from trance, one ot tne obiects being the recovery ot Bahrein. Much as Government objected to the establishment of a Persian Navy In the Gulf, U was thought less d ^ ble this Navy should be established by another European power and it was resolved if necessary, to give the Shah one ship, but he appears to have abandoned the (ii) Arrangements for a naval force for the Gulf. 16. The arrangements finally made by the Home Government are shown in the correspondence received with the Uuke Political A., January 1870, Nos. 147-54. ^ ^gyU's despatch No. 235, dated 31 St August 1869. 17. U appears that the Secretary of State for India had assented to a proposal that a capitation grant of ^ 10 per man should be paid yearly out o^the Indian funds, on account of six of Her Majesty's vessels to be employed m Indian waters in general, three of which would be detailed for constarit and exclusive service in the Persian Gulf and adjacent waters, to be under the immediate control of the Government of India, the other three also being at their disposal whenever, and so far as, the requirements of the Imperial service would per mit. But as the payment ot a capitation rate for a variable number of men would involve the keeping of elaborate accounts between the India Office and the Admiralty, and email much clerical labour, the Admiralty proposed that a fixed sum of £70,000 should be paid yearly out of Indian lunds for the above service from date to be named hereafter, it being understood that no larger sum was at any time to be chargeable against the Indian Government without the previous assent ot the Secretary of State for India in Council, and that the Admiralty would bear the whole expense off the wear and tear of the hulls, rigging, machinery, and stores of the ships. Should any doubt at any time arise on the part of the _ Indian Government as to the stipulated number of six vessls having been maintained as agreed upon, the Admiralty would consider themselves bound to establish the fact, and a pro portionate reduction of the contribution would be made if the number of ships should not have been kept up. It was understood that the Indian Government would defray all expenses which might be incurred on shore by the officers and men of Her Majesty's ships whilst they might be employed on any service, in compliance with requisi tions from the India Office. With regard to the repair and maintenance of Her Majesty's ships to be employed in Indian waters, it was to be understood that the free use of the dockyard at Bombay should be given to all Her Majesty's ships on the station, that the Indian Government should pay the expense of labour incurred and materials supplied at that dockyard with regard to the three vessels to be employed exclusively in the Persian Gulf and waters adjacent, and that the said three vessels should always be supplied with coal at the cost of the Indian Government. 18. A copy of the instructions which the Admiralty proposed to address to the Senior Officer of Her Majesty's Ships on the East India Station, relative to •The idea was revived in 1883, when Murteza Khan, son of the Minister Mui&lt;ber-ed-Dowleh, was sent to Europe ^ t oa- w . 1 » 1. to purchase a gun-boat and two small steamers.

On page 356 of the same volume will be found description of tRe Susa,! 7 the duties of the officers in command of the vessels employed on the service above referred to, was transmitted for the consideration of the Duke of Argyll— Draft Instructions for the Senior Officer on the East India Station. You are to place yourself in communication with the Governor-General of India, the Governors of the Presidencies of Bombay and Madras, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and the Governors of Mauritius and Ceylon, and you are to communicate with them freely as occasion may require, co-operating with them in the most cordial manner for the benefit of the Queen's service and for the protection ol British trade and possessions. 2. You will comply with any requisitions for naval assistance which they may make upon you, and which it may be in your power to afford consistently with your opinion of the other requirements of the service on the station. Should the nature of those require ments render non-compliance with the demands of the local authorities at any lime inevitable, you will, on all such occasions, explain, as far as you consider your instructions from the Admiralty will allow you, the nature of the circumstances which prevent a compliance with requisitions from Indian authorities. 3. You will appropriate of the small vessels under your orders for Wit suppression pf the slave trde on the east coast of Africa. 4. In consequence of an arrangement with the Indian Government, a portion of the cost of the naval squadron on the East India Station, consisting of six vessels in addition to the three above mentionedy will be paid out of the Ind'an revenues. 5. Of those six, you at once will detach three gunvessels or gun-boats, steamers, for constant and exclusive service in the Persian Gulf. 6. They will, when necessary, visit Bombay for repair or sanitary or other purposes according to such orders as you may give from time to time. 7. These three vessels are to maintain the police of the waters of the Persian Gulf and to prevent the Arab Chiefs of the coast from rendering the trade and navigation insecure by their piratical expeditions. These Chiefs are bound by treaty not to engage in hostilities at sea. All expeditions for this purpose will be restrained by these gun-boats, and the Chiefs will not be allowed to engage in the slave trade. 8. As difficulties are apt to arise suddenly, requiring prompt action, the Commanders of these gun-boats are to consider themselves at the disposal of the British Resident, or such other local authority as the Government of India may appoint, for the maintenance of the maritime police of these waters, and for the support of British authority. g. The Resident or other local authority will be well acquainted with the habits of the people and well qualified to judge as to the course to be pursued in dealing with the Native Princes and people, and Commanding Officers will understand that they are not to adopt any aggressive measures without the sanction of such authority. 10. Commanding Officers will be themselves responsible if they undertake any hostile operation without a reasonable prospect of success, or when the lives of the men under their orders might be unduly exposed to danger. 11. Commanding Officers of ships employed in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian and Red Seas are to comply with the requisitions of the Viceroy of India and the Governors of Madras and Bombay, and such other local authorities as the Government of India may determine. 12. If compliance with these requisitions should, in exceptional cases, interfere with the order of the Senior Officer, they must look to the relati/e importance of the services, and exercise their own discretion, bearing in mind the Admiralty instructions, Article 44, Chapter 44, page 336, and reporting their proceedings and their reasons for the course they may adopt. 13. The general rule for the guidance of Her Majesty's Naval Officers on this station as on all others is. that acts of hostility are not to be engaged in without the authority of the Senior Officer of the station, but it is so obvious that this rule cannot apply to the vessels employed under the circumstances above explained in the Persian Gulf. 14. Native Princes and people with whom Naval Officers may have to communicate are to be treated with courtesy and consideration. 15. You will be charged generally with the protection of trade, and the defence of the coast and shipping, and the execution of measures for the suppression of the slave trade, so far as these several duties depend on the assistance of ships of war. 16. The Senior Officer will make Bombay his head-quarters, visiting, from time to time, Calcutta, Trincomallee the Mauritius, and other parts of the station, and will, as far as possible, avoid keeping the squadron at Bombay during the rainy and unhealthy season I288FDi8 17. You will make such arrangements for the disposition of the squadron, changing the stations of the ships, including those employed in the Persian Gulf, as may appear to you to be best calculated to preserve the health and efficiency of the crews, and you are in all cases to endeavour to keep the local authorities informed of any orders which you may give for the removal of any vessel (especially those in the Persian Gulf) for sanitary reasons or otherwise, 19. The Duke of Argyll agreed to the terms proposed and approved of the draft instructions above quoted, but suggested that the arrangement might be considered temporary and provisional (Despatch to the Admiralty dated 26th August 1869.)

Bullfinch, informed Colonel Pelly that he had been sent to assist in the duties hitherto performed by the vessels belonging to the Indian Government and for warded the following instructions received from his Commander-in-Chief;— Dated on board the Farie at Bombay, nth April 1871. Instructions by JAMES H or SFGRD cogkburn, Esq., Rear-Admiral of Her Majesty's Fleet, and Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Ships and Vessels employed, and to be employed) on the East India Station, to be observed by Officers Commanding Her Majesty's Ships employed on special service in the Persian Gulf. The vessels employed on this service are to maintain the police of the waters of the Persian Gulf, and to prevent the Arab Chiefs of the Coast from rendering the trade and navigation insecure by their piratical expeditions. These Chiefs are bound by Treaty not to engage in hostilities at sea. AH expeditions for this purpose are to be restrained by Her Majesty's gun-vessels, and the Chiefs are not to be allowed to engage in the slave trade. 2. As difficulties are apt to arise suddenly, requiring prompt action for the mainte nance of order m these waters, you are to consider yourself at the disposal of the British Kesident or i olitiCcU Agent for the support oi British authority. 3. The Resident or other local authority being well acquainted with the habits of the people, and well qualified to judge as to the course to be pursued in dealing with the iNative Princes and people, Commanding Officers will understand that they are not to adopt any aggressive measures without the sanction of such authority. 4. Commanding Officers will be themselves responsible it they undertake any hostile operat.on wtthout reasonable prospect of success, or when the lives of the men under their orders might be unduly exposed to danger. nn 5 ' for the g uida n ce of Her Majesty's Naval officers on this station tL rnL* a J- 8 TK f t .

HARRIS, Secretary, U wi'I he noted that the main objects of employing Royal Navy vessels in the Gulf are indicated on the above instructions to be (1) policing the waters of the Gulf and restraming piracies and hostilities by sea by the Arab C lefs and (2) preventing the Chiefs from engaging in slave trade.19 CHAPTER IV. Rules for the relief of Royal Navy vessels in the Persian Gulf, 1874-75. 22. The following rules were issued by Rear-Admiral A. Gumming, Com- Poiiticai a, september 1874, Nos. 101-102. mander-in-Chief of Her Majesty s Naval Forces, to the Commanding Officers of Her Majesty s ships in the Gulf on 1st May 1874. The ships detailed for service in the Persian Gulf and adjacent water requiring more constant relief and change in order to keep them in an efficient state, and also for sanitary purposes, the following orders with respect to these vessels are to be carried out as far as possible by the senior officer of the Gulf Squadron, and he will fully report from time to time in his letters or proceedings the steps he takes in consequence : — 1. Three ships will be detached for service in this division. Of these two are con stantly to be kept in the Gulf or the adjacent waters as may be necessary; the third ship is to be allowed to be aDsent either at Kurrachee or Bombay, or on passage to or from either of those ports. 2. Each ship composing the squadron is to be relieved in succession, and, if possible, each ship should visit Kurrachee or Bombay every four months. 3 On a ship leaving for Kurrachee or Bombay, the senior officer remaining in the Gulf should be informed on what date she would probably sail again for the Gulf and arrangements made as to the port to which she should return. This port should,' as a rule, be on the east coast, in order that her arrival may be telegraphed from Gwadur or Charbar to the other stations, and all ships should call at one of these ports for this purpose. Should, however, the senior officer have ordered the ships to proceed direct to Muscat he must make arrangements for her arrival being made known as soon as possible. Should the ship be delayed at Kurrachee or Bombay, the senior officer in the Gulf should be informed, with as little delay as possible, either by letter or telegram. 4. The Commanding Officer of the ship leaving the Gulf should be informed of any stores, provisions, or money which it may be necessary to bring from Kurrachee or Bombay for the ships remaining, timely demands being forwarded by each ship to Bombay as directed in Article 8. 5. Great care is to be taken by the ship when at Kurrachee or Bombay to obtain sufficient stores, provisions and money, to last until their return to one of those ports* few things being obtainable in the Gulf except fresh provisions. 6. Orders should be sent by telegraph, or otherwise, to Charbar or Gwadur, as to the destination of the ship arriving, and the senior officer will make arrangements for the departure of the next ship from the Gulf. 7. The ship visiting Kurrachee or Bombay should be allowed to remain 10 days or a fortnight, but every effort is to be made for her return at the time fixed previous to her departure from the Gulf, and any delay is to be immediately reported as directed in Article 3. 8. Ships should visit Kurrachee in preference to Bombay when no Dockyard work is necessary. Demands are to be sent to the contractors at Bombay for such provisions as will be required of Kurrachee , stating by what date these stores should be at that port. These demands should be sent as early as possible as special arrangements have been made with the British India Steam Navigation Company for freight, and this Company will place any stores in the Custom House at Kurrachee to await the arrival of the ship requiring them, should they arrive before her. Timely demands should also be sent for any stores required from the Bombay Dock yard and they will be forwarded and stored in a similar manner to the provisions. 9. The Commanding Officer of the ships in this division will be careful to keep the senior officer as well as the Commander-in-Chief constantly acquainted with their move ments. The Political Resident in the Gulf is also to be informed of the movements of the ships. The requisitions made by the Political Resident and Agents of course must be most carefully attended to, but should they materially interfere with the system of relief, Commanding Officers should point out to these officers what appears to them the best means for meeting both requirements, informing them that these orders have been given with the view of affording an efficient suqadron, and requesting their co-operation in attaining this object.20 to. In making passages steam should be used in aecordance . w!t h th « ^miralty instructions and circulars, but the senior officer may grant permission for the most econo mical speed being exceeded in urgent cases. 11. All expenses for telegrams, freight, storage, etc., incurred in carriyng out these orders are to appear in the monthly return of unauthorized payments. 12. Acopy of these orders is supplied to the Commanding Officer of each ship in the Gulf Squadron—when finally relieved, he is to transfer them to his successor. Dated Glasgow at Sea, the 15th May 1874. Extract, paragraph 3, from a letter from Rear-Admiral A. Cumming, Commander-in^ Chief of Her Majesty's Naval Forces in India, to COLONEL H. K. BURNE, Secretary to the Govtrnment of India, Marine Department, Calcutta, Paragraph 3.-^ sincerely trust that the plan of relief which I am endeavouring to institute will meet with the approval of His Excellency the Governor-Genera in Council and that the Political Resident and Agents in the Persian Gulf may be enabled to assist the Commanders of Her Majesty's ships in carrying this out. It is, I am sure, quite im^ possible to maintain a healthy and efficient squadron in those waters, unless periodical change is allowed, and when this is done, I have but little doubt but that we shall constant ly have two out of the three ships ready for any emergency, and this appears to meet the requirements contained in your letter No. 11 of 3rd February 1871, addressed to the Naval Commander-in-Chief. No, I474-P-, dated Fort William, the nth July 1874. Endorsed by Foreign Department. COPY forwarded to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, for information and guidance, 23. The second portion of Rule 9 of the rules for the guidance of command* ing officers of Her Majesty's vessels in Political a., February 187S, Nos. ^ p ers J an Q^f \ s as follows : « The requisitions made by the Political Resident and Agents of course must be carefully attended to, but should they materially interfere with the system of relief, command- in^ officers should point out to these officers what appears to them the best means for meeting both requirements, informing them that these orders have been given with the view of affording an efficient squadron, and requesting their co-operation in attaining this object. The ' system of relief ' above referred to is that of the three ships of which the Gulf squadron consisted, each ship was to be relieved in succession, and, if possible, to v^it Kurrachee or Bombay every four months. 24. On the 20th August, Colonel Ross sent an urgent telegraphic requisition to the Senior Naval Officer, to the effect that the presence of a man-of-war was very urgently required at Bahrein. It was ten days before the vessel detailed for the service left Karachi, and three weeks before she reached Bahrein. Meanwhile a dangerous crisis had occurred, and It Is said that the only reason for not immediately complying with the requisition was that It would interfere with the system of relief. 25. On this statement of fact Colonel Ross argued that the system of rigorously carrying out the rules for the relief of these vessels might cause serious difficulties to the political position In the Gulf, and he suggested that • &lt;( ^ should be understood what class of duties is to be considered of paramount importance by the Naval Commanders and to what extent it is intended they should exercise the discretionary authority vested in them, where important requisitions are made by the local representatives of the Government of India.' 26. The Government of India passed the following orders on the suggestions made by the Resident (No. 246-Politlcal, dated 26th January 1875) - No. 246 -P., dated Fort William, 26th January 1875. From—C. U. Aitchison , Esq., C.S.I., Secy, to the Govt, of India, Foreign Dept., To— Lieut.-Col . E. C. Ross , H. B. M.'s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1055-219, dated 18th September 1874, inviting attention to certain points connected with the rules for the relief of the Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf.21 2 : F ^ om th f.P a P ers , su , bmitted ^ a PP e ars that, on the 20th August last, you sent an urgent telegraphic requisition to the Senior Naval Officer, to the effect that the presence of a man-of-war was very urgently required at Bahrein. The vessel did not leave Kurrachee for ien days and only reached Bahrein in three weeks. Meanwhile a crisis had occurred and it is said that the only reason for not immediately complying with the requisition was that is would interfere with the system of naval relief. 1 ^ 0 ^ &lt; 3' 0n this ^atement you represent that the system of relief if rigorously carried out rmght cause serious difficulties to the political possition of the British Government in the Oulf, and you therefore suggest for considerationlthat ' it should be understood what class of duties is to be considered of paramount importance by the Naval Commanders, and to what extent it is intended they should exercise the discretionary authority vested in them.

Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council directs me to state that the system of relief in such a service as that of the Persian Gulf is of verv ereat importance, and that it is cot to be departed from or set aside except under grave emergency. Neither of the cases referred to by you {viz., the threatened attack on Bahremand the disputes on land between the Chiefs of Shargah and Ras-ool-Khymah) ajppears to have been of sufficient importance to necessitate exposing the crews of Her Majesty s vessels to unusual hardships. 5* Excellency in Council thinks that the requirements of such cases will be S i! ij 11161 ^ tlie followin g arrangements. All written or telegraphic requisitions should be treated as ordinary or urgent and carried out in ordinary course or urgently so far as the rules of relief admit. If you consider any requisition to be so emergent as to require immediate compliance without regard to the rules of relief, you should say so distinctly in the requisition, and should telegraph to Government the fact of your having done so with your reasons. Government can then exercise a control if the requisition be deemed injudicious. But you should be careful to note that nothing short of a grave crisis to which all rules must bend would justify you in exercising the discretion hereby 6. With reference to your letter of the 20th July last, to the address of Captain Garforth, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Squadron, I am directed by His Excellency in Council to observe that you no doubt unintentionally went beyond your proper province in commenting upon the condition of Her Majesty's Ships Philomel and Daphne as to supplies of shot and shell, etc., matters as to which the Senior Naval Officer is responsible to Government. 37. Rear-Admrial Gumming addressed the Government of India (Marine * Political a. May 1875. No. 339. Department) » expressing his thanks for the support so readily tendered to assist him in his endeavours to carry out a regular system of relief in the ships of the Persian Gulf Squadron. He thought that the arrangements detailed in paragraph 5 of the Government of India orders above quoted, whereby a difference between ' ordinary ' and ' urgent ' requisitions was drawn, would tend materially to diminish the difficulties then experienced in carrying out the onerous duties required of the small squadron in the Persian Gulf. He furhter explained that the delay in the particular case complained of by the Resident was due to the vessel in question having had to await the arrival of new boats from Bombay, he having lost three in a cyclone when on passage to Karachi from the Persian Gulf.23 CHAPTER V, East India Station Standing Orders, 1832. 28* The following extracts taken from ' East India Station Standing a p.... t tt t ce M Orders,' dated' 25th April 1882, issued A., Political Et, January 1884, Nos. 262-73. . , . , • 1 u , 1 • 1 v • n by the Admiralty are those which chiefly concern the Persian Gulf and the suppression of the slave trade ;— Article iv.

With the view Oi an accurate account being kept of the pavments due to the Admiralty, yQU are to furnish a quarterly return on the prescribed form', showing the dates of the employment of the respective vessels within the above limits, sending a duplicate at the same time to the Accountant-General and Controller of Navy Pay.

(i) Reduction in the number of Her Majesty's vessels maintained in the Indian seas and on the Indian subsidy, 1884—89, 29. In addressing the Secretary of State on the 15th August 1884, the External a .. November i 88 4i Nos. 4qo-4g i . Government of India said that they 'were or opinion that when the special Indian Marine despatch vessel should be ready, the number of Her Majesty's vessels at present maintained in the Indian seas should be reduced to five, of which two should be exclusively employed in the Gulf, so as to admit of one being occasionally absent at Bombay while refitting. It was also considered that with this reduction of strength there should be a proportionate reduction of the annual subsidy of ^70,000 now paid to the Admiralty for naval services rendered to India. In addition to the saving thus obtained, there would be a saving in the coalipg and repairs of one of Her Majesty's vessels now employed in the Persian Gulf, and it was thought that these savings would be found more than sufficient for the maintenance of the Indian Marine despatch-boat. 30. Under date the 3rd December 1884, the Secretary of State enquired ^hat further reduction could be borne in Royal Navy ships, so as to release a portion of the subsidy, to meet the probable demands on the Admiralty for torpedo and gunboat defences for Aden. In discussion it was noted that no proposal could be approved which would have the effect of reducing the Persian Gulf squadron below 3 {viz.-. — 1 Indian # s e c hapter VII. Marine* despatch-boat, f R. N. ship in Gulf, 1 refitting for the Gulf.) The Secre tary of State was informed accordingly. 31. The discussion regarding Persian Gulf requirements in the way of External A., August 18^6, No. 199. warships still continued. On the one hand, the Government of India held that 5 of Her Majesty's ships plus the new despatch-boat for the Resident in the Gulf was the number required ; on the other hand, the joint India Office and Admiralty Committee inclined to the opinion that reduction was possible, and in this view were supported by Captain Hext, for some time Senior Naval' Officer in the Gulf. The latter thought that India paid the Admiralty an immense sum annually and got next to nothing in return; he strongly held that the Sphinx and the despatch-boat Lawrence were quite enough for the Gulf service, and that two gun-boats instead of one might with perfect safety be suppressed Under these circumstances, the opinion of Colonel Ross was asked for on the proposals, 32. Colonel Ross in replying to the contemplated reductions thought that External A., Ma/ 1887, No.. 291-292. in * temporary emergency it would be possible to carry on with two vessels ; the proposed reduction would, however, be permanent and difficult to rectify if it proved a mistake. He thought that any further reduction of combatant vessels would be unwise and imprudent both for practical reasons and because it would look like indifference to our position in the Gulf, In support of this it was mentioned that during the Egyptian war our gun-vessels visited the Arab Coast infrequently and this caused comment. Finally Colonel Ross thought that the present force was the minimum compatible with efficiency and that further reduction would mean loss of status which the money saving would not justify, 33. On the other hand, Captain Hext was of opinion that the whole work of . . , t the Gulf could be done by our own t As regards the Lawrence, see Chapter . , i t ^ i r . . despatch-boat the Lawrence^ plus one man-of-war the Sphinx. In support of this he argued that if three obsolete gun-boats steaming seven knots could do the work 15 years previously, with the power of the chiefs unbroken, and piracy common, then two fast vessels with 1288FD26 modern guns steaming 12 knots would do the work now. The Resident with the Lawrence at Bushire could reach Maskat in 48 hours instead of in 80 in one of the old Admiralty ' tools.' Piracy, as formerly understood, was unknown and ships were little required; all three of them were out of the Gulf looking for slave dhows for 4 months in the year. Captain Hext was of opinion that with another ship like the Lawrence in the reserve, the Sphinx taken over from the Admiralty, and for the Indian Government to do all the work, it would be much better done and at a saving of ^15,000 a year. ^4. In despatch No. 2, dated the 8th ro. No 292, tbtd. March 1887, the Government of India stated:— ' We have Again considered whether some further reduction could not be made, and we have arrived at the conclusion that the number of vessels may well be reduced to four. One vessel is required for the Bay of Bengal, another should be stationed at Aden, a third in the Persian Gulf, and there should always be a vessel at Bombay ready for service in the Persian Gulf. In this manner the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal wouH each be watched by a ship of war, and there would always be a vessel in reserve, ready to reinforce or relieve the vessel in the Gulf, or for service elsewhere, if required, and this number we think sufficient for the ordinary requirements of India so far as our Government is concerned. We accordingly recommend that the squadron of six vessels be reduced to four, a proportionate reduction being made in the subsidy of ^70,000 which the Government of India are now required to pay to the Admiralty, the saving then effected will amount to £ 2 3i32 2 &gt; or about 3 lakhs, and will cover the expenditure which we have to provide for ; thus, without actual increase to the Indian Marine expenditure, admitting of a substantial improvement to the naval defences of India.' 35. In consequence of ihe difficulties which were constantly arising between rj , , . T 000 m &lt; the Indian and Home Governments, in External A., June 1888, Nos. 25-36. . • , i- c connection with the adjustment 01 expen diture incurred on account of the repair, docking, etc., of Royal Navy vessels on the East India station, a committee assembled in 1888 and made the following proposals :— 1. That 4 vessels be employed continually on Indian waters, of which one shall always be in the Persian Gulf. 2. That an annual subsidy payment of ^'38,500 be made by the Govern ment of India to the Admiralty, subject to a deduction of ^'28 -15 -0 a day for each vessel below the complement. 3. That the Government of India pay also the cost of extra coal consumed when in service under requisition by the Indian authorities. 4. 1 hat a further payment of 5 per cent, a year towards replacement be made on the cost price of the Sphinx, and of any future vessel constructed under special design exclusively for service in the Persian Gulf. r' 5. That when a vessel has been in dock for more than 30 days, she shall ce^se to be reckoned in the complement. 6. That all repairs be effected at the cost of the Admiralty, subject, in the case of vessels that have served in the Persian Gulf, to a propor tionate contribution by India. 7. That no charges be made for docking, except where actual outlay is incurred. 36. Tne Admiralty approved of these proposals, but as it was very probable that the cost would proportionately incrtiase if newer types of vessels carrying more expensive complements were substituted for the vessels now on the East India station, they were of op : nion that the report of the committee should be adopted for one year, and that the question should be re-opened for anv revision of the subsidy which might be necessary.2 7 37. It was found, however, from a return of (.he number of vessels in Indian External A., February 1889, Nos. 224-332. waters during the quarter ending 30th t June 1888, that more than one vessel had been at one and the same time in the Gulf during the quarter referred to. The India Office pointed out this irregularity to the Admiralty and added That it is staged that tlvse vessels are entitled to have repairs in respect of their Gulr service affected at the expense of India. This will have the effect of throwing upon Indian revenues a greater expense for repairs than was intended, when the new arrange ments were agreed to, it beiag then contemplated that only one vessel at a time should be employed in the Persian Gulf.' 38. The Admiralty upon this instructed the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Externa! a , June 1S89, Nos. £ i - S2« East India Station, to employ only one vessel at a time in future in the Persian Gulf, except at the request of the Government of India or in case of emergency. 39. In acknowledging these orders, the Naval Commander-in-Chief stated ' I hat in case I should find it necessary to station cruisers off the Arabian coast for the suppression of the slave trade, they will be considered as on special service and receive instructions to take no part in the politics of the Persian Gulf, except in case of extraordinary emergency.' (ii) Duties of the Persian Gulf squadron. Charge on account cf coal supplied to these ships while cruising outside of the Persian Gulf, 1887. 40. The total charges incurred in the operations for the suppression of the External A, A P r.i .88 7 , No,. ,72-74. ^ trad e f or the season ending October 1885 was Rs. 1,066-10-8, of which a sum of Rs. 576 was on account of the carriage of coal to H. M. S. Osprey and Rcwger while engaged in watching for slave dhows on the coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The Secretary of State was Informed that the whole amount should be met by Her Majesty's Government, but the Admiralty demurred to the item Rs. 576 being debited to the Imperial exchequer on the grounds that it w^s 'opposed to the spirit of the agreement of 1869, with regard to the maintenance of the Royal Navy in the Persian Gulf, etc.' 41. In discussion it was shown that in the present case the vessels were withdrawn from their proper duty to perform work with which the Government of India had no concern. It was therefore thought that u expenditure when employed in suppressing slave trade should be paid by the Admiralty, and further that the subsidy for the time so employed should be stopped.' Colonel Ross expressed the hope that special slave trade arrangements would be made, as 'it would not be always convenient for the vessels of the Persian Gulf squadron to be employed on this service. 51 42. It was therefore submitted that the Government of India should stand out against paying this money, and that in replying to the Secretary of State it should be pointed out that the coal in question was not sent for the use of Her Majesty's ships cruising in the Persian Gulf, but for the use of t hose ships cruising off Ras-el-Had at the mouth of the Gulf of Oman and outside the Persian Gulf, for the exclusive purpose of suppressing the slave trade. (iii) Limits of the Persian Gulf Station, 1887. 43. With reference to the intimation made to the Secretary of State that as the Political Officers in the Persian Externa! A., Septembe, .887. No.. .40-143. Gul£ ^ ^ protest against the employ . ment of Her Majesty 's vessels outside the Gulf in connection with the slave trade, the Government of India would not press the claim for Rs. 576 incurred in coaling the vessels in question. Colonel Ross explained: 'That these vessels do not as a rule go beyond the limits of the Persian Gulf: and that it Is scarcely within the legitimate functions of the Political Officers to object to the vessels proceeding on the service referred to, unlegs inconvenience were caused or other interests affected.'28 Colonel Ross added that the movements of the ships in question were effected under the orders of the Senior Naval Officer and not at any requisition of the Political Officers, though the latter were kept informed of the changes in arrangements. (iv) Inefficient condition of vessels of the Royal Navy on East India Station, 1887. 44. In despatch No. 14 (Marine Department), dated the 29th July 1887, „ , . . .. . oo kt ^ . r, the Government of India drew the atten- External A., Novamber 1887. Nos. 6060-B. . . , „ . _ , tion or the Secretary or btate to the inefficient condition of the vessels which formed the Royal Naval squadron on the East India station. This had been brought prominently to the notice of the Government of India on nearly every occasion that a vessel of the Royal Navy squadron had been required to proceed to sea during the south-west monsoon, and again quite lately when war with a European power seemed possible. From age, want of speed, weakness of armament, and antiquity of type, some of the vessels of the East India squadron were quite unsuitable for modern war purposes, and experience had proved that they were by no means fully efficient even for the police of the seas against slave traders and pirates, who used fast-sailing dhows, particularly during the south-west monsoon, or in a strong breeze, when the was no watch for fast-sailing native craft. It appeared doubtful whether there was one ship out of the squadron, which could average a speed of (o knots between Bombay and Aden even in fair weather, while, excepting the Sphinx, not one could make Aden in the monsoon direct from Bombay without going south. Many vessels which had been attached to the squadron were virtually worn out when coming on to the station, and cost a needlessly large sum in repairs and refit; and in some cases their Indian com mission had been their last. 45. In support of these statements, the following recent instances of the inefficiency of the vessels of the squadron, both for police and ordinary duties, had been brought to light. In August 1886 several small dhows were reported to be running slaves^ off the Arabian coast; the Kingfisher of the Persian Gulf squadron was required elsewhere; the complement of' the Sphinx would not admit of her detaching boats to cruise; and the Wood/nrk, the only other available vessel, was not considered by the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, suitable for use, as she could barely steam against the monsoon. Again, in July 1883, when the S. S. Kmght of the Bath was wrecked off the Arabian coast, it happened that there was no man-of-war at Aden which could be sent to the rescue. The Woodlark and the Philomel, then in the Persian Gulf, were at liberty ; but as they were not powerful enough to sream against the mon soon. it had been necessary to despatch the I. M. S. Amberwitch from Aden, to search for the shipwrecked crew and to convey them to Bombay. 46. Finally, an extract from Lord Brassey's Naval Annual for 1886* was * Psges 50-51. appended as showing the views of the , Government of India regarding the in efficiency for war purposes of some portion at any rate of the squadron 0 ;— Among the duties undertaken by the Navy, J or which it is necessary to employ vessels of a type not suited to the more important services which would be demanded Jrom the Navy m war : I may particularly mention the police of the seas in the Persian Gulf. T he service is most trying to British crews, and it could be performed efficiently by the Indian navy in vessels manned by native crews under Brihsh officers, the contribution from the Ind^ Covernment, fixed at ^o, 000 a year, is a bad bargain for the British Admiralty. The Government of India therefore urged on the attention of the Home Government, the necessity for steps being taken to replace the ships on the station by serviceable and efficient vessels of war. An opportunity of commenc ing ihis most desirable change would verv shortly present itself, for the commissions of^ the Ranger and the Kingfisher would expire in October and January respectively. It had been heard that it was in contemplation to re- commission them, but the Government of India expressed the hope that two really efficient war vessels might be substituted for these ships.29 (7) Orders affecting Royal Navy vessels in the Persian Gulf, 47. In telegrams dated the 1st October and 6th November 1888, the External a., March 1889, No. 151. Admiral, Kast India Station, had intimated ..... ... that the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Uult complied with requisitions^ but did not receive instructions from the Political Resident there. ^ The Admiral said that he could not accept a request made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf as coming from the Viceroy, and, further, that if three ships should be required in the Gulf, he (the Admiral) must consider the arrangement lately made, by which th0 number of Roval Navy vessels at the disposal of the Government of India had been reduced to four, to have failed. 48. In replying to the Admiral, the Government of India observed that the 4tb Article 01 the Last India Station Standing Order, dated the 25th April 1882, explained thst the subsidised vessels of the Royal Navy were to be employed in carrying out tiie requisitions of the Government of India, and clause 7 of the article very clearly directed that the commanders of the vessels In the Persian Gulf were to consider themselves at the, disposal of the British Resident^ or such other local authority as the Government of India might appoint. These directions had been repeated in paragraph 4 of the report of the Committee recently appointed to consider the question of the subsidy to be paid by the Indian Government for the Royal Navy vessels placed at its disposal by the Admiralty. 49. Although It had been arranged that the four subsidized vessels would ordinarily he stationed, one in the Bay of Bengal, one at Aden, one in the Persian Gulf, and one at Bombay ready for service in the Gulf, yet the Governor-General in Council considered that this implied that the vessels might occasionally be all employed in any particular way which the Government of India might deem proper. It was therefore pointed out that the demand for a third vessel for temporary service in the Gulf, should she be required there, did not affect the arrangement lately made for reducing the number of subsidised Royal Navy vessels to four, or infringe any of the conditions attached to the arrangement. (vi) British vessels of war in Basrah waters, 1883. 50. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had telegraphed to the Turkish Secret e ., September 1883. Nos. 172-178. Ambassador in London on the 7th March 1003 saying that the Governor-General of Baghdad had Informed him that a British man-of-war named England had arrived at Basra on the 26th February, and he desired to know the reason for the presence of the ship in Basra waters. It was afterwards reported that the ship which the Turkish authorities complained about being In Basra waters was H. M. S. Eclipse^ which the Admiralty supposed had visited Basra like other vessels of war at the instance of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. Earl Granville informed the Turkish Ambassador of the matter and observed that 11 In deference to the wishes of the Sublime Porte, British ships of war do * As to our vessels going as far a? Kurnah, see not proceed further up the Shat-el-Arab Turkish Arabia Precis, 1801— igos, Chapter xiv than Kurnah* but Her Majesty's Govern- (,l) atld ( ' l) ' ment are not aware of any regulation pre cluding such ships from visiting Basra.' (vii) Visit of H. M. S. 'Sphinx ' to Muhammerah in June 1889. 51. Certain false representations having been made at Tehran regarding the External a., September 1889, Nos. 147-149. ^ t0 ^'^ammerah, the Charge d Affaires had communicated to Amin-ul-Mulk the contents of a telegram received from Colonel Ross saying that the Sphinx had returned to Bushire on the 13th and that she visited Muhammerah to convey His Excellency's and Saad-ul-Mulk's instructions and stayed there only a few hours. It was also pointed out to the Amin that the Persian Foreign Office Agent when he hauled down the British flag from a British steamer, and was preparing to seize another British steamer, never reported 1288FD30 his proceedings to Tehran ; but he lost no time in sending false information about the British Resident at Bushire, and the British despatch-boat Sphinx, when they were only assisting in carrying out the Amir's own orders, and in preventing a very serious question assuming still more serious dimensions. Colonel Ross would have been perfectly justified in sending the Sphinx to replace the British flag on the Iran by force, and in protecting the Blosse Lynch from seizure ; that he did not do so had been an additional proof of his courteous and conciliatory nature, and of his friendl3 r feeling towards Persia. It was suggested to the Amin, in a private and unofficial way, that it might be well perhaps to replace the Foreign Office Agent at Muhammerah by a more intelligent, conciliatory and straightforward functionary. (viii) Communications between naval officers and naval chiefs or officials. Opera tions on land by naval officers to suppress the trade, slaves, 1898-99. 52, In June 1898 Commander Baker of H. M. S. Sphinx observed a Secret e ., November 1898. Nos. 560-600 (Nos. native vessel which he suspected of being 594-S97)- engaged in slave traffic, close in shore, abreast of the village of Sinna, in the territory of the Sultan of Maskat. Endea vours were made to overhaul the vessel, but the crew succeeded in effecting a landing before the Sphinx could reach her. Commander Baker then sent away two boats, one fully armed to intercept the fugitives on land and to prevent their escape, the other with side arms to deliver a message from Commander Baker to the Sheikh of Sinna. The Sheikh came out surrounded by followers armed with Martini-Henry rifles, swords and spears, and a collision was only avoided by the bold front shown by the officers in command of the landing parties. 53. Ultimately Lieutenant Robinson landed unarmed with the interpreter under the protection of the cutter and a landing party lying off _ the beach in a boat, and interviewed the headman, with the result that the fugitive crew of the badan were handed over to Commander Baker. On examination they proved mostly to be Arabs and were allowed to resume possession of their vessel. S3*A. The Sultan of t Maskat complained of these proceedings to Major Fagan, „ „ and as they were considered irregular, ecret ., March 1 gg, os. 247-254. ]yj a j es ^y» s Government, on the recom- mendation of the Indian Government, directed that, save in exceptional circum stances, all intercourse between naval officers and native chiefs or officials at Maskat and in the Persian Gulf should be conducted through the medium or with the knowledge of the Political Officers. 53-B. Stress was also laid on the rule already recognised, that in the absence of exceptional circumstances naval officers should undertake no active measures on land without the previous approval of the responsible political officers, and that naval officers are responsible to the superior political com manders for the exercise of the discretion left to thena (Secretary of State's despatch No. 43, Secret, dated 16th December 1898),(20 3i CHAPTER VII. Bushire Residency Steamers. The Hugh Rose. The Sphinx commissioned for the Persian Gulf. The R.I.M. Lawrence especially built for the Residency. 54. Up to October 1876 an Indian Government steamer was attached to 00 „ the Bushire Residency. In April 1874 Political A., June 1 8s1, Nos. 440-^49. v • i i \ n i application was made to replace the Hugh Rose, the last of the Residency steamers, by a vessel of a superior class. The only mention about its withdrawal that can be found in the records is contained in the Gulf Administration Report of the Persian Gulf for 1876-77, in paragraph 30 of which it is stated 'The Residency steamer was withdrawn in October 1876. A steam cutter has since been placed at the disposal of the Residency for quarantine duties in connection with the plague in Mesopotamia.' 55. In April 1877 Colonel Prideaux asked for a vessel to be sent to Bushire „ „ „ to be employed in quarantine duties. The General a., September 1877, Nos, 310.351. , r &gt; r y 1 n ;/„ Indian Government steamer Dalnousie was sent on 8th August 1877, the Dalhousie being required for the transport of troops, left Bushire for Bombay. 56. In January 1898 the Political Resident (Colonel Ross) represented the necessity for a special despatch vessel being attached to his Residency to save him being dependent on Royal Navy vessels when occasion required him to take trips by sea to places under his political control. He reported the request three years after, adding that— ' by substituting a suitable despatch vessel, not subject to withdrawal, for one of the three gun vessels told off for the Persian Gulf, it would in all respects be advantageous to the interests of Government as well as to the naval service. His representations were supported in the Government of India 's despatch to the Secretary of State of 27th May 1881, which proposed that the cost of the vessel (about ^25,000) should be met by the withdrawal from the Indian station of one of Her Majesty's gun-boats, a saving of about £ 5,000 a year being effected by the measure. 57 The Home Government asked for particulars as to the nature of the duties Political A,, Jane .88., Nos, 440-449. to be performed by the proposed despatch Political a., january 1882, Nos. 204 207. vessel and whether they would be strictly non-combatant; and in reply the Government of India, after having consulted Colonel Ross, explained what the vessel's duties would be and said that they would be strictly noil'combat ant. It was suggested, however, that she should carry small swivel guns for saluting purposes and one gun for signalling (despatch No. 3 Political, dated the 9th January 18S2). ^8. In reply the Government of India were told that His Majesty s Ship 3 ' Sphinx, especially constructed for service a., Political e., january 1884, Nos. 318-326. i n the Gulf, was about to be despatched there for the purpose. &lt;q The Government of India, however, in their despatch No, 15 Political, dated 29th January 1884, pointed out that the provision of an .mproved class of gun-boat for naval duties in the Gulf did not help Colonel Ross in what he wanted, thich was a purely non-combatant despatch vessel to be at h.s disposal when he had to move about the Gulf. 60. In a despatch from the Secretary of State His Lordship concurred in the opinion expressed by the Government of India that the gun-boat Sf/nn*, recently constructed for service in the Persian Gulf, did not render the provision of a desnatch vessel unnecessary. The Government of ndia were requested to prepare designs of the vessel required, when steps would be taken to construct the vessel in England. Plans for the new despatch vessel were duly prepared and approved by Colonel Ross.S 2 61. The R. I. M. S. Lawrence was the ship that came out of this project. It was, however, found to consume an enormous quantity of coal, a defect which is much in the way of its frequent use. (ii) Question cf arming the Lawrence* 62. The duties of the Indian Marine Service as defined in the Indian Marine Service Act of 1884 are —- The transport of troops, Guarding of convict settlements, Suppression of piracy. Survey of coasts and harbours, Visiting of light-houses, Relief of wrecked or distressed vessels, and other local objects. 63. This Act also empowers the Governor-General in Council to make laws for persons employed, or serving, in, or belonoing to, Her Majesty's Indian Marine Service, but such laws^ cannot be applied to any offence unless the vessel to which the offender belongs is at the time of the commission of the offence within Indian waters. The term 'Indian waters ' includes the high seas between the Cape of Good Hope on the west and the Straits of Magellan on the east. 64. The Act further provides that in case a state of war exists between Her Maiestv and any foreign power it shall be lawful for Her Majesty by proclamation or Order in Council to direct that any vessel belonging to Her Majesty's Indian Marine Service, and the men and oitcers from time to time serving thereon, shall be under the command of the 'Senior iSiaval Officer of the station where for the time being such ship may be* and that while any such vessel is under such command, such vessel shall be deemed, to all 'intents and purposes a vesse ol war of the Royal Navy, and the men and officers from time to time serv ing in such vessels shall be under such Naval Discipline Act or Acts as may be in force for the time being, and subject to such regulations as may be issued by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India in Council. .

This in his opinion was all that was necessary, and His Lordship then made the following important observations :—' It is not desirable to do anything which would induce the belief that the Indian Marine is a combatant force. It would indeed scarcely be acting in good faith to do so, since the Marine Regulation Act was passed on the understanding that the duties to be performed were mainly those of transport and communication. The armaments which should be ready on emergency, and v\ hen the vessels of the Marine came under the direct authority of the Naval Commander-in-Chief, shculd be kept in store in India, and be returned info store when no longer required under such authority. Shculd any fighting be necessary in ordinary times in the Persian Gulf, it must be done by Her Majestv's ships of war stationed there. It would be almost certain to produce complication, if the civil officer weie piactd in a position to make war, as it were, from his own yacht. On the other band, it will be advantageous that the vessels should be so constructed as 10 be capable of being useful in time of war. ' 68. 1 he Secretary of State's decision to keep the armaments in reserve was communi cated to those concerned, and the Government of India replied to His Lordship concurring • Paras. 62-75 taken fiom the Precis in Secret E., August 1896, hoi, 82- 85.33 in the decision that it was not neoessary to arm all the vessels of the Indian Marine but J° &amp; ofthe^srouldtve' evns o^Toard if 115 ' i S T e M„ i0 e p ro .

S P 73. The Secretary of State replied in his despatch No. 7 of 12th January 1893. He Pro. a .. June .893 No. 1306. said that there did not appear to him to be an v- or. ro, External A , March 1893, Nos. 170-182. thing in the Indian Marine Act of 1887 which warranted the arming of the Lawrence in the manner described. He admitted that this Act contained provisions for the punishment of misconduct in the presence of the enemy' which were inserted in case Indian Marine vessels should be employed in the suppression of piracy and other like services at times when, under section 6 of the Act of 1884, their crews would not be subject to the Naval Discipline Acts, but he added that 'the existence of these provisions cannot be held to warrant the arming of Indian Marine vessels without the sanction of Her Majesty's Government ' He further pointed out that in the case of the Lawrence it had been distinctly laid down that she should be strictly non-combatant ; that the reason why she was prepared and fitted for an armament was that in the event of war she might be available for service under the authority of the Naval Commander-in- Chief in the manner prescribed by the Act of 1884, and that instructions had been given that the armament until required in that manner should be kept in store in India. He also observed that the same course had been followed as regards the armament of the Warren Hastings, in regard to which the Admiralty had stated that they held ' a strong opinion that no sea-going armed vessel belonging to the State should be in commission unless she &gt;s under the control of the Admiralty.' 74- Finally, he observed that the foregoing as well as previous despatches show clearly ^at it has never been the intention of Her Majesty's Government that any of the Royal Indian Marine vessels should be used for fighting purposes otherwise than as provided for in the Act of 1884, that is to say, when a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any C1288FD]foreign power it shall be lawful for Her Majesty by proclamation, or Order in Council, to direct that any vessel belonging to the Indian Marine, and the officers and men from time to time serving thereon, shall be subject to the command of the Senior Naval Officer, and whilst under such command shall be regarded as belonging to the Royal Navy, In obedience to the above the Lawrence was disarmed. 75. In 1896 there were troubles at Bahrein in connection with which the Senior Naval Officer enquired whether he could use the Lawrence, but the decision was that he could not. 76. In 1903 Lord Curzon's Government represented to the Secretary of c . „ o . u m ^ State the advisability of seeking permis- oecret E., September 1903, Nos. oq - io . . . * 1 • i r sion from the Admiralty tor temporary commissioning, under a special flag for service in the Persian Gulf, for the sup pression of illicit traffic in arms of precision of the R. I. M. S. Lawrence. 77. The reply of the Secretary of State (No. 88-Mily., dated 26th June 1903) shows the objections to the course proposed :— After due consideration in Council of Your Excellency's Marine Despatch No. 7, ^ . dated oth October TQ02, in which vou repre- The proposea arming of the Rova! Indian Marine „ ,, i j • t •r- r j ■ „ • • „ r ™ Steamship ' Lawrence,' M. 59,37. sent the advisability of seeking permission from the Admiralty for the temporary commissioning, under a special flag, for service in the Persian Gulf, for the suppression of illicit traffic in arms of precision, of the Royal Indian Marine Steamship 'Lawrence,' I caused a reference on the subject to be made to the Admiralty. 2. The Lords Commissioners referred to the Solicitor to His Majestv's Treasury as to the legal aspects of the question. His opinion is, and the Lords Commissioners concur in his opinion that the course proposed by your Government can only be adopted in the event of a war with a foreign power, and that legislation on the lines of the Colonial Naval Defence Act of 1865 necessary in order to enable the vessels of the Royal Indian Marine to be placed at the disposal of the Admiralty 0 from time to time as occasion requires,' 3. Being desirous, however, if possible, of discovering a method of utilising the services of the ' Lawrence ' in the manner proposed, the Lord? Commissioners again referred to the Solicitor to the Treasury as to the extent of the power* conferred by the Indian Marine Service Act of 1884 as rogards the arming ol ver els of that service at times other than when a slate of war exists. In conference with the Legal Adviser of this Office the Solicitor to His Majer-ty's Treasury expressed the opinion that, provided nothing is done to militate against the well recognised undersLaiding that the Royal Indian Marine is a non-combatant service required mainly for transport and communica^ tions, there are no legal objections to the arming of a vessel of the establishment when considered necessary for the express purpose of penorming {he duties which come within the scope of the Act of 1884 ; that it is not necessary for the officer in command of the vessel to hold a commission from the Admiralty in order to enable him to be placed under the orders of the Senior Naval Officer in so far as regards the employment of his vessel upon those duties ; but that it is doubtful whether the prevention of smuggling is one of the duties contemplated by the Act, 4. Apart from the legal question, 1 do not consider that the necessity for legislation on the lines of the Colonial Naval Defence Act of 1865 has in the present case been shown. I am prepared to^agree with Your Excellency's Government that it ir desirable that our powers of patrol in the Persian Gulf should be increased, though no formal representation on the subject has yet been addressed to me, but I am not satisfied that the best means of attaining this object is by the employment of the ' Lawrence.' The occasions on which the Political Resident will require the use of a despatch-boat are likely to become more frequent, and it appears to me undesirable to take any steps which would tend to deprive that official of the exclusive claim to the service of the a Lawrence.' Conversely, it might well happen, should any scheme be sanctioned whereby the ' Lawrence ' could be placed under the orders of the Senior Nava 1 Officer, th^t at a time when the Naval Officer was counting on the co-operation of the ves el for police purposes, she might be urgently required for the use of the Political Redden.', 5. Moreover, the work o^ maritime police control is of a special character rer-uiring expert handling, Experierce ha^ shown th-t legal difficulty-are apt to arise in the case of a seizure of arms at sea, and theje diuicuhies m y develop into delicate international questions, should vessels flyin-y foreign fla^s be found to be implicated in the illicit traffic inarms. I doubt whether the officers o r the Royal Indi.n Marine should be called on to discharge duties involving so peculiar a responsibility without some previous course of special training, and, as at present advised, I am of opinion that the patrol of the Gulf for police purposes should continue to be entrusted to vessels of the Royal Navy under the exclusive control of the Naval Commander-in-Chief, 6. l am the more disposed to adhere to this decision owing to a recent proposal of the Admiralty to employ vessels of smaller draught in the Persian Gulf, which forms the subject Ci a separate despatch. I anticipate that this course will considerably assist your Government in the employment of police patrols and that the illicit traffic in arms of pre cision will be effectually dealt with by ordinary recognised means.35 CHAPTER VIIL New arrangements for the employment of subsidized vessels for service in the Persian Gulf, 1895 to 1903. 78. In 1S95 there were some changes made in the arrangement for the See Motes in Secret E,, March 1905, Nos. 290. employment of subsidized vessels in the 2 93- _ ^ _ Gulf. A new agreement was arrived at with the Admiralty under which India pays an increased subsidy to the Admiralty towards the maintenance of a naval force in Indian waters (Secretary of State's A-, January 1896, Nos, 67-78, and B., February despatch No. 66, dated 26th June I 895 ; 1896, Nos. 263-264. (Marine Department.) India 0ffice dated ^ j une ,3^ and Admiralty letters, dated 30th July and 24th October 1895). The amount of the subsidy is ;£ 100,000 per annum, and was based on the cost of the following ships, mz ,— „ ,I ' ons • ''Marathon'* ... 2,950 tons'V ® Replaced in 1904 by ' Fox ' ... 4,360 «(Rri';k'+ 1 / t :: ^ 'pigeon^ ;;; vis ' r 605 ' Total tonnage of present subsidised ships = 8,430.

The subsidised ships are under the control of the Naval Commander-in- Chief, who is however required to comply with the wishes of the Government of India as to their employment, and they are not to be employed without the consent of the Government of India south of a line drawn from Cape Guardafui to Point de Galle, and thence south of the Nicobar Islands to Cape Salang.

In pursuance of the above, the Naval Commander-in-Chief made the following suggestions which he proposed should take effect from the ist October 1904 s — (a) that the a Sphinx1,130 tons; &lt;f Lapwing', 805 tons; and ' Redbreast 805 tons, be Total tonnage of these three ships =2,740, considered the subsidised ships instead of the 'Fox', 4,360 tons ; a Perseus2,135 tons; 41 Lapwing ', 805 tons ; and ' Sphinx ', 1,130 tons ; (b) that, except with the consent of the Government of India, these vessels be not employed south of a line drawn from Aden, south of Sokotra, to Bombay ; (c) that yearly, during the months of May to September, each of tne ^hree ships in turn be allowed to proceed to Colombo for a change, and to enable the men to be put through their musketry course.3 6 81-A. The views of the Government of India were expressed in the following despatch :— No. 8, dated Simla, the 3rd November 1904. From—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council, To—The R ight H on'ble S t, J ohn B rodrick, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. We have the honour to refer to paragraph 3 of your military despatch No, 91, ^ dated 'Proceedings U3 in Secret E., September 1903, 3 r( ^ J u 'y I 9 0 3'^ n ^' :i ^ c ^ ^ ' s stated tLat the Nos. 113-114. details of the arrangements for the employment of the vessels of the Royal Navy for which a contribution is paid by India, would be settled in conference by representatives of the India Office and Admiralty. 2, We have recently received a communication on the subject from the Naval Commander-in-Chief who proposes that:— (i) His Majesty's ships and Redbreast should, with effect from October 1st, 1904, be the ships for which the annual subsidy is paid instead of the Fox, Perseus, Lapwing Sphinx ; (ii) these vessels should not, without the consent of the Government of India, be employed south of an imaginary line from Aden passing south of Sokotra to Bombay; (iii) each ship in turn should be stationed at Colombo from May to September annually in order that the musketry course may be carried out, the European crew being sent to the naval camp at Diyatalawa. These prnposa's, which are now referred for your consideration, have been accepted by us subject to any decision that may be arrived at by you in communication with the Admiralty. 3. We would here explain that political requirements necessitate the presence of three vessels in the Persian Gulf. Of these, one is required at the head of the Gulf during the summer months to check piracy during the date season, a second on the pearling banks and in the shallow waters around Bahrein, and a third at the moulh of the Gulf between Maskat, Henjam and Bander Abbas. Under the proposals of the Naval Commander -in- Chief, by which one ship proceeds annually to Colombo, only two vessels will he available for these services. We would therefore suggest that, in addition to the three gunboats referred to above, a special light draught vessel should be provided to po'ice the pearl banks in the neighbourhood of Bahrein and to be available for service in the creeks and f Vide yont telegram of the 15th March 1904. ^ ^he Gulf, which, as shown in the recent t case of piracy in Khor Hindian, the existing gunboats are unable to enter. If such a vessel were ordinarily stationed at Bahrein, it would no longer be necessary to provide the special boat J proposed for the J correspondence ending with your Secret use of the Political Agent, and any difficulty Despatch No 33, dated ihe 5th August 1904. arising out of the employment of an armed ship not sailing under the King's Commission, would thus be avoided. The additional vessel which we now suggest could be manned by a native crew under charge of a petty officer and the Political Agent's military guard could be made available for shipment should occasion arise. At the request of His Majesty's Minister at Tehran we are now construct- S Secret E., February 1905, Nos. 1539 1545. ^ ve sea fc 0 ^ n &amp; steam § cutters for the use of 1£ « . 1 • i• 1 r ... . . e Belgian Customs Department in the Persian Gulf, an d this d .spl a y of maritime activny on the part of the Persian Government is an additional cause for rendering the presence of such a vessel as we have suggested Cj6SirclDi6* 4., We also consider that as none of the subsidised vessels can be spared for emplov- ment in the Gulf of Aden, the imaginary line referred to in paragraph 2 (ii) above should run from Dhofar, south of bokotra, to Bombay. 5. We wish to bring to your notice that the tonnage of the vessels for which the annual contribution will now be paid is reduced from 6,605 tors to 3,740 tons, and, as stated in paragraph 37 of our military despatch No. 141, dated rath September .go!, we trust that when the financial relations between the United Kingdom and India are reconsidered in 1906, the views expressed m paragraph 314 (3) of the report of the Royal M^esty^G^ywnment? nan 8 reservati0Q niay be taKen into conLeration by His37 CHAPTER IX. Movements of the British versus Foreign men-of-war, 1901-05. (i) Movements of His Majesty's ships in connection with Maskat. 83. In April 1901, when the French ships-of-war the and Secret E-, September .90., No S . .-27. v j= it . ed Maskat and Sur, and before His Majesty s Ship Cossack was ordered to Sur, grave inconvenience was experienced by the Political Agent at Maskat in consequence of his inability to obtain the services of a man-of-war to proceed to Sur. The Government of India therefore suggested to Rear-Admiral Bosan- quet that instructions might issue to the effect that commanders of His Majesty's ships, when passing up or down the Persian Gulf, should if requested by the Consul at Maskat, place their services at the disposal of that official if possible and provided that their sailing orders were not of an urgent nature, and also that the Consul at Maskat should be kept informed as far as possible of the move ments of the ships in the Gulf. 83. No special instructions were, however, issued to Commanding Officers of His Majesty's ships to place their services at the disposal of the Consul at Maskat when possible, and if so requested, but it was pointed out that in the printed Standing Orders issued for the guidance of the squadron in the East Indies Command, it was laid down that ' it will be the duty of all captains to pay prompt attention to every requisition from the Indian Govern ment, or their authorized agent,' and further that 'as difficulties requiring prompt action are apt to arise suddenly, the Commanders of His Majesty's ships on this division (Persian Gulf) are to consider themselves at the disposal of the British Resident, or such other local authority as the Government of India may appoint, for the maintenance of the Maritime Police of these waters and for the support of British authority.' * These would appear to meet the wishes of the Government of India on the point. The senior officer in the Persian Gulf was directed to keep the Political Agent informed of the movements of ships on his division so far as it may be possible to forecast them. The Naval Commander in-Chief pointed out that if the Consul had lately been kept in ignorance of the whereabouts Secret E., January 1902, Nos. 9-is. and movements of vessels in the Gulf, it was due to the concentration of ships in the north of the division, and that when a vessel was stationed in the vicinity of Maskat, as is usually the case in normal times, her Commanding Officer was always very ready to assist the local Consular and Political authority in this or any other matter, (ii) Cruise of large men-of-war in the Persian Gulf, 1901-05. 1 ( a ) Cruise of the Highflyer&gt; igoi. 84. In recent years a great deal of importance has been attached by foreign nations competing with the British in the Persian Gulf to making a display! of the Afas^ Prem, 1892-1905. large men-of-war on its shores. However poorly off these nations might be at home in the number of such ships, their display is calculated to make a deep impression upon the natives, who know nothing of the naval strength of the several powers in Europe except what they see with their own eyes. Hence the British Government in order to counteract the impression produced by the visits of foreign cruiseis in the Gulf, have taken opportunities to despatch some of their large vessels to the Gulf, in addition to the vessels of the Indian Navy that are attached to the Persian Gulf squadron. 8^. In 1001 His Majesty's Ship Highflyer, with Rear-Admiral Bosanquet on board, made a cruise in the Gulf. The Secret e ., July 1901, Nos. 91-92. Rear-Admiral writing demi-officially on 20th April 1901 from Trincomali to Mr. W. R. Lawrence (late Private Secretary to His Excellency Lord Curzon) gave a short account of his crmse in the Persian Gulf on the Highflyer in company with the Sphinx. The Highflyer was the largest ship, with heaviest guns, that had visited the Gulf, &gt; and appears to have made a great impression on the people at the ports it visited, namely at Sur, Vide paragraphs J 8, I9i 3o and 28 above,38 Maskat, Bushire and Bandar Abbas. Admiral Bosanquet was struck with the paucity of the British influence in the Gulf: wherever one goes, whether from Sur north to Bushire or south again to Ormuz and Jask, there are splendid remains of Portuguese forts and houses, and yet their occupation is more than 200 years past. {b) Visit of the Russian cruiser Varyag and His Majesty 1 s Ship Amphitrite, igoi'igo2. 86. In December 1901 the Russian cruiser Varyag visited Maskat, Bandar _ _ A „ Abbas, Lineah, Bushire, Muhammerah, Secret E., August 1902, Nos. 1 -43. ^ , i rr v t £ Basrah and Koweit. It was one of the largest ships that had ever visited the Persian Gulf and, as it made as much display as possible, its sight and movements made a deep impression on the people. In order to counteract this impression, the Government of India, at the sugges tion of Colonel Kemball, after communicating with the India Office and the Admiral at Bombay, arranged that one of the large British men-of-war on her way to China should visit Maskat and the Gulf. His Majesty's Ship Amphitrite (Captain Windham), which sailed from England on 6th May 1902, was accord ingly ordered to call at Maskat and Bandar Abbas. It was a first class cruiser of 11,000 tons. 87. His Majesty's Ship Amphitrite ♦arrived at Maskat on 8th June 1902, after calling at Dhofar, Kuria Murria and Madruka on her way from Aden. After exchanging the usual formalities at Maskat, the cruiser showed its flag at Sur, again at Maskat, Seeb and Barka. It then visited Bahrein, Bushire, Koweit, the Pirate Coast, and Khor Fakan. Major Cox who, under orders of the Secretary of State, accompanied Captain Windham, concluded his report of the cruise (dated 28th June 1902) stating that His Majesty's ship in question had visited the Persian Gulf at a time when the climate was the cause of a good deal of distress to the ship's company, fresh as it was from a cold English spring; but that from a local point of view Government might rest assured that the Amphitrite' 1 s visit was productive of much good. Her Commander, Captain Windham, who thoroughly appreciated the object of his mission, laid himself out in every way, by hospitality to visitors, by throwing his ship open to sightseers and by the liberal exercise of the search light, to impress the natives and make his cruise effective. If the experiment could be repeated for a year during winter, it would, Major Cox suggested be an excellent measure. 88. The suggestion of Major Cox was communicated with approval by the Secret E., October . 9 o a , Ho.. 83-87. Secretary of State to the Admiralty, who promised to keep it in view as opportunity arose. Visit of the Russian cruiser Askold and His Majesty's Ships Renown and Fox, igo2-03. 89. In December 1902 the Russian first class cruiser Askold (6,000 tons) Secret e ., March 1903, Nos. 213-227. visited Maskat, Bandar Abbas, Lingah, Secret E., June 1903, Nos. 96-102. Bushire, Basrah and Koweit. The Govern ment thought that the cruise of a first class British battleship would be politically advantageous now, and so it was arranged that His Majesty's Ship Renown Should visit Maskat, Bushire, and Bandar Abbas, but not Koweit on account of the draught of water. It left Bombay for the Gulf on 25th January 1903. It called at Lingah, as well as Bandar Abbas, both of which ports are visited generally by French and Russian ships. The Naval Commander-in-Chief also directed, at the request of the Government of India, that His Majesty's ships passing up and down the Gulf during the cool season shall show the flag sit Lingah as well as at Bandar Abbas. {d) Cruise of His Excellency Lord Cur z on in the Gulf, 90. Lord Curzon's cruise on H. M. S. Hardinge accompanied by the squadron of H. M. ships Hyacinth^ Fox, Pomone and Argonaut answered well the purpose of counteracting the impression made by visits of foreign men-of-war in the Gulf. On account of this cruise is given in the Precis on Jnternaiional Rivalry and British Policy.39 CHAPTER X Salutes to be fired from His Majesty's ships to Native Chiefs and Political Officers in the Persian Gulf. 91. In October 1879 t ^ e Marine Department forwarded to the Foreign Department for consideration a latter from Political a , January ,880. No,. 306-402. t he Naval Commander-in-Chief on the sab- ject of the salutes from Her Majesty's ships in Indian waters, to which the officers in the diplomatic service of the Government of India were entitled, and the right of such officials to fly flags at sea, and what flag they should fly. 92. In the matter of salutes, the Marine Department was of opinion that the regulation laid down in the Secretary of State's despatches No. 135, dated 27th December 1877, and No. 12, dated 21st February 1878, and Foreign Department Notification No. 2-D. C. P, dated 1st January 1877, would meet all requirements. (The notification modified by the despatches fixed the royal salute, barring the actual presence of the Sovereign, at thirty-one guns.) oq . Reference was made by the Naval Commander-in-Chief to the practice obtaining' in the Persian Gulf of firing irregular salutes, and of political officers flying their flags on Her Majesty's ships. The Commander of H. M S. Daphne reported to the Commander-in-Chief that on visiting Basrah, he found that on a former occasion the Vice-Consul and Political Agent had been fluted with nine guns, and he therefore did the same. He also observed H. M. b. Arab leaving Maskat with the Officiating Political Agent on board, and iiymg a jack with a device in the centre. As these practices seemed to be irregular he asked for instructions as to the salutes the Political Agents in the Persian Gulf were entitled to, and on what -occasions, if any, they were permitted to hoist their jacks on board Her Majesty's ships. qa The Naval Commander-in-Chief, in forwarding this, said he only asked for information on these matters, in order that he nught beabletog.ve su^h instructions to the Commanding Officers of vessels m the Persian Gulf, as w.U ensure uniformity of procedure which did not at that time appear to e 1 , ck The Government of India requested the Resident, . Pe: ' s . ian Gu ^ an ^ Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, to report what was the practice hitherto adopted in regard to salutes and the flying of flags in the Persian Gulf. 96. The Resident replied, in his No. 385, dated 4th November 1879, as follows ni 4* When paying official visits to, embarking on board of, or disembarking from Her Majesty's vessels in course of duty, the Resident was saluted witli^hiifteen guns, and't JpolUical fgent, Mas^h eleven (as laid down in Government orders on the sublet of salute s ) wuhm the hmits jurisdiction, provided the ship was a saluting one, carrying more than guns.

There was no special authority for this practice, which rested on long usage, and was wholly dependent on the courtesy and consideration for the public interests of the Naval Com manders, who knew the advantage and convenience of the custom. The Resident thought that this was of greater practical importance to keep up than salutes, as it not only supported the political officers morally, but was useful in showing the inhabitants, the Agents, &amp;c., when they were in the neighbourhood, and notifying their tour all round the coast. 97. The new naval order of 1879* about salutes gave a list of certain salutes to be fired for particular Chiefs, and directed— ' These salutes (with the exception of that to the Sultan of Maskat) are to be fired by Her Majesty's ships, though they may have less than ten guns, but no other salute is to be fired by any oj Her Majesty's ships tn the Persian Gulf, carrying less than ten guns, ex cept at the express request 0} thi Political Resident' 98. With reference to this order Major Euan Smith recommended that all gun-boats should salute the Sultan of Maskat's flag once a year, as had always been done, as well as on first arrival at Maskat. In this suggestion Colonel Ross concurred, as the Sultan would feel hurt if the salute were not continued. 99. On the same subject Mr, Robertson observed ;— (1) That the Shaikh of Koweit was not included in the list, but he recom mended that he should be given five guns. (3) ;Haji Jabir Khan, Governor of Mohammerah, only got five guns, but he had always received nine. S S ' (3) As regards salutes generally, Mr. Robertson recommended that the power of requisitioning a salute should not be confined to the Resident alone, but should be extended to other political officers, who might request salutes up to nine guns when necessary. In this last suggestion Colonel Ross agreed, and recommended that the power of requisition should be extended to the Political Agent, Maskat, Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, and Assistant Political Agent, Basrah. * Table of salutes.

The Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, replied. No. 146, dated 6th December 1879, forwarding a letter from Mr. Robertson, much to the same pur port as that of Colonel Ross, that the salutes had practically been left much to the discretion of the commanders of vessels. Mr. Robertson thought it, politically, highly desirable that ships should both salute and fly the flags of political officers when on board in discharge of their duty; and in this opinion Colonel Miles concurred. 101. Colonel Ross having also sent his correspondence with the Senior Naval Officer about the new saluting orders to Colonel Miles, forwarded Colonel Miles' reply with his No. 392, dated nth November 1879. Colonel Miles con sidered that the practical abolition of the Sultan of Maskat's salute, without a special request on each occasion made by the Resident, would be undoubtedly detrimental to His Highness' prestige, and would lead the Arabs to think he was in disgrace. Besides this the Sultan would soon know that other Chiefs con tinued to get salutes, and this would cause a feeling of irritation which it would be desirable to avoid. He also thought that as there were occasions when salutes to political officers had a useful and beneficial effect, it would not be advisable that they should be abolished as they were practically so by the new order. 103. These reports were forwarded to the Naval Commander-in-Chief, and in his reply dated 4th April 1881, he stated Political a., July 1881, Nos. 176-178. that an attentive perusal of the corres pondence on the subject of firing salutes and carrying flags in the Persian Gulf led him to think that the difficulties which had arisen on the subject were caused rather by the caprice of the naval authorities than from any real necessity. The real causes of the objection made by the Admiralty to vessels of few guns firing salutes were shown by him to be the following: When the old small smooth-bore guns were superseded by rifled guns of large calibre, and where one gun took the place of twenty or tmrty of the o guns, the question of salutes became a serious one— 75/.—Because a ship with a few large guns could not fire a salute with safety to her men. W.— Because salutes were a cause of considerable detriment to rifled guns of precision. The Admiralty, therefore, opened the question with the Foreign Maritime Powers, and the consequence was an enormous international reduction in salutes, both on the occasions when required and the number o guns re &gt; ■ ■ that the old rule, of ships with few guns not saluting, was to be more strictly adhered to. This being now the established rule all over the world, the Naval Com mander-in-Chief saw no reason why it should be broken in the Persian Gu f, and he thought that, without any great detriment to the P^ 1 ic se''vice, sa u ing except under most extraordinary circumstances, might be abolished for the present. Meanwhile, and as it would perhaps be unwise to lay down a hard-and-fast rule that Her Majesty's vessels were not to salute at all, he ®'fg es / ed th Residents should be requested to be as chary as possible in asking for saluUs. io«. As regards the question of officials carrying a flag when embarked on board men-of-war, it appeared to the Naval Commander-in-Chief that the meaning of such an emblem was not understood. He observed that such a flag was rarely carried in European waters, and then only to ^' ot ® ^ es P e ' f e ° , d high position or great office of the personage on bo f d '' h ® s ' and ^ h orefence tr, Hpnnfp tlir- oresence of Royalty —the Admiralty flag to denote the presence of the Lords of the Admiralty ; while in the Persian Gulf every ^ flag of the Viceroy which, when seen afloat by a man -of-war, was entitled to a I288FD42 salute of thirty-one guns, and, next to the Royal standard, ordered to be treated with the highest marks of respect. There could, therefore, he thought, be no question that the Viceroy's flag should never be hoisted at sea, except to denote the presence of the Viceroy himself, and the use of any other flag by lesser officials was, he considered, as meaningless as if every Lieutenant in command of a gun-boat was to hoist an Admiral's flag whenever he was sent on a mission. 104. The Government of India (Military Department) replied as follows No. 561-S., dated Simla, the 23rd June 1881. From—The Secretary to the Government of India, Military (Marine) Department, To—His E xcellency R ear- A dmiral W. G orb J ones, C.B., Commander, Her Majesty's Naval Forces, East India Station. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's letter, dated the 4th April 1881, and to state that the tvvo questions of requiring Her Majesty's ships in the Persian Gulf to fire salutes in the case of the Political Officers and native Chiefs of the Gulf, and to carry flags when the former are on board, have been very carefully reconsidered by the Government of India, and that the Governor-General in Council, while concurring in Your Excellency's opinion that, under the circumstances explained in your letter, these salutes may be discontinued, does not desire to make any change in the practice of allowing the political representatives of this Government to hoist their flag in the manner prescribed. It is considered important that the presence of officers of Government in positions of responsibility and power, such as the Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, the Political Agent at Maskat and other Political Officers, who have hitherto been entitled to display a flag when afloat, should be made generally known at the places visited by some mark of distinction, and the Government of India anticipate no difficulty or misapprehension as regards the flying of the distinguishing flag, in view of the instructions contained in the Notification* of the • Home Department No. 1008. ^ j une l88o 105. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty informed the India Office L 0 „ ^ that they saw no objection to the arrange- Political A., November 1881, Nos. 96-97. . J -i • &lt;&lt; . u 1. .1. r • r ment proposed, vtz., that the firing ot salutes shall be discontinued, but that the existing regulation as to the hoisting of the Governor-General's flag by the Government officers in position of resp onsibility shall remain in force' (letter dated 16th September 1881). 106. The above orders were at first taken as applying to all classes of salutes. „ i_ 00 m « But the discontinuance of salutes was Political A,, March 1882, Nos. 018-320. , , r t .1 t- • 1 • r very keenly felt by the irucial Chiefs. The matter was brought to the notice of Government by Colonel Ross, and it was pointed out by him that apparently the objections as to firing salutes did not apply where the number of salutes to be fired was not more than five which could not cause much injury or inconvenience. The Commander-in-Chief thereupon passed orders that salutes should be continued to the Trucial Chiefs as hitherto. 107. In 1896 Captain Saddler was asked by Captain Baker of the Secret B. t August 18^6, Nos. 79-81. t wh , eth f n he should fire a Salute to the bultan s nag on arrival at Maskat. It was a non-saluting ship like the Lapwing and Pigeon. Captain Saddler thought that they should fire a salute once a year as the Cossack and Brisk did: the Arabs did not understand the distinction between a saluting and non-saluting vessel and mis-interpreted any omission to salute. 108.

Ottavi, then French Vice-Consul at Maskat, asked the Political Agent at Maskat whether in the event of his paying an official visit to H. M. S. Cossack, he would receive the salute he rece.ved from the Sultan of ind from vessels of his own Government, rtz.^ 9 guns. Ihe matter wa referred for the orders of the Resident and he informed the Pol.t.cal Agent that n view of the fact that French vessels had given him (the Resident) a salute of i ' i guns which he as a Resident of the Government of India is entitled to receive from vessels of Her Majesty's Navy, he was of opinion that the same courtes should be extended to ihe 'representative of the French republic m Maskat Under the circumstances the request of M. Ottavi for a salute of 9 guns w complied with.1 \ 45 114. When M. Ottavi was raised to the position of a Consul he demanded from the Sultan the same salute as the British representative, that is 11 guns, a demand which was complied with by His Highness. 115. In 1900 M. Ottavi refused to return the official visit of the Com mander of the Cossack, because the latter was unable to accord him the n gun- salute which he claimed. The Commander's action was fully supported by the Naval Commander-in-Chief. M. Ottavi seems to have referred the matter to the French Government, but what action was taken by them it is not known. No further claim was made by M. Ottavi for the 1 i-gun salute. 116. M. Laronce, who succeeded M. Ottavi, ranked as Vice-Consul, but received salutes of 9 guns from French men-of-war. One of the American men- of-war fired the 1 i-gun salute to the American Vice-Consul, and acting Consul Mr. Mackirdy, while another American man-of-war accorded him the salute of 7 guns. 117. Major Cox thought that the salute of n guns accorded to the British , , T M . Political Agent was a source of ernbarrass- External A., January 1903, Nos. 25-20, l /-. i • ment to the Consular representatives of other countries. He therefore proposed that either he should be authorized to inform foreign men-of-war that his salute was only 7 guns, while still receiving the 11 guns salute from British men-of-war, provided the representatives of other powers agreed to accept from British vessels purely their Consular salutes, or that the French or American Governments should be asked to state what salutes should be accorded to their representatives at Maskat. 118. The Government of India decided, however, not to take any action on these proposals. So long as our ships gave the French representative the salute fixed by the regulations, it matters little what practice the ships of other nations followed, while it would not be politic to abandon a salute of 11 guns which the latter accorded to our representative. It is just well that foreign men-of-war should recognize that our representative at Maskat is something more than a Consul, and so long as they continued to recognize this, the Government of India saw no adequate grounds for protest (Foreign Department letter No. 2476-E., dated 16th December ^902, with demi-official of 20th December 1902 to Major Cox).

Colonel Kemball was of opinion that for political reasons it was desirable that the practice, thus fortuitously instituted, should be continued. The Government of India agreed with the Resident. There appeared to be two alternative methods by which this could be efrected, namely:—(^) either to raise the rank of Vice-Consul to that of a Consul, or (0) to move the Admiralty to instruct the commanders of His Majesty s ships to continue the salute of the Vice-Consul, as a special arrangement, ihe Gov ernment of India asked for instructions of His Majesty s Government. 120. In the meanwhile they requested the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, to instruct Captain Windham of H M, S. Amphitme, when he \isited Bandar Abbas, to accord to His Majesty's representative the same samte as was given by the Pomone. 121.

Steam-launches for Political Officers. (i) Steam-launch for the Resident on the Persian Gulf. 122. In July 1876 a steam-launch was placed'at the disposal of the Resident in the Gulf for quarantine purposes. This General A.. September 1877, Nos. . u 1. i.u was only a temporary measure, but the Resident continued somehow to keep it until 1882, when he asked for a new one, VY more suited to the place. The necessity A,, Political E., June 1883, Nos. 133-I4I. , , i u i. D u* for a good steam-launch at Bushire was unquestionable. The Resident had to pay official visits on board Her Majesty's vessels visiting the Persian Gulf and as these vessels had to anchor several miles from the shore, a safe sea-boat was absolutely necessary. 123. The Government of India accordingly asked the Secretary of State to authorize Messrs. While &amp; Co., of Covves, to construct a life-boat pinnace, 37 or 38 feet in length, of the description supplied by them to the Admiralty and cause it to be despatched either direct to the Persian Gulf on board the vessel then preparing for the Gulf or to Bombay in one of Her Majesty's ships (despatch No. 17, dated 7th May 1883). &lt;A 0 ^ .

But as the Govern ment of India thought that the necessity for maintaining a steam-boat at Basrah had not been proved, they decided to sell the old boat at Bushire. &lt; 125. The boat obtained in 1884 was, on account of her deteriorated con- Extemai A., July 1903, Nos. 130-31. ditlon, replaced by a new one 1^1903, External a ., August 1903, No. i23v constructed at the Bombay dockyard at a cost of Rs. 24,000.

During Lord Curzon's tour in the Persian Gulf it was decided that it was necessary to provide the Consul at Muhammerah with a light draught launch suitable for touring on the Karun and Shat-el-Arab. Sir A. Hardinge brought the matter to the notice of the Marquess of Lansdowne. 128. The Secretary of State for India thereupon asked for an estimate Secret e. August 1904, Nos. 400-449 (No. 443)- the cost of providing a suitable vessel; Secret e., January 1905, Nos. 143-157). ^ but as the London Foreign Office suggested that It might be possible to hire one when required, Messrs. Lynch and Co., who had a steam-launch, were addressed on the subj'ect, but stated that they could not spare it for the purpose required. 129.

Mr. Cleinents Markham in i8yi (see (3) Low's History of the Indian Navy. synopsis in Chapter I above). I 33' The question was then being discussed as to continuing or revising the work done by the Indian Navy. The opinions of the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia and the Resident in the Persian Gulf were called for, through the Bombay Government, as to the necessity of further surveys in the waters &amp; of the Persian Gulf. Their reports are interesting as showing what they considered vas needed at the time, and as indicating the directions in which surveys may General A., March 1872, Nos. 18-20. liave y 6 ? t0 be ma de 3 and are therefore printed m extenso below :— No. 99, dated Bagdad, 10th November 1871. From— L ieutenant -C olonel c. H erbert , Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay in the Political Department. With reference to Government Resolution No. 4606, dated 27th September, which reached me on the 25th ultimo, I have the honor to report that, having no official connec tion with the Persian Gulf, 1 am not in a position to offer an opinion as to the necessity of further surveys thereof further than to state that, so far as the trade of this country is concerned, no complaints have ever reached me from the commanders of vessels as to 'the insufficiency of the existing charts, nor during three years I have resided in Turkish Arabia have I heard of any accident to any vessel in consequence of such. So far as I am informed the charts in use are considered excellent, the landmarks and soundings being clearly and accurately laid down. As regards this country itself, which from its historical associations its capabilitips with reference to agricultural and commercial enterprise, and its geographical position is of the greatest importance, there can, I think, be no doubt that it would be very desirable to complete the survey. The map now being compiled by Lieutenant Colhngwood will be drawn from surveys of the two great rivers, the Euphrates and Tigris, and the intervening country, but all the vast tracts of the province to the north and north-east, and that portion that lies between the 1 igris and the Louristan Range, have yet to be surveyed. 1 he task of undertaking this work would, I imagine, properly appertain to the Ottoman Government, but it is highly improbable that it will ever initiate such an undertaking, though possible it might be proposed to it by Her Majesty's Government with such offers of assistance in surveyors, etc., as might be deemed expedient. As regards the Shat-ul-Arab, I would not recommend that any special expense be at present incurred on a further survey, though, if that of the Persian Gult be undertaken the work might (with the consent of the States on either bank, Persia and Turkey) be extended to Busreh. It seems probable that, in the course of comparatively few years, Koweit may become the principal port of this country in the place of Busreh, I imagine that if it be decided to construct a railway to connect the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean, Koweit will be the position chosen for the terminus on the Gulf. But en th 'Ugh this be not so, it is not impossible that a navigable canal may be made from Busreh 10 the head of a large creek that runs inland from the harbour of Koweit to near Zobair, and this would complete the water communication between that harbour and the capital, Bagdad. The harbour 0J Koweit is said to be one of the finest in the world—to be easily entered, and very safe, while its climate is as salubrious as that of Busreh is unhealthy. I had a conversation on this subject some little time ago with His Excellency Midhut Pasha, and found him fully alive to the importance of the project which had already attracted his attenticn. ■'49 He U now proceeding to Busreh where it is probable he will remain some days, and will perhaps nnd time to make enquiries on the spot. If this be accomplished, a further survey of the Shat-ul-Arab will be wholly un necessary. J No. I3 0 i*3^7&gt; dated on board H. M.'s S. Hugh Rose, off Bahrein, 14th December 1871. From Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis Pelly, C.S.L, Her Britannic Majesty's Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, To— The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. 1 have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the Resolution of Government as per Jfo. 4606, dated 27th September 1871. margin, communicating to me a call from the Government of India for my opinion as to the necessity for further surveys in the waters of the Persian Gulf. 2. The question seems to me to be a nautical and professional one. Any opinion I may have arrived at on it will be accepted as that of a landsman, whose duties, however, have required his frequent cruising in most parts of the Gulf during a period of between nine aiid ten years. 3. The question further appears to me regardable from two points of view :— jst. —That of complete and scientific accuracy, and andly. —That of the practical requirements of navigation at the present time. 4. Regarded from the first point of view, a survey cannot, of course, be too accurate cr complete ; and there are doubtless some areas of water particularly on the Arabian side of the Gulf, which have not been completely surveyed, and where the navigation is more than ordinarily intricate. But these areas are away from the ordinary track of vessels, and I should not be prepared to advise further outlay on the survey in detail so long as other surveys of more immediately practical necessity remain uncompleted, and many of this latter character appear to be indicated in the abie and exhaustive despatch of Mr. Clement Markham, dated the 18th of February 1871. 5. Regarding the question from the second point of view, viz., that of the practical requirements of navigation at the present time, both observation and hearsay lead me to consider that the present surveys are sufficiently, and indeed remarkably, accurate in their soundings, delineation of coast lines, and cross-bearings. This opinion applies especially to the later charts revised by Commanoer C. G. Constable and Lieutenant A. W. Stiffe. ,-g) 6. At the same time there are a few points to which, if it be the intention of Govern- mert to establish a Marine Survey Department, I would, under correction, direct attention. And these points I will now briefly enumerate ;— is t, There is reported to be a sunken rock off Ras Noo at the entrance oi the Gwadur Bay, and on which one or more vessels have touched : the existence or position of this rock or shoal should. I think, be certainly determined as the governmental and mail steamers have constant need for passing close to it. 2ndly. Some navigators allege that certain shoal patches off the coast in the neigh- bourhood of Koh-Mobareck are not accurately laid down. I myself incline to doubt whether these allegations are well founded, but it might prove satisfactory to determine the point. w/y, I have heard it stated that there is a shoal paitch off the western end of the island of Larrack, and which is not laid down, but I am uncertain-as to whether this patch does or does not exist. 4 thly, The existence of two shoal patches marked on the chart on the starboard as vou enter the Angaum Sound from the eastward have, I believe, been questioned. I myself incline to think that these patches are accurately laid down, but as the Angium Sound is likely to be increasingly used, it would be advisable to dispose definitively of the question. rthly. It is reported that the Bassidore bank off the western end of the island of Kishm is silting up, and that soundings smaller than any marked on the chart have been struck on this bank. U seems probable that a mud bank situate like that of Bassidore would be liable to silt, and it might be well to revise the present soundings. 6tHv—The shoal known as the Pollior Shoal marked on the chart about mhW, between the island of Froor and Ras Boostanah should, I thmk, be resurveyed in detail, and a seoarate chart be made of it. The masters of native craft say they have no know ledge of this shoal. Some of our own navigators assert that the shoal has sufficient water on it for steamers of considerable draught to cross it. In my opinion the shoal mdubit 1288FDably exists^ but as it lies on the direct track of steamers calling at Lingah and passing thence up and down gulf, the determination of this shoal seems very desirable. It is also alleged that between the shoal and Ras Bo ostanah, there are one or more patches close inshore, which are not marked on the chart. This question might also be determined simultaneonsly with that of the Pollior Shoal. ythly —Some few years ago a merchant craft was burnt and sunken in the four and half fathom line a little to the southward of the entrance of the inner roads at Bushire. This wreck still lies in the fair-way channel of vessels passing to and fro the Busreh river from Bushire ; and it would be very convenient for commerce if the wreck were blown up or otherwise removed. Sthly.— There are the channels leading into the Shat-uI-A rah or Busreh River, and rather more to the westward another Khore or creek called Core Abdoollah, ixovn which, passing in a south-westerly direction, lies the tober^iSji Rei)ort No ' II90 ' 3 - ?9 ' dat2d '3^ 0c - harbour of Koweit. As already submitted in a previous report, I think that the question of a railway from the Mediterranean to the head of the Persian Gulf may sooner or later attract increased attention to the shore line thus summarized. And as Mr. W. Pai kes, Civil Engineer, has recently favoured me, after personal, though hurried, inspection of its localities, with his opinion on this shore line, I venture to subjoin his remarks as being of far more practical weight than any which I could pretend to offer: — ' We made a successful attempt to enter Koweit and an unsuccessful one to enter Core Abdoollah, 'The latter was provoking, but I do not think it is of much real consequence, because I am sure it would be impossible to' speak confidently of that place as a terminus for the railway without much more information than at present exists. The doubtful points are precisely those which require a systematic survey for their solution. 'The cause of our failure was this: Captain Avern and myself had quite understood that the pilot would take the ship up to the head of the Core, but when we had gone a short distance he got frightened and refused to go further. We had already found that the chart was useless as a guide. There is not a single fixed point visible from which we could determine our position. So all we could do was to come out again. ' Wi'l you allow me to suggest that it would be very desirable to have the positions of the buoys at the entrance to the Shat-el-Arab, and of the Telegraph Station at Fao, accurately determined by independent solar observation. The correctness of the chart would thus be tested, and if it was verified it would be really useful, which it is not at present c&lt; The head of Koweit Bay is undoubtedly suitable for a station for Indian Mail Steam ers, and the necessary accommodation could be afforded at no extravagant cost, but it is probable Core Abdoollah would answer still better, and it certainly deserves further exam ination. a The chart of Koveit is faulty. We distinctly saw a spit running nearly across the head of the Bay of which the chart gives no indication ; and in another part I found the depths decidedly less than shown on tho chart. The mode of showing the hills on shore is also misleading. They will offer no impediment to the railway approach as I had feared they might. The shore due north of the town of Kovveit will not do for the station as I had hoped. Proceeding southward from Koweit along the Arabian shore line, we come on a length of reefy, dirty ground, which appears to have been left partially unsurveyed. There is, I believe, a channel inshore of these reefs, and I am told tint a Turkish steamer of light draught recently * passed down the channel to Kateef, but this tract is so apart from our present ordinary lines of navigation that, as I observed before, I should not deem myself justified in advocating any immediate outlay on its survey. lothly. —A survey of the reefs on the shore lines of Kateef and Bahrein has already been ordered by Government, and the Turkish Commodore informs me it is his intention to organize a Turkish survey of the Ojair and Kateef shore line, and then to draft the officers of the survey into the ships of the squadron in view to providing every ship with a competent Turkish pilot, nth. —Passing round Ras Rekkan to the southward of Bahrein, we open a wide inden tation of coast between that Cape and the shore line known as the Pirate Coast. This indentation is sprinkled with frequent islets and reefs, in the survey of which great labour was, I believe, expended by the survey officers of the late Indian Navy. It is possible that the survey of this intricate indentation may not be complete, but I should not be prepared to recommend further outlay on it for the present, 7. In conclusion, when we consider the climate and intricacies of the Persian Gulf, and that the survey of it was executed with sailing vessels, and wholly without the aid of steam, it is, in my opinion, astonishing how accurate and in what detail the survey is found to be.5i 134. A survey of the shore lines, Katif and Bahrein, had already been ordered by the Government of India. Survey of the KatiJ and Bahrein Coasts, 1873-74, 135. In January 1873 the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, asked for n , » A T u q, m o instructions with regard to the proposed Political A., March 187J, Nos. 377-387, ^ T l .T survey of the Katir Reef channels by the Officer Commanding H. M.'s Schooner Constance. Colonel Herbart, Political Resident, Baghdad, was therefore asked to ascertain from the Pasha whether there were any objections to the proposed survey. The reply was that our Ambassador at Constantinople telegraphed to the effect that the Porte authorized the survey. The Pasha wished, however, that a Turkish corvette should accom pany H. M.'s schooner. Colonel Ross did not think this necessary, but the Government directed (till 24th March 1873) that the survey might proceed with or without a Turkish corvette, and that if a corvette wished to accompany the survey boat, no objection should be taken. 136. While the survey-boat was proceeding to make the survey, Colone^ „ K , Ross instructed its commander to communi- Poliucal A., May 1873, Nos. 193-205. , . , -r i • u 1 1 .u v cate to the lurkish local authorities at Katif the nature of his operations before landing to survey, and if any objection should be raised, to inform them that the operations were being undertaken with the cognizance of the Porte. The Government of India approved of these instructions (letter No. 985-P., dated 16th May 1873). 137. A complaint was then made by the Porte that the survey officers had 0 ... .ox- landed on the Neid coast. When enqui- Pohtical A., August 1873, Nos. 101-112. . . J . . ^ n . nes were made. Colonel Ross reported that neither the surveying vessel nor any of her boats had come within 5 miles of the Nejd coast, that the survey had till then been confined to channels of approach to Bahrein, and that no attempt had yet been made to survey the coast of Katif or Nejd (telegram of 31st July 1873). 138. Colonel Ross, however, represented that the survey party would r, f... , a o.u o m probably require to land on the Katif Political A., October 1873, Nos. 158-64. r .7 . .. . coast in order to measure base lines and erect temporary triangular posts, and in order to avoid any further misappre hension on the part of the local authorities at Nejd, he recommended that the commander of the survey vessel should be furnished by the Governor General of Turkish Arabia with explicit written permission to land. This request, the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, was desired to move the Ottoman Government to grant (letter No. 2a65-P., dated 23rd September 1873). 139. The Turkish Governor General, Irak, was pleased to comply with „ VT this request and directed Faiz Pasha Political A., January 1874, Nos. 11-15. „, , 1 . r i 1 r t?

Thereafter the Schooner Constance appears to have made the survey ^ „ XT * of the Katif coast unobstructed.
