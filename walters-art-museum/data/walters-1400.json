It was likely intended to be placed in their tomb. The hand of the second person is visible on the woman's upper arm. Part of the inscription on the back pillar is preserved and identifies the woman as a housewife, although her name is lost. The type of wig and the style of the face date the piece to the reign of King Amenhotep III (1390-1352 BC). It is also possible that the figure was produced in the late 19th or early 20th century as a forgery.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1913", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/27066", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1913, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "18th Dynasty (?)", "Reign": "Amenhotep III (1388-1348 BC) (?)", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.063", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.150_Fnt_BW.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.150_Fnt_BW.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.150_Fnt_BW.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.150_Fnt_BW.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.150_Fnt_BW.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL9_22.150_Fnt_BW.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Charles Street: Second Floor: Collector's Study"}
