His claims are against Shaikh Said bin Maktum the Ruler of Dubai [Shaikh Saʻīd bin Maktūm bin Hasher Āl Maktūm] and his brother Shaikh Man’a bin Rashid Al Maktum [Shaikh Mani bin Rashid Āl Maktūm], also Arab pearl merchant Salim bin Mussabbah bin Hamudah of Dubai, and the estate of Khan Bahadur Shaikh Isa bin Abdul Latif, the former Residency Agent at Sharjah, who died in September 1935. The correspondence consists mainly of the several petitions made by the plaintiff Viroomal Vallabdas, as well as letters in English and Arabic from Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan ‘Amad, the officiating Residency Agent at Sharjah, reporting his investigations to the Political Agent at Bahrain. There are English translations of a Tamask (credit note) from 1929 belonging to the defendant Salem bin Mussabbah bin Hamudah and an official record of the oral bankruptcy proceedings against him in 1931, before a Committee of Muslim citizens of Dubai and in the presence of his several creditors. In a letter to the Residency Agent, the defendant Shaikh Man’a bin Rashid Al Maktum refers to the settlement of similar debt recovery cases in Dubai, the current economic crisis and the losses suffered in the pearling industry.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Viroomal Vallabdas</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Debt recovery</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00025c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00025c#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00025c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
