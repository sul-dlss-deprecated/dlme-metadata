With regard to his allegation that he has found among the arms that he has taken from his alleged rebel subjects a certain number which he states bear the Bahrain V Government mark ■■■■ I suggest that I address a letter to His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain informing him of the alle gation of the Shaikh of Qatar and asking him if he can explain how this could have occurred. I feel that the answer that will be given by the Bahrain Government will probably be to the effect that the Shaikh of Qatar has been making war on the tribesmen of His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain and that the arms that they had in their possession would naturally bear the Bahrain Government stamp as they were given to them as Bahrain subjects well before there were hostilities between the Nairn and the Ruler of Qatar. 4/- — J-2- l b CD &gt; ^ 4. With regard to the second letter^ from the '——7^-— Ruler of Qatar dated the 17th July. I do not see any harm in our asking the Bahrain Government for their reasons for the re-imposition of the 5% duty and the prohibition against the landing of Qatar subjects in Bahrain, but I think it would be reasonable to inform the Ruler of Qatar that presumably the Bahrain Govern ment have taken these measures as they consider that the treatment of Bahrain subjects in^Qatar is not all that could be desired. We may point out to the Ruler of Qatar that the measures are of a temporary nature only and that presumably the Bahrain Government would oe disposed to withdraw them should they consider that the treatment of Bahrain subjects in Qatar no longer jus tifies such measures, 5. I am informed by the Adviser to the Bahrain Govern- ment that very few of the Nairn have actually crossed over to Bahrain but that a number of people from the smaller tribes such as the Bu Khwara have arrived and are appa rently living either on property previously owned by them or with friends and relatives in Muharraq and other parts of the Island, I believe that between 200 and 300 men, women and children have arrived, I have the honour to be.

I beg to refer to what I previuosly wrote to ^our Honour regarding the attitude of my insubordinate subjects and what was created by them from troubles and evil deeds and that was by the instigation of whoever encouraged them to persistence and disobedience by sending to them continuous supplies such as provisions, money, arras and ainmnition as I referred to it before and explained it to ^our Honour. What deceived my subjects all this time was my silence and not taking necessary measures against them, ifiey considered this my silence a relaxation and contempt on part so they increased their arrogance and aversion in all their actions. 1 tolerated all this period a thing which was incorrect for one like me to do so, thinking perhaps the matter will be settled in a satisfactory maimer. When the case was at end and no result was achieved, the only possibility left was to put right the question before it becomes serious. I hastened to take the \ actions necessary in such circumstances in order to put an end to what the rioters created of disturbances and troubles in any wgy 1 saw essential in the present state of affairs. When my said subjects felt my real determination in this matter they repented what they did and when 1 reached near them they came to me listners, obedient, submitting to my orders contenf|bible, yielding and surrendering themselves praying pardon and mercy for the offences committed by them towards me and the country. 1 could not do anything in this state, but bo accept their repentance and excuse, forgave them and pardoned their wrong deeds for which they were liable to punishment. i3ut I preferred forgiveness to punishment when they resigned to me obediently admitting their guilt and mistake. duly 1937) from Shaikh Abdullah bin ^asim Al ihani, C.i.ii., After Complimentsi did what was needlUl in such a case, returning each of them to his own abode and place after talcing the necessary precautions to ensure the non -recurrence of similar deeds and thanks be to the graces of Uod tranquility and peace were restored to all sides of the country. X have desired to inform you of this. Honourable. What regrets me to mention is the action of Bahrain during this period in providing my insubordinate subjects with provisions, money, arms and ammunition and to acting towards spreading the spirit of revolution and insubordination amongst my subjects. Jiven that I found among the arms possessed by the rebels of my subjects those registered with the registration mark of the Bahrain Government and my subjects alleged that they had been sent to them by the Bahrain Government, ihis confirms what i referred to before, i am sorry aonourable for the actions taken in Bahrain which i do not know on what grounds the Bahrain Government did so. Uuring the term of negotiations, the Bahrain Government prohibited in general goods and boats going to (^atar which may be expressed as estrangement in addition to the continuous provisions sent by them to my rebel suojects. 1 have communicated to you protesting against the detention of goods and their prohibition from entering ^tar and 1 do k W* know as yet the cause which led the Bahrain Government to adopt this course in spite of the friendship and the strong amity and brotherly relations existing between me and them, '-tfiey have adopted such a course that is m neither permissible nor correct to keep quiet about it. i am really astonished and embarrassed from this attitude as there is nothing between me and Bahrain which would necessitate this and i do not see the Bahrain have anything which may justify and permit this. 1 request ^o^r Honour therefore to take the necessary steps in connection with this estrangement which Bahrain has adopted against ^iatarand which is still going on, in addition to the interference which Bahrain made 'between me and my subjects without my knowing the reason which made the Bahrain Government to interfere in these matters which is contrary to friendship and the good continuous neighbourly relations which had existed between us in the past so that JL may be aware of and know about it. it is obvious that it is not permissible that the situation should remain in vagueness and ambiguity* 1 request ^our Jtionour to give what i mentioned your kind attention and let me have your reply about it so that 1 may know your views in these matters, ihis is what was necessary to explain to lour honour.

I have already sent you a letter dated 2nd Jamad al Awwal 1356 (llth July 1937) and explained to you what was necessary and hope that you will give it your kind attention so far as the present stated of affairs requie. Now I beg to inform Your Honour that I r^e^ived a letter dated 14th July 1937 equivalent to 5th Jamad al Awwal 1356 from the Political Agent, Bahrain, in forming me that His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain is fixing 5% on goods which arrive in Bahrain for tranship ment to Qatar instead of 2% which used to be recovered previously and now in force with regard to other sides. He has further informed me that His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain is prohibiting Qa^ar subjects from entering Bahrain. Your Honour , I regret for such an action for which I do not see any reason or justification. I cto not yet know the grounds on which the Bahrain Government have based the prohibition upon Qatar subjects from entering Bahrain , as this step adds to the difference and harms the friendship and good neighbourly relations which have been existing between both sides. I am now reporting my complaint and protest to you for this atti tude which the Bahrain Government have adopted towards me without any justification. I am certain and confidett that Your Honour will attach importance to this matter and take the necessary steps in this connection as Your Honour of the strong friendly relations existing between me and the High British Government which call for Your Honour f s attention in such matters. I shall be grateful to Your Honour if you will kindly let me have your1 -s- opinion on this matter and what action you are taking so that I may be well aware of your idea of such matters.

Ruler of Qatar to Captain T.Hickinbotham, Political Agen^ Bahrain. (o After Compliments. Referring to what I wrote to you in my letter dated 26th Rabi al Thani 1356 (5-7-37), I aastfended to take action and put an end to the disturbances and rest lessnesses created by the rioters of ray subjects who dis obeyed my orders. When I got near them and they felt my determination in taking measures against them, they repent ed their insubordination and yielded to me, listeners, obedient, contemptible, submissive to hqt orders and pray ing for pardon and mercy for the crimes and wrongs whih they committed towards me and the country and admitting their vuilt. I could not do anything, in these circum stances, but to pardon and forgive them for their faulty deeds for which they deserved punishment. But I preferred forgiveness rather than punishment when they yielded to me contemptible, confessing the wrongs and lapses. I did all necessary in such cases, scattering their concentra tion and making each of them return to his ovm place after I took the necessary precautions to stopping them from insubordination again. The tranquility and peace have been restored, thank be to God for his favours, to all parts of the country. But, Your Honour, I regret to mention the acts committed by Bahrain during this time, by reinforcing the rebels of my subjects by supplying them with provisions, money, arms and ammunition with the object of spreading the spirit of revolution and insub ordination amongst my subjects which is not admitted by laws and rules. I have found amongst the arms possessed by the rebels of my subjects, arms which bore the Bahrain Government mark. And my subjects alleged that they have been sent to them by the Bahrain Government. This is aproof to what I referred to before. Your Honour, I am sorry for the actions taken by the Bahrain Go vernment as I do not know on what grounds the Bahrain Government did so. As I wrote to you before, the Bahrain Government prohibited goods and boats from going to Qatar and did what may be expressed as es- trangement in addition to the continuous supplies sent to my subjects. I communicated to you my protest against this. The estrangement is still going on though I do not see that there is anything which may call for it. I have written to the Honourable the Political Resident about this matter communicating to him my protest because I want to know the reason for this attitude of the Bahrain Government towards me and the estran gement carried out in spite of the friendship existing between me and them. It is ob vious that it is not permissible that the situation should continue in this obscurity and vagueness and there•should remain no mistake in this matter because prohibition is a fact and there is no ambiguity and difficulty about it. And I do not know whether he Bahraing Government will continue this estrangement so that I may be are for my own worK. I should-be grateful and thankful to you if you would kindly let me have a clear and early reply about this.

I notice a tendency on the part of Bahrain, now that the Nairn have lost, to say that the Ruler of Qatar was assisted by hordes of bedouin from outside Qatar and I do not place much reliance in the statements. Probably there were nomads in arms on the Shaikh 1 s side just as the Nomadic Nairn were against him but I should estimate them at 600 at the most and I think this is a generous estimate.■ IIJ. ■ -- — Copy .

The prohibition imposed by the Bahrain Government on Qatar subjects seems to be occupying the attention of the Shaikh and all the people in Qatar and causing them a lot of anxiety. They consider this a very drastifi action taken against them by the Bahrain Government and that t hey claim they have not done anything deserving such a step. They get dates and other food supplies from Basrah and Kuwait and fruit from Qatif. The prices did not rise as there has been sufficient quantities of food stuff in Qatar when prohibition was imposed. 1 am given to understand that if the prohibition continues for two months more all the foreigners would leave ,ata. as they iind themselves somewhat isolated. Some of them have actually left already. The natives of Qatar were doing their best to show that the prohibition had not affected them ecomomically. -he effect will, however, be noted clearly after some time. There is only one British Indian subject in Doha. I have to state that I was well treated by the Shaikh and his officials who offered me all facilities. 6th August 1937. Sd.

The Nairn, in seventy boats arrived some days ago. Tomorrow the main body of them are being transferred from the south coast to a place just beyond the bridge at the end of the date gardens where they will live in their tents. I cannot get an idea of their numbers yet but I fancy there are over a thousand, others of them have settled in different parts of Bahrain where they have connections. His Highness is very happy about it - at present, myself I think they will probably become a nuisance sooner or later. Abdullah bin Qasim is reported to be very upset at losing them and all the inhabitants of northern Qatar as well. It is alv/ays regarded as f aib ! for people to leave one country for another. The Bahama are being very tiresome, holding meetings etc. etc. and His Highness is being very weak with them. However I don't anticipate any real trouble. ^ bdo There was a long article in an Egyptian Magazine about Zubara and our visit to Qatar, I was made out to be bad but the real villain of the piece was the B.G. and it was said that you provided Abdulla bin Qasim with rifles to injure j the Khalifah. The writer is someone here because many of the details, dates etc. etc. even about A-bdulla's letters to you, were quite correct. I will try and get a copy of the article but at present there is only one here and it is in demand.- 2.

It would have been silly to think for one moment that His Highness would contemplate asking us to refuse medical facilities for that is what it would have amounted to. I look on this as an opportunity for an effort to bring about a better understanding between Qatar and Bahrain. The present state of affairs is unfortunate and we must do all we can to improve the relations between the two states. 2# I am surprised at the numbers of the naim ^ho have come over.

BUSHir .E r^ -G'D 'NCY. ■ Date. CONFIDENTIAL F.ZCOP.DS /l 3^ With reference to your demi-official letter No. 656 dated the 27th August 1937, on further consideration I think you will find that in the correspondence referred to 'by you, that is, the correspondence which took place in 1875, there is no decision made by His Majesty's Government with regard to the ownership of Zubarah. In the letter from Lieutenant- Colonel E.C.Ross dated the 12th December 1874 he states that the Government of India have instructed him to inform Shaikh Esau bin Ali as follows 'If you should take any part in complications on the mainland the British Government will not guarantee you protection.' This does not amount to a decision regarding the ownership of Zubarah. Again in the letter of the 22nd February from Lieutenant-Colonel Ross to the Chief of Bahrain reference is made to the 'wishes' of the British Government which stated to be c ontained in the letter previously referred to C-H A *0 of the 12th; December 1874. Further in the letter there is an exhortation to the Shaikh to be guided by the 'advice' of the Government, but I can nowhere find a decision given re- garding the ownership of Zubarah. Again in the letter of the 31st March 1875 addressed to Shaikh Esau bin Ali the 'advice' of the Government of India is again referred to . The trend of the letter of the 31st May 1875 is to dissuade the Ruler of Bahrain from associating himself with affairs on the mainland/- Capta in A. C. Galloway, Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.d 1 o r -2- mainland as it was considered that interference might lead him into complications. There is no mention of any decision having been given nor is any decision given in that letter regarding the ownership of Zubarah. 2. From re-reading the letters it appears to me that the Government of India were at that time anxious to avoid complications on the mainlandsand at the same time they were not disposed to give a definite decision regarding the ownership of Zubarah, The same situation appears to have arisen this year. As I have said above I can find no specific decision by the Government of India, In fact they appear to have avoided giving a decision and although C'l v the Shaikh of Bahrain in his letter of the 9th Jamadi ul Awal stated that he was prepared to take the 'advice' of the Government of India and 'to abandon the affairs of Zubarah, and interference therein, completely', immediately afterwards he reserves his rights to Zubarah by stating 'not that our rights have become invalid or extinct', 3, If this decision had been clearly given in 1875 then I can see no reason why we should have taken so much trouble this year to settle this question when it had al ready been done. It would only have been necessary for us to have referred to the 1875 decision and refused to re open the question, I feel that I must have misread or overlooked the paragraph to which you refer when you infer that the 'decision' regarding the ownership of Zubarah is included in these letters, and I should be grateful if you would let me know to which paragraph of which letter you 1CONFIDENTIAL,.

MEMUKANDUM I enclose a copy oi a letter No.^44U/4obb' dated 6ra January 1945 which I have received rrom the Adviser to the Bahrain government. X, The tribesmen who came over to Bahrain in 1^57 must have regarded themselves as subjects ot trie Shaikh oi Bahrain or they would have remained in Qatar and submitted to the authority or tne ShaiKh of Qatar. Since these tribesmen reside in Bahrain and owe allegiance to the ShaiKh or Bahrain, I can see no objection to their being treated as Bahrain subjects. 5. I think it unnecessary and undesirable that these tribesmen should formalise their status by taking out Bahrain nationality papers; but I do not thinic the Shaikn ot Qato.r can have any grounds for objection if tribesmen who do not live in his territory and do not acknowledge his suzerainty are treated, as long as they are domiciled in Bahrain, as Bahrain subjects. 4. Will you Kindly let me know whether you approve of my replying to the Adviser that I agree to tne suggestion contained in the first sentence or paragraph b of his letter of 5rd January? A simple assent to his suggestion would not, I think, involve any jural implications.^ political Agent, Bahrain. a: it BUS' r - SIDENCY.' * *&gt;77 ' g OKFIO c KI.AL I'.-CC-OS I I (i A iyv^i Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His Highnoss Shaikh Salman desires ms to address you on the subject of the Arab tribesmen who came over from Matter to Bahrain during the quarrel which took place between the two States in 1937, 2, The Shaikhs of Bahrain have always regarded the Nairn, Bu Kawara, Cha'aban, Chibasi and Saada tribes and also some of the Musallam and Sulatah tribes as their subjects. In the old days when any danger threatened Bahrain the Shaikh used to summon these tribes to his side and they formed the bulk of the fighting forces of the Khalifah. These tribes still supply moat of the household servants and fidawis of the Ruling Family. In the past many of them settled permanently in Bahrain and are now living in Door, Jaww, Kedd and Muharraq, others remained in Qattar, where they acquired flocks and camels in some cases they took to living in villages but until the Qattar dispute they all visited Banrain freely and frequently. j h3. After tiio quarrel with Q.atar, whioh was partly caused by the Naiiu tribe claiming to be independent of the authority of the Shaikh of t^attar, the whole of the Nairn tribe and a number of families belonging to the other tribes crossed to Bahrain and settled in various parts of the islands. A few of them moved to Saudi Arabia, with the approval and permission of His Majesty King Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Bahrain because they wore able to find there better grazing for their flocks. The detachment of the Nairn tribe who are living on the mainland are financially supported by the Shaikh of Bahrain and they purchase their supplies from Bahrain# They are not subject to taxation in Saudi Arabia. The leaders of the tribes who came out of Qattar are in receipt of monthly payments from His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman on the same scale as were paid by his late father. While in Q,attar most of the men who regarded themselves as adherents of the Khalifah signed documents in which they stated that they were Bahrain subjects. 4. Since these Arabs came to Bahrain they have been officially regarded as foreigners, except those of them who happen to have been born here. If they have cases they appear in the Agency or Joint Courts and they are not at present eligible for employment by the Bahrain Petroleum Company as all permanent employees before they are taken on by the Company are required to produce a certificate of Bahrain nationality. 5. His Highness Shaikh Sir Salmn wishes the Arabs of those tribes which have come to Bahrain to be officially accepted as his subjects. Tie feels that his own retainers, who are paid by him in many cases and who wish to be his 3/- 3 - subjects should not have the status of foreigners, I am unable to give an accurate estimate of the number of people involved but I think soraethir^ in the neigh bourhood of a thousand parsons from Qattar are now living in Bahrain or on the mainland. 6. I would suggest that those who are now resident in Bai rain should be treated as Bahrain subjects as lon^: as they are in Bahrain. It would be possible to legalise tjeir position, were this thought necessary, by requiring each of them to take out Bahrain nationality papers, though ac cording to our practice we only allow this in case oi loreigners who own immoveable property within the State and the tribesmen own nothing. I should be glad to have your views on the subject or, if you wish, the matter could be discussed with His Highness but if the latter course is adopted I think probably His Highness would wish to reopen the whole question of the ^attar quarrel. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. [1 Advi aer to the Go vernmo nt. 'il m t | k . r No. C/238. Political Agency, Bahrain. Date d 21st Feb, 1 943.

Since his arrival here, Hickinbotham has been considering ways and means of settling this longstanding dispute and thinks that he can arrive at some agreement satisfactory to both sides on the lines of the neutral zones between Kuwait, Iraq and iiaudi Arabia. He tells me that the Kuwait neutral zone has worked ver^ smoothly and that the fact that there is no unified administration in it appears to worry nobody. 1 presume that neither His Majesty's Government nor the Government of India can raise any objection to tuch a solution and am asking him to pursue the matter on those lines. 3. With the drastic reduction in the cereal quota and the gradual exhaustion of old stocks of rice the ability of the Trucial Coast and ^.atar will be greatly diminished, but when one has rulers who are quite prepared to starve their own subjects to make a few rupees one cannot hope for complete security. 1 am sending a copy of this letter with its enclosure to Peel and Hickinbotham.

O (Jc &gt; ijovo- lr[ ^ ol. &lt;2. |«i- | ^ ' P. rvo• C| A \vNote on an interview with Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad al Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain, on the 9th December 1943. I went out to see His HigJ:/ness Shaikh Salman at Rifa'a on the afternoon of the 9th December. 1 had intended to raise with him the question of the decay of the Manama Baladiyyah and also the absence, ai ter so niany years, oi any properly trained judges in the Bahrain courts, as a corrective to the eulogies I had pronounced in my speech at his inves titure. 2. The conversation, however, took an entirely cuterent turn. After an exchange of compliments His highness took charge of it, and described his great anxiety regarding supplies and the way in which his personal honour as Ruler was affected by it. (Had he known that the Bahrain supplies were exhausted by the first of Decenber o^ing to the stupidity of the Middle Kast Supply Centre and the U.K.G.G., and that we had been living for the past ten days by broaching supplies intended for Saudi Arabia which we had been expressly 1or- bidden to use his anxiety would have been greater stilly. He then alluded to conditions on the crucial ^oast anc in Qatar and the fact that the&gt; have been able to maintain their re -export trade while Bahrain's had been greatly re duced. He had apparently recently had a visit from a well informed Qatari who had been describing conditions there anu mentioned that they were somehow able to export cereals ana sugar on a consioerable scale. He asked me why it was that Bahrain's quotas, had been i ixed so lov. aria Uiose tor the Trucial Coast so high, a fact which had causea him great loss. 1 replied that 1 could not say, as i had not been present at the time, whereupon he asked with consioerable vehemence why officers were sent to these parts who cid not know the country and who had to speak through a 'tarjuman .- 2 - I hastened to say that I recently approached the M.B.S.C. to have the quotas re-adjusted, and that we were reducing the Trucial Coast by 500 tons which was being re-allocated amongst Kuwait, Bahrain and liuscat. This somewhat molli fied him. 3. I thought the moment opportune to put in a useful word regarding ('atar, which has been a running sore for a long time, 1 said that if he would let me, I wished to discuss Qatar with him without, however, raising any question of Bahrain's rights in Zubara, regarding which 1 believe he felt strongly and of which 1 understooo his his uncle Shaikh Mohammed could talk for three hours without stopping. What I wished to gay was both in his interest ana in ours. I pointed out that it was correct that the Trucial Coast had taken a great deal of trade irom Bahrain in recent years but that it was not entirely cue to the war, and was partly due to the eiobargo on trade and travel to and from ^atar. I alluded to certain recent big pearl deals which Major Hickinbothaii. had mentioned to me, which formerly would certainly have taken place in Bahrain but had now gone to oatar and Dubai, and said that these tendencies were difficult to check, but that if he raised the embargo on atar there would be an immediate return ol ticiGe to Bahrain,and promised that their quota would ^immediately be reduced from that of the Trucial Coast and added to Bahrain. This would also help us as then we could control it much more successfully than we were now able to oo. 4, His highness then replied that the ! ;atar trade was only worth ten or twenty thousand rupees in customs dues -- and he flicked them away with his fingers as though they were crumbs —— and saic. that his lather hac. i requently j-iven away /-- 3 - away/more in presents to the al Thani SfciaikhB, who would frequently ask for this ana that and would never be denied but instantly fe;iven what they askea for. They were like brothers and the country v»as one country -- they made no distinction between the al Thani ana themselves. He then proceeded to make a very lengthy survey ol the /-ubara case and said that all Bahrain's foreign relations were in our hands and that they relied on us. when there was trie Per sian claim, his lather had entrusted its defence to us and we haa defended their rights, ana in every instance, except in that of Zubara we haa not fallen short. Wio coula they ? turn to except the British Government. i could not iollow all His Highness* arguments, as i had not the details ol this case at my fingers' ends, but he made it clear that they were much more disturbed by the loss o^ face than tn.e loss of property ana saia that he was certciin so Hie cirroinge- ment could be made and that he relied on us to m^ke it. ^ie finally produced a map ana pointing to the neutral zones between Kuwait and Iraq and Sauai Arabia conveyed that some thing on those lines could be arranged with Qatar too. I pointed out that if the Zubara question was re-opened the ^tar Shaikh would almost certainly re-open his claim to the Hawar Islands, anc that I thought it better to tell him frankly that 1 was afraid m^ views on this would probably not agree with his. He smiled at this ana spoke ioi some time about their claim whicn, 'the worla knew', was fully justifiea, but dia not press it. I repeated again that X doubted if we saw eye to eye on this subject. rvs 1 ndd been an hour and a half with him, I soon made excuse? and took my leave. 5. On my return 1 aiscussed the interview with the ioli- tical Agent, who pointed out that particular iiiterest attached£ t - 4 - to Kis HighneBB' suggestion of a neutral zone. Major Hickinbotham has been working quietly since his arrival to see if there is any possibility of settling this long standing cispute amicably, anc he had recently had an inter view with a vvell int ormed tatari who hac mace the suggestion the t it should be dead land anc he himself (Major Kickin- botham) thought he could get the al Thani family to aceept it. If this can be done it will be of enormous value as the present situation is in nobody's interest, and certainly no one in Bahrain wishes it to continue except possibly the Shaikh himself and his two uncles.. . to The He i»R«/8. l mi ■IB —4 &gt; I* r D.O.No.C/120. ) ) Politic nl --ency, a Bahrain, loth January, 1044. /icy loase Tefer to the enclosure t BUSHIRE RESIDENCY.

The Shaikh would like to be in control of the area in the event of any disorder occurring between the various tribesmen.. lie would not adjudicate between the parties but would send them, assuming them to be ^atar subjects or persons subject to that Shaikh' s jurisdir*t vor, to Bin Thani to be dealt with according to the law in force. He would naturally have full jurisdiction over his own tribesmen. The ground would not belong to him and he would have no rights therein which of course would mean that the oil a^reemen' v/ould not be affected by any solution of the Zubara problem on these lines. The whole thing is very nebulous and I now propose to / endeavour to get His Highness to be rather more definite ^.an He actually has been and to reduce his ideas to writing so that any further misunderstanding with regard to his exact Intentions 'dil be avoided. 5.

Kather i propose to inform you of the present position and very briefly how it has been reached. 3. As you are aware negotiations were started with the object of solving the Zubara problem by persuading the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Shaikh of Qatar to agree to the Zubara area being a 'neutral zone' on the lines of the 'neutral zone' bet ween Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The proposition appealed to the Shaikh of Bahrain but did not appeal to the Shaikh of Qatar who was not prepared to relinquish his sovereignty over any part of what he considered to be his dominions. i then tried a different line and made certain personal suggestions to the Shaikh of Bahrain which were that the actual buildings at Zubara might be considered as the personal property of the A1 Khalifah and also the ruins of the forts in the neghbour- hood while the territory should remain as a part of the Shaikh- dom of Qatar but the area in the immediate vicinity of Zubara should be open to all comers without let or hindrance. The Shaikh of Bahrain was to make it clear t |iat any agreement with The Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey prior, K.C.l.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gull, Bushire. /the | No.. 932 .-i. k : js100 2. the Shaikh of Qatar would not affect the asreement between Messrs. Petroleum Concessions tiimited and that Kul^r. ihe somewhat complicated question of adjudication in the Zubara area was to be solved by each party having jurisdiction over his own subjects and it was suggested that there might be a fixed annual quota for subjects of the State of Bahrain resident in Zubara who desired to import sugar, cloth, and cereals &amp;c., from Bahrain. Suffice it to say that these suggestions were only partly acceptable to both sides though 1 regret to say that much time was wasted before this became apparent. 4. Eventually after many more hours of wasted effort in endeavouring to reach a formula acceptable to both parties it occurred to me that the fewer conditions in any agreement that might bo drawn up the less likely there would be of trouble being caused by breaches of small and unimportant clauses. Therefore 1 suggested to the Shaikh of Bahrain that it should suffice if the Shaikh of Qatar would be prepared to acknowledge the personal family rights of the A1 Khalifah to their graveyard and their derelict and ruined buildings and should express a desire for a return to conditions as they were prior to the 1936 disturbances. x wrote to the Shaikh of Qatar on these lines but his reply was not encoura ging. So i decided to await the return from leave of Khan Bahadur Syed Abdur wazzak when x would make one last eifort to persuade him to be what i considered reasonable. At the end of last month the Khan Bahadur visited Qa^ar and after a stay of three days returned with the Shaikh of Qatar's acquiescence in the suggestion that it would suffice if they returned to the conditions as they were prior to the rupture; but unfortunately the Shaikh inserted a clause restricting or in fact forbidding the repairing of the present buildings or the construction of new buildings at Zubara or /Qa sr-ul-Muralr I ;1 I1 d 3. Qasr -ul-Murair. Full of hope Belgrave and J. tackled the Shaikh but he was suspicious of the ^o building 1 clause; and so a second draft was made and a further letter was sent with a private letter from Khan Bahadur Sjred Abdur Razzak to the Shaikh of Qatar's general factotum Saleh bin Manah. 1 have now received the Shaikh of Qatar*3 reply ? a copy of which i enclose. i have not yet had an opportunity of bringing it to the notice of the Shaikh of Bahrain but i propose to do so on the 16th of way and i will let you know his reactions at the first possible opportunity. if they are favourable then i will inform you officially of the position. if they are unsatisfactory then x will communi cate by mail and will probably suggest that we should advise Shaikh Salman officially to accept the Shaikh of Qatar's suggestions. 6. i should make it quite clear that from the beginning till now j . have been at pains to make it clear to both Kulers that at no time have 1 been acting officially. ± have used such personal influence as i possess to endeavouring to help them themselves to find a solution to a problem which has disturbed their peoples for the last seven years. The end of the 'Zubara Question' will be welcomed most heartily by everyone in both countries with the possible exceptions of the Shaikh of Bahrain and Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah the youngest son of the Shaikh of Qatar. i i- i - i r ? ■i(101 SECRST D.C.N® .C/774. 16th 'ay 1944 V\ *\ y 1, f^y, K ~' y Please refer to my demi-official letter wo•0/768 dated the 15th of May 1944. 2» Since writing my letter under reference I have had two hours discussion with His Highness and Belgrave on the latest proposal from Qatar. His Highness pointed out with some Justification that it differed materially from the draft which Khan Bahadur Abdur Razzak had brought back from Qatar. I am therefore writing to the Khan Bahadur and asking him for his comments. 3. The next move in this rather unexciting game must depend on Khan Bahadur Abdur Hazzak's reply but i think that 1 will make one last attempt to bring matters to a head by taking Abdur Razzak with me to Qatar as soon as Rogers arrives here and very possibly a representative of His Highness. If such a combination fails to reduce the Bin Thani citadel then i will confess myself defeated and other and better means will have to be resorted to if this silly squabble is to be termi nated. , The Hon'blc Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., ^ Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. |I left Bahrain for i^atar in the evening of the loth of June in the motor launch 'Ghazal' which was kindly lent to me by Messrs Petroleum Concessions Limited and arrived at Doha on the morning or the 16th of June. Information being sent to the Shaikh of Qatar at Riyan he immediately came in to joha and received me in the house of Abdullah bin Darwish one of the principal merchants of the place. The Shaikh of Qatar has a house of his own at joha ^ but it has not been inhabited for some years and it was for this reason that he made his temporary headquarters in a house belonging to a merchant. &lt; D 2. During my first interview with the Shaikh at about 10 a.m. on the 16th I discussed with him various outstandins problems, in particular the endeavours which were being made to re -establish friendly relations between Bahrain and Qatar, -lie question o^ the children of the manumitted slave Faraj bin Hadi, ana reoorts _ which had been received with regard to the smuggling ol cereals, sugar, and piecegoods, from Qatar to Persia. I found the ol-^iicn inclined to be cooperative and it was not long before the misunder standings which had occurred over the question of the chilaren o- Faraj bin Hadi had been cleared up. A separate communication hao been made to the Residency with regard to this case.as also has a separate communication been made with regard to the question Ox reducing the piecegoods, sugar, and cereal quotas for the Qatar peninsula. Our conversation on the subject of Zubarah moved on the usual lines with much protesting that the Shaikh himself was most anxious to restore relations and more protesting; that the asgressors have always been the A1 Khalifah. I showed the Shaikh a letter rhich I had received from the Shaikh of Bahrain making certain new sug-es tions for the solving of their various differences which was no better received than any of the previous ones had been. In fact It was not at all acceptable. We therefore deferred any further reference to this subject until later in the day when it was decided that I should go to Riyan, the Shaikh's headquarters,V • &gt; i before the time for the evening meal and we would then have a full and free discussion of this difficult subject. Shai'-ch Hamad the second son and the heir-presumptive was not v ;ell and was unable to be present at any of the interviews which I had with the Shaikh himself. Shaikh Hamad has had trouble with his teeth for some time past and I was C iven to understand that he was seriously ill and had been living on a milk diet for the last seven days. The Shaikh alluded to the unfortunate condition of his son and said that he would like him to come to Bahrain for treatment. I pointed out to the Shaikh that the most efficacious way of achieving his object would be for him, the Shaikh, to write a personal letter to the Shaikh of Bahrain who I felt would be likely to give^reasonable consideration and Shaikh Abdullah said that he would do so, but I am happy to be able to record that up .||| to the present no such communication has been made and Bahrain has been spared the difficulties of a visit in the immediate future of such a troublesome person as Shaikh Hamad. j +-v.o mattpT of an hour and a hair uhe After conversing for tne ma^er ux an Shaikh said that he would prefer to return to Riyan, the day being Friday, for his prayers and that he looked forward to seeing me later in the afternoon. 3. At the Shaikh 's request I lunched with Abdullah bin Darwish who is now the right-hand man arid co-partner with Shaikh Hamad in practically every underhand dealing of any magnitude which takes place in Qatar. He and his two brothers Jassim and Abdur Rahman are Qatar subjects by birth but are Persians by origin and all three of them have been gifted with more than average intelligence. Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Sazzaak who accompanied m e from Bahrain and Saleh bin Uana the confidant- and man -of- affairs of the Shaikh of ^atar were present at lunch. ^ter lunch I returned to the house of Saleh bin liana and-there discussed^, with him and Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak the w 3 ys and means of settling the Zubarah question - a question of which I,like many dozens of others,was heartily sick and my only desire was to either achieve a formula immediately agreeable to botn partxe. or to receive an answer sufficiently negative to make it cloar i \ JtLlj. 3 t to me that any further efforts on my part v/ere pure waste time. It was fortunate that Saleh hln Kana, who shou l - o stated is disliked by Shaikh Hamad,came out in quite a different way to what I had been led to expect and I found him most helpful during the vjhole of my visit. We decided that the only reason able chance of reaching a decision was to endeavour to rut the Shaikh of Q&amp;tar to approve a suggested agreement, a copy oi which I enclose, which had been drafted personally by Shaikh Salman and sent to i^atar about the 26th of April immediately after Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak's previous visit, felt that if by any chance the Shaikh of ^atar would be prepared to accept the draft as it stood the Shaikh of Bahrain would find some difficulty in refusing now to agree to what he himself had put forward only a few weeks before. Saleh bin Lana went imme diately to Riyan to discuss matters with the Shaikh anc. I'Jian Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and I retired to the launcn - or - brief rest. 4, At approximately 5-30 p.m. I left by car for Riyan accom panied by Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and Saleh bin liana. On arrival we were courteously received by the Shaikh and oonaucted at considerable physical discomfort to the old man himself to the roof of his palace where after coffee had been formally drunk .e proceeded to the business in hand. After much argument and the : addition by me of a clause safeguarding the interests of i'.essrs. Petroleum Concessions- Limited which I considered to be necessary the Shaikh of Qatar to my surprise agreed to Shaikh Salman's iraft without the alteration of one word. Paper was produced am Saleh bin Mana was instructed to make a record in writing fbr the fi approval of the Shaikh. While he was doing this the Shaikh ana I discussed various matters of minor importance with the exception of the recent smuggling incident on the southern frontier in the neighbourhood of Jehel Naksh which can never be described as being other than of major importance. I warned the shaikh ox Qatar as solemnly as I could that he should do everything in his power to prevent any such incidents occurring especially when members of his own family were involved, pointing out that J*T1 3 4 - 11 he knew as well as I did the fluid position with regard to his southern boundary and that it was indeed unwise to cive Saud the slightest excuse for making any advance in that direction such as the establishment of police posts to prevent smuggling. The Shaikh of «iatar said that he fully agreed with everything that I said and that he would do his utmost to prevent any recurrence of such incidents in the future. The copy was completed of the draft agreement and at that ■ moment the Shaikh stated quite correctly, for the call to prayer could be distinctly heard, that he wished to go and say the evening prayer. He left, but had gone scarcely two minutes when he sent for Saleh bin Mana. 5. The events now to be detailed did not come to light immediately but I have no doubt that they are correct. On Saleh bin liana leaving the audience room he was instructed by the Shaikh of Qatar to go to Shaikh Hamad, show him the proposed agreement, and instruct him to affix the Shaikh of Qatar's seal to the document. It is interesting to note that Shaikh Hamad ^ » should have succeeded in so far gaining control as to have the custody of that most precious of all the Arab emblems of sove reignty the signet ring. It appears that Saleh bin Mana went to Shaikh Hamad who read the document through, flew into a temper, it must be remembered he had severe tooth-ache and has had for some days previously, said that his father had sold the country to the Al Khalifah, that he would have no hand in such a proceeding and would not affix the seal. Saleh bin Liana having no alter native returned to the Shaikh of Qatar and told him what had occurred with the result that the old man was most upset, became querulous and tore the document into pieces which he cast from him. Saleh bin Liana returned to Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and myself and stated briefly what had occurred. Naturally we were both disgusted and disappointed and when the Shaikh returned whether immediately prior to the evening meal I asked him whsrs the docu ment had been completed. Pie became incoherent and it was with difficulty that we made out that he had decided that he must make various changes in the form and words of the agreement. I- ^ mm5. protested that he as the Shaikh ox Qatar had given his word, that it was impossible to do business when he changed his mmd every half an hour, and that as far as I was concerned J .he matter was ended. .Ve sat down to dinner, a dismal meal v :ith our host cursing the servants, his son Shaikh Ali behaving more like an elderly ewe than ever, Saleh bin Liana and Khan ^ah-dur i-&lt;- Abdur Razzaak not eating at all, and myself trying to think ox some way out of the impasse. No further mention was made that evening of the subject but I decided to spend the nit'ht in Saleh bin Mana^ house in Doha and to send + he launch round to at _ Zubarah to meet me there^about mid-day on the 17th June, i informed the Shaikh that I proposed to return via Zubarah and that I would call in the next day in the morning on my way to Zubarah in order to say goodbye. G. That evening I dealt with certain minor business recorded elsewhere and took coffee at the house of Hohammed A1 liana where I met one Marzook bin Shamlan a Kuwaiti who was undoubtedly in ^atar in connection with piecegoods. 'o mention was r.aue that ni;ht to Saleh bin Mana of the incident which had occurred at Riyan and silence was maintained the next mornine until he himself reopened the subject. We made it clear to him that ve haa no J intention of reopening the subject ourselves but in case the ohaikh y of ^atar had thought better of matters I was giving him a last opportunity by calling at Riyan on my way to Zubarah. a '' approxi mately half past eight on the morning of the 17th I loit lor Zubarah via Riyan. On our arrival at Riyan we were again most cordially received by the old Shaikh and alter the interchange of compliments appropriate to the occasion one of those secret whispered conversations which are always a feature of such dis cussions took place between Saleh bin Mana and our host the outcome &gt; of which was that our host turned to me and said that he wanted ^: speak about the Zubarah agreement. We started all over again am eventually he agreed to the formula of the eveninr before^rith an ^ exception and that exception was the deleting of the word This was moderately satisfactory although not as pleasant as had been the prospect of the night before, but I felt that the ioletion 'j of that particular word might be considered as advantageous to /the 4 16. the A1 Khalifah rather than the reverse and that it ..as possible that Shaikh Salman could be persuaded to accept. Once again the ceremony of copying was gone through, once again came the time for signature^and at the suggestion of Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak the Shaikh of ^atar signed the document in the presence of his son Ali, Saleh bin Lana, Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Hazzaak, and myself. He then said to Shaikh Ali 'Take this paper, show it to Hamad, and tell him to seal it'. Shaikh Ali took the paper and there was some swift thinking. I turned to the Shaikh and said ^ really unnecessary. Your Excellency has signed which is better than any seal'. There was an immediate chorus from Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and Saleh bin Kana of approval and Shaikh Ali stood in the doorway uncertain which way to go until to the relief of all of us the Shaikh of % atar saia 'It matters not' and the document passed into my keeping.

Sir, ZUBARA f VY ^ / i.U^ I have the honour to refer to my printed Istter No.c/l380 dated the 25th September 1944 and to enclose a cop^ of a letter dated the 3rd of October which I have received from His Highness the Shaikh on the subject of Zubara and my interim reply thereto. 2, On the 26th of September I called on His -ighness in con- necticn with matters of general interest and he a^ain raised the question of Zubara. He stated that his cousin Shaikh Khalifsh bin Mohammed had just returned from a visit to the mainland and found the guard at Zubara had been increased and that on his arrival at Zubara the Shaikh of Qatar's men came down to examine his launch. His Highness seemed much put out, and with cause, for an increase in the guard could certainly be construed as an infringement of the agreement. I indicated that Shaikh Khalifah must have been misinformed and His Highness sent for him at once so that I could confirm his statement. Unfortunately he had left the palace precincts. On my return to the Agency I desired Shaikh Khalifah to call upon me which he did at once. Far from confirming His Highness' words he denied ever having said that the guard had been increased. He stated that he informed His Highness that the guard appeared to consist of only four men though there were said to be twelve, and that he and his party were greeted with the greatest civility. The men who came down to the beach did so to enquire who they v/ere and having discovered they were from the Al Khalifah were very helpful and friendly. /OnOn two separate occasions His Hlgtmess has assured, me that he would 'be perfectly satisfied if the guard is withdrawn from the fort and that he would not raise the question of the destruction of the fort Itself. I understand that he made the same statement to the Adviser in the presence of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa. He has now,in his letter which forms an enclosure to this communication, specifically demanded the destruction, of the fort. I regret to say that in my opinion Kis Highness' vvord is not to be depended upon in matters concerning Zubara, on the subject of which his mental equilibrium seems to have been dis turbed. 3. However v/idely the agreement of the 23rd o-. June oe read there can be no cji estion but that the Shaikh of Bda rain is wrong in demanding the destruction of the fort at Zubara. request to have the g^iard removed is understandable lor no one t'j be continually under observation, but while it would oe a court eous gesture on the Shaikh of ^atar^s part to accede to the request his refusal to do so should surely not be considered sufficient grounds for an open breach between Bahrain and ^.atai . Why anyone should wish to visit Zubara I have no idea for the place is arid, unlovely in the extreme, and scarce one stone of the old buildings remains upon another. Those c^ the family who wish to hawk and the impecunious bedouin who fawn on anyone from whom there is the slightest hope of gain can ]a na at naif a hundred places on the Qatar coast without their eyes being offended by the sight of the guard at Zuhara or of the fort itself for that matter. 4. In my opinion there should be no question of a return to conditions as they were prior to the conclusion of the agreement. Trade would be adversely affected, our recently concluded arrangements for the conservation of shipping space by supplying ^atar through Bahrain would have to be reconsidered, and the already critical labour position here would not be Improved by refusing entry to labourers from Qatar. It is not as If public /opinion3. opinion was violently In favour of the upholding of the prestige of the M Ehalifah. The public are in favour of the present state of resumed friendly relations and care more for their own profit and convenience than for the honour of an unpopular Ruler and his parasitical family. The time has come when His rilgbness should be informed that far from trying to pick a fresh quarrel with Qatar he would be well advised to use his best endeavours to strengthen his relations with his neighbour for should an official decision ever be given on the Zubara question it would 'almost certainly be in favour of the Shaikh of Qatar. It may v/ell be that His Highness looks forward to a day when the Bin Than! family are forced from their present position by their oppressed subjects and the A1 Khal if ah are called upon to supply a new ruler for that unfortunate country. If this is so it is time His Higtiness was brought back to earth for though it is possible that the Bin Hianis may lose their power in Qatay, their present iniquities are certainly trying their aibj-^oU very high, there is no reason to suppose that the A1 Khalifah would ever be permitted to acquire territory on the mainland. E. I had addressed a letter, a copy of which forms an enclo sure to this letter, to the Shaikh of Qatar on the subject of the withdrawal of the guard from the Zubara fort which however has not yet been despatched, and I had found the time and oppor tunity to discuss the question with His Excellency's son Shaikh Hamad whose health has now much improved. I found Shaikh Hamad was not in favour of the guard being withdrawn though he could not put forward any convincing argument for Us Retention. Shaikh Hamad has assured me that he. will not enoeavour to influence his father one way or the other and there would thus be some hope of the Shaikh of Qatar agreeing without argument to the withdrawal of the guard. However, in view of His High ness' continued misstatements regarding what I had agreed to endeavour to do. I would jr efer not to have anything further to do with this matter and shall retain the letter here pending your instructions on the proposal made in the following ^para- ffraph.r j£ (// y ' •&gt;^7 4. 6, The agreement of the 22nd of December 1880 precludes His Hii^jhness from having any direct negotiations with any foreign State without th e consent of Kis Majesty T s Government, and it is presumably to this agreement that His Highness has referred in his letter of the 3rd October, Separate nego tiations were carried on with our consent in 1937 between representatives of the Shaikh of Qatar and the representatives of the Shaikh of Bahrain and I see no particular reason why we should now refuse to permit the two Rulers to endeavour to settle their own differences. I therefore suggest that we should accede to His Highness 1 request to negotiate directly with the Shaikh of Qatar on the understanding that I am kept fully informed of the course of the negotiations and consulted before any decision is made. At the same time I consider that His Highness should be informed that the Shaikh of Qatar does' not appear to have violated the -agreement of the 23rd of June, that a resumption of the blockade against Qatar cannot h e permitted, and that he would be well advised not to raise the qjestion at all since a rebuff may well be the likely outcome• 7 e in view of the attitude which His Hi^-^ness has adopted I consider it desirable that a final reply to his letter of 3rd October be sent as early as possible and I shall therefore be ^rateful if I may receive your instructions by telegram.'r. Translation of letter dated 16th Shauwal 1363 (3rd October 1944) from H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Bahrain. V/e regret to say that we find it absolutely necessary for the Zubarah question to be rewakened from its bed again. Sin^e months passed we have been thinking that it has been solved through you in a satisfantory way, when the discussions were started, we did not take the initiative, but only for the sake of your desire to solve the trouble for reasons ^•onner'ted with the food supplies for Qatar. The agreement was set whi^h v/e a^epted. The provisions of the agreement were set in the usual manner, but the important provision of this agreement was verbal. We therefore, in view of the conversations, find that the con dition of Zubarah is restored to its natural condition (i.e. as it was before the trouble). The important matter whi^h is making us grieved is the existence of the fort whirh was built by Shaikh Abdulia during the trouble and in whi^h he Kept an armed guard. This fort is overlooking Morair fort and is a few hundreds of yards far from it. If it has not been particularly mentioned in the agreement that Shaikh Abdulia should remove the fort and guard, we find it necessary for the condition to be restored as it was before and it is for him to remove this fort and guard, because as long as there is an Amir there (a name given by Abdulia to the person lending the guard) at Zubarah, it is not possible for any of our subjects to visit theBe places as it was in the past. You, in the discussions which took place, -onfirmed that you will do your influence for removal of the guard and the xort. We shall therefore fee grateful if you will fulfil what you have promised. But if you are unable to do that, we want Co khow i - l you have no objection to our taking up this question directly with Shaikh. Abdulia. in the past as you are aware in accordance with the treaty with the Great British Government we take up matters concerning us with him direct. As a result of tne agree- ment -on-iuded between us and Shaikh Abdullah we have be-ome a /la ughing-stocklaughing-stork in this Gulf, be-ausG it has become quite olear to everyone that Abdullah has made benefit from it, and we have benefitted nothing. Ve do not believe that you like to see us in a condition like this. We therefore, to satisfy your desire, suggest to you to again put this matter into discussions. You Wxl^ help to r emove this fort and guard from Zubarah to enable us to visit this pla^e without being subjected to the wat^h of ShaiKh Abdullah's guard at whinh time the world will clearly know that we have reached a satisfactory solution. But if Shaikh Abdullah insists for the existence of this fort and armed guard at Zubarah, we will prevent our subjects from making transactions or passage from Qatar and the condition will be restored as if it was before the ^on^lusion of this agreement.Q&amp;W) /Jo ^ooy of iottor dated '^nd October 1944 from the Political Agent, Balirain, to His Ex^ollen^y Shaikh Abdullah bin Qassim A1 Thani, '.l.E^, Ruler of Qatar. After compliments; Your Excellency will realize that i have been most anxious since i ^ame-to Bahrain to restore the old friendship which existed between Qatar and these islands. Due to the assistance which 1 have received from Your Sx-ellcn^y and from His Highness Shaikh Salrran there was concluded some few months ago a satisfactory agreement. The work is not yet completed and i look to Your Sxcellen^y for assistance in strengthening the ties between your country and Bahrain. 2. l have noticed that since Shaikh namad, your son, came to Bahrain His Highness Shaikh Salman has spared no effort to make plain to the general public by his personal conduct that the old ties of friendship between your country and yonr xamily and his country and his family have been resumed, i now suggest that it would be aporopriate on your part to indicate in some way that His Highness Shaikh Salman 1 s amiability has been appreciated. 3. Wear the ruined town of Zubarah Your Excellency some years ago constructed a fort and has maintained a garrison in it for the purpose, presumably, of watching the approaches to 2atar through Zubarah. 1 have little doubt that this winter His Highne^ Shaikh Salman and various members of his family will be desirous of visiting Zubarah and the surrounding country for the purpose of hawking. The presence of Your Excellency 's soldiers in the Zubarah area must be a little disturbing to tne sensibilities of the A1 Kholifah and i suggest to iour Sx^ellen^y that It would oe a very pleasant gesture and one vvhx^h would be mu'-h appre-iated by His Highness Shaikh iSalnan if Your Bx^ellon-y would agree to withdraw the men from the fort as a gesture of good-will to the A1 Khslifah family. it would probably be the best for Your Sx-ellen-y to write a letter to me indicating that it is your intention to withdraw the men from the fort at Subarah purely as an a-t of r*curtesy to the A1 Khalifah and an earnest of your wish to strengthen the ties between the two countries. Your 3x-elien-y can lose nothing by su^h an a^t and must ;^ain mn-h credit for your courtesy and kindliness.r v 4 COKFIDEMTIAL D.O.No.C/1425. 4th October 1944. r vv Please refer to my letter No.C/1424 dated 4th October. -• '' ' 2. I have little doubt that His Highness 1 letters of the 14th September and 3rd October will have caused you as much surprise as they did Belrrave and myself. The letter of the 3rd of October seems so strange after my letter of the 23rd September to His Highness that I think you should know how it came to be written. After receiving the first of these tters I made a verbal protest to His Highness who seemed surprised at my indig nation and declared that there was no question of my having 'promised' but only 'agreeing to endeavour' and that the letter must have been mistranslated. This was of course absurd, j . suggested that His Highness might like to alter the ]e tter to accord more with the facts and sent it to him the iolxo^-ng but it y ;as returned without amendment. Jassim bin Kohamed my most reliable interpreter-, whom I had entrusted with this misrion, complained that His Highness seemed to wilfully misunderstand his own language where Zubara was concerned. In view of Kis Highness' extraordinary attitude I felt that I had no option but to reply as I did in my letter of the 25rd September. 3 # As soon as was practicable His Highness discussed the whole affair at the usual distressing length with Belgrave soon after the latter»s return,and giving him his personal file asked him to examine the position on Friday the 29th ^September at Jidda to which place as you know Belgrave normally retreats on the weekly holiday. Belgrave did as he was requested and being well aware that His Highness had on more than one occasion declared that he would be satisfied by the removal of the guard drafted the original of the letter of October 3rd. This draft reviewed the position and su 00 ested intervention by myself for the removal of the guard /only The Hobble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Shiraz.£ only to be followed, should I be unsuccessful, by direct negotiation between the two Rulers in the hope that they would be more fortunate, and ending with a reference to the possibility of relations bein^; a^ain broken off. However, the Shaikh without further discussion with Belrrave and without even showing him the letter before despatch inserted his demand for the destruction of the fort into the original draft and made various other alt erations, thus turning what was a conciliatory and constructive le tter into one whose tone, viewgd in the light of the previous corres- % pondence, can only be described as offensive, Beln;rave is not unnaturally very upset but is too loyal to his master to £,ive free expression to his feelings, When I say that His Highness is deranged on the subject of Zubara Belgrave always replies 'His father was exactly the same'; that is the nearest he will go to agreeing to the mental instability of the Shaikh,% CONFIDENTIAL EXPRESS LETTER From - Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To - Political Agent, Bahrain.

Our mutual friend Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abaul-Razzaq has arrived here with a message from you which he has conveyed to me. I thank you for your kind sentiucnts but very much regret my inability to agree with what ho has said to me because the circunstances and things related to that do not enable me to agree to what he has said. At the same time I request your pardon and overlook that (matter). % Iv xt hi jw- ZiBjl V 1 'y QATAR (^LUdhuA^ In view of the fact that Express Letter No.c/374 S- us~ , dated the 18th October was not received by me until you had arrived in Bahrain on tour and His Highness had expressed a desire to discuss the Zubara question with you at an early opportunity I refrained from taking action in accordance with lj J paragraph 6 of my letter No*C/1424 dated the 4th October 1944. 2. On the 19th of October at the interview which you had with His Highness at Raffa, at which were present the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and myself, he spoke with considerable feeling on the subject of what he considered to be the Shaikh of Qatar's failure to implement the Bahrain--Qatar Agreement. He demanded the destruction of the Qatar fort at Zubara and. the withdrawal from Zubara of the Shaikh of Qatar 1 s guards. You refrained from stating any opinion at the time and informed His Highness that you proposed to let him have an answer at a later date. As a result of further discussions which we had on the subject it was decided that His Highness 1 demand for the destruction of the fort was unreasonable and not in accordance with the aforesaid agreement, whereas his request for the with drawal of the guards might be considered to be reasonable. In y order to ascertain what the Shaikh of Qatar's attitude would be to a request by us for the withdrawal of the guards it was deci ded that Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak, the Residency Agent at Sharjah, should go to Qatar and personally sound the Shaikh on this point. This was done and shortly after your return trom India the Khan Bahadur returned to Bahrain from Qatar with the x somewhat disconcerting news that the Shaikh of Qatar had refused point blank to agree to any suggestion that the guards should be withdrawn. 3. On my instructions Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur R a zzaak while in Qatar made confidential enquiries into certain allegations with regard to smuggling which have been received by me and on his return handed me a report which confirmed my suspicions that smuggling of plecegoods.was being carried on and that shaikh /Hamad —IS- uf 2. Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani was actively engaged not only in this practice but also in slave trading. It was decided that in view of the reports which had been received from various parts of the Gulf and of the report now furnished by Khan Bfchadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak, a trustworthy and skilful observer, that action would have to be taken to ensure that quota goods of all descriptions were not re-exported after their arrival in Qatar. A letter, a copy of which has been handed to your office under my printed letter No.C/1666 dated the ISth November 1944, was composed after consultation with you and despatched to the Shaikh of Qatar informing him of the action which it is proposed to take, that is, to appoint a Bahrain firm of standing to receifi all imports of quota goods and to depute a member of this Agency to introduce an adequate rationing scheme* 4. At the same time the Shaikh of Bahrain was informed that there would be no objection to his conducting direct negotiations with the Shaikh of Qatar with the object of obtaining the with drawal of the guards from the fort at Zubara provi^sd h.^ kspt me fully informed of the progress of the negotiations. 5. The aforementioned letter to the Shaikh of Qatar has been despatched and enquiries have been made from the firm of Dhaman- mal Isardas whether they will be willing to undertake the import ation of quota goods into Qatar. They have not yet given their decision but I anticipate that they will in fact be quite willing to assist us by undertaking the work and it is my intention to depute Jassim bin Mohammed who is at present on loan to the Public Relations Bureau to inaugurate a rationing scheme. The Shaikh of Qatar has been told that in view of his failure to wr-ry cooperate in preventing the misappropriation of quota goods it is not our intention to make provision for him and his imme diate relatives. We have also informed the Shaikh that we hope to be able to introduce this simple rationing scheme by the 15th of December. No attempt has been made to keep this matter secret. In fact the reverse has been the policy because the re-export from, • » 3. Qatar of quota goods of all descriptions has received very considerable publicity in the Gulf among the local Arabs and they are also aware of Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah's slaving and possibly arms traficking side-lines. It is therefore most desirable that the world of the Persian Gulf should be equally well informed of the measures which we propose to take to coun teract these practices. I am sure that the action which has been taken so far with regard to Qatar will have a very satis factory effect and will serve to make claar v to everyone that although we can be fooled for part of the time we cannot be fooled the whole time and that when we do take action we rightly do not indulge in half measures. 20-11 -4419/243 Political Agent, Bahrain.

Hicklnbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, BAHRAIN. To The Hon t ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE. ■ su, , r bushire re sidency. No ^ Date /.U'. CONOOENTIAL RECORDS Zubara I have the honour to refer to the enclosures to my printed Letter No. 0/1789 dated the 18th December 1944 and to state that His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad A1 Khalifah, K.C .I .E., called on me on December 20th to acquaint me with the conversations which had taken place between the bearer of his letter, Abdullah bin jabar, and the Shaikh of Qatar. 2. His Highness was obviously pleased with the reception which had been accorded to his envoy, for such in fact Abdullah bin Jabar was, and much appreciated the terras in which the Shaikh of Qatar had ref^ered to himself and in particular to His Highness 1 father. The envoy was treated with great consideration and it would seem was able to discuss very frankly the outstanding problem between the two States. I gather that His Highness authorised his envoy to discuss the Zubara question as a whole with particular reference to the destruction of the fort there or, alter natively, the withdrawal of the guards from the fort. He was also instructed to discuss the possible return by the Shaikh of Qatar of all the arms which were captured from the 'Nairn at the time of the Zubara disturbances in 1936. 3. Shaikh Abdullah, according to His Highness, took the line that as regards the Zubara area he was not hisown master for he was bound by the treaty negotiated by Sir Percy Cox in 1916. He stated that according to the treaty it was not possible for him, without the permission of His Majesty^ Government, to alienate any part of Qatar territory and therefore he could not acknowledge the A1 Khalifah's claim to Zubara. He is alleged however to have indicated to the envoy that he would personally have no # objection to acknowledging the rights of the A1 Khalifah to the Zubara area if His Majesty's Government would indicate that they would accord cheir consent to such a proceeding. The Shaikh of Qatar is stated to have described the Political agreements betv/een His Majesty*s Government and Qatar at considerable length to the envoy and laid some stress on Sir Percy Cox's letter dated the 3rd November 1916 by which we are precluded from appointing a political represencacive to Qatar without his consent. 4. With regard to the withdrawal of the guard- and the possible destruction of the fort I was unable to obtain any very clear indication from His Highness of whac che Shaikh of Qatar had actually stated but gathered he had indicated that it was^inatter which he was unable to decide without direction from us. His Highness staced that his envoy had * made it clear that che- Shaikh of Qatar was prepared to act on an unofficial indication of our pleasure with regard to both these two points and would not require an official request. At this state of the conversation I decided that it would as well be to acquaint His Highness ^he fact that I had already received a verbal offer from che Shaikh of Qatar to withdraw the guards which I had passe^ on to you and that on your instructions I had informed the shaikh's messenger that there would be no oojecoion to nis bulgestio^ and asked him to let me know for your information when the withdrawal had in fact taken place. 5. The last point which His Highness raised and which /is@^1 is of minor importance was to do with the return of the -fewsisis which had been captured at the time of the original hostilities. The shaikh of Qatar informed His Highness 1 representative that the arms were still in his possession and that they had been carefully preserved by him personally and that he was prepared to hand them over provided His Highness would make a definite written request for them. His Highness was inclined to seek our assistance in this matter but I pointed out to him that it was, a matter for the Shaikh of Qatar to decide and that persumably if he desired him to return the arms and felt that he could ask for them he would do so. He would thus be able to put to the test the Shaikh of Qatar^ good intentions. His Highness made no definite statement with regard to his intentions and I am inclined to believe that he will have the intelligence not to push zhe matter any further. 6. If the Shaikh of Bahrain f s envoy is to be believed the Shaikh of Qatar has undergone a very curious change of heart with regard to the Zubara question which can be explained in part by the fact that the real respect which the two Rilers have for each other has been revived by the re-establishemnt of relations between their countries, and in part, and I fear me the greater part, by the pressure which the Ruler of Qatar is at present being subjected to by us to improve the economic condition of his people. The existing agreement between the two countries restores the political position to what it was prior to the outbreak of hostilities in 1936 and is so worded as to obviate the necessity for a decision to be given with regard to the actual sovereignty of the Zubara area. If time could be allowed to pass I think the old relationship between Bahrain and Qatar would be completely re-established and the Zubara volcano would again return to .the quiescent stage, but only ■ . /- 4 - would this be so if the Shaikh of ^atar fulfils his intention of withdrawing the guards from the fore of Zubara. 7. I find His Highness' account of the discussions in Qatar rather too satisfactory to be fully credible and I doubt not that the Bin Thanis would have a very different story to tell. What in fact has happened is that His Highness 1 very non-committal letter met with the reply it deserved, bland, polite, and equally non-committal, and His Highness* verbal approaches have caused the Shaikh of Qatar to take refuge behind his treaty of 1916. His Highness 1 object in so fully acquainting me with what had taken place between Abdullah bin jabar and the Shaikh of Qatar was undoubtedly to indicate that he felt that pressure might be brought to bear by us on the Shaikh of Qatar to obtain a declaration from him to the effect that he acknowledged the Al Khalifah 's rights in the Zubara area. par from acquiescing in what almost amounts to a request by His Highness I consider that his attention should be drawn to the fact that he was permicted to enter into direct negotiations with the Shaikh of Qatar for the sole purpose of arranging for the removal of the guards from the fort at Zubara. I suggest therefore that I should now inform him that 1 have communicated to you the substance of our conversation on the 18th of December and have been instructed by you to express your interest in what has already taken place and your hope x that any future discussions will be confined to the specific question of the withdrawal of the guards from the Zubara fort. At the same time in order to ensure a continuance of the present reasonably good relations between the two countries I think that we should be well advised to do all chat is possible to have f # the aforesaid guards removed.

Shaikh is extremely worried about Zubara position owing to his desire to send his followers and flocks to graze in Qatar.

No. P 12, THE AGENCY BAHRAIN (Gamp) Shiraz, Dated the 23rd August, 1945. &gt;&gt;&gt; Like, I suppose, most Political Ae^its, Bahrain, I get a strong feeling of nausea when the nama/of Zubara is mentioned. I regret, therefore, to have /oO address you on the subject. The last official lector /o you on my file appears to have been Hickinbotham's despatch l.o. c/1916 dated the 20th December, 1944. The guards mentioned therein were withdrawn from the fort and, I believe, have not been replaced. I do not suppose that anyone imagined that that was the end of the case and that Bahrain and ^atar were then about 11 to live happily ever after', anyone did, disillusion was rapid and complete. fc J 13 xr I 2. Sheikh Salman cj^mehds tJiat (i) before the rupture in 1936, his subjects freely visited the land of atar (ii) as the agreement negotiated by Hiecinbocham in June, 1944, 'restored the status quo ante 1936 without, referring to 'any of the issues between the two houses^ (Hickinbotham' s despatch to you .;o. C/963 dateu PAzh June), Bahrain subjects should now freely visit j^at a 3. Sheikh Salman was not long ifi taking action to test the validity of his contentions. in ..'arch c. oiiis year he sent some of his people to graze cheir flocks in atar and when they were detained and harassed by the Sheikh of Qatar's men he burst into full cry on the sabjecc of his grievances. Since then, his complaints tc ^ne Political Agent have been made, in and out of season, on all sorts of occasions, at the sa.ne nign pitcu. pondence on the subject runs to about eightyjpages). 4. Hickinbotham, appar^trly after ^consultation with Sir Geoffrey Prior, replied to the Sheikh's complaints suggesting that 'should your Highness consider that your subjects are not being accorded by the Sheikh oi ^a^ar .he 'privileges which they received in tne pa^ o ^ , — is at liberty to take the matter up /ith -he ue ii (•v/' 'atar either'verbally or by direct correspondence'. Vv \b 5 # About ten days after I took over in April ^ast the Sheikh, with Belgrave's active help, repeated exactly the same gambit with me - Qatar took the sa^ie action - the Sheikh made the same complaints. For a whi.Xe, l eait with them by referring him to Hickinbotham's letter last quoted. But his argument, given verbally at great ^engt:, vas unanswerable. It was that the Political Agent haa not only initiated the negotiations for, and brought about the 1944 'agreement' but had also (Belgx^ave veriaie 1 ^ i.ls) advised the 0 sending of Bahrainis to Qatar - co test it. How Hickinbotham could then feel justified, in ^ie.v of the '.atar action, in washing his hands oi trie matter oy ue±±ing /the Sheikh.... The Hon'ble Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, O.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, (Camp) Shiraz .* zz** \ -2- the Sheikh to negotiate direct with Qatar, I do not know. Nor could I be expected to, since HicKinbotham had refused my written request to him for a handing over note with the remark that he would 'answer any questions'. Unfortunately most of them, as was natural, arose like this one, after he had left. 6. The next move by the Shaikh showed no originality. In May, both Belgrave and he wrote to me that (i) Bahrain juss gatherers had always before 1936 gone to the Qatar Coast to gather juss (ii) the June 1944 agreement restored conditions as they were ^/before 1936 (iii) the Sheikh of Qatar was not Sjh carrying out the 1944 Agreement because his men had just molested Bahraini juss gatherers on the Qatar Coast (iv) the Political Agent had motivated the 1944 AP'-ppftTnent and (the inmlication was.' ) it was up oO him Agreement and (the implication to see that it was carried out. 7. i referred this complaint to the Sheikh of Qatar and his reply was that (as is a fact) in 1938, he had issued orders prohibiting anyone from visiting the Qatar Coast. When Bahrain heard of this reply and returned to the charge I inquired from the : :heikh of atar whether (i) Bahrain subjects had not always visited the Qatar coasts to collect juss before the 1936 disputes (ii) his prohibition of the Qatar coasts to Bahrainis was cancelled by the 1944'Agreement'. The reply was a categorical negative to both questions 8. it may be as well to recall the^ phrase in the 1944 'agreement' upon which the Sheikh of Bahrain relies in these cases. It runs 'The Ruler of Bahrain and Ruler of Qatar agree to the restoration of friendly relations between them as they were in cue pabt.'. .. oa it is possible to argue that either Bahrain or Qatar is Justified in the line either has oaken in ^!i6 cases ouoted. The agreement is so vague that almost anytning can be argued therefrom. But ; must emphasise uhat no hope whatsoever, even if one argued and declied i-^ favour of Bahrain in these particular cases, is^percepuiDle by proceeding on these lines. The reason is tnis - the Sheikh of Bahrain does not care particularly whether a few of his subjects collect jus s on uhe Qatar Coa^t or graze their cattle on Qatar land. That he is interesLea in to the point of mono -mania ('It sours his wnole in e Belir'rave said) is in trying to establish his righx tc send his subjects to do these things - with a view ultimately to making such a 'right' one argument^in ^ favour of his sovereignty over Zubara. .ne oneiKri oi Qatar is perfectly aware of the position anc fully resolved to resist Bahrain 'infiltration'. ^ ruler v /orth the name could be expected oo do anything oe. 9# j hope it is clear from the foregoing that Sheikh Salman has at least some grounds, whether fully justified or not, for Complaint, ana -lar, one posi^iun I have been in of having to temporise is undignnied and perhaps unfair, and will have uo be mez. nuu tnere is another more important reason why matters cannot oe allowed to stay as they are. As I have alluded to ia my Demi-official letter No. P 8 dated - • J ', 'v rlU ? us ' 1945, concerning Bahrain Development, une cdiei^n is tending :o naKe thfe Qatar question a bargaining counter ifjiw /in all...-3- in all cases where his co-operation is required. The enclosed copies of correspondence forwarded to me by Packer of Petroleum concessions, Limited, are a further illustration of this tendency. As I wrote in my other letter we cannot allow it to be persisted in but the mere adoption of a negative attitude will not insure us the co-operation required. What then is to be said to the Sheikh when, with his countenance cast in an expression of catastrophic gloom, he again comes forward with his complaints .that the sheikh of Qatar is not observing the 1944 Agreement? 10. We should not try to have it both ways by, on the one hand, refusing to interpret the agreement and to enforce our interpretation and, on the other hand, by telling the sheikh of Bahrain that he must continue to observe it by not re-enforcing the blockade. If we cannot do the first we should be able to say to the Sheikh that if he considers the Sheikh of Qatar is not observing the agreement he himself may take any action he likes even if it involves setting aside the agreement anc- revertiiig to the conditions as they existed before it. Before we can think of doing this it is necessary to be clear as to the answers to two questions, viz., (i) What did the agreement achieve? (ii) If we told the Sheikh that he was at liberty to set it: would he do so? 1 11. The results of the agreement &gt;0^e set out at paragraph 4 of Hickinbotham 1 s despatch Ko. C /1424 dated the 4th October, 1944. I do not think tnat the alleged adverse effect on trade or on the con servation of shipping space (especially as tno *ar is now over) are developments to be feared trom a reversion to the conditions prior to ^ne agreement* But before making a similar decision regarding tne effect on the labour position in Bahrain of a pro hibition of the entry of Qatari labour, I would have very carefully to ascertain the amount of Qatari labour employed in Bahrain especially in the oil company since the possible loss of any labour irom Bahrain is not to be contemplated with equanimity. When in the course of my many conversations with the Sheikh I touched tentatively on the possiDility of reverting to the conditions prior to the agreemeno he carefully avoided making any suggestion ol a reply to my implied question. The reason for this was suggested to me by a remark of Belgrave s that ohe 3heikh did not wish to revert to the earlier conntions since the agreement had improved the positioii in Zubarah. I assumed that he referred zo trio removal of the guards from the fort there. to jfy conclusion, therefore, is that '..nen ^' ie Sheikh next complains that the jheiKn oi ^auar is noo fulfilling the terms of the agreement ne snoul: l oe told that he is at liberty to cake v/hatevor action he likes, even if it involves reverting to the conaicions orior'to the agreement provided taat two conditions are fulfilled (i) No adverse effects on the labour situation in Bahrain result from a reversion to the /previous-4- previous conditions. The fulfilment of this condition would depend on (a) the number of Qatari labourers in Bahrain, (b) whether even after setting aside the agreeraent the Sheikh would expel Qatari labourers from Bahrain (this is doubtful since it v/ould mean his losing the chance of acquiring extra subjects and this would be cutting off his nose to spite his face), (ii) There is a strong probability in view of the advantage gained at Zubarah that the Sheikh would not take action-to set aside the agreement (if he had been told he could do so and then he failed to taiie such action we would be in a very strong position). 13, As you will see, this letter is mainly for information and in order to apprise you of my ideas regarding my probable line of action in this matter. As the concluding paragraphs will show, I am unable, without further examination of zhe case, to make any concrete proposals for dealing with this question. .4 i. COPY.

I am sorry that we are adding to your problems. I notice that you mark your letter 'personal'. 7/ill it be in order for me to discuss our diTficuloies with the Political Agent and later to explain the situation to our Managing Director? ^ Before doing this, however, it has^occurred^ to me that you may care to put the following aspects of the matter to H.H. ^ Our Office combines Petroleum Concessions Ltd., Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, petroleum Development (Oman &amp; Dhofar) Limited as //ell as the ^ work in connection with Qatar, and the new accommodation for which we are planning caters for the needo dui ing the next few years of all these companies. After some years it is expected that Qatar will DJcorrie almost completely self -supporting. V The second aspect is 'that' the Ruler of Qatar has always objected strongly to the Company's use of Bahrain as a port for unloading its equipment and. as the local purchase centre. It has^long been a source of annoyance to him that Bahrain revenues benefit considerably from customs transit dues on^our oil equipment and. that Bahrain dhows bring water oo Zekhrit.' Nothing would delight -the Ruler more than to hear that difficulties have arisen for us i n Bahrain. in fact it can be expected tnat ne vyill take this opportunity to press the Company again .o use Dohah as its port thereby expediting the flow oi money and prosperity to his mair. pori:. It could be inferred from your letter that the obiect of n.H. 's attitude in the matter 01 P.C.L. accommodation is to induce the Company to use any influence it may possess, either directly or indiroctxy, to change the sheikh of Qatar's attitude on cne^ubarcui controversy.

No.C/622. 4 Dated the 11th June, 1946. Will you please refer to Felly's demi-official letter No.p. 12 r'ated the 23rd August, 1945, to me? 2. I enclose a copy of a letter which the Shaikh of Bahrain has addressed to me on the subject of Zubarah. I, like the Shaikh, do not propose to recapitulate the original causes of the dispute, nor do J propose to enumerate the manner in which shaikh Abdulla bin ^asim has failed to carry out the terras of the agreement. I think, in fact, it would be difficult to do so in view of the nebulous terms of the agreement, though possibly the maintenance of a guard by the Shaikh of ^atar in his tower at JALAT T IARIR is a definite instance. 3. While I have been political Agent, Bahrain, I have not heard so much of the Zubarah dispute as my predecessor, but the situation as regards feeling in Bahrain over the 'loss of Zubarah' is very much as stated in Felly's demi- official letter quoted above. I have, however, had many long talks with Shaikh Salman on the subject with the upshot that I asked him to state his case in the form of a letter. This he has now done. . '? 4. To turn to the Shaikh's letter, you will see that in paragraph 3 he states that the political Agent brought him the letter to sign, and that as it was the political Agent who conducted all the negotiations it is, therefore, the political Agent who must see that the 'agreement is carried out. This attitude is repeated in paragraph 6, and is logical enough. pob 5. A difficulty with which I am faced in approaching the problem is the vague wording of the agreement under which it is almost Impossible to tie any one party down to any one thing. I, myself, do not know what was really intended nor what reading the two shaikhs actually place on it. I know that Shaikh Salman reads into^more than it says. He writes that the meaning of the agreement is clear. That is wishful thinking, though if read with rickinbotham's explanatory letter No.0/968 dated the 21st June, 194^ (copy sent to you under cover of Agency letter Fo .c /968 dated the 24th June, 1944) the period of the hark back is clarified. I cannot conceive th ^t shaikh Salman was so simple at the time as to think thi/t he would get back all his 'rights' in Zubarah, nor that Abdulla would be so forthcoming as to ^'ive them back jus out of 'respect and courtesy'.

To consider the agreement sentence by sentence, the first sentence stipulates the restoration of friendly relations between the two Rulers 'as they were before'. This cannot but mean as they were before 1936 when the Shaikh of Qatar seized Zubarah and is an expression of bon visionage. 7. In the second sentence the Ruler of ^atar under takes that 'Zubarah shall remain without anything happening in it which was not there previously'. The meaning is difficult to follow, and 'previously' is not defined. Whether it means before ^atar built his tower or after I don't know. One would naturally suppose the former, but against that it seems unlikely that ^atar would so easily agree to demolish the tower he went to such pains to establish and in which he still maintains a guard. It is 'this guard and tower which rankle so with Salman. 8. In the next sentence the shaikh of Qatar affirms that ho is acting out of 'courtesy and respect for the Al T r halifah'. The translation of the agreement on the files does not use these words, but they are a more correct translation that the —orr^s 'consideration' and 'revoronc^'. ''hatev^r the accurate translation may be, this sentence may prove useful in discussions with the Shaikh of u atar for it would be useful to knov; what tks he undertook to do in the rather humble term 9. In the next sentence the Shaikh of Bahrain under takes to do nothing to harm the interests of the Ruler of ^atar. This sentence is horribly vague, and. it may refer either to Zubarah or Bahrain. It must be read to mean 'ir Zubarah' otherwise the Shaikh is not at liberty to take retaliatory measures against the z;hai v &gt; 1 of % atar should he wish to do so. 10. The last sentence concerns ^atar Concessions Limited and is not relevant to the present case. 11. You will probably agree that the document's meaning is vague even for an Arab document, and I think the first thing I should do is to endeavour to establish what Shaikh ^bdullah intended by the agreement. That will be- no easy thing, but if I can succeed, which I doubt, I shall have sorjthir to work on to meet Salman's 'minimum demands' under the agreement, that is to say, the withdrawal of the , c atar guard from the tower and freedom for Bahrainis to move about in Zubarah. His statement that ghaikh Abdulla agreed that conditions should return to what they were before 1936, and that he would restore to the Shaikh of Lahrain the'rights he held in Zubarah before that date - vide paragraph 5 of the shaikh's letter - are 'maxinma hopes'. 12. That the agreement in its present state is not workable is obvious and well known, and a course to /rectifyTHE AGENCY BAHRAIN -3- rectify matters which must be considered is its complete cancellation. I, myself, am loath to suggest this since the document was sponsored by the political authorities and for them to have to cancel it would be unfortunate, but it may come to that. Another point is that Jhaikh Salman could argue that the very existence and method of preparation of the document provide; him with political recognition of certain, rather uncertain, rights in ^ubarah. 13. I am tourinz to ^atar in a few days and after dis cussions with Shaikh Abdulla shall again address you.Translation of a letter dated ?Oth j/Uhani 1365 ( 'ay -—5 1946) from His Highness Shaikh Caiman to H.B.

I should like to point out that in this matter I did not deal directly with Shaikh Abdulla but the Agreement was made through the political Agen- who acted as mediator between us, it is therefore to the political Agent that I now protest that the terms of this Agreement have not been carried out by Shaikh Ab^ulla though they have been strictly carried out by myself and my people. 4.

So far as I can understand the position it has always been the policy of Govermi^ent to prevent the ohaikh of Bahrain from interfering on the mainland and i am of opinion that in no circuiastances could we recognise his sovereignty over Zubara.

It would require great pressure on the ^haiKh oi atar to make him destroy th^a tto^r himself as this woulc mean groat loss of face to him tout is there any possibility of his agreeing to the demolition if it is undertaken by Government?

J am afraid that I cannot add much of use at this period of time to the description of the status quo an.e the years 1936 and 1937 and might point out that the position was so nebulous that a clear description is, I should say, impossible. Up to 1936 certain of the Nairn tribe over whom the Shaikh of Bahrain claimed sovereignty used to graze taeir flocks at Zubarah without hindrance and paid taxes to neither Shaikh. To this might be added that certain members of the Ai Khalifah used to live at Zubarah and brought their camels and herds over from Bahrain to graze seasonally and occasional.! Also members of the Al Khalifah family used to proceed to Qatar for shooting trips. This situation was changed by Shaikh Abdullah's action, which was prompted by a movement in the oil world when Messrs. Lermitte and Dickson of petroleum Concessions Limited visited Zubarah, one by land and the other by sea, while making a preliminary survey for a port for landing equipment on the west coast of the Qatar penir.su _ci. Major Hickinbotham was political Agent at the time and his account was forwarded to the Residency under Agency letter No. C /333-4/13 dated the 3rd May, 1937. fo'' V ^ - v/ frit ' _sl ( 3^ His Majesty*s Government has agreed long^since f that Qatar has the greater claim to Zubarah and the situation cannot, I think, be put better than was done by Sir Trenchard Fowle in his telegram No. 680 dated the 4th July, 193 . The Government of India agreed with Sir Trenchard Fowle»s conclusions, but did not authorize a final closing of the Bahrain Zubarah claim, vide Government of India telegram No. 1562 dated the 6th July, 1937. It can be said, therefore, that Qatar's claim to sovereignty over Zubarah is ofjic-aliy ■ ' - recognised. 4. I do not think that anything has transpired since that decision was taken to alter the position. The Shaikh of Bahrain talks large about the graves of his ancestors, but Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah was most scorniuJ and said that he knew of no more than two, or at the most three, Al Khalifah graves in Zubarah. He said that they belonged to the dead and would continue to do so and that no one would interfere with them.

I am pretty sure that the Shaikh of Qatar would never agree to our demolishing the tower on his behalf as you suggest, and I do not think that you could insist on the Shaikh of Qatar evacuating it for I doubt if we should be on sufficiently strong ground, let alone the fact that as long ago as 1875 His Majesty s Government refused to intervene on behalf of the ShaiKn of Bahrain in Qatar. You may think that the 1944 agreement comes into the picture, but my view is that the divergencies of opinion of the two Shaikhs of the time of 'previously estops that. The Shaikh of Bahrain, backed by the Political Agent's letter (No. C/958 dated the 21st June, 1944, forwarded r- under our letter No. C/968 dated the 24th June, 1944), maintains that it means ante 1936, while the Shaikh of Qatar - which information I ascertained on my recent tour - maintains tnat it means ante the date of signature. This is reasonable, and I note that Hickinbotham makes no mention of discussion on the point in his Note dated the 18th June 1944, forwarded under Agency printed letter No. C/939 dated the 19June, 1944. I discussed the point with the ShaiKh but he to his opinion. The tower was built between the years 1^36 and 1944, and therefore the Shaikh of Bahrain can maintain that the Shaikh of Qatar has broken the agreement by building the tower but the Shaikh of Qatar would hold the reverse. • I broached the question of visits from the Al Khalifah and Bahrain subjects to Qatar and the Shaikh, rather Shaikh Hamad for Shaikh Abdullah was absent being sick, said that any member of the Al Khalifah would be most welcome in Zubarah, but that previous warning of their arrival would be necessary to enable the Al Thani to make suitable arrangements. 7 # as regards Bahrain subjects visiting Zubarah, he said that they might come and that they would be accorded the same treatment as Qataris visiting Bahrain. That seems fair enought and in keeping with the agreement for the status quo ante - so far as I know - was not that Qatar was open to all Bahrainis but that the rights of movement were as I have described them in paragraph two of this letter. 7 JANC.wmrnamm^m k Office of the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Gampt Bahrain, the 17th July 1946. Please refer to your letter No. G/733 dated 11th July 1946. The guiding principle in this cage seems to be that the sovereignty over Zubarah vests in the Shaikh of Qatar tout that for political reasons the Shaikh of Bahrain may not be to Id this. „ o 5. On the strength of Hickinbotham*s letter No, C/968 dated the 24th June 1944, I was under the impress ion up to date Uia t both parties recognised the fact that the agreement of 1944 'restored the status quo ante 1936'. It now appears that this is not the case and in these circumBtances the whole agreement is quite useless and we mua t endeavour to bring about another one. 4. I am still of opinion trjit our main effort should be to persuade the Shaikh of Qatar to leave the tower at Jalat Marir un~ garrison ad and un- repaired if he cannot be induced to demolish it. Circumstances now are very different from what they were in 1375 and I think it is incumbent upon us to e^dsavour to bring about some modus vivendi between the two Shaikhs. 5.

C /177 dated the 24th August 1944 which forwarded copies of an agreement reached between His Highness the Shaikh of Bthrain end the Shaikh of ^atar on the subject of Zubarah. a. Although this agreement has had the effect of putting an end to any outward manifestations of ill-fssling between the two Shaikhs it has I regret to report by no means settled the Zubarah question for good and al- ar J0 in fact Shaikh Salman has been plaguing successire Political Agents on the subject ever since. 3. only three months had passed since the signing of tae agreement when Shaikh Saljcan complained that the Shaikh of Qatar was not observing the agreement in tnat the tower built by the latter at Zubarah prior to the agree ment was still standing and that he had not return id the arms tajsen from Bahrain subjects during the disturbances 1936-37. It appeared at once that there was a fundamental difference of opinion between the two ^hai^is regard! tg the meaning of the phrase 'the Ruler of ^atar undertakes that Zubarah will remain without anything being done in it which had not existed in the past . Shaikh Salman inamtamed that this meant that everything should be restored as i t yaas before 1936 i.e, that the to^ver should be destroyed and all property taken should be returned. Jhaikh Abdullah on the other hand read It as meaning th*t he would not dis- turb the position as it existed at the time of the signing of the agreement. Major Hickinbotham w^o was respons io e for the framing and execution of the agreement supported Shaikh Abdullah^ interpretation and infonned Jhaikh Salman accordingly. As however Shaikh Salman had twice told Major Hickinbptham that he would be perfectly saiist led il the cuard in the fort at ^ubarah Tiere ittidrawn cifoits were made to persuade Shaikh Abdullah to take tnis step. He eventually agreed to do so and the guard was withdrawn except for a few watchmen in January 1945. in the mean while in December 1944 a representative from Bahrain had visited Qatar and held discussions witn Shaikh Abdullah in a most friendly atrocsphere. On the 24th January 1945 Shaikh Salman wrote a letter to Shaikh Abdullah asking for the return of the arms taken from his subjects and the restoration of the situation to what it was in the past, in this Istter he referred to Zubarah as 'my country'. In his reply bhaikh Abdullah used the following wordss / 'We- 2 - 'We have been surprised to see ^our Highness referring to Zu^arah as your country. Zubarah as eTerybody Knows is an inseparable part of ^atar. It is my country and not yours.^ As a result of this ahaikh aalman sent a strong protest to the Political Agent Yftio replied on instructions from this Residency that the Political Resident had never supported His Highness* claims to the Zuharah area. About this time Shaikh Salman sent some of his subjects to C^atar to graze their camels and flocks there as they used to do in the past. On their landing they were met by one of Shaikh Abdullah^ men who told them that they could not leave for Bahrain without his permission. This led to another protest from Shaikh Salman and ever s i ice he has been addressing the Political Resident and the Political A^ent about his 'rights' in Zubarah. In July 194b he even tried to make the favourable settlement of his claim to Zubarah a condition precedent to lease oi some land to the P.G.I'. According to my latest information the Jhalfe-n's subjects are now travelling to and from .atar without any interference and the chief thing that rarkies r Salman's mind is the existence of Shaikh Abdullah f s fort in the Zubarah area. The past history of the case however shows that the Al Khalifah's real object is to get Zubarah recognised as Bahrain territory. Shaikh Salman's obsession with the subject amounts almost to mental derangement, and I 8^ told that the same was the case with his father ohaiKh Hamad. 4. Wor the present I have instructed the Political Agent Bahrain to do his best to find some modus vivendi between Bahrain and qatar so as to avoid if possible a return to the blockade and boycott which existed from 1936 to 1944. I am afraid that there is little or no prospect that Shaikh Salman will ever cease from troubling us on the subject of Zubarah however definitely he may be told that his claiws to territory on the mainland cannot be supported* 5.

He saia he wan becoming a laughing stock of all the Ara^® bec^uee In spite of his friendship with the British he was unable to obtain uis rights. He did not refer at all to the tower in the course of the conversation but mentioned chiefly the restrict Ions the Shaikh of Qatar was placing on Bahrain subjects entering and leaving Zubarah. If I understood him rightly he stated that he did not claim sovereignty over Zul)«»rah but only wanted his grass and water. When I remarked that there was no profit for him in Zubarah he replied that it was not a matter profit as he knew that there was nothing of value in Zubarah but one of prestige. He said that Zubarah was of more importance to nim than anything else in the world and that so long as the present position existed he would continue to remain in a state of anguish. He finally said that he could not bear the present uncertainty and panted a decision one way or the other even though it was unfavooraole» I replied that I could not possibly give a decision until I naC heard what the Shaikh of Q^atar had to say on the subject and suggested that I might even have to inspect the spot. 5* As soon as I was able I brought the conversation round to the subject that I wished to talk to the Shaikh about. I said that now that the life of the oilfield and the income from it was assured for 50 years I thought that more ought to be spent on improving conditions in Manama and iluharraq* I referred to the lack of any development plant the bad state of the roadB&gt; to the need for a hotel, town planning etc. I also mentioned the difficulty that Colonel Blood-jforth had experienced in obtaining' land for an automatic exchange at Luharraq and to the unsatisfactory position that had been created by the faot that although Mr. Tunnicliffe is nominally Group Captain lisigh 's assistant he has not been placed in subordin ation to him. Shaikh Salman first said that he could not do anything until the Zubarah question had been settled» at which I showed obvious signs of annoyance. He then said that Bahrain was greatly in advance of the other Gulf States so far its administration was concerned, and that he could not be blamed for being conservative in expenditure when the oil refinery could be completely destroyed by one bomb. I did not argue matters at great length but contented myself on this occasion by giving the Shaikh myjviews. I think he had probably been informed beforehand \the subject regarding which I wished* to speak to him and briefed by Mr. Belgrave.

Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.I called on the Shaikh of Bahrain today to gire him an opportunity of explaining hie side of the oaae about Zubarah* Colonel Galloway and Mr* Belgrave were present during the interriew* ^ u The Shaikh based his olaims on a statement made / in Major Hiokinbotham*8 letter to him #o« 0/958 of the 21st June 1944 to the effect that Shaikh Abdullah of ^atar had made it clear to him that he was anxious for a restor ation of the friendly relations (s&amp;^aqa) which had existed between Bahrain and v^atar prior to the unfortunate troubled of 1936. The Shaikh apparently takes this to mean that Shaikh Abdullah and also GoTernment have agreed that the status quo in Zubarah should be restored exactly as it was before 1956 and he asked that if Goyemment were not prepared to stand by this undertaking they should inform him accordingly 9 3. When X asked the Shaikh to state his specific complaints against Shaikh Abdullah he said that his subjects Tisiting Zubarah were subjected to constant annoyance whereas no restrictions of any kind were placed on C^ataris yisiting Bahrain. Shaikh Salman attributed the state of affairs in Zubarah not to Shaikh Abdullah personally but to his son Shaikh Hamad* Shaikh Salman did not raise the question of the fort* 4. I asked the Shaikh whether he claimed sovereignty over Zubarah and he said he did not do so at present but merely wanted the position restored as it existed before 1936* 1st October 1946, i:ijpi'': D,0,Mo&gt; 832-S « The Residency# Bahrain» the ist October 1946* I forward herewith some papers which I accidentally took away with me after my interview with the Shairfh this morning.

The point is not of great importance, but one which I do think you might add is that Shaikh Salman showed us correspondence between himself and Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim in which the former had described Zubarah as his territory. This had been vigorously denied by Shaikh Abdullah. 4. I did not actually hear Salmon talk about Shaikh Hamad. 5. With regard to your paragraph 4, I agree that the Shaikh requires the situation restored to the spate existing before 1936 basing this on the Agreement and the above quoted Agency letter. 7 The Hon'ble Lt-Col.

As I informed Your Highness verbally on the afternoon of the 18th June at Ra'ffa, during my recent visit to Qatar Shaikh Abdullah bin ^asim Al Thani made clear to me that he was anxious for a restoration of the friendly relations which had existed between Bahrain and Qatar prior to the unfortunate troubles of 1936. in furtherance of this object the Shaikh of Qatar handed to me a draft of the terms of settlement which he hoped would be acceptable to ^JU jy**' c M 4 ^ m A_Jbli ♦ fc —- ^^&gt;-1 I fr.H jLuuJl L-u^JU* i # ^ .

The consideration in paragraph 4 of Mr. Packer's letter of 1st August to Mr. Belgrave is likely to carry most weight with the Shaikh. As regards his refusal to sell or lease land to P.C.L. we could, if necessary, presumably tell the Shaikh that he is adopting an unfriendly attitude to a British Company/ ^ 19. 20, 21. ^jiuuue \ 30.8.45 C* r fa 4* P.R,has to this the Shaikh of Qatar apparently built a fort and installed a garrison in the Zubara area and ttB evacuation (if not the destruction) of the fort and the withdrawal of the garrison would be required fully to restore the status quo ante 1936.

Shaikh Salman however wishes to send some of his people and camels over this autumn and to that end I approached Sheikhs Hamad and Abdullah. 3. Both emphatically informed me that the Sheikhs, their people and their animals would be treated with the utmost respect and would not suffer at the hands of the Qatar Governuteht nor the Qatar people. 4. Sheikh Abdullah himself said that they would be welcome but that they must live in tents and that the erection of any sort of building would not be allowed. This seemed to me reasonable but I did not comment. 5. I pointed out that some of Salman's people might be Naim and that Sheikh Salman would possibly consider them his subjects. Sheikh Abdullah said that Qatar Naimis were Qatar Subjects and that if they returned to Qatar they would be subjected to Qatar Law. Shaikh Abdullah said that there was a Shariah Court. 6. He added that if Qatar people went to Bahrain they were subjected to Bahrain Laws but that on their return to Qatar obviously they reverted to Qatar Laws. This was quite obvious and as it is agreed that Shaikh Salman has no sovereign power in Qatar I again made no comment, but accepted the statement. 7 # As regards the tower of Jalat Marir, Abdullah said that it was ruined and that his people were in his fort and would not molest the Bahrain people. ^Copy of this note should be sent to P.A.

I Called 'on the Shaikh of Bahrain on the Sy 2nd of November, 1946, and had a long talk with him on the subject of .^atar. ^J-told the Shaikh the f v results of my recent visit to Qatar, vide N/paras.Mb-^3 The Shaikh, as usual, expressed doubts as to the genuine ness of the feelings expressed by the Shaikhs of Qatar and I was left with^the usual impression that he did not really wish the matter settled on the lines on which we are now working. This conversation lasted two hours during which the Shaikh said that he had hoped that I would settle the problem for him and that indeed the Resident had given him to expect that when he wrote his letter .. I pointed out to the Shaikh that the Resident had said no such thing to the best of my knowledge and that he should not jump to that conclusion. He said that the matter has been hanging fire for a long time and that I had never given him a definite reply. I replied that there were many reasons why I was hesitant in the matter and that one was not because I did not know how to deal with the real claim. I said that it was not just to put the onus (of delay) on me and that if he really wished an early reply he must be prepared for me to say that in my opining he (the Shaikh) had no rights whatsoever in Qatar or Zubara. I advised him to let us deal with the matter in our own way. He talked a good deal more about his StT claims going back as far as Turkish days and I said that if he wished to go back to the Turkish days I could go as far back as Persian days in Bahrain. I also said th^t there were other matters concerning the Bahrain boundaries which were in the melting pot. Finally the Shaikh said that his claim ^ was that 'he should have' - I could not get a clearer Arabic expression out of him - 'the port of Zubara &lt;^5 territory^ the houses in Zubara and the Lisha, and Halwan and Um-Saicha and Um-Alma and the mosques and the graveyards and his freedom and that of his people on the sea coast from A1 Arish to Um Alma and in the desert of the land without interference. A few days later the Shaikh called on me 47 and informed me that the Shaikh of Qatar had sent over Bin Omran, the Qatar Director of Customs, with X friendly letters from himself and his son Hamad to the Shaikh of Bahrain. He did not show me the letters and I said that they were a good sign and asked what more the Shaikh wanted. He replied that the letters were warm in words but cold in heart. I believe the Shaikh wishes concrete rights in the port of Zubara which he may think will be developed as a landing port between Bahrain and Qatar. The case still rests with the Residents ^ (Colonel Hay f s) statement to Shaikh Salman that he v^ill tour to Zubara this cold weather. A copy of this note should be sent to the 5*7.

It contains details of British mediation efforts between the two sides and also includes the text (in English and Arabic) of a reconciliation agreement between the two sides from 1944.The file also contains a translation of an Arabic-language letter published in the Cairo publication 'Rabitat Al Arabieh' (f. 25). The letter is from a Bahraini and argues that the British had sided with Qatar in the conflict regarding Zubarah as they were afraid that if under Bahraini control, the concession for oil deposits near the town would be given to an American (as opposed to British) oil company as had been done in Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>National Economy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rights of states</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arab nationalism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Social reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000158#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
