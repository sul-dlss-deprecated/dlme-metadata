Dsoaobar 23, 1949. KHtii ftf IffllMWt Rfor dear Sir Rupert PXmm r»f#r to your Xottor No,478/6/49 dated the 17th Noveaber # 1949. 2. The recent refusal to allow His Ajesty's Pakistan Ships to risit Khor Kueai was not the result of a misunderstanding* His Highmss the Sultan is quite firm in his desire that as a natter of poliqy as countiy'a warship should visit any part of his territories, other than the Capital, except Hie ifejesty’s Ships and ships of the United States Ha^r. These he regards in a special category in view of his Treaty relations, hut he feels it is impossible to extend the scope of this special treatment to include any other country, even a washer of the British Courconwealth without asking it acre difficult to adhere to this poliqy 3* I have discussed this with Hoods-B&amp;llard, sad put forward every argument that I oan think of, but he says His Highness knows then all, and is quite set In hie purpose* 4* On the ether hand Kis Highness has just oonplated very friendly visits to India and Pakistan, and da sire 3 to renaln upon the best tens with tl&lt;ea* He does not therefore wish his refusal to go in such a way that offence will be caused* As his relations with Pakistan are being conducted by us, he trusts that we will be able to put it in such a war that no offenoe will be oaueed* 5. I have explained our difficulty over this, for since we find it hard to convince ourselves of the reasonableness of this refusal, it is hard to convince others* Uoreover our Navy, who upon occasions wust operate in joint manoeuvres etc* with ships of His Majesty*a Pakistan,™* Indian and other Commonwealth Navies, will be placed in s veiy awkward position if upon approach to Muscat and Oman waters, they have to separate from the others. 6. I have suggested that, if no other port, surely Khor Kuwal separated as it is from the mainland, virtually uninhabited and consist* ing of only a snail almost unused British Haval base, could be an exception to the rule, but to no avail* In the circumstances I have not, as I intended, spoken to His highness himself, because if X meet now with a complete refusal from hla* as Noods-fiallard advises wa I shall, it will detract from aiy chance of smooees that you my have, if you see fit to hzWoob the subject yourself when you visit in Januaryynsxt* 8* If Hla Hlghnsaa still persists in this attituds, I foal it be nsosseasy to tall hla that we oan only stats what X have said in paragraph 2 of this latter, if that is correct, and hops that the Pakistan Government will not take it amiss* With the best will in the world, 1 do not see how we can devise say more palatable way of putting t it, exoapt perhaps to add that other than in the Capital, the people of these territories are unused to visits of warships, and the Sultan la afraid of incidents or panics or soma such thing* His Excellency Sir Rupert Kay, K.C.IJS., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, &amp;&amp;£&amp;* Yours sincerely.?// The Persian Gulf Residency, Bahr ain. c X 478 / 6/49 17th November 1949. Cc In your telegram 208 of the 2nd i November, you state that the Muscat Govern- J-y, ment are under the impression that the Pak- (I istan Government have already been informed that they do not want foreign warships to visit any part of the Sultan f s territories other than the capital. So far as I am aware the Pakistan Government have neser Oi / been informed to this effect by this Residency or by the Muscat Political Agency. J ^ All I know is that some time ago when the ■ '* f)/ j Pakistan Government asked for permission for one of their ships to visit Gwadur this was refused on the grounds that the Sultan thought that one of their ships ought to pay a courtesy visit to his capital before any.of them visited any other part of his dominions. such a visit has now been paid. ^ therei ore, there may have been some // Vni sunder standing in this case and I should be grate! uj. i! you would kindly ascertain from the Sultan at an early opportunity whether he has any objections to His Majesty*s Pakistan Navy ships visiting Khor Kuwai in consultation with the Senior Navgl Officer Persian Gulf, with, il necessary, his prior permission in each case. I tnink it is a little ungracious'” of the Sultan to refuse permission for such visits and 1 snould like to be able to inform the Plag Officer, Royal Pakistan Navy through the Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf that the „ .../recent&lt; © 2 . recent refusal of permission recently was due to a misunderstanding. kajor F.C.L.

Sir, I have the honour to report that the H.&amp;LP.S. 1 Jhelua*, flagship of the Royal Pakistan Navy, under the eooiaand of Lt-Commander C.S. Ahoad, paid a visit to Muscat on the 17th and I8th of this month* Though the ostensible reascm for the visit was the transport from Karachi of certain gunpowder belonging to the Muscat Government, apparently the actual intention was to show the flag, for which purpose the 'Jhalua 1 has been largely used during the past year* The visit was originally scheduled for one day only, and calls were exchanged between wyself and the Commanding Officer of the v Jhelua 1 soon after arrival* I then took Lt-Comiaander C*S* Ahmad and his Secretary, Lt-Comnander Maqbul Hussain to call on the Sultans no provision for a return call had been made, as His Highness had insisted that the visit should be treated as semi-formal. However, during the interview Lt-Commander Ahmad invited His Highness on board to lunch the following day, saying that he would delay the departure of the ship especially for the occasion: and this invitation was accepted* Entertainment s for the 1 Jhelua 1 included hockey and volley ball watches against the Muscat State Infantry, a tea party given at the Consulate Club by the Pakistani Community for the officers and local notables, and a dinner party at the Agency for senior officers members of the Royal Family* In return, a cinema show was givwn on board, and the ship thrown open to the public from S to 10 on the following day* The luncheon party for His Highness was, in accordance with his wishes, informal, being attended by Mr* Woods-Ballard, Saiyid Faher and ay self, and although the ship was dressed, a salute was fired only at the Sultan 1 1 departure * The visit was successful and surprisingly popular not only with the Pakistani community but also with the general populace* Lt-Commander Ahmad, however, had one complaint to make, the refusal of the Muscatis to accept Pakistani money from his men on shore* Arrangements were made for ordinary rupees to be changed for Pakistani rupees at this Agency, but the grievance unfortunately remained, aa all officers clearly felt it involved a question of national prestige and the flavouring of India at the expense of Pakistan* This was not, however, mentioned in the full description of the visit put over the Pakistan Radio the next day* His Excellency the I have the honour to be.
