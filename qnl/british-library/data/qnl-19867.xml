Wilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of telegraphic correspondence, I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, on the difficulty which has arisen at Bahrein in connection with an attempted settlement at Zobarah. 2. Early in March the Albin-Ali tribe, incensed at some violence done to one of their chief men by the brother of Sheikh Esa of Bahrein, talked of re moving to the Katr Peninsula. A few days later an attempt to seize some of the Albin-Ali concerned in a quarrel with certain goldsmiths led to a collision in which shots were exchanged and two men on each side were killed. Sheikh Sul- tan-bin-Mohamed Salamah, the head of the tribe, then left Bahrein with some of his leading men, and went in the first place to Roweis near the north point of the Katr Peninsula, whence the local Chief attempted ostensibly at least to arrange matters. Sheikh Sultan almost immediately got into communication with Sheikh ]asim-bin-Thani, who also professedly exerted his good offices to settle the difference. There can, however, hardly be a doubt that Jasim, whether or no he fostered the quarrel from the beginning, very soon saw in it a means to further his own aims and to carry out a design which he has before attempted, of a settlement at Zobarah. 3. Accordingly, early in April a letter from the Bahrein Chief intimated that though he had not been seriously concerned at the alienation of Sheikh Sultan, the object now declared, of a settlement at Zobarah, was a serious menace and injury to his position at Bahrein. The Chief further said he could turn the in truders out by force if thought advisable. I then reported the matter to Govern ment by telegram ; and upon the receipt of the instructions contained in your telegram of the 21st April, requested the Commander of H. M, S. Bramble to proceed to Bahrein with Mr. Gaskin, Assistant to the Resident, in order to communicate to Sheikh Jasim the warning which I had been directed to convey- to him. • I enclose for reference copy, in translation, of my letter to Sheikh Jasim, and of a letter which I thought it advisable to address to Sheikh Sultan. The Bramble sailed on 22nd and returned on the evening of the 26th with Sheikh Sultan's reply to my letter, and the information which Lieutenant Commander Currey and Mr. Gaskin had been able to obtain. Sheikh Jasim being in the interior at some days' distance from Zobarah, his answer only reached me by mail on the 1st May. Copies, in translation, of these two letters are en closed for reference. 4. The position as gathered from further reports of the Residency Agent by the mail, supplementing the information brought by H. M. S. Bramble, has become somewhat complicated. My instructions to Mr. Gaskin, apart from the warnings he was to convey, were to use every endeavour to induce the Sheikh of Bahrein and Sheikh Sultan to accept his good offices towards a reconciliation. These instructions were carried out by Mr. Gaskin with care and judgment, but unfortunately with little result, owing probably to the outside influences at x work. Sheikh Sultan refused to return to Bahreirt immediately, except practi cally under compulsion, which would have been useless. He stated that it was onlv after leaving Bahrein that on his appeal to Sheikh Jasim, and on the latter's invitation, he went to Zobarah; and at his desire that he had raised the Turk ish flag there, which, however, he agreed to remove: it had, in fact, ceased to fly before the Bramble left. Sheikh Esa evidently considered that Sheikh Sultan had too far identified himself with the enemies of Bahrein to return to his allegi ance. He declined to accept a condition of his return which Sheikh Sultan had proposed, viz. —that the tribe should be allowed a separate habitat at El-Had, a village a few miles from the Chief's headquarters; holding that this would be fatal to his own authority and would facilitate the designs of Sheikh Jasim and his enemies to usurp his authority and ultimately overthrow his rule. He accord- ingly preferred that Sheikh Sultan and his tribe should sever their connection from Bahrein altogether.c. Important later news is that a few days after the departure of H. M. S. Brawble the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa arrived with the intention of taking the mail steamer to Busrah; but on learning the state ot affairs, and being met by a letter from Tasim, he abandoned that design and proceeded instead at once to Zobarah. lasim's letter is said to have informed the Mutasarrif of the purport of the warning he had received from me, and added that the removal of settlers ■a\ 7obarah was a matter for the Turkish authorities; that it was desirable to raise the'Turkish flag, and that he awaited the arrival of the Mutasarrif there. It is further reported by the Residency Agent that information had reached him that representatives of the Manasir and Beni-Hajir tribes had visited Sheikh Sultan, had received valuable presents, and had entered into compacts to support him. 6. Sheikh Sultan in his letter asks for delay in obeying the order for his removal at the close of the pearl season. Such delay is, in my opinion, quite inadmissible : it is not justified by any necessity of the situation, and can only be Intended to afford time for consolidating the position and for the operation ot intrio-ues to secure its permanence. I regard his expressed readiness to be reconciled with his Chief as empty words, and consider that he now feels himself too much enmeshed in the intrigues of Jasim and others to return to his former nosition under Bahrein. Should he thoroughly realize that his aspirations for a settlement at Zobarah, supported by Jasim and local Chiefs with possibly Turkish connivance, are hopeless, his attitude might very probably change. Sheikh Tasim's letter is evidently merely an evasion, and his pretence of looking for our assistance in proceedings which he well knows to be direct y oDDosed to the policy of Government, is curiously bold. By the ' owners to whom he proposes to leave Katr, he must be taken to mean the Turks. 7. Bahrein trade has increased, and to this fact may probably be attributed the movement with regard to Zobarah, which now threatens to assume more imnortance A settlement there fostered by Jasim's machinations, with possibly higher support, is regarded by Sheikh Esa as fatal to the well-being of Bahrein. It would I consider, lead to grave complications, besides furnishing a base tor actual aggression. The Albin-Ali who have gone there are said to number some i sol including women and children; and should success be permitted to -ittend 'their movement, it is to be feared that the Naeem, Chaban and Dawasir tribes might be seduced from their allegiance to Bahrein and be led to abandon it and join the seceders to its entire ruin. 8 On the foregoing considerations I am led to the conclusion that the threatened situation'calls for absolute prohibition to be carried into effect by force ic n^poccarv I therefore ventured to recommend in my telegram of the 2nd that I should be authorised to enforce the demand upon the Albin-Ah to evacuate 7nbarah bv seizing their boats if necessary. A distinct threat in this sense would, 1 hope, suffice—to be followed by action only if required by the circumstances. — — f No. 75, dated Busbire, the 22nd April 1895. From— colonel F. A.

You are well aware that such a settlement at Zobarah is in direct opposition to the will of the Government. 1 have now received the orders of Government m this matter and I accordingly have to convey to you a strong and very distinct warning that such a settlement will not be permitted. \ ou will therefore clear y undersfand that, in order to retain the favour and ^ 0 r ^ e G d 0Vernment ' ) 0U must at once abandon any such project which will not be tolerated. 34 I confidently expect an early and satisfactory reply from you, as this matter will not admit of uncertainty or delay.

After compliments. —It has been reported to me that you propose, in defiance of the wish of your Chief, Sheikh Esa-bin-Ali, to form a settlement at Zobarah, and that you have the support and assistance of Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani herein. It has been necessary accordingly to address a very strong warning on the part of Government to Sheikh Jasim, that this will not be permitted. You will also understand for yourself that any such action of yours will not be tolerated. Mr. Gaskin, an Assistant in this Residency, has been desired to explain all this clearly to you ; and should you happily be wisely disposed in this matter, Mr. Gaskin will afford you his good offices to regain the favour of Sheikh Esa and to receive indulgence from him. I have every hope that in this way all difficulties may be arranged. But should you unfortunately not listen to this friendly advice, you will be liable to the grave displeasure of Government, and to very serious consequences, as on no account will such a settlement be permitted. i.i sorh Shawal i3ta Dated the 2Sth Aprilf 8 95 . From— Sultan-bin-Mohamed-bin-Salamah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After compliments. —Your esteemed letter has been received and its purport understood. You have informed and ordered me that Zobarah should not be inhabited. Learn, oh friend ! that the origin of our departure from Bahrein arose out of a desire to stop a further development of the occurrences of which you are aware. Such being the case, what are we to do when you order that we should not reside in Zobarah, and we cannot go against your orders ? We have been under your orders and in obedience to you from olden times, and we have committed no action which is opposed to your wishes. Now our condition is weak as is known to you. The present is the season of our liveli hood, and half the number of our boats have been sent to Bahrein for being equipped for the work, and we cannot therefore obtain the means of moving from this place at once. We hope, therefore, that you will allow us time until the end of the pearl season, and then we shall not linger here. You can rest quite assured in all respects, so far as we are concerned. It is not possible for us to go against you. Our hope is in you and in the kindness of the great Government, that time will be allowed us; but if not, yours is the order. If we could know that a sincere understanding can be effected between us and Sheikh Esa, we would obey him and you. As long as we live no offence shall be committed either by myself or my followers.

I wrote to you a letter before.5 After I had perused your letter which was wrongly addressed to me, I received your letter dated the and perused it. I found in it observations which are contrary to the friendship and good will which I cherish towards you— to the defence of the security which I maintain against evii of all sorts—to the settlement of those people at Zobarah and the conciliation which has been effected by me between them and Sheikh Esa, and to the guarantee which I have given that no misfortune shall befall them, nor shall they commit any aggression themselves. All this which 1 have done has been with the object of maintaining unbroken the bonds of cordial friendship which has existed of old between you and me. And as long as I possess that friendship from you I shall not look for it to others. But if I do not get from you the assistance and co-operation, it is needless for me to involve myself in the task of guaranteeing in any degree whatever the preservation of security on land and sea. And I shall leave Katr to its owners and save myself from troubles. I shall goto Zobarah on Monday to meet you and discuss matters personally, if an interview be- possible.

In continuation of correspondence ending with my telegram of the 8th in stant, I have the honour to report in fuller detail for the inlormation of the Gov ernment of India—• 2. In a letter by the last mail the Residency Agent at Bahrein reports, under date the 7th instant, that he had learned from people arriving from Zoba- rah that the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa on reaching Zobarah summoned Sheikh Jasim, who, sending on some masons and soldiers in advance, himself arrived on the 5th, and that they together set up a flag-staff for the Turkish flag. The report does not specifically state whether the flag had up to the date of the informa tion been actually hoisted. It was further stated that musjids and houses were building. It is added by the Residency Agent that some regarded the arrival of the Mutasarrif as being with the express purpose of visiting Zobarah, the origin ally expressed intention of going on to Busrah being only for the purpose of concealing the real object. 3. It would appear that some years ago, when the question of the Turkish occupation of Zobarah was dealt with, doubts prevailed at the India Office as to the validity of the Bahrein claim to Zobarah, as against Turkish pretension— vide correspondence forw r arded under your endorsement No. 2362-E of the 4th Novem ber 1890. For this I am quite unable to account, as I am unaware of the grounds on which such pretensions on the part of Turkey were based. And the narrative at pages 362 et seg. of the Selections from the Records of the Bombay Govern ment, No. XXIV of 1856, would seem to show that the present holders of Bah rein originally settled at Zobarah in 1 766, and thence effected the conquest of Bahrein some 15 years later. No. 46, dated Bushire, the 18th May 1895. From —colonel F. A. Wilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 44, of the 1 ith instant, I have the honour to communicate, for the information of Government, the purport of further re ports received from the Residency Agent at Bahrein, by the mail yesterday. 2. The Mutasarrif of El-Hasa after a stay of more than a week at Zobarah, and having given, it is said, assurances of support and full protection to Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani and Sultan-bin-Salamah, and having promised to send a Mudir or Governor with some soldiers to Zobarah, himself left for Ojair and El-Hasa. The Mudir and soldiers sent from the former place are reported as having arriv ed at Zobarah about the 13th instant, and building operations as being in progress. The Mutasarrif again took the main island of Bahrein en route to Katif, halting for a night at Agarria and leaving for Katif on the 15th instant. Sheikh Jasim had helped Sheikh Sultan to equip his boats, which were starting for the pearling about the 12th instant. 3. Nasir-bin-Mubarik, a relative of Sheikh Esa of Bahrein, is also expected on the scene, being reported as encamped with a Beni-Hajir following between El-Hasa and Ojair. This man's restlessness and intrigues have constantly been / a source of apprehension to Sheikh Esa. The last menace to the safety of Bahrein from this quarter was in October 1894 as noted in the Political diary of this office for the week ending 3rd November 1894, Part VI, item 7, and a previous one was reported in my predecessor's letter No. lie. dated iSth August 1892.No. 52, dated Bushire, the 24th May 1895. From—C olonel F. A. 'VViLsoy, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreig-n Department. In continuation of previous correspondence, I have tlie honour to forward, for the information of Government, translation of a letter of the 21st instant, from the Chief of Bahrein, giving the recent movements of the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa in connection with the intrigues to establish a settlement at Zobarah. 2. Prom the reports of the Residency Agent at Bahrein it appears that by direction of the Mutasarrif a memorial had been prepared by Sheikh Sultan-bin- Salamah and signed by his principal tribesmen, appealing for Turkish support and protection, and that a caravanserai and houses for Sheikhs Jasim, Sultan and others are being built. Tbe Mutasarrif left Bahrein by the mail steamer bringing these reports, taking with him Mohamed Abdul Wahab on the part of Sheikh Jasim and the petition referred to for presentation to superior authority. 3. There can no longer be any doubt that the intrigue, having for its object the establishment of a position which the Bahrein Chief regards—and as I con sider, w T ith justice—a grave menace to his security and an unjust encroachment on his ancestral territories, is actively fostered by the local Turkish authority. It is evident'also that Sheikh Sultan's profession of submission as previous ly reported, and his plea for merely a delay in the enforcement of his departure from Zobarah, -were insincere. Dated the 25th Dilkada 1312-(21st May 1895). From— Sheikh Esa-bin-Ali , Chief of Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I beg to state that I reported to you in detail the case of the people of Zobarah, and have kept your Agent in Bahrein fully informed regarding the progress of events with a view to your being in possession of the news. As regards the Mutasarrif and his doings and plans I have been somewhat apprehensive, as he is the reverse of his predecessors. When he arrived at Bahrein the first time, he went to Zobarah and gave assurances of safety to the people of the place. He then went to Ojair and summoned Nasir-bin-Mu- barak and his Beni-IIajir followers, and had a consultation with them. He again returned to Bahrein (Agarria) and after two days' stay went to Katif. He has again come to Bahrein, but 1 have not learnt what his object is. I have no mind to talk to him, and I observe an attitude of indifference towards him in order to secure your approval. I hope that you w r ill bear this case (the movements of the Mutasarrif) in mind, and also the previous case (about Zobarah). My trust is in God and then in the greatness of your power.

By the lapse of time (since your depar ture) joy has returned to them (the people of Zobarah), and their desire has in creased towards building operations, Howards contracting friendship with the Bedouins, for the purpose of inducing them to settle at Zobarah, and towards misleading the inhabitants of Bahrein to them. I have kept K.halil in formed of every fresh incident which has occurred in their affairs for com munication to you. I have ascertained that those people are loudly indulging in utterances which are distasteful to me and to you alike. The Mudir, whom the Muta sarrif has placed over them, constantly declaims in an absurd manner against the British Government in order to create an impression of its eakness, and forbear transmitting to you w T hat he says of the British Government.

From—The Under-Secretary of State, India Office, To—The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office. With reference to the correspondence ending with Sir T. Sanderson's letter of the 2'ith March 1894, I am desired by rvrfepasre 106, Volume x, Aitchu ]y£ r&lt; Fowler to inform you that the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf reported on the 17th April that the Albin-Ali tribe, a branch of the Uttobees, who made them selves masters of Bahrein in 1783, have deserted and are forming a settlement at Zobarah with the support of Shaikh Jasim of Bidaa. 2. The Government of India authorised the Resident to warn Shaikh Jasim that the settlement would not be allowed, and the Resident reports that a Turkish official, the Mutasarrif of Hasa has gone to Zobarah and the settle ment is being pushed on, Shaikh Jasim acting in concert with the Mutasarrif, w r ho is preparing to hoist the Turkish flag. 3. The Resident wishes to enforce the warning by seizing the Albin Ali's boats. The Government of India say that this might raise the question of the Turkish jurisdiction in El-Katr. The settlement at Zobarah is, however, a menace to Bahrein ; and if Her Majesty's Government permit, the Viceroy would authorise the Resident to act us he has proposed. 4. In accordance with the policy pursued in 1891, Mr. Fowler proposes, with the concurrence of the Earl of Kimberley, to i^Lr tter to Fomgu office, sth AueniBt sanction the seizure of the boats of the Albin-Ali if that tribe persists in effecting a settlement at Zobarah. 5. I am to add that a further telegram dated 21st May, of which a copy is enclosed, has been received from the Viceroy stating that it is reported that the Mudir (of El-Bidaa ?) with some Turkish troops sent by the Mutasarrif arrived at Zobarah during the past week. 6. This military movement constitutes a serious menace to Bahrein; and as the Porte has been repeatedly informed that Bahrein is under British pro tection, Mr. Fowler is of opinion that the Porte should be warned that mea sures will be taken to protect the Chief of Bahrein from Turkish aggression.

I am intimating Sphinx that no attention need be paid to claim, and seizure boats may be prosecuted. Ends. Shaikh Sultan is head of Albin-Ali at Zobarah. The action taken in the matter has been approved. Enclosures in Admiralty covenvg letter oj 19th June 1835, Dated Bushire, the 4tli May 1885. From— C aptain J. H. P elly , Commander H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' at Bushire, To— R ear- A dmiual E. C. D rummond. I have the honour to report that I arrived at Bushire on the 27th April and relieved Lieutenant and Commander Currey, H.M S. Bramble (who had arrived the day previous from Bahrein) as Senior Ollicer, Persian Gulf Division. 2. With reference to the recent difficulty that had arisen at Bahrein, ne cessitating the services of the there, it appearst hat Shaikh Sultan- bin-Mahome l Salamah, a subject of Bahrein, had, in defiance of the will of his Chief, departed to Zobarah with his tribe, the Albin-Ali, and intended forming a settlement there with the support of Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani. 3. Such a settlement being in direct opposition to the declared policy of Government, Mr. Gaskin, Vice-Consul, was deputed to convey to Sheikh Sultan- bin-Mohamed Salamah a strong warning that such a proceeding would not be permitted; and in order that las mission might be the more increased in force and authority by the presence of a man-of-war there, the services of H .' M l S , Bramble were requisitioned for this purpose. 4. A report of the movements of the Bramble and the result of this mission is given in Lieutenant and Commander Currey's letter to Colonel V. A. Wilson, on his return to Bushire, a copy of which is forwarded herewith for your information. 5. The Political President is in communication with the Government of India as to the steps to be taken in regard to this matter, and has requested me to remain here to be in readiness to convey him to Bahrein if necessary. Dated Bushire, the 26th April 1895. jr rorn Lieutenant E. H. C uhrey , Commander, H. M. S. Bramble, T q C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to inform you, in accordance with your memorandum to me (No. 185, dated 21st April 18^5), that having embarked Mr. Gaskin, Assist ant Political Resident at Bushire, and also Mahomed Rahim, Residency Agent / at Bahrein, I left Bushire on Monday, April 22nd, arriving at Bahrein the fol lowing dav. Upon my arrival I landed, accompanied by Mr. Gaskin and Mahomed Rahim and paid a visit to the Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali. The Shaikh Esa- bin-Ali stated his case and ended by assuring us that he was prepared to swear by the Koran that should Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed Salamah return to \ Bahrein he was prepared to receive him as if nothing had happened, and to allow him and his tribe to reside in Bahrein as before. Havin 0, received this assurance, I left the following day, Wednesday, April 24th, and jrroceeded to Zobarah, where I arrived in the evening. On account of the shallowness of the water of this place, I was oblio-ed to anchor a long way from the shore, some 4 miles out, and in consequence Mr. Gaskin, Mahomed Rahim, and I did not reach the shore till after 6 o'clock, and Mr. Gaskin did not have time to finish his conversation with Shaikh Sultan- • * 34 bin-Mahomed Salamali, as we ivere obliged to return to the ship before complete darkness set in, owing to the great distance she was from the shore. However before leaving. Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed Salamah stated that lie would come back to Bahrein with us i£ we took him by force, but that he ■would not come of his own free will. Mr Gaskin and I agreed that the best thing to do under the circum stances was to leave Mahomed Rahim on shore for the night to see it he couK persuade Sultan -bin-Mahomed Salamah to do what was required of him, and said that we should return in the morning for his answer. We accordingly left the ship at 5 a.m . upon Thursday, April 25th, and upon our way on shore encountered Mahomed Rahim coming olT in a native boat, lie informed us that Shaikh Sultan -bin-Mahomed Salamah had left d ur ine the night to confer with Shaikh Jasim -bin-Thani, and that the latter w as a^ay 4 days' journey into the interior. He had stated before leaving that he was prepared to leave Zobarah if H. M.'s Government insisted, but that he would not return to Bahrein and place himself under the Government of Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali of that place. I left Zobarah at 7 a.m . and arrived back at Bahrein at 2-30 P .m » Mr. Gaskin, accompanied by Mahomed Rahim, left the ship to interview Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali. Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali explained to Mr. Gaskin that, with a view to avoid future conflicts, he would rather that Sultan-bin-Mahomed Salamah did not return to Bahrein. Having received this answer I left Bahrein at O-SO p.si ., arriving at Bushire at 5 p.m . the following day, April 26th. No. 69, dated Bushir«, the 13th July 1H95. pi- om Colonel F. A.

TVith reference to mv telegram of the 11th instant, X have the honour to report more fully, for the information of the Government of India, on the action that has been taken on your telegram of the 3rd instant. 2. H. M. S. Sphinx sailed on the 5th with my letter conveying the orders which Government had directed should be * ^ s \ ail ; r h Sultan ' No - 133 ' dat€&lt;l issued to Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mohamed Salamah. 5 ' U} ^ d A translation of this,* and copy of my letterf to + No ^z: ,dated5thJu,y 1895,anti Commander Pelly, R.N., are enclosed for re- enciosure. ference. In my letter to Shaikh Sultan I was careful to leave the door open to him for submission to the orders of Govern ment and to his duty to his Chief. Owing, however, to the influence of the Turkish Mudir probably, it was very ill received by the Shaikh, who, when it was at last and after an abortive attempt on the part of two Turkish soldiers to bar the wav, presented to him by my Extra Assistant Mr. Gaskin, took an obiectionable* and even offensive tone. With my letter was delivered a se cond letter from Commander Pelly, a previous one having received no reply, and Captain Pelly in consequence of the insolent refusal to send any reply, which had been made to Mr. Gaskin, proceeded on the following morning, the 8th, to \ seize the boats of the tribe, seven being captured and conveyed to Bahrein lor safe custody by the Chief. 3. Before leaving for Bahrein, Commander Pelly received a letter from the Mudir generally addressed to the officers of the British Government and to the Assistant Political Officer, claiming Zobarah as part of Turkish territory, and Shaikh Sultan and his tribe as having come under Turkish protection, pro- t cstiDg against the proceedings taken, and requesting the departure of the ship.Copies of Commander Felly's letter of proceedings of the Oth and of his two letters of the 7th to Shaikh Sultan, and of Mr. Gaskin's report of the 8th, and also translation of the Mudir's communication, forwarded therewith, are enclosed. 4. Mv view has hitherto been that Turkish connection with the situation at Zoharah should be in gored as far as'possible, and communication with Tur kish officials avoided. I have now intimated to Commander Felly in a letter despatched by the Lawrence on the 11th, of which I enclose a copy, that,, in my opinion, the claim advanced by the Mudir of the extension of Turkish protection to the Albin-Ali tribe, in their present position, cannot be admitted, and that his operations should proceed.

It was nuite impossible to admit this request and to allow you to act in defiance of the will of your Chief and the well-known wishes of the Government for several months' and the purport of your letter was accordingly reported to Govern ment. Though you must have known that the delay could not be permitted, you had taken no steps to do what was required of you up to 15 days ago. Now I have to convey to you the final and strict orders of Government to return at once with your tribe to Bahrein and your allegiance to your Chief. Know that if you fail now to obey, active measures to compel you to do so will no longer* be delayed. Be assured that these measures will be taken if you hesitate any longer to do what is required of you, and a further communi cation from me will not be necessary, as needful authority has been given to the man-of-war which will take this order to you to proceed to act as may be necessarv. In my former letter I assured you of my good offices towards your recon ciliation with your Chief, and Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali also expressed his favorable disposition towards you. Your conduct in continued resistance has not deserv ed this favor, but even now if you immediately submit yourself and return to Bahrein, my recommendation in your favor will be made to Shaikh Esa. I have hopes that you will not listen longer to the words of the evil-dis- posed persons who have misled you, and may thus escape the consequences of your rebellious conduct. No. 2-S. Z., dated Bushire, the 5tli July 1895. Prom C olonel F. A, W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— C ommander J. H. P elly , R.N., H. M. S. Sphinx. You are aware of the general position with reference to the settlement which, in defiance of the Chief of Bahrein, and in direct opposition to the policy' of Government, has been set up at Zobarah by Shaikh Sultan-bin- Mohamed Salamah, with the support, it is understood, of Shaikh Jasim-bin- Thani, and apparently the encouragement of the neig ibouring Turkish author- itv. Shaikh Sultan received a very distinct warning more than two months ago that such a settlement would not be permitted. Ue replied requesting that the demand for his evacuation of Zobarah might he postponed till the close of the pearl season, at the same time professing submission. This request was inadmissible, and I have now received the instructions of Government to the effect that strict orders are to be conveyed to Shaikh Sultan to return immediately with his tribe to Bahrein and to his allegiance to his Chief, failing which active measures will be no longer delayed. . 56 I have accordingly the honour to enclose a letter under flying seal, address ed to Shaikh Sultan, conveying the orders of Governraent, and to request the favour of your proceeding with the vessel under your command to Zobarah and causing the letter to be delivered to Shaikh Sultan in such manner as you may jud^e most expedient. You will see that Shaikh Sultan is clearly warned that in the event of his hesitation to comply with the requisition now made upon him, measures to enforce it will no longer he delayed. I have therefore to request that should Shaikh Sultan's reception of the orders and warning now addressed to him not be fully satisfactory, you will, after giving him sucii time as in your judgment may, in the circumstances, be reasonable, proceed to seize such boats belonging to him and to his tribe the Albin-Ali, as you may be in a position to capture, in order to enforce submission to the orders of Govern ment. I would also request the favour of your receiving on board your ship Mr. Gaskin, an Assistant of this Residency, who will be able to assist you with much important local information and in your communications with Shaikh Sultan and any others with whom you have to deal. Mr. Gaskin will also, I hope, prove most valuable in forwarding a reconciliation between the Bahrein Chief and Shaikh Sultan, should the latter happily be so well advised as to seek it, as he has been urged to do. I append a memorandum on minor points which I would ask you to be good enough to make available to Mr. Gaskin also, for his guidance on such points as may more especially concern his action. No more recent information has been obtained than that acquired by your visit to the place some fifteen days ago ; it is possible therefore that the posi tion may have materially changed. Should such prove to be the case, and the change be such as to give hopes that the object of Government to prevent the settlement at Zobarah is in train to be secured, I would request you to use your discretion in dealing with Shaikh Sultan under the instructions of Government above indicated and to favor me with earliest information of the facts. Memo, dated Busliire, the 5th July 1895. From— C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It would be very satisfactory that Shaikh Sultan should be summoned on board to receive the letter conveying tho orders and warning which Govern ment has directed should be given to him and the communication which Captain Pelly may have to make to him. Very possibly, however, the Shaikh may, owing to pressure from Shaikh Jasim, or even local Turkish authority, be in a position to render his compliance with such a summons difficult. In such case it would be inadvisable to summon him on board. The Porte has received a warning from Her Majesty's Government in connec tion with its interference at Zobarah, and this warning should by this time have effect on the action of its representatives near that place; it is desirable however that Turkish connection with the situation should, as far as possible, be ignored. Should the seizure of boats become necessary, the course that seems most convenient would be to make them over to the Chief of Bahrein, pending the further orders of Government. The Bahrein Chief will doubtless be able to afford means for identifying the boats belonging to the Albin-Ali tribe, against which it may be necessary to act. He may also be expected to give all the assistance in his power to convey to Bahrein any of the tribe who may be willing to return, should their own boat-transport be insufficient. The Chief has already expressed his readiness to show all possible indul gence to Shaikh Sultan and his followers, and should a disposition to submit be evinced, Mr. Gaskin should impress upon the Chief the necessity for facili tating, by any means of conciliation that may be fitting and reasonable, an amicable solution of the existinsr difficultv. O *7 The detention of the whole crews of any boats that may be seized would seem quite unnecessary ; one or two men should however be encouraged to re main in each boat, in order to secure the safety of any property left in them. Should any communication with Shaikh Jasim become necessary, he may be informed, in reply to any reference that he may make to his letter to Resident, that it was regarded as highly unsatisfactory and as not requiring reply, he being fully aware of the fixed determination of Government in regard to Zobarah. Dated H.M.S. Sphinx at Bahrein, the 9th July 1895, From— C aptain J. H. P elly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, To—C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In accordance with your memorandum dated 5th July 1895,1 have the honour to report that, having embarked Mr. Gaskin (Assistant Resident), I left liushire on tlie 5th instant and proceeded to Bahrein, arriving there on the following day. On my arrival Mr. Gaskin proceeded ashore to interview Shaikh Esa-bin- Ali, and returned in the evening accompanied by the Shaikh's brother, the Shaikh's Vizier and two Residency Agents, with whom I then proceeded to Zobarah, arriving at that place about noon on the 7th instant. I immediately sent my Interpreter ashore with a letter, requesting Shaikh Sultan to come on board to receive your letter addressed to him. To this he returned no answer, hut sent a reply to the Residency Agent, who had sent him a private note, to the effect that he was ill and could not do what was required of him. A copy of this correspondence is attached for your information. My Interpreter states that cn landing he was not allowed by Turkish soldiers to see Shaikh Sultan, but was taken to the Turkish Mudir, were he met Shaikh Sultan's son, to whom he handed my letter to be taken to his father, who was said to be suffering from dysentery and unable in consequence to see anyone. Taking into consideration that Shaikh Sultan had through the intrigue of the Turkish Mudir (who appears to have followed the son and may have inter cepted my letter) treated my letter in an insulting manner, I considered it necessary to take further steps in this matter; and to ensure his receiving your letter, together with my ultimatum as to the action to be taken in default of any reply' I requested Mr. Gaskin to land and personally deliver them to Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed Salamah. Mr. Gaskin thereupon landed, accompanied by the Residency Agent and the Shaikh's Vizier (Mr. Gaskin's report I enclose). Before daylight on the morning of the 8th the steam and pulling cutters, manned and armed, with Lieutenant Kirke in charge (Mr. Purdy, Gunner, being in charge of the st^am cutter) proceeded to seize the boats of the Albin Ali, which resulted in seven of them being taken. One of these is a Bahrein boat w r hich appears to have been detained at Zobarah by Shaikh Sultan against the wishes of the men. Ko opposition was made by any of the boats upon being seized, the crews of some of them sailing their boats off to the ship. Just before leaving Zobarah a Turkish official visited the ship, bringing with him the letter which I enclose, and to which I made no reply. I left Zobarah at 11 a. m., on the 8th instant with the captured boats in tow and arrived at Bahrein in the evening. These boats are being turned over to the Chief of Bahrein for safe custody. With reference to the letter received from the Turkish Mudir, I shall re main here pending a further communication from you. I have found Mr. Gaskin a great assistance during these proceedings.

This is to inform you that I am the bearer of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to your address, and to request that you will8 come on board the vessel under my command to receive it, and after reading the same to aive me your reply. I will assure you your safe return to Zobarah. Dated H, M. S. Sphinx at Zobarah, the 7tli July 1895. From—C aptain J. 11. P elly , CommanJer and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, To— Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed-bin-Salamah. In consideration of the insulting manner in which you have received my letter to you, requesting you to visit me, I can but consider that you intend setting at defiance the orders of the British Government. I now forward you by Mr. Gaskin (Assistant Resident) the letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and if no answer is received from you within 6 hours of the receipt thereof, I shall commence active measures against you ordered by Government. Translation of Mohamed Rahim's letter to Sultan-bin-Salamah. I beu to say that I have arrived at this place with Shaikh Khalid-bin-Ali Al-Khalifiah and Shaikh Abdul Rahman-bin-Wahab on board man-of-war, and we wish to see you on board and I hope you will call on us. There is a letter from the Commander of the ship for you, and we are anxious to see you and whatever you want will be done after seeing you, and also please bring your advisers with you to have the interview in their presence without delay. I will not further trouble you. Convey my best compliments to friends from our side. The Shaikhs wish to be remembered to you and also my son Khalil. P.

After compliments. —I noted whatever you have written to me. Regard ing my visit on board, I am unable to do so under any circumstances, and also you ought to know that you have nothing to do to such extent. p rom —The Mudir of Ojatr , Agent to Mudir of Zobarah, To—Those Officers of the British Government and also the Assistant who may see this. Should you enquire especially concerning those persons composing the Albin-Ali (namely) Sultan-bin-Mohamed Salamah and his following, small or great, their residence is in the locality of Zobarah, which is (part) of the territories of the Turkish Government under the jurisdiction of Katr and the property of the Sultan, who is our Sultan, and the foresaid tribe have come under the protection of the (Ottoman) Government. It {i .e., the foregoing statement) should be known, and they {i .e., Albin-Ali) should experience no injustice at your hands. I am Seyed Mohamed Raouf, Mudir of Ojair and Agent of the Mudir of Zobarah. Above me (there is) a Kaim Makam, above whom there exists a Mutasarrif (named) Ibrahim Foozi Pasha. It is necessary for me to furnish information; if, therefore, you entertain any action, inform me that I may place the information before the Kaim Makam and the Mutasarrif. This (your action) is not in accordance with the customs of Governments which have formed laws and policies, and you have acted in opposition to (international) laws and policies.I am sending you Corporal Haji Abdullah, and my desire is that you ghould inform me of your reasons and intentions. If you are desirous of obtaining; replies, it is not necessary to come in a man-of-war and enter (the waters of) Zobarah. Zobarah is a part of Katr and is the property of the Turkish Government and our Sultan Abdul Hamad Khan. If you desire to seize Sultan-bin-Mohamed and take him on board, you have no right to do so, and regarding your contention in that the Albin-Ali are subjects'to Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali, I have true information that they are of the inhabitants of Katr from ancient days, from grandfather to son. Your vessel should not remain in the harbour of Zobarah .and, may it please God, that on the receipt of my letter to you, you will depart. I shall refer to my Government and you should refer to yours. You have taken those vessels which were in the harbour, in some of which there are (some) pearls, shells, etc. I do not understand your desires {i .e., actions), and this is contrary to (all) laws and usages ; and if you have any reason for the same, negotiate with me and receive my reply and prevent your commit ting these injustices. If any of them {i.e.) boats) disappear and anything lost therefrom, you are answerable. At present Sultan is sick and is unable to send you a reply; let this be your reply. You have no right to act contrary to custom, and on your receiving this letter you should inform me what are your intentions. Dated Zobarah, the 8th July 1895. p rom j. C. Gaskin , Esq, Extra Assistant to the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf, To— Captain J. H. Pelly, R .N., H. M. S. Sphinx. I have the honour to report that in compliance with your request I pro ceeded to Zobarah, taking with me the Residency Agent of Bahrein and Abdul Rahman -bin-Abdul Wahab, Vizier to the Chief of Bahrein, and beg to give, in detail, all that took place on that occasion. On our arrival at the town of Zobarah I ordered your Interpreter to go and ascertain the locality of Shaikh Sultan-bin -Mahomed-bin-Salamah's residence, and to inform Shaikh Sultan to the effect that I was the bearer of a letter from you, which I desired to deliver to him personally. When the Interpreter landed he was met by two Turkish soldiers, one of whom is a Corporal in that service. They prevented the Interpreter to hold any communication with the natives, and told him that Shaikh Sultan^was in a state unfit to receive any one, and Shaikh Sultan s son, together ^ ith Khalifah bin-Mubarak, one of the headmen of the Albm-Ali, were with the 1 urkish- Mudir; he therefore must go to the Mudir's quarters if he desired to meet them. Anticipating that some unnecessary delay may be caused by the intrigue of the Mudir, we landed and went direct to the hut in which Shaikh Sultan receives visitors. On the way there we were met by the two soldiers, who informed us that the Mudir desired us to go to him as we had no business to interview any one prior to visiting him and informing him of the cause of our presence in Zobarah. I requested the Corporal to convey my _ compliments to the Mudir and inform him that as his presence in Zobarah is not recognised, there was no necessity of my calling upon him I also ordered the Interpreter to go to the Mudir's quarters and inform Shaikh Sultan's son that I desired him to come to me. The Interpreter, finding only Khalifab -bin-Muharak with the Mudir, con veyed my message to him, with which message Khahfah -bin-Mubarak com- plied. gI informed Khalifah-bin-Mubarak that there was an urgent necessity for my seeing Shaikh Sultan -hin-Mahomed-bin-Salamah with as little delay as possible, and if he was too ill to leave his bed, I would be glad to go to him. After a delay of nearly half an hour, I requested the Residency Agent to proceed to Shaikh Sultan's residence, which was only a few yards oft', with the same message, and after his having gone a few paces in that direction he was promptly stopped by the two soldiers and ordered not to proceed another step. I got up to go to Shaikh Sultan's house, and on nearing the soldiers was in a like manner stopped, and on insisting to proceed, they seized me by the arms and informed me that the Mutasarrif had given orders to the elfect that no one should see Shaikh Sultan. I therefore must not attempt to act contrary to the orders of the Turkish Government. I told them that I could not recognise those orders and must obey mine at any cost; they therefore had better make way. They however would not listen and attempted to force me back, where upon I drew out my whistle for the purpose of calling for assistance. The soldiers quickly interpreted my action and released me before I could whistle, and the Corporal went to give information to the Mudir, whilst the other stood aside. It appeared to me that the Mudir would recognise my determination to fulfil my orders at any cost, and it was likely that he would place no further obstacles. I therefore thought it fit to wait a little before making another attempt which might lead to some undesirable results. On the Mudir receiving the Corporal's story, he came out and asked the second soldier why he had been making such a row and forthwith despatched the Corporal to Shaikh Sultan's house. Shortly after this occurrence Shaikh Sultan and Khalifah-bin-Mubarak appeared, and I told the former that as I wished to see him privately, I desired the absence of the Mudir; and in compliance with the same he requested the Mudir to retire. After the retirement of the Mudir T personally delivered your letter to gether with that from Colonel Wilson to Shaikh Sultan, informing him that I sincerely hoped he would show his good sense by giving agreeable replies to both letters. Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed-bin-Salamah read the two letters in my pre sence, and their contents caused him to behave in a manner contrary to his usual habits, and he talked hig, stating that he was no slave or subject to Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali, and though he could not contend against the power of the British Government, no force or action on their part would compel him to return to Bahrein; that both he and Shaikh Jasim-bin-Mahomed-bin-Thani had a few days previously written to Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali on this subject, and private negotiations were more likely to lead to their conciliation than threats from the British Government, with whom he has nothing to do. The Mudir here returned and Shaikh Sultan became more offensive, threatening both the Residency Agent and the Vizier, adding that they were the cause ot his misfortune and trouble with the British Government. He then turned round on me and told me that if the man-of-war was to wait for a month, he would not send replies to the two letters : I therefore had better not wait any longer. Seeing further negotiations of no avail, and Shaikh Sultan being disposed to set the orders of the British Government at defiance, and disregard your letter, I thought it fit not to prolong my visit beyond this and returned to II. M. S. Sphinx, I may add that when Sheikh Sultan made an appearance, he was not in the condition as reported by the Turkish soldiers to the Interpreter. No. 3—S.Z., dated Bushire, the lOth July 1895.

I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 9th and to state that your proceedings in carrying out the objects of Government appear to have been very satisfactory. 10With reference to the letter from the Turkish Mudir at Zobarah, protesting against your proceedings and intimating that the Albin-Ali tribe lias come under the protection of the Turkish Government, I am of opinion that, under the tenour of the instructions of Government, this claim is inadmissible and should not be admitted by you. I have accordingly to request that, failing compliance with the orders which have been conveyed to Shaikh Sultan, you will proceed to seize the boats of the tribe which in your former letter were supposed to be in a situation rendering the operation feasible, to such extent as you may judge to be expedient. I am requesting the Commander of R. I. M. S. Lawrence to give you such assistance with boats, and in the conveyance of craft, that you may seize, as you may require.

Inform Mudir, Zobarah, that Turkish claims to Bahrein totally inadmissible, and if Jasim or other venture any attempt against Bahrein he must take the consequences. Telegram No. 1513-E., dated Simla, the 4tli August 1895. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—The Secretary of State, London. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reports by telegram dated 2nd August 1895 that the Mudir at Zobarah claims the Albin-Ali as Turkish sub- jects settled there by order of the Mutasarrif of Hasa, and declares that Bahrein is under Katr and forms part of the Ottoman dominions. Jasim is said to be collecting boats and followers. I am instructing the Resident to inform the Mudir that Turkish claims to Bahrein are totally inadmissible, and any one making an attempt against Bahrein must take the consequences. I recommend a strong remonstrance to the Porte against the proceedings of their local officials^on the Katr coast, over which we admit no Turkish jurisdiction. Please see Lord Kimberley's Secret Despatch No. 35, dated 8th September 1893, and the correspondence forwarded with the letter No. 27, dated 27th January 1893, from Sir Steuart Bayley. 1/ No. 75, dated Bushire, the ii7th July 1895. From —CoLGNEL F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. Letter from Shaikh Jasim, dated 10th July 1895. Jq continuation of my telegram of 1895^ f,0m Commander ' dated 14th Ju,y the 24th instant, I have the honour to Letter from Commander, forward, for the information of Govern- Trtu* from (W.nd.r, spM...d.ud 23rd July ment, copy of the correspondence cited in 1895, with enclosures. the margin. 2. I can hardly believe it possible that such an attack as Commander Pelly conceives might be brought about by Shaikh Jasim on Bahrein should be at tempted. Having regard to the intimate part which has been openly taken by the local Turkish authorities in the affairs of Albin-Ali, such an attack would seem to involve full Turkish responsibility for an overt act of hostility w 7 hich can scarcely be apprehended. 3. The capture of nine more of the Albin-Ali boats reported to have been effected on 15th July seemed to offer a prospect of some result. Salim-bin- Hamad, who was in one of these boats, was after arrival at Bahrein reconciled with the Chief, and appeared to welcome the opportunity of a return to his for mer position. Boats provided by the Bahrein Chief were accordingly sent to Zobarah to bring over the family and followers of Salim, w 7 ho holds a high place in the Albin-Ali tribe, and such others as might be willing to return. One of these boats returned at once, reporting that the rest, nine in number, had been de tained by the newly-appointed Turkish Mudir. This action by, or directly in the presence and with the countenance of, the local Turkish authority, makes the situation more serious, and I would request that I may be favoured with the instructions of Government upon it. 4. Besides Shaikh Jasim's letter of the 10th July to me, which has not been answered, he has written several to the Bahrein Chief. They are full of13 conventional verbiage and are in my opinion not worthy of any confidence. His statement in the letter to me that Mr. Gaskin bad drawn a pistol upon Shaikh Sultan on the 7fch July is a deliberate falsehood. In a subsequent letter to the Chief he took a different tone, excusing Shaikh Sultan for not having received the visit in a proper manner, and saying that he had censured him for it, thou Mi 'no blame can be attached to a man whose mind has been affected by illness.' Altogether in Shaikh Jasim's letter there is a somewhat unintelli gible mixture of protest, profession, and appeal. After writing the above I have received your telesrpm of this day, in timating that Lawrence should be sent to obtain further information. Dated the 17tli Moharrum 1313 —10th July 1895. From —Jasim bin-Mohambd Thani, to Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After compliments. —When I learnt the news of the arrival of the man-of- war, and knowing that Sultan (bin-Mohamed Salamah) was ill, I started with the obiect of meeting the Captain, the Assistant and Khalid (bin-Ali). I had scarcely reached Zobarah when I learnt that they had suddenly landed there and frightened the people of the country by (a demonstration of) armed boats, and that the Assistant had landed with a drawn revolver at Sultan (bin-Mohamed Salamah); but they (Sultan and his people would appear to be meant) avoided them by good means. Afterwards they (armed boats) disturbed the (peace of the) sea and seized the boats belonging to the poor and humble striving to earn their livelihood, together with the unopened oyster shells they had on board and all their property. The Albin-Ali tribe did not leave Bahrein, but on account of the humili ation which they experienced : they have not been rebels. I stood guarantee for them to Shaikh Esa (assuring him) that no mischief would arise from the side of Zobarah or from its inhabitants, and they have committed no offence. They are poor who earn their livelihood : they are not slaves. Their original domicile was Katr and they resided in lareybah and Zobarah, and thence removed to Hawaylah and El-13idaa. Ihey have not been ruled as slaves. This proceeding (which has been undertaken against them) is contrary to your (sense of) justice, and is a wrong unbecoming of you. They have no knowledge of their own affairs : these are known to God and then to me. Dated Ras Lufan, the 14th July 1895. / From— C aptain J. H. P elly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, to— C oloxel F. W. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 10th instant, received per R.I.M.S Lawrence on the forenoon of the 12th, and to thank you for placing that ship at my disposal for a time. In compliance with your letter I left Bahrein at 8 a..m. on the 13th, K.I.M.S. Lawrence in company, and proceeded to Zobarah, anchoring off that place at 2 p.m . the same day. I found all the boats, about M in number, hauled up on the beach, and therefore did not think it expedient to attempt their seizure. During my stay at Zobarah I received two letters from Jasim -bin-Mohamed Thani, asking for an interview on behalf of Shaikh Sultan who was sick, to both of which I replied stating that he could come off to the ship if he desired to see me. This, however, he would not do. A copy of this correspondence is attached.14. c I am also forwarding 1 you a letter, under flying seal, received through the Bahrein Hesident Aiient from the same source, which has been duly translated hy Mr. Gaskin, and from the lone of which it would appear that Jasini-bin- Thaui intends to support the Albin-Ali against whatever proceedings nuiy he taken in their coercion. According to news received from a messenger from Roweis, Jasim advises that the pearling iieet should proceed to the banks off El-Bidda. This messenger also stated that Jasim has sent a letter to the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa, reporting my proceedings. From a letter received from Ja^im, Shaikh Fsa-hin-Ali is of opinion that he may agitate the Beni-Hajar tribes to make an attack on Bahrein Island. While off Zobarah several Bedouin tents and camels were seen, which were not there on our first visit. These appear to be the levies sent by Jasim- bin-Mohamed Thani to help the Albin-Ali. Uearing nothing further from Jasim-bin-Thani, I left Zobarah at 8 a. m. this morning, Lawrence in company, and proceeded round the Katr Penin sula as far as Eas Lufan. We passed two small batches of boats, which proved to be boats belonging to subjects of Shaikh Esa, and also two larger batches which we stopped to inspect, and which also turned out to be Bahrein's boats. I could gather no information from either of these boats as to the place where the boats of the Albin-Ali are pearl-diving. I am anchored off Has Lufan for the night and shall proceed in the morning down the coast in search of the Albin-Ali boats. My intention is, if possible, to be at Bahrein on Tuesday evening or Wed nesday morning. Dated Bahrein, the 17tli July 1895. From— Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To— Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that on the 15th instant, I came upon a number of boats engaged in pearl-diving, nine of which were boats of the Albin- Ali, which I seized and towed to Bahrein, turning them over to the Chief of Bahrein as before. In one of them was Salim-bin-Hamad, the originator of this disturbance, and it is hoped that a reconciliation may now be arrived at between him and the Bahrein Chief. Dated Bahrein, the 23rd July 1895. From— Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To— Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With respect to the further situation of affairs here I have the honour to report as follows— On the morning of the 20th Mr. Gaskin reported tome that Khalifah-bin- Jasim, son of Jasim-bin-Thani, had arrived at Bahrein, bearing a letter from his father to Sheikh Esa to the effect that he (Jasim) would be responsible for the evacuation of Zobarah by Shaikh Sultan within 12 to 15 days, also that the tribe should be allowed to return. Kluilifa-bin-Jasim also requested an inter view with Mr. Gaskin, which was granted. I requested Mr. Gaskin to inform him, for the information of his father, that if a letter from Shaikh Sultan pro mising his return with his following to Bahrein within 12 days is received within four days, the matter will be considered; but if no answer is forthcom ing within that time, further action will be at once taken against those of the Albin-Ali who continue to disobey the orders of Government. I gave permission for Sheikh Esa to send back to Zobarah Salim-bin- Hamad and people taken in boats, that they may bring their families to Bahrein. Amicable arrangement has been arrived at between Sheikh Esa and Salim-bin-IIamad.On tlie evomns* of the 21st Sliaikli Esa despatched 5 boats to Zoharah, and another 5 yesterday morning, for the purpose of conveying Salim's family and such of his followers who may decide to return to their homes at Bahrein, and yesterday evening intelligence was received here respecting the detention of nine of these boats at Zob irah by Mahomed Effendi, the newly-appointed Mudir at that place ; also that the tribesmen have been warned by him against returning to Bahrein. With reference to this T am sending him a letter demanding an explana tion, a copy of which I enclose. It is also stated that Ibrahim Eoosi Pasha, the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa, is collectini? levies, but for what purpose is vet unknown, and that he has in structed Jasim-bin-Thani to send reinforcements to Zobarah. A letter has been received by a Banyan from Katif to the effect that it has been suggested by Mahomed Abdul Wahab to the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa that he should prohibit the landing of British subjects there, as they are suspected of being there for the purpose of spying upon their movements. It is reported that the Turkish gunboat ZahaJ arrived at Katif on the 2lst with the newly-appointed Kaiin Makam of that place on board; her future movements are unknown. Seeing all the difficulties in the way, I consider that it would be advisable to telegraph for another man-of-war to be sent up the Gulf for the protection of Bahrein in case of attack. As matters stand at present, I deem it necessary that I should remain handy to Bahrein, and consider that your presence here is highly desirable. Dafpd Bahrain, the 23rd July 1895- From— C aptain J. H. P elly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To—M ahomed Effkndi at Zobarah. Hearing that you are detaining nine boats belonging to the Shaikh of Bahrein, who is on friendly terms with the British Government, and Zobarah being one of the towns belonging to him, also the Albin-Ali being his subjects, I demand that you will inform me by what authority you are detaining these Bahrein boats which were sent to Zobarah for the purpose of conveying those of the Albin-Ali who desire to return to Bahrein and to their allegiance to their Chief. No Turkish authority is recognised by the British Government at Zobarah. Enclosure in letter No. 37 of the 12th July 1395, frrm the Secretary, Political and Secret iJepartment, India Office.

On the receipt of Your Lordship's despatch No. 206 of the 30th ultimo, I lost no time in informing the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the rumoured intention of the Albin-Ali tribe to form a settlement at Zobarah on the Persian Gulf with the support of the Turkish Mutasarrif of Hasa. I caused it to be poined out to His Excellency, who appeared to have no knowledge of the question, that the position of Great Britain with regard to Bahrein was perfectly well known to the Porte, and referred him to the Embassy's note verhale, of which a copy was forwarded to the Foreign Office in Sir C. Ford's No. 318 of 15th November 1892. An aide-memoire on the subject was left with His Excellency. Telegram dated Simla, the 9tli August 1S95.

Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. 'With reference to your telegram of 27th July, and in continuation of my telegram of yesterday 's'date, I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, that I despatched the R. I. M. S. Lawrence to Bahrein on the 28th July to obtain the further information desired regarding the apprehension of an attack on Bahrein, for which some grounds had been indicated in reports which had reached me. 1 enclose copy of Commander Felly's report of the 30th July, and of its enclosures 2 The information now available does not lead me to modify the opinion expressed in my letter No. 75 of the 27th July, and I do not regard an attack on Bahrein as at present probable. The rumoured collection of levies by the Mutasarrif of El-llasa can hardly be taken, in ray opinion, to imply a threat of overt hostilitv, and the same may be said of Shaikh Jasim's reported prepara tion^ as in ail the circumstances of the case his act would be tantamount to the direct action of the Turkish authorities. The local representatives of Tur kish authority are, however, described as an irresponsible class of officials on ■whose discretion no reliance can be placed. 3 It will be seen that Syed llaouf Effendi, acting for the Mudir of Zobarah, does not, in his reply, directly meet Commander Felly's demand for an explana tion of the detention of the Bahrein boats on the 22nd July. His letter, however, amounts to an acceptance of responsibility for the act, and my information is that the boats were boarded by Turkish soldiers, the sails and gear being removed. 4. It has already been reported that Salim-bin-Hamad, after reaching \ Bahrein with the boats captured on the loth July, was readily reconciled with , the Bahrein Chief, mutual engagements being executed. Salim is a relative of the late Esa-bin-Tarif, head of the Albin-Ali tribe, who died about a year and a half a^o The Residency Agent reports that the Chief has now appointed him in succession to the late head of the tribe, and that the appointment will be welcomed by the tribe, who will prefer him to Saikh Sultan. Salim has begged that his boats may be allowed to go pearling, so that he and his immediate followers may be spared the loss caused by the stoppage of these operations I am authorizing the grant of his request, considering this to be a just as well as a politic measure. 5. The Turkish corvette or gunboat Zuhaf, reported as having arrived at Katif with reliefs on the 21st July, is now stated to be at Zobarah. 1 regret to report the receipt of an intimation of the death on 27th July, from heat appolexy, of Chief Engineer J. N. Midgeby of H. M. S. Sphinx, Dated Bahrein, the 3Uth July 1895. j / From Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In accordance with your letters Nos. 53 and 397, dated 27th instant, I have the honour to acquaint you as follows :— The latest intelligence received by the Chief of Bahrein is to the effect that Jasim -bin-Mahomed-Thani has issued orders to all the Albm-Ah pearl ing fleet to return to Zobarah, and he has also ordered the launching of all the available boats that are at Zobarah. He has issued orders to his following and to Nasir-bin-Mubarak to be present at Zobarah.17 Threatening letters have also been received by Shaikh Esa and his son from Jasira, showing his animosity towards him. These letters are being forwarded to you by the Agent of this place. I also enclose the reply to my letter to the Turkish official at Zobarah, from the tenour of which it appears that the Albin-Ali are receiving every support from the Turks. The Shaikh of the Naim tribe at Bahrein has received a letter from Jasim, demanding that he should either leave Bahrein with his following for Katr or send boats to convey all the cattle he has at Katr back to Bahrein. The Turkish gun vessel Zuhaf is now at Zobarah. It has also been reported to me that an atrocious and daring act of piracy and attempted murder of a British Indian subject has taken place about 6 miles below Katif within sight of the shore on the 26th instant about 9 a.m. The perpetrator of this outrage is a Bedouin by name Ahmad-bin-Salman, cousin to Nasir-bin-Mubarak. The victim, a banyan, had his right hand cut com pletely off from the wrist. The doctor's report upon him to me I enclose. I shall most probably leave here to-morrow or Thursday for a cruise round the coast. Translation of letter received from Sayid Mahomed Raonf Effendi f Mudir of Ojair and Agent of the Mudir of Zobarah), to Commander Felly, II. M. S. 11 Sphinx,' dated the 26th July 1895. Your letter dated 23rd July 1895 received, and I have understood what you have w r ritten. 'With reference to the nine boats that you sent to convey the families of those of the inhabitants of Zobarah, whom you have captured by force from under the flag of the Commander of the Faithful and Sultan of the Unitarians, the said families are the subjects of the High Government from ancient days and for ever, and they only settled at Zobarah by the orders of the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa. Both you and Mr. Gaskin have committed injustices beyond rules and friendship in taking boats belonging to the people of Zobarah, goods being in them to the value of 5 lakhs of dollars, and the owners firstly under the protec tion of God and secondly under the High Ottoman Government. You have also prevented them from following their occupation. So far you have caused loss to all boats belonging to the people of Katr which have reached your side. Also you have seized the boats which you have found belonging to the people of Zobarah, though they have not sinned ; and no one has any claims against them except that they have come under the shadow of the Commander of the Faithful and the protection of the High Ottoman Government. Let it not be hidden from you that Bahrein is under Katr, also Katr and Bahrein are part of the domains of the High (Ottoman) Government. The origi nal persons who took Bahrein from its people were of the inhabitants of Katr. Al-Khalifah were merchants from Koweit and strangers to them. They were only four persons and were appointed Agent over Bahrein; also paid tithes and taxes to Katr and to Bin-Saood, the Sultan's officer. Differences arose between them and Bahrein. Then flew the flag of the High Ottoman Government. You falsely represented (matters) to the high Government in support of your claim of protection over them. This not satisfying you, you have exercised false aggression towards the people of Katr, taking all their boats and goods, also imprisoning (some of) their people, though they are under the protection of God and that of the Commander of the Faithful, the successor to the prophet of God of the world. You have committed all these great actions against them. It is evident from 'what is known that the Commander of the Faithful will directly over throw your authority in Bahrein, and support her against you and others.Dated Balirein, the SL9tli July 1895. From— Surqeox F. Bradshaw, To—The Commander, H. M. S. Sphinx. I have the honour to submit to you the following report of the injuries sustained by the Banyan named Tikchand Dewairgados. His right hand was completely severed above the wrist, exposing both bones of the forearm, and he had a large incised wound extending from the lower angle of the scapula across the back of the shoulder, terminating about the junction of middle and upper third of the arm : this wound is about 1 inch deep. There is also a smaller wound on the back about 8 inches long and \ inch deep. When I visited him he was very much exhausted from the shock and loss of hemorrhage; and as no attempt had been made to dress the wounds, there was extensive suppuration from them, especially from the sword cuts in the shoulder. I amputated the forearm a little above the lower third. Consi dering the shock and loss of blood and the extensive suppuration from the sword wounds, I think he is in a very critical condition.

W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the 'Government of India, Foreign Department. 'I have the honour to report, for the information of the Government of India, that the intimation and warning conveyed in your confidential teleo-ram of the 4th instant, have been communicated to the Turkish representative at Zobarah, through the Commander of E.M.S. 'Sphinx.' 2. From Commander Felly's report of the 6th instant, of which I enclose a copy, it will be seen that the Turkish assumption of control of the situation and intervention in the affairs of the Albin-Ali, have become very pronounced! It would appear that the Turkish flag has been given to the Zobarah boats and 20thr\t their movements are controlled. I undersfand that Commander Pelly has some doubt of the efficacy of further proceedings against the Albin-Ali, ovvin^ to the Turks having taken matters into their own hands. In my 0 [)inion, however, the hoisting of the Turkish flag on a boat of that tribe, need in no way be held to demand a recognition that such boat is rightfully under the protection of that Government, or to bar a seizure. Meantime the nine boats sent from Bahrein for the conveyance to that place from Zobarah, of the family and followers of Shaikh Salim-bin-Hamad, remain in detention at Zobarah. It is desirable, I venture to submit, that these should be forcibly recovered, failing compliance with a demand for their release. .Commander Pelly has not, however, stated that he has information whether the boats are in a position to be readily recovered and may nat be prepared to undertake the operation with the means at his disposal. 3. I would request special reference to the report that 11.M.S. Sphinx will very shortly require coal, and that it will be necessary for her to return to Bushire to obtain it about the 20th instant. Though service at the present moment in these seas, is, and brobably will be, for at least four weeks to come, a very severe trial for a European crew, I would hesitate to recom mend even a temporary withdrawal of all protection, and the means of enfor- cin'' our authority, from Bahrein at the present juncture. Information has constantly reached me that extreme uneasiness and alarm prevail among the inhabitants, and that people have in consequence left the place. While con- sidering therefore, as I have already reported, that in all the present circum- stances %n attack is not seriously to be apprehended, it would, in my opinion, be imprudent, having regard to the state of local feeling, to leave the place without the support ot' a visible evidence of our power. I would accordingly submit, for the consideration of Government, that another war vessel should be sent. 4. I have been unable to get any information of a second Turkish gun boat bavins; been sent to Zobarah as mentioned by Cammander Pelly. I hardly think it possible that there should be a seoond vessel, unless such should have come from some place beyond the Gulf. Dated Bahrein, the 6th August 1895, p rorn —Captain J. H. Telly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, ^ To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. I have the honuor to inform you that I left this port on the 31st July and proceeded to Zobarah arriving there the same day. The Turkish gun-vessel Zuhaf was there on our arrival, and the Captain informed me that his orders were to await the arrival of the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa, whom he expected daily, and in the meantime to keep off any threatened attack on Bahrein. He also said that his spies had reported to him that there were 14,000 men armed with Martini -Henry rifles about four hours' walk inland. A Bahreini who swam off to the ship at Zobarah, stated that Jassim had with him just outside Zobarah about 50 of his following and that the report about the 14,000 men was incorrect. I left Zobarah on the morning of the 2nd instant, and proceeded to the pearl- banks off lias Lufan and upon nearing a batch of boats, several of them made for the shore, and as it was blowing fresh and 1 was unable to overtake them, I fired a blank charge and in response one of them hoisted Turkish colors. There is no doubt from the evidence of the natives on board at the time that these boats belong to Zobarah, and this coincides with the report I heard that all Zobarah boats have been supplied with a Turkish flag. The Zuhnf visited boats at Fasht-al Debel on Saturday, and asked whether there were any Bahrein boats there, and upon being informed there were none, they ordered the Zobarah boats not to leave that position for three days, when they would be further communicated with. I have forwarded the reply to the Turkish Mudirof Zobarah, in accordance with your memorandum dated 214tli instant. Ifc is reported that another Turkish gun-hoat has arrived at Zoharah. I shall shortly be requiring coal, and it will be necessary for me to procet-d to Bushire in about 1-1 days' time for this purpose. Tplegram No. 1630-E., dated Simla, the 26th August 1895.

With reference to Your Lordship's telegram of the 20th August, we have issued the necessary instructions and the Piyeon has gone to the spot.

As you do not entertain serious apprehen- sion of attack on Bahrein, it is not intended to send troops unless you report further that movement of Turks in that direction is really imminent. A Native battalion could probably arrive at spot in ten days. Meanwhile troops will be held in readness. Telegram, dated Bushire, the 26th August 1S95.

In continuation of my telegram of yesterday, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of Commander Pellv's report of the 14th instant and enclosure. 2. 1 have previously expressed the view that notwithstanding the very disturbing rumours that have been rife, a serious attack on Bahrein could From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. No. 80, dated Bushire, the 17th August 1895. From— Colonel F. A. ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,23 hardly be believed to be possible, my main reason for this opinion being that such an attack must be held to involve nothing 1 short of the fullest responsibi lity of the Turkish Government. It has, however, been urged by Mr. Gaskin, Extra Assistant Resident, who went to Bahrein with H. M. S. Sphinx last month, and has since remained there, that having regard to attempts by Jasim to tamper with the loyalty of some of Shaikh Esa's people, a destructive outbreak might be brought about. This could be effected, it is urged, by a comparatively small party of Jasim's people, or of the wilder Bedouin element inliuenced by him, which being joined by some of those on the Inland on landing, might work considerable mischief, Jasim meantime counting on escaping responsibility by throwing the blame on Shaikh Esa's own people. 3. Yesterday I had the opportunity of closely questioning Agha Mohamed Rahim, who had just arrived by the mail, having attended Air. Gaskin on the spot for more than a month past, and who having long served us as Residency Agent at Bahrein, is familiar with the surrounding people and local feeling, lie regards Jasim—ostensibly holding the important office of Kaim Makam of Katr under the Ottoman Government—as an utterly unscrupulous, reckless, and irresponsible character with an unlimited faculty for intrigue. He holds the tirmest conviction that Jasim is at heart thoroughly inimical to Turkish authority, and declares the secret aim and object of that /estless adventurer to be a rupture between Great Britain and the Porte, whh the result of a severe blow to the prestige of the latter in these parts. Jasim would thereupon throw off his very uncertain allegiance to the Ottoman Government, and openly defying its authority, as he did some three years ago, when he inflicted a serious reverse on a Turkish force, would make common cause with the Ruler of Nejd, and trust to making his peace with us by plausible excuses and sub mission. An obvious difficulty as regards the above views at once suggests itself, that the Turkish authorities would hardly lend themselves so readily and com pletely as their recent action implies, to such designs of Jasim. To this Agha Mohamed Rahim replies that the Porte is profoundly ignorant of the actual facts and true situation as regards a remote part of its territory, and is most ill- served by its local officers, who supply the most false and self-interested information. 4. In the above premises there is, in my opinion, much truth, certainly so with regard to the character attributed to Ja^im, and the ignorance and weak ness of the Ottoman Government in these parts. But upon the conclusion, attri buting a definite and somewhat complex design to Jasim, it is not possible without further evidence to form an opinion. It does not however seem necessary to fathom the true projects of Jasim in the very active intrigues to which he has committed himself : it will suffice to recognise the fact that lie is perfectly unscrupulous and reckless of responsibility, and thus some colour is given to the constant rumours and universal fears of an attack on Bahrein which might otherwise be lightly regarded. The balance of probability is still, in my opinion, against such an attempt, but the very general alarm prevailing—our subjects being reported as carrying their valuables for safety to the Agency—is in itself mischievous, and I have accordingly thought it right to urge the desirability of the presence of another man-of-war. 5. In my telegram of yesterday I have also ventured to recommend the adoption of stronger measures, and in this connection I enclose a translation of the Bahrein Chief's letter to me concerning the seizure and detention of his boats sent to Zobarah to bring over the family and followers of Shaikh Salim-bin-Hamad, who had made his peace with Shaikh Esa, This incident was most unfortunate as encouraging resistance and strengthening the influence for mischief of Jasim. 1 would suggest therefore, as a first step, that should another man-of-war be sent up, these boats should be forcibly recovered after despatch of an ultimatum, subject to the opinion of the Senior Naval Officer on the practicability of the operation. And with regard to doubts which, I understand. Commander Pelly lias as to the warrant tor the seizure of Albin-Ali boats, now wearing the Turkish flag, it appears to mc that the recent grant of the flag, by possibly irresponsible localauthorities, should not bar the operations which had previously been under taken. 6. I would request the favour of instructions upon Commander Felly's enquiry as to his discretion in firing upon a fleet of boats apparently hostile, though under Turkish colours, to which I referred in my telegram of yesterday. And in this connection 1 would report that a request ot' Shaikh l^sa lor per mission to equip a boat to follow up the perpetrator of the two cases o£ piracy that have been reported has been refused, to avoid giving any sort of excuse for acts of violence by native craft. It is alleged, however, that Ahmad-bin- Salman who committed the two acts of piracy has Turkish countenance, in his proceedings. Dated Bahrein, the l4tb August 1895. from— C aptain J. II. P elly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gul£ Division, To—C olonki. F. A. 'W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my letter dated 8th instant, I have the honour to further inform you as follows : — Intelligence has been received that on Thursday last a pearling boat bc- longing to Shaikh BBa was captured by the pirate Ahmad-bin-Salman on the west side of Fasht-al-Debel. A copy of my letter sent to the Commander of the Zuhaf reporting this matter I enclose for your information. News has also been received to the effect that two days after the receipt of a reply to the IMutasarrifs telegram to Constantinople with reference to Zobarah affairs, he collected a large following of Arabs and Turkish troops at a well named Bt-er Nejim, situated outside El-lTasa, and has given out that be intends going to Nejd, but I consider this doubtful as the nearest water-supply there is seven days' journey. Several of Jasim's boats are collected off TTakrah and messenger boats are calling in all the Katr boats to the same place. A messenger boat has also been despatched by Jasim to call in the Albin-Ali boats. It seems to be the general opinion here that Jasim is now determined to make the attack, and in anticipation of this Shaikh Esa is calling in his pearling fleet. I request to be informed whether, in the event of my meeting at sea a fleet of boats apparentlv hostile sailing under Turkish colours, I am authorised in firing on the same'without or within the three mile limit of the Katr coasts. I consider that another man-of-war is urgently needed here ; for if an attack is made under the direction of the Turks, I fear that the island will be taken on account of an insufficient garrison, another great weakness being the unsurveyed state of the south side of the island, thus preventing ships from having free action in those waters. Do you not under the circumstances consider that it would be advisable to have a small force of troops here for the protection of Bahrein and British prestige ? In case of my not beins: able to cral shortly, I should'propose that the Lawrence should be sent over to supply me. The boat that conveyed my letter to Zobarah has not yet returned. I am therefore proceeding to Zobaraii to-morrow morning and shall probably anchor there for the night. Dated Bahrein, the 12th August 1895. rrom— C aptain J. H.

V Information has reached me that an act of piracy has taken place on the west side of Fasht-al-Debel on Thursday evening last in the seizure of a 24Bahrein pparlinj* boat by Ahmad-bin-Salman, the same person wbo cut off the hand of a British Indian subject on the 26th July. It appears that he went alongside the pearling boat in a small boat with four men and threatened to kill any who offered resistance to him. He took pos session of the boat, turning its crew into the small boat and sailed the boat with all its contents towards the mainland. This man having taken refuge in territory under Turkish authority, I have the honour to request that he may be brought to justice for both these offences, and that the boat and contents be returned to the owner and compen sation made. I am reporting this serious act of piracy to the Home Government, and it is hoped that you will be able to suppress further aggressions of this kind. Dated 5th August 1895. From— Shaikh Esa , Chief of Bahrein, To—The Polaical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. After Compliments. —Let it not be hidden from you that on their arrival at Bahrein, Salim-bin-Hamad and his followers begged for protection and promised to bring their families and effects to Bahrein. In addition to the protection, assurances and honour were bestowed upon them. After this the 'Naib Saliib ' ordered ten boats to be sent to Zobarah to bring the families of these persons, and in compliance with these instructions the boats were sent; but on their arrival at Zobarah Shaikh Jasim ordered the Turkish soldiers to seize them and they did so and hauled up the boats after removing the gear and sails, and for this reason I am very sad. I had sanguine hopes in God and the British Government. The Sphinx left for Zobarah, and I was anxiously expecting that she should take the necessnry steps to release them from Jasim's hands. After the third day she returned, leaving them there in trouble. In the meantime two of the crew of thes^ boats escaped and came to. me and represented the troubles, ill-treatment and the starvation to which their comrades were subjected, and that the people of Zobarah would not pro vide them with anything. I have hopes in the kindness of Government that their grievances may be looked into and they may be freed. I also beg to state that reliable information is constantly being received of Jasim's actions to cnuser disorder and his collecting a large number of villains from the Bedouins and others, and his intention to surprise Bahrein. He had given out that he was waiting for an opportunity for tiiis purpose, but I hope by the power of God and yours, he will be repelled in hopelessness: It has become necessary to request you to bestow your kind attention to this matter.

The Political Resident proposes to reply that the fullest responsibility rests on Turkish oilicials. lie also advises the release by force of Bahrein boats whose detention at Zobarah was reported in my telegram of the 27th July. I have told him to take no action in either case pending instructions.

The necessary communication has been made to Com mander Pelly regarding his action in the event of hostile demonstration against Bahrein. A copy of Commander Pelly's last despatch* received yesetrday is enclosed m i n oo i a x -.v. ! * fr* tlie information of Government; no • Dated 22ud August with enclosure. • c ' * i i . event oi importance has occurred during the week, and the situation appears to be not materially changed. Some signi ficance may, however, attach to the rumour of warnings to his subordinates by the Mutasarrif against an attack on Bahrein, as possibly indicating a caution from the Ottoman Government to its representatives, against acts that would more seriously compromise it. 2. Should there be truth in this rumour, the general position disclosed is in no way improved, and is in my opinion exceedingly unsatisfactorv. For the Mudir at ZDbarah and the Commander of the Turkish vessel' Zulwf having both declared Shaikh Jasim (presumably as Kaim Makam of Katr) their superior, the reported instructions to them, would indicate a confusion and uncertainty of authority, and a consequent irresponsibility in action, of a dan gerous character. In this connection, I have to report the further information w hich has reached me, of a letter from the Mutasarrif of llasa to Shaikh Esa, stating that in reply to his orders for the arrest of the pirate Ahmad-bin- Salman, he had learned that the man was a Bahreini. Such an apologv, when the occasion demands the most strenuous efforts to arrest this ruffian, is an insult to reason, the man having left Bahrein for Turkish territorv, where he has since resided, 18 months ago. 3. It seems to me so gravely open to doubt whether Jasim can rightly be regarded as a responsible otBcer of the Ottoman Government, and our position resulting from this doubt, and the attitude of the local Turkish officials gene rally, has become so unsatisfactory and indeed intolerable, that I venture to submit a course of action for consideration. I do this w ith the utmost diffidence, having regard to my ignorance of the views of the Government of Indiain communication with Her Majesty's Secretary of State on the whole question, and of the international considerations which, in their opinion, may he involved. I woi^ld accordingly ask that my suggestion be taken rather as one for a course which appears to me direct and practicable in the event of a decision to adopt extreme measures, than as distinct proposal in the existing circumstances. I would submit then that after such communication to the Porte as may be deemed fit Shaikh Jasim's relation to that Government should be ignored, and that in view of his wanton association of himself with matters between Bahrein and a section of its disaffected people, and in pursuance of the deliberate warning addressed to him at the outset of the present difficulty, he should be directly dealt with. That an ultimatum should be addressed to him demanding the instant restoration of the Bahrein boats unwarrantably held in detention at Zobarah, and his withdrawal together with his followers and any Bedouins or others under his influence, from Zobarah and its immediate neigh bourhood, on pain of operations by force of arras to be directed against him on or after a given date, whatever might be decided, including Al-Bidaa. Prom a careful study of the chart, and my observation at a former visit to the locality, as well as from other sources of information, I have been led to the conclusion that Al-Bidaa is one of the few places on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, which is especially liable to etfective naval attack without mili tary support. The presence of a detachment of Turkish troops is the only objection,—and that from a political rather than a military point of view, of which I am aware,—to operations against Al-Bidaa. These troops might be called upon to retire before the operations against Jasim. Zobarah is not so open to attack, owing to shoal water, but might nevertheless be probably effectively shelled from the sea. Dated Bahrein, the 22nd August 1895. l/ From— Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander and Senior Officer, To—Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to further inform you as follows The messenger who took my letter concerning Shaikh Salim's family, was warned by the Commander of the Zuhaf not to appear at Zobarah again, and in consequence Shaikh Esa thought it inadvisable to send my second letter there concerning the reported act of piracy. I have received an answer to my first letter, a copy of which I enclose, desiring me in future to address the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa. It is reported that the pirate Ahmad-bin -Salman has seized a pearling boat belonging to Jasim's following. Authentic news has been received that the Zuhaf left Zobarah on the morning of the 19th and reached Katif on the following day. It is rumoured that the Mutasarrif has written to Jasim warning him against attacking Bahrein, also to the Commander of the Zuhaf and to the Mudir to prevent Jasim in any attempt upon Bahrein. Shaikh Esa has received a letter from El-Hasa stating that the Mutasarrif has written to Nasir-bin-Mubarak, demanding the arrest of the pirate Ahmad- hin-Salman, but Nasir replied to the effect that this man is a Bahreini.

In ccntinnation of my telegrams of the 12th instant, I have the honour to report, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council, that on the 6th instant Commander Pelly, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Station, having in his judgment, after careful consideration of the facts immediately before him, determined that prompt action was the only means of avprting the plunder of Bahrein with its attendant ex cesses, attacked and destroyed some 44 out of a fleet of native craft assembled oil Zobara, armed and ready for an instant descent on that place. T enclose a copy of Commander Felly's despatch of the 7th instant and of its enclosures reporting the operations. Commander Felly's despatch must have been written under pressure of haste and many demands on his attention, and it seems desirable that I should supplement it with a state ment of the considerations bearing on the situation, within my own knowledge. 2. 'Recently, as has been reported, the chief representative of Ottoman authority in this region, the Mutasarif of El-Hasa, formally intimated that the tribes of Katr having passed out of the control of authority, had determined on the attack of Bahrein, which holds a number of British subjects, and a very large amount of British-owned wealth. The Muta sarif accordingly, repudiating all responsibility for the catastrophe which he thus notified as imminent, called for the removal of all British subjects within 17 days, an operation which would have been most ruinous if not impossible. Term of grace fixed by the Mutasarif expired on 5th instant, and as will be seen from Commander Felly's despatch, the local repre sentative of the Ottoman Government at Zobara then boarded H. M. S. ' Pigeon,' which had been ordered there to watch the hostile fleet of boats known to be there in pursuance of the declared intention to attack Bahrein. This official ordered the departure of the ship enforced by a threat, reasserted the resolve to attack Bahrein, which had been notified by his superior the Mutasarif, and added that the Turks would join in this attack. The boats themselves were present, fully armed and ready to proceed at once upon the operation. 3. These deliberate utterances, and the facts, therefore, left no possible room for doubt, go far as words and acts can make an intention certain, that the attack would be delivered, and there can hardly be a question as to the nature of the excesses and outrage which would attend an attack under such auspices. The only point on which a doubt conld arise is whether this attack would be with the direct countenance and support of the Turks or not, and though the statement of Shaikh Jasim in his letter of the 7th that the hostile fleet had been collected by the order of the Mutasaiif lends support to the word of the inferior officer (the Mudir), we are fully entitled to assume the full significance of the assurance of his superior, that the act would be that of irresponsible tribes beyond control, for which the Turkish Government could not answer. And here I would observe that the actual status of a person like Jasim, as to whether he is or is not a responsible officer of the Turkish Govern ment, is most difficult to determine. On the one hand he is the declared Kaim Makam of Katr; on the other, the assertions of the Mutasarif would make him the virtual leader of tribes who are beyond the control of authority, and for whose acts no responsibility is accepted by the Porte. The dilemma is the creation of the Porte, whose full responsibility in regard to either view that may be adopted would seem absolute. 4. Commander Pelly, on arrival at Zobara, found himself called upon to deal instantly with the grave question as to the best means of repelling the imminently threatened attack on Bahrein. There seems nothing to prevent its delivery the same night, the moon being full, as had doubtless been considered in fixing the term of 17 days' grace. Had this oppor tunity been given, and taken advantage of, I conceive it would have been a matter of extreme difficulty and indeed probably impossibility, for the ships to have taken effective action against a crowd of boats. Commander Felly has referred, in his despatch of 3rd, to the impossibility of following such a hostile fleet towards the south of Bahrein, by reason of the wafers not being surveyed, and a reference to the chart would seem to indicate that the limits within which operations could be carried on with due regard to the safety of H. M.'s ships, between Katr and the mainland generally, are extremely limited. Any delay in acting would therefore seem to have involved the gravest danger of a disaster. 5. On the morning after the operations, the 7th September, Shaik Jasim wrote his first letter, enclosed in Commander Pelly's despatch. It calls for littlo remark. 1 would only refer to the impudence of his reference to the appeal for 15 days' grace. The incident is , ^ T , dealt with in Commander Pellv's despatch of * Enclosure m my letter No. 7a ol Jitli July. „ T fi • v i i. Ii j i. i. gord* July, which also reports the detention, at the very time, of the boats sent from Bahrein for family and followers of Salim bin Hamad, who had made his peace with the Chief. To the significant assertion that the hostile boats had been collected under orders from the Mutasarif, I have already referred. 6. With regard to Commander Felly's reply imposing certain terms as the conditions of immunity for the remainder of the boats at Zobara, the first is in accordance with the original orders of Government. I wonld venture, however, to ask a re-consideration of the point as to insistance on the return of the whole A1 bin Ali tribe to Bahrein. Probably many,12 perhaps the oreater part, will elect to do so, but the relations of some with Sheikh Esa may now be such as to cause a mutual desire for separation. I would ask whether in such case, e vacua tiwiof Zabara being rigidly enforced, the condition as to return to Bahrein might be iXed As to the fourth condition, the number of boats delivered over is not yet known, nor whether these belong, for the most part, to the A1 bin Ah or to JWs people ; the Residency Agent at Bahrein, however, reports that crews sulhcient to navigate about boats have been requisitioned. Since writing the above I have received your telegram of this date. 1 regret to add my tear that Commander Pelly has suffered very severely from the severity of the hot season of this climate, to the extreme of which he has been exposed lor over two months. The heat is now abating. No. 06O. ^ ^ ^ gphi nx 'f a t Zobara, the 7th September 1895. 1/ \ From— C aptain J. H. P ellt , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To— C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident, Persian Gulf. I have the honor to inform you that I did not go to Zobara as intimated in my last letter having met the ' Pigeon at sea and despatched Enclosures 5 in No. ^here in my stead, with orders to keep a strict watch upon the movements of the hostile dhows that were known to be there. On the evening of the 5th instant I received a letter from the ' Pigeon informing me that the Mudir hatf been on board that vessel and ordered her immediate departure from /obara, accompanied by a threat §hould the order not be obeyed. He informed Lieutenant Com mander Cartwright that Jasim intended to attack Bahrein with the boats there assembled, and that so far from preventing him, they (the Turks) were themselves going to join m this attack upon Bahrein. At davlight on the 6th instant 1 therefore proceeded to Zobara, arriving about noon, and after taking into careful consideration the serious nature of the^ facts as laid before me by- Lieutenant Commander Cartwright and that these boats were stationed here fully armed and readv to proceed at once for an attack upon Bahrein, I determined as the only cours? open for me for the prevention of this attack, to destroy by tire this hostile licet. I accordingly sent a letter to Jasim, who is here, warning him that in one hour s time from his receipt of this letter I should commence operations. I opened tire, the 'Pigeon ' assisting, at 3-45 p.m ., that day keeping up a steady, continual shell fire until sunset. I then despatched 3 boats, manned and armed, in command of Lieuten ant and Commander Cartwright, taking inflammable stores with them for the purpose of burnino- as many of the dhows as possible, keeping up a blank fire during their absence trorn the ^hip to scare away the natives. They succeeded in burning 8 of the dhows, ihe total number of dhows destroyed as far as can ba ascertained from the ship is about 44. A flag of truce was flying on shore this morning, and I received a letter from Jasim, to which I sent a reply stating ray terms for his surrender.

'When I came to this place (Zobara) my object was no other than (to promote) good, and from the time I came here I sued for your pardon and (begged you) to abstain from unlawful deeds. I complied with your wishes on that very day.My former letters to the Resident, Assistant (Resident) and Mahomed Raheem are with you. Again, when Sheikh Esa became obstinate, I deputed to him my son Khalifah, who begged for 15 days' respite, which, however, was not obtained. And you are acquainted with all that. When I did not attain my object, and the Mutasarif's request to you for (the exercise of) good and the restoration of the plundered property was also not granted, he (the Mutasarif) ordered me to call all the boats (to Z^bara) with what object I did not know: whether to inti midate Sheikh Esa into an acquiescence in good deeds; or for the purpose of removing the people from Zobara. And thus the boats remained (at Zobara) waiting for his (Mutasarif's) orders. Had I entertained aggressive designs and resolved to attack Bahrein, I would not have waited for three months. (On the contrary) I was using my efforts towards a good end. Now all women and children have been destroyed, some by the guns, and others fled to the desert and perished there, without my knowledge or any intimation from you. I now sue for your pardon, kindness, and assurance of safety {amdn). I do not entertain (feelings of) opposition towards you.

It is evident therefore that you are the cause of this gathering, but as you have asked foigiveness and peace, this is only obtainable under the fol lowing conditions:— (1) The evacuation of Zobara by the A1 bin AH and the return of that tribe to their allegiance to their Chief (Sheikh Esa bin Ali of Bahrein). (2) The dispersal of all Bedouins now collected at or near Zobara. (3) The return of the nine boats that you took belonging to the people of Bahrein. (4) The delivery of all the boats now at Zobara as part security of any indemnity the Political Resident may levy upon you and that these boats be brought by unarmed men and anchored off the ship.

I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith copy of note verbal* which I have addressed to the Sublime Porte, in accordance with the instructions contained in Your Lordship's telegram No. 129 of the 7th instant, remonstrating with the Imperial Goverrment on the action of their local officials on the El Katr Coast and repeating that all claims to Bahrein, which is under the protection of Her Majesty, are totally inadmissible. (Sd.) P. CURR1E. No. 369. Xfofc T'erhale to Sublime Porte. No. 84, dated Therapia, the 12th August 1895. On November 11th, 1892, Her Majesty's Embassy had the honour to address a note verhale to the Sublime Porte, drawing 'the attention of the Imperial Government to the assurance given on December 10th, 1871, by Server Pasha, then Minister for foreign Affairs, to M. Pisani, First Dragoman of this Embassy, to the effect that the Sublime 1 orte had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremacy over the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, and stating that as Bahrein was now under the protection ot the Queen of England, no interference by Ottoman authorities with natives of that island could be admitted. Information was received in the month of June of this year from the Government of India to the effect that the Al bin Ali tribe Had the intentiou of forming a settlement at / Zobara on the Persian Gulf with the support of the Turkish Mutasanf of llasa (el Ansa) who was further reported to have sent troops to Zobara under the command ot the Mudir of El Bidaa. These movements, io the opinion of Her Majesty's Government, constituted a serious menace to Bahrein, and representations were verbally made to 11 is Excellency luikban Pasha, whose attention was called to tbe above mentioned note verhale. Further information has now been received to the effect that the Mudir of Zobara claims the Al bin Ali tribe settled at Zobara, as Turkish subjects, by order of the _ Mutasanf, and declares Bahrein unconditionally, and the El Katr ^coasl as partly, subject to Ottoman jurisdiction.15 Her Majesty's Embassy have been instructed to address a rpmonstrance to tlie Sublime Porte on the proceedings of their local officials on the tl Katr Coast, over which Her Majesty's Government do not recognise Turkish jurisdiction, and must repeat once more that all Turkish claims to Bahrein, which is under the protection of the Queen of England, are totally inadmissible, and that measures will be taken to protect the i&amp;laud from awo-ression.

In continuation of this office letter of the 26th August, I am desired by Lord Georo-e Hamilton to forward herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a further telegram from the Viceroy, dated the 1st September, from which it will be seen that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf advises that the Bahrein boats under detention at Zobara should be forcibly releaspd, and the Government of India enquire if this course may be followed if it can be undertaken with certainty of success. 2. Lord George Hamilton considers that the suzerainty exercised by Great Britain over Bahrein justifies the adoption of forcible measures for the recoverv of the Bahrein boats which are detained at Zobara by the Turkish authorities (see Viceroy's telegram of the 27th July), and, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, His Lordship proposes to instruct the Government of India to issue the necessary orders for obtaining possession of these boats. No. 372. No. 101, dated Bushire, the 2l8t September 1895. 1/ From— C olonel F. A. W ilsok , Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegram of the 18th instant I have the honour to forward for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council, copy of a « Dated 16th September. despatch* from Lieutenant Commander Taylor, 11. M. S. 1 lassy, who has assumed the duties of Senior Naval Officer, on Commander Pelly's departure, invalided. 2. I have also received information that my Assistant, Mr. Gaskin, had, at Sheikh Jasim's request, an interview with him on the 9th, landing at Zobara with the boats sent to take possession of the dhows, the Surrender of which, had been demanded after the action of the t'th. Jasim showed the utmost submission, repeating his declaration that he had entertained no idea of attacking Bahrein, but had been ordered by the Mutasarif to collect all the Katr boats and Bedouins for that purpose, with an intimation that a simultaneous attack would be made by Bedouins from Hasa and Ojair. He said also that he had been informed that the ships would not interfere for the protection ot Bahrein, over which there was no Protectorate. ^ ith regard to the threatening letters which he had written to Sheikh Esa, he asserted his intention to have only been to intimidate the Chief into restoring the boats that had been seized in July. Jasim begged that the surrender of the remaining boats in the harbour might not be insisted on, and Mr. Gaskin being entirely unprotected, and finding the numerous armed men who were collected getting excited at the taking of the boats which was in operation, had to cut short the interview and retire on board. Mr. Gaskin also saw several of the Al bin AH, gave them assurances of safety on the part of Sheikh Esa, and arranged for their return, helping them as regards transport with the captured dhows. 3. It is evident that Commander Pelly's demand for the surrender of the mass of native craft in the harbour at Zobara has been complied with, though precise details are not vet available. Seventy-six boats, however, are reported to have reached Bahrein, and 40 more16 with the A1 bin Ali and their families were expected Mr. Gaskin estimates tlie number of the A1 bin A!i at present returning, at one-third of the total, the rest to be brought over as means availed. I trust the lesson that has been given will prove adequate to eiTeetually repress the influences for mischief, which had brought about a position of such grpve danger. The re-appearance of the Turkish war vessel ' Zuhaf,' which was expected at Z dtara on the 15th May, however, possibly caused delay and complication. Without further assurance, therefore, of a satisfactory settlement of the difficulties generally, I was not able, in reply to your telegram of the 19th, to advise the immediate departure of H. M. S. u Plassy 4. In the absence of instructions upon Lieutenant Commander Taylor's enquiry as to enforcing the evacuation of Zobara, which I telegraphed on the Ibth, I am intimating that the return of the A1 bin Ali, probably involving the practical evacuation of the place, opera tions to enforce the departure of any small remnant of tribesmen need not bp undertaken pending further instructions from Government on tbe subject. But that should any section of the Al bin Ali still attempt to maintain their position there, the original measures for their coercion by seizure of their boats should be taken. I am approving the proposal to send Jasim a stern warning in respect of the piracies reported. 5. I enclose translation of a letter from the Bahrein Chief, dated 15th instant, expressing his gratitude for the protection afforded him by Her Majesty's ships. Also a copy of a letter of thanks signed by 15 British Indian subjects of Bahrein, declaring themselves very grate ful for their deliverance from dangpr; their sentiments, though somewhat crudely conveyed, are in pleasiuij contrast with those expressed by some of their countrymen, recently, in a somewhat similar position. 6. Mr. Gaskin reports that Commander Felly's letter of the 6th, warning Jasim that he would destroy the hostile boats in an hour, was delivered by him to a Turkish Lieutenant, whom he found with about 12 soldiers in the dhow nearest to the ship, for conveyance to Jasim, as it appeared unsafe in the circumstances to land.

W ilson , Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you I have arrived here, and on Commandrr Pelly proceed ing home iu the Mail Steamer ' Chanda,' invalided, have taken over the duties of Senior Otiicer. I shall feel obliged if you will send over 1-10 tons of coal for the use of this ship as soon as possible. I have forwarded an Admiralty Bill for £380 and will feel obliged if you will send the amount in rupees according to exchange as soon as convenient. Will you please telegraph my arrival both to the Admiral and Senior Officer, Bombay. I propose sending H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' to Zobara on the 18th instant to see if the orders issued by Her Majesty's Government and Commander Pelly are being carried out. Should the town not be evacuated by the 2()th instant, as ordered, I should be glad to receive instructions from you as to whether the evacuation is to be enforced or not. 1 would suggest that as this has always been one of the Government conditions, it should now be rigidly enforced. As far as can be ascertained, about 76 of the captured boats have arrived here, besides which, there are several others in which the families of the Al bin Ali tribe have embarked, but have not yet arrived at their moorings. It has been reported that the Turkish Gunboat &lt;r Zuhaf ' arrived at Katif on Thursday morning, and after disembarking a few troops for Ojair, left on Sunday morning for Zobara. Her arrival there has not yet been authenticated. It is also reported that a Turkish official has Wen specially despatched by ' Zuhaf ' to Lahasa to enquire into the whole situation. News has been received of a daring act of piracy committed by some Bedouins on a Cutch boat, killing two persons on board and taking away some specie. It is believed that the Cutch boat has gone to Linga. The outrage took place close to Fasht Debil while the boat was on her way to Bahrein. Another attempt has been reported off the same place, in which the pirates were successfully repulsed, but not before having wounded two Bahreinees. I would suggest that these acts be immediately suppressed, as after the recent action there appears to be every probability they will increase, undoubtedly at Jasim bin Thani's instiga tion ; so with your authority, I will send Jasim a warning, holding him responsible for any further acts, and liable for any indemnity that may be claimed.No. 874f. Dated 25tli Kal)i-ul-Awal, 13l3 = 15th September 1895. From - S haikh E sa bin A li , Chief of Bahrein, To—The Resident, Persian Gulf. After compliment*. —Previous to this I addressed you on the 5th (the 26th August) nnd 14th Rabi-ul-Avval (J.th September 1895), informing you of the collection of the Katr people at Zobara and that Jasim had, owing to the help he received from the M utasarif of l^l-Ilassa, determined to attack Bahrein. Four points of attack were arranged as follows :—Jasim and the Katr people were to attack from the direction of Manamah, Sultan Bin Salamah and the A1 Bin Ali from near jVloharrak, Maser Bin Mubarek and his Beni Hajir near Ras-ei-Burr, and the men of the Mutasarif, viz., Abdur Rahman Bin Salamah and Selman Elfendi with the Mudir from the West (of Bahrein). This was their main project. There was however some difference in the details as reported by Bahrein boatmen who were detained at Ztbara and who fled from there. When this news was confirmed and the Extra Assistant was informed of it, H. M. S. ' Sphinx ^ left for Zobara on the 16th Ilabi-ul-A\val 131*5 (6th September 1395). They' (II. M. S. Sphinx') saw the gathering themselves, punished them and dispersed them bv cannon. The other man-of-war (H. M. S. Pigeon) also did the same. They took the majority of their (Jasim's) boats. These occurrences were owing to the auspiciousness of your presence (in the Gulf), I am most extremely thankful to the Almighty and then to you, and I am bound bv the ties of gratitude to you even unto the end of this world [i.e., until his death) for the quick ness of the pursuit of the aforesaid (Jasim). This has averted bloodshed on both sides, and the Almighty has granted safety to all my subjects both as regards their persons and their properties. They uplift their hands in prayer for you to be always present and victorious. They have now been left in peace and safety under the shadow of your protection which is subject to neither injury or change in the process of time. May you always be in power. I have written this letter for the purpose of expressing my deep sense of gratitude to you. To —Captain J. H, P ellt, H. M. S ' Sphinx.' 'We, the Hindu Merchants and British Indian subjects residing in Bahrein, beg most respectfully to testify our heartfelt gratitude and thankfulness to you, Commander Cart- wright and Mr. J. C. (laskin, Extra Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gu,f, who have settled the disturbed state of our affairs in Bahrein. The Arabs in Zobara, headed by Jasim Bin Thani, were about to make an attack on Bah rein from four sides of the island with the intention of plundering the place and killing the inhabitants. Had this not been prevented by you, the loss of British prestige, and the pro perty and lives of the inhabitants of Bahrein, would have been immense, especially amono- our Hindoo brethren. The timely arrival of II. M. S. ' Sphinx' and 'Pigeon' at Z^bara and the bombardment of the place and capture of some of the boats oc the enemy that were about to start against Bahrein, fortunately put an end to the intended attack. We are at a loss for words to express our thanks to Captain Pelly, who, defeat ing the intentions of the enemy, has brought to our vivid rpcollectious the glorious deeds of his illustrious uncle, Col. Sir Lewis Peliy, who put down many and similar disturbances in the past in these very parts. We assure you that not only we are thankful to you, but the ruler of the place and all his subjects are also equally thankful to you and the British Government for the safety of their lives. To Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Extra Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, we are very thankful for his great assistance and valuable advice in all matters during the disturbance. We also avail of this opportunity to thank Agha Mahomed Rahiin Saffar and Agha Khalil for their great trouble taken in this matter. And last but not least we are very thankful to Colonel F. A. Wilson, our Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, who has slowly but surely saved Bahrein from the dangers that were threatening her people for the last six months. We sincerely hope and fully trust that the Government will appreciate the services of all Naval and Civil officers and men who have taken part in this matter and who have averted a very serious catastrophe. In conclusion we pray Almighty God for the prosperity of our Government and a long life to our Empress of India whose benign protection tor her subjects in far and distant parts of the world is ever great.

Tn continuation of my telegram of the 25th instant, I have the honour to forward, for the information of Government, a copy of a despatch, dated 2ilrd instant, from Lieutenant Commander Taylor, Senior Naval Otficer, Persian Gulf. 2. The results of the decisive action taken hy Her Majesty's ships appear to have been most satisfactory, and 1 trust that no further difficulties may arise in the final adjustment of the troubles which have s&lt;i long prevailed in connection with Bahrein, ihe A1 l&gt;iu Ah have, as a bodv, returned to liahrem, and re-'umed their residence there undor the Ohicl s assurance of the maintenance of the conditions which thpy formerly enjoyed. Sheikh Sultan with a few followers alone appears disposed to keep alool, Shaikh Lsa being rea ly to actjuiesce completely in his alienation. 3. In pursuance of the desire, in your telegram of the Hth, that a statement should be obtained from Jasim of his part in recent affairs, my Assistant, Mr. Gaskin, arranged an interview with him on the 21st. Jasim again disclaimed all hostile intent on his own part, and asserted that the Mutasarif of Hasa had encouraged the Albin Ali to settle at Zobara, with a promise of protection, had assured him, after the first seizure of A1 bin Ali boats, that the Turkish Government would procure their release, directing him to write to Sheikh Esa requiring their restoration, failing which he was to attack Bahrein, and that when hopes of their Recovering the boats failed, the Mutasarif ordered him to collect the Katr boats and such men as he could muster for the attack, and sent some of the Bedouin tribes to support him. Jasitn begged for pardon, and for the restoration of the boats taken after the operations of the 6th instant, on the ground that they had been collected under the Mutasarif s orders ; he expressed his earnest desire to come under British protection, undertaking to guard the Katr peninsula provided only that he should be defended from attack by sea. 4. I am entirely unable to accept Jasim's disclaimers, and consider his responsibility is fully established, whatever may have been the motives actuating himself and the Turks in their mutual relations in these proceedings. It has been said that Jasim hoped for a loss of lurk- ish prestige and authority as the result of the course adopted, which would enable him to recover a practical independence ; it has also been rumoured, even at Bushire, that the lurks secretlv desired that Jasim, whose effective subjection they have been unable to compass, and who inHicted a most disastrous reverse on their troops in IS93, should be crushed by being driven into a collision with British power. 5. In evidence of his assertions Jasim declared that he possessed ten letters from the Wali of Busreh, and double that number from the Mutasarif of Hasa, but that he could only produce these if assured of British protection, as otherwise he would be exposed to lurkisli vengeance. I can hardly presume that Government would be disposed to entertain the request for the assurances which Jasim professes to desire, but I would ask whether he is to be directly dealt with, in any manner. I would also request that I may be informed by telegram wheth er 1 am to expect any instructions upon the whole position, and especially in regard to the boats now held at Bahrein, before submitting my final conclusions, A Sheikh of the A1 bu Gowarah, inhabiting the western side of the Katr peninsula appeared before me yesterday, with a plea for the restoration of 28 boats of that tribe among those captured, on a similar ground to that of Jasim, siz., that he, while really a friend of Sheikh Esa, had been compelled (by Jasim) to take a hostile attitude. He was informed that no distinction was possible among those found in open hostility, and that his boats would be subject to the final orders of Government with the rest. No. 377. Dated H. M. S. 'Plassy,' at Bahrein, the 23rd September 1895. From - L ieutenant W. F. T aylob , Commander, Uer Majesty's Ship ' P lasst,' To—The Political Agent, Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that I sent H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' to Zobara on the 1 8th to see the terms given by Commander Pelly were being carried out, and also to try and find out what the Turkish gunboat ' Zuhaf ' had gone there for. I proceeded there in H. M'.s ship under my command on the 20th, arriving in the after noon, when Lieutenant Commander Leggatt informed me that on his arrival only a few Arabs were in the town and that ten dhows had left since his arrival, also that Jasim bin Mohamed19 bin Thaai and Sheikh Sultan bin Mahomed Salamah were living in a village about 7 miles inland. The Zuhaf arrived at Zobara on the IGth and left on the 17th for Katief. A letter was sent them from the shore. He also gave me letters from Jasim and Sultan which are forwarded. I sent on shore the interpreter and pilot of the 'Sphinx' with a letter for Jasim from Mr. Gaskin, saying, if Jasim wanted to see him, he was to come in at once. The interpret er reported that the town was completely evacuated, only a messenger from Jasim with a letter being there. Jasim came in early the next morning and Mr. Gaskin saw him, but could get no further information respecting Turkish co-operation. He is anxious to be taken under British pro tection, and states that if this is done, he can produce some 30 letters from Turkish officials to prove his statements, explaining he was afraid that, unless under our protection, the lurks wyuld revenge themselves on him for exposing their intrigues. There are 50 boats close to or on the beach, some of which can be repaired, so l have given Jasim a further 14 days to repair them. Some could not be repaired in the time, so he has been informed that, if it appears he has made every effort towards repairing them, he may be granted a further extension. The A1 bin Ali tribe have also been warned to remove their huts in that time, after which no one will be allowed there. Ninety-nine boats have been delivered and the remainder are reported to be on the island, but not yet given up. In all, 6 slaves (4 male and 2 female), the whole of which are apparently new importa tions, have been either to one of H. M's. ships or the Agency requesting their freedom, and steps are being taken with Sheikh Esa to grant them their manumission. It seems that during the last few years several importations have taken place at a place called Hadd on the Maha- rak Island ; therefore that Sheikh Esa has not kept to the terms of the treaty. As it appears to me that the whole disturbance is quelled and there seems no likelihood of any recurrence, I should suggest your telegraphing to the Admiral saying there is no need of three ahips being detained in the Gulf. Should I receive no information by either mail, I shall send H. M. S. c£ Spliinx' to 'Bushire for change. No. 378.

W ilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of telegraphic correspondence, I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, on the difficulty which has arisen at Bahrein in connection with an attempted settlement at Zobarah. 2. Early in March the Albin-Ali tribe, incensed at some violence done to. one of their chief men by the brother of Sheikh Esa of Bahrein, talked of re moving to the Katr Peninsula. A few days later an attempt to seize some of the Albin-Ali concerned in a quarrel with certain goldsmiths led to a collision in which shots were exchanged and two men on each side were killed. Sheikh Sul- tan-bin-Mohamed Salamah, the head of the tribe, then left Bahrein with some of his leading men, and went in the first place to Roweis near the north point of the Katr Peninsula, whence the local Chief attempted ostensibly at least to arrange matters. Sheikh Sultan almost immediately got into communication with Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani, who also professedly exerted his good offices to settle the difference. There can, however, hardly be a doubt that Jasim, whether or no he fostered the quarrel from the beginning, very soon saw in it a means to further his own aims and to carry out a design which he has before attempted, of a settlement at Zobarah. 3. Accordingly, early in April a letter from the Bahrein Chief intimated that though he had not been seriously concerned at the alienation of Sheikh Sultan, the object now declared, of a settlement at Zobarah, was a serious menace and injury to his position at Bahrein. The Chief further said he could turn the in truders out by force if thought advisable. I then reported the matter to Govern ment by telegram ; and upon the receipt of the instructions contained in your telegram of the 21st April, requested the Commander of H. M. S. Bramble to proceed to Bahrein with Mr. Gaskin, Assistant to the Resident, in order to communicate to Sheikh Jasim the warning which I had been directed to convey to him. I enclose for reference copy, in translation, of my letter to Sheikh Jasim, and of a letter which I thought it advisable to address to Sheikh Sultan. The Bramble sailed on 22nd and returned on the evening of the 26th with Sheikh Sultan's reply to my letter, and the information which Lieutenant Commander Currey and Mr. Gaskin had been able to obtain. Sheikh Jasim being in the interior at some days' distance from Zobarah, his answer only reached me by mail on the 1st May. Copies, in translation, of these two letters are en closed for reference. 4. The position as gathered from further reports of the Residency Agent by the mail, supplementing the information brought by H. M. S. Bramble, has become somewhat complicated. My instructions to Mr. Gaskin, apart from the warnings he was to convey, were to use every endeavour to induce the Sheikh of Bahrein and Sheikh Sultan to accept his good offices towards a reconciliation. These instructions were carried out by Mr. Gaskin with care and judgment, but unfortunately with little result, owing probably to the outside influences at work. Sheikh Sultan refused to return to Bahrein immediately, except practi cally under compulsion, which would have been useless. He stated that it was only after leaving Bahrein that on his appeal to Sheikh Jasim, and on the latter's invitation, he went to Zobarah; and at his desire that he had raised the Turk ish flag there, which, however, he agreed to remove: it had, in fact, ceased to fly before the Bramble left. Sheikh Esa evidently considered that Sheikh Sultan had too far identified himself with the enemies of Bahrein to return to his allegi ance. He declined to accept a condition of his return which Sheikh Sultan had proposed, viz. —that the tribe should be allowed a separate habitat at El-Had, a village a few miles from the Chiefs headquarters ; holding that this would be fatal to his own authority and would facilitate the designs of Sheikh Jasim and his enemies to usurp his authority and ultimately overthrow his rule. He accord- ingly preferred that Sheikh Sultan and his tribe should sever their connection from Bahrein altogether,3 5. Important later news is that a few days after the departure of H. M. S. Bramble the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa arrived with the intention of taking the mail steamer to Busrah; but on learning the state ot affairs, and being met by a letter from Jasim, he abandoned that design and proceeded instead at once to Zobarah. Jasim's letter is said to have informed the Mutasarrif of the purport of the warning he had received from me, and added that the removal of settlers at Zobarah was a matter for the Turkish authorities; that it was desirable to raise the Turkish flag, and that he awaited the arrival of the Mutasarrif there. It is further reported by the Residency Agent that information had reached him that representatives of the Manasir and Beni-Hajir tribes had visited Sheikh Sultan, had received valuable presents, and had entered into compacts to support him. 6. Sheikh Sultan in his letter asks for delay in obeying the order for his removal at the close of the pearl season. Such delay is, in my opinion, quite inadmissible : it is not justified by any necessity of the situation, and can only be intended to afford time for consolidating the position and for the operation of intrigues to secure its permanence. I regard his expressed readiness to be reconciled with his Chief as empty words, and consider that he now feels himself too much enmeshed in the intrigues of Jasim and others to return to his former position under Bahrein. Should he thoroughly realize that his aspirations for a settlement at Zobarah, supported by Jasim and local Chiefs, with possibly Turkish connivance, are hopeless, his attitude might very probably change. Sheikh Jasim's letter is evidently merely an evasion, and his pretence of looking for our assistance in proceedings which he well knows to be directly opposed to the policy of Government, is curiously bold. By the ' owners ' to whom he proposes to leave Katr, he must be taken to mean the Turks. 7. Bahrein trade has increased, and to this fact may probably be attributed the movement with regard to Zobarah, which now threatens to assume more importance. A settlement there fostered by Jasim's machinations, with possibly higher support, is regarded by Sheikh Esa as fatal to the well-being of Bahrein. It would, I consider, lead to grave complications, besides furnishing a base for actual aggression. The Albin-Ali who have gone there are said to number some i,S 00 ) including women and children; and should success be permitted to attend their movement, it is to be feared that the Naeem, Chaban and Dawasir tribes might be seduced from their allegiance to Bahrein and be led to abandon it and join the seceders to its entire ruin. 8. On the foregoing considerations I am led to the conclusion that the threatened situation calls for absolute prohibition to be carried into effect by force if necessary. I therefore ventured to recommend in my telegram of the 2nd that I should be authorised to enforce the demand upon the Albin-Ali to evacuate Zobarah. by seizing their boats if necessary. A distinct threat in this sense would, I hope, suffice—to be followed by action only if required by the circumstances. No. 75, dated Bushire, the 22nd April 1895. p rom C olonel F. A.

Mr. Gaskin, an Assistant in this Residency, has been desired to explain all this clearly to yuu ; and should you happily be wisely disposed in this matter, Mr. Gaskin will afford you his good offices to regain the favour of Sheikh Esa and to receive indulgence from him. I have every hope that in this way all difficulties may be arranged. But should you unfortunately not listen to this friendly advice, you will be liable to the grave displeasure of Government, and to very serious consequences, as on no account will such a settlement be permitted. .1 sorh Shawal T3fj Dated the 25th At , ri , r89S .

You have informed and ordered me that Zobarah should not be inhabited. Learn, oh friend ! that the origin of our departure from Bahrein arose out of a desire to stop a further development of the occurrences of which you are aware. Such being the case, what are we to do when you order that we should not reside in Zobarah, and we cannot go against your orders ? We have been under your orders and in obedience to you from olden times, and we have committed no action which is opposed to your wishes. Now our condition is weak as is known to you. The present is the season of our liveli hood, and half the number of our boats have been sent to Bahrein for being equipped for the work, and we cannot therefore obtain the means of moving from this place at once. We hope, therefore, that you will allow us time until the end of the pearl season, and then we shall not linger here. You can rest quite assured in all respects, so far as we are concerned. It is not possible for us to go against you. Our hope is in you and in the kindness of the great Government, that time will be allowed us; but if not, yours is the order. If we could know that a sincere understanding can be effected between us and Sheikh Esa, we would obey him and you. As long as we live no offence shall be committed either by myself or my followers.

I wrote to you a letter before. 45 After I had perused your letter which was wrongly addressed to me, I received your letter dated the Sn^n^and perused it. I found in it observations which are contrary to the friendship and good will which I cherish towards you— to the defence of the security which I maintain against evil of all sorts—to the settlement of those people at Zobarah and the conciliation which has been effected by me between them and Sheikh Esa, and to the guarantee which I have given that no misfortune shall befall them, nor shall they commit any aggression themselves. All this which I have done has been with the object of maintaining unbroken the bonds of cordial friendship which has existed of old between you and me. And as long as I possess that friendship from you I shall not look for it to others. But if I do not get from you the assistance and co-operation, it is needless for me to involve myself in the task of guaranteeing in any degree whatever the preservation of security on land and sea. And I shall leave Katr to its owners and save myself from troubles. I shall goto Zobarah on Monday to meet you and discuss matters personally, if an interview be possible.

In continuation of correspondence ending with my telegram of the 8th in stant, I have the honour to report in fuller detail for the iniormation of the Gov ernment of India— 2. In a letter by the last mail the Residency Agent at Bahrein reports, under date the 7th instant, that he had learned from people arriving from Zoba- rah that the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa on reaching Zobarah summoned Sheikh Jasim, who, sending on some masons and soldiers in advance, himself arrived on the cth,' and that they together set up a flag-staff for the Turkish flag. The report doe's not specificallv state whether the flag had up to the date of the informa tion been actually hoisted. It was further stated that musjids and houses were building. It is added by the Residency Agent that some regarded the arrival of the Mutasarrif as being with the express purpose of visiting Zobarah, the origin ally expressed intention of going on to Busrah being only for the purpose of concealing the real object. 3. It would appear that some years ago, when the question of the Turkish occupation of Zobarah was dealt with, doubts prevailed at the India Office as to the validity of the Bahrein claim to Zobarah, as against Turkish pretension— correspondence forwarded under your endorsement No. 2362-E of the 4th Novem ber 1890. For this I am quite unable to account, as I am unaware of the grounds on which such pretensions on the part of Turkey were based. And the narrative at pao-es 362 et seq. of the Selections from the Records of the Bombay Govern ment &amp; No. XXIV of 1856, would seem to show that the present holders of Bah rein originally settled at Zobarah in 1 766, and thence effected the conquest of Bahrein some 15 years later.

In continuation of my letter No. 44, of the nth instant, I have the honour to communicate, for the information of Government, the purport of further re ports received from the Residency Agent at Bahrein by the mail yesterday. 2. The Mutasarrif of El-Hasa after a stay of more than a week at Zobarah, and having given, it is said, assurances of support and full protection to Sheikh Jasim -bin-Thani and Sultan-bin-Salamah, and having promised to send a Mudir or Governor with some soldiers to Zobarah, himself left for Ojair and El-Hasa. The Mudir and soldiers sent from the former place are reported as having arriv ed at Zobarah about the 13th instant, and building operations as being in progress. The Mutasarrif again took the main island of Bahrein en route to Katif, halting for a night at Agarria and leaving for Katif on the 15th instant. Sheikh Jasim had helped Sheikh Sultan to equip his boats, which were starting for the pearling about the 12th instant. 3. Nasir-bin-Mubarik, a relative of Sheikh Esa of Bahrein, is also expected on the scene, being reported as encamped with a Beni-Hajir following between El-Hasa and Ojair. This man's restlessness and intrigues have constantly been a source of apprehension to Sheikh Esa. The last menace to the safety of Bahrein from this quarter was in October 1894 as noted in the Political diary of this office for the week ending 3rd November 1894, Part VI, item 7,, and a previous one was reported in my predecessor's letter No. 110. dated iSth August 1892.No. 52, dated Bushire, the 24th May 1895. From— Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, In continuation of previous correspondence, T have tlie honour to forward, for the information of Government, translation of a letter of the 21st instant, from the Chief of Bahrein, giving the recent movements of the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa in connection with the intrigues to establish a settlement at Zobarah. t 2. From the reports of the Presidency Agent at Bahrein it appears that by direction of the Mutasarrif a memorial had been prepared by Sheikh Sultan-bin- Salamah and signed by his principal tribesmen, appealing for Turkish support and protection, and that a caravanserai and houses for Sheikhs Jasim, Sultan and others are being built. The Mutasarrif left Bahrein by the mail steamer bringing these reports, taking with him Mohamed Abdul Wahab on the part of Sheikh Jasim and the petition referred to for presentation to superior authority. 3. There can no longer be any doubt that the intrigue, having for its object the establishment of a position which the Bahrein Chief regards—and as I con sider, with justice—a grave menace to his security and an unjust encroachment on his ancestral territories, is actively fostered by the local Turkish authority. It is evident'also that Sheikh Sultan's profession of submission as previous ly reported, and his plea for merely a delay in the enforcement of his departure from Zobarah, were insincere. Dated the 25th Djlkada 1312-(21st May 1895). From— Sheikh Esa-bin-Ali , Chief of Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I beo- to state that I reported to you in detail the case of the people of Zobarah, ^and have kept your Agent in Bahrein fully informed regarding the progress of events with a view to your being in possession of the news. As regards the Mutasarrif and his doings and plans I have been somewhat apprehensive, as he is the reverse of his predecessors. When he arrived at Bahrein the first time, he went to Zobarah and gave assurances of safety to the people of the place. He then went to Ojair and summoned Nasir-bm-Mu- barak and his Beni-Hajir followers, and had a consultation with them. He again returned to Bahrein (Agarria) and after two days' stay went to Katif. lie has a train come to Bahrein, but 1 have not learnt what his object is I have no mind to talk to him, and I observe an attitude of indifference towards him in order to secure your approval. I hope that you will bear this case (the movements of the Mutasarrif) in mind, and also the previous case (about Zobarah). My trust is in God and then in the greatness of your power.

Bramble were requisitioned for this purpose. 4. A report of the movements of the Bramble and the result of this mission is dven in Lieutenant and Commander Currey's letter to Colonel P A. Wilson, on his return to Bushire, a copy of which is forwarded herewith for your information. 5. The Political Kesident is in communication with the Government of India as to the stfeps to be tdken in regard to this matter, and has requested me to remain here to be in readiness to convey him to Bahrein if necessary. Dated Busbire, the ilGth April 1895. jr rorn Lieutenant E. H. C ukrey , Commander, H. M. S. Bramhle, fj&gt; 0 Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to inform you, in accordance with your memorandum to me (No 185, dated 21st April 1896), that having embarked Mr. Gaskin, Assist ant Political' Resident at Bushire, and also Mahomed Rahim, llesidency Agent at Bahrein, I left Bushire on Monday, April 22nd, arriving at Bahrein the fol- lowin 0 * dav. Upon my arrival I landed, accompanied by Mr.. Gaskin and Mahomed Rahim and paid a visit to the Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali. The Shaikh Esa- bin-Ali stated his case and ended by assuring us that he was prepared to swear bv the Koran that should Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed Salamah return to Bahrein he was prepared to receive him as if nothing bad happened, and to allow him and his tribe to reside in Bahrein as before. Havin'- received this assurance, I left the following day, Wednesday, April 24tb, and proceeded to Zobarah, where I arrived in the evening. On account of the shallowness of the water of this place, I was obliged to anchor a Ion'- way from the shore, some 4 miles out, and in consequence Mr. Gaskin, Mahomed Rahim, and 1 did not reach the shore till after 5 o'clock, and Mr Gaskin did not have time to finish his conversation with Shaikh Sultaa- 3bin-Mahomed Salamah, as we were obliged to return to the ship before complete dnrkness set in, owing to the great distance she was from the shore. Ho wever, before leaving, Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed Salamah stated that he would come back to Bahrein with us if we took him by force, but that he would not come of his own free will. Mr Gaskin and I agreed that the best thing to do under the circum stances was to leave Mahomed Rahim on shore for the night to see if he could persuade Sultan bin-Mahomed Salamah to do what was required of him, and said that we should return in the morning for his answer. AYe accordingly left the ship at 5 a.m . upon Thursday, April 25th, and upon our wny on shore encountered Mahomed Rahim coming otf in a native boat. He informed us that Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed Salamah had left dur ing the night to confer with Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani, and that the latter was away 4 days'journey into the interior. He had stated before leaving that he was prepared to leave Zobarah if H. M.'s Government insisted, but that he would not return to Bahrein and place himself under the Government of Shaikh Esa-biu-Ali of that place. I left Zobarah at 7 a.m . and arrived back at Bahrein at 2-30 p .m , when Mr. Gaskin, accompanied by Mahomed Rahim, left the ship to interview Shaikh E&gt;a-bin-Ali. Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali explained to Mr. Gaskin that, with a view to avoid future conflicts, he would rather that Sultan-bin-Mahomed Salamah did not return to Bahrein. Having received this answer I left Bahrein at 6-30 p.m ., arriving at Bushire at 5 p.m . the following day, April 26th. No. 69, dated Bushire, the 13th July 1895. From—C olonel F.

With reference to my telegram of the 11th instant, I have the honour to report more fully, for the information of the Government of India, on the action that has been taken on your telegram of the 3rd instant. 2. H. M. S. Sphinx sailed on the 5th with my letter conveying the • To suikh Sultan. No. 133, dated prders which Goverument had directed should be 5'h July 18^5; issued to Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mohamed Salamah. t So dated w. July 1895, .nd ^ translation of this * and copy of my letterf to enclosure 8 ' Z ' Commander lelly, R.N., are enclosed for re ference. In my letter to Shaikh Sultan I was careful to leave the door open to him for submission to the orders of Govern ment and to his duty to his Chief. Owing, however, to the influence of the Turkish Mudir probably, it was very ill received by the Shaikh, who, when it was at last and after an abortive attempt on the part of two Turkish soldiers to bar the way, presented to him by my Extra Assistant Mr. Gaskin, took an objectionable and even offensive tone. With my letter was delivered a se cond letter from Commander Pelly, a previous one having received no reply, and Captain Peliy in consequence of the insolent refusal to send any reply, which had been made to Mr. Gaskin, proceeded on the following morning, the 8th, to seize the boats of the tribe, seven being captured and conveyed to Bahrein for safe custody by the Chief. 3. Before leaving for Bahrein, Commander Pelly received a letter from the Mudir generally addressed to the officers of the British Government and to the Assistant Political Officer, claiming Zobarah as part of Turkish territory, and Shaikh Sultan and his tribe as having come under Turkish protection, pro testing against the proceedings taken, and requesting the departure of the ship. 4Copies of Commander Pelly's letter of proceedings of the 9th and of his two letters of the 7fch to Shaikh Sultan, and of Mr. Gaskin's report of the 8th, and also translation of the Mudir's communication, forwarded therewith, are enclosed. 4. My view has hitherto been that Turkish connection with the situation at Zobara'h should be ingored as far as possible, and communication with Tur kish officials avoided. I have now intimated to Commander Felly in a letter despatched by the Lawrence on the 11th, of which I enclose a copy, that, in my opinion, the claim advanced by the Mudir of the extension of Turkish protection to the Albin-Ali tribe, in their present position, cannot be admitted, and that his operations should proceed. No. 133, dated Bushire, the 5tli July l'S95. from—Colonel A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To — S haikh S ultan-bin- M ohamed S alamah. After compliments. —My former letter informed you clearly that, accord ing to the orders of Government, your establishment at Zabarah in defiance of your Chief could not be permitted. You replied expressing your continued submission to the will of Government, but asked for delay in obeying the com munication then made to you, till the conclusion of the pearl season.- It was quite impossible to admit this request and to allow you to act in defiance of the will of your Chief and the well-known wishes of the Government for several months' and the purport of your letter was accordingly reported to Govern ment. Though you must have known that the delay could not be permitted, you had taken no steps to do what was required of you up to 15 days ago. Now I have to convey to you the final and strict orders of Government to return at once with your tribe to Bahrein and your allegiance to your Chief. Know that if you fail now to obey, active measures to compel you to do so will no longer* be delayed. Be assured that these measures will be taken if you hesitate any longer to do what is required of you, and a further communi cation from me will not be necessary, as needful authority has been given to the man-of-war which will take this order to you to proceed to act as may be necessary. In my former letter I assured you of my good offices towards your recon ciliation with your Chief, and Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali also expressed his favorable disposition towards you. Your conduct in continued resistance has not deserv ed this.favor, but even now if you immediately submit yourself and return to Bahrein, my recommendation in your favor will be made to Shaikh Esa. I have hopes that you will not listen longer to the words of the evil-dis posed persons who have misled you, and miy thus escape the consequences of your rebellious conduct. No. 2-S. Z., dated Bushire, the 5th July 1895. Prom—Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—C ommander J. H. Pelly , R.N., H. M. S. Sphinx. You are aware of the general position with reference to the settlement which, in defiance of the Chief of Bahrein, and in direct opposition to the policy of Government, has been set up at Zobarah by Shaikh Sultan-bin- Mohamed Salamah, with the support, it is understood, of Shaikh Jasim-bin- Thani, and apparently the encouragement of the neig.ibouring Turkish author- itv. Shaikh Sultan received a very distinct warning more tlian two months ago that such a settlement would not be permitted. He replied requesting that the demand for his evacuation of Zobarah might he postponed till the close of the pearl season, at the same time professing submission. This request was inadmissible, and I have now received the instructions of Government to the effect that strict orders are to be conveyed to Shaikh Sultan to return immediately with his tribe to Bahrein and to his allegiance to his Chief, failing which active measures will be no longer delayed.I have accordingly the honour to enclose a letter under flying seal, address ed to Shaikh Sultan, conveying the orders of Government, and to request the favour of your proceeding with the vessel under your command to Zobarah and causing the letter to be delivered to Shaikh Sultan in such manner as you may judge most expedient. You will see that Shaikh Sultan is clearly warned that in the event of his hesitation to comply with the requisition now made upon him, measures to enforce it will no longer be delayed. I have therefore to request that should Shaikh Sultan's reception of the orders and warning now addressed to him not be fully satisfactory, you will, after giving him such time as in your judgment may, in the circumstances, be reasonable, proceed to seize such boats belonging to him and to his tribe the Albin-Ali, as you may be in a position to capture, in order to enforce submission to the orders of Govern ment. I would also request the favour of your receiving on board your ship Mr. Gaskin, an Assistant of this Residency, who will be able to assist you with much important local information and in your communications with Shaikh Sultan and any others with whom you have to deal. Mr. Gaskin will also, I hope, prove most valuable in forwarding a reconciliation between the Bahrein Chief and Shaikh Sultan, should the latter happily be so well advised as to seek it, as he has been urged to do. I append a memorandum on minor points which I would ask you to be good enough to make available to Mr. Gaskin also, for his guidance on such points as may more especially concern his action. No more recent information has been obtained than that acquired by your visit to the place some fifteen days ago ; it is possible therefore that the posi tion may have materially changed. Should such prove to be the case, and the change be such as to give hopes that the object of Government to prevent the settlement at Zobarah is in train to be secured, I would request you to use your discretion in dealing with Shaikh Sultan under the instructions of Government above indicated and to favor me with earliest information of the facts. Memo, dated Busliire, the 5th July 1S95. From— C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It would be very satisfactory that Shaikh Sultan should be summoned on board to receive the letter conveying the orders and warning which Govern ment has directed should be given to him and the communication which Captain Pelly may have to make to him. Very possibly, however, the Shaikh may, owing to pressure from Shaikh Jasim, or even local Turkish authority, be in a position to render his compliance with such a summons diificult. In such case it would be inadvisable to summon him on board. The Porte has received a warning from Her Majesty's Government in connec tion with its interference at Zobarah, and this warning should by this time have effect on the action of its representatives near that place; it is desirable however that Turkish connection with the situation should, as far as possible, be ignored. Should the seizure of boats become necessary, the course that seems most convenient would be to make them over to the Chief of 13ahrein, pending the further orders of Government. The Bahrein Chief w T ill doubtless be able to afford means for identifying the boats belonging to the Albin-Ali tribe, against which it may be necessary to act. He may also be expected to give all the assistance in his power to convey to Bahrein any of the tribe who may be willing to return, should their own boat-transport be insufficient. 1 he Chief has already expressed his readiness to show all possible indul gence to Shaikh Sultan and his followers, and should a disposition to submit be evinced, Mr. Gaskin should impress upon the Chief the necessity for facili- tating, by any means of conciliation that may be fitting and reasonable, an amicable solution of the existins: difficulty. 6The detention of the whole crews of any boats that may be seized would seem quite unnecessary ; one or two men should however be encouraged to re main in each boat, in order to secure the safety of any property left in them. Should any communication with Shaikh Jasim become necessary, he may be informed, in reply to any reference that he may make to his letter to Resident, that it vvas regarded as highly unsatisfactory and as not requiring reply, he being fully aware of the fixed determination of Government in regard to Zobarah. Dated H.M.S. Sphinx at Bahrein, the 9th July 1895. From— Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, To— Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In accordance with your memorandum dated 5th July 1895, I have the honour to report that, having embarked Mr. Gaskin (Assistant Resident), I left Rushire on the 5th instant and proceeded to Raiirein, arriving there on the following day. On my arrival Mr. Gaskin proceeded ashore to interview Shaikh Esa-bin- Ali, and returned in the evening accompanied by the Shaikh's brother, the Shaikh's Vizier and two Residency Agents, with whom I then proceeded to Zobarah, arriving at that place about noon on the 7th instant. I immediately sent my Interpreter ashore with a letter, requesting Shaikh Sultan to come on board to receive your letter addressed to him. To this he returned no answer, hut sent a reply to the Residency Agent, who had sent him a private note, to the effect that he was ill and could not do what was required of him. A copy of this correspondence is attached for your information. My Jnterpreter states that en landing he was not allowed by Turkish soldiers to see Shaikh Sultan, but was taken to the Turkish Mudir, were he met Shaikh Sultan's son, to whom he handed my letter to be taken to his father, who was said to be suffering from dysentery and unable in consequence to see anyone. Taking into consideration that Shaikh Sultan had through the intrigue of the Turkish Mudir (who appears to have followed the son and may have inter cepted my letter) treated my letter in an insulting manner, I considered it necessary to take further steps in this matter; and to ensure his receiving your letter, together with my ultimatum as to the action to be taken in default of any reply, I requested Mr. Gaskin to land and personally deliver them to Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed Salamah. Mr. Gaskin thereupon landed, accompanied by the Residency Agent and the Shaikh's Vizier (Mr. Gaskin's report I enclose). Before daylight on the morning of the 8th the steam and pulling cutters, manned and armed, with Lieutenant Kirke in charge (Mr. Purdy, Gunner, being in charge of the st am cutter) proceeded to seize the boats of the Albin Ali, which resulted in seven of them being taken. One of these is a Bahrein boat which appears to have been detained at Zobarah by Shaikh Sultan against the wishes of the men. Ko opposition was made by any of the boats upon being seized, the creu's of some of them sailing their boats off to the ship. Just before leaving Zobarah a Turkish official visited the ship, bringing with him the letter which I enclose, and to which I made no reply. I left Zobarah at 11 a. m ., on the 8th instant with the captured boats in tow and arrived at Bahrein in the evening. These boats are being turned over to the Chief of Bahrein for safe custody. With reference to the letter received from the Turkish Mudir, I shall re main here pending a further communication from you. I have found Mr. Gaskin a great assistance during these proceedings.

This is to inform you that I am the bearer of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian G ulf to your address, and to request that you will8 * come on board the vessel under my command to receive it, and after reading the same to give me your reply.

Pelly , CornmanJer and Senior Naval Officer, Persiau Gulf Division, To— Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed-bin-Salamah. In consideration of the insulting manner in which you have received my letter to you, requesting you to visit me, I can but consider that you intend setting at defiance the orders of the British Government. I now forward you by Mr. Gaskin (Assistant llesident) the letter from the Political llesident iii the Persian Gulf, and if no answer is received from you within G hours of the receipt thereof, I shall commence active measures against you ordered by Government. Translation of Mohamed Rahim's letter to Sultan-bin-Salamah;.

After compliments. —I noted whatever you have written to me. Regard ing my visit on board, I am unable to do so under any circumstances, and also you ought to know that you have nothing to do to such extent. f rorn —The Mudir of Ojair , Agent to Mudir of Zobarah, To—Those Officers of the British Government and also the Assistant who may see this. Should you enquire especially concerning those persons composing the Albin-Ali (namely) Sultan-bin-Mohamed Salamah and his following, small or great, their residence is in the locality of Zobarah, which is (part) of the territories of the Turkish Government under the jurisdiction of Katr and the property of the Sultan, who is our Sultan, and the foresaid tribe have come under the protection of the (Ottoman) Government. It {i .e., the foregoing statement) should be known, and they {i .e., Albin-Ali) should experience no injustice at your hands. I am Seyel Mohamed Paouf, Mudir of Ojair and Agent of the Mudir of Zobarah. Above me (there is) a Kaim Makara, above whom there exists a Mutasarrif (named) Ibrahim Eoozi Pasha. It is necessary for me to furnish information ; if, therefore, you entertain any action, inform me that I may place the information before the Kaim Makam and the Mutasarrif. This (your action) is not in accordance with the customs of Governments which have formed laws and policies, and you have acted in opposition to (international) laws and policies.I am sending you Corporal Haji Abdullah, and my desire is that you should inform me of your reasons and intentions. If you are desirous of obtaining replies, it is not necessary to come in a man-of-war and enter (the waters of) Zobarah. Zobarah is a part of Katr and is the property of the Turkish Government and our Sultan Abdul Hamad Khan. If you desire to seize Sultan-bin-Mohamed and take him on board, you have no right to do so, and regarding your contention in that the Albin-Ali are subjects to Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali, I have true information that they are of the inhabitants of Katr from ancient days, from grandfather to son. Your vessel should not remain in the harbour of Z aba rah and, may it please God, that on the receipt of my letter to you, you will depart. I shall refer to my Government and you should refer to yours. You have taken those vessels which were in the harbour, in some of which there are (some) pearls, shells, etc. I do not understand your desires {i .e., actions), and this is contrary to (all) laws and usages ; and if you have any reason for the same, negotiate with me and receive my reply and prevent your commit ting these injustices. If any of them (i.e., boats) disappear and anything lost therefrom, you are answerable. At present Sultan is sick and is unable to send you a reply; let this be your reply. You have no right to act contrary to custom, and on your receiving this letter you should inform me what are your intentions. Dated Zobarah, the 8th July 1895, From—J. C. G askin , Esq, Extra Assistant to the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf, To— C aptain J. H. P elly , R.N., H. M. S. Sphinx. I have the honour to report that in compliance with your request I pro ceeded to Zobarah, taking with me the Residency Agent of Bahrein and Abdul Rahman -bin-Abdul Wahab, Vizier to the Chief of Bahrein, and beg to give, in detail, all that took place on that occasion. On our arrival at the town of Zobarah I ordered your Interpreter to go and ascertain the locality of Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed-bin-Salamah's residence, and to inform Shaikh Sultan to the effect that I was the bearer of a letter from you, which I desired to deliver to him personally. When the Interpreter landed he was met by two Turkish soldiers, one of whom is a Corporal in that service. They prevented the Interpreter to hold any communication with the natives, and told him that Shaikh feultan was in a state unfit to receive any one, and Shaikh Sultan s son, together with Ivhalifah bin-Mubarak, one of the headmen of the Albin-Ali, were with the Turkish- Mudir; he therefore must go to the Mudir's quarters if he desired to meet them. Anticipating that some unnecessary delay may be caused by the intrigue of the Mudir, we landed and went direct to the hut in which Shaikh Sultan receives visitors. On the way there we were met by the two soldiers, who informed us that the Mudir desired us to go to him as we had no business to interview any one prior to visiting him and informing him of the cause of our presence in Zobarah. I requested the Corporal to convey my ^ compliments to the Mudir and inform him that as his presence in Zobarah is not recognised, there was no necessity of my calling upon him. I also ordered the Interpreter to go to the Mudir's quarters and inform Shaikh Sultan's son that I desired him to come to me. The Interpreter, finding only Khalifah-bin-Mubarak with the Mudir, con veyed my message to him, with which message Khalifah-bin-Mubarak com plied. 910 I informed Khalifah-bin-Mubarak that there was an urgent necessity for my seeing Shaikh Sultan-hin-Mahomed-bin-Salamali with as little delay as possible, and if he was too ill to leave his bed, I would be glad to go to him. After a delay of nearly half an hour, I requested the Residency Agent to proceed to Shaikh Sultan's residence, which was only a few yards oft', with the same message, and after his having gone a few paces in that direction he was promptly stopped by the two soldiers and ordered not to proceed another step. I got up to go to Shaikh Sultan's house, and on nearing the soldiers was in a like manner stopped, and on insisting to proceed, they seized me by the arms and informed me that 'the Mutasarrif had given orders to the elfect that no one should see Shaikh Sultan. I therefore must not attempt to act contrary to the orders of the Turkish Government. I told them that I could not recognise those orders and must obey mine at any cost; they therefore had better make way. They however would not listen and attempted to force me back, where upon I drew out my whistle for the purpose of calling for assistance. The soldiers quickly interpreted my action and released me before I could whistle, and the Corporal went to give information to the Mudir, whilst the other stood aside. It appeared to me that the Mudir would recognise my determination to fulfil my orders at any cost, and it was likely that he would place no further obstacles. 1 therefore thought it fit to wait a little before making another attempt which might lead to some undesirable results. On the Mudir receiving the Corporal's story, he came out and asked the second soldier why he had been making such a row and forthwith despatched the Corporal to Shaikh Sultan's house. Shortly after this occurrence Shaikh Sultan and Khalifah-bin-Mubarak appeared, and I told the former that as I wished to see him privately, I desired the absence of the Mudir; and in compliance with the same he requested the Mudir to retire. After the retirement of the Mudir T personally delivered your letter to gether with that from Colonel A\ r ilson to Shaikh Sultan, informing him that I sincerely hoped he would show his good sense by giving agreeable replies to both letters. Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed-bin-Salamah read the two letters in my pre sence, and their contents caused him to behave in a manner contrary to his usual habits, and he talked big, stating that he was no slave or subject to Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali, and though he could not contend against the power of the British Government, no force or action on their part would compel him to return to Bahrein; that both he and Shaikh Jasim-bin-Mahomed-bin-Thani had a few days previously written to Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali on this subject, and private negotiations were more likely to lead to their conciliation than threats from the British Government, with whom he has nothing to do. The Mudir here returned and Shaikh Sultan became more offensive, threatening both the Residency Agent and the Vizier, adding that they were the cause of his misfortune and trouble with the British Government. He then turned round on me and told me that if the man-of-war was to wait for a month, he would not send replies to the two letters : I therefore had better not wait any longer. Seeing further negotiations of no avail, and Shaikh Sultan being disposed to set the orders of the British Government at defiance, and disregard your letter, I thought it fit not to prolong my visit beyond this and returned to H. M. S. Sphinx, I may add that when Sheikh Sultan made an appearance, he was not in the condition as reported by the Turkish soldiers to the Interpreter. No. 3—S.Z., dated Bushire, the 10th July 1895.

Jq continuation of my telegram of ^Letie'-f'omeomm.nac 1 -, Syiiix.d.ied Utbjui, tlle 24th instant, I havethe hononr to Letter from Commander, Sphinx, dated 17th July forward, foi'tke information of Govern- 'utter from romm.nder. Sphinx, dated 23rd jdy ment, copy of the correspondence cited in 1895, with enclosures. the margin. 2. I can hardly believe it possible that such an attack as Commander Pelly conceives might be brought about by Shaikh Jasim on Bahrein should be at tempted. Having regard to the intimate part which has been openly taken by the local Turkish authorities in the affairs of Albin-Ali, such an attack would seem to involve full Turkish responsibility for an overt act of hostility which can scarcely be apprehended. 3. The capture of nine more of the Albin-Ali boats reported to have been effected on 15th July seemed to offer a prospect of some result. Salim-bin- Hamad, who was in one of these boats, was after arrival at Bahrein reconciled with the Chief, and appeared to welcome the opportunity of a return to his for mer position. Boats provided by the Bahrein Chief were accordingly sent to Zobarah to bring over the family and followers of Salim, who holds a high place in the Albin-Ali tribe, and such others as might be willing to return. One of these boats returned at once, reporting that the rest, nine in number, had been de tained by the newly-appointed Turkish Mudir. This action by, or directly in the presence and with the countenance of, the local Turkish authority, makes the situation more serious, and I would request that I may be favoured with the instructions of Government upon it. 4. Besides Shaikh Jasim's letter of the 10th July to me, which has not been answered, he has written several to the Bahrein Chief. They are full ofconventional verbiage and are in my opinion not worthy of any confidence. His statement in the letter to me that Mr. Gaskin had drawn a pistol upon Shaikh Sultan on the 7th July is a deliberate falsehood. In a subsequent letter to the Chief he took a different tone, excusing Shaikh Sultan for not having received the visit in a proper manner, and saying that he had censured him lor it, though ' no blame can be attached to a man whose mind has been affected by illness.' Altogether in Shaikh J-asim's letter there is a somewhat unintelli gible mixture of protest, profession, and appeal. After writing the above I have received your telesram of this day, in timating that Lawrence should be sent to obtain further information. Dated the 17tli Moharrum 1313 — 10th July 1895. From —Jasim bin-Mohambd Thani, to Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After compliments.—Whan. I learnt the news of the arrival of the man -pr- war, and knowing that Sultan (bin-Mohamed Salamah) was ill, 1 started with the obiect of meeting the Captain,.the Assistant and Khahd (hin-Ali). I ia scarcely reached Zobarah when I learnt that they had suddenly landed there an frightened the people of the country by (a demonstration of) armed boats, and that the Assistant had landed with a drawn revolver at Sultan (bin-Mohamed Salamah); but they (Sultan and his people would appear to be meant) avoided them by good means. Afterwards they (armed boats) disturbed the (peace of the) sea and seized the boats belonging to the poor and humble striving to earn their livelihood, together with the unopened oyster shells they had on board and all then property. The Albin-Ali tribe did not leave Bahrein, bot on account of the humili ation which they experienced : they have not been rebels. I stood guarantee for them to Shaikh Esa (assuring him) that no mischief would arise from the side of Zobarah or from its inhabitants, and they have committed no offence. They are poor who earn their livelihood : they are not slaves. Their original domicile was Katr and they resided in Fareybah and Zobarah, and tlience removed to Hawaylah and £1-Bidaa. They have not been ruled as slaves. This proceeding (which has been undertaken against them) is contrary to your (sense of) justice, and is a wrong unbecoming of you. They have no knowledge of their own affairs : these are known to God and then to me. Dated Ras Lufan, the 14th July 1895. prom Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander and Senior Naval OfTicer, To Colonel F. W. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 10th instant, received per R I.M.S Lawrence on the forenoon of the 12th, and to thank you for placing that ship at my disposal for a time. In comoliance with your letter I left Bahrein at 8 a.m . on the 13th, R.I.M.S. Lawrence in company, and proceeded to Zobarah, anchoring oil that place at 2 p.m. the same day. I found all the boats, about 11 in num. )er, hauled up on the beach, and therefore did not think it expedient to attempt their seizure. Durino- my stay at Zobarah I received two letters from Jasim -bin-Mohamed Thani, asking for an interview on behalf of Shaikh Sultan who was sick, to both of which I replied stating that he could come off to the ship if he desired to see me. This, however, ho would not do. A copy of this correspondence is attached. 1314 I am also forward in you a letter, under flying seal, received through the Bahrein Resident Agent from the same source, which has been duly translated by Mr. Gaskin, and from the tone of which it would appear that Jasirn-bin- Thani intends to support the Albin-Ali against whatever proceedings may he taken in their coercion. According to news received from a messenger from Uoweis, Jasim advises that the pearling licet should proceed to the banks oil El-Bidda. This messenger also stated that Jasim has sent a letter to the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa, reporting my proceedings. From a letter received from Ja^im, Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali is of opinion that he may agitate the Beni-Hajar tribes to make an attack on Bahrein Island. While off Zobarah several Bedouin tents and camels were seen, which were not there on our first visit. These appear to be the levies sent by Jasim- bin-Mohamed Thani to help the Albin -iUi. Hearing nothing further from Jasim-bin-Thani, I left Zobarah at 8 a. m. this morning, Lawrence in company, and proceeded round the Katr Penin sula as far as Has Lufan. We passed two small batches of boats, which proved to be boats belonging to subjects of Shaikh Esa, and also two larger batches which we stopped to inspect, and which also turned out to be Bahrein's boats. I could gather no information from either of these boats as to the place where the boats of the Albin-Ali are pearl-diving. I am anchored off Has Lufan for the night and shall proceed in the morning down the coast in search of the Albin-Ali boats. My intention is, if possible, to be at Bahrein on Tuesday evening or Wed nesday morning- Dated Bahrein, the 17th July 1895. From—C aptain J. H. P elly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To— C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that on the 15th instant, I came upon a number of boats engaged in pearl-diving, nine of which were boats of the Albin- Ali, which I seized and towed to Bahrein, turning them over to the Chief of Bahrein as before. In one of them was Salim-bin-Hamad, the originator of this disturbance, and it is hoped that a reconciliation may now be arrived at between him and the Bahrein Chief. Dated Bahrein, the 23rd July 1895. From—C aptain J. H. P elly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To— C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With respect to the further situation of affairs here I have the honour to - report as follows— On the morning of the 20th Mr. Gaskin reported to me that Khalifah-bin- Jasim, son of Jasim-bin-Thani, had arrived at Bahrein, bearing a letter from his father to Sheikh Esa to the effect that he (Jasim) would be responsible for the evacuation of Zobarah by Shaikh Sultan within 12 to 15 days, also that the tribe should be allowed to return. Khalifa-bin-.lasim also requested an inter view with Mr. Gaskin, which was granted. I requested Mr. Gaskin to inform him, for the information of his father, that if a letter from Shaikh Sultan pro mising his return with his following to Bahrein within 12 days is received within four days, the matter will be considered; but*if no answer is forthcom ing within that time, further action will be at once taken against those of the Albin-Ali who continue to disobey the orders of Government. I gave permission for Sheikh Esa to send back to Zobarah Salim bin- Hamad and people taken in boats, that they may bring their families to Bahrein. Amicable arrangement has been arrived at between Sheikh Esa and Salim-bin-IIamad.On the evening of the 21st Shaikh Esa despatched 5 boats to Zobarah, and another 5 yesterday morning, for the purpose of conveying Salim's family and such of his followers who may decide to return to their homes at Bahrein, and yesterday evening intelligence was received here respecting the detention of nine of these boats at Zobarah by Mahomed Effendi, the newly-appointed Mudir at that place ; also that the tribesmen have been w r arned by him against returning to Bahrein. With reference to this T am sending him a letter demanding an explana tion, a copy of which I enclose. It is also stated that Ibrahim Eoosi Pasha, the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa, is collectinir levies, but for wiiat purpose is yet unknown, and that he has in structed Jasim-bin-Thani to send reinforcements to Zobarah. A letter has bpen received by a Banyan from Katif to the effect that it has been suggested by Mahomed Abdul Wahab to the Mutasarrif of Kl-llasa that he should prohibit the landing of British subjects there, as they are suspected of being there for the purpose of spying upon their movements. It is reported that the Turkish gunboat Zuhaf arrived at Katif on the 21st with the newly-appointed Kaim Makam of that place on board; her future movements are unknown. Seeing all the difficulties in the way, I consider that it would be advisable to telegraph for another man-of-war to be sent up the Gulf for the protection of Bahrein in case of attack. As matters stand at present, I deem it necessary that I should remain handy to Bahrein, and consider that your presence here is highly desirable. Dat.pcl Balirein, the 23rd July 1895. From— Captain J. H. Pklly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To—M ahomed Effrndi at Zobarah. Hearing that you are detaining nine boats belonging to the Shaikh of Bahrein, who is on friendly terms with the British Government, and Zobarah being one of the towns belonging to him, also the Albin-Ali being his subjects, I demand that you will inform me by what authority you are detaining these Bahrein boats which were sent to Zobarah for the purpose of conveying those of the Albin-Ali who desire to return to Bahrein and to their allegiance to their Chief. No Turkish authority is recognised by the British Government at Zobarah. Enclosure in letter No. 37 of the 12th July 1395, frrm the Secretary, Political and Secret Department, India Office. No. 401, dated Therapia, the 22nd June 1895. From— S ir P. C urrie, To—T he E arl of K imberley. On the receipt of Your Lordshin's despatch No. 206 of the 30th ultimo, I lost no time in informing the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the rumoured intention of the Albin-Ali tribe to form a settlement at Zobarah on the Persian Gulf with the support of the Turkish Mutasarrif of Hasa. I caused it to be poined out to His Excellency, who appeared to have no knowledge of the question, that the position of Great Britain with regard to Bahrein was perfectly well known to the Porte, and referred him to the Embassy's note verhnle, of which a copy was forwarded to the Foreign Office in Sir C. Ford's No. 318 of 15th November 1802. An aide-memoire on the subject was left with His Excellency. Telegram dated Simla, the 9th August 1895. From—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, To—The Naval Commander-in-Chief. Another vessel will probably be required for duty in the Persian Gulf in addition to the Sphinx. The Government of India would be glad if the IHassy or, if this is inconvenient, some other vessel were held in readiness. 1516 No. 735, dated Simla, the 9tli Aug-ust 1895.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Sphinx requires coal, but absence probably cause panic. Situation Bahrein more menacing. Another ship desirable in my own opinion. No. 77, dated Bushire, 3rd August 1895. ir rom Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. 'With reference to vour telegram of 2/th July, and in continnation of my telegram of yesterday's date, I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, that I despatched the R. I. M. S. Lawrence to Bahrein on the 28th July to obtain the further information desired regarding the apprehension of an attack on Bahrein, for which some grounds had been indicated in reports which had reached me. 1 enclose copy of Commander Pelly's report of the 30th July, and of its enclosures 2. The information now available does not lead me to modify the opinion expressed in my letter No. 75 of the 27th July, and I do not regard an attack on Bahrein as at present probable. The rumoured collection of levies by the Mutasarrif of El-llasa can hardly be taken, in my opinion, to imply a threat of overt hostility, and the same may be said ot Shaikh Jasim s reported prepaia- tions, as in all the circumstances of the case his act would be tantamount to the direct action of the Turkish authorities. The local representatives of Tur kish authority are, however, described as an irresponsible class of officials on whose discretion no reliance can be placed. 3. It will be seen that Syed Raouf Effendi, acting for the Mudir of Zobarah, does not, in his reply, directly meet Commander Felly's demand for an explana tion of the detention of the Bahrein boats on the 22ud July. His letter, however, amounts to an acceptance of responsibility tor the act, and my information is that the boats were boarded by Turkish soldiers, the sails and gear being removed. 4. It has already been reported that Salim-bin-Hamad, after reaching Bahrein with the boats captured on the loth July, was readily reconciled with the Bahrein Chief, mutual engagements being executed. Salim is a relative of the late Ksa-bin-Tarif, head of the Albin-Ali tribe, who died about a year and a half aso. The llesidency Agent reports that the Chief has now appointed him in succession to the late head of the tribe, and that the appointment will be welcomed by the tribe, who will prefer him to Saikh Sultan. Salim has begged that his boats mav be allowed to go pearling, so that he and his immediate followers may be spared the loss caused by the stoppage of these operations. I am authorizing the grant of his request, considering this to be a just as well as a politic measure. 5. The Turkish corvette or gunboat Zuhaf, reported as having arrived at Katif with reliefs on the 21st July^ is now stated to-be at Zobarah. I regret to report the receipt of an intimation of the death on 27^1 July, from heat appolexy, of Chief Engineer J. N. Midgeby of II. M. S. Sphinx. Dated Bahrein, the 3Uth July 1895. ir rom —Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To—Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In accordance with your letters Nos. 53 and 397, dated 27th instant, I have the honour to acquaint you as follows :— The latest intelligence received by the Chief of Bahrein is to the effect that Jasim -bin-Mahomed-Thani has issued orders to all the Albin -Ali pearl- in'- fleet to return to Zobarah, and he has also ordered the launching of all the available boats that are at Zobarah. lie has issued orders to his following and to Nasir -bin-Mubarak to be present at Zobarah.17 Threatening letters have also been received by Shaikh Esa and his son from Jasira, showing his animosity towards him. These letters are being forwarded to you by the Agent of this place. I also enclose the reply to my letter to the Turkish official at Zobarah, from the tenour of which it appears that the Albin-Ali are receiving every support from the Turks. The Shaikh of the Nairn tribe at Bahrein has received a letter from Jasim, demanding that he should either leave Bahrein with his following for Katr or send boats to convey all the cattle he has at Katr back to Bahrein. The Turkish gun vessel Zuhaf is now at Zobarah. It has also been reported to me that an atrocious and daring act of piracy and attempted murder of a British Indian subject has taken place about 6 miles below Katif within sight of the shore on the 26th instant about 9 a.m. The perpetrator of this outrage is a Bedouin by name Ahmad-bin-Salman, cousin to Nasir-bin-Mubarak. The victim, a banyan, had his right hand cut com pletely off from the wrist. The doctor's report upon him to me I enclose. I shall most probably leave here to-morrow or Thursday for a cruise round the coast. Translation of Utter received from Say id Mahomed Raouf Ejfendi [Mudir of Ojair and Agent of the Mudir of Zobarah), to Commanier Pelly, II. M. S. ' Sphinx,' dated the 26th July 1895. Your letter dated 23rd July 1895 received, and I have understood what you have written. 'With reference to the nine boats that you sent to convey the families of those of the inhabitants of Zobarah, whom you have captured by force from under the flag of the Commander of the Faithful and Sultan of the Unitarians, the said families are the subjects of the High Government from ancient days and for ever, and they only settled at Zobarah by the orders of the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa. Both you and Mr. Gaskin have committed injustices beyond rules and friendship in taking boats belonging to the people of Zobarah, goods being in them to the value of 5 lakhs of dollars, and the owners firstly under the protec tion of God and secondly under the High Ottoman Government. You have also prevented them from following their occupation. So far you have caused loss to all boats belonging to the people of Katr which have reached your side. Also you have seized the boats which you have found belonging to the people of Zobarah, though they have not sinned ; and no one has any claims against them except that they have come under the shadow of the Commander of the Faithful and the protection of the High Ottoman Government. Let it not be hidden from you that Bahrein is under Katr, also Katr and Bahrein are part of the domains of the High (Ottoman) Government. The origi nal persons who took Bahrein from its people were of the inhabitants of Katr. Al-Khalifah were merchants from Koweit and strangers to them. They were only four persons and were appointed Agent over Bahrein; also paid tithes and taxes to Katr and to Bin-Saood, the Sultan's officer. Differences arose between them and Bahrein. Then flew the flag of the High Ottoman Government. You falsely represented (matters) to the high Government in support of your claim of protection over them. This not satisfying you, you have exercised false aggression towards the people of Katr, taking all their boats and goods, also imprisoning (some of) their people, though they are under the protection of God and that of the Commander of the Faithful, the successor to the prophet of God of the world. You have committed all these great actions against them. It is evident from what is known that the Commander of the Faithful will directly over throw your authority in Bahrein, and support her against you and others.Dated Bahrein, the Wth July 1895. From —S urgeon F. B radshaw, To—The Commander, H- M. S. Sphinx. I have the honour to suhmit to you the following report of the injuries sustained by the Banyan named Tikchand Dewairgados. His ri-ht hand was completely severed above the wrist, exposing both hones of the forearm, and he had a large incised wound extending from the lower an-le of the scapula across the back of the shoulder, terminating about the inaction of middle and upper third of the arm : this wound is about 1 inch deep. There is also a smaller wound on the back about 8 inches long and a inch deep When I visited him he was very much exhausted from the shock and loss of hemorrhage; and as no attempt had been made to dress the wounds, there was extensive suppuration from them, especially from the sword cuts in the shoulder. I amputated the forearm a little above the lower third consi dering the shock and loss of blood and the extensive suppuration from the sword wounds, I think he is in a very critical condition.

W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to report, for the information of the Government of India, that the intimation and warning conveyed in your confidential teleo-ram of the 4th instant, have been communicated to the Turkish representative at Zobarah, through the Commander of H.M.S. 'Sphinx.' 2. From Commander Felly's report of the 6th instant, of which I enclose a copy, it will be seen that the Turkish assumption of control of the situation and intervention in the affairs of the Albin-Ali, have become very pronounced It would appear that the Turkish flag has been given to the Zobarah boats and 20Iliat tbeir moveincnts are controlled. I umlersfand that Commander Pally has some doubt of the efficacy of further proceedings against the Albin-Ali, ovvinir to the Turks having taken matters into their own hands. In my opinion, however, the hoisting of the Turkish flag on a boat of that tribe, need in no way be held to demand a recognition that such boat is rightfully under the protection of that Government, or to bar a seizure. Meantime the nine boats sent from Bahrein for the conveyance to that place from Zobarah, of the family and followers of Shaikh Salim-bin-Hamad, remain in detention at Zobarah. It is desirable, I venture to submit, that these should be forcibly recovered, failing compliance with a demand for their release. Commander Pelly has not, however, stated that he has information whether the boats are in a position to be readily recovered and may not be prepared to undertake the operation with the means at his disposal. 3. I would request special reference to the report that II. M.S. Sphinx will very shortly require coal, and that it will be necessary for her to return to Bushire to obtain it about the 20th instant. Though service at the present moment in these seas, is, and brobably will be, for at least four weeks to come, a very severe trial for a European crew, I would hesitate to recom mend even a temporary withdrawal of all protection, and the means of enfor cing our authority, from Bahrein at the present juncture. Information has constantly reached me that extreme uneasiness and alnrm prevail among the inhabitants, and that people have in consequence left the place. While con sidering therefore, as I have already reported, that in all the present circum stances, an attack is not seriously to be apprehended, it would, in my opinion, be imprudent, having regard to the state of local feeling, to leave the place without the support ot; a visible evidence of our power. I would accordingly submit, for the consideration of Government, that another war vessel should be sent. 4. I have been unable to get any infornation of a second Turkish gun boat having been sent to Zobarah as mentioned by Commander Pelly. X hardly think it possible that there should be a second vessel, unless such should have come from some place beyond the Gulf. Dated Bahrein, the 6th August 1895. p rom — Captain J. H. Telly , Conmiander and Senior Naval Officer, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. I have the honuor to inform you that I left this port on the 31st July and proceeded to Zobarah arriving there the same day. The Turkish gun-vessel Zuhofvt&amp;s there on our arrival, and the Captain informed me that his orders were to await the arrival of the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa, whom he expected daily, and in the meantime to keep off any threatened attack on Bahrein. He also said that his spies had reported to him that there were 14,000 men armed with Martini -Henry rifles about four hours* walk inland. A Bahreini who swam off to the ship at Zobarah, stated that Jassim had with him just outside Zobarah about 50 of his following and that the report about the 14,000 men was incorrect. I left Zobarah on the morning of the 2nd instant, and proceeded to the pearl- banks off Has Lufan and upon nearing a batch of boats, several of them made for the shore, and as it was blowing fresh and I was unable to overtake them, I fired, a blank charge and in response one of them hoisted Turkish colors. There is no doubt from the evidence of the natives on board at* the time that these boats belong to Zobarah, and this coincides with the report I heard that all Zobarah boats have been supplied with a Turkish flag. The Zuhaf visited boats at Fasht-al Debel on Saturday, and asked whether there were any Bahrein boats there, and upon being informed there were none, they ordered the Zobarah boats not to leave that position for three days, when they would be further communicated with. I have forwarded the reply to the Turkish Mudir of Zobarah, in accordance with your memorandum dated 21^th instant. It is reported that another Turkish gun-boat has arrived at'Zoharah. I shall shortly be requiring coal, and it will he necessary for me to proceed to Bushire in about 14 days' time for this purpose. Telegram No. 1630-E., dated Simla, the 26th August 1895.

Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegram of yesterday, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of Commander Telly's report of the 14th instant and enclosure. 2. I have previously expressed the view that notwithstanding the very disturbing rumours that have been rife, a serious attack on Bahrein could 22Imrdly be believed to be possible, my main reason for tbis opinion being that such an attack must be held to involve nothing short of the fullest responsibi lity of the Turkish Government. It has, however, been urged by Mr. Gaskin, Extra Assistant Resident, who went to Bahrein with 11. M. S. Sphinx last month, and has since remained there, that having regard to attempts by Jasirn to tamper with the loyalty of some of Shaikh Esa's people, a destructive outbreak might be brought about. This could be effected, it is urged, by a comparatively small party of Jasim's people, or of the wilder Bedouin element intiuenced by him, which being joined by some of those on the Idand on landing, might work considerable mischief, Jasimmeantime counting on escaping responsibility by throwing the blame on Shaikh Esa's own people. 3. Yesterday I had the opportunity of closely questioning Agha Mohamed Bahim, who had just arrived by the mail, having attended ^lr, Gaskin on the spot for more than a month past, and who having long served us as Residency Agent at Bahrein, is familiar with the surrounding people and local feeling. He regards Jasim—ostensibly holding the important office of Kaim Makam of Katr under the Ottoman Government—as an utterly unscrupulous, reckless, and irresponsible character with an unlimited faculty for intrigue, lie holds the tiimest conviction that Jasim is at heart thoroughly inimical to Turkish authority, and declares the secret aim and object of that restless adventurer to be a rupture between Great Britain and the Porte, whh the result of a severe blow to the prestige of the latter in these parts. Jasim would thereupon throw off his very uncertain allegiance to the Ottoman Government, and openly defying its authority, as he did some three years ago, when he inflicted a serious reverse on a Turkish force, would make common cause with the Fouler of Nejd, and trust to making his peace with us by plausible excuses and sub mission. An obvious difficulty as regards the above views at once suggests itself, that the Turkish authorities would hardly lend themselves so readily and com pletely as their recent action implies, to such designs of Jasim. To this Agha Mohamed Rahim replies that the Porte is profoundly ignorant of the actual facts and true situation as regards a remote part of its territory, and is most ill- served by its local officers, who supply the most false and self-interested information. 4. In the above premises there is, in my opinion, much truth, certainly so with regard to the character attributed to Jasim, and the ignorance and weak ness of the Ottoman Government in these parts. But upon the conclusion, attri buting a definite and somewhat complex design to Jasim, it is not possible without further evidence to form an opinion. It does not however seem necessary to fathom the true projects of Jasim in the very active intrigues to which he lias committed himself : it will suffice to recognise the fact that he is perfectly unscrupulous and reckless of responsibility, and thus some colour is given to the constant rumours and universal fears of an attack .on Bahrein which might otherwise bs lightly regarded. The balance of probability is still, in my opinion, against such an attempt, but the very general alarm prevailing—our subjects being reported as carrying their valuables for safety to the Agency—is in itself mischievous, and I have accordingly thought it right to urge the desirability of the presence of another man-of-war. 5. In my telegram of yesterday I have also ventured to recommend the adoptron of stronger measures, and in this connection I enclose a translation of the Bahrein Chief's letter to me concerning the seizure and detention of his boats sent to Zobarah to bring over the family and followers of Shaikh Salim-bin-Hamad, who had made his peace with Shaikh Esa. This incident was most unfortunate as encouraging resistance and strengthening the influence for mischief of Jasim. I would suggest' therefore, as a first step, that should another man-of-war be sent up, these boats should be forcibly recovered after despatch of an ultimatum, subject to the opinion of the Senior Naval Officer on the practicability of the operation. And with regard to doubts which, I understand. Commander Pelly lias as to the warrant tor the seizure of Albin-Ali boats, now wearing the Turkish flag, it appears to me that the recent grant of the flag, by possibly irresponsible local 23authorities, should not bar the operations which had previously been under taken. 6. I would request the favour of instructions upon Commnnder Felly's enquirv as to his discretion in firing upon a lleet ol boats apparently hostile, though under Turkish colours, to which I referred in my telegram of yesterday. And in this connection I would report that a request ot Shaikh l^sa ior per mission to equip a boat to follow up the perpetrator of the two cases o£ piracy that have been reported has been refused, to avoid giving any sort of excuse for acts of violence by native craft. It is alleged, however, that Ahmad-bin- Salman who committed the two acts of piracy has Turkish countenance, in his proceedings. Dated Bahrein, the Hth August 1895. p rom Captain J. H. Telly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, To— Colonkl F. A, Wilson , Political Rosidont in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my letter dated 8th instant, I have the honour to further inform you as follows : — Intelligence has been received that on Thursday last a pearling boat be- longimr to Shaikh Esa was captured by the pirate Ahmad-bin-Salman on the west side of Fasht-al-Debel. A copy of my letter sent to the Commander of the Zuhaf reporting this matter I enclose for your information. News has also been received to the effect that two days after the receipt of a reply to the Mutasarrif's telegram to Constantinople with reference to Zobarah affairs, he collected a large following of Arabs and Turkish troops at a well named Brer Nejim, situated outside El-Hasa, and has given out that he intends going to Nejd, but I consider this doubtful as the nearest water-supply there is seven days' journey. Several of Jasim's boats are collected off Wakrah and messenger boats are calling in all the Katr boats to the same place. A messenger boat has also been despatched by Jasim to call in the Aibin-Ali boats. It seems to be the general opinion here that Jasim is now determined to make the attack, and in anticipation of this Shaikh Esa is calling in his pearling fleet. I request to be informed whether, in the event of my meeting at sea a fleet of boats apparently hostile sailing under JLurkish colours, I am authorised in firing on the same without or within the three mile limit of the Katr coasts. I consider that another man-of-war is urgently needed here ; for if an attack is made under the direction of the Turks, I fear that the island will be taken on account of an insufficient garrison, another great weakness being the unsurveyed state of the south side of the island, thus preventing ships from having free action in those waters. Do you not under the circumstances consider that it would be advisable to have a small force of troops here for the protection ot Bahrein and i&gt;ritish prestige ? In case of my not beinj? able toccal shortly, I should propose that the Lawrence should be sent over to supply me. The boat that conveyed my letter to Zobarah has not yet returned. I am therefore proceeding to Zobarah to-morrow morning and shall probably anchor there for the night. Dated Bahrein, the 12th August 1895. p r om Captain J. H. P elly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, To —Commander Djemal Bey , Turkish Corvette Zuhaf. Information has reached me that an act of piracy has taken place on the west side of Fasht-al-Debel on Thursday evening last in the seizure of a 24Bahrein pearling boat by Ahmad-bin-Salraan, the same person who cut off the Land of a British Indian subject on the 26th July. It appears thnt he went alongside the pearling boat in a small boat with four men and threatened to kill any who offered resistance to him. He took pos session of the boat, turning its crew into the small boat and sailed the boat with all its contents towards the mainland. This man having taken re£ngc in territory under Turkish authority, I have the honour to request that he may be brought to justice for both these offences, and that the boat and contents be returned to the owner and compen sation made. I am reporting this serious act of piracy to the Home Government, and it is hoped that you will be able to suppress further aggressions of this kind. Dated 5th August 1896. From— Shaikh Esa , Chief of Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. After Compliments. —Let it not be hidden from you that on their arrival at Bahrein, Salim-bin-Hamad and his followers begged for protection and promised to bring their families and effects to Bahrein. In addition to the protection, assurances and honour were bestowed upon them. After this the 'Naib Sahib ' ordered ten boats to be sent to Zobarah to bring the families of these persons, and in compliance with these, instructions the boats were sent; but on their arrival at Zobarah Shaikh Jasim ordered the Turkish soldiers to seize them and they did so and hauled up the boats after removing the gear and sails, and for this reason I am very sad. I had sanguine hopes in God and the British Government. The Sphinx left for Zobarah, and I was anxiously expecting that she should take the necessary steps to release them from Jasim's hands. After the third day she returned, leaving them there in trouble. In the meantime two of the crew of thes^ boats escaped and came to me and represented the troubles, ill-treatment and the starvation to w r hich their comrades were subjected, and that the people of Zobarah would not pro vide them with anything. I have hopes in the kindness of Government that their grievances may lie looked into and they may be freed. I also beg to state that reliable information is constantly being received of Jasim's actions to cause disorder and his collecting a large number of villains from the Bedouins and others, and his intention to surprise Bahrein. He had dven out that he was waiting for an opportunity for this purpose, but I hope by the power of God and yours, he will be repelled in hopelessness.

The Political Resident proposes to reply that the fullest responsibility rests on Turkish ollicials. He also advises the release by force of Bahrein boats whose detention at Zobarah was reported in my telegram of the 27th July.

To The Secretary to the Governmeut of India, Foreign Department. 1 hove the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your two telegrams of the 22nd instant. The necessary communication has been made to Com mander Pelly regarding his action in the event of hostile demonstration against Bahrein. A copy of Commander Pelly's last despatch* received yesetrday is enclosed for the information of Government; no • Dated 22ud August with enclosure. event of importance has occurred during the week, and the situation appears to be not materially changed. Some signi ficance may, however, attach to the rumour of warnings to his subordinates by the Mutasarrif against an attack on Bahrein, as possibly indicating a caution from the Ottoman Government to its representatives, against acts that would more seriously compromise it. 2. Should there be truth in this rumour, the general position disclosed is in no w r ay improved, and is in my opinion exceedingly unsatisfactory. For the Mudir at Z^barah and the Commander of the Turkish vessel Zuhof having both declared Shaikh Jasim (presumably as Kaim Makam of Katr) their superior, the reported instructions to them, would indicate a confusion and uncertainty of authority, and a consequent irresponsibility in action, of a dan gerous character. In this connection, I have to report the further information which hns reached me, of a letter from the Mutasarrif of Hasa to Shaikh Esa, stating that in reply to his orders for the arrest of the pirate Ahmad-bin- Salman, he had learned that the man was a Bahreini. Such an apology, when the occasion demands the most strenuous efforts to arrest this ruffian, is an insult to reason, the man having left Bahrein for Turkish territory, where he has since resided, 18 months ago. 3. It seems to me so gravely open to doubt whether Jasim can rightly be regarded as a responsible officer of the Ottoman Government, and our position resulting from this doubt, and the attitude of the local Turkish officials gene rally, has become so unsatisfactory and indeed intolerable, that I venture to submit a course of action for consideration. I do this with the utmost diffidence, having regard to my ignorance of the views of the Government of Indiain communication with Her Majesty's Secretary of State on the whole question, and of the international considerations which, in their opinion, may be iDVolved. 1 would accordingly ask that rny suggestion be tfiken rather as one for a course which appears to me direct and practicable in the event of a decision to adopt extreme measures, than as distinct proposal in the existing circumstances. I would submit then that after such communication to the Porte as may be deemed fit Shaikh Jasim's relation to that Government should be ignored, and that in view of his. wanton association of himself with matters between Bahrein and a section of its disaffected people, and in pursuance of the deliberate warning addressed to him at the outset of the present difficulty, he should be directly dealt with. That an ultimatum should be addressed to him demanding the instant restoration of the Bahrein boats unwarrantably held in detention at Zobarah, and his withdrawal together with his followers and any Bedouins or others under his influence, from Zobarah and its immediate neigh bourhood, on pain of operations by force of arras to be directed against him on or after a given date, whatever might be decided, including Al-Bidaa. From a careful study of the chart, and my observation at a former visit to the locality, as well as from other sources of information, I have been led to the conclusion that Al-Bidaa is one of the few places on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, which is especially liable to effective naval attack without mili tary support. The presence of a detachment of Turkish troops is the only objection,—and that from a political rather than a military point of view, of which I am aware,—to operations against Al-Bidaa. These troops might be called upon to retire before the operations against Jasim. Zobarah is not so open to attack, owing to shoal water, but might nevertheless be probably effectively shelled from the sea. Dated Bahrein, the 22nd August 1895. From— Captain J. H.

I have the honour to further inform you as follows The messenger who took my letter concerning Shaikh Salim's family, was warned by the Commander of the Zuhafwoi to appear at Zobarah again, and in consequence Shaikh Esa thought it inadvisable to send my second letter there concerning the reported act of piracy. I have received an answer to my first letter, a copy of which I enclose, desirin' me in future to address the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa. It is reported that the pirate Ahmad-bin-Salman has seized a pearling boat belonging to Jasim's following. Authentic news has been received that the Zuhaf left Zobarah on the morning of the 19th and reached Katif on the following day. It is rumoured that the Mutasarrif has written to Jasim warning him ao-ainst attacking Bahrein, also to the Commander of the Zuhaf and to the Mudir to prevent Jasim in any attempt upon Bahrein. Shaikh Esa has received a letter from El-Hasa stating that the Mutasarrif has written to Nasir -bin-Mubarak, demanding the arrest of the pirate Ahmad- bin-Salman, but Nasir replied to the effect that this man is a Bahreini.

W ilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of telegraphic correspondence, I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, on the difficulty which has arisen at Bahrein in connection with an attempted settlement at Zobarah. 3. Early in March the Albin-Ali tribe, incensed at some violence done to one of their chief men by the brother of Sheikh Esa of Bahrein, talked of re moving to the Katr Peninsula. A few days later an attempt to seize some of the Albin-Ali concerned in a quarrel with certain goldsmiths led to a collision in which shots were exchanged and two men on each side were killed. Sheikh Sul- tan-bin-Mohamed Salamah, the head of the tribe, then left Bahrein with some of his leading men, and went in the first place to Roweis near the north point of the Katr Peninsula, whence the local Chief attempted ostensibly at least to arrange matters. Sheikh Sultan almost immediately got into communication with Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani, who also professedly exerted his good offices to settle the difference. There can, however, hardly be a doubt that Jasim, whether or no he fostered the quarrel from the beginning, very soon saw in it a means to further his own aims and to carry out a design which he has before attempted, of a settlement at Zobarah. 3. Accordingly, early in April a letter from the Bahrein Chief intimated that though he had not been seriously concerned at the ajienation of Sheikh Sultan^ the object now declared, of a settlement at Zobarah, was^ a serious menace and injury to his position at Bahrein. The Chief further said he could turn the in truders out by force if thought advisable. I then reported the matter to Govern ment by telegram ; and upon the receipt of the instructions contained in your telegram of the 21st April, requested the Commander of H. M.S. Bramble to proceed to Bahrein with Mr. Gaskin, Assistant to the Resident, in order to communicate to Sheikh Jasim the warning which I had been directed to convey to him. I enclose for reference copy, in translation, of my letter to Sheikh Jasim, and of a letter which I thought it advisable to address to Sheikh Sultan. The Bramble sailed on 22nd and returned on the evening of the 26th with Sheikh Sultan's reply to my letter, and the Information which Lieutenant Commander Currey and Mr. Gaskin had been able to obtain. Sheikh Jasim being in the interior at some days' distance from Zobarah, his answer only reached me by mall on the 1st May. 'Copies, In translation, of these two letters are en* closed for reference. 4. The position as gathered from further reports of the Residency Agent by the mail, supplementing the information brought by H. M. S. Bramble, has become somewhat complicated. My instructions to Mr. Gaskin, apart from the warnings he was to convey, were to use every endeavour to induce the Sheikh of Bahrein and Sheikh Sultan to accept his good offices towards a reconciliation. These instructions were carried out by Mr. Gaskin with care and judgment, but unfortunately with little result, owing probably to the outside influences at work. Sheikh Sultan refused to return to Bahrein immediately, except practi cally under compulsion, which would have been useless. He stated that it was only after leaving Bahrein that on his appeal to Sheikh Jasim, and on the latter's invitation, he went to Zobarah; and at his 'desire that he had raised the Turk ish flag there, which, however, he agreed to remove: it had, in fact, ceased to fly before the Bramble left. Sheikh Esa evidently considered that Sheikh Sultan had too far identified himself with the enemies of Bahrein to return to his allegi ance. He declined to accept a condition of his return which Sheikh Sultan had proposed, mz. —that the tribe should be allowed a separate habitat at El-Had, a village a few miles from the Chief's headquarters; holding that this would be fatal to his own authority and would facilitate the designs of Sheikh Jasim and his enemies to usurp his authority and ultimately overthrow his rule. He accord- ingly preferred that Sheikh Sultan and his tribe should sever their connection from Bahrein altogether. v3 5. Important later news is that a few days after the departure of H. M. S. Bramble the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa arrived with the intention of taking the mail steamer to Busrah; but on learning the state ot affairs, and being met by a letter from jasim, he abandoned that design and proceeded instead at once to Zobarah. Jasim's letter is said to have informed the Mutasarrif of the purport of the warning he had received from me, and added that the removal of settlers at Zobarah was a matter for the Turkish authorities; that it was desirable to raise the Turkish flag, and that he awaited the arrival of the Mutasarrif there. It is further reported by the Residency Agent that information had reached him that representatives of the Manasir and Beni-Hajir tribes had visited Sheikh Sultan, had received valuable presents, and had entered into compacts to support him. 6. Sheikh Sultan in his letter asks for delay in obeying the order for his removal at the close of the pearl season. Such delay is, in my opinion, quite inadmissible : it is not justified by any necessity of the situation, and can only be intended to afford time for consolidating the position and for the operation of intrigues to secure its permanence. I regard his expressed jreadiness to be reconciled with his Chief as empty words, and consider that he now feels himself too much enmeshed in the intrigues of Jasim and others to return to his former position under Bahrein. Should he thoroughly realize that his aspirations for a settlement at Zobarah, supported by Jasim and local Chiefs, with possibly Turkish connivance, are hopeless, his attitude might very probably change. Sheikh Jasim's letter is evidently merely an evasion, and his pretence of looking for our assistance in proceedings which he well knows to be directly opposed to the policy of Government, is curiously bold. By the ' owners to whom he proposes to leave Katr, he must be taken to mean the Turks. 7. Bahrein trade has increased, and to this fact may probably be attributed the movement with regard to Zobarah, which now threatens to assume more importance. A settlement there fostered by Jasim's machinations, with possibly higher support, is regarded by Sheikh Esa as fatal to the well-being of Bahrein. iMvould, I consider, lead to grave complications, besides furnishing a base for actual aggression. The Albin-Ali who have gone there are said to number some 1 S 00 ) including women and children; and should success be permitted to attend their movement, it is to be feared that the Naeem, Chaban and Dawasir tribes mi^ht be seduced from their allegiance to Bahrein and be led to abandon it and join the seceders to its entire ruin. 8. On the foregoing considerations I am led to the conclusion that the threatened situation calls for absolute prohibition to be carried into effect by force if necessary. I therefore ventured to recommend in my telegram of the 2nd that I should be authorised to enforce the demand upon the Albin-Ali to evacuate Zobarah, by seizing their boats if necessary. A distinct threat in this sense would, I hope, suffice—to be followed by action only if required by the circumstances. No. 75, dated Bushire, the 22nd April 1895. p rom colonel F. A.

After compliments. —It has been reported to me that Sultan Sheikh-bin- Mohamed Salamah in defiance of the wishes of his Chief, Sheikh-Esa-bin- Ali intends to form a settlement at Zobarah, and that in this matter he has your support and assistance. You are well aware that such a settlement at Zobarah is in direct opposition to the will of the Government. I have now received the orders of Government in this matter, and I accordingly have to convey to you a strong and very distinct warning that such a settlement will not be permitted. You will therefore clearly understand that, in order to retain the favour and friendship of Government, you must at once abandon any such project which will not be tolerated.4 I confidently expect an early and satisfactory reply from you, as this matter will not admit of uncertainty or delay.

After compliments. —It has been reported to me that you propose, in defiance of the wish of your Chief, Sheikh Esa-bin-Ali, to form a settlement at Zobarah, and that you have the support and assistance of Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani herein. It has been necessary accordingly to address a very strong warning on the part of Government to Sheikh Jasim, that this will not be permitted. You will also understand for yourself that any such action of yours will not be tolerated. Mr. Gaskin, an Assistant in this Residency, has been desired to explain all this clearly ta you ; and should you happily be wisely disposed in this matter, Mr. Gaskin will afford you his good offices to regain the favour of Sheikh Esa and to receive indulgence from him. I have every hope that in this way all difficulties may be arranged. But should you unfortunately not listen to this friendly advice, you will be liable to the grave displeasure of Government, and to very serious consequences, as on no account will such a settlement be permitted. -1 20rh Shawal i3ij Dated the 25th April r89S . f rorn _sultan-bin-mohamed-bin-salamah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After compliments, —Your esteemed letter has been received and its purport understood. You have informed and ordered me that Zobarah should not be inhabited. Learn, oh friend ! that the origin of our departure from Bahrein arose out of a desire to stop a further development of the occurrences of which you are aware. Such being the case, what are w r e to do when you order that we should not reside in Zobarah, and w r e cannot go against your orders ? We have been under your orders and in obedience to you from olden times, and we have committed no action which is opposed to your wishes. Now our condition is weak as is known to you. The present is the season of our liveli hood, and half the number of our boats have been sent to Bahrein for being equipped for the work, and we cannot therefore obtain the means of moving from this place at once. We hope, therefore, that you will allow us time until the end of the pearl season, and then we shall not linger here. You can rest quite assured in all respects, so far as we are concerned. It is not possible for us to go against you. Our hope is in you and in the kindness of the great Government, that time will be allowed us; but if not, yours is the order. If we could know that a sincere understanding can be effected between us and Sheikh Esa, we would obey him and you. As long as we live no offence shall be committed either by myself or my followers. ta i 1 i-i 3 0t h Shawal 131J Dated, the . 6tt Al . r „ mi „ From — S heikh J asim-bin- T hani, To —colonel F. A. wilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After compliments. —Your esteemed letter has been received and I have understood its purport. I wrote to you a letter before.5 After I had perused your letter which was wrongly addressed to me, I received your letter dated the Sb^rr^irand perused it. I found in it observations which are contrary to the friendship and good will which I cherish towards you— to the defence of the security which I maintain against evil of all sorts—to the settlement of those people at Zobarah and the conciliation which has been effected by me between them and Sheikh Esa, and to the guarantee which I have given that no misfortune shall befall them, nor shall they commit any aggression themselves. All this which I have done has been with the object of maintaining unbroken the bonds of cordial friendship which has existed of old between you and me. And as long as I possess that friendship from you I shall not look for it to others. But if 1 do not get from you the assistance and co-operation, it is needless for me to involve myself in the task of guaranteeing in any degree whatever the preservation of security on land and sea. And I shall leave Katr to its owners and save myself from troubles. I shall go to Zobarah on Monday to meet you and discuss matters personally, if an interview be possible. # Telegram No. 968-E., dated Simla, the 15th May 1895, From—The Viceroy, Simla, To—The Secretary of State, London.

In continuation of correspondence ending with my telegram of the 8th in stant, I have the honour to report in fuller detail for the inlormation of the Gov ernment of India— 2. In a letter by the last mail the Residency Agent at Bahrein reports, under date the 7th instant, that he had learned from people arriving from Zoba- rah that the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa on reaching Zobarah summoned Sheikh Jasim, who, sending on some masons and soldiers in advance, himself arrived on the 5th, and that they together set up a flag-staff for the Turkish flag. The report does not specifically state whether the flag had up to the date of the informa tion been actually hoisted. It was further stated that musjids and houses were building. It is added by the Residency Agent that some regarded the arrival of the Mutasarrif as being with the express purpose of visiting Zobarah, the origin ally expressed intention of going on to Busrah being only for the purpose of concealing the real object. 3. It would appear that some years ago, when the question of the Turkish occupation of Zobarah was dealt with, doubts prevailed at the India Office as to the validity of the Bahrein claim to Zobarah, as against Turkish pretension— vide correspondence forwarded under your endorsement No. 2362 -E of the 4th Novem ber 1890. For this 1 am quite unable to account, as I am unaware of the grounds on which such pretensions on the part of Turkey were based. And the narrative at pages 362 et seq. of the Selections from the Records of the Bombay Govern ment, No. XXIV of 1856, would seem to show that the present holders of Bah rein originally settled at Zobarah in 1 766, and thence effected the conquest of Bahrein some 15 years later. No. 46, dated Bushire, the 18th May 1895. From —colonel F. A. W ilson, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 44, of the 1 ith instant, I have the honour to communicate, for the information of Government, the purport of further re ports received from the Residency Agent at Bahrein by the mail yesterday. 2. The Mutasarrif of El-Hasa after a stay of more than a week at Zobarah, and having given, it is said, assurances of support and full protection to Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani and Sultan-bin-Salamah, and having promised to send a Mudir or Governor with some soldiers to Zqbarah, himself left for Ojair and El-Hasa. The Mudir and soldiers sent from the former place are reported as having arriv ed at Zobarah about the 13th instant, and building operations as being in progress. The Mutasarrif again took the main island of Bahrein en route to Kaiif, halting for a night at Agarria and leaving for Katif on the 15th instant. Sheikh Jasim had helped Sheikh Sultan to equip his boats, which were starting for the pearling about the 12th instant. 3. Nasir-bin-Mubarik, a relative of Sheikh Esa of Bahrein, is also expected on the scene, being reported as encamped with a Beni-Hajir following between El-Hasa and Ojalr. This man's restlessness and intrigues have constantly been a source of apprehension to Sheikh Esa. The last menace to the safety of Bahrein from this quarter was in October 1894 as noted in the Political diary of this office for the week ending 3rd November 1894, Part VI, item 7, and a previous one was reported in my predecessor's letter No. 110, dated 18th August 1892.7 No. 52, dated Bushire, the 24th May 1895. From— C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of previous correspondence, I have the honour to forward, for the information of Government, translation of a letter of the 21st instant, from the Chief of Bahrein, giving the recent movements of the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa in connection with the intrigues to establish a settlement at Zoharah. 2. From the reports of the Residency Agent at Bahrein it appears that by direction of the Mutasarrif a memorial had been prepared by Sheikh Sultan-bin- Salamah and signed by his principal tribesmen, appealing for Turkish support and protection, and that a caravanserai and. houses for Sheikhs Jasim, Sultan and others are being built. The Mutasarrif left Bahrein by the mail steamer bringing these reports, taking with him Mohamed Abdul Wahab on the part of Sheikh Jasim and the petition referred to for presentation to superior authority. 3. There can no longer be any doubt that the intrigue, having for its object the establishment of a position which the Bahrein Chief regards—and as I con sider, with justice—a grave menace to his security and an unjust encroachment on his ancestral territories, is actively fostered by the local Turkish authority. It is evident'also that Sheikh Saltan's profession of submission as previous ly reported, and his plea for merely a delay in the enforcement of his departure from Zobarah, were insincere. Dated the 25th Dilkada 1312-(21st May 1895). From— S heikh E sa-bin- A li , Chief of Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I beg to state that I reported to you in detail the case of the people of Zobarah, and have kept your Agent in Bahrein fully informed regarding the progress of events with a view to your being in possession of the news. As regards the Mutasarrif and his doings and plans I have been somewhat apprehensive, as he is the reverse of his predecessors. When he arrived at Bahrein the first time, he went to Zobarah and gave assurances of safety to the people of the place. He then went to Ojair and summoned Nasir-bin-Mu- barak and his Beni-IIajir followers, and had a consultation with them. He again returned to Bahrein (Agarria) and after two days' stay went to Katif. He has again come to Bahrein, but 1 have not learnt what his object is. I have no mind to talk to him, and I observe an attitude of indillerence towards him in order to secure your approval. I hope that you will bear this case (the movements of the Mutasarrif) in mind, and also the previous case (about Zobarah). My trust is in God and then in the greatness of your power.

And I am constantly expecting the arrival of the Resident and am extremely anxious for it, according to the hope I entertain. By the lapse of time (since your depar ture) joy has returned to them (the people of Zobarah), and their desire has in creased towards building operations, towards contracting friendship with the Bedouins for the purpose of inducing them to settle at Zobarah, and towards misleading the inhabitants of Bahrein to join them. I have kept Khalil in formed of every fresh incident which has occurred in their affairs for com munication to you. I have ascertained that those people are loudly indulging in utterances which are distasteful to me and to you alike. The Mudir, whom the Muta sarrif has placed over them, constantly declaims in an absurd manner agamst the British Government in order to create an impression of its weakness, and I forbear transmitting to you what he says of the British Government. I have therefore been much vexed and have written this letter. 8 G. C. PresJ, Simla.—No. 387 F. D,-—5-9-9S&gt;—74-1 Dated Buslure, the '21th June 1895.

From—The Under-Secretary of State, India Office, To—The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office. With reference to the correspondence ending with Sir T. Sanderson's letter ol the 24th March 1894, I am desired by ridep*?* ice, Voiame x, Aitcbi- Fowler to inform you that the Political Resi- •ou 8 i reaties. -i-.. , „ dent in the Persian Gulf reported on the 17th April that the Albin-Ali tribe, a branch of the Uttobees, who made them selves masters of Bahrein in 1783, have deserted and are forming a settlement at Zobarah with the support of Shaikh Jasim of liidaa. 2. The Government of India authorised the Resident to warn Shaikh Jasim that the settlement would not be allowed, and the Resident reports that a Turkish official, the Mutasarrif of Hasa has gone to Zobarah and the settle ment is being pushed on, Shaikh Jasim acting in concert with the Mutasarrif, who is preparing to hoist the Turkish flag. 3. The Resident wishes to enforce the warning by seizing the Albin Ali's boats. The Government of India say that this might raise the question of the Turkish jurisdiction in El-Katr. The settlement at Zobarah is, however, a menace to Bahrein ; and if Her Majesty's Government permit, the Viceroy would authorise the Resident to act as he has proposed. 4. In accordance with the policy pursued in 1891, Mr. Fowler proposes, with the concurrence of the Earl of Kimberley, to ^ Letter to F or eig n Offie®, 8tb Artist sanction the seizure of the boats of the Albin-Ali if that tribe persists in effecting a settlement at Zobarah. 5. I am to add that a further telegram dated 21st May, of which a copy is enclosed, has been received from the Viceroy stating that it is reported that the Mudir (of El-Bidaa ?) with some Turkish troops sent by the Mutasarrif arrived at Zobarah during the past week. 6. This military movement constitutes a serious menace to Bahrein; and as the Porte has been repeatedly informed that Bahrein is under British pro tection, Mr. Fowler is of opinion that the Porte should be warned that mea sures will be taken to protect the Chief of Bahrein from Turkish aggression.

Bramble (who had arrived the day previous from Bahrein) as Senior Oliicer, Persian Gulf Division. 2. With reference to the recent difficulty that had arisen at Bahrein, ne cessitating the services of the Bramble there, it appearst hat Shaikh Sultan- bin-Mahome 1 Salamah, a subject of Bahrein, had, in defiance of the will of his Chief, departed to Zobarah with his tribe, the Albin-Ali, and intended forming a settlement there with the support of Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani. 3. Such a settlement being in direct opposition to the declared policy of Government, Mr. Gaskin, Vice-Consul, was deputed to convey to Sheikh Sultan- bin-Mohamed Salamah a strong warning that such a proceeding would not be permitted; and in order that his mission might be the more increased in force and authority by the presence of a man-of-war there, the services of U.M.S. Bramble were requisitioned for this purpose. 4. A report of the movements of the Bramble and the result of this mission is 'iven in Lieutenant and Commander Currey's letter to Colonel P. A. Wilson, on his return to Bushire, a copy of which is forwarded herewith for your information. 5.

Dated Busbire, the 26th April 1895. Lieutenant E. H. Currey , Commander, H. M. S. Bramble, Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulp. I have the honour to inform you, in accordance with your memorandum to mc (No. 185, dated 21st April 18 ( J5), that having embarked Mr. Gaskin, Assist ant Political' Resident at Bushire, and also Mahomed Rahim, Residency Agent at Bahrein, I left Bushire on Monday, April 22nd, arriving at Bahrein the fol io win 0, dav. Upon my arrival I landed, accompanied by Mr. Gaskin and Mahomed kahim and paid a visit to the Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali. The Shaikh Esa- bin-Ali stated his case and ended by assuring us that he was prepared to swear bv the Koran that should Shaikh Suit m-bin-Mahomed Salamah return to Bahrein he was prepared to receive him as if nothing had happened, and to allow him and his tribe to reside in Bahrein as before. Havin 0, received this assurance, I left the following day, Wednesday, April 24th, and proceeded to Zobarah, where I arrived in the evening. On account of the shallowness of the water of this place, I was obliged to anchor a Ion'- way from the shore, some 4 miles out, and in consequence Mr. Gaskin, Mahomed Rahim, and 1 did not reach the shore till after 5 o'clock, and Mr Gaskin did not have time to finish his conversation with Shaikh Sultan- 34 bin-Mahomed Sulamali, as we were obliged to return to the ship before complete darkness set in, owing to the great distance she was from the shore. However before leaving, Shaikh Sultan-hin-Mahomed Salamah stated that lie would come hack to Bahrein with us if we took him by force, but that he ■would not come of his own free 'will. Mr Gaskin and I agreed that the best thing to do under the circurn- stances was to leave Mahomed Rahim on shore for the night to see it he could persuade Sultan-bin -Mahomed Salamah to do what was required ot him, and said that we should return in the morning for his answer. 'We accordingly left the ship at 5 a.m . upon Thursday, April 25th, and upon our way on shore encountered Mahomed Rahim coming olf m a native boat, lie informed us that Shaikh Sultan -bin-Mahomed Salamah had left dur ing the night to confer with Shaikh Jasim-bin -Thani, and that the latter was auav 4 days' journey into the interior. He had stated before leaving that e was prepared to leave Zobarah if H. M.'s Government insisted, but that he would not return to Bahrein and place himself under the Government of Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali of that place. I left Zobarah at 7 a.m . and arrived back at Bahrein at 2-30 p.m , when Mr. Gaskin, accompanied by Mahomed Rahim, left the ship to interview r Shaikh E*a-bin-Ali. Shaikh Esa -bin-Ali explained to Mr. Gaskin that, with a view to a\oid future conflicts, he would rather that Sultan-bin -Mahomed Salamah did not return to Bahrein.

In my letter to Shaikh Sultan I was careful to leave the door open to him for submission to the orders of Govern- ment and to his duty to his Chief. Owing, however, to the influence of the Turkish Mudir probably, it was very ill received by the Shaikh, who, when it was at last and after an abortive attempt on the part of two iurkish soldiers to bar the wav, presented to him by my Extra Assistant Mr. Gaskin, took an ohiectionable* and even offensive tone. W r ith my letter was delivered a se cond letter from Commander Pelly, a previous one having received no reply, and Captain Pelly in consequence of the insolent refusal to send any reply, which had been made to Mr. Gaskin, proceeded on the following morning, the 8th, to seize the boats of the tribe, seven being captured and conveyed to Bahrein for safe custody by the Chief. 3. Before leaving for Bahrein, Commander Pelly received a letter from the Mudir i^eneially addressed to the officers of the British Government and to the Assistant Political Officer, claiming Zobarah as part of Turkish territory, and Shaikh Sultan and his tribe as having come under Turkish protection, pro testing against the proceedings taken, and requesting the departure of the ship.Copies of Commander Pelly's letter of proceedings of the 9th and of his two letters of the 7th to Shaikh Saltan, and of Mr. Gaskin's report of the 8th, and also translation of the Mudir's communication, forwarded therewith, are enclosed. 4. My view has hitherto been that Turkish connection with the situation at Zobara'h should be ingored as far as possible, and communication with Tur kish officials avoided. I have now intimated to Commander Pelly in a letter despatched by the Lawrence on the 11th, of which I enclose a copy, that, in my opinion, the claim advanced by the Mudir of the extension of Turkish protection to the Albin-Ali tribe, in their present position, cannot be admitted, and that his operations should proceed.

After compliments. —My former letter informed you clearly that, accord ing to the orders of Government, your establishment at Zabarah in defiance of yo^ir Chief could not be permitted. You replied expressing your continued submission to the will of Government, but asked for delay in obeying the com munication then made to you, till the conclusion of the pearl season. It was quite impossible to admit this request and to allow you to act in defiance of the will of your Chief and the well-known wishes of the Government for several months' and the purport of your le\ter was accordingly reported to Govern ment. Though you must have known that the delay could not be permitted, you had taken no steps to do what was required of you up to 15 days ago. Now I have to convey to you the final and strict orders of Government to return at once with your tribe'to Bahrein and your allegiance to your Chief. Know that if you fail now to obey, active measures to compel you to do so will no longer*be delayed. Be assured that these measures will be taken if you hesitate any longer to do what is required of you, and a further communi cation from me will not be necessary, as needful authority has been given to the man-of-war which will take this order to you to proceed to act as may be necessary. In my former letter I assured you of my good offices towards your recon- ciliation with your Chief, and Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali also expressed his favorable disposition towards you. Your conduct in continued resistance has not deserv ed this favor, but even now if you immediately submit yourself and return to Bahrein, my recommendation in your favor will be made to Shaikh Esa. I have hopes, that you will not listen longer to the words of the evil-dis posed persons who have misled you, and may thus escape the consequences of your rebellious conduct. No. 2-S. Z., dated Bushire, the 5th July 1895. Prom Colonel F. A. Wilson ', Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To-— C ommander J. H. F elly , R.N., H. M. S. Sphinx. You are aware of the general position with reference to the settlement which, in defiance of the Chief of Bahrein, and in direct opposition to the policy' of Government, has been set up at Zobarah by Shaikh Sultan-bin- Mohamed Salamah, with the support, it is understood, of Shaikh Jasim-bin- Thani, and apparently the encouragement of the neighbouring Turkish author- iljv. Shaikh Sultan received a very distinct warning more than two months ao-o that such a settlement would not be permitted. He replied requesting that the demand for his evacuation of Zobarah might be postponed till the close of the pearl season, at the same time professing submission. This request was inadmissible, and I have now received the instructions of Government to the effect that strict orders are to be conveyed to Shaikh Sultan to return immediately with his tribe to Bahrein and to his allegiance to his Chief, failing which active measures will be no longer delayed. 56 I have accordingly the honour to enclose a letter under flying seal, address ed to Shaikh Sultan, conveying the orders of Government, and to request the favour of your proceeding with the vessel under your command to Zobarah and causing the letter to he delivered to Shaikh Sultan in such manner as you may judge most expedient. You will see that Shaikh Sultan is clearly earned that in the event of his hesitation to comply with the requisition now made upon him, measures to enforce it will no longer be delayed. I have therefore to request that should Shaikh Sultan's reception of the orders and warning now addressed to him not be fully satisfactory, you will, after giving him such time as in your judgment may, in the circumstances, be reasonable, proceed to seize such boats belonging to him and to his tribe the Albin-Ali, as you may be in a position to capture, in order to enforce submission to the orders of Govern ment. I would also request the favour of your receiving on board your ship Mr. Gaskin, an Assistant of this Residency, who will be able to assist you with much important local information and in your communications with Shaikh Sultan and any others with whom you have to deal. Mr. Gaskin will also, I hope, prove most valuable in forwarding a reconciliation between the Bahrein Chief and Shaikh Sultan, should the latter happily be so well advised as to seek it, as he has been urged to do. I append a memorandum on minor points which I would ask you to be good enough to make available to Mr. Gaskin also, for his guidance on such points as may more especially concern his action. No more recent information has been obtained than that acquired by your visit to the place some fifteen days ago ; it is possible therefore that the posi tion may have materially changed. Should such prove to be the case, and the change be such as to give hopes that the object of Government to prevent the settlement at Zobarah is in train to be secured, I would request you to use your discretion in dealing with Shaikh Sultan under the instructions of Government above indicated and to favor me w T ith earliest information of the facts. Memo, dated Busliire, the 5th July 1895. From— C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It would he very satisfactory that Shaikh Sultan should be summoned on board to receive the letter conveying the orders and warning which Govern ment has directed should be given to him and the communication which Captain Pelly may have to make to him. Very possibly, however, the Shaikh may, owing to pressure from Shaikh Jasim, or even local Turkish authority, be in a position to render his compliance with such a summons difficult. In such case it would be inadvisable to summon him on board. The Porte has received a warning from Her Majesty's Government in connec tion with its interference at Zobarah, and this warning should by this time have effect on the action of its representatives near that place; it is desirable however that Turkish connection with the situation should, as far as possible, be ignored. Should the seizure of boats become necessary, the course that seems most convenient would be to make them over to the Chief of Bahrein, pending the further orders of Government. The Bahrein Chief w r ill doubtless be able to afford means for identifying the boats belonging to the Albin-Ali tribe, against which it may be necessary to act. He may also be expected to give all the assistance in his power to convey to Bahrein any of the tribe who may be willing to return, should their own boat-transport be insufficient. The Chief has already expressed his readiness to show all possible indul gence to Shaikh Sultan and his followers, and should a disposition to submit be evinced, Mr. Gaskin should impress upon the Chief the necessity for facili tating, by any means of conciliation that may be fitting and reasonable, an amicable solution of the existing difficulty.7 The detention of the whole crews of any boats that may be seized would seem quite unnecessary ; one or two men should however be encouraged to re main in each boat, in order to secure the safety of any property left in them. Should any communication with Shaikh Jasim become necessary, he may be informed, in reply to any reference that he may make to his letter to Kesident, that it was regarded as highly unsatisfactory and as not requiring reply, he being fully aware of the fixed determination of Government in regard to Zobarah. Dated H.M.S. Sphinx at Bahrein, the 9th July 1895. From— Captain J. H. Pklly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, 'i 0 — C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In accordance with your memorandum dated 5th July 1895, I have the honour to report that, having embarked Mr, Gaskin (Assistant Resident), I left liushire on the 5th instant and proceeded to Bahrein, arriving there on the following day. On my arrival Mr. Gaskin proceeded ashore to interview Shaikh Esa-bin- Ali, and returned in the evening accompanied by the Shaikh's brother, the Shaikh s A izier and two liesidency Agents, with whom I then proceeded to Zobarah, arriving at that place about noon on the 7th instant. I immediately sent my Interpreter ashore with a letter, requesting Shaikh Sultan to come on board to receive your letter addressed to him. To this he returned no answer, but sent a reply to the Residency Agent, who had sent him a private note, to the eflect that he was ill and could not do what was required of him. A copy of this correspondence is attached for your information. My Interpreter states that on landing he was not allowed by Turkish soldiers to see Shaikh Sultan, but was taken to the Turkish Mudir, were he met Shaikh Sultan's son, to whom he handed my letter to be taken to his father, who was said to be suilering Irom dysentery and unable in consequence to see anyone. Taking into consideration that Shaikh Sultan had through the intrigue of the Turkish Mudir (who appears to have followed the son and may have inter cepted my letter) treated my letter in an insulting manner, I considered it necessary to take further steps in this matter; and to ensure his receiving your letter, together with my ultimatum as to the action to be taken in default of any reply, I requested Mr. Gaskin to land and personally deliver them to Shaikh Sultan-bin-Mahomed Salamah. Mr. Gaskin thereupon landed, accompanied by the Residency Agent and the Shaikh's Vizier (Mr. Gaskin's report I enclose). Before daylight on the morning of the 8th the steam and pulling cutters, manned and armed, with Lieutenant Kirke in charge (Mr. Purdy, Gunner, being in charge of the strain cutter) proceeded to seize the boats of the Albin Ali^ which resulted in seven of them being taken. One of these is a Bahrein boat which appears to have been detained at Zobarah by Shaikh Sultan against the wishes of the men. No opposition was made by any of the boats upon being seized, the crews of some of them sailing their boats olf to the ship. Just before leaving Zobarah a Turkish official visited the ship, bringing with him the letter which I enclose, and to which I made no reply. I left Zobarah at 11 a. m ., on the 8th instant with the captured boats in tow and arrived at Bahrein in the evening. These boats are being turned over to the Chief of Bahrein for safe custody. With reference to the letter received from the Turkish Mudir, I shall re main here pending a further communication from you. I have found Mr. Gaskin a great assistance during these proceedings.

From—The M udir of O jair , Agent to Mudir of Zobarah, To—Those Officers o£ the British Government and also the Assistant who may see this. Should you enquire especially concerning those persons composing the Albin-Ali (namely) Sultan -bin-Mohamed Salamah and his tollowing, small or great, their residence is iu the locality of Zobarab, which is (part) of the territories of the Turkish Government under the jurisdiction of Katr ana the nronerty of the Sultan, who is our Sultan, and the foresaid tribe have como under the protection of the (Ottoman) Government. It (».«■. the foregoing statement) should be known, and they Albiu-Ali) should experience no injustice at your hands. I am Seyed Mohamed Raouf, Mudir of Ojair and Agent of the Mudir of Zobarah. Above me (there is) a Kaim Makam, above whom there exists a Mutasarrif (named) Ibrahim Foozi Pasha. It is necessary for me to furnish information; if, therefore, you entertain any action, inform me that I may place the information before the Kami Makam and the Mutasarrif. This (your action) is not in accordance with the customs of Go\ernments which have formed laws and policies, and you have acted in opposition to (international) laws and policies.I am sending you Corporal Ilaji Abdullah, and my desire is that you should inform mo of your reasons and intentions. If you are desirous of obtainin'; replies, it is not necessary to come in a man-of-war and enter (the waters of) Zobarah. Zobarah is a part of Katr and is the property of the Turkish Government and our Sultan Abdul Hamad Khan. If you desire to seize Sultan-bin-Mohamed and take him on board, you have no right to do so, and regarding your contention in that the Albin-Ali are subjects^to Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali, I have true information that they are of the inhabitants of Katr from ancient days, from grandfather to son. Your vessel should not remain in the harbour of Zobarah and, may it please God, that on the receipt of my letter to you, you will depart. I shall refer to my Government and you should refer to yours. You have taken those vessels which were in the harbour, in some^ of which there are (some) pearls, shells, etc. I do not understand }oui desiies actions), and this is contrary to (all) laws and usages ; and if you have any reason for the same, negotiate with me and receive my reply and prevent your commit ting these injustices. If any of them (i.*?., boats) disappear and anj thing lost therefrom, you are answerable. At present Sultan is sick and is unable to send you a reply; let this be your reply. You have no right to act contrary to custom, and on your receiving this letter you should inform me what are your intentions. Dated Zobarah, the Sth July 1895. p rom j, C. ( iaskin . Esq, Extra Assistant to the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf, To Captain j. H. Pelly, R.N., H. M. S. Sphinx. I have the honour to report that in compliance with your request I pro ceeded to Zobarah, taking with me the Residency Agent of Bahrein and Abdul Rahman -bin-Abdul Wahab, Vizier to the Chief of Bahrein, and beg to give, in detail, all that took place on that occasion. On our arrival at the town of Zobarah I ordered your Interpreter to go and ascertain the locality of Shaikh Sultan-bin -Mahomed-bin-Salamah's residence, and to inform Shaikh Sultan to the effect that I was the bearer of a letter from you, which I desired to deliver to him personally. When the Interpreter landed he was met by two Turkish soldiers, one of whom is a Corporal in that service. They prevented the Interpreter to hold any communication with the natives, and told him that Saaikh feultan was m a state unfit to receive any one, and Shaikh Sultan s son, together with Khalifah bin-Mubarak, one of the headmen of the Albin-Ali, were with the i urkish- Mudir; he therefore must go to the ]\Iudir s quarters if lie desired to meet them. Anticipating that some unnecessary delay may be caused by the intrigue of the Mudir, we landed and went direct to the hut in which Shaikh Sultan receives visitors. On the way tliere we were met by the two soldiers, who informed us that the Mudir desired us to go to lum as we had no business to interview any one prior to visiting him and informing him of the cause of our presence in Zobarah I requested the Corporal to convey my compliments to the Mudir and inform him that as his presence in Zobarah is not recognised, there was no necessity of my calling upon him I also ordered the Interpreter to go to the Mudir's quarters and inform Shaikh Sultan's son that I desired him to come to me. The Interpreter, finding only Khalifah-bin-Mubarak with the Mudir, con veyed my message to him, with which message Khahfah-bin-Mubarak com plied. „I informed Khalifah-bin-Muharak that there was an urgent necessity for mv seeing Shaikh Sultan -hin-Mahomed-bin-Salamah with as little delay as possible, and if he was too ill to leave his bed, I would be glad to go to him. After a delay of nearly half an hour, I requested the Residency Agent to proceed to Shaikh Sultan's residence, which was only a few yards off, with the same message, and after his having gone a few paces in that direction he was promptly stopped by the two soldiers and ordered not to proceed another step. I got up to go to Shaikh Sultan's house, and on nearing the soldiers was in a, like manner stopped, and on insisting to proceed, they seized me by the arms and informed me that the Mutasanif had givea orders to the effect that no one should see Shaikh Sultan. I therefore must not attempt to act contrary to the orders of the Turkish Government. I told them that I could not recognise those orders and must obey mine at any cost; they therefore had better make way. They however would not listen and attempted to force me back, where upon I drew out my whistle for the purpose of; calling for assistance. The soldiers quickly interpreted my action and released me before I could whistle, and the Corporal went to give information to the Mudir, whilst the other stood aside. It appeared to me that the Mudir would recognise my determination to falGl my orders at any cost, and it was likely that he would place no further obstacles. 1 therefore thought it fit to wait a little before making another attempt which might lead to some undesirable results. On the Mudir receiving the Corporal's story, he came out and asked the second soldier why he had been making such a row and forthwith despatched the Corporal to Shaikh Sultan's house. Shortly after this occurrence Shaikh Sultan and Khalifah-bin-Mubarak appeared, and I told the former that as I wished to see him privately, I desired the absence of the Mudir; and in compliance with the same he requested the Mudir to retire. After the retirement of the Mudir T personally delivered your letter to gether with that from Colonel Wilson to Shaikh Sultan, informing him that I sincerely hoped he would show his good sense by giving agreeable replies to both letters. Shaikh Sultan-bin -Mahomed-bin-Salamah read the two letters in my pre sence, and their contents caused him to behave in a manner contrary to his usual habits, and he talked big, stating that he was no slave or subject to Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali, and though he could not contend against the power of the British Government, no force or action on their part would compel him to return to Bahrein; that both he and Shaikh Jasim-bin-Mahomed-bin-Thani had a few days previously written to Shaikh Esa-bin-Ali on this subject, and private negotiations were more likely to lead to their conciliation than threats from the British Government, with whom he has nothing to do. The Mudir here returned and Shaikh Sultan became more offensive, threatening both the Residency Agent and the Vizier, adding that they were the cause of his misfortune and trouble with the British Government. He then turned round on me and told me that if the man-of-war was to wait for a month, he would not send replies to the two letters : I therefore had better not wait any longer. Seeing further negotiations of no avail, and Shaikh Sultan being disposed to set the orders of the British Government at defiance, and disregard your letter, I thought it fit not to prolong my visit beyond this and returned to H. M. S. Sphinx, I may add that when Sheikh Sultan made an appearance, he was not in the condition as reported by the Turkish soldiers to the Interpreter.

I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 9th and to state that your proceedings in carrying out the objects of Government appear to have been very satisfactory. 10With reference to the letter from the Turkish Mudir at Zobarah, protesting against your proceedings and intimating that the Albin-Ali tribe has come under the protection of the Turkish Government, I am of opinion that, under the tenour of the instructions of Government, this claim is inadmissible and should not be admitted by you. I have accordingly to request that, failing compliance with the orders which have been conveyed to Shaikh Sultan, you will proceed to seize the boats of the tribe which in your former letter were supposed to be in a situation rendering the operation feasible, to such extent as you may judge to be expedient. I am requesting the Commnnder of R. I. M. S. Lawrence to give you such assistance with boats, and in the conveyance ol craft, that you may seize, as you may require.

Jasim is said to be collecting boats and followers. I am instructing the Resident to inform the Mudir that Turkish claims to Bahrein are totally inadmissible, and any one makin- an attempt against Bahrein must take the consequences. I recommend a strong remonstrance to the Porte against the proceedings of ^ their local officials on the Katr coast, over which we admit no iurkish jurisdiction.

I can hardly believe it possible that such an attack as Commander Pelly conceives might be brought about by Shaikh Jasim on Bahrein should be at tempted. Having regard to the intimate part which has been openly taken by the local Turkish authorities in the affairs of Albin-Ali, such an attack would seem to involve full Turkish, responsibility for an overt act of hostility which can scarcely be apprehended. 3. The capture of nine more of the zVlbin-Ali boats reported to have been effected on 15th July seemed to offer a prospect of some result. Salim-bin- Hamad, who was in one of these boats, was after arrival at Bahrein reconciled with the Chief, and appeared to welcome the opportunity of a return to his for mer position. Boats provided by the Bahrein Chief were accordingly^ sent to Zobarah to bring over the family and followers of Salim, who holds a high place in the Albin-Alf tribe, and such others as might be willing to return. One of these boats returned at once, reporting that the rest, nine in number, had been de tained by the newly -appointed Turkish Mudir. This action by, or directly m the presence and with the countenance of, the local Turkish authority, makes the situation more serious, and I would request that I may be favoured with the instructions ol Government upon it. 4. Besides Shaikh Jasim's letter of the 10th July to me, which has not been answered, he has written several to the Bahrein Chief. They are full of13 conventional verbiage and are in my opinion not worthy of any confidence. His statement in the letter to me that Mr. Gaskin had drawn a pistol upon Shaikh Sultan on the 7th July is a deliberate falsehood. In a subsequent letter to the Chief he took a different tone, excusing Shaikh Sultan for not bavin^ • • • ^ received the visit ma proper manner, and saying that he had censured him for it, though 'no blame can be attached to a man whose mind has been affected by illness/' Altogether in Shaikh Jasim's letter there is a somewhat unintelli gible mixture of protest, profession, and appeal. After writing the above I have received your telefrrnm of this dny, in timating that Lawrence should be sent to obtain further information.

After compliments. —When I learnt the news of the arrival of the man-of- war, and knowing that Sultan (bin-Mohamed Salamah) was ill, 1 started with the object of meeting the Captain, the Assistant and Khalid (bin-Ali). I had scarcely reached Zobarah when I learnt that they had suddenly landed there and frightened the people of the country by (a demonstration of) armed boats, and that the Assistant had landed with a drawn revolver at Sultan (bin-Mohamed Salamah); but they (Sultan and his people would appear to be meant) avoided them by good means. Afterwards they (armed boats) disturbed the (peace of the) sea and seized the boats belonging to the poor and humble striving to earn their livelihood, together with the unopened oyster shells they had on board and all their property. The Albin-Ali tribe did not leave Bahrein, but on account of the humili ation which they experienced : they have not been rebels. I stood guarantee for them to Shaikh Esa (assuring him) that no mischief would arise from the side of Zobarah or from its inhabitants, and they have committed no offence. They are poor who earn their livelihood : they are not slaves. Their original domicile was Katr and they resided in Fareybah and Zobarah, and thence removed to Hawaylah and El-Bidaa. They have not been ruled as slaves. This proceeding (which has been undertaken against them) is contrary to your (sense of) justice, and is a wrong unbecoming of you. They have no knowledge of their own affairs : these are known to God and then to me. Dated Ras Lufan, the 14th July 1S95. From—C aptain J. H. P elly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To— C olonel F. W. W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 10th instant, received per R.I.M.S L&lt;iicrence on the forenoon of the 12th, and to thank you for placing that ship at my disposal for a time. In compliance with your letter I left Bahrein at 8 a.m . on the 13th, K.I.M.S. Lawrence in company, and proceeded to Zobarah, anchoring off that place at 2 p.m . the same day. I found all the boats, about lli in number, hauled up on the beach, and therefore did not think it expedient to attempt their seizure. During my stay at Zobarah I received two letters from Jasim-bin-Mohamed Thani, asking for an interview on behalf of Shaikh Sultan who was sick, to both of which I replied stating that he could come off to the ship if he desired to see me. This, however, he would not do. A copy of this correspondence is attached.14 I am also forwardins vou a letter, under flying seal, received through the Bahrein Resident Agent from the same source, which has been duly translated hv Mr Gaskin, and from the lone of which it would appear that Jasuu-bin- Thaui intends to support the Albin-Ali against whatever proceedings may he taken in their coercion. According to news received from a messenger from Koweis, Jasim advises that the pearling fleet should proceed to the banks off El-Bidda. . f This messenger also stated that Jasim has sent a letter to the Mutasarnf of El-Hasa, reporting ray proceedings. from a letter received from Jasim, Shaikh Esa-hin-AH is of opinion that he may agitate the Beni-Hajar tribes to make an attack on Bahrein Island. ^ While off Zobarab several Bedouin tents and camels were seen, «hi&lt; h were not there on our first visit. These appear to be the levies sent by Jasim- bin-Moharaed Thani to help the Albin-Ah. Hearing nothing further from Jasim-hin-Thani, I left Zobarah at 8 A. M. this morning, Lawrence in company, and proceeded round the Katr Pemn- 1 f-n^fis lias Lufan. We passed two small hatches oi boats, \\hich proved to be 'boats belonging to subjects of Shaikh Esa, and batches which we stopped to inspect, and which also turned out to be Bahrein boats. I could father no information from either of these boats as to tbe place where the boats of tbe Albin-Ali are pearl-diving. l am anchored off Ras Lufan for the night and shall proceed in the morning down the coast in search of the Albin-Ali boats. . My intention is, it possible, to be at Bahrein on Tuesday evening or At ed- nesday morning. Dated Bahrein, the 17th July 1895. j? rom C aptain J. H.

Tru vf i i • On the morning of tbe 20th Mr. Gaskin reported to me that Khalifab-bin- Jasim son of Jasim-bin-Thani, bad arrived at Bahrein, bearing a letter from his father to Sheikh Esa to tbe effect that he (Jasim) would be responsible for the evacuation of Zobarah by Shaikh Sultan within 12 to 15 days, also that the tribe should be allowed to return. Khalifa-bin-Jasim also requested an intei- vicw with Mr. Gaskin, whicb was granted. I requested Mr. Gaskm to inform him for the information of his father, that if a letter from Shaikh Sultan pio- mS'nl his return with his following to Bahrein within 12 days is received within four days, the matter will be considered; but it no answer is ^ rt f lic0r in' within that time, further action will he at once taken against those of Albin-Ali who continue to disobey the orders of Government. I gave permission for Sheikh Esa to send back to Zobarah Salim bin- Hamad and people taken in boats, that they may bring their families to Bahrein. Amicable arrangement has been arrived at between Sheikh Esa and Salimbin-Hamad.On the evening of the 21st Shaikh Esa despatched 5 boats to Zobarah, and another 5 yesterday 0 morning, for the purpose of conveying Salim's family and such of his followers who may decide to return to their homes at Bahrein, and vesterdav evening intelligence was received here respecting the detention of nine of these boats at Zobarah by Mahomed Effendi, the newly-appointed Mudir at that place ; also that the tribesmen have been warned by him against returning to Bahrein. With reference to this T am sending him a letter demanding an explana tion, a copy of which I enclose. It is also stated that Ibrahim Foosi Pasha, the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa, is collecting levies, but for what purpose is yet unknown, and that he has in structed Jasim-biQ-Thani to send reinforcements to Zobarah. 4. letter has been received bv a Banyan from Katif to the effect that it hasbeensuggestedby Mahomed Abdul Wahab to the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa that he should prohibit the landing of British subjects there, as they are suspected of being there for the purpose of spying upon their movements. It is reported that the Turkish gunboat Zuhaf arrived at Katif on the 21st with the newly -appointed Kaim Makam of that place on board ; her future movements are unknown. Seein' all the difficulties in the way, I consider that it would be advisable to telegraph for another man-of-war to be sent up the Gulf for the protection of Bahrein in case of attack. As matters stand at present, I deem it necessary that I should remain handy to Bahrein, and consider that your presence here is highly desirable.

Hearin'- that vou are detaining nine boats belonging to the Shaikh of Bahrein who is on friendly terms with the British Government, and Zobarah beinff one of the towns belonging to him, also tne Albin-Ali being his subjects, I demand that vou will inform me by what authority you are detaining these Bahrein boats which were sent to Zobarah for the purpose of conveying those of the Albin-Ali who desire to return to Bahrein and to their allegiance to their Chief. No Turkish authority is recognised by the British Government at Zobarah. Enclosure in letter No. 37 of the 12th July 1S95, frrm the Secretary, Political and Secret Jjepartment, India Office.

On the receipt of Your Lordship's despatch No. 206 of the 30th ultimo, I lost no time in informing the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the rumoured intention of the Albin-Ali tribe to form a settlement at Zobarah on the Persian Gulf with the support of the Turkish Mutasarrif of Uasa. I caused it to be poined out to His Excellency, who appeared to have no knowledge of the question, that the position of Great Britain with regard to Bahrein was perfectly well known to the Porte, and referred him to the Embassy's note verbale, of which a copy was forwarded to the Foreign Office in Sir C. Ford's No. 3i8 of 15th November 1892. An aide -memoire on the subject was left with His Excellency. Telegram dated Simla, the 9th August 1895.

Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, ( To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to your telegram of 27th July, and in continnation of my telegram of yesterday's date, I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, that I despatched the 11. I. M. S. Lawrence to Bahrein on the 28th July to obtain the further information desired regarding the apprehension of an attack on Bahrein, for which some grounds had been indicated in reports which had reached me. 1 enclose copy of Commander Felly's report of the 30th July, and of its enclosures 2. The information now available does not lead me to modify the opinion expressed in my letter ^fo. io of the 2jth »luly, and X do not le^aid an attac k, on Bahrein as at present probable. The rumoured collection of levies by the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa can hardly be taken, in my opinion, to imply a threat of overt hostility, and the same may be said o Shaikh Jasim s reported pi epila tions as in all the circumstances of the case his act would be tantamount to the direct action of the Turkish authorities. The local representatives of Tur kish authority are, however, described as an irresponsible class of oilicials on whose discretion no reliance can be placed. 3. It will be seen that Syed llaouf Effendi, acting for the Mudir of Zobarah, does not, in his reply, directly meet Commander Telly's demand for an explana tion of the detention of the Bahrein boats on the^ 22nd July, llis letter, however, amounts to an acceptance of responsibility lor the act, and my information is that the boats were boarded by Turkish soldiers, the sails and gear being removed. 4 has alreadv been reported that Salim-bin-ITamad, after lenching Bahrein with the boats captured on the loth July, was readily reconciled with the Bahrein Chief, mutual engagements being executed. Salim is a relative of the late Esa-bin-Tarif, head of the Albin-Ali tribe, who died about a year and a half a'-o. The llesidencv Agent reports that the Chief has now appointed him in succession to the late head of the tribe, and that the appointment will be welcomed by the tribe, who will prefer him to Saikh Sultan. Sahm has begged that his boats mav be allowed to go pearling, so that he and his immediate followers may be spared the loss caused by the stoppage of these operations. I am authorizing the grant of his request, considering this to be a just as well as a politic measure. 5. The Turkish corvette or gunboat Znhqf, reported as having arrived at ICatif with reliefs on the 21st July, is now stated to be at ^obaiah, 1 regret to report the receipt of an intimation of the death on 27th July, from heat appolexy, of Chief Engineer J. N. Midgeby of II. M. S. Sphinx. Dated Bahrein, the 30th July 1895. jr rom —Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In accordance with your letters Tsos. 53 and 397, dated 2/th instant, I have the honour to acquaint you as follows :— The latest intelligence received by the Chief of Bahrein is to the effect that Jasim -bin-Mahomed-Thani has issued orders to all the Albin-Ali pearl ing fleet to return to Zobarah, and he has also ordered the launching of all the available boats that are at Zobarah. He has issued orders to his following' and to Nasir- bin-Mubarak to be present at Zobarah.Threatening letters have also been received by Shaikh Esa and his son from Jcisim showing his animosity towards him. ihese letters are being forwarded to you by the Agent of this place. I also enclose the reply to my letter to the Turkish official at Zobarah, from the tenour of which it appears that the Albin-Ali are receiving every support from the Turks. The Shaikh of the Nairn tribe at Bahrein has received a letter from Jasim, demanding that he should either leave Bahrein with his following for Katr or send boats^to convey all the cattle he has at Katr back to Bahrein. The Turkish gun vessel Zuhaf is now at Zobarah. It has also been reported to me that an atrocious and daring act of piracy and attempted murder of a British Indian subject has taken place about 6 miles below Katif within sight of the shore on the 2f3th instant about 9 a.m. The perpetrator of this outrage is a Bedouin by name Ahmad-bin-Salraan, cousin to Nasir -bin-Mubarak. The victim, a banyan, had his right hand cut com pletely off from the wrist. The doctor's report upon him to me I enclose. I shall most probably leave here to-morrow or Thursday for a cruise round the coast. Translation of letter received from Sayid Mahomed Raonf Effendi [Mudir of Ojair and Agent of the Mudir of Zobarah), to Commander Felly, H. M. S. ' Sphinx,' dated the 26th July 1895. Your letter dated 23rd July 1895 received, and I have understood what you have wTitten. With reference to the nine boats that you sent to convey the families of those of the inhabitants of Zobarab, whom you have captured by force from under the fla^ of the Commander of the Faithful and Sultan of the Unitarians, the said families are the subjects of the High Government from ancient days and for ever, and they only settled at Zobarah by the orders of the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa. Both you and Mr. Gaskin have committed injustices beyond rules and friendship in taking boats belonging to the people of Zobarah, goods being in them to the value of 5 lakhs of dollars, and the owners firstly under the protec tion of God and secondly under the High Ottoman Government. You have also prevented them from following their occupation. So far you have caused loss to all boats belonging to the people of Katr which have reached your side. Also you have seized the boats which you have found belonging to the people of Zobarah, though they have not sinned ; and no one has any claims against them except that they have come under the shadow of the Commander of the Faithful and the protection of the High Ottoman Government. Let it not be hidden from you that Bahrein is under Katr, also Katr and Bahrein are part of the domains of the High (Ottoman) Government. The origi nal persons who took Bahrein from its people w^ere of the inhabitants of Katr. Al-Khalifah were merchants from Koweit and strangers to them. They were onlv four persons and were appointed Agent over Bahrein; also paid tithes and taxes to Katr and to Bin-Saood, the Sultan's officer. Differences arose between them and Bahrein. Then flew the flag of the High Ottoman Government. You falsely represented (matters) to the high Government in support of your claim of protection over them. This not satisfying you, you have exercised false aggression towards the people, of Katr, taking all their boats and goods, also imprisoning '(some of) their people, though they are under the protection of God and that of the Commander of the Faithful, the successor to the prophet of God of the world. • You have committed all these great actions against them. It is evident from what is known that the Commander of the Faithful will directly over throw vour authority iu Bahrein, and support her against you and others. 17Dated Bahrein, the 29th July 1895. From— S urgeon F. B radshaw, To—The Commander, H. M. S. Sphinx. I have the honour to submit to you the following report of the injuries sustained by the Banyan named Tikchand Dewairgados. His right hand was completely severed above the wrist, exposing both bones of the forearm, and he had a large incised wound extending from the lower angle of the scapula across the back of the shoulder, terminating about the junction of middle and upper third of the arm : this wound is about 1 inch deep. There is also a smaller wound on the back about 8 inches long and i inch deep. When I visited him he was very much exhausted from the shock and loss of hemorrhage; and as no attempt had been made to dress the wounds, * there was extensive suppuration from them, especially from the sword cuts in the shoulder. I amputated the forearm a little above the lower third. Consi dering the shock and loss of blood and the extensive suppuration from the sword wounds, I think he is in a very critical condition.

W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to report, for the information of the Government of India, that the intimation and warning conveyed in your confidential telegram of the 4ith instant, have been communicated to the Turkish representative at Zobarah, through the Commander of ELM.S. ' Sphinx.' 2. From Commander Felly's report of the 6th instant, of which I enclose a copy, it will be seen that the Turkish assumption of control of the situation, and intervention in the affairs of the Albin-Ali, have become very pronounced. It would appear that the Turkish flag has been given to the Zobarah boats andIhfit their raovoraents arc controlled. I undersfahd that Commander Pelly has some doubt of the effieaey of further proceedings against the Albin-Ali, owinic to the Turks having taken matters into their own hands. In my opinion, however, the hoisting of the Turkish flag on a boat of that tribe, need in no way be held to demand a recognition that such boat is rightfully under the protection of, that Government, or to bar a seizure. Meantime the nine boats sent from Bahrein for the conveyance to that place from Zobarah, of the family and followers of Shaikh Salim-bin-Hamad, remain in detention at Zobarah. It is desirable, I venture to submit, that these should be forcibly recovered, failing compliance with a demand for their release. Commander Pelly has not, however, stated that he has information whether the boats are in a position to be readily recovered and may not be prepared to undertake the operation with the means at his disposal. 3. I would request special reference to the report that H.M .S. Sphinx will very shortly require coal, and that it will be necessary for her to return to Bushire to obtain it about the 20th instant. Though service at the present moment in these seas, is, and brobably will be, for at least four weeks to come, a very severe trial for a European crew, I would hesitate to recom mend even a temporary withdrawal of all protection, and the means of enfor- cing our authority, from Bahrein at the present juncture. Information has constantly reached me that extreme uneasiness and alarm prevail among the inhabitants, and that people have in consequence left the place. 'While con sidering therefore, as I have already reported, that in all the present circum stances, an attack is not seriously to be apprehended, it would, in my opinion, be imprudent, having regard to the state of local feeling, to leave the place without the support of a visible evidence of our power. I would accordingly submit, for the consideration of Government, that another war vessel should be sent. 4. I have been unable to get any information of a second Turkish gun boat having been sent to Zobarah as mentioned by Commander Pelly. I hardly think it possible that there should be a second vessel, unless such should have come from some place beyond the Gulf. Dated Bahrein, the 6th August 1895. *k:' p rom —Captain J. H. Telly, Commander and Senior Naval Officer, To—The Political Resident, Persian Gulf. I have the honuor to inform you that I left this port on the 31st July and proceeded to Zobarah arriving there the same day. The Turkish gun-vessel Zuhafvi&amp;s there on our arrival, and the Captain informed me that his orders were to await the arrival of the Mutasawif of El-Hasa, whom he expected daily, and in the meantime to keep off any threatened attack on Bahrein, lie also said-that his spies had reported to him that there were 14,000 men armed with Martini -llenry rifles about four hours* walk inland. A Bahrein! who swam off to the ship at Zobarah, stated that Jassim had with him just outside Zobarah about 50 of his following and that the report about the 14,000 men was incorrect. I left Zobarah on the morning of the 2nd instant, and proceeded to the pearl- banks off lias Lufan and upon nearing a batch of boats, several of them made for the shore, and as it was blowing fresh and 1 was unable to overtake them, I fired a blank charge and in response one of them hoisted Turkish colors. There is no doubt from the evidence of the natives on board at the time that these boats belong to Zobardh, and this coincides with the report I heard that all Zobarah boats have been supplied with a Turkish flag. The Znhaf visited boats at Fasht-al Debel on Saturday, and asked whether there were any Bahrein boats there, and upon being informed there were none, they ordered the Zobarah boats not to leave that position for three days, when they w r ould be further communicated with. I have forwarded the reply to the Turkish Mudir of Zobarah, in accordance with your memorandum dated 214tli instant. It is reported that another Turkish gun-boa I lias arrived at Zoharab. I shall shortly be requiring coal, and it will be necessary for me to proceed to Busbire in about 14 days' time for this purpose. Tpleoram No. 1630-E., dated Simla, the 26th Ang-ust 1895.

W ilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, P^oreign Department. In continuation of my telegram of yesterday, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of Commander Pelly's report of the lith instant and enclosure. 2. I have previously expressed the view that notwithstanding the very disturbing rumours that have been rife, a serious attack on Bahrein couldhardly bo believed to be possible, my main reason for this opinion being that such an attack must be held to involve nothing short of the fullest responsibi lity of the Turkish Government. It has, however, been urged by Mr. Gaskin, Extra Assistant Resident, who went to Bahrein with H. M. S. Sphinx last month, and has since remained there, that having regard to attempts by Jasim to tamper with the loyalty of some of Shaikh Esa's people, a destructive outbreak might be brought about. This could be effected, it is urged, by a comparatively small party of Jasim's people, or of the wilder Bedouin element influenced by him, which being joined by some c^' those on the Idand on landing, might work considerable mischief, Jasim meantime counting on escaping responsibility by throwing the blame on Shaikh Esa's own people. 3. Yesterday I had the opportunity of closely questioning Agha Mohamed Rahim, who had just arrived by the mail, having attended Mr. Gaskin on the spot for more than a month past, and who having long served us as Residency Agent at Bahrein,-is familiar with the surrounding people and local feeling. He regards Jasim—ostensibly holding the important olftce of Kaim Makam of Katr under the Ottoman Government—as an utterly unscrupulous, reckless, and irresponsible character with an unlimited faculty for intrigue. He holds the iirmest conviction that Jasim is at heart thoroughly inimical to Turkish authority, and declares the secret aim and object of that restless adventurer to be a rupture betweenGreat Britain and the Porte, whh the result of a severe blow to the prestige of the latter in these parts, Jasim would thereupon throw off his very uncertain allegiance to the Ottoman Government, and openly defying its authority, as he did some three years ago, when lie inflicted a serious reverse on a Turkish force, would make common cause with the Ruler of Nejd, and trust to making his peace with us by plausible excuses and sub mission. An obvious difficulty as regards the above views at once sugirests itself, that the Turkish authorities would hardly lend themselves so readily and com pletely as their recent action implies, to such designs of Jasim. To this Agha Mohamed Rahim replies that the Porte is profoundly ignorant of the actual facts and true situation as regards a remote part of its territory, and is most ill- served by its local officers, who supply the most false and self-interested information. 4. In the above premises there is, in my opinion, much truth, certainly so with regard to the character attributed to Jasim, and the ignorance and weak ness of the Ottoman Government in these parts. But upon the conclusion, attri buting a definite and somewhat complex design to Jasim, it is not possible without further evidence to form an opinion. It does not however seem necessary to fathom the true projects of Jasim in the very active intrigues to which he lias committed himself : it will sufRce to recognise the fact that he is perfectly unscrupulous and reckless of responsibility, and thus some colour is given to the constant rumours and universal fears of an attack on Bahrein which might otherwise be lightly regarded. The balance of probability is still, in my opinion, against such an attempt, but the very general alarm prevailing—our subjects being reported as carrying their valuables for safety to the Agency—is in itself mischievous, and I have accordingly thought it right to urge the desirability of the presence of another man-of-war. 5. In my telegram of yesterday I have also ventured to recommend the adoption of stronger measures, and in this connection I enclose a translation of the Bahrein Chief's letter to me concerning the seizure and detention of his boats sent to Zobarah to bring over the family and followers of Shaikh Salim-bin-Hamad, who had made his peace with Shaikh Esa. This incident was most unfortunate as encouraging resistance and strengthening the influence for mischief of Jasim. I would suggest therefore, as a first step, that should another man-of-war be sent up, these boats should be forcibly recovered after despatch of an ultimatum, subject to the opinion of the Senior Naval Officer on the practicability of the operation. And with regard to doubts which, I understand. Commander Pelly lias as to the warrant for the seizure of Albin-Ali boats, now wearing the Turkish flag, it appears to me that the recent grant of the flag, by possibly irresponsible local 23authorities, should not bar the operations which had previously been under taken. 6. I would request the favour of instructions upon Commnnder Polly's enquiry as to his discretion in firing upon a fleet of boats apparently hostile, though'under Turkish colours, to which I referred in my telegram of yesterday. And In this connection 1 would report that a request of Shaikh Esa for per mission to equip a boat to follow up the perpetrator of the two eases of piracy that have been reported has been refused, to avoid giving any sort of excuse for acts of violence by native craft. It is alleged, however, that Ahmad-bin- Salman who committed the two acts of piracy has Turkish countenance in his proceedings. Dated Bahrein, the l4tli August 1895. p rom Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, 'po Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ' In continuation of my letter dated 8th instant, I have the honour to further inform you as follows : — Intelligence has been received that on Thursday last a pearling boat be longing to Shaikh Esa was captured by the pirate Ahmad-bin-Salman on the west side of Fasht-al-Debel. A copy of my letter sent to the Commander of the Zuhaf reporting this matter I enclose for your information. News has also been received to the elfect that two days after the receipt of a reply to the IVlutasarrif's telegram to Constantinople with reference to Zobarah affairs, he collected a large following of Arabs and Turkish troops at a well named Beer Nejim, situated outside El-Hasa, and has given out that he intends going to Nejd, but I consider this doubtful as the nearest water-supply there is seven days' journey. Several of Jasim's boats are collected off Wakrah and messenger boats are calling in all the Katr boats to the same place. A messenger boat has also been despatched by Jasim to call in the Albin-Ali boats. It seems to be the general opinion here that Jasim is now determined to make the attack, and in anticipation of this Shaikh Esa is calling in his pearling fleet. I request to be informed whether, in the event of my meeting at sea a fleet of boats apparently hostile sailing under Turkish colours, I am authorised in firing on the same without or within the three mile limit of the Katr coasts. I consider that another man-of-war is urgently needed here ; for if an attack is made under the direction of the Turks, I fear that the island will be taken on account of an insufficient garrison, another great weakness being the unsurveyed state of the south side of the island, thus preventing ships fiom having free action in those waters. Do you not under the circumstances consider that it would be advisable to have a small force of troops here for the protection of liahiein and Entish prestige ? In case of my not being able to cral shortly, I should propose that the Lawrence should be sent over to supply me. The boat that conveyed my letter to Zobarah has not yet returned. I am therefore proceeding to Zobarah to-morrow morning and shall probably anchor there for the night. Dated Bahrein, the 12th August 1895. jyom Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, to—Commander Djemal Bey , Turkish Corvette Zuhaf. Information has reached me that an act of piracy has taken place on the west side of Easht -al -Debel on Thursday evening last in the seizure of a 24.Bahrein pearling boat by Ahmad-bin-Salman, the same person who cut off the hand of a British Indian subject on the 26th July. It appears that he went alongside the pearling boat in a small boat with four men and threatened to kill any who offered resistance to him. He took pos session of the boat, turning its crew into the small boat and sailed the boat with all its contents towards the mainland. This man having taken refuge in territory under Turkish authority, I have the honour to request that he may be brought to justice for both these offences, and that the boat and contents be returned to the owner and compen sation made. I am reporting this serious act of piracy to the Home Government, and it is hoped that you will be able to suppress further aggressions of this kind. Dated 5th August 1895. From— Shaikh Esa , Chief of Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. After Compliments. —Let it not be hidden from you that on their arrival at Bahrein, Salim-bin-Uamad and his followers begged for protection and promised to bring their families and effects to Bahrein. In addition to the protection, assurances and honour were bestowed upon them. After this the ' Naib Sahib ' ordered ten boats to be sent to Zobarah to bring the families of these persons, and in compliance w T ith these instructions the boats were sent; but on their arrival at Zobarah Shaikh Jasim ordered the Turkish soldiers to seize them and they did so and hauh'd up the boats after removing the gear and sails, and for this reason I am very sad. I had sanguine hopes in God and the British Government. The Sphinx left for Zobarah, and I was anxiously expecting that she should take the necessary steps to release them from Jasim's hands. After the third day she returned, leaving them there in trouble. In the meantime two of the crew of these boats escaped and came to me and represented the troubles, ill-treatment and the starvation to which their comrades were subjected, and that the people of Zobarah would not pro vide them with anything. I have hopes in the kindness of Government that their grievances may be looked into and they may be freed. I also beg to state that reliable information is constantly being received of Jasim's actions to cause disorder and his collecting a large number of villains from the Bedouins and others, and his intention to surprise Bahrein. He had given out that he was waiting for an opportunity for this purpose, but I hope by the power of God and yours, he will be repelled in hopelessness. It has become necessary to request you to bestow your kind attention to this matter. Under any circumstances the order rests with God and your self. Telegram dated Bushire, the 28th August 1895. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. There is no change by mail. Gaskin fears attack. I still doubt serious attack. I propose to reply. Mutasarrif absolutely rejecting disclaimer, in sisting fullest responsibility and refusing remove British subjects. Lawrence could ^take letter. May Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, employ service, if he has to act? No cargo landed Bahrein. Future shipments stopped.

Bo not answer the Mutasarrif's letter without further instructions and do not attempt to rescue the Bahrein 2526 boats from Zobarah. We have at present no authority from Her Majesty's Government to do more than protect Bahrein. Telegram, No. 1669-E , dated Simla, the 1st September 1895. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—The Secretary of State, London. Secret. Foreign, The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has been written to by the Mutasarrif of ilasa who accuses him of breaking the peace of the Nejd coast by seizing boats ; warns him that Katr people feel impelled to attack Bahrein; states that he lias restrained tliem hitherto, but cannot restrain them longer; asks for the return of the boats seized by Commander Pelly, and advises the removal of British subjects from Bahrein vuthin seven teen days from 19t.h August. f lhe Political liesident proposes to reply that the fullest responsibility rests on Turkish ollicials. He also advises the release by force of Bahrein boats whose detention at Zobaiah was reported in my telegram of the 27th July. I have told him to take no action in either case pending instructions. Has the remonstrance suggested in my telegram, dated the 4th August last, been sent by Her Majesty's Government to the Porte, and if the action recommended can be taken w r ith certainty of success would Her Majesty's Government permit it ? [Confidential.) 'No. 89, dated Bushire, the 24-th August 1895. From— C olonel F. A. W ilson , Political Resident in thf* Persian Gulf. To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. 1 hove the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your two telegrams of the 22nd instant. The necessary communication has been made to Com mander Pelly regarding his action in the event of hostile demonstration against Bahrein. A copy of Commander Pelly's last despatch* received yesetrday is enclosed ., , for the information of Government: no • Dated 22ud August with enclosure. j. r • x i i t • event or importance has occurred during the week, and the situation appears to be not materially changed. Some signi-- ficance may, however, attach to the rumour of warnings to his subordinates by the Mutasarrif against an attack on Bahrein, as possibly indicating a caution from the Ottoman Government to its representatives, against acts that would more seriously compromise it. 2. Should there be truth in this rumour, the general position disclosed is in no way improved, and is in my opinion exceedingly unsatisfactory. For the Mudir at Zjbarah and the Commander of the Turkish vessel Zuhaf having both declared Shaikh Jasim (presumably as Kaim Makam of Katr) their superior, the reported instructions to them, would indicate a confusion and uncertainty of authority, and a consequent irresponsibility in action, of a dan gerous character. In this connection, i have to report the further information which has reached me, of a letter from the Mutasarrif of Hasa to Shaikh Esa, stating that in reply to his orders for the arrest of the pirate Ahmad-bin- Salman, he had learned that the man was a Bahreini. Such an apology, when the occasion demands the most strenuous efforts to arrest this ruffian, is an insult to reason, the man having left Bahrein for Turkish territory, here he has since resided, 18 months ago. 3. It seems to me so gravely open to doubt whether Jasim can rightly be regarded as a responsible officer of the Ottoman Government, and our position resulting from this doubt, and the attitude of the local Turkish officials gene rally, has become so unsatisfactory and indeed intolerable, that I venture to submit a course of action for consideration I do this with the utmost diffidence, having regard to my ignorance of the views of the Government of Indiain communicatioii with Her Majesty's Secretary of State on the whole question, and of the international considerations which, in their opinion, may be involved. I would accordingly ask that my suggestion be tfiken rather as one for a course which appears to me direct and practicable in the event of a decision to adopt extreme measures, than as distinct proposal in the existing circumstances. I would submit then that after such communication to the Porte as may be deemed fit Shaikh Jasim's relation to that Government should be ignored, and that in view of his wanton association of himself with matters between Bahrein and a section of its disaffected people, and in pursuance of the deliberate warning addressed to him at the outset of the present difficulty, he should be directly dealt with. That an ultimatum should be addressed to him demandins the instant restoration of the Bahrein boats unwarrantably held in detention at Zobarah, and his withdrawal together with his follow T ers and any Bedouins or others under his influence, from Zobarah and its immediate neigh bourhood, on pain of operations by force of arms to be directed against him on or after a given date, whatever might be decided, including Al-Bidaa. From a careful study of the chart, and my observation at a former visit to the locality, as well as from other sources of information, I have been led to the conclusion that Al-Bidaa is one of the few places on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, which is especially liable to effective naval attack without mili- tarv support. The presence of a detachment of Turkish troops is the only objection,—and that from a political rather than a military point of view, of which I am aware,—to operations against Al-Bidaa. These troops might be called upon to retire before the operations against Jasim. Zobarah is not so open to attack, owing to shoal water, but might nevertheless be probably effectively shelled from the sea. Dated Bahrein, the 22nd August 1895. From— C aptain J. H. P elly , Commander and Senior Officer, To Colonel F. A. Wilson , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, I have the honour to further inform you as follows The messenger who took my letter concerning Shaikh Salim's family, was warned by the Commander of the Zuhafnot to appear at Zobarah again, and in consequence Shaikh Esa thought it inadvisable to send my second letter there concerning the reported act of piracy. I have received an answer to my first letter, a copy of which I enclose, desiring me in future to address the Mutasarrif of El-Hasa. It is reported that the pirate Ahmad-bin-Salman has seized a pearling boat belonging to Jasim's following. Authentic news has been received that the Zuhaf left Zobarah on the morning of the 19th and reached Katif on the following day. It is rumoured that the Mutasarrif has written to Jasim warning him against attacking Bahrein, also to the Commander of the Zuhaf and to the Mudir to prevent Jasim in any attempt upon Bahrein. Shaikh Esa has received a letter from El-Hasa stating that the Mutasarrif has written to Nasir -bin-Mubarak, demanding the arrest of the pirate Ahmad- bin -Salman, but Nasir replied to the effect that this man is a Bahreini. Coal lighters have just arrived and I intend coaling to-morrow. Dated Zobarah, the 13th August 1895. From— D jemal , Commander, H. I. O. M. Ship Zuhaf y rj&gt; 0 Captain J. H. Pelly , Commander, H.
