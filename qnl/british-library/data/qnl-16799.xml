It stresses that in the process, the Resident should not force Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat, to adopt any measures which may lead to disturbances in his dominions, or the resumption of piracy within the Persian Gulf.Enclosed with the letter is a translation of a communication from Muhummed bin Allee [Muḥammad bin ‘Alī], Chief of the Beni Boo Ali to the Governor of Bombay, dated 15 July 1823, which informed the Governor that he has arrived at Muscat and was as well received there as he was at Bombay.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711598.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
