Minute Paper. political Department. &lt;^3 , ^ r* In paragraph 4 of their letter of 30th March y« 1931 (flagged in the attached A*G. Pile), the Foreign Office queried their liability to bear a moiety of the cost of the temporary retention of the Quarantine Medical Officer at JLingah during the transition period of the transference of the Quarantine Service to the Persian Governmai t during 1928-29, They did this in view of the Government of India’s telegram of 18th July 1928 lP,2633/28-flagged in bound volume) in which the Government of India stated 'we are prepared to finance the quarantine ourselves for say 6 months' (i.e, during the transition period) - a statement which the Foreign Office interpreted as an undertaking by the Government of India to bear the whole cost of the temporary retention of the Quarantine Medical Officer, In this connexion attention is invited to the A.G’s, reference to this Department, and to this Department’s reply (flagged at Y in the A.G. file) in which we expressed the view that the Foreign Office interpretation' was correct and that accordingly there was no reason to take the matter up with the Foreign Office. The A.G. Department thereupon infoimed the Government of India in paragraph 4 of their letter of 29th April 1931 ( flag £ in A.G. file) that the Foreign Office interpretation appeared to be correct and the Government of India letter now submitted is a reply to that paragraph. The Government of India argue that the Quarantine Medical Officers at Bandar Abbas and Dingah were retained up to 31st January 1929 with the sanction of the Secretary of State in his telegram iMo,2027, dated 21st July 1928 (P.3777/28 - flagged in bound volume), but this telegram does not really determine the j 115 b (looo 10 31the date of expiry of the appointments. JMevertheless it may be held to sanction in a general way the proposals made for handing over Quarantine responsibility including the Government of India's suggestion that the outgoing officers might be 'retained for say 6 months to see that quarantine regulations are properly carried out and give the new regime a fair start ' (vide their telegram of 18th July 1928, P.3749/28), flawed. It is undoubtedly the case that the foreign Office raised no objection to the retention of the Assistant Surgeon at Bandar Abbas for 6 months up to 31s)t January 1929 on exactly the same grounds as at Lingah and the marginal correction in the A.G. minute just below Y A.G. file) and the reference to P.6152/3 0 (flagged in bound volume) are an error as the correspondence under P.6152/30 refers not to the period in question, but to the succeeding period from 1st February onwards (see telegram from Government of India,^P.7613/29 flagged). It is true that the Government of indisiwith in Ju. 'trlAr*) * )' J- ua* Mr.Northcott 1 s minute^made no request that the foreign Office should bear a moiety of the expenditure assuming, they say, that it would follow the incidence of expenditure on account of the Medical Officer at Bandar Abbas, and in view of Government of India's telegram of 21st May 1928 (P.2633/28) the Foreign Office might have; refused even to share expenditure at Bandar Abbas for the 6 months in question. Nevertheless as the Foreign Office have been inconsistent, the Government of India*s^ case is, I think, worth taking up with them. The sum at stake is not very large (-§• of Rs.3,850), but on general grounds of equity, the Government of India should not be made to bear the whole cost. It is unfortunate that they/Minute Paper.

Accountant-General, H5h 3000 10 31Minute Paper. Department. 415b :u)00 10/31 I do not altogether agree with the pre ceding minutes and the G. of I's reasoning appears to me to be faulty. The Lingah case is not on all fours with that of Bynder Abbas. At the latter place it was decided after the transfer of the quarantine i arrangements and with F.O. concurrence (obtained with difficulty) to retain the appointment of a medical officer - first the Assistant Surgeon temporarily^ and then a sub-Assistant Surgeon permanently for, the_ medical, needs, con sul fit there could therefore have been no question of the cost of the appointment not being divisible from In ic if the date when Persia stopped paying for it/as a quarantine post, ^ ^ ^ A- 44 ^, ^ f At Lingeh on the other hand the quarantine officer and consular agent had no medical duties after transfer of the quarantine and as he had little to do as consular agent the appointment was abolished. As quarantine officer he had been paid by Persia and had apparently received no pay as | Consular agent though there were certain small divisible expenses in connexion with this side of his duties. In considering who should pay for his salary during the quarantine overlap period, therefore, the only question that arises is the incidence of the cost of the quarantine service during that period, and as regards this the G. of I. had stated in their telegraiji of 21 May, 1928, that 'in view of the interests of India' they were prepared to finance it for six months. TheThe G. of I. are not on much stronger ground in para. 2 of their letter. For though the appointment of consular agent was not actually abolished till the end of the quarantine overlap period and it might be contended that while it existed the cost of it is divisible, the fact remains that the incumbent had received no pay in the past as Consular agent and that his main functions and the whole of his emoluments had been those of quarantine officer. If we have a claim, it would seem best to drop the Bunder ftbbas analogy and rest it on the equity of sharing the cost of transitional arrangements made to avoid a breakdown in the quarantine service. If you agree I suggest that one of the following alternatives might be adopted:- (l) merely to forward the G. of I*s letter to the F.O. without enthusiasm, (2) to say that v while we do not quite agree with the G. of I. that the Lingah case is in pari materia- with that at Bunder Abbas 'we suggest that the cost of the transitional arrangement made to prevent a breakdown at the time of the transfer of the service to Persia ought to be shared, despite the obiter dictum in the G. of I’s telegram of 21 May 1928 which was never taken up.

Sir, Ui.&lt;n 4 fSg I am directed to refer to paragraph 4 of letter from the Under Secretary of State for India, Accountant General’s Department Uo.A.G*3903, dated the 29th April 1931, and to say &gt; A' v ■ that the quarantine Medical Officers at Bandar Abbas and Lingah vvere retained during the period of transfer of the quarantine service in the Persian Gulf to the Persian Government with the sanction of the Secretary of State for India, vide his telegram Uo.2027, dated the 21st July 1928. This sanction expired on 31st January 1929. The approval of the Secretary of State to the continuance of the appointment of the Medical Officer, Bandar Abbas, was sought in Government of India’s telegram Uo* 847-U, dated the 27th November 1929. No reference to the Medical Officer, Lingah, was however made in that telegram as his retention there as such after 31st January was not consider ed necessary. Dr.E.R.Hill, I.M.D. quarantine Medical Officer, was also in charge of Hie Consular Agency, the closure of which was under consideration at the time and he actually left Lingah on Hie 28th May 1929, the date on which the Consular Agency was closed down. As stated in India Office letter No. ,^dated the 2nd October 1930, the Foreign Office had agreedagreed to bear a moiety of the cost involved in the future maintenance of the post of Medical Officer, Bandar Abbas, as v/ell as a moiety of the cost involved in the temporary retention of why the Foreign Office propose to base the incidence of the cost of the maintenance of the post of Medical Officer, Lingah, after the transfer of the quarantine arrangement to the Persian Go vernment* on Government of Indian telegram 1 TOo 1020-S, da ted the 21st kay 1928. Ko request that the Foreign Office should r - — bear a moiety of the expenditure in question was made as it was assumed that it would follow the incidence of expenditure on account of the Medical Officer at Bandar Abbas, 2. Moreover for the period from 1st August 1928- the date on which quarantine arrangements were handed over to the Persian medical staff, to 31st January 1929 the quarantine Medical Officer at Lingah was also the Consular Agent of the Lingah Agency and as the entire expenditure in connection therewith was divisible, the Government of India consider that the Foreign Office refusal to bear a moiety of the Consular Agents pay is unjustifiable, 3, I am to request therefore that if the Secretary of State for India sees no objection the Foreign Office may be asked to re-consider their decision in this matter, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, the Medical Officer there.

Sir, YJith reference to your letter of the 12th March, No. T.A.Divl.7 of 30-31/1367, I am directed to observe as follows:- 4. Lingah - Assistant Surgeon. The interpretation placed upon the telegram from the Government of India referred to by the Foreign Office appears correct and accordingly involves the deletion of a moiety of the sum of Rs.3,850 from the claim by this Office.i Minute Paper. Department. iT'JSA Accountant General, Your reference of the 17th April. I think the Foreign Oilice are right about the Assistant Surgeon at Lingah, having regard to the Government of India’s | statement (telegram dated 21st May 1928 - P.2633/28) ! that 'in view of interests of India we are prepared to finance the quarantine ourselves for, say, six months”. As the Foreign Office point out, His Majesty’s Government were never asked whether they were willing to bear half the cost - it will be seen from the Government of India's letter dated 15th December 1928 to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (P.160/29) that they sanctioned the expenditure on their own authority. In these circumstances I see no reason why this Department should take the matter up with the Foreign Office. I have no observations to offer in regard to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Foreign Office letter. S.C. of statement of expenditure has been retained. (Sd.) J.G.

In their letter dated 30th March, A.G.3863/31 flagged, the Foreign Office raise queries on the Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persian account for 1928-29. Reference is invited to paragraph 4 in which enquiry is made as to whether it was not the intention of the Government of India to bear the cost of continuing for six months the quarantine staff in the Gulf after the formal transfer of the service to Persia. In forwarding the Indian statement for the year, a spare copy of which is annexed for retention, this Department quoted as reference against the charge of Rs.3,850 for the Assistant Surgeon^ pay (under Lingah) Political Department letter P.3777/28 dated 21st July 1928 to the Foreign Office. The Political Secretary will presumably deal with this paragraph of the Foreign Oflice letter, (*the enquiry in which seems to apply equally to the question of the retention of the Assistant Surgeon at Bandar Abbas, to which no allusion is made). Has the Political Secretary any observations to offer on paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Foreign Office letter before the points in these and the remainder of the letter are taken up with the Indian authorities?

I am to state that this telegram was interpreted as an undertaking by the Government of India to bear the whole cost of the temporary retention of the quarantine Medical Officer during the transition period of ' the transference of the quarantine Service to the Government ofj Persia.
