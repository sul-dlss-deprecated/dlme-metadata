Barclay G U L A H E K. October 3rd, 1911. Sir:- I have the honour to inform you that a meeting of the Sanitary Council at which I took the chair, was held yesterday October 2nd at Tehran, Dr. Feistmantel the Austrian Delegate has gone to Europe on leave. Dr. Amadeo the Ottoman delegate has \ just returned from Europe, but' he wrote to say that he expected to leave at once for Beirut where his family live, oh account of the outbreak of war between Italy s and Turkey (Dr. Amadeo is an Italian). He therefore asked me to take over his duties which I had just re linquished, having succeeded Dr. Feistmantel when he went on leave, in the discharge of them. Cholera in Southern Persia . Moharamerah, Nasseri, Ahwaz, Disful, Shuster, Ram Hormuz, Behbehan and Malamir have all been infected in turn. At the present moment Nasseri, Ahwaz and Shuster are free and the epidemic is almost extinct at Mohammerah and Disful. Behbehan and Malamir have however been attacked. The Council therefore decided to: Place1. Place an observation at Dopulan (6 stages from Isfahan on the Lynch road). 2. Place similar stations between Behbehan and Shiraz and the same place and Isfahan. This will hardly be practicable on account of the disorders in Pars, and in any case will be of doubtful benefit. Kasr i Shirin. Two cases of cholera were reported on September 9th. Since then communication with that place has been impossible. Isfahan. The two cases of cholera reported in my memorandum in the last meeting proved on enquiry to be cases of severe gastro-enteritis Cholera in Russia. The number of cases is slowly increasing. Cases occur from time to time at Baku and Astrakan. The medical visit in the Caspian ports will therefore be continued. In this connection the Council has had to complain over and over again of the inadequacy of the information supplied by the Persian representatives abroad. The Foreign Office has assured me that the necessary in structions have been given but things are as bad as ever. The Council had to complain at its last meeting of thethe conduct of the Russian Consular Agent at Enzeli who with the commander of a gunboat insisted on boarding ships before the port doctor. On representations being made to the Russian Legation the infringement of the quarantine rules ceased. The Sanitary Stations at Enzeli and Astara are making good progress in spite of the fact that three nearly finished sheds at Enzeli collapsed the other day. This is an instance of the difficulty of getting things done in this country for there is little room for doubt that the contractor purposely made them wrong so that they should fall and his 'job” be prolonged. Sanitary Conference of Paris . Dr. Emir Khan, the second Persian delegate, told me the other day that he could not leave for various reasons. The real reason is that the Treasurer General has re fused to make the necessary grant for the delegates* expenses (Tomans 1000). Persia will therefore be re presented by Dr. Georges and Dr. Ardeshir Khan, a Persian doctor practising in Paris. TheThe Vaccination Service. The first campaign has closed with a record of 14 440 vaccinations performed at a cost of 19 shahis each and with a balance of Tomans 500 odd at the Bank. The winter campaign will shortly begin. The Finance Commission has met three times since August 17th. I read Its report to the meeting and it was unanimously adopted. The following is a list of the funds disposed of by the Council 1. President's expenses. Tomans 500 a year l.e. printing, stationery farrashes &amp;c., Persian Interpreter. Tomans 300 a year. French Speaking Mlrsa. Tomans 360 a year. 4. Quarantine expenses in Russian 'Zone' a fixed charge on the Customs receipts. Tomans 15,000. 5. The tenoh part of the taxes on means of locomo- Taxes collected at Kermanshah on dead bodies tion, average Tomans 240 a month, earmarked for the public vaccination service. (Krans 7 a body). Earmarked for the construction of a lazaret at Kasr i Shirin. The expenses of the local Sanitary3 Sanitary delegate of the Ministry of the Interior and of a local hospital are paid out of the receipts. The bal ance once reached Tomans 1200 hut is now diminishing. The Finance Commission has accepted a proposal to increase the tax to Krans 15 per body. In any case it will be necessary to draw on the Tomans 15,000 a year if the lazaret is to be constructed in this century. The tax is collected by the Customs. I have taken the first steps to begin the lazaret and hope that a start may be possible next spring. 7. A sum of Tomans 20,000 was voted by the Mejlias in December last for the construction of quarantine stations on the Caspian. Half of this has been expended It will be observed that quarantine expenses in the South of Persia do not appear in this list. They are being paid as heretofore directly by the Southern Cus toms. Whereas the above amounts v/hich formerly were paid by the Central Customs Administration are now being paid by the Treasury to the Council. The Customs still act however as the latter*s agents in the provinces.1 o onfidential.

The most convenient route to Bussorah being by sea via Bombay, the commission of the Constantinople Board of Health will probably proceed by that route. On return journey, Clemow, who will be a member of the commission, proposes to separate from his colleagues, who will come and go by quick steamer, whereas he will go in private capacity to Bombay by slow steamer calling at Gulf ports. His proposal is being considered. [2231 u—l] /t.Paraphrase No.3, of Telegram from Sir G. Barclay, Commercial, dated 13th. October, Tehran, 1911. Despatch No.180 Commercial from Constantinople. Reserve Surgeon at Bushire has been informed by Dr. Clemow that he intends this winter to visit the Persian Gulf. This suggested visit will no doubt follow as a sequel to Cleraow's visit to the Turco- Persian frontier as a member of Constantinople Board of Health. If Clemow comes unofficially to examine situa tion with the Reserve Burgeon His Majesty's Consul at Bushire has no objection to make. Controversial questions, hov/ever, such as that of international sanitary station will certainly be raised if he comes as member of Constantinople Board or as Commissioner of Board. These views are fully concurred in. I shall be glad to be supplied with fuller information regarding Clemow's proposed visit to the Gulf, as I fully concur in views held by Consul General.py- Tt 7). LONDON, October 15th, 1911. My dear Law:- A copy of Sir G. Barclay^ telegram, / No. 5 Commercial of the 13th. instant, has been sent me by Mr. Sargent, who asks me to explain to you how matters stand in regard to my proposed visit to the Persian Gulf this winter. So far as I can recall at this moment, my mention of this was quite incidental in a letter written to the Surgeon at Bushire on another matter. The nature and object of the Commission of the Board of Health were fully explained in my des patches No. 66 of May 5th. and No. 106 of July 10th. last - copies of both of which were, no doubt, sent home. That Commission is charged merely to visit Basra and the land frontier (southern portion) between Turkey and Persiaj it would nave nothing to do with the Gulf ports; and, if it called at any of them, in going to or returning from Basra, if would, of coarse, be merely as ordinary travellers whose steamers happened to touch there, and in no official c^pacioy whateverI whatever. If as seems likely, I am a member of that Commission, I shall be personally glad of the oppor~ tunity of making the acquaintance of the English medi cal officers in the various ports - with some of whom I have frequently corresponded - and it was in that sense, no doubt that (so far as I can remember, with“ out my archives to refer to) I mentioned the matter, in passing, in my letter to the medical officer at Bushire. I hope this makes the matter clear. If it is thought desirable that the other members of the Com mission should not visit the gulf ports at all - even as ordinary travellers - it could perhaps be managed, either by our choosing the land route, instead of the sea route, to Bagdad and Basra; or, if that is im possible, by our taking a quick steamer from Bombay to Basra, one calling at few ports and making short stays in them. I could then, perhaps, separate from my colleagues for the return journey (after completing our work at Basra and on the land frontier), and return to Bombay by a slow steamer.I must acid that I should regret exceedingly if, once in those regions, I were prevented from visiting \ some of the Gulf ports, ana making the acquaintance of the officers stationed there, and from learning some- thing of the local conditions prevailing there.

It was resolved that there was but a slender basis for such a theory.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] WITH reference to my despatch No. 15 of the 12th July, I have the honour to transmit herein copy of a report compiled by the physician to His Majesty’s legation on the ninety-third meeting of the Sanitary Council held at Tehran on the -list July. As will he observed from Dr. Neligan’s report, the note of Dr. JPeistmantel, which elicited a protest from Captain McConaghy, the chief medical officer in the Gulf, was satisfactorily disposed of, with little credit to its author. I HAVE the honour to submit to you a report of the ninety-third meeting of the Sanitary Council held at Tehran on the 31st July, myself in the chair. Plague in the Persian Gulf. —The epidemic, which has carried off about 2,000 people, has come to an end, and directions to raise the quarantine were telegraphed to the Gulf Sanitary Service on the 4th July. ' Cholera in Cholera appeared at Semara about the middle of June. ^By the middle of July it had reached Baku and Astrakhan, hut the cases have been few, and the epidemic on the whole very much milder than that of last year. The council decided to institute a medical visit for all ships arriving in Persian ports from Astrakhan and Baku. # Cholera in Turkey and in the Persian Gulf. —Cholera broke out in the neighbour hood of Amara on the Tigris on the 15th June. On the 15th July it appeared at Bussorah, and on the 25th two cases occurred on board the Persian gun-boat “ Persepolis ” at Mohammerah. A few cases have been notified from Bagdad. Arrivals from the latter at Kasr-i-Shirin undergo a medical visit, and quarantine was declared against Turkey in all the Persian ports of the Gulf on the 24th July, and against Mohammerah on the 27th July. A quarantine station has been foimed at Ahwaz, under the charge of the assistant surgeon attached to our consulate. The Quarantine Stations at Enzeli and at Astara.—The works are now being carried out without interruption. The Austrian Delegate and the origin of recent epidemics of Plague in the Persian Gulf.—Dr. Eeistmantel read a note on this subject at the ninetieth meeting of the council held on the 1st May last. On the 17th June Captain McConaghy, I.M.S., chief medical officer in the Gulf, sent a telegram to the Sanitary Council, protesting against the note. Hr. Eeistmantel was not present at the meeting held on the 3rd July, and I therefore, as stated in my report of that meeting, put off reading the telegram until this meeting. Colonel Cox sent a copy of Captain McConaghy s telegram to His Majesty’s legation on the 17th June (Bushire telegram No. 132), and on the 18th June he wrote a detailed despatch (No. 51) on the questions raised by Dr. Feistmantel’s note. In the telegram in question Captain McConaghy— 1. Pointed out that as far as the epidemic at Lingah in 1904 was concerned, the note was simply an inaccurate copy of an appendix written by Dr. Bussffiie to the report of Dr. Eaivre on the “ Defense sanitaire du Golfe Persique ” (1906). ^ That the details there given were exaggerated and not authoritative, lhat the official reports of the Gulf Sanitary Service gave a very different (less) mortality.

Showed that the statement that the epidemic of plague at Bushire in iqiq was caused by the importation of a cargo of old bedding from Bahrein had no basis • in. fact, he had declared categorically in his report on the epidemic that though the origin of the outbreak was obscure, it certainly could not be traced to Bahrein. ° 3. Protested against use being made of unofficial reports when there were officiaS reports ready to hand. ^ ^ Dr. Peistmantel read a long reply to this telegram. He had only one object in writing his original note, and that was to clear up if possible the origin of the epidemics in question. As to the Lingah epidemic, he had no source of information other than the report of Dr. Paivre, which was published under the auspices of the Drench Government. As regards the epidemic of 1910, he had forgotten Captain McConaghy’s report, and had remembered only his statement that the first case had fallen ill ten days after his arrival from Bahrein at Bushire. His statement about the old bedding was taken from an authoritative source. (A report by Dr. Listeman, the German consul at Bushire, and consistent meddler in quarantine affairs.—A. B. N.) Finally, though of course due weight must be given to the official reports received by the Sanitary Council, foreign delegates would always reserve to themselves the right to use other sources of information. In my reply I showed by references to the reports concerned that Captain McConaghy’s statements were correct, I had, however, to own that the council possessed no official information about the Lingah epidemic, for it was reconstituted m October, and the epidemic ended in June. I did not press the fact of its beino- “ inexact,” for the extracts are correctly quoted, though their order is chaimed 0 . However, Dr. Deistmantel looked sufficiently foolish when it was shown that what he had written was not only the ideas but the words of somebody else, unadorned bv inverted commas. J Finally, I insisted on the fact that though the council was ready to receive and discuss reports derived from all possible sources, it could accept as authoritative only those turmshed by its own officials, especially in the case of the Gulf, where the leisian Government bad an organised sanitary service. Dr. Deistmantel made no reply, and the meeting expressed itself in agreement with my remarks. ° nTul 5 n f al a f a P h of Pi ;- Feistmantel’s note then came up for discussion, doino. i !t re fh re i t0 °Vv e °PP 0I i fcun ^ of reptymg to the various points raised.

Complaints referred to in second paragraph as well as others pointing to Russian consuls in Persia favouring ex-Shah’s cause and to intrigues of many reactionaries residing in Zerguendeh have heen brought to my notice by the Persian Government. In most cases Persian Government avoid following these up with Russian Minister, so that anything I may say to him in regard to them falls flat. Persian Government have not complained to Russian Minister in regard to consulate-general’s alleged intrigues and collection of money for ex-Shah, so that I can hardly think that they could substantiate charge. Disobedience of Cossack brigade : There have been frequent complaints that colonel has refused to furnish guns and 'ammunition and to send Cossacks to the provinces, but I am inclined to think these unreasonable, and that colonel, before ex-Shah’s return, for Government purposes outside Tehran already denuded himself of guns, ammunition, and men so far as was consistent with maintenance of cadres of the brigade. Apart from legation guards there are only about 400 Cossacks in Tehran, or just sufficient to form a nucleus of the three branches, infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Russian Minister ridiculed notion of Russian naval officers accompanying the ex-Shah and of Russian staff officers assisting His Majesty. I am now enquiring of His Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed. It is generally admitted that ex-Shah crossed the Caspian in a Russian tramp from Petrovsk. A Baku newspaper, “Caspian,” publishes an interview with captain of a disabled schooner which tramp rescued. Captain states that it was observed theie were passengers on board tramp-well- dressed Europeans and Persians of standing; and_ in despatch which should reach you on Monday vice-consul at Resht reports that it is said that His Majesty had with him seventy packages, mostly containing arms and ammunition. As regards general question of connivance of Russia, 1 would refer to my private telegram c§ 25th' July and to Sir E. Cartwright’s telegram No. SO, Secret paragraph. Russian Minister observed at the table, early in July, that we should soon have ex-Shah back. I did not attach importance to this remark at the time, as he would hardly have talked about ex-Shah’s return had he known it to be impending. Cossack officers, I am told, also used same language, but the wish may well have been father to the thought, and the unparalleled state of disorders in the country made such talk natural. It is perhaps unfortunate that ex-Shah’s return synchronised with the development of Shuster’s activities, which were so unwelcome to Russia.CONFIDENTIAL U 28 AUG 1911 iDm&amp;y Sir G.

Persian consul at Baku reports that Sardar Assad, a friend of Amir Bahadur, and two companions have arrived at Baku with arms and ammunition, and are giving out that ex-Shah will return to Persia in a fortnight. I understand from Russian Minister that these men have been arrested by Russian authorities. It might be well to warn ex-Shah, who is, 1 believe, in Vienna, against intriguing.

Tehran, August 26, 1911, 10'30 a.m. YOUR telegram No. 246 [of 23rd August], Shuster thinks, and I entirely concur, that there should be only one gendarmerie. ) Treasury gendarmerie should suffice for all purposes. Shuster hopes in time to be i able to send 4,000 men to Shiraz for guarding the road and the collection of taxes in lars at present not a [?] twelfth reaches the central Government from that province— but this can only be done within measurable time if Shuster has Major Stokes’s services for some months in the capital. Shuster thinks that for men not conversant with Persian language and conditions organisation of a gendarmerie of any value would take at least two years, by which time, if taxes are not collected, Persia will be irrevocably bankrupt. Suggestion, therefore, that he should entrust formation of his gendarmerie to the Swedes does not appeal to him, though he looks to merging them into the force later on. I fear that Swedes, even if they could reach Bushire, would not be able within reasonable time to organise anything effective for dealing [?] with road. Moreover, ! Bushire-Shiraz section is fairly safe. It is the Shiraz-Ispahan section that cries loudest for protection, and the robber bands infesting it are, I think, too strong to be dealt with by armed muleteers. With Shuster taking gendarmerie in hand a remedy for roads is in sight, and if only Major Stokes can be kept in Tehran for a time prospect of this remedy is not so remote, and the British firms may take comfort. [731-443][This Document is the Property of His Britgimic Majesty's Government,]^ (No. 180. Commercial.) Sir, Therapia, July 13, 1911. I HAVE the honour to forward herewith a despatch from the British delegate ^ on the Board of Health reporting that it has been decided to send two sanitary missions to the Turco-Persian frontier. Dr. Clemow asks permission to form part of the southern mission which will proceed early next year to the vilayets of Mosul, Bagdad, and Bussorah, and in view AS reported in my despatch No. 66* of the 5th May last, the Board of Health frontier, in order to study on the spot the sanitary defence of that frontier. The details of the proposed expedition were referred to the Lazarets Committee, whose report was read to the Board on the 9th May. That committee proposed that the northern part of the frontier should form the object of one mission, and the southern part, with Bussorah, that of a separate mission. It was further decided that the it was decided that the northern mission should start very shortly, and the French and Persian delegates and Dr. Rifaat Bey, the Inspecteur de Service, were elected members of this mission. They were asked to prepare the programme of their expedition, and this was submitted to, and accepted by, the Board on the 27th June. I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of this programme.” It will be seen that the northern mission will deal only with the frontiers of the Erzeroum and Van vilayets, leaving those of Mosul, Bagdad, and Bussorah to the southern mission. It is expected that they will start before the end of the present month. In the report of the Lazarets Committee read to the Board on the 9th May, alluded to above, it was proposed that the southern mission should consist of the Persian and British delegates and Dr. Akil Mukhtar Bey ; but the final decision on this point has been adjourned until the time draws nearer when the mission can start. In view of the fact that some 90 per cent, of shipping at Bussorah is under the British flag (quite apart from the important political considerations that would have to be constantly borne in mind), the propriety, indeed the necessity, of the British delegate being a member of this mission would seem to be unquestionable. The alternative to this would be the dispatch of a mission in which British interests were not represented in any w’ay, while it might easily happen that one or more of the members of the mission would be actually unfriendly to British interests. I have the honour to request, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government may be informed of the decision to send such mission, and that their permission may be obtained to my forming part of it. It is thought that the mission may start early next year, so that it would not in any way clash with the International Conference in Paris, which, it will be recalled, was adjourned until the 10th October. My German colleague is making very active efforts to be included in this mission, EASTERN SANITARY REFORMS. [July 24.] CONFIDENTIAL.

On the 20th June [2109 rta—Hi \ If and states that his chief attaches much importance to his being so, in view of the future importance of the regions to be visited, in connection with the completion of the Bagdad Railway. From the purely practical point of view, however, it has to be stated that the object of the mission will be solely a sanitary one, and that the German delegate (M. de Schoenberg, dragoman of the German Embassy) not beino- medical man, his presence on the mission could not add in any way to the efficiency of the latter. Moreover, the mission wdll be almost solely occupied with the sanitary defence of Bussorah, and the actual line of the Turko-Persian frontier (southern portion). It will no doubt visit Bagdad and other places in the neighbourhood, but the sanitary measures there are an internal matter, and do not concern the Board of ] Health. The completion of the railway, when effected, will no doubt raise new questions of measures of sanitary defence, but it will affect scarcely, if at all the measures at Bussorah and along the frontier. Fven if the line, or a branch of it is prolonged across that frontier, it seems to be generally admitted that it will pass through Khanikin; and it is there that, in any case, the main sanitary barrier will exist, as it does at present. It is also thought that that branch, if created, would be under Russian rather than German influence. So that the existence of German interests in the portion of the frontier that the mission would visit seems to be very far from proved ; while at Bussorah (where the most really useful and fruitful work of the mission may be expected to be done) German interests may be almost said not to exist at all, or to be represented solely by the occasional visit to Bussorah of a German steamer. (In 1909-10 there were nine such steamers; they paid P38 per cent, of the total dues received in this branch of the sanitary service.) Mhile the above views are shared by many other members of the Board, there are apparently not a few who will support the German delegate’s candidature. * If he is elected, the Russian delegate—who has undoubtedly considerable interests in those regions—will very possibly insist also on being included. A mission thus composed, of five members, would be not only unwieldily large, but most unnecessarily costly. I have, &amp;c. F. G. CLEMOW. Enclosure 2 in No. 1.

In May last eight cases of plague were imported from Beb&amp;i,of which two cases died, but no epidemic occurred* 3* The theory put forward by Br* FeistmanteX that plague may be attributed to the sorting and cleaning of pearl shells in the spring is, I think, hopelessly inaccurate, and I have never heard it suggested before* During the months of April to July, when, according to Dr. Feistmantel, plague is preval- -ent in the Gulf, the pearl shell trade is at a stan^ill at hingah. Pearl shells from the Shib Kuh Coast and islands commence to arrive at lingah in July and shipments are general* -ly completed by Hovember. 4. With regard to the probable origin of plague in the Persian Gulf, I think the theory held by Dr. Brumby, ^uar&amp;n- -tine Medical Officer,experience in the Gulf since 1905,is sound. It is that plague is imported by rice steamers from Calcutta. Dr. Brumby cites the outbreak of plague at Bahrein in 1907 in proof of his theory and states that it broke out in epidemic form at Bahrein just a fortnight after the arrival of i?.fe* ^Onda* with a cargo of rice from Calcutta* And he states^it was rumoured at the time,s*d several rats had died on board**®- during the. ships voyage to the Gulf.

The Extract does not refer to any case of JPlague occurring before the year 1904* At Bahrein a case of plague occurred in the harbour on Yt,C6TcL*'A' the *Java* in 1902,but the first case referred in Bahrein itself was on 26th April 1903,and there was evidence to show that the infection was imported from India. 3. As regards the alleged importation in 1910 of plague from Bahrein into Bushire in some old bedding, this aeems to be a mere assertion. Fo case of plague is known to have | occurred in Bahrein in 1910* Even had there been any cases it is highly unlikely that the infection would have been carried on in old bedding, ft*** if it is permissible to argue ten the experience of the Advisory Committee JrsgT Plague Investigation in India, vide their Interim Report dated 24th May 1910, where it is stated that The excreta of plague-infected patients may contain Plague * bacilli,hut the bedding,etc., of Plague kaaiiiA patient * soiled with excreta containing Plague bacilli was not found** found to be Infect It© to highly susceptible animals caused ** to live in and upon the bedding ' fhe old bedding might of course have conceivably contain* n. ed fleas, but the^ we merely come back on the fact that there was no infection in Bahrein at the time, 4, As regards Secondary Plague Centres,Assistant Surgeon, Monani, states:- * I have no knowledge of the existence of such during H the 4i years that X have been here and as far as I am aware * we have not heard of any outbreak of Plague at gatif,Oqjfiair »*or other important places on the Arab coast and the idea of 'their acting as centres of dissemination of Plague is far -fetched and vague and not supported by facts.- 5. The idea that the Pearl Fisheries are par excellence the disseminators of Plague cannot be accepted on mere assertion* Firstly I question whether there is any consider- -able emigration of divers from Bahrein to other pearling centres* There is certainly a large immigration of divers from all quarters into Bahrein* In any case there is absolutely nothing to support the assertion that plague infection is Imported into Bahrein * By visitors from the Arabian Mainland, least of all from the interior where as far as is known plague does notr exist* 6* If Br. Faivre and the 'many writers' who support his theory were to visit the south Coast of the Gulf,they might or might not be confirmed in their theory,but they would certainly add to their knowledge of Arabian Geography* liiadh is in Hejd some 250 miles from the coast from which it is separated by the Bahna desert,and 300 miles from Bahrein by the route followed via hofu^ and O^air. It cannot be regarded as a town of Persian Gulf Literal nor as an adjacent neighbour of Bahrein* 7* I am personally inclined to doubt whether it wouldbe possible to prove tkat the reGurrenoe of plague in Bahrein on each occasion every second year is duer/to fresh infection imported from abroad# j.t seems no ^ improbable that the infection now exists permanently in Bahrein*usually in © dormant form* but becom- | ing active whenever climatic conditions ©re favourable# In tnis case I suppose it would come under the designation of a Secondary Blague Centre# I have* etc*, (Sd*) B#L#B# Iiorimer* Captain* Political Agent* BABBS I ST#[Thia Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government,] transmit herein a report by Dr. Neligan on the meeting of the Sanitary Council held on the 3rd July.

Plague in the Gulf. —The epidemic at Bushire has come to an end. There have been 118 cases, with 98 deaths. At Bahrein the epidemic is decreasing. There have been about 2,000 deaths there. The telegram from the chief medical officer in the Gulf, which takes exception to the note read by Dr. Eeistmantel at the ninetieth meeting on recent epidemics of plague there, I deferred reading until the next meeting, as Dr. Eeistmantel was not Quarantine Establishment at Enzeli. —At the last meeting of the council the representative of the Ministry of the Interior announced that the Government was unable to give up the ground asked for by the council for the proposed quarantine station.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, Simla. r f- The proceedings of the 90th Seance of the Tehran Sanitary Council, dated 1st May, being of special interest, I have the honour to address the following observations to the Government of India in connection therewith. 2. (Paragraph 3 {a) of the Proceedings)* One of the delegates drew attention to the fact that the outbreaks of plague in the Gulf Ports during the last few years have always occurred in the spring, and suggests for the origin of them an explanation purporting to be his own, but really only the resuscitation of a theory advanced by Dr. Bussiere in 1904. I shall return to this later. As a layman I have always connected the outbreaks with the annual arrival at this season, from Bombay and Calcutta, of the special steamers which bring large cargoes of rice to the Gulf Ports, the presumption being, in my mind, that plague-infected rats find their way ashore with the rice bags. It is true that outbreaks have occurred with such chronological regularity of late years that one cannot but suspect that the disease must have become endemic in some of the Gulf Ports, but that is a question which I must leave to responsible and expert professional opinion. What I am primarily concerned to communicate to Government now is the suspicions generated in my mind by a consideration of the identity of the delegate above referred to and of the possi ble motive of his present revival of Dr. Bussiere’s fanciful theory as to the pro bable origin of plague in the Gulf. The functionary in question, Dr. Feistmantel, is Austro-Hungarian and Turkish representative on the Sanitary Council, and from the first has been pointedly hostile to the Gulf Quarantine Service under British management, vide, for example, Legation Despatch No 14 Commercial, dated 16th May 1910, to Received with Foreign Department endorse- HlS Majesty^ Foreign Office. This fact ment No. mqi-e.a., dated j 4 th July 1910. makes it difficult to disassociate from his proceedings the suspicion that they emanate from an ulterior motive connected with Turco-German policy. 3. In connection with the proceedings of Dr. Bussiere ; the use made of him by the German Consul at Bushire ; and the attitude of the Austro-Hungarian Delegate on the Sanitary Council, I would invite reference to the papers mar- • Charge d'Alfaires, Teh,an, t. Fordgn Offic, fj nal 'y C .' t / ed * The views expressed by No. 1 6-Commerciai, dated 4th May 190S, for- L)r.

Dr. Bussiere himself is suffi- t Foreign Department endorsement No. 43 -E.B., ciently sketchy in his geography when he dated 8 th January 1907- S p ea ks of “ Le Nejd (El Riad) SUr la COte Arab d’El Hasa, au voisinage de Bahrein,” but Dr. Feistmantel goes further and exaggerates the convenient inaccuracy by leaving out all mention of El Hasa. Both doctors ignore the fact that the country between Nejd and the coast, nearly 300 miles distant, is practically desert and the tribes nomadic. Dr. Faivre himself when referring to the question of communication between the interior and the coast, on the Arab side, wrote— “ Toutes ces routes presentent au point devue de la dissemination de cholera et de la peste un interSt en rapport avec leur importance : la plupart ne traversent au voisinage du Golfe, surtout sur la cote Arabique, que des regions desertes peu favourables &amp; la propagation des epidemics. La grande voie fluviale du Chatel Arabe reste la plus dangereuse et c’est elle qu’il importe surtout de surveiller et de proteger.” l lc2 Dr. Theodore Thomson also, in his later report* of July 1906, referring to the Arabian side of the Gulf below Kuwait wrote— •Foreign Department endorsement No. 4I49*E.B., dated 23rd October 1906. “The extension thence of cholera or plague by land is not to be seriously apprehended, because of the tracts of desert that lie along and beyond the shores of the Gulfs of Oman and Persia, on the Arabian side, in consequence of which there is little or no communication by land with countries from which these diseases might conceivably spread in the direction of Europe.” 4. When Dr. Bussidre wrote the report in question he had only recently arrived in the Gulf and could have no first hand knowledge of conditions ruling there in respect of such subjects as the pearl fisheries, and his remarks in the latter regard appear to me to be altogether inaccurate. Firstly, the sorting and packing of pearl shells certainly does not take place in the spring, t.e. before the pearling season begins. It is during the pearling season, say June to October, that the boats coming in from the pearl banks for supplies bring with them their last batch of shells and sell them ashore, and any sorting or packing goes on then until just after the pearling season. Again, Lingah has quite enough to do with her connection with the pearl banks on the Persian side, and it is by Persian and not Arab dhows that she is frequented. The latter use their own ports of origin on the Arab Coast for their supplies. Again I would emphasize the fact that in 1904, when Dr. Bussiere wrote this report, he was being specifically used by the Russian Consulate-General and Monsieur Naus, to assist in the task of ousting us from the control of Persian Gulf Quarantine, and his report must be regarded as coloured by the policy for the furtherance of which he had been brought to Bushire. Dr. Feistmantel is apparently animated by similar sentiments of hostility to our regime, and it is not surprising that he should have bethought himself of Dr. Bussiere’s theory to further his aims. 5. As Dr. Thomson’s report had apparently acted as an antidote to Dr. Faivre’s, Dr. Bussiere’s note was not taken very seriously at the time, but it seems possible that Dr. Feistmantel may contrive to get his views aired at the Paris Conference; it may therefore be well to have full rebutting information ready to hand and I am taking steps to get it. 6. From the political point of view, it is easy to understand how convenient and welcome to the Sublime Porte would be the existence of an accepted theory that Central Arabia and the hinterland of the Arab Coast were foyers of plague and that the pearl diving fraternity formed the medium for the spread of infec tion in the Gulf. _ Such a theory would furnish Turkey with means of consolida ting her position in Nejd and strengthening her shaky footing at points on the Coast or in the hinterland, through the instrumentality of quarantine measures dictated by the Board of Health at Constantinople, and necessarily having the countenance of the European Powers. She might even succeed in directing international attention to the question of the rights of control and jurisdiction over the floating population on the pearl banks during times of epidemic. My apprehensions may perhaps be considered at present to have no very lively foundation, but I submit that Dr. Feistmantel’s remarks at least point to the expediency of our maintaining a vigilant look out for any further signs of a harbinger ^ 1 6 P ° ICy ° f Which his revivaI of this theor y be a r-nrh e1 '^ su SS es ted explanation would appear to be purely th Jp C - Ura * hP f 18 n °i thG sll S htest reason ^ suppose, as far as I know, that admhted bY P ^ m and &gt; as D ^s.

The friendly tYibute of Dr. Georges, the retiring President, to the Gulf Sanitary Service generally and to the Residency Surgeon, Captain McConaghy, personally, is satisfactory, as is also the fact that in Dr. Georges, as the repre- V sentative of Persia at the Sanitary Conference in Paris, we shall have a function ary who has shown himself personally and officially friendly to our Quarantine regime. I attach a copy of a telegram sent by the Residency Surgeon to the Sanitary Council in connection with the subject of this letter, and repeated by me to His Majesty’s Minister to whom I am also sending a copy of this com munication. Telegram No. 163, dated 17th June 1911. From—The Chief Quarantine Medical Officer in the Persian Gulf, To—The President, Sanitary Council, Tehran. I beg to point out that note read by Dr. Feistmantel given on page 26 of 90th Seance is, as regards the epidemic at Lingah in 1904, merely an inaccurate quotation of a note by Dr. Bussiere forming last Annex, to Dr. Faivre’s report of 1906. The details given are misleading and exaggerated and have no authority as compared to the official reports furnished by the Chief Quarantine Officer which showed that during period of epidemic, 27th April to 3rd August, 286 deaths occurred from all febrile disease including plague of which 56 cases were admitted to be plague. As regards outbreak of 1910, please note that assertion regarding importa tion from old bedding is unfounded, and that I definitely stated in my report of August 22nd to President that there was not the slightest ground for the suspi cion that the infection had been brought from Bahrain. I respectfully protest at inaccurate information from extraneous and irresponsible sources being resorted to while authoritative official reports of Chief Quarantine Officer to President are studiously ignored.

Copies of the proces-verbal of the 90th meeting are also enclosed.^' I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. I HAVE the honour to report that a meeting of the Sanitary Council was held yesterday, the 5th June, at which I took the chair. The public vaccination service continues to meet with success, and some IT.000 people have been vaccinated since the end of Eebruary. Unfortunately, the monthly sum assigned to the service by the Government is paid very irregularly, and nothing has been received for the provinces. Plague in the Gulf .—At Bushire the epidemic is decreasing. So far, eighty-one cases have occurred, with seventy deaths. At Bahrein, over 200 cases had occurred up to the 14th May. There is also an epidemic at Debai, and several cases have been caught in the quarantine station at Lingah among the passengers for the Arabian ports. Cholera in Russia .—Two cases occurred in the province of Kherson (Odessa) at the end of April. No new cases have been notified since. Quarantine Station at Enzeli .—The events which led up to the proposal for this quarantine station may be shortly traced:— 1. Eor several years Persia has been threatened or infected with cholera from Russia. Quarantine has been enforced against Russian shipping on the Caspian. The principal station has been at Astara—insanitary and uncomfortable to a degree. Europeans have been bitter in their protests against it. 2. The Sanitary Council has frequently demanded better accommodation, and since direct boats began between Baku and Enzeli chose the latter port as the place for the principal quarantine station. 3. At the end of 1910 the Medjliss voted 20,000 tomans for a quarantine service in the Caspian. 4. In March a commission of the Sanitary Council was sent to Enzeli and Astara to choose sites and draw up plans. At Enzeli the only suitable place found was a garden belonging to the Government containing a dilapidated tower which would cost 10,000 tomans to repair, and the materials of which would go a long way towards making the proposed quarantine buildings. 5. The council unanimously adopted the proposals of the commission, and on the 15th April they were submitted to the Persian Government. 6. After a delay of seven weeks the Persian Government replied that the garden was required for official receptions, that the tower would be repaired, and that another site would be brought for the quarantine station.

[2109 c—l]9 The council discussed this reply at the meeting, and came to the following conclusions:— 1. It could not reconsider its decision for: (a) the site chosen was the only suitable one ; (b) the extra expense involved in buying a special piece of laud and repairing the tower was considerable (20,000 tomans). In the present state of country’s finances the council did not hope for a satisfactory solution to the questi/j in the way the Government proposed, and looked forward to further prolonged delay. 2. The quarantine station could he used for receptions if necessary, and, indeed, it would be more suitable for the purpose than the present dilapidated garden and tower. If it was objected that it could not be so used when occupied by passengers in quarantine, it might equally well he said that in time of cholera receptions would not he held. 3. The delegates of the different Powers represented at the meeting having declared that their respective Governments would no longer agree to their subjects in the first and second classes being put into quarantine unless suitable accommodation was provided for them, the council decided that in the event of quarantine having to he enforced against llussia this summer, only 3rd class passengers (from whom the greatest danger of the spread of infection is always to he apprehended) would be required to undergo quarantine. Passengers of the 1st and 2nd classes would have to submit to a medical visit only. 4. As it is now too late to hope for the construction of the quarantine stations proposed, the council advised the immediate erection of temporary accommodation for 3rd class passengers at Astara and Enzeli. It also proposed to limit the duration of quarantine to three days instead of five, as being in accordance with the most lateiy acquired knowledge of the incubation period of cholera. The council’s views have been conveyed to the Persian Government, with a request for an early reply. I have, &amp;c. A. R NELIGAN. P.S. June 12.—The Persian Government has since changed its opinion, and has made the garden of the Shamsul Imaret over to the Sanitary Council for the proposed quarantine establishment at Enzeli. The Government has also agreed to the proposed station at Astara. Instructions have therefore been issued to begin the buildings at once; construction and the necessary expenditure will he supervised by the local directors of customs. A. E.

Russia has also been declared indemne . The expenses of Quarantine, etc. during the recent epidemic amounted to Frans 150,000 in round figures say £3,000. The proposed Quarantine service for the Caspian . The Representative of the Ministry of the Interior handed a draft on the Customs for Tomans 10,000 to the President with a . letter stating that it was an instalment of the Tomans 20,000 voted by the Medjliss for the establishment of quarantine stations in the Caspian, and that the balance would be paid when required. This marks a very important event in the histroy of the Council - a large sum has for the first time been Barclay, , h.c., h,c.been put at its disposal by the Government. As will be seen later on in this memorandum - a iurther sum has been handed to the Council for the establishment ot a public vaccination service. Later no doubt the proceeds of the tax on uead bodies at Kasri Shirin will be added. The Council will have for this time therefore a budget - but for the present the sums at its disposal are earmarked for special purposes. Its importance and its powers are for this moment considerably increased. The vote of thanks to the Medjliss for these evidences of its 'enlightened co-operation' was passed. The President then asked that a Commission should be appointed for one year to deal with the question of the Caspian. The President and Secretary were elected ex-officio, and to them were added Drs. Feismantel and Dobroknotow and Saif ul Attiba, a native hakim, representative of the Ministry of the Interior. The President said he would start shortly for Enzeli to draw up plans on the spot for the proposed chief quarantine station. He asked if any members would care to go with him, and Drs. Feismantel and Heydas Mirza - a native hakim and deputy - offered to do so. -TV. TheThe Gulf . Captain McConaghey’s telegram asking for compensation for the owner of the boat daring quarantine work which was damaged in the storm at Lingah, and for the two men who were injured was read. The Council decided to recommend to the Minister of the Interior that the compensa tion (Tomans 125) be granted. Installation of the Public Vaccination Service for Tehran. The report of the Commission on this question was re-read, and it was decided to start public vaccination in the way therein recommended as soon as the lymph could be obtained from Europe. Five Stations were allowed for by the Commission - and there was some discussion as to these - but it was eventually decided to try the proposed arrangement for a month. The necessary funds will be supplied by a charge of 10% on the tax on animals and vehicles in Tehran. The instalment for the month of January has been received by the President. I may be allowed to express a little personal satisfaction at the adoption of the idea of public vaccination, for, after seeing more than one effort to start an institute for the making ol lymph fail, I got some of the native doctors totake up the idea of byying vaccine in large quantities in Europe. The foundation of the Commission ol the Sanitary Council mentioned above was the result. It is now to be hoped that the scheme will meet with success - for there is no worse scourge in Persia than small pox. It is hoped to extend public vaccination to other towns gradually. The army authorities propose to make vaccination compulsory and have ordered enough lymph for 2,000 men. Dr. Amadeo read a long criticism of the quarantine arrangements during the recent epidemic of cholera - which included a well deserved eulogy of Dr. G-eorges. He proposed the foundation of stations at Kasri Shirin Julfa, Astara, Bander G-ez and Meshdissar, and added that the Board at Constan tinople was much interested in the efforts which had and were being made by Persia in the direction of the control of epidemics.

I HAVE the honour herewith to submit to you, for transmission to the Foreign Office, copies of the proces-verbal of the 84th meeting of the Sanitary Council held on the 7th November. Since the meeting cholera has appeared at Kerman; the epidemic continues at Mohammerah, and at Resht has broken out afresh. All quarantine measures have been cancelled except in the Persian Gulf, where (at Mohammerah) the Persian Government has applied for the assistance of the hospital assistant at His Majesty’s consulate at Ahwaz in preventing the spread of cholera into the interior. Under the heading 3, section B, in the proces-verbal the establishment of quarantine stations on the Caspian refers to Enzeli in particular. It is proposed to make this port the chief quarantine post, instead of Astara as hitherto—this in view of the establishment of a direct passenger service between Enzeli and Baku. A credit of 10,000 tomans was voted by the Medjliss early in the year for the creation of a quarantine service on the Caspian. At the meeting in question the representative of the Minister of the Interior professed entire ignorance of the matter. The creation of the proposed quarantine station is desirable if only from the point of view of economy and of the travellers on the Casjuan who may be unfortunate enough to he put into quarantine.

BARCLAY. of the Persian Sanitary Council to the Foreign Office., it appears to me useful to give a resumd of the present state of the epidemic of cholera in the country and the existing quarantine arrangements. Tehran .—It is fortunate to be able to report that no case of cholera has occurred in the city or its environs. Kermanshah .—The epidemic has been much more severe in this town and its environs than in any other part of Persia; 461 deaths are known to have taken place in the town, but undoubtedly many have been concealed. The epidemic is now rapidly declining. The last report gives only five deaths a-day. I think it is only right that the attention of the Government of India should be drawn to the excellent way in which the Indian hospital assistant has worked during the epidemic. As is plain from the reports of His Majesty’s acting consul, in a country where epidemics of cholera are of periodical occurrence, it would appear most regrettable that the removal of all medical assistance from His Majesty’s consulate at Kermanshah should have to he considered. Hamadan. —Forty-seven cases with twenty deaths have occurred. No cases since the 19th October. EnzeJi and the other Ports on the Caspian Sea .—No cases since the 16th October. Azerbaijan .—A few cases have occurred at Ahar and Baklon. Ardebil, Sirab, Zenjan, and other infected centres are free from cholera. Khorassan .— Meshed .—Two hundred and fifteen cases with 73 deaths have occurred between the 13th September and the 19th October. Both in the city and the surrounding villages the epidemic is rapidly dying out. Resht .—Eight cases with seven deaths have occurred. There have been no cases for several days. The Persian Gulf .—Cholera appeared at Muscat on the 21st September, died out, but reappeared on the 19th October, and still exists there. Bussorah .—Cholera appeared on the 23rd September.

The native doctor, who was sent to form a quarantine station at Sardaneh on the Meshed road, returned a few days later.

It was decided to leave things as they are for the present; and to convene a special meeting if stronger reasons for removing the Quarantine arose. The outlook from the point of view of Tehran is therefore on the whole a little better than a fortnight ago, although the fact that Resht and Enzeli are infected constitutes a serious menace for the city. The favourable points are these 1. The weather is cooler, and every day gained means a shorter and less severe epidemic. 2. The epidemic in Russia is diminishing. 3.

The epidemic in Russia is considerably more severe this year than last year. it has reached Tiflis, Baku and Ashkabad, so that the whole of the North of Persia is threatened. It has indeed crossed the frontier and reached Ardebil where 7 deaths took place on July 29th, and on the 5th two Russian soldiers died of the disease. On July 21st a death took place at Astara (Persia) but it was an imported case. Precautions taken by the Persian Government . The President had his usual complaint to make about the slowness and ineptitude of the Government Departments; he especially accused the Ministry of Finance for loss of time in carrying out the necessary arrangements.

It was also decided to ask the Persian Government to refuse the visa on the Turkestan frontier to people wishing to enter Persia. (Can this be done?) At the close of the meeting. Dr. Georges said the work was so exacting that he could not go on unless he was given a clerk and that he had applied for one.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a memorandum upon the proceedings of the Sanitary Council in their meeting on the 6th June last, that has been submitted to me by Dr. Neligan, physician to His Majesty’s Legation. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Dr. Neligan to Mr. Marling. Sir, Gulahek, June 29, 1910. I HAVE the honour to submit to you a memorandum on sanitary matters. A meeting of the Sanitary Council was held on the 6th June; copies of the proces-verbal are attached. Plague at Bushire .—The epidemic continues to decrease. The Persian authorities are doing what they can to assist the quarantine service, and have given 700 tomans for a lazaret between the town and the mainland. Cholera at Lenkoran .—The epidemic appears to have died out. No quarantine measures were taken by the Persian Government, since the cases were scattered and did not occur in the village itself. In this connection it is interesting to note (vide the proces-verbal) that there is no mate'riel at any of the Persian ports on the Caspian necessary for a quarantine station. The promises made by the Persian Government in the winter to equip three posts have not been fulfilled, and, indeed, few expected that they would be. On p. 30 of the proces-verbal, “ Correspondance generate,” &amp;c., “ Interieur— Decision de principe,” will be found a ruling of the Persian Government of no little interest. The council is in future to communicate entirely with the Minister for the Interior, and not, as heretofore, sometimes with him and sometimes with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Thus the local and national character of the council is very clearly emphasised. The importance of this has been referred to in my memorandum on the Sanitary Council. No reply has yet been received to the council’s question about plural voting. As it was addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and as the council has been instructed to deal with the Minister for the Interior only, it is more than probable that the question will be lost between the two departments, and will remain unanswered. German Activity. —Dr. Feistmantel, the vice-president and Austrian delegate, came to me the other day, as I have already informed you, with a complete scheme for taxing shipping in the Gulf and corpses on their way to the Turkish sacred cities. He wished to know what our views would be with regard to the former, as the great bulk of the shipping was ours. The proceeds of the tax (a tonnage and nominal one) were to form the nucleus of a budget to be administered by the Sanitary Council. I showed him the obvious objections from the British and practical points of view, and suggested that it was not his business to make any such proposal. He agreed not to bring it forward at the present time, but I am not sure that it will not be raised again, perhaps not in so direct a manner, in reference to the known bad condition of the lazarets in the gulf. The question for His Majesty’s Government then to decide will be whether British shipping is to be taxed for the erection of lazarets in Persia, on a coast which has no facilities in the way of harbours, &amp;c. It would seem that expenditure on lazarets is capital expenditure and a matter for the Persian Govern ment. Of course, the present state of the country’s finances would not permit of it. I know for a fact that Dr. Eeistmantel has been in communication with the German [2869 &amp;—]] ........ COPY TO INDIA | 1 914?.. EEOEFTARY’S NT.^.bL..2 Legation about this proposal and had elaborated it with the help of the Ottoman delegate. As to the tax on corpses, this has been referred to in previous despatches in this series. The tax exists, but is pocketed by a local hakim (doctor). The Cabinet ha''' agreed to the tax, but at a lower rate (7 krans). The whole is to be collected by the Customs and administered by the council. If a properly equipped lazaret is built with the money at Kasri Shirin, it will undoubtedly be of advantage to Persia in preventing the introduction of epidemics, but cannot do all that is said of it. Dr. Eeistmantel brought himself again before the public by producing a set of rules for use in time of cholera; and himself and Dr. Schliebs (of the Persian hospital) by offering to compile a paper on the tropical diseases of Persia at the International Conference on Public Health at . Dresden, to be held in 1911. Dr. Schliebs, at the proposal of his Minister, has offered to represent Persia gratuitously, as he will be in Germany on leave. Now, Dr. Feistmantel has never seen a case of cholera, and has practically no practice, and Dr. Schliebs has been in Persia nine months ! They both, however, have irons in the fire at Vienna and Berlin respectively, and no doubt their energy must be put down to a natural desire to impress their chiefs, as well as any Persians who may read the proces-verbal of the meeting. Extract from Proces-verbal of 78th Meeting of Persian Sanitary Council, held June 6, 1910. 5. Caisse autonome du Conseil. Taxes sur les Cadavres {nouveau Projet). LE vice-president remet au conseil un nouveau projet de taxes sur les cadavres transitant en Perse pour etre inhumes en Turquie dans les lieux saints chiites. Ce pro jet vise, en attendant mieux, a trouver les ressources pour 6tablir au moins sur la route Kirmanchah—Kerbellah, qui s’est affirm4e une voie si active de propagation de la peste et du cholera, un 6tablissement convenable d’observation et d’isolement reclamd depuis les conferences internationales de Paris et de Venise. Son economie consiste a grever d’une taxe nouvelle supplementaire de 13 krans les cadavres transitant de Perse en Turquie. Cette taxe rapporterait annuellement une somme de 3,000 a 5,000 tomans, qui, geree par le conseil, serait affectee exclusivement a 1 etablissement et a Pentretien de I’etablissement susmentionne. Le conseil decide que ce nouveau projet, qui remplace ceux precedemment etablis a diverses reprises, sera transmis au Ministere de ITnterieur, un double restant depose aux archives du conseil.

[12160] No. 1. [April 11.] Section 2. Sir A. Hardinge to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 11.) (No. 21. Commercial.) Sir, Brussels, April 9, 1910. I HAVill the honour to observe in continuation of my telegram No. 8, Commercial, of to-day’s date, that the fact of my having, on receipt of your despatch '\ T' ^ ^ /-v 1 -l-l'vr-v -i- T-* 1 ^ - - 1 • ill • ii \ 1 No. 21, Commercial, of the 25th ultimo, conveyed as directed by you in a note to M M. Davignon, the thanks of His Majesty’s Government to that of Belgium, for its action in requesting that the British delegate on the Persian Sanitary Board should act provisionally as representative of Belgian interests, would make it somewhat difficult for us now to adopt without risk of offending the Belgians the line suggested in your telegram No. 3*of yesterday. To tell them that our only object is to establish the principle of our acting as their representative when we find it needful would look rather like using them and their interests as mere instruments of our own, whilst to add that there was “ no immediate necessity’’ for putting the right that they have given us into practice, would be hardly consistent with the hope which you instructed me on the 9 th ultimo to express that the matter “ would receive early consideration,” and which led me to settle it promptly. I do not know what is the present character of the Persian Sanitary Board, which I can only remember as a very feeble infant, or whether it attempts to interfere with our quarantine officers in the Gulf ports, but it seems to me clear that if Germany, which has no interests in Persia, except that of creating fictitious claims for ulterior political objects, sets to work to meddle in Persian affairs, we who have real and vital interests there are not following her example, but merely acting in self-defence, in employing similar methods for our own protection, and, indeed, that in dealing with Germany the best policy is that of tit for tat. If, however, there are reasons—and from Sir George Barclay’s view of the ease good ones doubtless exist— for deferring for the present the general transfer to our delegate of the representation of Belgian interests on the Board, I would suggest that he should explain them privately to his Belgian colleague, and that the latter should defer making the application to the Persian Government, or (should be have already made it) find some pretext for provisionally withdrawing or qualifying it. The matter could I should imagine be arranged locally more easily than here, without embarrassing explanations between the two Governments. I observe in the press that the Germans are employing a certain “ Seyyid ” Ruete to push their so-called economical and commercial interests in Persia, perhaps with the idea of his gaining influence by representing himself as a “ Seyyid ” in the Persian sense of the term. I am not sure whether His Majesty’s legation at Tehran is aware of this agent’s real history ; he is the son of a German clerk employed in the early eighties in a house of business at Zanzibar, who made love to, and by bribing eunuchs and other slaves, ran away with a daughter of Sultan Barghash-bin-Said, contracted a Christian marriage with her in Germany, and brought up his children by her as Christians and German subjects. Some years later Prince Bismarck made a characteristic attempt to use this scandal in the Royal House of Zanzibar, in order to wring political concessions from the Sultan, and knowing how cruelly her presence at Zanzibar would pain her father and humiliate him in the eye of the Arabs, to whom when she eloped he had notified her death, he sent her out there on a German flagship with instructions to the German consul-general to support certain claims to lands, &amp;c., which she now advanced in her new character as a German subject. The attempt was baffled by the quiet dignity of Seyyid Barghash, who merely replied that the claimant was no daughter of his; the Princess whose name she professed to hear had long been dead, and he begged the German representative not to outrage her memory by suggesting that she could have ever prostituted herself to a low class Christian. I need scarcely add that in the eyes of every Mahommedan acquainted with the facts, “ Seyyid ” Ruete would be deemed a bastard, and even if he were [2784 1—2] ] i J i I -&lt; 1 Hi dlegitimate and a Moslem would have no claim to the title of Seyyid. This title as used by the Arab rulers, formerly Imams, of Muscat and Zanzibar, is, moreover, simply employed by them in its literal sense of &lt;£ Lord,” and has not the connection which it implies in Persia with the family of Mohammed. The matter is of course not of much importance, and I only mention it in case it should have escape# attention as another indirect illustration of the German methods with which our representatives in Persia have to deal. I shall await your further instructions before making any fresh communication to the Belgian Government respecting the Persian Sanitary Board. T &gt;10 V A ATY'* ARTHUR H.

Johnstone to Sir Udivard Grey.—(Received March 21.) (No. 19. Commercial. Confidential.) Sir ’ vr at. • ^ , / Copenhagen, March 17, 1910. OJN the receipt of your telegram No. 2, Commercial, of the 9th instant, I endeavoured to discover in the archi\es any documents which could inform me how the Persian Sanitary Board was constituted, but I was unable to do so. .1 ™ et tbe Minister for Foreign Affairs in the evening at the Palace, and enquired of his Excellency if he knew anything about the board, and as he stated he was quite in the dark about it and had never even heard of it, I enquired of Dr. Hagerup, the Norwegian Minister, who, as you are aware, is an eminent international jurist, if he knew anything about it. Dr. Hagerup promised to look at his very complete library, and on the morning of the 10th I received a private letter from him, stating that the board was apparently constituted according to the provisions of the Convention of Paris of the 3rd April, 1894. I looked at the convention, but was puzzled by the fact that His Majesty’s Government had apparently not adhered to Annex III, and that in 1897 His Majesty’s ships of war and merchant marine had been exempted from the quarantine measures enacted by that annex. I took the book containing the convention to the Foreign Office, and informed the Under-Secretary that I presumed the Persian Sanitary Board was constituted under the convention of 1894. He told me in reply that, as I was aware, Danish interests at Constantinople were entrusted to the Swedish Minister, and that he would be obliged by my embodying in an official note my request that Denmark would allow herself to be represented on the Persian Sanitary Board by the British delegate on the board. In the circumstances, I thought it best not to state that Sweden had already given her vote to a delegate representing another foreign Power, and I addressed a note to the Danish Government, copy of which I have the honour to enclose, merely asking for the Danish vote on the board without entering into any details. I telegraphed to you the substance of the above the same afternoon. On receiving your telegram No/3, stating that your first telegram referred to the Persian Sanitary Council sitting at Tehran, I at once called at the Ministry and explained matters to Herr Scavenins. His Excellency told me that he had searched carefully through all his latest archives relating to Persia and sanitation, but had been unable to discover any documents empowering his Government to nominate a delegate to the board, and would like to know their exact position. This I telegraphed to you also, and was informed that I should receive a copy of the “ reglement ” governing the constitution of the board from His Majesty’s Minister at Stockholm. The “ rhglement ” reached me this morhing, and I took it to the Foreign Office, but was unable to see M. Scavenius, who was very busy. The Under-Secretary, however, took the “ rhglement ” and told me he would consult the Minister as soon as possible. I urged him to allow us to have the Danish vote, and I then told him that both Sweden and Norway had given their vote to foreign delegates. He said that Denmark had the right by treaty of being represented in Persia, but had not even a consul there, though there was a Persian consul in Copenhagen. Both Norway and Sweden had consuls representing them in Tehran, and these gentlemen might possibly have been charged by their two Governments to represent them on the board.

Herr Krag said that never having been hitherto represented in Persia, he did not know if they could suddenly give us the right to vote for them without first asking the Persian Government, and I replied that then I should have thought it quite simple to allow His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to enquire if the Persian Govern ment objected to Denmark being represented on the council, and, in case of no objection being raised, for Denmark to allow our delegate to assume the Danish vote.Herr Krag said he would represent the matter to the Minister, and let me know his Excellency’s decision as soon as possible. t I am writing this to catch the messenger, who leaves early to-morrow, but I will telegraph the Danish answer directly I receive it. a ° 1 I have, &amp;c. * ALAN JOHNSTONE.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a report by the British delegate on the Persian Sanitary Council on the question of plural voting by the foreign members of that body, and on other points of a more general character concerning the status and powers of the council. Dr. INeligan, with whom I have discussed these matters at length, has exposed the situation so lucidly and fully that I need do no more than express my concurrence in his views, and more especially in his opinion that the most effective way of meeting the increase of German influence that we have to anticipate in Tehran would be by founding and maintaining some English educational establishment. The Russian Minister also generally concurs in Dr. Neligan’s conclusions. I venture to request that I may be informed of your instructions on the various points raised. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 1. Dr. Neligan to Mr. Marling. (No. 2. Confidential.) Tehran, May 15, 1910. I HAVE the honour to submit the following memorandum on the question of plural voting by members of the Persian Sanitary Council. ^ It will be remembered that at its 76th meeting the council decided itselr incompetent to deal with this question, and to refer it to the Persian Government^ The Minister for Eoreign Affairs gave his verdict in a letter which was receivec too late for the last (the 77th) meeting, and which Dr. Georges, the president, has shown privately to me. This reply is typically Persian, in that it is no reply at al &gt; it does not answer the council’s question. In addition it contains the following statements:— 1. The Persian Government is free to receive or to reject the council s decisions. (In other words—the sanitary council is an appendage of the Persian Government not an international board. This no one disputes.) 2. There is no necessity for the Powers to take part in its deliberations. 3. Votes are not transferable. These last two statements, if put before the council, would have raised a storm of opposition; they are, moreover, contrary to the spirit of the “ dastkhat ^ constituting the council (given in 1901), and to the rules of the council, sanctioned by the Persian Government itself (drawn up in September 1907). Dr. Georges, therefore, asked the Persian Eoreign Office privately to withdraw its letter. This was done, and at the same time Dr. Georges was invited to dratt what he considered the best reply to the council’s question. I have had several conversations with him on the subject. He is keenly alive to the interests of Great Britain anc o! Russia in Persia, and to our views about German aggressiveness. We are agreed t lat the best reply which the Persian Government can make to the sanitary council voum be in the following terms :— 1. The sanitary council is a national council; its duties are purely advisory. 2. The composition of the council is as follows :— (a.) Persian members—at present to the number of twenty-four. [2797/—1] \-(b.) The sanitary delegates of the foreign embassies and legations at Tehran, in accordance with the original “ dastkhat ” and with the rules. In addition, the doctor of the Indo-European telegraphs and the doctor of the Persian tramways, who were members before the rules were drawn up. An y increase in the number of members would lessen the efficiency of the council, and is therefore undesirable. 3. The mention, in article 2 (1) of the rules, of the two categories “ d61egu6s sanitaires des divers Stats,’’ and “ medecins des legations,” introduces an ambiguity. These two sentences should be replaced by the following : “ Le delegud sanitaire de chacun des Etats repr4sent6s diplomatiquement a Tdheran par une amhassade on une legation.” The delegates of other Powers to have the rights of “ membres assocffis ” only. (N.B.—The “ membres associes ” may discuss, but may not vote.) 4. As to plural voting—• Each Government represented at Tehran by an embassy or a legation shall have one vote. If a member, president included, is both a Persian official and the representative of a legation or an embassy at Tehran, he shall have as many votes as the Governments which he represents, in addition to his Persian vote. In case of absence, votes can he transferred in the sense of article 4 (1) of the r&amp;glement.” In case of equal division of votes, the president shall have a casting vote. As these recommendations, if accepted by the Persian Government, will fix the proceedings of the sanitary council within more definite limits than heretofore, it will he well to consider what effect they will have on the position of Great Britain in the sanitary council. This consideration practically resolves itself into the question: “ hat is likely to he the extent of German influence at Tehran in the future ? ” German influence, as far as the sanitary council is concerned, would appear to be certain to increase as time goes on. The Germans have a well-equipped school, and the Persian Government hospital. The Erench professors at the Persian medical school have, on the other hand, no hospital, although they have frequently been promised one. The Persian medical student will, therefore, in the future go to the German school, and from there to the Government hospital. The Erench professor’s contract ends in four years. It is highly probable that they will be replaced by Germans. Turning now to the present composition of the sanitary council, Persia can always command a majority on a vote, namely, in a full meeting (a very rare event), twenty-four votes to nine. The Persian members have, however, always followed the I rench lead up to the present; for Erench medicine has by far the largest following in Tehran. The English view of any question is certain therefore for four years at least to receive a majority of votes, namely, those of our three representatives : the Russian, American, Erench (and therefore the Persian) members. The strength of this combination has, however, been reduced lately by the departure of Dr. Coppin and M. Can6. Moreover, Drs. Scott and Cormick continue to sit in the council only because they were members before the “ r^glement ” was drawn up ; further, it is at the moment doubtful whether Dr. Lidley will remain in Persia, and whether the late Dr. Sadowsky will be replaced. Germany has two representatives, and can always count on the votes of the Austrian and Ottoman delegates. If and when, therefore, Germans replace the Erench members, and still further when they acquire their influence in the native medical profession, we shall be outnumbered in the sanitary council. It appears, however, unprofitable to pursue this question any further, or to try to calculate the distribution of votes in the future with any approach to exactness, for the following reasons :— 1. The sanitary council is purely an advisory body to the Persian Government. It has at present no budget, and no power to enforce its decisions. It can in no way be compared to the sanitary hoard at Constantinople. 2. Its decisions, as far as questions of quarantine go, are defined by the Convention of Paris, to which Persia is a signatory Power. 3. The political situation is unsettled.LU1UL HW-UIIJW»ytiflUi WBBSM ass ocies' 14 a feaslilt| e Kpreseiul ^Goverig folio!# te spit 111 * iVtMf The consideration of this question makes the facts clear, however:— 1. That German influence will continue to increase at Tehran. 2. That one of the chief means of checking it is by educational methods. a will not here enter into the question of how best this may be done, but I would submit that it is one worthy of the serious consideration of His Majesty’s and the Russian Governments, as well as of the Trench Government. Returning now to the proposals for settling the composition and voting methods of the council outlined above, which proposals will be put before the Persian Government for its approval, the following observations seem legitimate:— 1. It is desirable that the sanitary council should continue to be a Persian institution; attempts to give it an international character like that of the Constantinople board should be discouraged—this chiefly from the political point of view. Prom the international sanitary point of view, Persia really presents little interest. It is possible that plague and cholera might reach Europe via the Persian Gulf, especially if a railway is brought to its head. The quarantine service there, however, is in the best possible hands, and, moreover, the Convention of Paris defines quarantine procedure in black and white. 2. This paragraph simply confines the present composition of the sanitary council and the right of foreign Powers to take part in its deliberations. 3. The question of plural voting will be solved in a practical manner by limiting the vote to delegates of Powers, represented by an embassy or by a legation at Tehran; delegates of Powers not so represented may be nominated to the council, but may not vote. This will deprive Germany of the [Norwegian and Swedish votes, and will put an end to her attempts to increase her influence in the council by obtaining the representation of the smaller European Powers, with no interests at stake in the country. It is not improbable, however, that Germany will in the future seek for and obtain the representation of Italy (at present unrepresented), and of Holland (at present represented by a Erench member). The number of votes will, however, be known instead of unknown. Persian officials, who represent also an embassy or a legation, must of course be allowed to exercise their Persian vote. 4. Votes must be made transferable; if not, the absurd position would be created of a question of interest to some Power being settled in the absence of its delegate, without that Power being able to cast a vote in its own favour. Dr. George’s proposals would seem then to afford the most satisfactory solution of the question of plural voting and of the other points raised by the Persian Government. They will be submitted to the Persian Poreign Office. It will then remain to be seen whether the Persian Government will accept the whole or in part. In any case, its reply cannot reach the sanitary council before the meeting to be held on the 4th July. The discussion thereon will presumably take place at the succeeding meeting on the 1st August. In conclusion I would add that, though the functions of the sanitary council are purely advisory, its decisions are usually accepted by the Persian Government; that occasions might occur when its decisions might affect British interests, especially commercial, unfavourably; that the German legation never loses an opportunity, fair or unfair, of attacking in the council the quarantine administration in the Persian n i/ ^7 A 9 I £ 2L 3 C 3-7 — 3_ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.!

It will be seen that the Austro-Hungarian representative made an attack on the quarantine service in the Persian Gulf with reference to the present epidemic of plague. While it can scarcely he supposed that Hr.

Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Dr. Neligan to Mr. Marling. (No. 1.) Sir, Tehran, April 30, 1910. I HAVE the honour to report that a meeting of the sanitary council was held on the 30th April. Hr. Georges, the newly appointed president, took the chair for the first time. Hr. Coppin, the late president, who is leaving Persia on the expiry of his contract as court physician, was present. The following appointments were notified :— Representative of Belgium ... ... ... Myself. „ America (pro 7m.) ... ... Myself. „ Greece ... ... ... Hr. Georges. Dr. Eeistmantel read what may be considered as an attack on the quarantine service in the Gull in reference to the present epidemic of plague. He was amending it, with the aid of Hr. Amadeo, when I entered the room before the meeting. It came to this, that as the first case of plague had come ten days previously from Bahrein, and as there had been more than one epidemic of plague at Bahrein, the quarantine officer at Bushire had been lacking in his duty in not ordering a medical , visit and disinfection for people leaving Bahrein. Hr. Coppin pointed out to him that:— 1. There was no epidemic at present at Bahrein, and therefore it would be impossible and pointless to enforce such measures. 2. That Bahrein had nothing to do with Persia. Hr. Eeistmantel replied, “ Yes, hut it is under the English,” and suggested that as Captain McConaghey was new to his post he did not know of the importance of Bahrein. This also was not much to the point, for Hr. Eeistmantel knows that we have a resident and medical officer there, and that if any epidemic broke out, it would be at once reported to Bushire. The president said he would when next writing to Captain McConaghey point out the importance of Bahrein as a possible “ foyer ” of plague. Hid Hr. Eeistmantel think that he should telegraph however ? Dr. Eeistmantel replied “ No,” so he gave his case away. [2797 /—2] COPY TO INDIA \ V ij:- [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Maje sty’s Government.] EASTERN SANITARY REFORMS.

The council in the same way decided to refer the whole question to the Persian Government. So far pi have received no communication from the Persian Government on the subiect From what members said at the meeting, it is evident that those who have more than on™ vote will insist upon using them. With reference to your telegram No. 1, Commercial, proposing that the Belgian British ?

The Belgian Minister here has notified me that his Government would be glad ri our delegate would represent Belgian interests provisionally and for the time being. Ihe Danish Government is willing that a British doctor should represent its interests (Eoreign Office telegram No. 7, Commercial.) As, however, we do not require more votes^ on the council, but rather to prevent Germany from obtaining further representations (ride my despatch No. 7'in this series), I would suggest that no steps be taken.

Kalergis, who seemed relieved by my communication, readily gave the assurance asked for, and suggested that, in order that a record of it should remain in the archives of his office, I should ask him for it in a private letter to which he would reply in the same way. He at once drafted a telegram direct to the French Minister at Tehran requesting him to instruct the French delegate on the sanitary board to undertake the representation ol Greece upon that body, and begging to be informed by telegraph when this had been done. I propose, with your approval, to await the Minister’s communication to me of the accomplished fact of the b rench delegate having taken up the Greek representation before addressing to him the letter which he suggested. I take the liberty of pointing out that in thus offering, for our own purposes, to take upon ourselves the representation of Greece in one department, we are making it difficult to refuse to undertake in Persia that general protection of Greek interests (should France relinquish it) of which we are so anxious to be relieved in Turkey.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copies of the proces-verhal of the seventy- fourth meeting of the Sanitary Council, also two copies of the “ Reglement interieur ” of the council.* No question of importance came up for discussion at this meeting. At the seventy- fiftji meeting, however, held on the 7th March (the 'proces-verhal has not yet been published), I caused the question of plural voting to be raised by the president, Dr. Coppin. In view of the fact that the doctor of the German Legation, who also represents both Norway and Sweden, had cast only one vote in the recent elections of a vice-president of the council, I thought it advisable to be prepared for the future by getting the council to give a definite ruling on the subject of plural voting. No mention is made of it in the rules. Although it appears to me that every country represented on the council has a right to a vote, the question is not simply limited to multiple representation of foreign Governments by a single member. There are several members who come under two headings in article 2, paragraph I. Will they have also tw r o votes ? The question is altogether a complicated one, and, as a matter of fact—raised at the end of the meeting—it was discussed for a few moments only, and deferred to the next meeting, to be held on the 4th April. Two remarks made by the German representative are interesting. Mentioned as a member who represented two Powers, he emphatically pointed out that he represented three. Later he ^said he had no instructions on the subject, and was not prepared to discuss it. hor the moment, therefore, the matter is in abeyance. The manner in which this question of plural voting was presented by the president to the council can have left little doubt in the minds of some of the members that the question had been raised at my instigation, and it seemed to ine that this made it important for us to forestall any further efforts of Germany to obtain indirect represen tation of her interests on the council. There is a second member of the council of German nationality, who, as well as the Austrian delegate, might well be appointed to represent other Powers at the instance of Germany. + I therefore telegraphed to you, suggesting, in accordance with your telegram No. 1, Commercial, that the Governments of Belgium. Denmark, and Greece should be approached with a view to their promising, if they decided to appoint delegates, that no non-British delegate who was not a Belgian, Dane, or Greek respectively, should be chosen.

IMMEDIATELY on the receipt of yonr despatch No. SO^Commercial, of the 4th October last, respecting the appointment of the doctor to the German Legation in Tehran as the first Norwegian delegate to the Persian Sanitary Council, I approached Mr. Christophersen, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the subject, who stated that he was in complete ignorance of the whole affair, but would have it investigated as soon as possible. On my return from leave of absence in the early part of January, I again spoke to Mr. Christophersen, who stated that he still had not full information, and therefore could not give me a reply at the moment. Shortly after that, owing to the change of Government, Mr. Christophersen retired from office and was succeeded by Mr. Irgens, the late Minister in London. Mr. Irgens arrived here to take up his duties, and then went back to London, whence he returned here about ten days ago. I spoke to Mr. Irgens last month on the matter, and referred him to the note I had written his predecessor, and again to-day I asked him whether he had come to any decision on the subject. He replied that he had not had time to go fully into the question, but he promised me an answer by Saturday next, the 19th. Meanwhile, he said that he had heard from the Norwegian consul in Tehran (who appears to be a German), and he reported that Dr. Ilberg was going on a prolonged leave of absence, and Mr. Irgens thought that this might be made an excuse for the withdrawal of the candidature of any Norwegian delegate to the Persian Sanitary Council, so that in future this Government would be unrepresented. I shall, however, as soon as I receive Mr. Irgen’s official reply, have the honour to forward it to you, and beg to express my regret for the unfortunate delay which has arisen in obtaining an answer from the Norwegian Government, which I fear, from their anxiety not to offend German susceptibilities, will scarcely be as favourable as I should wish.

Barclay (No. 7, Commercial), March 24, 1910.[This Docoment is the Property of His Britannic Ma.iP sf.v'g Government.] Commercial, of the 19th ultimo, relative to the Tehran Sanitary Council, I have the honour to^ state that I have received, through the kindness of Mr. Bering, a copy of the “ Reglement interieur du Conseil sanitaire de TEmpire persan,” which I have, as instructed, transmitted to His Majesty’s Legation at Copenhagen. I venture to enclose a pro-memorm on certain points connected with this question. It does not appear that the Sanitary Council of Tehran enjoys the international mandate conferred on the Sanitary Council of Constantinople, and it certainly does not administer international funds. Unless there is a provision for the imposition of quarantine charges on foreign shipping, and for the administration of the funds so obtained by an international body sitting at Tehran, or again, unless the Persian Government expressly delegates its sovereign powers to a foreign committee sitting at Tehran, the functions of the Sanitary Council should be purely advisory. If not, the remedy must lie in representations to the Persian Government. I do not therefore propose to make further representations to the Swedish Government, as this would imply our acceptance of a doctrine which might prove inconvenient. If, however, the Swedish delegate (he., the German doctor) takes action contrary to the promise given me by Count Taube, I will call his attention to the fact, and enquire whether this was done by his sanction. I have informed my Russian colleague. SWEDEN has adhered to the Sanitary Convention of Venice and the sup plementary declaration. par le Gouvernement persan ” The Convention of Paris of 1903 contains provisions of a general nature as to measures of precaution, quarantine, &amp;c., and also as to the establishment of a station in the Persian Gulf “par les soins du Conseil superieur de Sante a Constantinople.” Difficulties have arisen with regard to this provision, which is in abeyance. There is no special provision as far as I can ascertain with regard to the “ Conseil sanitaire de Teheran,” nor are special powers conferred upon it by the convention. It is merely, it would appear, established to carry out the recommendations of the convention as far as they affect the world in general, and Persia in particular. One of the provisions of the Persian “ reglement ” (p. 10) states distinctly that ^ en aucun cas un membre titulaire ne pent reunir sur sa personne plus de deux voix.” There would seem therefore to be no ground for the fear that the German doctoi should be able to represent both Sweden and Norway as well as Germany. On the other hand, as there are several German doctors, it would seem that it would be possible for each to obtain the proxies of other Powers, which, according to the reglement, an ex officio right to appoint their delegates. It is for the council to decide whether such an arrangement can be sanctioned. If it is, Russia could obtain the representation of the Baltic States, &amp;c., and the council would be confronted with a rather absurd \V CO EASTERN SANITARY REFORMS. ^ [March 19.] CONFIDENTIAL.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 4, Commercial, of the 28th January, I have the honour to state that I attended Count Taube’s official reception to-day, and made a private and friendly communication, verbally, on the subject of the appointment of the doctor to the German Legation at Tehran to represent Sweden on the sanitary commttee which sat at that capital. I said that I knew that the great desire of his Government was to preserve both in deed and in spirit the strictest neutrality, and from this point of view I wished to give him a friendly warning. There were certain sanitary questions pending before the sanitary board of Tehran which were, as a matter of fact, of a highly controversial character—at least, they had been unfortunately presented in that form. These related to questions of quarantine. Russia owned the whole of the shipping on the Caspian, and England rather more than nine-tenths of the shipping navigating the Persian Gulf. It was natural that the Governments concerned attached a great deal of importance to the management of the quarantine relations. No doubt it was also natural that this question should arouse opposition in quarters where its political aspects were regarded as of importance. But this, ex hypothesi, was not the case with Sweden, who had neither commercial nor political interests in Persia. If, however, she gave full powers to the delegates of a Power, which was opposed to the action taken or contemplated by England or Russia, she would he taking a political part in a controversy in which she was not concerned, and would be regarded by the two Powers as having abandoned that policy of neutrality on which she so often insisted. These remarks I made in a friendly spirit, not in consequence of anything which had happened, but merely as a warning as to what might happen. Count Taube showed some surprise, and told me he had never heard either of the sanitary council at Tehran or of the appointment of a Swedish delegate, and that he quite understood and sympathised with the point of view which I had taken. I will report further, when I have heard what is the result of his enquiries in his department. I have, &amp;c. CECIL A. SPRING-RICE.

Sir I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of the proces-verbal of the 71st and 72nd meetings I of the Sanitary Council. At the 71st meeting, as will he seen from the proces-verbal, the mis-statement with regard to the expenses of the Gulf Sanitary Service, noticed in my last Despatch in this series, was corrected. I have still no communication from the Persian Government about this matter. At the same meeting. Dr. Ilberg, physician to the German Legation, was nominated as the Swedish Delegate. It would be interesting to know what are the Swedish interests which demand representation on the Sanitary Council. It will be remembered that Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart., ., &amp;c ., &amp;c .r Dr Ilberg was recsntly nominated as Norwegian Repre sentative, so that he now has three votes. Dr. Schliehs, his colleague, is also a member of the Council and Austria-Hungary has a delegate. Ger- »' i i many has therefore five votes hut unless German in n S 111: ;! &gt; : Hi v f ' 1 ml 1 f i. j fluence increases here very much, they are not like ly to affect the decisions of the Council. The French and Persian representatives always vote with ourselves. The 72nd meeting was held specially to consid er the report of a Commission elected to draw up a scheme for the Sanitary defence of Northern Persia, which is yearly threatened by the outbreaks of Chol era in Russia. The scheme is fully described in the proces-verbal. Nothing can be done until the Spring makes building possible, nor until the Persian Gov ernment supplies the necessary funds, half of which are said to have been 'promised'. The discussionmore sign ot the increasing spirit of Nationalism: the Persians present insisted strongly on the point that the members of the proposed quarantine service should be Persians. This is a very estimable sent!, ment, but although the type of Persian Doctor is im proving as far as technical knowledge goes, I am informed that there is hardly one in the country, capable of carrying out the duties of a quarantine officer. The idea of Russia taking entire charge / of a quarantine service on the Caspian Sea, just as Great Britain has done in the Gulf, has been broach ed from time to time in the Sanitary Council. Con ditions local and, political are however too uncertain to make it profitable to discuss the future more fully. It may, however, be added that, if the present scheme comes to anything, quarantine taxes are sure to he levied and the question of imposing them in the Gulf is sure to he raised. Should they be imposed, it would be an excellent thing for the country from the financial point of view, hut it wouldV| S •Wk i would give the Persian Government a handle to take part in the affairs connected with the Gulf, which it does not now possess, and would add to the labours of the quarantine officers.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copies of the proces-verbal of the sixty- eighth meeting of the Sanitary Council, together with Dr. Neligan’s report of the meeting, and his remarks on the German Minister’s letter. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Dr. Neligan to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Gulahek, September 17, 1909. THE sixty-eighth meeting of the Sanitary Council was held on the 6th September. Dr. Coppin, the president, was in the chair. The principal business was the consideration of the reply to he sent to the German Minister in answer to a letter which be had addressed to the president. A copy of this letter, given to me hy Dr. Coppin, is attached. The letter raises four points :— 1. The immediate publication of changes in the Quarantine Regulations. Article 10 of the Convention of Paris, referred to by the German Minister, provides that the Government of each country shall give immediate notice of any such changes. Owing to the disordered state of the Ministry of Poreign Affairs, notice of recent changes, though sent to the Persian Government by Dr. Coppin and Captain Williams, has not been immediately communicated to the foreign representa tives at Tehran. It was therefore decided by the meeting to advise the Persian Government to instruct Captain M illiams to inform the consular representatives at Bushire of any changes in the Quarantine Regulations. The president was instructed to notify Count Quadt of the decision of the council, and at the same time to add that the council was not, and would not be, responsible^ for the publication of quarantine regulations. This was the business of the Persian Government as laid down in the convention. . As a matter of fact, Captain Williams posts all changes m the quarantine regulations at his office, so that consular representatives at Bushire and shipping agents can, and should, keep themselves informed of new notices However, the point is not a serious one, and so, in view of the inefficiency of the Centra overnmen , ic decision of the council is a reasonable one. n l Dr. Coppin, in conversation with me about the letter, told me that Count Quadt had said that he did not understand why his Government had written to him on ic subject. Presumably, then, some German shipping him la comp am Government, and not the legation here. 2. The proposal to publish Sanitary Police Regulations. This was passed over at the meeting. Dr. Ijborg ^ insisted that Dr. Coppin told me that in conversation with Count Quadt he had insisted that the convention covered all the necessary ground. • j a i |i lp counc ii to This question has been raised before, and it wa f s ^ “? rl fLce in DiTkey! draw up a set of local rules for the g^ f , sue as,^ ^ ^ to ^ themj Hie matter, however, was dropped. It mi &amp; i inr , f ii P for interference in gulf as their absence provides the German Legation with a handle lor inteiterenee in gui affairs. [2475 66—1] Copy sent to Local Government Board, October 28, 1909.3. The proposal to form complete quarantine stations (such as exists at Bushire) in the south and the north of the gulf as well as at Bunder Abbas and Lingah. Article 35 of the convention provides that every country shall have at least one f ull y equipped (disinfecting stove, Clayton apparatus^lazarets) quarantine station on each sea frontier. The gulf has one such station—Bushire. The letter of the convention has therefore been complied with; but over and above this there are disinfecting stoves and lazarets (though indifferent ones) at Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Task, and Mohammerah. The gulf would therefore appear to be particularly well protected. The proof of the pudding is in the eating—neither plague nor cholera has gained a footing in Persia, though endemic at Bombay, Kurrachee, and Bahrein, places which are in constant communication with Persia. In addition, there are stoves at Bahrein and Muscat, though these places are not Persian territory. The council replied to the proposal in the above sense, and stated that it was satisfied with the quarantine precautions, although the lazarets left much to be desired; in the present state of the finances of the country it was hopeless to think of improving them. 4. The proposal to form a mobile Sanitary Service. The danger of the “ cabotage ” has long been recognised by the council, and so when the question of improving the personnel and apparatus of the Gulf Service was discussed in 1907-8 the council asked for a mobile assistant for Captain Williams, and a portable disinfecting stove. Botli have been provided. In replying to this point, the president was instructed to point this out to the German Minister. I have, &amp;c. A. R. NELIGAN, M.D. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Count Quadt to the President of the Sanitary Council. 51. le President, [JVim date'e.] SUE les instances de mon Gouvernement, j’ai l lionneur de porter a ]a connais- sance du Conseil sanitaire ce qui suit:— II est de toute necessite que la publication des mesures de police sanitaire prescrite par 1 article 10 de la convention internationale du 3 decembre, 1903, soit faite sans retard, avant que 1 on ait commence a executer ces mesures. Par la publica tion prealable les interesses ont la possibilite de se conformer pour leurs affaires aux nom elles^ mesures de quarantine. II serait done desirable que le Conseil sanitaire tout en emettant un nouveau r^glement de quarantine par lequel les droits et les devoirs de la police sanitaire doivent etre regies, y ajoutat un article pour assurer la publication reguliere et immediate des mesures sanitaires prises a nouveau. Par 1 etablissement d une station quarantenaire a Bouchir le Conseil sanitaire s est coniorme a 1 article 35 de la convention internationale susmentionnee. II serait quand meme desirable d eriger d autres stations au sud et au nord du Golfe Persique ainsi qu’a Bender-Abbas et a Lingah. L experience a piouve dans d autres parages—comme, pour exemple, sur la cote egyptienne de la Mer Rouge et sur la c6te de la colonie allemande de TAfrique onentale que ce sont les petits voiliers qui, en faisant le service du petit cabotage, sont les poiteurs principaux des epidemies. La proposition de parer a ce danger par des etablissements sanitaires ambulants, servant en meme temps pour la surreillance et le tiaitement des malades, semble digne detre pris en consideration par le Conseil sanitaire.

There are three Englishmen on the council and one American; the Russian and French representatives have voted with them on questions of importance during the past two years, so have the majority of the twelve Persian representatives. It will therefore be safe to prophesy that the British side of any question will command a majority for some time to come. In October 1907 the German Legation very nearly succeeded in getting one of its own doctors appointed as Dutch delegate to the council, in fact, the then Dutch Minister practically assured the legation that a German doctor would be nominated. At the last minute, however, and without explanation, he appointed Dr. Georges, a Frenchman. Baron Richtofen, the German chargd d’affaires, was very much annoyed. There can be little doubt that the German Legation intends, by means such as have been detailed above, to strengthen its powers of interference in affairs connected with the Persian Gulf. Indeed, the German Minister has again raised the question of the sanitary defence of the Gulf in a letter read at the last meeting of the Sanitary Council, held on the 6th September.
