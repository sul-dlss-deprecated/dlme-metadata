Hie opening of a second bank in Bahrain v*ill undoubtedly cause alarm to the has tern Bank, and while there is every justification lor the opening of a second bank, and so securing competition, they may well feel that, as in Basrah, the Ottoman Bank would also wish to open up and that they may therefore shortly have to face the competition of yet a third Bank. 2. While there is certainly ample business for two banks, I do not think that there is enough scope for three, and they would simply cut each others throats. 1 would be glad, therefore, if you would kindly approach His Highness Shaikh Salman and expl a in the position and inquire if he would be good enough to give us an undertaking not to permit the opening of a third bank for a period of ten years so that we c&amp;n reassure the Eastern Bank ?

In discussion with their General Manager Immediately after receiving the information. I learned that their representative, Mr, lyere (Taiyers) visited Bahrain recently for the purpose of making enquiries with a view to opening a Branch and has since gone to India to recruit staff, purchase stationery etc. I should be interested to kno when he visited Bahrain, vdbith whom he stayed there and why his presenc for such a purpose was not known and reported to us before. The General Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran expressed the hope that our respective Managers (when their) Branch opened) would be good friends socially although competitors in business. This is something which I must le»ve in yopir hands t but what hurts us most is the evidence that in w r time they can spare the staff for uhat we , regard as an enroachnent on our territory whilst we. erwing to the release of personnel for w*r services, find the gre-test difficulty in providing the staff for our legitimate needs. Pie se telegraph us immediately if and when you hear that the. Imperial Bank of Tran are about to open.' / J | j \iTHE EASTERN BANK, LIMITED, BAHRAIN, 7th November, 1944 i Dear Mr. Golder, With reference te the last paragraph in my letter •f 28th ultimo, I have new had an opportunity of a friendly discussion with The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., on business prospects in Dubai and Muscat. Sir Geoffrey is of opinion that the trade boom which has been flourishing in these ports during the past three years is due entirely to the War and the resultant black market and that it will dwindle when conditions return to normal. He pointed out that it was possible that Ling ah would become a free port after the War and this would greatly affect the trade of Dubai, as imports for Iran would then pass through the former port. At the same time he indicated that, as the present prosperity of Dubai was closely connected with Iranian trade, The Imperial Bank of Iran would be able to handle the business from Bahrain. In view of the above I am not taking any further steps to visit Dubai at present. Should the oil companies start work on the Trucial Coast however, the situation should be reviewed again. Sir Geoffrey then brought up the question of our competitor and informed me confidentially that he decided two years ago that there should be another bank in Bahrain. This decision was arrived at after a discussion he had with some of the leading merchants here in October 1942. He assured me that no other bank would be allowed to open here within ten years from now. ‘, Esquire, al Manager, The Eastern Bank, Ltd., London, E.C.3.I would add here that Sir Geoffrey and I were close friends in 1931/32 when he was Captain Prior, Political Agent, Bahrain. He was also a friend of Barden, ay predecessor, and I ara sure we can still look ©n him as a friend of the Eastern Bank Limited. Yours sincerely,D«0«No«C/ 0 I . ^ ' 29th November 19*±4.

I now enclose a copy of the correspondence on the subject. I obtained it from the Bahrain agency files and Jakins reports that from his records it appears that our object at the time was to keep the Cttoman Bank out of Bahrain. Even if we were to absolve the Shaikh from the undertaking, I very much doubt if he would welcome the opening of a Branch of the State Bank of Pakistan in Bahrain. (SGD). W.R. HAY. B.A.B.
