An opportunity occurs to undertake an explora tion of the interior of Nejd, by means of an European non official 'who is thoroughly conversant with Arabic and r Arab customs, and has not only already made many trips in the interior but is also personally known to many of the most influential Shaikhs. The exploration would take best part of a year and would probably cost about £500. * As the country to be explored will reach close to Medinah, you may be inclined to participate; and I sug gest that in that case you might undertake to meet one- third of the total cost, the remaining two-thirds being met by Indian Intelligence Funds. If you agree, it may save time if you would ob tain the sanction of the Foreign and India Offices, and in case of approval, cable to me accordingly, in order that the necessary arrangements may be made in good time.

I think you will fine when you come to look into the map that we have incorporated everything from the v'.O. map; Lorimer's map is of a very small scale comparatively speaking, and does not contain much that is net on our new map, if indeed there is anything left out.

[FROM OUK LATE CORRESPONDENT IN TURKEY.] v my last letter I gave some details of the impressions gained in Berlin in the course of an interview with one of the rising Diplo matists in Germany and I ventured to offer another letter dealing with my curtailed visit to Constantinople. So far as the outside of the cup and the platter, is concerned, I see but little change since the olden days when I first knew the place and wandered through the bazaars more especially those devoted to lorseflesh with your late Viceroy. There are fewer dogs and fewer police en evidence, the pavements are as villainous and the streets, as * mal-odorous as ever, and the Greek charioteers as careless of the well-being of their excellent little tats as before. The troops have exchang ed the bad fitting blue uniforms for equally bad fitting clothes of a khaki hue. The accou trements and saddlery and harness of the Artil- leiy appear to have been in some measure im proved and from what I saw at the parade grounds at Taxim and Daoud Pasha consider able attention is being paid to regimental and battalion movements. In the days of Abdul Hamid no battalion parade could be held with out an Imperial Iradeh; the subalterns of the army strongly disapprove of such wide powers being placed in the hands of the Officer Com- I manding a battalion. Daily parades are a most confounded nuisance, said one genial youngster tome. Such a remark cirried me back to the pre-historic days when I was soldiering at Alla habad, and our Colonel in a fit of zeal gave us a gruelling on three successive days, a dose of which we were much in need. On the third morning, one of the senior, captains came into the mess with the exclamation Z “ this is too much of a good thing. Look here I’ll take a thousand to go or if....does I’ll give three thousand for the majority.” The Major did not rise to the bait, but a senior Lieutenant promptly accepted the offer and the regiment was bereft of a Captain who had been through the Crimea and Mutiny with more than usual credit. However this is another story. In outward ap pearance 1 do not think there is much change in the Turkish army, and I am sorry to say that I do not think the German method at all suited to the Turk. Von der Goltz is an able writer and I have no doubt an excellent organiser, but his experience of war is meagre and out of date and he hjis no practical knowledge of any army but his own. Barrack yard drill is not needed in Turkey, to the extent that it is now carried on. “ Right turn, left turn, take the beggar’s name down ” seems to be the principle on which things are done, the men are practiced for hours at the ridiculous knee action step so dear to the Prussian soldier, they are shod in the high boot which is abhorrent to the man who has been accustomed from his infancy to sandals, and the two years he spends with the colours is not sufficient to wed him to the new style of foot gear. Just when his feet are becoming used to the high boot, he passes -pito the Reserve, back he goes with smiling cheerfulness to the sandal, then comes a fresh call to arms and he has to habituate himself to the hated boot. One Fane or Brownlow would do more for the Turkish Army than a hundred Von der Goltzes. Whilst a handful of German officers and a few s core of Turks who have gone through a certain German training are drilling the old Turk out of remembrance, the Marshal with the aid of a few be-speetacled pedants is re-arranging the organisation which dates from the days of Von Moltke. Sir John Lawrence used to say of his Chief Engineer in the early days of th e Punjab that “ Napier thought in lakhs.’’ Well Von der Goltz thinks in millions. How long the little game will last I do not know, but Turkey is perilously near bankruptcy at present and if military expenditure is not checked heaven knows when the storm will break. The new scheme is excellent in every way, but it adds some three million annually to the military budget,'and though that is a small insurance against war, for a wealthy State, it is more than Turkey can afford to pay. Before I touch on the new organisation, it will be necessary for me to remind your readers of the old. For the past thirty years Turkey has been divided into seven military districts each, maintaining one army corps with two additional divisions in the Iledjaz (that is the district of Mecca and Medina) and Tripoli in Africa. Roughly speaking the army corps consisted of two divisions of infantry and one of cavalry, each comprising 34 batta lions, 80 squadrons and 126 guns and numbering some 40,000 men on a war footing. The headquarters of the seven corps were at Constantinople, Adrianople, Salonica, Damascus, Erzindjan, Baghdad, and Yemen. Although universal military service was theoretically the law there were many exemptions. Chmtians paid a small tax in lieu of service, the inhabit ants of the capital were from time immemorial free, as were those of Scutari in Albania, whilst Albanians and Kurds served when it so pleased them. The latter were formed into regiments of Irregular Horse under their tribal chieftains, a system which suited them admirably. They were armed at the expense of the State, and were thus able to carry on unofficial war with their Armenian neighbours without let or hindrance. Men liable for service passed nine years in the Nizam or active ' army, three with the colours and six in the Reserve ; they then were drafted into the Redif or Reserve in which they passed a second period of nine years. Theoretically every battal- j ion of the active army had two battalions ( of the Redifs—one with cadres of Officers complete, the other commonly called Second C'lass Redif, were unorganised, the men being xable to service, but the regiments being in a nebulous condition. Practically the whole military burden fell upon about 8 million Moslems, a manifest injustice. Thanks to an old friend who has been in com mand of one of the old army corps, I have been favoured with an epitome of Marshal Von der Goltz’s new scheme. It does not err on the side of econorny. Instead of seven ? there are | no less than 14 army corps, and in lieu of the two independent divisions in the Iledjaz and Tripoli there are no less than five. Under the old scheme there were but two army corps in Europe, and for many years the second corps at Salonica had grown to an unwieldy size owing to large reinforcements from other corps in Asia.THE PIONEER’ FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1911. THE REORGANIZATION OF THE Turkish army. [tHOM OUH LATR CORUESPONOENT IN TURKEY.] In last letter I gave some details of the impressions gained in Berlin in the course of an interview with one of the rising Diplo matists in Germany and I ventured to offer mother letter dealing with my curtailed visit to Constantinople. So far as the outside of the CU P and the platter, is concerned, I see but little change since the olden days when I first knew the place and wandered through the bazaars more especially those devoted to horseflesh with your late Viceroy. There are fewer dogs and fewer police en evidence, the pavements are as villainous and the streets, as 1 mal-odorous as ever, and the Greek charioteers as careless of the well-being of their excellent little tats as before. The troops have exchang ed the bad fitting blue uniforms for equally bad fitting clothes of a khaki hue. The accou trements and saddlery and harness of the Artil lery appear to have been in some measure im proved and from what I saw at the parade grounds at Taxim and Daoud Pasha consider able attention is being paid to regimental and battalion movements. In the days of Abdul Hamid no battalion parade could be held with out an Imperial Iradeh ; the subalterns of the army strongly disapprove of such wide powers being placed in the hands of the Officer Com manding a battalion. Daily parades are a most confounded nuisance, said one genial youngster tome. Such a remark carried me back to the pre-historic days when I was soldiering at Alla habad, and our Colonel in a fit of zeal gave us a gruelling on three successive days, a dose of which we were much in need. On the third morning, one of the senior, captains came into the mess with the exclamation Z il this is too much of a good thing. Look here IT1 take a thousand to go or if.... does I’ll give three thousand for the majority.” The Major did not rise to the bait, but a senior Lieutenant promptly accepted the offer and the regiment was bereft of a Captain who had been through the Crimea and Mutiny with more than usual credit. However this is another story. In outward ap pearance 1 do not think there is much change in the Turkish army, and I am sorry to say that I do not think the German method at all suited to the Turk. Von der Goltz is an able writer and I have no doubt an excellent organiser, but his experience of war is meagre and out of date and he h*is no practical knowledge of any army but his own. Barrack yard drill is not needed in Turkey, to the extent that it is now carried on. “ Piight turn, left turn, take the beggar’s name down ” seems to be the principle on which things are done, the men are practiced for hours at the ridiculous knee action step so dear to the Prussian soldier, they are shod in the high boot which is abhorrent to the man who has been accustomed from his infancy to sandals, and the two years he spends with the colours is not sufficient to wed him to the new style of foot gear. Just when his feet are becoming used to the high boot, he passes -into the Reserve, back he goes with smiling cheerfulness to the sandal, then comes a fresh call to arms and he has to habituate himself to the hated boot. One Fane or Brownlow would do more for the Turkish Army than a hundred Von dcr Goltzes. Whilst a handful of German officers and a few s core of Turks who have gone through a certain German training are drilling the old Turk out of remembrance, the Marshal with the aid of a few be-speetaeled pedants is re-arranging the organisation which dates from the days of Von Moltke. Sir John Lawrence used to say of his Chief Engineer in the early days of th e Punjab that “ Napier thought in lakhs.” Well Von der Goltz thinks in millions. How long the little game will last I do not know, but Turkey is perilously near bankruptcy at present and if military expenditure is not checked heaven knows when the storm will break. The new scheme is excellent in every way, but it adds some three million annually to the military budget,'and though that is a small insurance against war, for a wealthy State, it is more than Turkey can afford to pay. Before I touch on the new organisation, it will be necessary for me to remind your readers of ^he old. For the past thirty years Turkey has been divided into seven military districts each, maintaining one army corps with two additional divisions in the Iledjaz (that is the district of Mecca and Medina) and Tripoli in Africa. Roughly speaking the army corps consisted of two divisions of infantry and one of cavalry, each comprising ,34 batta lions, 30 squadrons and 126 guns and numbering some 40,000 men on a war footing. The headquarters of the seven corps were at Constantinople, Adrianople, Salonica, Damascus, Erzindjan, Baghdad, and Yemen.

The remaining 7 corps have their headquarters in Asia, and the indepen dent divisions of the Iledjaz and Tripoli are retained intact. The Army Corps are much reduced in size, their normal strength being 21 battalions of infantry. 4 regiments of cavalry 3 squadrons of mounted infantry and 24 field batteries of 4 guns. The distribution of the army has for the present been fixed as under I Corps at Constantinople, II at Rodostoon the sea of Marmora covering the left flank of the famous Tchataldja Lines, III Corps at Adrianople facing the Bulgarian Frontier, IV Corps Kirk Kilissa facing Eistern Rounielia, The V Corps has its h eadquarters at Salonica, and is of course d estined either as a reserve to the Macedonian Corps or to act .against Greece in Thessaly, the VI Corps is at Monastir, the VII at Uskub. These two Corp^ are, of course, the point of the lance so far as Western Bulgaria, Servia and Montenegro are concerned, but the Monastir Corps would also act as a support to any invasion of Greece by way of Epirus. In Macedonia and Albania are the three independent divisions, one at Scutari in Albania one at Kotchana in the centre of Albania, and one at Janina in the south facing the Greek Frontier at Arta. The VIII Corps has jts headquarters at Damascus, the home of the old oth Corps. The IX Corps is at Erzeroum facing the Russian Frontier at Kars : it has as its Western support the X Corps at Erzindjan, and to the South the XI Corps at Van, the XII is at Mosul on the Tigris and the XIII at Bagdad. The XIV follows the old 7th Corps in the Yemen and the two independent divisions in the Iledjaz and Tripoli remain untouched. This massing of troops at Van, Mosul and Bagdad shows very clearly that the Turco-German Alliance does not intend to allow Russia a free hand in the partition of Persia. The grouping of the army corps is instructive. It will be seen that three, II, III, and IV, cover the capital and can act against the Eastern Frontier of Bulgaria. Three, the V, VI and VII are destined to act against either the Western Frontiers of Bulgaria or against Servia or Montenegro. The V and VI with the Janina Division are a perpetual re- ' minder to Greece to be on her best behaviour. The IX, X and XI are to act in unison under one Inspecting General against Russia, whilst the XI, XII and XIII are enough to ensure respect | for Turkish rights in Persia. I have said that the normal war strength of i a^ army corps has been fixed at 21 battalions of infantry, 4 regiments of cavalry, 3 squadrons | of mounted infantry and 24 field batteries. The coips, however, vary in their composition and the independent divisions vary in strength. Ihe I Corps at Constantinople consists of 21 j battalions of infantry, 4 regiments of cavalry 24 field and 2 horse batteries with 38 com panies of fortress artillery. The II Corps at Rodosto is of normal strength with 40 companies of fortress artillery. I be III Corps at Adrinople has 2 horse, 4 howitzer and 4 mountain batteries with 12 companies of fortress artillery, in additional to its normal strength. The IV Corps at Kirk Kilissa ha« been in creased by 2 horse, 4 howitzer and 4 mountain batte ies with 8 companies of fortress artil lery. The V Corps at Salonica has 2 horse, 6 howitzer, and 4 mountain batteries with 6 garrison companies above its establishment. The VI Corps at Monastir has an additional 2 horse, 8 howitzer, 8 mountain batteries an&lt;i 12 companies of fortress artillery. The VII Corps at Uskub has 2 horse, 8 howit zer and 8 mountain batteries, with 6 companies of mounted infantry added to its strength. The Independent Division at Scutari in Albania comprises 12 battalions of infantry, 4 com panies of mounted infantry, 6 companies of fortress artillery and 8 mountain batteries. The Independent Division at Janina consists of 12 battalions of infantry, 8 companies of mounted infantry, 6 companies of fortress artillery and 6 field and 8 mountain batteries, &gt; with one regiment of cavalry. The Independent Division at Kotchana consists of 0 battalions of infantry, 6 companies of mounted Infantry and 4 mountain batteries! We now come to the army in Asia. The VIII Corps at Damascus is of normal strength except in the matter of cavalry and | taking advantage of the horse supply in Syria it comprises 6 regiments of cavalry and 3 horse batteries and it has 4 companies of fortress artillery. The IX Corps at Erzeroum has 6 howitzer and ft mountain batteries with 32 companies of fortress artillery to man the important works, these will shortly be increased and a commission of German officers is drawing up plans for the more perfect defence of the key of Armenia. Its mounted force has been strengthened by no less than 36 companies of Kurdish Mounted Infantry. The. X Corps at Erzindjan has 2 horse, 6 how itzer and 4 mountain batteries’in addition tO' the normal strength, ae well as 24 companies of Kurdish Mounted Infantry. I he XI Corps at Van has only 4 field batter ies, but the deficiency is’made good by 12 mount- tain batteries, and it has no cavalry in its com position, but in lieu has no less than 24 compan- uies of Kurds as mounted infantry. The XII Corps at Mosul like the one at Van has no cavalry nor horse artillery, the 24 field batteries 'are reduced to 4, it has in exchange 6 mountain batterieslmd 12 companies of mount ed infantry raised from the Kurdish tribes in the vicinity. The XIII Corps at Baghdad has but 6 field batteries, but it has an additional horse battery and 6 regiments of cavalry. The XIV Corps at Sanaa in the Yemen has only 4 field and the same number of mountain batteries. It has no cavalry, but its mounted infantry has been raised to a strength of 8 com panies and there are 4 companies of fortress artillery. The two independent corps in the Hedjaz and at Tripoli are of a strength of 6 and 12 battalions respectively. No change has been made in the terms of service beyond shortening the period wit* the colours to 2 years in the case of the '' s —^ , 1 or Draft.) case may be, has the charge of their drill, dis^ I cipline and training in time of peace. Now let me turn to tho question of reserves. I The old system still hold good. After having put in his two years with the colours the men for Seven years are borne on the active list of the Army and on mobilisation join the Nizam o r active battalions, thus bringing them up to war strength and supplying a large number o f men in the prime of life to fill up the wastage of w ar. On the completion of 9 years in the Nizam the men pass into the liedif of the first class, in j which they remain for 5 years. In this category there are 342 battalions and these battalions have been organised into regiments, and divi sions complete, so that on mobilisation the second line is ready to ta ke the field. As a third line, come the men of the second Redif who again have been allotted to their respective battalions and regiments. The organisation of these 342 battalions into divisions is not yet complete, and it is difficult to see w r here the Minister of War will find officers to command such a large force. In all its wars the lack of i good, superior officers has been the bar to success in Turkey. Here by the Yon der Goltz scheme we find a necessity for 5 Inspecting Generals qualified to command an army in time of war ; we next require 13 officers com petent to command an army corps in the field S,qd 47 divisional goneralsL Leaving on one side tll9 question of officers we «iome to the scarcely less important one of horses for the mobile troops and for transport. For the 42 regiments of cavalry no less than 32 ,OOq and for the horse and field 'artillery 43,00 horses are necessary, the greater majo rity of these certainly, those for the Artillery must for many years to come be purchased either from Hungary or from Russia. The studs in Turkey have been much neglected and consi derable difficulty is experienced in obtaining horses for the cavalry of the army corps in Europe. Marshal Shefket Pasha, the Minister of War, ms a fervent admirer of Von der Goltz and is determined that the Turkish army shall be put ©n an efficient footing. This side of the Cabinet has been strengthened by the nomination of my old friend Mahmoud Moukhtar Pasha as ^Minister of Marine. He is one of the best soldiers in the Turkish army and I am sure would sooner find himself Inspecting Officer of one of the mili tary areas, but the Turkish navy is not likely to suffer in his hands. The Minister of finance and the Armenian who rules at the Ministry of ( Public Works would like to curtail the expen diture on the army. But they are powerless before the strong support which Shefket Pasha can secure in the Chamber. Al ready a contract has been signed for a further supply of 350,000 Mauser rifles to complete the armament of the Redif battalions with rifles of the same calibre as those carried by the infantry of the active army and a Solingen firm has secured an order for 120,000 sabres in face of the opposition of two well- known English houses. Krupp, too, has secured an order for 100 field and 60 batteries of howitzer. Of these the major part are of 8-inch calibre throwing a shell weighing 200 pounds and carrying a charge of 34 pounds of a high '^plosive. * enlistment of Christians is proceeding,v^&gt; v bio. 3 // of 1911.

Books. ARMY HEADQUARTERS, INDIA. General Staff Branch ; Dated Simla, April 1911. Memorandum regarding the verification and amplification of the information con tained in hooks and maps relating to Persia. It is particularly requested that all officers to whom books of reference and maps relating to Persia are issued by the General Staff, India, will take advantage of et'ery opportunity to verify the information contained therein, and to supply the General Staff with such additions and corrections as may appear necessary. 2. The information should be marked “ Confidential ” and should be address ed to the Chief of the General Staff (M. 0.3) Army Headquarters, Simla. 3. In order to facilitate the work of compilation at Headquarters, the follow ing points should be borne in mind:— (H) Gazetteer .—Gazetteer information about any place, etc., should be given as a correction or addition to the existing article. Where no such article exists, a new article should be written, following the lines of the Gazetteers issued. If possible, an accurate rendering of the name of the place in the vernacular should be given, so as to allow of proper transliteration in accordance with the system now m vogue. Attention is directed to the desirability of checking and providing details of armed strengths, armament, etc. of villages and tribes. (B) Routes .—Information regarding routes should be given as a correction or addition to the existing route. If a new route is written, the lines of the existing route books should be followed. (C) Authorities. —Each item of information should be accompanied by the name of the officer who personally made the observation, and the month and year in which it was recorded. (D) Maps.—Maps, dated 1910 or later, have all been compiled by the Sur vey of India, at whose disposal all the latest information and material is placed by the General Staff. These maps have further been scruti nized carefully by the General Staff and all corrections and addi tions incorporated before issue. When using, and collecting further, topographical information the following points should be remembered:— (a) The majority of the areas covered have been surveyed by native sur veyors, with varying thoroughness, on scales of l // =4 or 8 miles ; and although details along routes may not always be accurate, or nearly sufficient, the main features of the hills, peaks, and streams, etc., are probably relatively correct and, in a general sense, accurate. (h) Any corrections or additions to the existing map should, therefore, be sent on a trace or copy of it, or a definite statement as to the incorrect ness of the map made. A separate sketch should be accompanied by an explanakon showing how it fits on to the existing details in the map. Without such explana- . tion, the sketch may be useless for compilation.(c) As regards choice of scales, atea and route reconnaissance sketches, in these Transfrontier areas (except in the case of proposed road or rail way routes), should not be on a larger scale than I'^l mile. In cases where a large distance or area is likely to be traversed within a limited time, l'—2 miles or l // =4 mi'es is quite large enough. It is better to cover a large area with general features, clearly marked, than to waste time in filling in detail on a larger scale which is not likely to be of real value in the future, and which covers a much smaller area. (d) Of the 1*=1 mile and l // =4 miles maps of the country round Bandar Abbas and the l'—! mile round Lingeh, reconnaissance map work should be confined to checking the detail given, which is believed to be reliable. (e) Information as to perennial water, springs, wells, etc; river crossings; nature of roads; etc.; authority and date, should always be stated: thus—- [$pr : g. w. {Plentiful and said to he 'perennial—Captain Smith, April 1911.) or Route—Impassable after rains—Native information, 1911.] (/) In desert areas, particular attention should be given to supplying inform ation as to water.

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political De partment. &gt; Jn cormection ^ subject of my immediately preceding letter of to- ay s ate, have the honour to submit to Government a point which appears i^ 0 j. S °Ti e ln !. erest ; th f[ . the distinction between the notification of changes, w ich directly affect the Lighting and Buoying arrangements in the Persian Gulf tor which we are responsible and the notification of information of interest to navigation such as sunken wrecks, formation of shoals, approach of typhoons, ., regarding which His Majesty’s Consular officers serving in the Gulf have occasionally to inform British shipping in their vicinity. It appears to me that a t u 1 ' 0 L f . int . ernatl0I i ial comit y an d On account of the predominant character ot British shipping m the Gulf, which puts British Consuls in a more favourable position to receive information of this character, our foreign colleagues are in courtesy entitled to receive from us such information of this character as we issue to Dntish shipping. But whereas information of the first kind should, in my opinion, be com- municated officially on account of our direct responsibility in the matter it appears to me desirable to emphasise the distinction I have drawn above by the Consul concerned, sending to his Foreign Colleague “informally in case it may prove of interest a copy of the notification that he is issuing to British ship ping hirms. I he occasions for such communications are not frequent, would involve little extra labour and would, I think, be appreciated. The procedure is, however, at any rate at Bushire, an innovation, and I hesitate to introduce it without knowing that my views, as I have given them above, are approved by higher authority. ’ ' i ^.^d a C0 Py of this letter to his Majesty’s Foreign and India Offices, and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. ^ of it.
