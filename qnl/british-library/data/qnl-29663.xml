Dear Dalton, tfith reference to Earner's letter to Donaldson No.E.5355/267/91 of the 31st October, about the proposed modification of the United States-Muscat Treaty, I write to send you our comments on the Washington Chancery’s letter of the 15th October, which we have now examined in detail. In the first place, we think that, though the State Department’s note is not very explicit, the Washington Embassy are probably right in their view that it would be extremely difficult to induce the United States Government to conclude a new treaty which did not include provisions according general most-favoured-nation treatment to American nationals - at least within any reasonable time. Now that the point has arisen it is hard' ly likely that the United States Government will lightly abandon it. In any case they would almost certainly want to know the exact reasons why Muscat cannot give United States citizens full most-favoured-nation rights, and, although we may ourselves regard those rehsons as adequate I doubt whether they would appear equally convincing to the United States Government. If however you feel that a reasonably strong case can be made, we should of course be glad to discuss the point further. Under (3) and (4) of the Chancery's letter of the 15th October, two suggestions are made for getting over the difficulty which has arisen. The first is that the proposal to modify the French and United States treaties should be dropped, and that ther ate of the tariff should be raised against all goods other khan those covered by ther elevant articles of these treaties: i.e. against all goods J.C.Walton, Esq.,C.B. ,M.O .; ( 5 ) goods other than those imported into Muscat in French and United States vessels. In that event, goods carried in Dutch vessels would, presumably, also have to he exempted from the increase in the duties in view of the most favoured-nation provisions of the Netherlands-Muscat Treaty. You will remember that, -when this proposal wa 9 considered LjlJUvl, tf- Uawu, /that it would be undesirable to put the French, Americans and Dutch in a privileged position, which, we thought, it would be more difficult to get them to abandon later on when the new duties had come into force and they had begun to profit by their exemption. (See paragraph 3 of our official letter E 6207/166/91 of the 31st January,1930). This argument was a valid one so long as there seemed a chance of bringing the United States and France into line in time to get the new duties imposed on all goods alike without undue delay. But if, as seems to be the case, we have now reached a deadlock with the United Sbates govern ment in regard to the modification of their treaty, and if there is consequently no hope of securing a modification of the French treaty, this consideration no longer alto gether applies. Indeed, by waiting for United States concurrence for what may prove to be an indefinite time, we may only be uselessly preventing Muscat from imposing duties without further delay on what may s till prove to be the bulk of her imports (i.e. on goods imported in ships not flying the United States, French or Dutch flags), and thus redressing her finances at a moment when they are in a critical condition. The suggestion in (3) of the Ciiancery's letter may, however, be open to the objection that importers would and could arrange for a large part of the imports into Muscat to be brought in in vessels flying the French, United States or Netherlands flag. The Resident in the Persian Gulf could no doubt gi^re an opinion on this point. But *£' iO w 6 r© found tlnsit/ tiinis was iDGing dono on a seal© which was defeating the purpose of the new tariff, presuma- My the tariff could, 'be lowered again, and we should he no worse off than we are now, while Muscat would have at any rate made some money meanwhile. Indeed a possible solution ^ would he to make the increase definitely provisional or temporary. Under (4) the Washington Chancery suggest that use could perhaps he made of an argument hy analogy from the St.Germain Convention. I enclose a copy of the Washington telegram of the 8 th April, 1930 referred to .and of our | reply. It was at that time considered undesirable to argue with the United Sta&amp;es Government that the St.Germain Convention involved the supgrsession of the restrictive provisions of the United States- Muscat Treaty of 1833 in respect of Zanzibar; it was therefore impossible to use the argument 'by analogy' in connection with Muscat. The position is still much the same. The question whether His Majesty's Government should approach the United States Government -ith a via.; to -n xr participating in a proposal to extend the St.Germain Conven tion for a further five years is now under discussion (see Foreign Office letter to India Office No.J.3139/21/60 of the 17th November). Our Egyptian Department, who deal with Zanzibar questions, tell us that it would be undesirable to attempt to use the argument suggested in (4) of the Washing ton Chancery's letter until the United States Government, if, His Majesty's Government decide to approach them, agree to participate in the extension of the St.Germain Convention and until the extending protocol is signed and comes into force. This the Egyptian Department think, would inevitably take a long time. It seems therefore that the Jashington Embassy's second suggestion is impracticable - at any rate for the time being You will no dou*bt let me know if you would like to discuss this difficult question with us orally.

Though it is our view that the Convention of St. Germain supersed* s conflicting stipulations in previous treaties, all that at present appears necessary or desirable is that Your Excellency should remind the State Department that your predecessor’s note of 31st January,1929 is still unanswered. Should the reply when received prove to be unsatisfactory, we could then argue that Article 2 of the Convention, according to our interpretation of it, releases us from the restrictive provisions of the Treaty of 1833. Argument by analogy in favour of similar concession by United States Government in regard to 1'uscat cannot therefore be used at present.

Please see foreign office Demi-official 1 -etter No. S.5355/267/91 dated 4th December, 1931, copy oy air mail of 11 th. Dec. It appears to me that, if early effect is to he given to desire of Muscat to increase tariff rates, two courses are open:- (a) that proposal to modify french and United States treaties should he dropped, and th&amp;t the rates of the tariff should he raised against all goods otcer than thc^ carried in french and American bottoms and those covered by the Qommercial Deoiaratiron between Museat ana the Netherlands of 1377. This course would,of coi.rse , in- -volve modification of Article 6 of Anglo-Muscat Treaty of 1891. (h) to agree to the American demand for most favoured nation treatment in respect of nationals as well as of goods. Objections to (a) are stated in para 3 of foreign Office letter No. E.6207/166/91 dated 31st January, 1S30 and para 4 of your telegram &gt;T o 135 2 -S dated l 7 th M ay 1931. Objections to (h) in Political rvesiaents telegram No T/ 34/35cdated 15th February, 1931. It does not-appear ttat any of these objections is insuperable. As regards (a) there i-s. is force in considerations advanced in Foreign Office letter its of 4th December, 1931 and their suggestion that the increase should be made definitely provisional, at any rate in tie first instance2 instance. This would apparently go far to obviate both# the objections referred to in Foreign office letter of 'So'^ tilth January 1S30 and your telegram of 17tu May, 1931. It may be doubted whether there is, in practice, much risjj: of the French and .Americans endeavouring seriously to exploit any temporary advantage which they might en~ cy on pap er. As regards(b):- (l)? Entry of undesirable foreigners, whether missionarie or others, coiId be controlled as it is in India, by means of visa system. As regards prospect of American mission- caries residing at places like Sur ( meniioned in Politi- -cal -resident's telegram of 15th February, 1931) coula not this be controlled by making grant of visa subject to whatever conditions as to residence are considered necess- -ary? So far as American merchants are concerned tney appear already to have light of residence at all ports under Article 6 of the American treaty. (ii) It is true that American citizens would be plaeeci on same footing as British subjects as regards prospeet- -ing and utilisation of natural resources, but this seems a small price to pay for the revision of the tariff, and in any case existing concessions would not be effected. (iii) Grant of extra- territorial rights to American citizens would require further consideration, but regard- -ed as quId pro quo might perhaps be accepted. United States of America appear already to have right of consular jurisdiction in civil cases between American citizens ( Article 9 of American Treaty).

I thiiik proposal (b) t namely t to agree to American demands for most^favoured«nation treatment in respect o£ nationals as well as of goods, would be most distasteful to the Muscat State. Apart from the practical objections outlined in my telegram No.34/35, dated the 15th February 1931, we must take into consider* tion the question of amour proors which always looms large in dealings with an Oriental State, the State would certainly feel that they were beiqg asked to make a very large concession lor a very small quid uro quo * since, as pointed out dove, the risk of shipments in American bottoms is very slight, while in practice the Folitio&amp;l Agent would probably intervene in any matter affecting American missionaries the State would dislike openly having to surrender their present Jurisdiction. 6. If proposal (a) is approved is it necessary definitely to emphasise that the increased tariff rates are provisiorml ? Unless a state has definitely bound itself by treaty not to inertase rates for some specific period it would seem that all tariff rates are provisional and that every State has the right to raise or lower them as suits its own interests*from time to time# His Majesty's Government are doing this at present in England and the French Government have Just put on a 13$ surtax on British goods. Any tariff imposed at tfusoat would necessarily be more or less experimental in the first instance and modifications would douotleas be introduced from time to time as experience or circumstances showed to be advisable. definitely •..3- DefiniteXy to emptaAolse fact that increased rates were provisional might 9 X think, lead to misunderstanding and create uncertainty in the minds of merchante / who would probably think that rates would be lowered to previous level after a short period and might delay ordering goods. ad/- H.

I would respectfully submit that in this case there would be no practical preference but merely a theoretical one, since there are actually no French or American vessels carrying goods or trading in those parts# A preference which exists only in theory and not in practice can surely be ignored# 3. In support of their contention the Board of Trade quote the analogy of Portugal, and state that the effect of rebate on goods imported in Portuguese vessels has been to transfer • • •transfer the balk of the trade to Portuguese Teasels* I would submit that the case of Portugal lias no analogy with that of Muscat* In the case of Portugal there were presumably other ships standing by to oarry the goodsi in the case of iuacat there are not* and if there are no other steamere stand ing by to carry the goods the trade cannot be transferred to them* 4* The Board of Trade, however, point out that in 1928-29, the latest year for which they have figures,there were imported into Muscat goods to the value of £ 343,917, of which £ 238,589 came from India, and they state that they see no reason why it would not be possible to charter a vessel or veseels under *,iie united States or French flags to c&amp;rxy these goods, in which case the object of the proposal would be completely frustrated* The import figures for Muscat for the last two years are as follows} Steamers •• £ 177,000 £ 170,000 Sailing craft * * 109,000 ' 112,000* It will be seen that nearly 40 a of the goods are not imported in steamers at all, but in sailing erafti it makes little difference, in many oases, to a merchant in Muscat whether his goods take a week longer to reach Muscat, and the rates by sailing craft are considerably cheaper* Assuming that an enterprising Hindu merchant chartered a French ship to come to Muscat, the maximum volume of trade that he could hope to obtain would be about £ 170,000, einoe even with a small tariff preference in his favour he could not hope to compete with the sailing craft, especially as dhows convey goods direct to the smaller ports such as Bur, &gt;iohar, etc* It seems to me, if I may say so, in the highest degree improbable that it would be i worth • • *I'rJiJB UXiiCW aM lo &amp;mif jirfe icari^o wi* 03 i»'la o* xa a&amp;t*Z ftriif ouuu&amp; o^fii aoilt bluav H s^iali *$£ ^ ^ o £i. z) * r, *i tis ea*3«^ worth while to charter a French or American veesel for this very small rolume of trade # and still more improbable that any of the merchants who deal with Muscat would oe capable of financing a transaction of this nature, and monopolising the entire trade of the State, However, if the suggestion embodied in telegram Bo*669 of the 1st March 1932 from the Government of India is approved, even this risk,which I can not but regard as almost entirely theoretical,will, s^.ait, be adequately guarded against, since the authority given to the Muscat State would be at once abrogated if nited States, French or j)utch ships took advantage oi it, I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ATTESTED. sd/- H.V.Biscoe, Lt,Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, / &gt;. 4 JonfidentiaX Assistant.

E 3243/4/91 Foreign Office, 19th July 1932, nfi 4eriti4l* Sir, //ith reference to your letter No•F.Z,3146/32 of the 28th ^une, 1 am directed hy Secretary Sir John Simon to offer, for the consideration of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the following observations on the issue raised in paragraph 3 of despatch No.D1673/N/32 of the 11 th -^ay from the G-ovornment of India as to the possibility of the denunciation by the Muscat State of its treaties with foreign powers, more particularly those with France and the United States of America. 2. The Muscat State's treaties with France and the United States, of 1833 and 1844 respectively, contain no clause specifying that they may be ter- -minated. They contain provisions of varying character, the majority of them, including those which are the cause of the present difficulty re- -gtfftiing the Muscat 1 ariff, being provisions of a commercial treaty character, while others are of rather a different nature, certain of these in the Treaty with France being somewhat analagous to capitulations. 3. The Secretary of State id aavised that, according to the prevailing view, provisions of a commercial toature are presumed to toe not indeter- -minable, and, in the absence of express provisions, can be determined cn reasonable notice. .Provisions of the other kind are ( however, not subject to this presumption..presumption. The point in the case of the Muscat treaties is in fact very similar to that on which the Law Officers of the o r cwn advised in an Opinion given on ^ay 23th, 1909 in regard to the \nglo-Venezuelan treaty of 1854. In that opinion the Law Officers, although admitting that the point was not clear, expressed the viev; that treaties of a commercial nature, which contain no express provisions governing termination, could nevertherless he aetermined upon reasonable notice. In the case of the Muscat -‘■reaties, the issue would he somewhat complicated , since the question might arise v/hether, if some of the provisions of the treaties are clearly not of a commercial hut of a permanent character, the treaties must stand or fall as a whole, or whether it would he possible to denounce some of their provisions only. On the whole, however, if the matter is considered on the oasis of strict law, it seems likely thfct the Muscat 3tate could, upon giving reasonable notice, denounce these treaties with France and the United States, or at least the provisions in them which are of a commercial nature. It appears douotful whether, as the Government of India suggest, the matter turns on the clausula 'rebus sic stantibus'. At any rate if it were decided to endeavour to denounce the treaties, the arguments,.out above would probably be stronger than those founded on the clausula 'rebus sic stantibus'. 4. While the preceding parag±$&gt;hs deal with the position from the strictly legal point of view, 1 am to add that Sir John Sim^n considers from the .V political standpoint any attempt to denounce these treaties on behalf of the Muscat State would be5 '■ ft J * n u4 , c&lt;rb 44 tub fc &lt;-e&lt;\ v/ould be likely to give rise to difficulties with the French and United States Governments in view of the correspondence which has already passed between Kis Majesty's Government and those Govern- -ments regarding the proposed modification of cer- -tain clauses of these treaties by negotiation, 5. Moreover, His Majesty's Government would find themselves in a somewhat invidious position vis-a-vis the French Government, if the Sultan, acting under the advice of His Majesty's Government, denounced the French treaty as a whole, thus abolish- -ii^the quasi-capitulatcry privileges accorded there- -in, while agreeing to the retention by His ^ajest^s Government of the similar privileges granted to this country under the commercial treaty with Muscat of 1391. 6 . A further consideration should not in Sir John Simon’s opinion be overlooked. It is true that the Sultan of Muscat in his conversation with the Political -resident in the Persian Gulf recorded in paragraph 5 of the latter's despatch No.215-3 of 7th April to the Government of India { a copy of which was enclosed in your letter Mo.P.3.2347/32 of 20th April) , acknowledged that nis Majesty's Government had a moral right to expect special treatment from the Muscat ^tate. None the less, it appears not improbable that the abolition of the quasi-capitula tory rights accorded to France would sooner or later lead the Muscat tate to aim at the abolition of the similar privelegBs enjoyed in Muscat by this’ country. 7. In all the circumstances, Sir John Simon suggests, for the consideration of Sir Samuel Hoare, that the Sultan should be given no encouragement to f} the unilateral denunciation either of the whole oron|y of Muscat’s treaties with foreign I am Sir, Your obedient servant, sd/- G.tf.Rendel.e OsHjj^^efere 1932.

Sir, reply to Sir E.Howell’s letter of 11 th Hay, No.D.1673-N/32, I am directed hy the Secretary of State to say the he agrees with the Government of India in their general acceptance of Sir Pugh Biscoe # s views as set out in his letter of 7th April, No.215-S, in regard to the policy to he pursued in future deal ings with the Muscat State. 2 . The Secretary of State sympathises with the desire of the Sultan of Muscat, as recorded in para graph 5 of Sir ^ugh Siscoe’s despatch of 7th April, to he at liberty to modify or to determine the treaties of 1833 and 1844 with the Government of the United states and the French Government respectively. Those treaties were concluded in circumstances very differ- -ent from those which prevail at the present day and the attitude of the new ruler in regard to them is understandable. In the light of the observations in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Government of India's letter under reply, enquiries were accordingly made of the Foreign office as to the possibility of denun- -ciation or modification. The observations of the Secretary of ^tate for foreign Affairs are contained in Foreign Office letter of the 19th ^uly, No.E.3243/ /4/91, of which copies were sent to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by the mail of 21 st July. It will be seen that while,.. he Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign &amp; Politicalwhile, in Sir John Simon’s opinion, it seems likely that on the basis of strict law the Muscat ^tate could upon giving reasonable notice, denounce its treaties with France and the United States, or at least the provisions in them which are of a commercial nature, the political objections to any such actions on its part are substantial. The Grovernment of 1 ndia, in their letter under reply had already expressed their apprehension that the denunciation of the treaties would in^evitably be attributed to the influence of Kis Majesty’s Government and not to the spontaneous policy of the Sultan of Muscat, that it would be regarded as almost an un.- -ffiendly act and would certainly cause resentment out of all proportion to the advantage to be gained. J -he Secretary of ^tate is in agreement with these views, which, as will be seen, are in accord with the conclusions of the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, and the position being as it is he is forced to the conclusion, though with much regret, that no advance is possible in this matter at present (save of course, to the extent to which provisionsi«L the treaties may be modified by negotiation and mutual consent), and that the Sultan should be given no encouragement to contemplate unilateral denunciation either of the whole or of the commercial clauses only of the Muscat treaties with France and the United States. 3.

I am now to enclose drafts of the communica- -tions which suhject to Sir John Simon's concur- -rence might, it is suggested, he addressed to Kis Highness the Sultan of Muscat hy the Political Hesi- -dent in the Persian Gulf on hehalf of his Majesty*s Government and the French Government. The latter draft will, of course, he suhjeCo to the concurrence of the French authorities, which will no douht he sought through His Majesty's representative in Paris. 3 . On a minor A a''ising out of the wording of the draft British note, i am to say that the letter of the 9 th March, 1S30 received from the Sultan of Mus- -cat, requesting a modification of the limitations on his fiscal freedom, referred to the Treaty with His Majesty's Government of 1939. That Treaty was in fact, abrogated and replaced hy the Commercial freaty of 1891, and the limitation of the Sultan's freedom to impose a tariff in excess of 5% ad .valorem in the case of British goods is at present governed hv A-rti nl ft 6 of 1 thft Trftatv nf 1891.In view of this, paragraph 1 of the draft letter makes no referrence to the date of the treaty of 3 Commerce. . hut paragraph makes it clear that the •JrBeaty nt in question is the $r^aty of 1891. 4.

In the India Office letter of the 25th May, P.Z. 2527/32, the suggestion was made that a communcation should be addressed in due course to the interested Dominion G-overnments (the Commonwealth of Australia and the Union of South Africa have of course withdrawn from the Commercial Treaty of 1891-J in regard to the modi- -fication of the Muscat tariff. I am to suggest that Government now that the French/have agreed in principle to the proposals made to them on behalf of His Majesty's Gov- -ernment in the United Kingdom, a communication of the nature in question might suitably issue. The matter is one of considerable urgency and if no objection is seen I am to suggest that any communications to them might be made by telegraph. 6 .

The Sultan was most grateful for the expression of my opinion with which he was in entire agreement. 4. His Highness informed me that it was not his inten tion, even when the assent to the increased rates of duty was received, to put up the tariff all round. He proposed to gradually raise the duty on certain non-essentials such as intoxicating liquors, tobacco, silks &amp;c as a tentative measure and thereafter to reflect before making further additions to the list of goods to pay enhanced rotes. 1 consider that His Highness* attitude in the matter is excellent and shows considerable wisdom and foresight.

IMMEDIATE. .*1 Dear Jenkins, Would you please refer to Foreign Office letter No. E 1015/1015/91 of 3rd March, a copy of which was sent to the Board of Trade, regarding the proposed increase in the Muscat tariff. You will have seen that the French Government have now agreed to the draft note which we propose to address to the Sultan on their behalf subject to amendment of the passage about alcoholic liquor which was founded on a misinterpretation of their note of 29th September 1931. It is clear from that note and from the French note of 20th February 1933 (copy enclosed with Foreign Office letter under reference) that * boissons titrant 25°* are intended to represent the minimum strength of alcoholic liquor subject to the 25% duty, and it is therefore suggested that the relevant passage in the notes to be presented on behalf of the French Government and of His Majesty’s Governments in the United Kingdom, Canada and Irish Free State, after amendment in the sense desired by the French, should read rt 25gS on tobacco and on alcoholic liquor of 35 or less (not more) degrees under proof**. I understand that Nash of your Industries and Manufactures department, with whom Crombie of this department has discussed the point, agrees that the less degrees under proof the stronger the liquor. 2. We should be grateful if the Board of Trade could confirm this and let us know as soon as possible whether they agree with the alteration of the notes to the Sultan in the sense desired by French Government. I understandthat the Dominions Office are waiting for the views of the Board of Trade before agreeing to the alteration/ G. Jenkins, Esq.,M.C., Board of Trade, S.W.l., 3 ) ^ P#Z#1249/33 FOREIGN OFFICE,S.W.l 3rd March, 1933 E 1015/1015/91 With reference to Foreign Office letter ^o.E*6314/4/91 of the 5th January, regarding the proposed modification of the Muscat treaties, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris enclosing the observations of the French Government on the draft notes to be addressed to the Sultan of Muscat on behalf of His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom and the French Government respecting the proposed increase in the Muscat Tariff* 2. It appears that the figure intended by the French Government as the minuraum strength of dutiable liquor to be imported into Muscat has been wrongly interpreted since its first proposal in their note of the 29th September,1931, (a copy of which was sent to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter No*E*4955/267/91 of the 6 th October, 1931). Sir John Simon sees no objection, so far as this department is concerned, to the emendation of the two draft notes in the sense proposed in the note of the 20th February from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and I am to suggest that, if Sir Samuel Hoare and the Board of Trade (to which department a copy of this letter is fceeng sent) share this view, the draft notes should now be sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for communication to the Sultan of Muscat at an/ early date* 3.

G.a.X.142/33. kly dear Laithwalte I have attain t,one into the question ol the agreeiEent a'oout the proposed increase in^the iaiscat tariff, about which you wrote to iae yesteroay (P.2.1249/33). .Ve were alreaay considering the natter when your letter arrived, since it seaneu to us that the Prench conversion of 25 degrees in their scale into our scale was arithmetically wrong. 25 degrees of the Prenen scale is equivalent in our scale to about 55 uegreea under proof, not 35 as Is stated in the enclosure to the despatch from Paris. I astced Johnstone wuether he had any . eons of checking the accuracy of tne copy, but he tells tie tnat the original of the French reply is in Paris, anu they will have to get the matter looked into there. 1 am sending hiui a copy of tais letter, and on receipt oi it ne will no doubt make the necessary enquiries. 3o far as we are concerned we should accept the wording you suggest, subject to tne substitution of 55 for 35, that is to say - *25?a on tabucco ana on alcoholic liquor of 55 or less degrees under proof.' mi alternative solution would be to substitute a reference to the French scale for the reference to our own scale, and the provision might then be '25S on tobacco and on;, icoholic liquor containing 25^ or more by volume of alcohol.' For political reasons, however, the Foreign Office would no aoubt prefer to stick to our own scale rather Ilian adopt the French scale In a diplomatic document. YOU/ iwaite, 2sq*,You will no doubt have observed that the French ■ proposal will let in their wines at the lower rate of duty and that practically spealcing the only alcoholic liquors which will pay the higher duty are spirits* Since we ourselves make a distinction of the same kind in our auties, I uo not think we could very well object, but in view of the lapse of time I think that anyhow we must accept the position. the Canadian and Irish Free State Governments have accepted the draft note - vriich was obviously wrong in this particular • without any comment, am I should think that it wouia be quit^mneceesary to conault them before uu-klnt, the alteration, though no doubt their attention should be called to it when the final note is conmunlcated to them. Die point is, 1 should think, of no practical importance to them. I cm sending a copy of this letter to Glutterbuck ana Johnstone. Yours, etc. (3d.) T.G. JENKINS.fyur- tiz CONFIDENTIAL.

My dear Oliver, Your dea^tcii J*o.248 (55/3/33) of the 21st February regarding the proposed modification of the Muscat treaties. 2. You will see from the interdepartmental corres pondence enclosed that the French seem to have miscalcula ted the equivalent in our scale of 25 degrees in their scale for assessing the strength of liquor. Also, on our side, there appears to have been some confusion in the use of the terms ’’under' and 'over proof'. 3. tr/e agree with the view expressed in paragraph 3 of Jenkins’ letter to Laithwaite of the 11 th March that we should stick to the English 'scale'. It appears, then, that the bracketed phrase in paragraph 2 of the French and paragraph 3 of the United Kingdom draft note should be amended to read '(25% on tobacco and on alcoholic liquor of 35 or less degrees under proof)'. tfill you explain the matter to the Ministry of Foreigh Affairs and ask them to agree to an amendment in this sense ? 4.

I should explain that the intention from the beginning has been that the Muscat Government should be permitted to levy a higher rate of duty on stronger alcoholic ■ liquor, the strength above which the higher duty should be leviable being alcoholic liquor of 25 or more degrees measured on the metric scale. This was erroneously express ed in my confidential despatch N 0 .I 82 of the 2 nd September last and in the draft note of which a copy was enclosed therein as '25 or more degrees under proof', and t he error has only recently been discovered. It is proposed that the strength of alcoholic liquor on which the higher duty should be leviable should be expressed in the nomenclature of this country whereby the equivalent of '28 or more degrees' on the metric system is '55 or Xess degrees under proof'.

Sir, With reference to my confidential despatch TJo. 222 of the 5th September, 1931, regarding a proposal that the tariff provisions of the Commercial Treaty with Muscat of 1891, and of similar treaties between Muscat and France, and Muscat and the United States of America, should be revised, I have the honour to state, for the information of His Majesty ’s Oovernment in Pewfoundlami. Your Ministers, that the French fovernnent consented to a modification of their Treaty rights on the lines indicated in my despatch under reference, subject to the concurrence of the United States Government in a similar modification of their rights. Negotiations, however, with the United States Government provea unsuccessful, since they would only consent to a modi ioat ion their Treaty rights on terms which were unacceptable the Muscat Government. Since, however, the situation of Muscat still rendered an increase m the Customs duties Imperative, some other mfthod became requisite in order to attain the end de. ired. 2. After consultation with the French Government it was decided that a note should be addressee to the Muscat Government to the effect that, despite .r, i- ^ 6f the Treaty of 1891, which Treaty will remain in force, no objection will be raised on behalf of dis Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and of the Uovernraent of India D an increase in the Customs duties to 10$ (&lt;$,£ on tobacco and on alcoholic liquor of 55 or less degrees under proof). Me acquiescence, however, is subject to the understanding (a) that a similar increase applies to ships of all other nations except those of the United States (which, as stated in the enclosure to my despatch under reference, are protected by Treaty) and of the Netherlands (which enjoy most-favoured nation treatment); (b) that if any ships so protected exploit their Treaty advantage, the right is reserved of immediately withdrawing this acquiescence. Since no United Mates vessels participate in the Muscat trade, and there is no prospect that any will do so, no exploitation is expected from United States vessels, and His Majesty's Uovernment in the United Kingdom are satisfied that none will come from itherlands vessels, 3. The French Government were willing that a note in .milar terms, and subject to a similar understanding, should i addressed to the Muscat Government on their behalf by the jcal British Representative, and His Majesty's Governments in anada and the Irish Free S tate also agreed to similer notej eing addressed to the Sultan on their behalf, nstructions have therefore recently been ^ent ajesty's Representative at Muscat to proceed to address such otes to the bultan. .

The order was hurriedly published in Muscat on the eve of the arrival of the mail steamer, and although published on the 30th April in Gwadur was given effect to from the 29th April in order again to catch an incoming mail. 3. x consider that His Highness has shown a consideracle lack of discretion in publishing the order without any prior warning to the public and, in view of the efforts of H.M's Government to obtain for him the con 1 currence of other2 @ ® &gt;7- Treaty Powers to an increase in the tariff, it would have been an act of becoming courtesy on the part of His High ness had he intimated his intentions beforehand to me, as the local representative of Government• At a recent interview with the Sultan I politely but finnly indicated my views to His Highness, who ex pressed his regrets* He at the same time stated that in publishing the order thus suddenly and un-announced it had not been his intention to in any way ignore or slight the Government, through whose assistance he had obtained these prigileges* 5 . Finally I would observe that this increase in duties practically affects only luxuries and no essential £ commodities. It is applicable both to Gwadur and the Batinah ports but not to Bur. In actual practice, due to the nature of the imports, specified, it will only affect the ports of Muscat, Matrah and Gwadur.

I asked His Highness whether the new tariff affected only the ports of Muscat, Muttra and Gwadur, or the whole of his territory.

You will see that His Highness has apparently misunderstood the phrase *55 or less degrees under proof* and that except in his reply to the French Note he speaks of *alcoholic wines which are found to contain 55 per cent, or less alcohol* which, of course, means the reverse of wiat is interned. Subject to the concurrence of the other interested Departments, we propose simply to write to the Resident drawing attention to the mistake ana saying that we assume this is merely a verbal error; that in practice the £5% duty will only be collected on the more powerful sorts of alcoholic liquor (viz. alcoholic liquor of *55 or less degrees under proof*) and that on this assumption we see no need, unless he thinks there would be advantage in doing so, in asking the Sultan for an amended letter, trie position being in our view sufficiently safeguarded in the Notes addressed to the Sultan. The French, to whom the Foreign Office have, I think, promised a copy of the sultan’s reply, are the only people who are really interested in the matter and, by a fortunate chance the Sultan’s mistake aoes not appear in his reply to the French Note.

For obvious reasons| however, the technical pnrase “unaei* proof' has no equivalent in any kohamiriedan language • 1 suggest therefore that the extracts enclosed should he submitted for examination to an Arabic scholar, in the School of Oriental Studies for instance, and I would be grateful for a brief telegram intimating whether the phrase has been correctly rendered into Arabic# Xhe word 'correct' would be sufficient* 3 # The error has, however, served one useful purpose in that it has suggested a douot as to whether the egression ; '66 degrees or less under proof' has been understood oy His i j Highness the Sultan. On receipt of your telegram referred to in the preceding paragraph, if it transpires taat our translation is correct, I shall ask the political Agent, i/uscat, to ascertain discreetly whether ;he ulx on liquor is being correctly inposed, and if not, to explain to ids Highness the mesnin* of the phrase '65 degrees unuer proof'. It is desirable that this point be made cleat- as too., as possible. If on the other hand, our translation turns out to be incorrect, then amended notes will have to be substituted for those already exchanged. I am sending a copy of this letter, and of your express better referred to, to the Government of India. I have the honour to be, Sir i Your most obedient servant, sd. T. C.

Sir, In reply to your letter of the 25th June, No. 581-3* on the subject of the Muscat Tariff, I am directed by the Secretary of otate to enclObS for your information copy of the correspondence noted in the margin with the Foreign Office regarding the correct translation into Arabic of the phrase 'under proof'• it will be seen that the Arabic version ox this phrase enclosed in your letter under reply does not appear to convey the meaning intended. Oi- the alternatives which have been suggested by the Foreign Office in their note which is now enclosed, (a) is not technically correct, and after informal discussion w' Colonel Fowle the Secretary of State considers that the test course would be that the political Agent should be instructed to secure the sultan's consent to the use formula (h) in the Foreign Office memorandum and to give His Highness at the same time an explanation of what is involved, in the terms of the letter to the Foreign Office of 20th July now enclosed.

The Secretary of State understands from Colonel Fowle that the Political Agent has not yet approached His Highness with a view to securing the amended Notes in respect of the United Kingdom, Canada and the Irish Free state referred to in the express letter from the India Office of 25th Lay, P.Z.3257/34, and I am to request that when this matter is raised with the Sultan the opportunity may oe taken to secure a revised version of the reply addressed by His Highness to the French Government, whicn will meet the point raised in Foreign Office letter of 13th July. It would be convenient if the revised Notes could be secured at an early date. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant,e- INDIA OPPIGS, •HII^iiALL, 3. i. !• 2Qtb July 1934. t1 H P I write with reference to our telephone conversation to say that I hope you will for&amp;ive n.e lor bothering you with a snail and trouble eouie but rather urgent point which has arisen in connection with a Modification whicn is being ruaue in the iuscat tariff. I need not trouble you with the whole story which is extremely involved, but you will see from the 25 thencloseu copy of a letter from tne Political Sesldent in 1934 the Persian Gulf that our difficulty is the translation into Arabic of toe Angllsh technical pnrase 'under proof as used of alcoholic liquor. Briefly the position is that uuty is to be collected at a higher rate (25%) than the normal on tobacco and on the more powerful forms of S alcoholic liquor, viz* “alcoholic liquor of o5 ox* degrees unaer proof*, hut that in order to give preferential treatment to French wines, liquors oi less alcoholic/ irianaer A.a.

We anouiu be most grateful if you eoula check for us the Arabic versions of the phrase 'bb or less uegrees under proof* which are given in the enclosure to the iiesiuonVs letter. It seems to us that the Sultan at any rate is under the mistakexi impression tnat uie phrase 'under proof* meais “when put to the proof* or * tested*, whereas, of course, die phrase is usea of the amount by which the strength of any given spirit falls short of 'proof spirit*, which means, I understand, spirit containing roughly oy volume oi pure alcohol at 60° Fahrenheit. If the Arabic versions in the enclosure to the tfesiaent’s letter are in ract incorrect, could you possibly suggest a better .&lt;*rabic rendering of the phrase in question* 1/- 3 - L I fear the problem is far from easy! but we shall be most grateful for aqy help you cm give us.

Muscat f 22nd October 1934. © To His Highness ^aiyid Haid bin laimur, Sultan of muscat &amp; Oman. Your Highness, I have the honour to state that 1 am directed by the Hon'ble the rolitical ^sident to refer to Your Highness’s replies to his letters Nos. 220, 221, 222 and 223 dated 19th June 1933 concerning the revision of the Muscat Tariff rates in so far as th€ they concern the duty on alcoholic beverages. it would appear irom Your Highness's replies for the respective Governments of the united Kingdom, Canada, the Irish *ree State and i'ranee that the term 'under proof' has not been clearly understood. j|J _ The term 'under proof” is o. used of the amount by which the strength of any given spirit fails short of 'proof spirit'. 'Proof spirit' contains 57 * by volume of pure alcohol. Thus the less number of degrees the spirit is 'under proof' the stronger the liquor becomes. The mo re it is 'under proof' the weaker the strength of the liquor. your Highness replies to the various letters above referred to state ('and twenty five per centon tabacco and alcoholic wines which are found to contain 55% or HIM alcohol” ) # This is the point which appears to have been misunderstood. 5. Liquors which are n less I! than 55% under proof” are liquors which contain MOKE than 55% alcohol and it is only on liquors of these strengths i.e. 55% and less 'under proof' that the various Government named have assented to the increased Customs dues. Liquors of weaker strengths will still come under the old rates. 6# x have therefore been directed by the hon*ble the political Resident to request *our highness to be 80 good as to issue amended replies for the four dovernments concerned and thus to clear any chance of error in the future, as it is practically impossible to adequately translate into arable the term 'unaer proof' I would suggest to your highness that these very words be || employed in the Arabic texts of the notes. The words might be followed by the explanation 'i.e. 55* under proof or of GREATKR alcoholic strength'. I 4|| trust your highness will see no objection to this suggestion which would | definitely make the situation quite clear. should your highness agree tl the foregoing then it would be highly | appreciated if special mention of this point may be made in your note for communication to the French Cover, anentmention was made of the fact and it is one to which the French Government attach** great importance. I trust that i our highness 8 . will concur with the request of His Majesty’s Government as conveyed to me tnrough the -^on’ble the Political Resident and, as they desire an early reply, X sun directed to request that Your Highness will be good enough, should you agree to these points, to favour me with revised notes be!ore your impending departure for India. with the expression of my warmest regards towards Your Highness I am Your Highness’s sincere friend.

Would you please refer to Bushire express letter Uo.344-S of 29th April, 1935, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Political Agent of Muscat, together with translations of four Notes dated 10th March, 1935, from the Sultan of Muscat to Bremner on the subject of the ion. Muscat tariff. 2. The second paragraph of each of the Sultan's Notes gives an admirable description of the working of the 'under proof' scale, but the statement at the beginning of paragraph 3 of the ^iotes to the effect that 'liquors which are less than 55 degrees 'under prooi are liquors which contain more than 5o per cent .alcohol ' is wrong. It is merely a matter of aritlanetio. 'Prooi' means 'containing 57$ tiy volume of pure alcohol . '55 degrees under proof' means containing 45/100 of 57 per cent, viz. about 25 per cent , of pure alcohol. (You will notice that this figure is given in paragraph 3 of the Board of Trade's demi-official letter of 11th ‘-arch, 1933 copy/ 'Col.p.G.Loch, C.I.E. d.B.M.Consul-General, Bushire.d 19th y 1935. copy sent to Bushire Toy air mail on 17th March, 1933, P.Z. 1448/33). Similarly 40 degrees under proof means containing 60/100 of 57 per cent, viz. about 34 per cent, of pure alcohol, and so on. ’'Containing 5c per cent of pure alcohol”, the figure given by the Sultan, means about 4 degrees under proof i 3. You will see, however, from the enclosed copy of a demi-official letter from the Foreign Office that the latter have decided that the Sultan s latent i.otes can be accepted as satisfactory in view of the fairly clear statement towards the end of the third paragraph that it is 'on liquors of these strengths, i.e. 55 degrees and less 'under proof that the increased duty will oe charged and liquors of weaker strength will . „ T&gt;lis statement should be quite under the old rates. 1 + n thp French Government who, as yod raay satisfactory to the ^reno- remember, are anxious to ensure that the ni.ner rat duty will not be charged on light wines,etc. Indeed, ij onffer if the Sultan were the only party who would sufl vrlffher rate only on liquors actually to charge the high nf -Dure alcohol, would containing more than 55 per c ^ lf vut we trust that the Political be the Sultan himself, bu.

In these circumstances we should be glad if you could now obtain for us, as soon as possible, the original correspondence and the certified copies of the Motes exchanged with the Sultan which are specified in paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office letter in order that the Foreign Office and the Dominions Office may be in a position to complete the necessary formalities with the Governments of France, Canada and the Free State at an early date. • -p +&gt;11 &lt;3 letter to Ache son 5.

The fresh notes from the Sultan which formed the enclosure to your letter under reference have been carefully examined here. Although, at first sight, they looked unpromising we have reached the conclusion that they can be accepted in view of the fairly clear statement in their last paragraphs that it is M on liquors of these strengths, o i.e. 55 and less ’under proof* that the increased duty will be charged and liquors of weaker strength will still cu :e under the old rates”. 3. The only reason of importance for asking for the amended notes • at least the only reason of importance apart from our natural desire to see replies in e better form - was to ensure that the higher rate of dut^ ; would not be charged on light wines etc. whose alcoholic 0 strengths range a good deal below 55 under proof. Tuat point is now made clear. it io true that ine - -'--■i clings to his '55$' idea but if he charges the higher rate only on liquors containing more than 55?5 pure alcohol it will not be the importers who will complain, and I think we can leave it to the Gulf authorities to see that the Sultan does not impoverish himseli by doin^ so. •Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E. 4.4 .

If wnat tne Sultan means is tnat so far as tne resent notes are concerned de is free to cnarge any duty e liaes on goons arriving in non-Frencn vessels ( United tates and Dutcn excepted), provided tne cnarges are 10i_°r 1 ore, tnat is probably true (subject to treaty rights of tner countries) and possibly unobjectionaDle for the Frencn). 4 ./ I.J.Clauson, Lsq.If however he means tnat unless ana until goods begin to arrive at Muscat in Frencn vessels, the notes do not ta^e effect at all and that he can cnarge what duty he likes - even less tuan 1021 - on goods arriving in other vessels (United Statea ana Dutcn excepted) that appears to be a more aubious proposition. 5. Woula you then explain our difficulty to the Political Resident and asm nim to try to obtain some eluciaation from the Sultan when in aue course he returns to affairs of State. It woula of course be preferable if tae Sultan coulu be again approacned ana induced to reply in tne terms of the draft note previously prepared, witn, if needs be, the auuition of a sentence embodying nis intended reservation in more precise terms. S. Incidentally we shall require a certified copy of tne Arabic text of tne Sultan's final reply for eventua transmission witn a translation to the Frencn Government. Yours sincerely, T. V* Brenan.

After Compliments, I thank you for your letter No.43-S, dated the 7th January 1937 in which you informed me that our friend the Govern ment of the French Republic wrote to our friend the Hritish Government about the matters quoted in our letter addressed to you on the 17th Dhil Qa’ada on the subject of the increase of Customs duty on goods imported by French vessels into M u scato It appears to me that the Government of the French Republic desire to draw our attention in particular to the fact that the reservations referred to in (a) and (b) in the second paragraph of your letter dated the I9th ^une 1933 were not reproduced in our reply. In these circumstances I shall be glad if, with a view to remove all possible doubts on the subject, our friend the British Government will be so good as to inform the Govern' ment of the French Hepublic that our reply to your letter dated the 19th u u ne 1933 should be interpreted so as to give this ren dering, that is to says we understand and agree that the concu rrence of the Government of the French Republic in the increase of Customs duty to 10* on goods imported by French vessels into Muscat, (25* on tobacco and alcoholic liquor of 55 degrees or less under proof) despite the provisions in Article 10 of the Treaty concluded in 1844 which still remains in force, I state that I understand and agree that the concurrence of the Govern ment of the F r ench Republic to what has been mentioned above is subject to (firstly) that a similar increase shall apply to the commodities imported by the vessels of other nations except vessels of the Uni'ec^thich are protected by the existing Treaty and vessels of the Dutch Government which enjoy simple most - favoured nation treatment (secondly) that if the Government of the French/-of ttic i.'rench ^public find tnat oome of tne ahipa go pro tected by the existing Treaty exploit their Treaty advantage to the detriment of French Trade or shipping the right of withdrawing the acquiescence iumeai&amp;tely, from paying the extra Custom uuty f is reserved by the Gcverrcfcnt of the drench Hepublic* Usual ^naing* Certified true translation.

Sir, With his despatch No. 1?58 (1062/5/35) of the 19th December, 1935* Sir George Clerk: transmitted a copy of a note from the French Ministry of Foreign affairs in which the Ministry aslced that a more clearly worded reply might be obtained from the Sultan of Muscat in answer to His Majesty’s Government’s note of the 16 th June, 1&gt;33i concerning the modification of the Muscat Tariff. 2. The draft supplementary notes which His Majesty’s Government proposed to instruct the 1 olitical Resident in the Persian Gulf to arrange to exchange with the dultan of Muscat were sent to iir George Clerk: under cover of Mr. Aden’s despatch No. 731 of the 21st April, 1936, for the approval of the French Government, and, subsequently, Sir George Clerk with his despatch No. 61? (541 A/36) of the 9 th May transmitted a copy of a note from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs concurring in the proposed texts. 3 . It has not been possible, until quite recently, to obtain the necessary letter from the Sultan of Muscat, but I now enclose, for transmission to the French Government, a certified copy of the Arabic original of a letter addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by the Sultan together with a certified copy of an English translation. A copy of this translation is also enclosed for retention in His Majesty’s Embassy. 4 . The delay which has occurred lias been occasioned by the fact that an earlier letter, written in 1937, in which the dultan attempted to meet the French Government's wishes, did not/ enev The Right Honourable ^ ir ^ric Phipps* G.C. tf.G. ,not brin:^ and it was prolonged caused fui 5. should be inserting re servatic reservati( which eon&lt; Government does, in 3 as enjoyii reservati&lt; this is d\ wishes of difficult; 6 . : have been eqaivalen - Governmen' theraselvei point by 1 Muscat*f not bring out the exact points which they required to be made, &lt;-.ui it was necessary to obtain an aznended version; the prolonged aosences or the Sultan from his capital have also caused further delays. 5* With regard to the letter herewith transmitted it should be observed that it still contains one defect. By inserting the words 'by the existing Treaty” in the second reservation the Sultan has made it appear as if the second reservation applied only to that part of the first reservation which concerns United states vessels, since the Netherlands Government, although their 'most-favoured-nation” treatment does, in fact, derive from a Treaty right, are not mentioned as enjoying a Treaty right in the wording of the first reservation. It seems unnecessary, however, to suppose that this is due to any desire on the Sultan’s part to evade the wishes of the French Government rather than to his known difficulty in dealing with this rather complicated question. 6. It will be noticed that the English words 'under proof have been employed in the Sultan’s letter. There is no real equivalent for this technical phrase in Arabic, and the French government in their note of the 18th December, 1935, declared themselves satisfied with the explanation furnished on this point by the letter of the 10th March, 1935, from the Sultan of Muscat.

The correspondence is primarily concerned with the Sultanate's customs tariffs. It features extensive discussion between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and officials of the India Office, Foreign Office, Dominions Office, Government of India, and the Board of Trade on the following related matters: Muscat's existing treaties with the United States and France (dated 1833 and 1844 respectively), and the advisability of these treaties – or at least their commercial clauses – being modified or denounced by the Sultan; the case for increasing customs import duties on certain goods (e.g. tobacco and alcohol), in an effort to increase revenue and restore the stability of the Sultanate's finances, and the likely effects that such an action would have on trade; the threshold (based on alcoholic content) to be used for identifying which alcoholic drinks should be subject to the proposed customs duty increase for alcohol, and the difficulty in translating the technical phrase 'under proof' into Arabic; the efforts of the British Government to secure the agreements of the Sultanate's other treaty partners (namely Canada, the Irish Free State, and France) regarding the proposed customs duty increase.The French language material consists of letters from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British representative in Paris. The Arabic language material mainly consists of letters between British representatives and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, most of which include English translations.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>France, Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Dominions Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sultanate of Muscat and Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000385#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
