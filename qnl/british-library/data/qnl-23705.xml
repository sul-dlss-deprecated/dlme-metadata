I fully realize that the currency is Indian and is a foreign one in Bahrain and only approach you to enquire as to whether you can offer or obtain any advice on the subject.

Sir, I ha 0 the honour to say that a great many complaints have recently been received in Bahrain regarding had coinage which is in circulation, ihe currency here being Indian it is obviously impossible for the Bahrain Grovemment to move in the matter and the Eastern Bank beyond refusing to accept bad coins are also unable to act. ihe ilgency,however, though not a ireasury,performs most of the functions of one and I would be glad to know whether the olitidal Agent in his magisterial or any other capacity could cut and return bad coins offered so as to restrict their circulation and make merchants more careful. There is little doubt that at the moment bad coins are brought in from 'Ira in large quantities. I have the honour to be Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant, Political /igent,no: rs' or 1331. Britliih.

I would be glad if the Indian Coinage Act could be extended to Bahrain as earlj as possible so that steps ma/ be taken to combat the rery large number of defective, counterfeit,defaced and diminished coins now current in Bahrain. Apparently in the last lew weeks an exceptional number of these coins have maae their appearence here, possibly owing to the rupee having ceased to be legal tender in T Iraq,ana the Bahrain Government have asiied for steps to be taken to legalise the destruction of such coins. 3. I have enquired from the Eastern Bank whether they would be prepared to undertake the duty of cancelling these coins and the Manager of their local branch has applied to his Head Office for sanction. I understand that they are unwilling to do it,since they consider a special man would have to be engaged for the purpose ana they also Tear that it might make persons unwilling to deal with them. 4. It is requested tiiat authority,when obtained,may be to cut not only counterfeit,but also defective,Giminished and defaced coins. I have hitherto been unable to secure a copy of the Indian Coinage Act and I am,therefore,ignorant of its provisions. ^ ' t . Political .Agent, Bahrain.— C's. P.

You will remember we discussed the matter during my present visit to Bahrain. Personally I am of opin- - ion that - on general principles • the fewer regulations that Bahrain is inflicted with the better. In tne present instance the main object of the proposal appears to be to restrict the circulation of bad coins and to educate the public to be more careful. The Bank already refuses bad coins. If the Agency, all Departments of the State and leading firms ( who might be circularised by the Agency o^ the Bahrain Government ), uo tne same, and do it ?/ith some publicity, this object will pyj.m^ facie be achieved without the necessity of introducing fresh legislation.

In a case that I have just seen here, it appears that we have not even allowed / 'but encouraged^urbars to join in protecting currency and also have some arrangements with them for exchanging deficient coinage. The case seems to be governed generally by Notification No. 1448-A dated the 8th March 1907 which was published in exercise of the power conferred by Section 16 of the Indian Coinage Act 1906 (No. 3 of 1906)o 2. It seems to me that these terms are somewhat more advantageous than those which were mentioned when you replied to my application, and since I believe the matter was not referred here before a reply was give^I think you might care to look up the case and see whether you had full information at your disposal in replying. 3. The Eastern Bank is not one of the banks mentioned tt* in schedule referred to in paragraph 2(2) of the Notifica- A tion, but you will see that any officer in charge of k-he-^ sub-treasury can act of diminished and defaced silver coins. It appears that coinage can be withdrawn from circulation and its value refunded . I do not remember that I had noticed this ydoin^when I dealt with the case and in view of the appalling tide o^feounterfeit and \ py *Foreign and Political Department, The J93 . and short-weight coins sent down from Iraq to Bahrain on the closure oyihat country to rupee currency I think this might help in clearing matters up. There will he little difficulty in authorising the Eastern Bank to act under this notification, if you wished it, 'because I see that we extended this power to the Baroda Bank under similar circumstances. &gt; •rl —-S, fin ' 6th August 1935 , At 12.30 hours I accompanied Mr.Belgrave to the Bank House and discussed the matter with i^r.Ham. 2. The latter said that he was getting 30^ of his perfectly good coins refused by payees 1 , 3. The only test was ♦ringing* by throwing on to the ground from full arras length and with great force. 4. Mr.Ham thought that the prohibition of 1 ringing* might do some good,but then the Bank would have to ^ing 1 - in the proper and gentle manner - or they ! d be swamped with bad coins. 5. kr.Ham thought certain anti-Bank factors might be encouraging this loss of confidence and he indicated his intention of going round bazaars to try and find out what was happening. 6. Mr.Selgrave and I agreed that there must be some person whose v/ord would be accepted in cases of doubt. 7. The Bank Cashier was a good Shroff but had no such standing. He was liable to intense irritation at refusals . of his good coins. 8. It was not seen how the prohibition of ringing - as done at Kuwait - would help matters (vide Para 4 above). 9. We could not think of any solution as each suggestion could so easily be turned about in the minds of the locals and give a most dpjnaging result. y/Political Agency, Bahrain,the 9th August 1953.

Each rupee which gives sound is accepted and that v/hich gives no sound is returned to its owner. The people of Dibai and Sharjah had to experience great hardships on account of this. Shaikh of Dibai held a meeting composed of merchants to discuss the question of rupees. He asked the merchants to eaplain to him as to why they were not accepting rupees unless they are beaten on stones. The merchants replied that amongst the rupees there are many Uebased coins which can not be accepted. Thereupon the Shaikh asked them to let him know v who coins rupees at Dibai or at Sharjah. They said that they do not know. Then Shaikh of Dibai made proper investigations and came to know that some Persians at BURAIMI coin rupees. He (Shaikh of Dibai)wrote to Shaikh of Buraimi about the matter and the reply has not come so far. 3. * Shaikh of Dibai and Shaikh of Sharjah both agreed to the prohibition of beating rupees on stones. They posted Aalans to this effect in the bazars. Nowadays beating of rupees has ceased but if the rupees are found to be not coined by the British Government they are handed over to Shaikh of Dibai and Shaikh of Sharjah. 4.

The Shaikh of Baraimi is on good terms with the Shaikhs of Trucail Oman Coast. 4. Shaikh of Dibai wrote to Shaikh of Baraimi in a friendly way that some Persians coin money which is not proper and that those who do so should be prevented. That if he does not take any step to stamp out this action, anybody who is seen to import such coins in Dibai will be arrested and severely punished. Shaikh of Dibai is still awaiting the reply.

I have the honour to invite a/reference to the corres pondence resting ^ith my letter No. D.6556-F, dated the 28th October 1939, regarding Withdrawal of Victoria silver coin*. From the statistics available it appears that there is a marked difference in the amounts of doubtful Victoria Silver coin remitted to the Calcutta and Bombay Mints from the various parts i of India, which is probably due in part at least to the greater reluctance of certain officers in charge of Treasuries and sub-Treasuries to exercise their discretion in the matter. I am, therefore, to request that, if the Provincial Crovernment see no objection, the attention of all Treasury and Sub-Treasury Officers may be drawn to the existing instructions and they may be asked to exercise freely their discretion to accept doubtful Victoria rupees, half rupees and quarter rupees at their full face value.

Dear JUjfff CUiw, VICTORIA RUPEES Reference our No.DO/CAU.1/2288 of 3rd February 1941. You may remember that some time ago I mentioned to you that it might be desirable for us to advise the Shaikh of Qatar to return all his Victoria rupees to the Bank. You subsequently telephoned to us that you would men tion this matter to the Shaikh on your visit and that, meantime, we should take no action. So far, the Shaikh has not returned us any Victoria rupees, and we suggest you may now consider it an appropriate time for us to open the subject with the Shaikh who will expect us to handle his transactions with the Bank on his behalf. Victoria rupees and half rupees, according to the Bank circular dated 23rd January 1941, cease to be legal tender in India after 31st March 1941. You have a copy of this circular. 7 /e are presuming that the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, are prepared to receive Victoria rupees and half rupees up to the 30th September 1941 at least, but the wording of the circular gives nothing on this important point.

Silver coins should not therefore be exsanined in future for light weights ? but care must be taken as usual to see that counterfeit coins or coins bearing obvious signs of fraudulent defacement are not accepted. Light weignt rupee eliminated at Treasuries will be accepted by the Mint Masters at their full face value. Light weight rupees received at the Treasuries etc., should on no account be reissued but should be held in the chests and remitted to the Mint as a currency remittance from time to time. 4. We shall be glad if you will kindly issue instructions to all the Treasury Officdrs, Sub-Treasury Officers and Agents of the branches of the Imperial Bank of India in your jurisdiction on the lines indicated in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.

Subject:- Hints on detecting George 71 counterfeits of 1940 and onwards with securii.7 edge. We forward herewith for jour information a copy of the memorandum containing H Hints on detecting George VI counter feits of 1940 and onwards With security ede» ,, issued by the Master of the Mint, Bombay. ^ J 2. Paragraphs 5,7,9 ,16 and 18 of the memorandum deal specifically with coins wit h secu rity edge and may be in corporated in the appendix ( w Bints on detecting counterfeit^ coins M ) to your Treasury Rules. Pending their incorporation in the Treasury Rules, these instructions may be circulated to all the Treasuries and Sub-treasuries in your province in the form of executive instructions. Hints on Detecting George 71 counterfeits of 1940 and onwards, with security edge. Two kinds of counterfeits are found, cast and struck, or a combination of the two. 2. CJast counterfeits are the most easily made, and therefore more usually found. The mould into which the molten metal is poured, may be made of sand, clay t nowdered burnt brick, plaster^of Paris or similar material, and the impression on the mould is taken from the genuine coin. The mould has a small hole or 'g^te' cut in the rim. through which the molten me4al is puured. The metal which fills the nole, and solidifiei with the rest of the casting, forms a projection on the rim of the cast coin, which must be cut off to enable the rim at this point to be finished and milled by the hand, and the security groove put in. Signs of this hand finishing can usually be aetectea on the rim of cast counterfeits. ?. Struck counterfeits are made by striking or pressing blanks between dies of hard metal, the designs of which are engraved by hand, or from dies of softer metal on which the impressions can be transferred from a genuine coin. The blanks thus struck, may have been first cast or cmt from sheet metal. 4. Counterfeits are more easily detected if compared with one or more genuine coins of the same design, using a magnify- inS.Slf' 38 if necessary. A suspicious coin may also be weighed qgamst a genuine coin showing the same amount of wear, sine© most counterfeits which do not contain much lead are lighter than genuine coins. 5. '^ftien rung on a hard surface, genuine coins should give aclear sound. Counterfeits, as a rule, do not produce a clear ring if made of base metal. Others may contain more silver than the genuine coin which contains 50% silver, and in this case the ring* may be clear, but will give a lower tone than the genuine alloy.12/ This however, is not a conclusive test, as counterfeits occasionally ring Y »ell, while genuine coins*are sometimes •dumb 1 owing to small cracks or flaws in the metal. The presence of such cracks f if visible On the edge of the coin would indicate that the com is genuine. 6. The thickness of a genuine coin is uniform while counter feits are sometimes thicker at one side than at the other ®nd are often slightly bent or distorted, so that they will not lie evenly between two other coins. 7. The rim of genuine Rupees, half-rupees and quarter .rupees are regularly milled all round with straight indentations at right angles to the faces, but rupees of 1940 and onwards, and half rupees of 1941 onwaras have also a security device in the centre of the milled edge. This device consists of a shallow grove containing alternate beads and diagonal lines, in two sections, separated by blank spaceso TheoLank portions on rupees of 1940 are about twice the Ifen^th of those on rupees or half rupees bearing the date 1941. The counterfeits of these coins, the milling is often at a slant, the spaces between the identations irregular, and the indentations tnemselfes uneven or broken. The milling can be best examined by placing the suspected coin between two good coins of the 'same description, when defects can be readily detected. Coins should not be classed as counterfeits solely on account of bad milling, since genuine coins are found with worn milling, with portions soldered for use as ornajnents, or with the edges filled or touched up. Coins of which the milling is good however, are seldom counterfeit, 8. The beadingon the face of the rim of genuine coins should be even and irregular, the pearls being uniform in size and shape, and evenly spaced. The enclosed spaces of letters and figures such as 0. F, A. R, D, 4, 9, 0, in cast counterfeits are sometimes filled with metal. In struck counterfeits the pearli are often spaced at' irregular intervals and are sometimes very small and far apart. 9. The beads and diagonal lines which appear alternately in relief, inside the security groove shoCdd be clear cut well defined, and uniform in size and shape. The blank portions of the groove should be equal in length. In counterfeits, the beads and diagonal lines are often badly shaped and uneven in * size, the intervening spaces being some times' filled with me^alo The olank portions usually' show si^ns of metal having been scooped out by hand, resulting in broken milling on either side of the blank portion, and possibly a wider groove than in genuine coins. 10. The devices on the obverse and reverse should be clear and well defined, especially in outline. Blurned lines or edges and an imperfect impression (unless plainly due to wear and tear) are suspicious. Letters and figures of the inscription should be clear, well defined and roimded. Blurred irregular, or double lines are to be regarded with suspicion. In some cdunterfeits, the letters are much thinner than on genuine coins. 11. The table or plain surface of the coin (i.e. the portion not occupied bv any design or inscription) should be smooth, even and free from blemish. An uneven, spotted or rough surface with r irregular nodes of metal thereon is suspicious.12. All cast coins are counterfeit. In at oast coin the surface is usually rough or pitted with minute holes. The rim is usually detective, particularly at the 'gate' or point where tne metal was poured into the mpuld. 13. In the case of struck counterfeits, it is not unusuaUf to find several with identical marks or defects, having been struck from the same dies. The milling is usually very irfegular. In the case of cast counterfeits, the milling and the design in the groove are often evenly spaced, except at the 'gate' where the surplus metal has been^ removed. 14. Genuine coins which ha«e suffered by the action of chemicals or fine may have rough and discoloured surfaces' though they are generally distinguishable from cast coins. In doubtful cases suspicious coins should be sent to one of the Mints for examination. 15. Counterfeits made from a mixture of tin and lead arc soft and easily bent, tod will sometimes emit a. cracking noise when bent between the fingers while being held close to the ear. 16. Rupees bearing dated 1938 and 1:939 and half-rupees bearing dates 1938, 1939 and 1940 which are found with the security grooved edge are definitely counterfeit. Rupees and half rupees of these issues are regularly millad all round like e arlier issues without a Security edga^ • Similarly rupees of 1940 and onwards and half rupees of 1941 and on ward which are regularly milled all round like the earlier issues are also counterfeit. 17. A counterfeit will usually be found to exhibit at least two or more of the foregoing faults. A coin should not be ordinarily be condemned for only one fault unless it is very marked^ IS. George 71 Bupees of 1938 and 1939, half-rupees of 1938 and 1939 ana quarter rupees of 1939 are made of Standard Silver. Rupees, half-rupees and quarter-rupees of 1940 and onwards are made of quarterernary alloy, containing 50% silver. Rupees of 1940 and onwards, ana half -rupees of'1941 and onwards are also provided with the 'Security Edge'. The hints on iasia detecting counterfeits of earlier issues given in appendix I to follow page 63 of the Resource Manual are equally applicable to these coins, except that the letters and figures are rounded and not sharp edged.Ik %-i' Il5fc v-J (tnstrm BankWimitrir. all letters to be addressed to THE EASTERN BANK LIMITED. f tklegraphic address EASTERTIDE.

GEORGE V &amp; VI RUPEES AND HALF RUPEES You will no doubt have seen Gunn's notice regarding the above silver coins. I gather from previous notices that there is an omission in the notice after ^accepted', but Gunn tells me that the Eastern Bank Ltd., Bahrain, will accept up to 31st October 1943. As only the latest issue of George VI rupees and half rupees are now to remain in use, the Shaikh of Qatar may be expected to be sending in very large consignments to the Bank by Company channels, and I thought you might like to know of this. I presume you are notifying him formally of the Ban^s notice which will not be quite clear to Arabs in that I understand from Gunn that the new issue is also George VI but distinguishable from old George VI in that the new ones have a grooved edge and are much lighter than the old. The old also have a milled edge. Gunn assures me that the Bank will replace silver coins with silver coins, and I assume that you will permit export of silver in these circumstances. Gunn points out that the replacement will necessitate consignments from India and this will take time. If you are writing to the Shaikh on this matter, you may think it desirable to explain the replacement to him2 m DO/CU.1/3267 (concld.) as this will allay the worst of his anxieties. Our Trucial Coast Shaikhs will also be affected, but in previous cases they have not asked for our assistance.

EARLY HISTORY: MINTS CLOSED TO FREE COINAGE These notifications mark the culmination of the policy which had 1 origin more than fifty years ago when the world wide abandonment ^oi silver as a concurrent currency metal with gold compelled the G-overnment of India to close th®ar Mints to the free coining of silver and to convert the rupee which had previously been a full value silver com into a token. The maintenance of such a high silver content as eleven-twelfths has however, created continual complications. Silver,besides lending itself comparatively easily to counterfeiting, has other disadvantages m its pure or nearly pure form as a material for coinage. It was in the iirst p ^ace unduly expensive and the market for its purchase and sale was restricted so that it was difficult and expensive to buy when the orovernment of India needed it and almost unsaleable when the (Govern ment had surplus stocks. For these reasons to it was exposed to unduly speculative influences tiiich often had awkward repercussions on other Indian commodity markets. SILVER CAREFULLY NURSED If ? however, the Government of India had attempted to discard it too quickly, they would not only have injured their own finances, as a large amount ov bheir unds had been locked up in the purchase of the metal ior coinage but, what is more important, would have injured those m this C9untry ? largely belonging to the poorer classes , who had ^ invested m this metal in ^f past at a time when its free exchangeability with the rupee hdd given it an artificial value and when the lack of investment facilities particularly in rural areas© had narrowed their other possibilities of saving. For this reason, silver has had to be carefully nursed by Government of India over the last 15 years, since sales were first initiated.

I suggest that I should be authorised to announce that until further notice the Indian rupee will be the only currency recognised by His Majesty^ Government for all their purposes in the Gulf States and toadvise the Rulers to issue similar declarations. 5. I should be grateful for very early instructions. Yours sincerely, Sd/- W.R. Hay. B.A.B. Burrows, Esq., Foreign Office, London. v I —-/ COP* /- M-628 The Bahrain Petruleum Co.

' as you know, we arrange substantial remittances to Bahrain each month to maintain our operations, and it is essential thiit we at all times have on hand adequate supplies of currency to meet our local payrolls, amounting to approximately JUs. 7,00,000 per month. The Eastern Bank Limited, jianasta, has been importing cur^ ency from Karachi for this purpose. If, as a result of the change in Pakistan or for any other reason, it is decided to change the Bahrain currency certain new arrangements will haive to be made in regard to our remittances to Bahrain and our currency requirementa. jn the light of our experience in endeavouring to arrange for en account to b© opened in Pakistan in our name, it is evident that our negotiations for new arrangements for our Bahrain funds T ^ill be protracted. £e would therefore appreciate your advising us the intentions with regard to the future Bahrain currency* In the event that definite plans have not yet been made, we would be grateful for an indication of the probable plans and further advice of developments froc time to time.

At the present moment not only the Bank and ciovernment Offices but also the merchants and petty traders in the Bazaar are very careful in taking cash when brought in for payment but though the bad coins airs thus teoidered are being rejected there is no doubt that there is a great deal of trouble to check each and every coin tendered when one has to receive large amounts. it would however be a great convenience if an order is issued that mdian Currency wotes which is a legal tender are accepted by the Bank without any discount at all times y and^ if this is done^the present difficulty of debased coinage in Bahrain^ will, in my. opinion, automatic v cally cease. 29-12-32, 4U M-' S. 1, DCFP— 0938* P—(G-861 )-~4.12-30—8,00.000.I am not in agreement with what has passed on this file. I do not see that the Bahrain Govt, is in the least bound to have the Indian Coinage Act applied. It v is true that the Indian rupee is in use , as it is convenient, as Indian trade predominates and as the old Maria Theresa dollar is incon-) venient and Bahrain has no coinage of its own. But Bahrain is an independent State,though we have charge of its foreign agfairSjand if it decides to clip bad coins,I do not see that it need wait for the Agency to apply the Indian Coinage Act. Par better for the Bahrain Govt, to issue a proclamation,with our consent of course, and for us to apply it under Sect.74 of the Order in Council,if we wish to do so. If we apply the Coinage Act , we shall have a mountainous file ,in all probablility , over clipping a few rupees. Please put up the Order in Council. 2. I understand that ortfers which affect foreigners are invariably approved by us before coing into force (just as this on^e has) , so that there does not seem to be any evil preced ent brought into being by letting them issue the proclamation and then our acting on it , just as we do on ,say,the Customs Law. Is this not so ? Please note if there is any consideration to be urged against my view of the matter / - I may easily have overlooked some consideration resulting from the changed times here. 3. I spoke to Adviser and we think on the face of it that there is much to be gained by not aakiag putting legal Acts into force if we can attain our ' ' e direct methods.St/? P.A. ^01 (YV^ Bahrain urder in Council is submitted with Articles 70 and 74 duly flawed. 1 an sure a great deal of trouble would be saved if the not Indian Coinage &lt;vct was^applied here but if this Act was not applied I do pot ^ee how J^j^^^utting of Government of India currency would be legal by an l Alan from the Bahrain ^ovt. Q , ^ Article 74 of the Bahrain urder in council permits the ^ Political resident or an officer subordinate to him, of the frfl bad coins wouH-d notji thinkj be said to be an existing id**'' custom within the meaning of this Article, ,&lt; t V V ' under Article 70 'b) the 'Political Kesident shall have •/ power to make Kegulations ^to be called King's Kegulations)' \ ^ for the P ur P 0S ^ ^ securing the observance of any native W local law or custom, whether relating* to trade, commerce, r ^ revenue or any other matter. ' ''ivV • the above it would appear that the authority to enforce 311 oriler article 74 must be made by means of a King's Regulation under Article ^ 70. me proposed alan of the Bahrain (iovernment (see page 5 in ^ile) mentions penalties (fines, imprisonment etc) which may be awarded for a breach of the alan. in the event of a case coming up in the Agency Courts under this alan, I think s inc© the courts would be powerless to enforce the penalties, xx'the Law under which such cases are tried in the Agency Courts .rould be the Indian penal code M and not the alans of the Bahrain government, The result therefore would be that foreign ers brought before the Agency courts for offences under the alan would not be liable to prosecution, and the Bahrain Govt, alan would, in practice, be a dedd letter, as far as British subjects and foreigners are concerned. right to observe, and to enforce the observance of.. any reasonable custom existing in Bahrain. ihe cutting l.3&gt; /■THa-c tlXXiu - fvi^ 5I dl^cu^ed the matter of the clipping of coins with the i?inancial Advis^ 1 * on the 24th January 1933. Coins have actually been clippeo^ana he has done a number in his court recently with,so far as can be seen,good effect. I read over to him the attached araft,which may now issue and at the same time impressed on him tnat it was necessary to put any order of this sort into force gently at first ana that in any doubtful case the owner of should be given the benefit of the aoubt. 2. So far as we are concerned,if a bad^Q)&amp;£is brought to us for payment of any court fine,it should be brought to me for examination. p, Hh 'UxA- • (J 25-1-1933. I \ I ■52 v-? . A, (iv-V Attached is a chalaan filed by the Rais Police against a Hassavi and an Indian for the offence of selling bad coins. I have not registered it as I wanted to submit it to you before actually dealing with it. The Rais ^-olice has attached Bahrain Proclamation dated 10/11/32 in support of the charge. * The draft proclamation sent by the Adviser on 25/10/32 (page 4) was approved (excluding para 4} by your predecessor on 5/11/32 (page*|) and later you wrote to the adviser (page 18) approving the same proclamation. The proclamation does not state anything about possessing bad coins so there can be no case under that, while Indian Coinage Act has not yet been saforced here so that the accused may be caught under that, therefore, l would suggest that the coins (20 in number) attached by the complainant be clipped and returned to the owner. 25/4/35 ' ! I J i v- Im I m r H•Note- I talked over with the Adviser about the attached representation submitted by the foreign traders. He was of opinion that he will recommend to the Baladiya, which originated the issue of Bahrain Govt Proclamation NO. 53/1351 re the rupee coins on 2/4/33, to cancel it and also talk the matter over with H.K. If this is done the inconvenience felt now will cease. 2/5/33 £A a7' if I On 12th instant I was invited to attend the special Baladiya meeting which was to discuss and consider the question of bad coins. -Ln addition to the Baladiya members the following were also invited to attend the discussion:- (l}Mr De C/rehier (2)Mr Russell (3jMr Ham 14) 4 Indian traders Different topics were discussed in the meeting which could not arrive at any definite tesult. The ringing of rupees was recommended by every one. i'ew urged for the appointment of a 'Sarraf 1 to decide the dispute arising between traders and the Bank over the ringing of coins. The President declared that he was missing the presence of the P.A. when such an important question was being discussed. Prooably there will be another meeting on this very subject. The Baladiya Secretary circulated the attached proposals which were, however, not discussed. -M 13/5/33 A/f-riX £X t*. i,5 lU i 4l*.CsCXi\, ^7 ^ IH 3? . i ieMu aUJUSd. an 4 2^^ d^A. /i ^ SU^ W A— y ^— JUt 111 y Lc^ f^tjo ~k^~e&gt; /U: ' ^ /' / - r„„ i/o 4-^: N ^ : ^/v/? cLaJL^ /&lt;+/&lt;} jsz ^ Jfrx^i^ Petition dated 17-5-36 from twenty merchants of Muharraq..

Submitted with the following remarks t ^ joined the Muscat Agency on let Jenuary 19^7. Before my posting there,the third, clerk used to he a treasurer who was responsible for making payments and closing the bags for the Muscat Currency Chest. The Muscat Treasury being a regular treasury, the accountant has to keep so many registers and to send so many returns to the Controller of Currency, Bombay, monthly. But in addition to this the treasurer 's work was transferred to me, and it is just possible that in rush of work the two bad ruppes have escaped my eyes. In Muscat Treasury the receipts are only credited by the Post Office, and if there were any bad coins the Postmaster should have exchanged. I may add that it has happened so many times that the standard weight of the Rupee is diminished in the circulation. The standard weight of the R upee being one Indian Tola and the Government of India have agreed in their Notification No. M72-A dated the 18th June 1910, that a loss of 6^ per cent below the staddard weight of e ^upee shall be the limit of reasonable wear and such Rupees should be accepted by the Treasury Officer at full value and the amount so received from the Public ; kept In double lock to avoid circulation* The G-rvernment -r of ^ndia have also agreed to pay to the public cost of such Rupees as under (a) Rupees weighing between 15/l6th at the rate of anus fourteen • (b) Rupeas weighing 13/1C do annas 13/- (o) Fupees weighing between 13/16 ..do... ' 12/- K From P.U.C. it appears that the two rupees were sold for ten annas i.e. for annas five each. When they have been sold in the Bazar,it appears they possessed good silver, and I think that they should have been dealt with as per pare 4 (above). A At end T juc* beg to stete^^ince there is precedent in Muscat that such charges were debited to office contin gencies ,some years past, this may also kindly be debited to the same head. ► • k 1 a iLl ■{ i ndjfft ^ . iLr // - -^1 ^ \^i ^tXCv .-. /Vy X ^ ■J-'l-f * ~&lt;i%- ^Ct-y^ S-C^c^ /J ; Ref. pa^.e. 115 .
