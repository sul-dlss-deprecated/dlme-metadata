As told by H.C. (Mr. Stephens) I recovered the amounts from tiie clerks concerned and had kept Rs.il/- separate and Rs.19/2/- separate on my table. He came to me and asked me about the money upon which I told him that the money was reedy. When he saw the money lying on my table, he first took the sum of ds.il/-, counted it and put it in his pocket: he then took the sum of is. 19/2/- which was also taken by him after cnecking. V/hen he took both the amounts, I told him that the first one was his share in the copying fees, and tne second amount was two shares of is.9/9/- each in the Inventory and Attenaance fees for him and Mr. Jasim respectively, and asked him whether he was satisfied. He i' ✓ said all right and left my table. As the account books were not with me at that time, I did not take any initials for tne amounts, and I naturally thought'that he v/ould pay Mr. Jasim his share. During your conversation with him at Sharjah the K.S. admitted that he received his shares in copying fees and Inventory and Attendance fees but he denied having received any extra money representing Mr. Jasim T s share. He admits in his letter under reference that he received tne amount of Rs.19/2/- but now denies having received the sum of Rs.il/- which he took and put in his pocket before receiving the amount of &amp;.19/2/- but I am sure and certain that he did receive both the amounts. copying fees and Bs.19/2/- being two shares of(4 - 2-0 9 Thanh, you for your note# K.S*Abdur Razzaq states that he received Fzl9-2-0 on account of copying fees and inventory charges* He claims that if he was due Ps n-O-O for copying charges then he should receive a farther Rs 2-0-0» The Accounts Clerk contends that he paid the Khan Sahib Rs 11-0-0 on account of copying fees and Rs 19-2-0 on account of the inventory and attendance fees of hr Jassim and himself (K.S*)* It appears that the Khan Sahib v/as entitled to Rps 11-0-0 for copy ing fees and Rs 9-9-0 for inventory^and attendance charges and that those responsible for the faulty payment* I believe that when this error occurred the Head Clerk,who is responsible for the super vision of the accounts,v/as in addition in receipt of a by no means small sum a month for the work involved in supervising the un official accounts and it has been put forward by ineumbants of the post of Head Clerk that this salary was justified not neeessandly on the grounds that they had considerable work but also that there * v/as the responsibility to be considered. I note that the Head Clerl* has contented himself with stating that he came N into the picture when H.M*approached me M * This appears to me to be on the late side for he should have checked the disbursement and supervised the payment and noted that the receipts were properly obtained. I shal] be glad if you will call for his written explanation. I would like to know if Mr ifessim v/as ever paid his Rs 9-9-0 and if his receipt has been obtained.

Dear Weigniman, For many years we have been paying Rs.200/- per month to the Political Agent on account of drugs used in the Victoria Memorial Hospital. As you know the Agency Medical Officer in the past attended the State Police and all Bahrain Government staff who were entitled to free medical attention and also supplied drugs etc. to them free of charge. We now have our own medical staff who are res ponsible for the medical work of the Bahrain Govern ment and we are purchasing yearly large supplies of drugs etc. The Police and all persons who receive free medical attention from the State, are dealt with by the Bahrain Government Medical Officer, the small dispensary at Naim is being used as a temporary hospital. I believe the allowance of Rs.200/- per month was intended to cover the cost of drugs supplied to Police and Bahrain Government and as this expense is now born by the Bahrain Government I think it reasonable to suggest that pajanent should be discon tinued. Yours sincerely, E. 7/eightman,Esquire , I.C.S., H. B. M*s Political Agent, Bahrain.r #0. o* 67S-4m &lt; v/// A ' D#i«K2 th« S6th /pril 1939.

The budget sanctions for the current financial year have since been received. The amount sanctioned under Launch grant is Rs.9.000/-; and there is now a balance of Rs.3237/- in it. In March last Major Hickinootham had given verbal instructions to the then superintendent that the amounts drawn from Joint Court Fees for payment to the carpenters need not be re-imbursed, as the i r~ collections on account of Joint Court Fees could be used for purposes like these. There is now a credit balance of Rs.2029-13-0 in the Joint Court Fees account. Orders are solicited as to whether a) the recovery of Rs.2950/- (items 1 &amp; 2 above) towards the Joint Court Fees may be waived. b) the sum of Rs.1322/5/- (item 3 above) may now be recovered from Launch grant and credited to the Agency^ Funds.
