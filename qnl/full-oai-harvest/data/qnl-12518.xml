The letters are from friends, acquaintances and other correspondents, including a number of army officers, diplomats, writers and travellers with an interest in Persia and Afghanistan.Many of the letters discuss Curzon's recent book,
                           Persia and the Persian Question, as well as the internal affairs of Afghanistan and Persia and British policy regarding both countries, mostly from the perspective of British officers and diplomats who have resided or visited there. Of particular note are a number of letters received by Curzon from Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Molesworth Sykes, writing as British Consul for Kerman and Persian Beluchistan [Baluchistan] (later as British Consul, Kerman). Matters discussed in these letters include the settlement of the frontier between Persian and British Baluchistan.Other notable correspondents include the following: John Richard Preece, British Consul at Ispahan; Sir Henry Mortimer Durand; Sir Frederic John Goldsmid; Henry Lake Wells; Benjamin W Stainton; Albert Houtum-Schindler.All of the correspondence dates from 1895.
