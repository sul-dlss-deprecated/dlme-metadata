I own family and servants and though the original pay was quite insufficient yet 1 was economizing so as to have it distributed among them, if I was spending Ks.330 I reduced it to Ks.225 saving Ks.75. But X see it is impossible for me to save anything now because my family members have increased while my pay has been decreased, i wanted to ask for an increment but as i have already stated i wished to interview first the political Agent and discuss the matter with him. But as he was leaving Bahrain i found that he could not receive any visit then. And as you are aware it is impossible for me to wait for his return because 1 am very hard up. in the circumstances i request you very kindly to consider this case favourably by honouring me with an interview to enable me to discuss the matter with you. if you will be good enough to issue telegraphic instruc tions informing me to come to Bushire I shall be highly obliged to discuss the matter and make everything clear to you.i have not drawn my pay as yet and i have no idea ■of reoeiying it with all this reduction.

I have delivered the former, hut in that for Shaikh Salman he was described as 'TTaib Hakim' (Deputy Ruler). This title was, as you know, used for Shaikh Hamad in his father*s life tire, but should not, of course, be used for Shaikh Salman.
