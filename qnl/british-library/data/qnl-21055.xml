Sir # Sm®® your reeant departure fro 11 Bahrain,I have been very fully a««upied t in consultation with Skaiks Haaad &amp; Abdulla,in reducing to some order,tke chaotie state of the local finances. The prcllitin- aiy work ^as aouplicated by the necessity for a veiy early detenaina -tion of the allowances to be Made to the various iieMbers of A1 Zhalifeh f!a«ily, since the arabic month was drawing to a close &amp; Biany of t^e«,cut off from their usual source of supply, (they were ir the habit of drawing supplies in kind without any limit,leaving Shaik Easa to foot the bill) were in need of funds. Preliminary allowances .subject to future revision,have been detsrmined.^hrough^ut I have borne in mind the paramount necessity for economy,in order that funds may gradually be accumulated to.^aet the expenditure for the introduction oi the reforms re quired to be introduced. Allowances of Al iChalifek family as now arranged amount to some Rs Jf ,000 per mensem.This does not include a considarable pensions list &amp; the monthly salaries of officials of all classes. In some cases allowances have had to be increased, to allow for the fact that in future ,no member of the family will be entitled to purchase requirements at the expenee of the state. Every person to whom an allowance has been made will have to ma.£e it suffice for his needs &amp; has been clearly given to understand that no extra bills can be run up. This system will effectually put a stop to the incredibly waste of public money which has bgen permitted in the past.I estimate that about half a lafeh per Mansem has been spent unnecessarily in t^e past,in addition to taih allowances drawn .Of this sum approximately Z% was clear profit to T Ali bin Abdulla,uncle of the notorious Jasim Ohirawi,. -8«3lf of tha money at no veiTZf dintant 5a t«. fkis we haye decided to &amp; Itrust it will meet with yo-ir approval.

I fully sym pathize with the difficulties with which you and Shaikh Hamari are faced in these very necessary reductions of ex travagant expenditure but feel myself bound to enter a pro test against drawing on the surplus in hand from collections on outs t and in§f dues to the Customs, and should have pre ferred the reduction of allowances all rO'und when it was found that the monthly revenues were running low. It may not be advisable to allow recurring charges on the Civil List to fluctuate from month to month but the experience of a full year's imome will shortly no doubt enable you to reduce such recurring charges to their proper proportion . Such, payments , however , as are alluded to in the closing paragraph of your letter , should at once be cut off with the utmost rigour when the monthly revenues are unable to meet the charge . I thi.nk 1 may safely take upon myself the respon sibility of assuring both Shaikh Hamad and yourself that no intercessions by His Highness the Sultan of ^ejd in favour of Shaikh 1 isa will have the smallest influence onon myBell , the Government of India or His Majesty's Govern ment , and I see no objection whatever to your letting this be generally known in any quarter in which you think it likely to be useful.

You will renember that ha undertook; not to increase any allowances without consulting mo ^ that I pointed .iat to you tho necessity for an undertaking §f this nature to ensure the treasury being in funds for the ■nrovision of tha ref^nss decided upon or likely to be introduced in the future. 'Halle Bamad ' loo has his o ffic^l Residence kept up for him out of tho public ^'orks fund &lt;% his incowe is solely for his privite needs • for entortaimtojit•His groun up sons hare scmartr &gt; allovmncos.I regret hevover that he has not the remotest iflea of econoMiy &amp; appears to be incapable ©f refusing to give Bumey to oth^r nembors of the fanily when they beg of hiEi,in spite of the fact that they have all separate allowances. Ho continues to Iceop a stud of fifty horses &amp; large herds of camels in addition to several motor cars &amp; of course a ridiculously large &amp; worthless retinue, I have constantly brought to his notice the nece sity for economy,but although he professes to be cutting down his expenditure to a minimum I regret I have bf?en able to detect little result. It Is P933ibl# t th9ugh at thia staga difficultto judg«,thRt the Bahrain Govermsent r©s©urc&lt;ig csuld pro with f slight incr«a3«,but in the first place I d@ mt see the neceaait.T ^ seooadly I f©ar It would not do th@ slightest good, &amp; feel suri th n t in a few months he wouia gain be in difficulties &amp; ask for * further increase,His present idea is tMt he needs at least another five thousand a month &amp; really vants ten thousand more which seems to be out of th^ question. I told him that he already knew of the views expressed by Colonel iCnox,which I felt sure,in view of the necessity for reserving soiae of the public jaonoy for the administration,you would endorse,&amp; 'Giuit 1 oould not ©n ny own authority agree to such an increase ^/hich would undoubtedly 3pen the do qb to simiT^r demands by every m«»ber of ths faraily. I think what is really required is for it to brought forcibly homo to him that he must economise &amp; cfe®not expect to constantly get more frora the treasury. I would suggest therefore,if you saa fit that you should write him a letter saying that I have referred the matter to you &amp; that you do not see your w&amp;j to agreeing to an increase of his allowance ?rhich seems to be mor® than adequate.If he gets such a letter from you he will be in a m^od for retrenelament will doubtless listen to my advice as to several ways in which a saving could be affected.When he has felt the pinch littla &amp; has genuinely nf?do an effort to cut down expenditure, it m&gt;j bo possible to give him r little mere by way of extra allowances for upkeep of say two stae m©-cors or something of the sort rather than acquiescing in f?n increased^: allowance,but if we give hia more now I have not tho slightest doubt th t he will return to the charge again in a few months time .A definite set bacic now would «ake him careful.The position is that he giv^s out largoosa to othar combers of the family who already h^ve ^3,l©wanc©8,&amp; by pleading for himself l?ill indirectly increasing such allowances all round in spite of the fact that they were granted on a most generous sc«le. ^ hkve a small -n® in h?nd to meet occasional extra demands,set &amp;3id9 in a special emergency fund,but I am loth to allow him to start drawing, on this while he has made no genuine effort to live within his income.He is not in debt,^ if he finds he cannot get more V simply asking for it*could easily cut down his expenditure by atr th« 09 3t ®f ret farms proposed th© estimates fwrnsi which are Hnel.U.i«d in the Bad^-et with sn margin in every case,as will be seen from the remarks against ?iach item. The position is th* t the has at the moment over three lakhs Bupees in hand .Of this it is prepesed te earanrk ©ne lakh f#r isprevementB t@ bring the easterns up to date t by building sheds t© protect merchandise en th® wharf,complete the easterns Jetty ,lay a narrow guage track far a©Ting ma chandise,^ te build a small heuse on a site already available ,fer the easterns Diracter. The actual cest of all these is estimated by Mr Bower &amp; say self t© be about Hg 88,000 bat the .haik agree b that we should allew I If kh te be en the safe side. We then have two lakhs in hand t© meet any initio expenditure for levies,such as prevision of huts etc ^ initial equipment &amp; possibly for the provision or part provision of a water supply ,which would be an immense b^on to tho people of Manameh. In addition some mf ths refoins proposed will not be carried out &amp; become a coat to the state for seme months meanwhile * the He serve will be still further mounting upj^ Apart from this the Budget shows that when &amp; if 11 the proposed reforms are in full awing we can count on a monthly excess of receipts over expenditure of at lei st Hs 20,000 pe mensem • I say 'at least 1 because receipts hava been purposely estimated on most conservative basis,while expenditure has been given a conside -?^le margin under aach head. r J?he Budget has been prepared for one month insted of one yeaar,which it is hoped will be equally useful,but receipts are the average monthly receipts bsned on a careful study of the figures of the st three years.The somewhat astonishing improvement is of coarse due to an immense amount of shesr waste,largely within the customs itself,which it has been possible to curtail.Ho allowance has becm m&amp;de for tho increase jr.rsoalpta wfeieh w.uld result if the inore&amp;ac of ouataaa prop.a# - be smnctianed, bat thia lncr9«&gt;8e would aaoant (Bstimate&lt;3 by Bawwr) t9about Ha 16500 « raonth. ?h« astiaate of Ha 40OO //] V 1 ; )'-■ un1 * r ®i3«®lan«ORs headlngs.on tho r«c«4pta aide,la ' very conj^errntiTe ene.Court fees elorn .in tee Bshmln Court,h«ve recently been amounting to about Ha 1000 a month.

Hakhudas ; re at present being sent to him in disputes about accounts ab they are producing their Recounts which they never would do before.He is disallowing the iniquitous interest charged &amp; they are ? ccepting the situatio which shows a great change in their attitude.A typical cess is ^ recent one in which the IJakhuda claimed Rs I05® &amp; eventually only proved before the Oadhi Rs 300 &amp; accepted the decistoi. I have recently for the first time got hold of an account book. I am having accounts translated as typical exfmp'os.In several crises divers Jjave worked for ye^rs receiving only about Hs6 for each actual month of diving t all other advances being recorded ns debts -^von if they had not been recorded as debts but h^d be finally paid ta tham without recavary thay wsuld have racaivad anearn h«re.^eing thaoraticrrlly in debt they cfinnot nscap© th@ Nakhuda.

It would remove all the difficulties connected with the l%khudas sailing the pearls without the knowledge of the divers thus swindling them, IfcL 3haik ^amad is s actively engaged in the reforms as he can be &amp; is taking more personal interest than I had anticipated Set certainly as much as anybody vvho knows A1 Ilhallfeh family could ever expect.) It is believed th^t the pro ®sod increao of Customs would have very little effnet on the cast of living.It would certainly not materially affect the poorer classes,whose staple diet is dates which Pre not imoortelp ^haiM Hamad has already agreed to remit castoms on slaughter animals.This will not affect Customs recipts in cash as the duty has hitherto been received in kind ^ has been handed over to the shaiks for their own use.This will be a great benifit to the community,It is &gt;r®psed to introduce it s aset-off to the other increases. The increase suggested is Hs 1-4 per contp On the other hand it is estiraated that as soon s the railway is in situ we can afford to redfiiee the handling costs considerably. ^ls® the ag-r-ement of the landing ctapanjr shortly exi^ires ^ it is pro ^osed that the inereae of loi in charges rhich was agreed to in 1921 should be taken of.f^as (the condition of renewal of the contract the increase having been given owing t© increased cost of labeut which h ;ssince fallen considerably.

My friend , I am rather sur prised to hear this as I hear that the State paid off all your debts before you assumed charge of the State t and also provides a house for you from public funds . But I learn that the reason for your finding it difficult to make both ends meet is that in addition to your legitimate expenditure , which ill itself seems to be rather unduly large , you are in the habit of giving money to any of the ill Khalifa family who come and ask you for it. My friend , you have already , in view of the fact that the finances of the State are not vtry flourishing and that besides we do not know accurately what the ordinary receipts and expenditure will be , agreed not to increase the allowances of any of the KhalifaKhalifa without first consulting the Political ^.gent . To give your relations money whenever they ask for it amounts to supplementing their allowances out of your own pocket. If you do this voluntarily and bear the expense of course it is no one's concern but yours w but if, my friend, you supplement their allowances out of your pocket and then ask for an increased allotment from the Bahrain State Funds it amounts to ask ing the State to increase indirectly the allowances of these members of the Al Khalifah which it is already unable to do directly , and this , I am sure you will agEee is impossible. I counsel you, my friend , to use every effort to keep your expendit ure within bounds , and within your allowance . Later on if and when the State funds are in a sound condition, aad even by that time you find it diff icult to keep within your allowance, ths question might possibly be reconsidered. U .E .

I fear that the estimate of Rs20,000/- will 'be exceeded, although a very careful watch is 'being K^pt upon expenditure. Pier Trolleys : The cash expenditure represents freight on trolleys from Karag Island, and cost of painting same. The Government owns forty trolleys and twenty-eight tubs.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that before leaving England dhaikh Hamad bin Esa, the Shaikh-Regent of Bahrain, requested lajor G.K.Daly, the Political Agent, to seek for a British officer who would come to Bahrain as Financial Adviser or H Vazir H , i.e. in a capacity somewhat similar to that of Mr. Bertram Thomas, O.B.E., who was engaged fur Muscat last April. 2. An officer has been found who seems in every way suitable. He is Mr. Gharles Dalrymple Belgrave, Administrative Officer (cadet) on_ leave from Tanganyika Territory, East Africa. He has informed the Colonial Office, that he does not wish to return to Tanganyika. I understand that the Colonial Office are not likely to place any difficulty in the way of Mr. Belgrave resigning Government Service. 3. I have interviewed Mr. Belgrave. He is aged 31. He can speak Arlabic Swahili and French. During the War he served in Egypt in both Military and Civil capacities. He is the author of H Siwa, the Oasis of Jupiter Ammon', published by John Lane. He has passed examinations in Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidences Act, Criminal Procedure Code and local laws and ordinances. 4. As it is desired that he should start on his duties in Bahrain in Bovember next, I request that you will kindly obtain the sanction of the Government of India to the arrangement by cable. Mr. Belgrave will pay the cos tcoot ix it is required of him; perhaps he can afterwards recover from the Bahrain State. xhe details ot the agreement 'between the Bahrain State; and Mr. Belgrave cannot be settled at once. A comparisdm of the terms given to Mr. Thomas at Muscat and jir. De u-renier, ohe Director of Customs at Bahrain, is necessary. But it is certain that to. Belgrave's initial salary will be at least equivalent to Es. 800/- £er mensem . I will be grateful if your reply can be posted oo me at Bushire, Persian Gulf, as I sail from England ■ to-morrow.

Prom The Hon'ble Lieut-Col. F. B. Prldeaux, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the foreign and Political Department, Simla* Financial Mviser for Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to refer to telegram Ko, 1176-3, dated the 21»t September 1925, from the GoYernment of India in the Foreign and Political Department in reply to my recommendation that the Shaikh of Bahrain may he allowed to engage an Englishman as Financial Adviser and that the selection of Mr* C. Belgrave be approved for the post. 2. At present Shaikh Hamad and the Municipality tff Man amah (the chief town of Bahrain) lean very much on the Political Agent for guidance and assistance in various questions, which strictly speaking are internal matters though they also affect the comfort of the foreign populat- -ion residing in Bahrain. In consequence, Major Daly, in spite of his intimate knowledge of the Arabic language and of local affairs, is very much over-worked. •! do not expect that any Political Agent succeeding him will be able to do as much for the State as he has done. 3. The Government of India are now, I believe, un- -willing to give the Political Agent a gazetted Assistant and from their telegram Ho. 142-H, dated the let October 1925,03 1925, it appears that an insuperable difficulty has ocourr- ~ed in t&amp;e matter of the deputation of a Hevenue Officer to the islands to carry out the Land Revenue Settlement. With the appointment of Mr. Belgrave I think that all need for these two officers will cease. 4. Mr# Bclgrave, who will work as Personal Assistant to Shaikh Hamad and Supervisor in all administrative matt- -ers, will have the benefit of Major Daly's experience and advice at first. When this Political Agent leaves the State, the Financial Adviser will, I feel sure, be able to stand entirely on his own feet. 5. In Muscat it has been found necessary to find for the Ruler an Inglish Administrator to rescue the Sultanate from a state .of insolvency. In Bahrain the necessity arises from a totally different cause. 6. The revenues of the State are greater thaJi the Chief and his Arab advisers can judiciouily spend* It is recognised that the income is likely to expand and that the growing community of Europeans, Americans and educated Arabs Persians and Indians are entitled to expect their condition of life to be improved. If anything comes of the competition between different Companies for an oil concession there may be a large and new influx of Europeans and their followers in the near future. 7. Shaikh Hamad in conversation has evinced to me his apprehension as to how his Administration will fare after the departure of Major Daly. Later on, he informed me through the Political Agent that he thought that the intro- -duction of an officer like Mr. Thomas of Muscat would be the most satisfactory solution. 6v I should mention here that Mr. de Greniere, the Director of Customs, is not a suitable man for the post. HeHe is not peyeona|a itrata with Shaikh Hamad, partly 'becauBe he has made little effort to acquire pro- -ficiency in the Arabic language and partly because he is addicted to proposing extraragant schemee, while at the ©asie time he i® a poor Bupenricor of expenditure. His engagement will probably be terminated at the end of 3 years, and it is believed that it will then be poeaible to engage a Bucceeeor in the Customs Department more cheaply^ 9. SftBT examining the contracts made with Mr. de Grcniere and Captain 'homas (of Muscat), I find it necessary to recommend a higher rate of salary than I had proposed in London as J do not think that Mr. Belgrave*8 remuneration should be less than jck&amp;t Mr• de Greniere^. To a certain extent the Financial Adviser and Personal Assistant to Shaikh Hamad will be the Customs director's superior officer. 10. 1 therefore propose for Mr. Belgrave the follow- •ing terms ;• Pay: Bs. 1000 — 50 — 2200. Out of this Ss. 200/- p.m. will be put into a Provident Fund opened in the Eastern Bank, Ltd. Period of engagement: T^rainatoe on thr s months 1 notice. Quarters: Free, or Bs. 100/- p.m. in lieu. Furlough: li months p.a. on full pay or 3 months on half pay, earned aftei 4 years* service. Leave: X month p.a. in India. Passages; 1 free let class on appointment and completion of service, also on furlough to 1ngland and on leave to India. 11. I trust that these proposals will meet with the approval of the Government of India. 1 shall be grateful if I may be informed by telegraph of their orders, in order that I may comnunicate the same to Mr. Belgrave as quickly mm 1 have the honour to be, as possible.

Sir, I have the honour to forward a copy and duplicate of the Budget for the Bahrain State for the year 1345. The Budget is a very conservative one. I think it is likely that the estimated revenue will be exceeded. Already after the third month of the year revenue has 'been collected amounting to Hs. 3,17,500/-, which is Rs. 1,05,000/- in excess of the receipts estimated for the three months- Sru^rf- U A certain margin has 'been left on the expenditure side, but it seems likely that this will be required to meet the unforseen expenditure incurred in connection with the disbanding the Levy CJorps and Police, paying for the troops lent to the^GrOvernment of India, and enlisting a new Police force. I beg to draw your attention to the fact that no provision has been made for the expense of compensating the Arab owners of certain property which was confiscated by the State and should this action be decided upon, it would be necessary to break into money set aside for other purposes such as roads or the Electric Scheme, for which the State is not yet definitely committed. I have the honour to be, C* 4 Sir, Your Obedient Servant, ' Adviser,D.O. No. 521-S /. /i'^ A/2. 6tli December 1926 vVith reference to the last paragraph of my memorandum Ho. 519-3., of today's date.

British Residency &amp; Consulate-General. Bushire, the 6th December 1926. To The Political Agent, Bahrain, MEMORANDUM. /h'&gt; Reference your memorandum Ho, 113/9/2, dated the 25rd October i926, wj.th which were enclosed two copies oi the Bahrain Sta^e Budget Estimates for 1345, the Hon 1 ble the Political Resident has noticed that no Estimates were submitted to this office for the year 1344. He accordingly wishes that the actual figures for that year should be summarised under the usual heads, ana submitted to him, so that he may compare the figures for the last 2 years. 2. Your attention is also invited to the fact that in September last, when the Hobble the political Resident was in Bahrain, Mr. Belgrave furnished him with a cash statement for 1344 showing an opening balance of Rs. 8,00,320 and a closing balance of Rs. 5,38,487. 3. These figures differ materially from those shown as the closing balance in the - l 343 estimate, forwarded by Major Daly with his memorandum Ho. 169/9/2, dated the lith July 1924, and as the opening balance now shown for 1345. 4. It is understood that the former discrepancy is due to an excess of Rupees two laidas in the Customs Receipts, and to the fact that a balance of Rupees three laichs in Bombay was brought into account, but the second discrep ancy in the opening balance for 1345 is not understood. 5. Your attention is also invited to the fact that though the income for the year is only estimated at ks . 8,69,478, the expenditure totals Rs. 17 ,72,926.The Hor^ble the Political Hesident considers that some at least of the balance in hand at the begining of the year should be retained as a reserve, as it will be quite impossible to maintain anything approaching this rate of expenditure in immediately succeeding years, 6. I am also to draw your attention to the item Civil List, allowances to Ruling Family, which seems unduly high, and is actually more than that shown in the estimates for 1345. The political Resident hopes this item will not be allowed to go on increasing. By Order Captain, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf# P.B.deS.No. /Hhzof 1926.

Mr. Belgrave, however, points out that account must be taken of the fact th4t income during the last 3 months of a year are usually very meagre. A certain margin has been left in the expenditure sidi but this will protobly be required to meet outgoings on account of the disbanded Lfcvy Corps, tho raising of the new Police force and the Government of India's charges for the detachment of the Indian Army iiow in Bahrein. Mr.Belgrave points out that no provision has been made for compensating Arab owners whose property has been confiscated by the Bahrein State. As, however, the Bowasir have hitherto shown no desire to come to any terms with Shaikh Hamad's Government, I think that this point may safely be ignored political Agent, Bahrein. e 4QOVKKHKSOT 0?

Sir, / With reference to letter H©: 519/S of 1926, from the British Hesldency ana Consul General, Buahlre, forv/arded by you for Information, 1 have the honour to make the following lexnarks.- 1. With refej enoe to paragraph one; no annual Budget was made for the Bahrain State for the year 1544. At that time and until soTnetime after ray arrival, all the finanoial work of the State was in the hands of H. B# M's Political Agent, 'ho dealt with it partly at the Government Of floe and partly at the Agenoy, Major Daly was on leave during part of 1343 and part of 1344, and it appears that the acting Political Agent mad© no Budget, bat authorised expenditure roughly on the Scale of the Budget for 1543. 2. Major Daly on his return to Bahrain isade a provisional Budget for the rcnalnlng seven months of the year, dated 27th Jarnadl Al Awal, but this Budget was cancelled ano substituted by another one dated ISth Shawal, for the remaining throe months of 1544. n f hen I began to do the financial work of the State, the second of these Budgets was in force. Owing to all this, it has been extremely difficult to verify records of all the accounts for 1344. A corrected statement of i.evenue and Bxpenditure for that* that year t as far as oan 'be ascertained from the existing reoords, is attached. I wouia mention that during this time there was no regular aooouatant clerk In th3 Government 0ffi&lt;?6» much of the work and aooounts were done by Major Daly himself, 3. With reference to paragraphs tv^o and throe. In the Budget for 15543, the estimated closing 'balance was put at Rs« 2 f 46 # 510/- # but the act^l closing 'balance was greatly in excess of thia estimate for the following reasons# (I) Only Hs. o6 f l?3/- was spent out of the three laos which were allocated to '-fater Supply. (II) An increase of Ks. ?i t 17 f 66l/« over the est teat od lis. 10 # 25 1 000/• received from the Customs# 1?his large increase seems to have resulted from the war in Arabia which closed r.ed 3er ports and so increased imnorte into Ilejcl, via the Gulf; also from a good pearling season in 134£. 4. The saving from I and the increase in II # would result in an additional Es. 4 f 61 f 488/- to the estimated closing balance from 1J543» f rhe 1343 Budget is stated to have been a very conservative one; the difference between the estimated closing balance and the actual closing balance was about Es. 6 t 50 t 000/- • 6. During the years 1343 &amp; 44 f various amounts were transferred from the funds in Bahrain and put into deposit account at the Lloyd*s Bank, Ltd., Bombay. 1?he closing balance shown in the attached statement does not include the three lacs which were on fixed deposits at the end of 1344. 6. 1?he opening balance for 1344 was made up as follows Cash in fixed Deposits .. .. .. Es. 3,00,000/- Ourront accounts, Bombay 8S # 789/- Bahr ai n. 1,09 ♦169/ l t 91 # 978^- Survey Account .• •* *« 51,706/- Beposit Account •. .. .. 3,59 t 604/- Hs» 9,03,448/-?• 'Then the second Budget was made for 1344, the separate aoaounts then existing, whleh nunbered ahout a doxen, ere all merged Into three, the Oonsoliar.ted Fund, the Deposit acoount, nnd tho Survey Aooount. Various aitiounts whioh were held in the custody of the Govermaent, such as deposits made by Brokers, Police, and monies due to the various Court Oases, are included in the Deposit Acaount^ For this reason the total cash in the deposit account is shown as an asset and certain amount is shown on the De'&amp;it side of the Budget as due to the Deoosit Account. 8. With reference to paragraph 4; the estimated expenditure for 1345 is necessarily large owing to payments for several important Public .'orks falling due during the year, such as the Shaikh's Hew Palace in Manama, the Sea Road, and the State Offices, and also payment for most of the wells under the well-horing contract. 9. At the same time I would point out that the amount of Es. 1,00,000/- set apart for the Bloctrio Pov/er Scheme, can he considered as a reserve, as it is unlikely that t ie State \7ill he committed to any such scheme during the year. It is certain that at the most only half of the allotment for the upkeep of Beads will he spent, and it is also sure that a saving of atleast half of Ks. P&gt;6,000/- for oompensatlon in Land Jases, will he effected. The expenditure on Education is shown at Bs. 36,000/- whereas the total expenditure is Hs. lS t 000/- and the balance is raerely set aside for future developments in this direction. 10. It is quite understood that the expenditure for 1344 is out of proportion to the Bevenue. ( rhis is owiag to the various Public lorks mentioned above.-4- ')i They wer^ deaia@d f in most oases notimlly otmmenoed, before my arrival. 11. ^ith reference to paragraph 6. The increase under this head is aecounted for hy the alio ance now made to H. E« Shaikh Isa Bin Ali, of Bs. 4,000/- per month® Burin? previous years, I un^er- st^nd that ho r ©fused to aooept this, and so no provision was made for it in the Budget, I am forwarding a separate letter on this subject• IE# I beg to enclose a statement of accounts for the half year ending 30th Jamadi A1 f i?hany 1345 - mh December 1926 # from which the financial position of the State can be clearly ascertained. v/ I have the honour to be.

The Civil List already appears to me to be unsuitably l^pge# It consumes about half the estimated revenue of the State and the Hobble the Political Hesident has called attention to it in his letter* In additions to the regular monthly payments^Shaikh Hamad authorised, during my absence in India, the payment of Rs. 6,000/- to himself, Rs. £,000/- to his brother Shaikh Abdulla and Rs. 1,500/- to his other brother Shaikh Mohomed. This was a special allowance made to cover the move of the Shaikhs from Maharaq to Manama. It is perhaps unnecessary to mention that the actual move cost less than Rs. 500/-, and that Shaikh Hamad 1 s private Bank account showed a credit of Rs. 71,000/- at the time. The allowance was formerly an annual one, but last year after discussion with Major Daly, Shaikh Hamad agreed that it should cease, and so no provision was made for it in the Budget. In addition to the above a further Rs. 6000/- per annum has been paid to Shaikh Hamad on the Eid A1 Kabir, and another annual paymen^to various lesser members of the Khalifa family, most of whom already draw allowances, totalling Ks. 1,300/-^was made last month being a customary allowancea llowance for purohase of dates. Altogether, the various a llowanoes are as follows.- Civil List Pensions Summer move Hid Celebrations Hate allowance Bs. 4,21,140/- 7,524/- 9,500/- 6,000/- 1,500/- Rs. 4,45,464/ from another letter DO lo, 5E1/S dated 6-12-26, from Captain Stewart Horner to yourself, I see that the Civil List at Musaat is about Rs. 1,38,000/- per anmun. Before Major Daly left. Shaikh Hamad again agreed, in my hearing, that he would not authorise any increase or new allowances except under very exceptional circumstances and after discussion with the Political Agent. While I was in India, he sanctioned an allowance of Rs. 425/- per month to Shaikh Khalifa Bin Hamad Bin Mohomed il Ehalifa, a person whose allowance was forfieted some two years ago on account of his unsatisfactory conduct and activities in Teheran and Constantinople. Shaikh Hamad now wishes that the Government should pay an allowance to his relative Shaikh Ali Bin Khalid, lately released from prison after undergoing five months Rigorous Imprisonment,to which he was sentenced 'by Shaikh Hamad as punishment for returning without permission to Bahrain whence he had 'been banished in connection with the murder of some Bahrain subjects. In D.O. Wo. 521/3 of 6-12-26, the list of allowances drawn by the Ruling family of Muscat is sent to help me to determine the question of allowances in Bahrain. But the scale of allowances in Muscat is entirely different to that of Bahrain. When I advise the Shaikh not to consider raising an allowance or instituting a new one, the applicant almost invariably refers to you. //pflPBNTIAl** Ho.C o2l of 1927. Political Agency, Bahrein.

Memorandum o Please refer to your memorandum Ko.519-S. dated the 6th December 1926„ The reason for the omission to furnish Budget estimates for the year 1344 is given in the enclosed letter Ko.489/N dated the 17th January 1927 from the Adviser to the Bahrein Government, I understand from Mr.Belgrave that the compilation of figures relating to x)ast years has been a matter of great difficulty as accounts were not audited. He informs me of one case in which a sum of Hs.3,800/- was carelessly entered on three separate occasions as Hs.380/- and incorrect totals all were thus reached« Such mistakes naturally make/accounts unreliable. really My predecessor's/astounding energy established a certain amount of order, but minute personal supervision of all departments of the State administration, in addition to the heavy work which ggitMiari iy falls to the lot of the Political Agent at Bahrein in the ordinary course, was too much even for a man of Major Daly's outstanding industry unassisted as he was byoa trained subordinate staff. I think in the circumstances it would be better to ignore an^ estimates based on the Bahrein State Budget for 1345 as it is by no me^ns a reliable guide as to the actual state of affairs. 2. Mr.Belgrave has now again scrutinised the figures for 1344. As a result of his scrutiny he confirms the figures2. Rs. 8,00,320/- as the opening balance but gives Rs.9,03,448/- as the closing balance, 3 # The estimates for 1343 are quite unreliable. The figure of Rs.5,38,487/- quoted by Mr.Belgrave to Colonel Prideaux is a big underestimate of the actual position as disclosed when he prepared the figures for this Budget, Rs.3,82,789/- of the difference is due to the fact that he did not include the State money held by Lloyds Bank in Bombay, 4, A total expenditure of Rs.17,72 ,926/- for the current year is not now expected. As explained by Mr.Belgravw the expenditure for the current year 1345 was estimated at a very high figure owing to the expectation that payments would have to be made for several fublic Works commenced in former years. It is no^r expected that very considerable savings will be made so that a large sum should remain in reserve on the com pletion of the year. In future years llr.Belgrave will budget for a reserve, 5, As explained by ^r.Belgrave the increase in the allowances paid to the Ruling family is due to the acceptance during the current year of the Rso4000/- payable to Shaikh oir Isa bin Ali, which he had refused to touch i0 past years. This although a disadvantage from a purely financial point of view is a distinct political gain. The allowances paid to the A1 Khalifa family are all proportion to the revenue from the point of view of an European administration and I am quite sure the State does not reap a commensurate advantage from this heavy expenditure. These allowances are, however, part of the system of Government which has been in force since the Al Khalifa family established themselves in Bahrein. The underlying idea appears to be that the islands were conque^red b^ the family and Uie ruling ohaikh administers them for the benefit of x-he family as a whole, each member of which considers himsell entitled in virtue oi his birth to a share of what I might describe as tne plunder. In the past a single subordinate member has on more than one5 • occasion received more than half the revenues of the island. This conception of the unity o£. the Khalifa family is borne out by the system under which, as ShaiKh Htmiad inform^me, it holds its lands. The ruling Shaikh gifts lands to various members of the family, but on the death of the holder the property does not necessarily descend to his legal heirs but is resumed by the Shaikh and re-granted to such members of the A1 Khalifa as he considers most deserving. The ruling Shaikh is no doubt guided in such matters by a family council. If the State is to prosper on modern lines this large alienation of revenues will have to be curtailed. Shaikh Hamad has promised that he will not grant any further allowances from public funds to members of the A1 Khalifa without consulting the JPolxtical Agent ana I have assured ir. Bel grave of my support in preventing any further siXxaxxJULKs additions of this sort to the Bahrein Civil List. Political Agent, Bahrein. im.■m Ho. C. /V?A of 1927. Political .-igericy, Baiire:.n.

Dated, 10th Maharam 1346 To The H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that H. E. Shaikh Hamad wishes to make the following increases and additions to the State Civil List. There has 'been a large amount of previous correspondence on this subject and finally Shaikh Hamad promised that he would make no alterations without first submitting them to you for approval. I would point out that the total revenue for the State as estimated for this new year, 1346, is Rs. 9,38,946/-, and that the present civil list including various extra payments such as 'Summer Move' , 'Date Allowance' and 'Religous festivals' amounts to Rs. 4,69,344/-. Shaikh Hamad wishes to make the following increases.- 1. Shaikh Salman Bin Hamad, eldest son of Shaikh Hamad, age 32, his present allowances being.-page -2- Present salary Duty pay for acting as Magistrate Increase Total Hs» Shaikh Salman owns a large number of Dategardens 'besides market property in Manama and Maharaq* He olaims several whole villages and the surround ings. The alleged reason for an increase is that he has had difficulties with his Bahrani tenants over rent, also that his uncle, Shaikh Ahdulla draws Bs. 6000/-, monthly which is out of proportion# All the Khalifa Shaikhs have difficulties over collecting their date garden rents as they usually manage to let them for more than they are worth* I suggested to Shaikh Hamad that if in his Opinion, the allowance of Shaikh Ahdiilla is too high, he should take steps to reduce it. He himself does consider it to high hut he loath to change it owing to the unpleasantness that would undoubtedly ensue. 2. Shaikh Khalifa Bin Salman, son of a brother of Shaikh Hamad, who died many- years ago. Age 34. Present allowance Rs. 350/- proposed inorease 200/ - Rs. 550/- (Hls wife also draws a small allowance of Es. 40/-). The reason stated for this allowance being increased is that Sh. Khalifa has two sons one of whom has lately married and therefore causes increased expenditure to his father also trouble with tenants. Rs. 600/- 200/- 300/- 1100/--3- &lt;s Shaikh Khalifa has for several years 'been in high favour with Shaikh Isa who has at various times gifted him property^ During the last year he has 'been ahle to afford to marry twice. All Shaikh Hamad's own sons who are of age, with the exception of Shaikh Salman, receive Rs. 350/- only, therefore there does not appear to fee any reason for an increase to the ahove p 3. Shaikh Ali Bin Khalid. At present receives no allowance. Age 30/-. proposed amount. Rs. SOO/-. Third son of Shaikh Eh c -.lid who together with his family was 'banished for life from Bahrain in punishment for the two Sitra murders. Shaikh Ali returned to Bahrain ahout a year ago although 'banished for life. He was imprisoned for 6 months which was then reduced to 5 months. Since then he has 'been a guest in Shaikh Hamad's house, fed, housed, clothed by Shaikh Hamad. Two gardens let at Rs. 1550/-, per year, which previously belonged to him were given 'back some six months ago. Shaikh Hamad wishes him to receive a regular allowance in order that he may live independently. He has no property of his own. 4. Ali Bin Hamad Bin Mohomed Bin Salman, age 18. present allowance nil. proposed Rs. 30/-. The above is a distant relation of Shaikh Hamad, has no property 'but is quite capable of earn ing money.5. Shaikh Hamad's fourth son, Mubarak, is shortly going to he married when this takes would, according to custom receive Ks. 350/- similarly to his other 'brothers. If these allowances are sanctioned the total increase in the Oivil List will be Rs. 12,960/- per annum 'bringing the Civil List up to Rs. I have allowed in the new Budget, for the sum of Rs# 2,280/-, additional to the present amount paid in the Civil List, which was intended to meet any increases that might be sanctioned. My own opinion is that apart from the allow ance to Shaikh Mubarak there is no genuine necessity for the suggested increases. If Shaikh Hamad wishes to increase and to make new allowances it should be done, as was decided in the time of Major Daly, by a cor responding reduction from the allowances of those members of the family who draw the largest allowances f that is, from Shaikhs Hamad, Hohomed and Abdulla. The Hon'ble the Political Resident previously forwarded to me a copy of the Muscat Oivil List, hoping that it would be of use to me in determining the scale of allowances for the Ruling family. A comparison shows that the Ruling family here consume a far greater proportion of the State's revenue than the ruling family in Muscat. Finally I would suggest that the time has come to make some changes in the allowances, and that the allowance of Shaikh Abdulla, Rs. 6000/- per month, might-5- I. mighu b© sligh-tily re duo© d in ordsr 'fco covor any suggested increases.

Sir, With reference to your letter Ho. 0. 105 of 22nd September, 1927, regarding enquiry from the Hon''ble the Political Resident on the subject of interest on the 'Deposit Account', I have the honour to inform you that the Eastern Bank, Ltd, Bail rain, has never been in the habit of giving any interest on money deposited with it, by the Bahrain Government. The 'Deposit Account' consists mostly of deposits in various criminal and civil suits pending in the Bahrain Court. The cases are heard and judgments delivered, without long notice and it is impossible to know when payments will be made. It has therefore been difficult to place any portion of the Deposit Account onon deposit for any fixed period. The amounts keep changing from time to time, as old oases are settled, and fresh deposits reoeiyed, in new oases. Four laos of the Government funds are at present on fixed deposit in Bombay yielding interest varying from 3 | to 4^. It la hoped that another lao will shortly he added to the ahove, owing to satisfactory receipts. It is necessary to keep a considerable amount of cash in the consolidated fund for current payments, hut as much as is possible is always 'being placed on fixed deposits.

The reductions have been made with due consideration to the property and the status of the various individuals. A number of the Khalifa family have recently come into possession of large estates, date gardens, owing to the final settlement of an estate case that has been under litigation for the last 26 years.

Political Agent,Bahrein.GOVKRXiiiiifT OF BAHRAIN 0 So. of 13ft6 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, 8th Safar, 1546 To The H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain• Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith the new Budget for the year 1546 together with the annual returns and explanatory notes showing ^particulars of revenue and expenditure for 1345. The Budget. 1346 . The Budget is, as usual, on an extremely conservative basis. The receipts are estimated low ana the expenditure is estimated high. Last year a revenue of Hs 7,50,000/'* was estimated lor ^ Customs Receipts which actually amounted to ite 9,62,051/-, therefore for the new year I have estimated Customs Receipts at Ks 8,50,000/-. Last year was admittedly a very poor year owing to a bad pearl season. ihis year the pearl season is, so far, setter than it has been for the last three years. It can be safely expected that trade will improve to a corresponding extent. At torn the same time a margin of one lakh, as against last yyear 1 s actuals, has been allowed in the estimated revenue to cover any unforseen falling off.-2 The only other considerable difference between the estimated revenue for 1345 and 1346 is a decxease of 13,000/- from rents of Government Lands etc., owing to the restoration to the Dawasir of their property which was previously let by the Government. I would point out that the annual revenue, apart from Gash Loans, assets etc. as estimated in the Budget,is about &amp; 9,19,646/-. Expenditure . The first and heaviest item on the expenditure side is allowances to the Ruling Family, which amounts to 4,69,344/- that is more than half the estimated total of the annual Revenue. The amount appears, in my opinion, to be excessively large but constant requests have been made by H .E.Shaikh Hamad, ever since I have been here that it should be increased. At the time that the scale of allowances was laid down, fiome four years ago, it was stated that the auale was liable to revision. 1 beg to suggest tbat the time has come for a revision to be made and that this revision sho Id consist of a reduction. 1 am writing separately on this subject. II. BST.ABLISK'iSHTS This covers the various departments of the Government. Secretariat consists of the Office of the Adviser, Land Department includes the coot of the Survey which is not yet completed owing to delay caused by illneon of the surveyors. Judicial department consists of thethe rarious courts..- 1. The Bahrain Court, (The Adviser and Shaikh Salman Bin Hamad, eldest son of Shaikh Hamad) 2. Petty Court. (The Assistant Adviser and a shaikh of the ruling family and a persian notable on behalf of the Political Agency. 3. The Shia and Sunni Shura Courts. 4. The Diving Court. Item IV . A municipality has now been instituted in Maharaq on the same lines as the one in Manama and the Government contributes Rs. 2000/- monthly tov/ards its expenditure. B. VIII . Tv/o lacs have been set aside for the contemplated installation of Electric and . Light e£/the proposed road between Maharaq and Manama. A Reserve Fund i^being started by setting aside two lacs. Previously the State had no Reserve Fund. Item XIII . A quarter of a lac has been set aside for agriculture. The digging of a well in the centre of the island was contemplated but as many of the present wells^ constructed at very great expense,are x^apidly drying up, this expenditure is doubtful. The recurrent annual expenditure corresponds almost exactly to the estimated annual revenue. The assets on hand from 1345 have been allocated to the reserve and to the various extra-ordinary public works etc.-4- btatements of Re venue and Expenditur e for 1345* The enclosed figures show particulars of Revenue and Expenditure for 1345. Considering that the year was a bad one the revenue results seem satisfactory, y There was an increase of Rs. 79,147/- in Customs Receipts over the previous year. y There was a decrease of Hs 43,795/- in other revenue which can 'be accounted for, and which is explained in my notes, over the previous year. The nett result is an increase of Rs. 54,253/- from regular annual revenue sources over the previous year. This does not include amounts realised by royalty on oil concession and sales of Government Land, which naturally, cannot be counted upon as recurring every year. The balance of State Funds at the end of 1345 was Ks. 5,43,544. At the end of 1344 the balance was fis 9,03,448/- but this included the Deposit Account, ✓ Rs. 3,59,684/- which was not ^ real asset, as it consisted mainly of money held in trust by the ytate which was subsequently paid out by the State during 1345. The expenditure for 1345 of Hs. 17,65,434/- would appear to be extremely large considering that the estimated revenue for 1345 was only Hs 8,35,065/-. It will be seen though that during the year 1345 the State paid off the final balances for thethe large pablic works and schemes entered into during the previous year, such as the water supply. Sea Road, Palace and Offices, and also the State paid out all the money which it held in trust for the public so that at the beginning 1346 it has no liabilities such as building contracts etc. and all the funds shown in the Budget are the actual cash assets and real property of the Sta.te. The financial position is of the State/therefore considerably better at the beginning of this year than it was at the beginning of 1345• It is a curious fact that the balance at the end of 1345 is only Hs 120/- less than the balance at the end of 1344 after deducting ihe deposit account. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Obedient Servant, Financial Adviser, H. Bahrain State.Notes on Revenue Comparison. tH&lt;\ 1. Customs. There is an increase of Hs. 79,147 over the actual receipts for 1344. The Customs show a general Increase on all imports the most oonspiouous heing as follows.- I n crease over 1344 to Eioe •Rs. 32,000 Wheat 1,300 nearest hundreaWw. flour 2,500 Sugar 8,500 Loaf sugar 6,000 mm Ooffee 24 t 000 Tea 16.500 Considering that the pearl season daring 1344 was admittedly a poor one, this increase is very satisfactory. The increase under sugar and tea has nossihly some oonnection with the Increased taxes on these coraraodities in Persia. : 2. Motor Licenses . An axtention of the time allowed for paying these licenses was made at the end of 1345 according to which the licenses for 1346 fall due on the end of Maharara 46, and therefore only a few are included in 1345. SSSjiS.* Owing to the 'badness of the pearl catch and the poor' dnte harvest in 1344 the «uler granted a 20j{ reduction from the leases of all dategardens. Tftls, and the sales of ■ yarious gardens which previously belonged to the Government, r have resulted in a smaller revenue during 1345. Ahout half of the dategardens 'belonged previously to the Dawasir, and ■ have now been returned to them which result in a further decrease of revenue in 1346. 4. Judicial Receipts. The total receipts under this head | are made up as follows. 1. Oourtfees and Fines Rs. 22,Q94 2. Land Registration fees 1,973 3. Stamps on Leases of Bategardens 2,363 | The total increase over 1344 is Rs. 8,050/-, which Is due I mainly to the ever increasing amount of litigation. 5. Miscellaneous . This Item includes sale of certain surplus : 'building material. I have not shown a comparison between the Revenue of 1345 and the Estimated revenue of 23 45 because, as/previously stated, the estimated revenue was made on such an extremely conservative ^asis. The total estimated real revenue for 1345 was Rs. 8,50,978/-. The actual revenue amounted to Rs. 11,39,818/- apart from such items as amalgamation of accounts and deposit accounts, which shows an Increase of Rs. 2,88,840/- over the estimated.Hoteg on Bx^ondltoi© for 1345.

Dated, 12th Safar. 1346. To. H.B.M's Political Agent. Bahrain. Sir. . V /ith reference to my 105/21 of 8th Safar 1346, enclosing the Budget for 1346, I have the honour to draw your attention to the Expenditure under item 1. Allowances to the Ruling Family. F The aanual revenue of the State is estimated at Rs 9,19,646. The annual amount paid in allowances is Rs4 / 69 / 344, more than half the revenue. I venture to suggest that this amount is excessive, in proportion to the revenue, even if this yea^s revenue exceeds the estimated amount. At the time that the scale of allowances etc.' was laid down, some four years ago, it was agreed that they were subject to a revision. I suggest that the time for revision has arrived and that the revision should 'be in the nature of a reduction Some time ago I was provided with a copy of the Muscat Civil List in order that it might assist me in the matter of determining the allowances. I am not fully acquainted with the financial affairs of Muscat hut I believe the annual revenue of the Sultanate^ exceeds that of Bahrain by about three lacs. The Civil List of Muscat, including the allowance of the Sultan, appears to be more* than two lacs less than the Bahrain Civil List. fl The Sultan of Muscat, I believe, receives Rs.10,000 per men^B The Deputy Ruler of Bahrain receives Rs.12500/ per month. This, f^ him, is not excessive as heavy calls are made upon his charity anA he is naturally expected to entertain and to keep up a certain st *e compatible with his position. As is the custom with Arab rulers he dispenses large sums every month in presents to Arabs who visit Bahrain from the mainland and elsewhere. His financial position is at present thoroughly sound, he owes nothing and has a respectable bank balance, but if his salary were reduced I think it would be difficult to keep him out of debt. I am aware of his private money affairs as since coming here, at his own request, i have undertaken the control of his private income and his gardens and properties. Shaikh Abdulla bin isa, youngest of the three brothers, is in receipt of a salary of Rs.6,000 per month. Lately he has been ■taking a decided part in the general administration^ of the State, [but his allowance, in my opinion, is more than it should be. iALii Nadir Vaisul, brother of the Sultan of Muscat, who I believe acts for the Sultan during the greater part of the year, receives Rs 2,500. I suggest that Rs.3000. is sufficent for Shaikh Abdulla, considering that he is a large landowner having been given a great deal of property by his father Shaikh Isa, who's favourite son he is. The elder brother, Shaikh Mohamed, takes no part in public affairs, fygra? owing to indifferent health and inclination. He receives Rs 3000. per month. He also is a large landowner and squeezes every possible rupee out of his tenants. I suggest that ^s.2000 would be sufficent for him. Both these shaikhs have sons are in receipt of salaries. ' v.2. I also suggest a reduction of 10% on the salaries of 18 sonSf nephews, uncles and relations of Shaikh Hamed^ who draw monthly amounts between R3 .6OO and Rs 200.each, and a reduction 0 f 5fo on the salaries of 10 other relatives who draw 'between ^s»100 and Rs. 150 each* Thes J^ i i^ ductions would result in an increase to the State's finances 1)i7 Rs « 1,3500 per annum. With the exception of Shaikh AMulla and three or four junior Shaikhlings none of the Ruling Family take any part , or apparently a ny interest, in public affairs. Those few who act as magistrates or hold some public position have only been persuaded to do so with % much difficulty and by the inducement of additional emoluments which • a re usually absurdly high. Most of the Ruling family are practically illiterate and this, combined with their excessive dislike of any ^ sort of workjinakes it difficult to place them in those positians which they ought to fill. The allowances paid by the Ruling Shaikh to the lesser members of the Khalifa family were perhaps originally made xnxa: in order to ensure that they should support him with their armed retainers. In former times this was very necessary. Now-a-days none of the Shaikhs have any retainers worth considering but public security is ensured by the State Police and a large force of armed local watchmen who are paid for out of the public revenue. I have lately discussed the question of allowances with Shaikh Hained, in connection with his suggestion that the Civil List should be increased in order to include and to raise various salaries. I pointed out that it is already too large and that the only possible method of making the payments that he wished was by cutting down some others. He himself considers, for instance, that Shaikh Abdullah salary is out of proportion to the others but I am perfect certain that he would never suggest cutting it down himself unless it was suggested to him by you, officially, in which case he would be able to tell Shaikh Abdulla that he had made the reduction on your recommendation. After a year and a half in Bahrain I have acquired a certain amount of information as to the financial position of the Khalifa family and I am confident that such a reduction in their allowances as I have suggested would not seriously injure them, although undoubtedly they would receive it with unanimous and intense disapproval. I have the honour to be Sir Your obedient servant. Adviser Bahrain State.Ho,0/93 of 1^27. H.B.M*g Political ^HS®ncy, Bakr«in,20tk 1927. From Captain H.G.^ban, Political Agent, Baiirein, To Tko HonSbit Liaut-Colonel L.B.H.Kawortk rolitical R«3id«jat in th« Ptraian Gulf B U S H I R E. Sir, I havt tke konour to forward ii«r«witja tli« ntw Bud- gat for th® year 1346 together with attacked explanatory notes by the iidviser to the Government of Bahrein. Ag will 'be noticed on peruaal, the finances of Bahrein- are in a most satisfactory condition and the estimated re current expenditure is within the estimated revenue, the actual revenue will, however, undoubtedly be much more than the estimate while the expenditure will not change. Th^re is also a suijfttantial amount of money on h^nd to allow for schemes, public works etc., still leaving Rs.2 lacs in deposit as a reserve fund. There are still improve ments in the matter of increased efficiency in the educa tion system and agricultural experiments which are very desirable and are being carried out on &amp; small scale but any serious effort in this direction is impossible until further econoiaiao are effected on the expenaiture side wnic/' is still much too great. On inning to page 7 of the Budget it will be noticed that out of the total recurring expenditure of about Rs. H lacs nearly Rs.5 lacs are spent on the Civil List and Allowances of the Ruling; aculy, this am unt is excessive, far more than is paid in Muscat State, most of the reci pients are in possession of large date gardens seized 03*i-eriginally fron the Bahrani owners wui are in addition lazy iadis«nt -and ignorant of and unwilling to learn any aort of trad® to support themselves.

The first monthly balance sheets, drawn up by Daly in December 1923, are enclosed (folios 32-38).A large portion of the file is made up of monthly accounts sheets (including Bahrain civil lists), sent by Eastern Bank Limited to the Political Agent (January 1924 accounts at folios 46-58, and subsequent months distributed throughout the volume). Correspondence from Claude de Grenier, Director of the Bahrain Customs House, enclosing customs house receipts and expenditure also figure prominently (for example, folios 80-81, 98-100). Notes on the annual Bahrain state budget for the Hijri years 1343 to 1346 (1924-1927), with balance sheets prepared by Daly (and later, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave) are also included in the file (folios 104-13, 187-90, 196-206, 231-46).The file also contains correspondence from Prideaux to the Secretary of the Political Department at the India Office in Whitehall, dated 15 September 1925, indicating that Prideaux has found a man (Belgrave) qualified to work as a financial advisor to the Government of Bahrain (folios 168-69, 172B-175).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Bank Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Customs House, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Customs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>State budget</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Political reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Law reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00035f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
