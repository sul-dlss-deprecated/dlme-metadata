Ty’A WITH reference to my despatch No. 169 of the 4th April, 1932, and to ^ paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 273 o£~~tE’e 3rd June last, regarding the organisation by the International Sleeping Car Company of a through service to Europe via Nisibin and Istanbul, I have the honour to report that Mr. Chaker has recently paid a flying visit to Tehran and has given me a little interesting information. 2. His company will shortly put on the Tehran-Khanikin section big six-wheeler cars, which will be imported free of the obligation (mentioned in the sub-enclosure to your despatch No. 493 of the 30th November) to buy dollar exchange and also from the obligation to purchase an export certificate, thus saving the company some £3,000. 3. I asked Mr. Chaker how he accomplished this miracle, and he told me that it was thanks to Feroughi “ letting the cat out of the bag last year.” The millenary of the birth of the Persian poet Firdausi will be celebrated ceremoniously at Meshed next year and some 200 foreign guests will be invited; the Shah is determined that they shall be properly accommodated in the towns where they have to spend a night, and realised that foreign help must be invoked. The rest was easy, as Mr. Chaker said that he was prepared to run, but not to own, hotels built to his plans, provided it was made financially possible for him to import his new cars. 4 . It is a good example of the universal sweep of the Imperial broom. 5 . I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 106). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. [15 b 9].

During this week for example, not ona letter or newspaper was received from the United Kingdom in this office until this morning, when a very largo mail came in. Letters marked 'orient Express' are taking up to eleven days from the date cf posting to arrive here. Complaints hove reached me from business people, who state that the service was much better before the war than it has been since, and they beg that the matter be looked into. My American colleague has just remarked that he has always been a subscriber to the 'Times' of London, but that as he is now receiving six copies of the 'Times' and a copy of the 'Observer' in one bunch weekly, he feels that ha is wasting money. 2. The outward service is in strong contrast to the homeward, which reported to have improved, letters being de livered in tiie north of England on the sixth morning after posting hare.

Sir, With reference to your letters of the 13th and 21st of April, tr ansmitting a copy of despatches from His Majesty*s Consul at Aleppo and His majesty’s Consul 1 General at Beirut, concerning the mail service to Syria, I am directed by the Postmaster General to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, that the question of despatching mails from this Country to Syria (and also to Iraq and certain parts of Persia) by the Simplon Orient Express to Istanbul, and thence by Taurus Express from Haydarpasa has been under consideration for some time past, and, in view of the considerable acceleration offered, it has been decided to make use of the service beginning on Wednesday the 25th May* The mails for Syria will be despatched from London by this route every Wednesday morning, Friday morning and Saturday evening, while mails for Iraq and Persia (Abadan, Mohammerah and isushire) will be despatched every .Wednesday and Friday morning. An i^r^ary of the services is enclosed for your information. As regards the suggested use of the French air mail service for correspondence posted in this country for Syria, I am to say that, owing to the charges made by the French Post Office for the use of this service, it would be necessary to charge the public a rate of postage more than double that charged for the present service via Imperial Airways. In these circumstances, and having regard to the excellent ordinary service referred to above, there would be little or The Under Secretary of State, foreign office.or no demand on the part of posters in this country to use the air service in question and it is not therefore . f proposed to make it available for correspondence posted in this country.

H✓-vi i 4-^ -i- ^ ✓ 1 i it ,r i i . ■« f by road and rail between Tehran and Nisibin. * 2 . 1 enclose a copy of a notice^) issued by Mr. Chaker, from which it will oe seen that the journey between Tehran and Khaniqin is to be accomplished in two days and the journey between Tehran and London in nine and a half days. The accomplishment of the journey between Tehran and Kermanshah in a single stage sounds a formidable undertaking, but Mr. Chaker assures me that it can be done with ease and comfort. He does not intend to book more than three passengers in any one car, except in the case of families. 3. Full details of fares have not yet been issued, but I understand that a first-class ticket from Tehran to London will cost £80, including sleeping-car accommodation and meals on the trains. The fare from Khaniqin to Tehran will be £10 (gold) and from Tehran to Khaniqin £6 (gold). Luggage will be Qd. per kilog., without any free allowance, and the cost of food and lodging on the journey will be between 10 s. and 15s. Making all allowances for luggage, food and lodging and the cost of the railway journey from Khaniqin to Bagdad, the new service appears to be distinctly cheaper than the defunct Junkers air service, which charged 75 United States dollars for a place between Tehran and Bagdad. 4. It will be noted that the new service will not be maintained during July and August and December, January and February. The motor cars will, nevertheless, be available for hire during these months, at a cost of £18 for the journey between Tehran and Khaniqin (£36 for the round trip). 5. Mr. Chaker informs me that he has had to abandon, for the present at any rate, a scheme wdiich his company had in mind for the establishment of first-class hotels in Tehran and along the route, mainly on account of the obstacles in the way of the possession of real property by foreign companies. The company will no doubt use their influence to improve the standard of the existing hotels, a point which is of importance in view of the fact that the main object of the company is to increase their earnings on the railways in Europe and Asia Minor by rendering it easier for tourists and others to visit Persia, For tbis rpnsnn the fares between Tehran and Nisibin have been fixed on a cost basis I have, &amp;c.

New Auto-Routidre services are to be developed, notably a daily one to Alexandretta via Antioch. 7o During the past year much work lias been done on. the Aleppo-Deir-ftz-Zor road, which for the first time was passable throughout the winter, though it cannot yet I think be considered proof against a really rainy season. This road will probably be developed in the near future. 8, Since the completion cf the bridge over the Euphrates at Deir-Ez-Zor, the Bozanti-Alep-Nissibin and Prolongements has suffered much from the competition of lorries which transport goods to the Duck's Phil via Deir-Ez-Zor and Hassetoh^ at rates uns rochable by the railway company.
