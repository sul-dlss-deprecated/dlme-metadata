U.S. of S. Secretary of State DRAFT Letter D.A. Brugger, &amp;=&gt;&lt;* 60 Braemar Averse, Wimbledon Park, S.W.19. Further action. Printing. / ( now been informed by the General Post Office thatj since your letter of 6th September^ 1944 is known to have been delivered at Kuwait the matter is one for settlement between yourself and the addressee. It is regretted that this fact was not appreciated when a letter was sent to you from this Office on the 6th October. In 1944 the Post Office at Kuwait was under the control of the Government of India, &amp; is noted that you are in direct touch with the postal authorities of the successor (Government of Pakistan. These are the authorities most likely to be able to help you in your enquiries. The matter is not one for the United Kingdom Government and not, I am afraid^one in which the United Kingdom authorities could intervene. It is appreciated that you must feel it very unsatisfactory to experience such difficulty in establishing what happened to the remittance of 3/7d which you sent to Kuwait. We think that you should know^ however^ that^ particularly in view of the various changes which have taken place in recent years in the administration of the Post Office at Kuwait^*that it seems to us unlikely that it would be possible'! at this date to trace records on a matter of this There is also the possibility that A kinda reply to your letter was lost by enen^y C action. I am sorry not to be able to send you a more helpful reply. Yours faithfully. K. R. CROOK(88008) Wt.48996/110 30,000 4/49 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 y C.R.O. Mr....C£QoJ 5 ..

It is regretted that this fact was not previously appreciated. I We observe that you have been in touch with the British postal authorities both in India prior to 15th August, 1947, and since that date in the new Dominion of Pakistan. The matter is one which exclusively concerns these authorities and, after careful consideration, we have come to the conclusion that this Office is not able to render you any assistance in communicating with them. It occurs to us that it is most unlikely that after this lapse of time, and in view of the changes in administration of Post Offices in the Persian Gulf area which have taken place in the 1 - . __ _ n ^ » /' i.. ^^ s , TJLi meantime, there would remain any record of receipt -A*-—— of your letter of September 1944* We have been informed in other connections that many postal records in the area have been lost. Nor, we feel, could the Postmaster who was in Kuwait at the ^ r _ ft V W ' fi- W.. —.''V. .^1 w ' ‘ time, be expected to have any recollection of the matter. Furthermore, we do not think /theUtfMI Q - , the possibility be excluded that a reply was actually sent to you at the time, but was lost by reason of war-time conditions. In all these circumstances we feel, with regret, that we can only advise you to allow the matter to rest. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,M JFH.

Jlevomber, 19 49* With reference to your letter the ^th of October, and enclosure, concerning a complaint from Mr* D. A# Brugger of 60, Braemar Avenue, Wimbledon Park, S.W. 19, of the non-receipt of postage stamps ordered by him on the 6th of September, 1944 from the Postmaster of Kuwait, I now enclose copies of the letter sent to Mr, Brugger on the 21st of October and his reply. As the letter ordering the stamps was delivered ? the matter is one for settlement between the sender and addressee, but as the latter was a Postmaster who never came under British control the Indian or Pakistan postal administration should answer/for him. I am sorry that we have been unable to satisfy Mr. Brugger. As agreed on the telephone we have simply acknowledged receipt of his letter. Yours sincerely. (d. McLaren) K. R.

Dear Sir, I thank you for your letter of date 21st October, 1949* I am already aware that this matter is not a matter for the General Post Office, London, E.C.I., and under no circumstances should my letter have been forwarded to you as (l) Registered item No. 2029 was delivered on 3rd November, 1944. (2) Prior to 1st April, 1948, postal administration of Kuwait was under the authority of India thence Pakistan . My complaint is proper to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, London, S.W.l. (at ref. Est. 8327/49)* - No other government department is remotely connected with my conplaintl My complaint is that I have written repeatedly to the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan Circle, Karachi, Pakistan, who has issued a stereotyped form of acknowledgement at date of 8th September, 1948. He has ignored my later communications• The High Commissioner of Pakistan is unable to assist in the matter (why, I don*t know!) at date - 14th May, 1949 (ref. G.73*^fJ* If these offices cannot help me, who can ! ; I regard the attempt of the Secretary of State, S.W.l., who forwarded my original letter of 28th September, 1949, to your office, as a deliberate attempt to evade^responsibility and a clear case of trying to'dodge the issue’and'passing back* to another government department who is fully aware that it is not in the least connected with an inefficient and slack postal administration. Perhaps you would convey my sentiments to the Secretary of State, S.W.l., and your remarks as in the essence of your letter of 21st October, 1949 * /Ifi If I do not get a satisfactory reply from the Secretary of State, I shall have no alternative but to complain to ray Member of radiament, stating the above facts as I find them* I shall shortly write to the Secretary of State, Commonwealth Relations Office, stating that I expect satisfaction from their o±fice, and in all probability, they will shortly receive a reply from the Postal Services Department, General Post Office, London, E.C.l* .
