C/2/57 i^ear Sirs, Certain consumers have installed, and are installing air conditioning plant in Manamah. The demand for this type of plant is expected to increase, and it would help the Government considerably if it could obtain some idea of what future requirements will be. If you are interested in this subject we would suggest that before ordering, you get in touch with us with a view to standardising the A.C.units. The question of service and maintenance, in this part of the world, is made a much easier problem if machines are standardised, and all parts are interchangeable. Another reason why the Government would like to know future requirements, is that if a sufficient number of units are installed, it will be possible to create a special rate for 'air conditioning' as is done in the case of heating, Units at present being installed by the Government are manufactured by 'J^rigidaire Ltd.'.

Probably a figure of Ss.4 ,000 per room-would be a fair average, assuming rooms comparable in siz,e with those in Indian houses. The figure mentioned is intended to cover all initial costs.

It appears that the central installation v.oijld be cheaper in the long run but that it is liKely to take more time to obtain than the portable sets which are apparently hfild in stock in India. I think therefore that we should (a) ask for tenders for supplying a central air- conditioning plant for the whole Agency and (b) ma±te an estimate ourselves if possible of the cost of installing the requisite number of portable units in the various offices. 3. The number of rooms required to be air conditioned are: Upstairs Drawing Room P.A* s Confidential Office Clerks* Confidential Office Third Bedroom Downstairs P.A*s Court Room HeadciQrk*s Office Lnglisn Office (one large room with small room adjoining; one unit should suffice) Arabic Office A.P.A»s Office, bfts VkW- )vvu-• The Indian Assistant*s block does not require at present to be air conditioned as it is one of the coolest buildings we nave.

W-l Political Agent, Bahrain. Llemorandum: Proposed /.C.units for the Political Agency,Bahrain. I enlose a rough statement shov/ing the approximate cost of installing eleven portable ,4 ton, water-cooled air conditioning units in certain rooms of the Agency, as follows Upstairs Drawing Room P.A* s Confidential Office Clerks Confidential Office Third Bedroom 3 Units I I ' I Downstairs P*A f s Court Room Eeadclerk's Office 2 I I I I n ii English Office Arabic Office a.P.A's Office ti ti n The costs are based on the present day prices of 'Frigidaire' units, exactly similar to those now in use in the Agency. Other makes would be compe titive. It would be advisable to lower the ceilings of the Drawing Room and Court Roon temporarily, (by means of light ceiling boards or similar material) and to en large the present pump house to take the new pumps. With regard to current consumption, this entirely depends on the hours the units are run, but each unit taices approximately one unit of electricity per hour. rom the 'sliding Scale of Charges u , enclosed herewith it will be seen that, running normally, the one anna per unit rate would soon be reached.THE BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT ELECTRIC SUPPLY DEPT. ”S' Thus: if eleven units work ten hours a day, then II X 10 X I » 110 units = Rs. 6/l4/-per day or Rs. 206/4/-per month. If A.C.units are used fans would not be neces sary. Eleven fans would consume approximately one unit per hour or say, 300 units per month = 300 units X 7 annas = Rs.I3l/4/-. The price given in the report mentioned of Rs.4000/- for air conditioning one room is rather high, even allowing for war prices. I have allowed Rs.I000/-for spares, and it may be assumed that, these would be used, normally , to the value of Rs.500/-per annum for eleven machines and the pumps. I agree that a centrally operated compressor plant would be a cheaper, and more economical proposition, but difficulty would be ex perienced in obtaining such a plant in time for operation this summer (1941). Delivery of portable units from America in the timeavailable would be somewhat uncertain, but possibly the India Stores Departments might be able to procure eleven units ex-India. If they are obtainable, and the price is right, it would be preferable to get 'Frigidaire' units, as this make is used almost entirely in Bahrain. I am preparing a specification for a central plant and asking for tenders from the following firms:- 'Frigidaire” (^merica) I.E.Hall (England) General Electric (England) Remington (America) Please let me know if you from any other manufacturers ci Government of Bahrainf I zl^ STAmiENT SHOWING APPROXIMATE GOST OF INSTALLING ELEVEN POOTilBLE AIR CONDI TIONING UTTITS IN THE POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN.

I now have pleasure in submitting an approximate estimate for installing fifteen water-rcooled 'Remington' Model 48 Portable Air Conditioners in the Muscat Agency. The units are similar to those now on order for the Bahrain Government. I am una£l&amp;, to get prices for water-cooled units from other makers‘as Frigidaire, The General Electric Co, etc., at the moment, but expect prices from America in due course. They will be competitive. The American manufacturers are largely occupied on munition work, and many of them have discontinued manufacturing A.C.units, for the time being. I attach copies of some quotations received for air-cooled units, but I am not prepared to recommend them for use in such climates as Bahrain and Muscat; as my experience of these units (in Bahrain) gives me as yet no confidence in them. Various makers assure me that they can now produce an air-cooled unit which will be efficient in all climates, and the Remington people are sending a sample model for trial in Bahrain, during the coming hot v/eather. I should like to mention that the prices given are very approximate owing to the uncertainty of freight rates. I am informed by Messrs. Gray Mackenzie that a 30/&lt;i advance on all B.I.freights will be made shortly, and further increases are expected, as time goes on. State Engineer, Government of Bahrain.

At our rates of depreciation, i.e. a life of six years (depreciation on diminishing value) it would now stand in the books at Rs.451/5/-. The Bahrain Petroleum Company 1 s committee, however, give it a life of eight years (depreciation on direct value), so it stands in the books at Rs.589/8/-. It is my personal opinion that this machine is now under depreciated; this applies, as well, to most of the plant and machinery under the new arrangement, but, as we have adopted the recomraendations of the committee in this respect, it must be assumed that the present sale price of the unit is Rs.589/8/-.

Would you please refer to the correspondence ending with your telegram No.135 A.C., dated the 6th June 1941, regarding air-conditioning? 2. On the strength of hay’s demi-official letter No.P.175-A/40, dated the 7th September 1940, all the Agencies have produced most elaborate estimates in the hopes that something would be done about air-conditioning. I should be grateful if you could give me some idea of when the Government of India are likely to be able to proceed with the matter. It will be a great disappoint ment if nothing can be done, especially in places like Bahrain where it is in such common use elsewhere.

Would you please refer to your demi-official letter No.723-13/258, dated the 17th June 1941? 2. I am desired to say that though there is sufficient personal experience here of Gulf conditions to evoke the most complete sympathy with your desire to obtain air-condi- tioning for the Gulf Agencies, we are up against two obstacles which at this stage of the war* are quite insuperable. The first is the matter of funds which become more and more difficult to obtain as war expenditure expands; and the second is that air-conditioning plant has to be obtained from the United States of America and consequently involves inroads on India’s very severely restricted dollar exchange. It is not due to any lack of appreciation of the value ot air-conditioning to Gulf posts that the question has had to be postponed till better times. 't— No. f7^-13/258.

Gare, therefore, should be taken of units The following suggestions may help j to keep you cool all the summer:- 1. Do not overwork your unit. Give it at least eight hours rest in twenty!our. 2. See that the water is turned on and known to be passing through the unit before it is switched on. 3. Have each running unit serviced at least once a month. 4. The houses in Bahrain have not been designed for air conditioning, and it is not possible, in the majority of cases, to obtain low wall temperatures without overworking the machine. A wall temperature, however, of 86/7°F (dry bulb) with dehumidified air, is comfortable. Low room temperatures are not recommended by physicians,in this climate. 5. Stop all air infiltration from windows, doors, etc. as far as possible. 6. Do not place anything on the top of the cabinet.

I was surprised to find on my last visit that the air-conditioning machines had been removed, but that the air space had still been left in its diminished extent. 2. I do not know what has happened to the machines, but I think it is a great pity that the main office is no longer air-conditioned, and the serious amount of ill-health in the Bahrain Agency last, year is, in my opinion, almost certainly due to it. I should like to make it clear, however, if one of the machines is that which has been installed in the little bath room I use as an office that I have no desire whatever to be air-conditioned at the expense of your staff and would be glad if it could be returned to them. If it is not possible for any particular reason to air-condition the whole office then the best plan would be to restore the cubic area to its original dimensions. E. B.

We intend taking up the matter again. The intention is that when the war situation is easier and if the funds can be made available, a contract may be placed with an Air Conditioning Firm in India for the supply of the requisite number of plants to you and that the importing flra will be granted an import licence. It is expected that when the manufacturers of the air conditioning equipment in the United States of America are allowed to change over from the war production to peace production, there will be a heavy demand on them for such equipment, and therefore the sooner a contract is placed in the United States of America the better. 3. I am desired to request that the Government of TivHn may be furnished with information as to the des cription and number of the buildings in which it is considered essential to instal the air conditioning plants and the number of plants required. On the supply of the plants it will presumably be possible for the Mechanic-in-Charge of the Work-shop of the Persian Gulf Independent Sub-Division to instal them in the various buildings; but the Government of India would like to know whether the maintenance of the plants will necessitate the engagement of any extra mechanics, and if so, what the cost involved will be.

Though the correspondence about spare parts for the Agency air-conditioners started nearly two years ago, and the summer is now upon us we do not seem to get any further and the last telegram from General Motors (quoted in the enclosure to your memorandum No.PA/2/64 dated the 1st May, 1945) is unsatisfactory and its meaning (to me) obscure. What do they mean by the 'portion” of the order and the 'balance material? Your memorandum says (1) a new expansion valve and (2) ^s are required for the frigidaires. Are these all that are required? Are they with the 'portion' or the 'balance material'? Can you find out what is hold ing them up? If it is want of shipping space I can help. There is a large cylinder which Hickinbotham told me was Freon gas in the back verandah of the Agency. Perhaps you could send one of your men to examine it and, if it is the gas, you may be able to get at least one of the frigidaires going. Yours sincerely, Group Captain H.P.G.

Dear Sir, Please refer-^o your letter of 19th August 1946, reference D.O. No.2711-18/14, concerning the A.C. Unit installed by the Company which has been giving difficulty. An inspection of the installation by Mr. Andresen together with our electrical foreman in dicates that the trouble with the unit is caused by fuses installed by the Government power department. The main difficulty with the cutting- out of the Unit is the local Government power supply, wherein insufficient capacity is available to maintain the proper voltage required for the equipment. The equipment will actually operate with considerable -under- voltage, but the Government electrical supply appears to be so badly overloaded that the voltage drops to an excessively low value causing the fuses to disrupt the current. We suggest that the Government install larger fuses in an effort to permit the equipment to r continue working without the many small interruptions caused by inadequate sized fuses. This will assist to a great extent, but will not overcome the inherent main difficulty wherein the power supply voltage is insufficient to carry the connected load.

Political Agent, The Political Agency, BAHREIN, AIR COOLING BAHREIN POLITICA L AGENCY BUILDING File 216 ~ q £ \ A Dear Sir, In response to your letter No* 2826-18/14 regarding the cost of extending the air cooling to the upstairs rooms and more offices in the Agency, our Engineering Department have made a preliminary study and rough estimate of costs for your information. The existing 5 ton unit with which you now cool three rooms is not large enough to cool any more rooms and it appears that the best plan would be to install two 20 ton units, one on each side of the Agency, with a cold air and return air duct system to and from each room to be cooled. The existing 5 ton unit would not be required. One 40 ton unit would require long, difficult and expensive return air ducts and is not considered as suitable as two units. I am returning herewith the two blueprints of the upstairs and downstairs plan of the Agency on which we have indicated a possible duct system for two 20 ton units. The cold air ducts to the rooms are marked in red and the wannair return ducts to the units are marked in green. This system is, of course, only a preliminary suggestion and must be subject to further study by you or whoever engineers the installation of the additional air cooling. Based on approximately equivalent ceiling heights the units would cool the following rooms : Unit I Downst airs P.A*s Office 30 x 20 -f Office / ^ 20 x 13 Upstairs Bedroom 11 x 10 4 Office 20 x 13 Drawing Room 30 x 20 Total, 600 sq. ft. 260 M H 110 “ ' 260 w ' 600 * 1830 ” Mrv 'ZZZL PA-976 .

The E.O. were consulted before the transfer was made and I was given no indication that they were sorry to see H. go. 2. In the summer of 1941 we had two units downstairs:- (a) the water cooled unit now in the little room used by the P.R. as an office, which was in the main English Office, where three clerks including the Head Clerk used to work; (b) another water cooled unit, hired for the season and located in the room normally (and at present) used by the Head Clerk but then used by the A.P.A. as his office. 3. wyuld be the last person to deny the very great benefitsjberived from air conditioning, particularly at night, but I am constrained to question the opinion expres sed in paragraph 2 of p.u.c. that ,f the serious amount of ill- health in the Bahrain Agency last year was... almost certain- ly due” to the fact thatjthree of our 11 clerks who work in the English Office, or the 4 who might at a pinch Wbrk there,VvGis d.Gpi’ivGcl Ox air conclit»ioning fop five op six houps a day out of the 24 during the summep months.

The clerks who hoi^been ill in this Agency since X came here are Messrs. Sharma, Zafar Islam, Hahmatullah, Aranha and Abdur Rahman. Of these, (a) Mr._ Sharma* s office is the co olest in the Agency in the summer and he would not in any casejderive^enefit from the reinstallation of an air conditioner in the English Office. I do not think that his nervous complaints can be ascribed to ^he absence of air conditioning5 to 6 hours a day in the summer months. (b) Mr. Zafar Islam was a chronic sufferer from piles, which were finally operated upon last winter. This v/as, so far as I am aware, his only complaint. (c) Mr. Rahmatullah . I understand, was a chronic sufferer from malaria. He was not here in the summer of 1941, so I cannot say whether he would have suffered any less from it had Khorramshahr. He was suffering from asthma when he arrived here and left on leave in May. 4. In view of paragraph 2 of p.u.c. the air conditioner at present in the P.R f s office had better be returned to the English Office. I do not think that it will be possible for its benefits to be enjoyed by any one other than the English Office / including the Head Clerk — four in all. ' ne hardest worked member of our establishment and the one who has had the longest (off and on) in Bahrain is Mr. najagopalan, but I am afraid that irf any case it will not be possible for him to be air conditioned -- though he couldwork in the English Office in the afternoor**when necessary if he like 4 it. Of the 4 clerks wk&gt; work in the English who Office, Mr. Rabbani, the Passport Clerk,/is perpetually on the move and spends about two hours every day in the separate passport office, dot s not like air conditioning as it involves his getting hot and cold alternately and might therefore well prove a menace to his health. For the rest, I think they would like it and so long as the doors were kept shut and there were not too many comings and going^ it would no doubt be beneficial to their work. /7/43 !L^J&lt;r .

If the drawing-room of the A.P.A.*s house were air-condi tioned as well as the bed-room it would be a great amenity in the event of a future married A.P.A. whose family were here in the summer, as they would have somewhere other than the bed-room to sit during the day.
