J. D. Winnifr ith, E sq # , Treasury, S.W. 1. In ray letter to you of the 20th December I promised to write separately to you about the question of expenditure involved in the transfer of control in the Persian Gulf to,H.M.G. which you raised in your letter N 0 .SI 7497/5 of the 17th December* \ I should like first of all to draw your attention once again to the memorandum circulated under Ext*749^46 on the 1st November, 1946* The Persian Gulf is strategically of extreme importance as being the main undeveloped oil area of the world and as development proceeds its importance will increase rather than diminish* It is essential that British interests in this area should be strongly and securely represented / and IWPWPIfl 'tfw mpimiii fU IlglltFPiV ■and it is therefore likely that expenditure on British representation will need to be increased rather than reduced. Y/hile it is true that the majority of the trade of the area in coiranodities other than oil is with India, the interest of in the oil so far transcedes the interests of the Government of India in the remainder of the THAT trade A -but no reduction in the standard of .representation will be possible on the transfer of control without seriously impairing the adequate protection of the British oil interests. To turn to detail, of the £103,000 at which the annual expenditure in the Gulf is estimated, slightly more than half is disbursed in salaries of officials and establishment and in allowances. It is not possible arbitrarily to alter the terms of pay of personnel in the Gulf, particularly as all the officers belong to the Indian Political /Service/ Service and receive scales of pay laid down for officers of that Service, unless they are transferred immediately to another Service, I understand that the Foreign Office are not willing to do this. with two exceptions noted below, is on office contingencies, touring, postage and telegrams and secret expenditure, and once again it would be impolitic to indulge mentioned are a secret service grant of about £ 2,500 which was placed at the disposal of the Political Resident for use in keeping the Arab States on our side during the waf, the further continuance of which is under consideration; and the Zanzibar subsidy of approximately £ 6,000 The remainder of the expenditure. in hasty economies. The two exceptions /payablepayable by Zanzibar to Muscat under the Canning Award of 1861 (liability for this payment was assumed by H.M.G. in 1871 and since 1883 has been exclusively an Indian * charge). Nearly all the essential services in the Persian Gulf have been set up with British capital and on British initiative and attempts made by neighbouring states to take them over or to supplement them by parallel services have been strenuously resisted by the Foreign Office to maintain British supremacy in the area. The majority of these services are self-supporting (for example the . Post Offices make a profit and the Persian Gulf Lighting Service operates entirely on port dues collected at Basra and Abadan and Contributions from the oil companies) and there /seemsseems to be no reason why they should not be run in the future by or on behalf of H.M.G. as they are at present run by the Government of India. It was very clearly brought out at the meeting held at the India Office on the 6 th November, 19b6 that it was essential to avoid any hiatus in administration, particularly as many problems of considerable compldbeity were ... r TrtAv looming up. We do not contemplate^any additional expenditure will be necessary in 1947-48 but we do feel that to start making economies in that financial year at this notice would mean that the questions must be given inadequate consideration which would involve the risk of action being taken which would jeopardise the position in the Gulf so carefully built up £ 03 ? so many years.Secretary of State. In November last you approved (pink flag) the draft of a Cabinet Memorandum on 'Fuoure Administration and Control of Relations with the Arab States in the Persian Gulf' for circulation via officials in the Departments concerned to those of your colleagues principally affected by the question. Correspondence between officials has been proceeding in the meanwhile and a revised draft Cabinet Memorandum, framed in the light of this correspondence, is now submitted for your approval (green flag). 27 / 12 / 46 .

Could you now please take steps to tnis end? The Secretary of State saw it in tne form at X, since when it has been amended as shown in red anc green ink. The main change has oeen to recommend that effort snould be made to ensure that tne foreign Office definitely takes over control from the India Office on 1st ^pril, 1940, the India Office maintaining control from 1st npril, 1947 to 1st April, Trie Colonial Secretary may try to press at the Cabinet for it to be left opery. that either tne colonial Office or tne foreign Office should ta.ce over from the India Office on 1st April, 1945. Though tnere is something to be said on the Colonial office's sideline feeling here is that it is for the Colonial Office to fight tneir own case if they wont to. The wax of the revised paper is still in existence and could be used for making Cabinet copies if desired.Mr .Dgnaldson Here is the letter we have been expecting from Mr.Caccia. I think it is in accordance with your expectations and that you have already taken account of it. I have signed the letter to Martin, and leave you to wind up the correspondence with Winnifrith. I think that no time should be lost in getting into touch with the Government of Irriia on the subject, as the general situation looks like developing rapidly. I think the Foreign Office will need a good deal of watching as regards the transfer of posts and personnel to their establishments. In justice to the Indian service they ought to accept a full complement of officers of the Indian service into their own service to correspond with the number of posts they are taking over. But they will, I am sure, do their best to make an arrangement which favours their own convenience and the interests of their existing personnel, with the object that either immediately or in the near future a number of posts may be added to their service exceeding the number of outsiders for whom they accept responsibility. I suspect that some idea of this sort may underlie their suggestion that members of the Indian Political Service may have to be taken over on a contract basis for a limited number of years rather than on a career basis.India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.I.

We feel strongly that both these functions should pass as soon as possible to the Foreign Office, and in this letter we assume that such a decision is reached. 3* Turning from principle to practice, as you know we are unable at present to undertake the control of the Gulf posts and we are grateful to the India Office for expressing willingness to assume that responsibility for the time being. We are sure that the transitional stage of control by the India Office will be of advantage, not only to the officers and subordinate staffs of the Gulf posts, but also be of value in assuring efficiency there in future. If the people now in the Gulf were to come immediately under direct Foreign Office control it is possible that their claims to compensation for premature termination of services may be prejudiced. Some of them might not be prepared to take that risk, and so ask for transfers elsewhere, creating vacancies.difficult to fill. On the other hand, if the administration is left in the hands of the India Office, time is afforded to the staff concerned for them to ascertain their compensation terms and consider their future in the light of that knowledge. Such a plan would also enable the Foreign Office to enlarge its field of choice to include officers with experience of the Persian Gulf now serving in India, /who Sir William Croft, K.B.E India Office.

We should therefore be glad if the India Office would take over administrative control of posts in the Persian Gulf, without, however, committing the Foreign Office to the retention of the present staff, whether officers or subordinates. As regards the draft Cabinet Memorandum the only changes which we would want to suggest is that paragraph 6 (a) should be amended to read as follows: 'The India Office should as soon as possible a_p.d as an interim arrangement taKe over from the Government of India direct responsibility for the political posts in the Persian Gulf, and should continue to exercise such responsibility until the Foreign Office is able to assume control . n and that at the end of paragraph 3 we should read 'and to absorb suitable candidates from the staff into the Foreign Service ' I am sending copies of this letter to Winnifrith, Martin and Stock.

( 46 ) 79 th meeting, minute 3 ) the joint memorandum on the conduct of foreign affairs affecting India (C.P.(46;329) presented by the Foreign Secretary and myself, they reached no conclusion as to the Department of ji.m.G. which should exercise the direct control of our relations with the Arab States of the Persian Gulf which it was decided to take over from the Government of India. 2. Discussions have accordingly taken place between officials / of the Treasury, Foreign Office, Colonial Office and India \ Office, with representatives of the other Departments having interests in the area, wit-i a view to making recoramendations on this subject, which involves a decision as to the Parliamontaiy vdte upon whicn tne capital and recurring expenditure involved (the. greater share of which has hitherto been met by Indian revenuesJ should be borne. 3. Control of the Political Resident on behalf of H.M.G. is at present exercised ty the India Office in consultation with the otiier Departments concerned. Hitherto the India Office lias been able to operate, for administrative purposes, through the Government of India. For the future the choice would seem to lie between the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office either of which has certain qualifications for the exercise of h.M.G.*s responsibilities in the area. On the one hand, the Foreign Office are already closely concerned with the external relation^ of the Sheikhdoms whicn are quasi-independent '? agtHigaJStates,officers are not very different from those carried out hy certain of H.L. ’s consular officers stationed in Middle Eastern countries. 1 he major problems which arise for decision in the 1'ersian G-ulf area are political in character, and touch on the relations of H.m.G-. with the neighbouring foreign States, viz. Iraq, Persia and Saudi ^rabia. The Poreign Office, however, though willing to accept eventual transfer of the functions of 1 conorcl and to absorb suitable candidates from the staff inCthe * Poreign Service, are not in a position immediately to assume responsibility for the administrative machinery. i 4. On the other hand, it was found that the Colonial Office ^ are in a position to accept immediate control and are qualified to do so owing to tne circumstances that:- («0 they could provide administrative and other British staff, as vacancies occurred, from the Colonial Service; db they have already local associations v/ith Arabia by reason of,Colonial Office administration of Aden Colony and Protectorate, control of which was transferred to them from the G-overnment of India in 1937; (C) they have much experience in indirect rule involving interference in tne internal affairs of protected States, sucn as is, in practice, inevitable in the case of the Sheikhdoms; and (&amp;; they are accustomed to supervise staffs performing duties of an administrative character such as tne bulk of the work of tne political officers in the Persian Gulf (wnich also includes judicial duties). mureover, the colonial Office are well qualified to assist the ioate Governments in developing medical, educational and welfare activities xor which increased revenues from oil production are likely to provide opportunities. Nevertheless the Colonial Office retire sent at ives pointed out that there might be disadvantages in their Department accepting responsibility in an area where theprincipal questions affecting H.I4G. seem at present largely to concern relations with neighbouring foreign countries and wiijh une oil companies operated by companies with foreign shareholders, f iurt-her, colonial office control of quasi-independent Rulers mignt be misrepresented, in interested quarters, as an intrusion ! of British 'Imperialism' in this region. fhus, neither solution is ideal or free from difficulty. Tne balance of considerations points to the responsibility eventually falling to the Foreign Office. But there cannot be any interruption, and it is essential to secure continuity in tnflj 1 wording of the administrative machine and of our relations with tne Rulers, which at present proceed with smootnness and efficiency. Otherwise certain difficult and pressing questions relating to oil reserves - which constitute 's major strategic and economic interest in the area - may not be successfully handled. Tnis purpose will be best served if the cnanges are introduced gradually, and if the process of eliminating the Government of India from the administrative control of the Political Resident were to be entrusted to a Department familiar with the Indian system. There would also be some advantage in leaving the position fluid for the time being. was accordingly decided to recommend that, while the foreign Office, rather than the Colonial office, might be the eventual repository of this responsibility, for the present - (a) the India Office should from April 1st, 1947 and as an 1110aau1 ^- take over frcm the Government of India direct responsibility for the political posts in the Persian Gulf; (b; uhe cost of faking over and maintaining these posts hitherto met from Indian revenues, but which will now fall to be defrayed by Imperial revenues, should be borne on tne India Ox 1 ice vote with effect from the commencement of the next financial year;{c) the Foreign, Office should, howe\er, take over from the India Office full responsibility for these posts as soon as the administrative machinery in the Foreign Office can be adapted to take over this task with efficiency. amM ^f -l ort should be made to effect the change by 1st April,® 1943. (d) the Secretary of State for India should now be invited , tj negotiate with the Government of India for the transfer to the direct control of on terms to be! agreed with the Treasury, of the services of the necessary personnel and of the buildings and facilities required f for tue service. These negotiations would cover settlement with India for H.L.G.'a interest in the buildings in lersia erected in part at the. cost of Imperial iunds. . /. I commend these proposals to ny colleagues for their approval, and would only a dd that, if they are agreed, I shall also need authority to proceed at once with plans for the construction of a new Residency (comprising both office and living accommodation) to house the Resident and his staff, who j are at present occupying temporary quarters, adapted from existing ouildings, in the Kaval -jase at Jufair. This building programme wixi, I fear, have to be undertaken entirely at the expense of U.K. funds, since, with the elimination of the Government of India from a snare in the control, the contribution from Indian revenues which it nad been hoped to secure can no longer be expected. Financial autnonty for any such programme of works would, of course be sought from the Treasury. ThS C ° st 01 tne exist ^ng establishments and services in this area is at present of the order of £100,000 a year. The scale of expenditure will be subject to reconsideration in view of the elimination of the Government of India's interest. On the other hand, heavy capital, expenditure will have to be faced in the /provisionMB ■■IYour Reference TREASURY CHAMBERS, GREAT GEORGE STREET, LONDON, S.W.l. 17th December, 1946 My dear Donaldson Arab States of the Persian Gulf I have thought further about this question since last we spoke on the telephone and have had a talk with Gardener of the Foreign Office. I am reluctantly driven to the conclusion that it would be useless at thii stage to ask the Foreign Office to take effective control of this problem because their administrative machinery is undergoing such a strain with all the business consequent on the establishment of the new Foreign Service that it could not hope to make any effective contribution. That being so, we must agree that the India Office will have to carry on for the present, bearing all expenditure on its Vote and answering to Parliament for its policy and for what it does with the money. I am bound to say, however, that the Treasury will continue to press for the Foreign Office to take over responsibility at the earliest possible date, and I think that it should be recorded in the draft Cabinet Paper that this is the intention. I suggest that we set as a target 1st April, 1948 for the assumption by the Foreign Office of this duty. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baxter and to Gardener and they will, no doubt, comment on the feasibility of this proposal. You will realise, of course, that the whole of your expenditure will have to be subject to fairly E.P.Donaldson, ^sq., C.M.G India Office. /closeclose Treasury control and I should be grateful if you could at once prepare a detail of your spending proposals for 19U6-47. In particular, we shall wish to put you on your defence as to why it is necessary I to maintain the same standard of expenditure ©^hereto fore. It by no means follows in our view that .rhat was required in the interests of the Government of India is required in the interests of H.M.G. We shall wish to know why it is that we have to maintain these curious administrative services like Post Offices etc. Returning to the draft Cabinet Paper, if this is to go forward as an agreed Paper, I should like to lake the following comments:- J Para. 3. I am afraid that we cannot agree the 3rd sentence, since it seems to us that the only case for the India Office handling this problem rests on administrative convenience during the interim period. Even if the India Office remain as a permanency as the Office responsible for H.M.G.*3 relations with India that would be no reason in our view for the India Office handling relations with * '^ foreign states which have nothing to do with India. * it C*. r** - * In para. 6 (a), I am not sure about ’’as soon 1 as possible”. There is, amongst other things, the technical consideration that if the India Office ^ have to start paying money before 1st April, 1946, '' ** they - will have to take a Supplementary Estimate Tor the purpose. If this is necessary the Supplementary will have to be faced, but I imagine that you would not wish to have attention drawn to the new policy as a resultTsfe Supplementary Estimate having to be /introduced-3- /heavy introduced for the purpose. If the Governor of India can carry on until 1st April, I should have thought that you might have made 1st April the operative date. A similar point arises under (b) where I suggest you omit the words ’'earliest convenient date not later ,y + Vi a -in M At this point I should like to see inserted an additional recommendation (c) as follows 'The Foreign Office should, however, take over from the India Office full responsibility for these posts as soon as £he administrative machinery in the Foreign Office oouXch be adapted to take over this task with efficiency. Effort should be made to effect the change by 1st April, 1948.' After your last recommendation, which would be numbered (d) I should like to insert - At, 'These negotiations would cover settlement with India for H.M.G.’s interest in the buildings in Persia erected in part at the cost of Imperial Funds.' In para. 7 at the end I should like to insert - 'Financial authority for any such programme of works would, of course, be sought from the Treasury'. I am afraid that I still think that the Paper should include some reference to the cost of these Persian Gulf Services. I suggest the final para, to read - 'The cost of the existing establishments and services in this area is at present of the order of £103*000. The scale of expenditure will be subject to reconsideration in view of the elimination of the Government of India’s interest. On the other hand,-4- wm heavy capital expenditure will have to be faced in the provision of a new Sesidency, which might be of the order of £50,000'. If you agree broadly with the above suggestions, could we have a revised draft which we could submit to the Chancellor? Yours sincerely,Under-Secretary of St Sir D. Monte at h has not jet ae£n the Colonial Office letter but meanwhile I was approached by Mr. Abell yesterday wno said tnat Lord V/avell ■was very anxious that a conclusion should be reached on this matter witn the least possible delay. H.B. was prepared to speak to the Secretary of State about it if it was felt that it would strengthen our hands. /■ V M ; 1 explainea the position/and have since spoken to Mr. vfinmfrith on tire telephone, lie took the line tnat the reason why the treasury proposed that the Foreign Office should assume financial control from the staro was that the li_e oi the ±ndia Office seemed to be drawing rapidly to a close and it appeared doubtful whether it would be worth while placing this expenditure on the India Office Vote xor 1^4-7/46 if the Office were to be v liquidated before the end 01 the linancial year. I asked him Wiietxier he had consulted the Foreign Office on this; he replied that he thought a copy had gone to Mr. Gardener (but'l had previously ascertained that ne had not been informed) and undertook to ascertain Foreign Office views. I told him that I was doubtful ix the foreign Office would welcome the arrangerosnts (having previously ascertained from Mr. Gardener that they would not) and that the Foreign Office would be quite contenu to continue as hitherto with an extension of the arrangements by which we get Foreign Off ice .concurrence in major iteras (i.e. over £1,000) of divisible expenditure.

I am sending copies of this letter to Caccia, Winnifrith and Stock- 1Sir D.Mpnte^th . It is tiresome of the Treasury to insist on this. But I don't suppose it would be any use making further attempts to shift them. It is not, I imagine, that the Treasury regard the Foreign Office as economy-minded and addicted to frugality in administration. But, of course, there is an idea abroad, which the Foreign Office in the past •have done their best to encourage, that the Persian Gulf administration has been run according to Indian, and therefore somewhat grandiose, scales. I daresay the Treasury feel that the maintenance of the old scales and standards should not outlive the Government of India's responsibility, and think that an adjustment is more likely to take place if the responsibility is on the Foreign Office from the outset, than if there is a transitional phase during which we are responsible. I think it will be an embarrassing and un satisfactory position for us if we have to carry on as the agents of the Foreign Office, especially if I am right in interpreting the latter part of Winnifrith's letter on the lines of what I have just said. But I am afraid we may simply get a rebuff from the Cabinet if we decline to make ourselves useful on what may be regarded as grounds of amour propre and prestige. » I should be inclined to write to the Foreign ! Office, informing them that the Treasury stick to their point, saying that we feel very disinclined to carry on on this basis and asking them whether they cannot think /againagain about taking the job over immediately. .

I can tell you in confluence thrt the position in the Persian Gulf in relation to the conetitution^i. changes taking place in Indie hae been considered by the Government and that the Departments concerned nave b&lt;en charged aith the preparation of the necessary action. /»s, however, the question will involve negotietione with the Government of India, you will appreciate that we should prefer not to make any public reference on the subject. r Colonel The kight Honourable Stanley, y.C.(£ 10679/14U3/(|1) In your speech in the Foreign Affairs debate in the House on the 23rd October you asked the question about the 'Trucial Sheikhs', to which I was not able to refer in my reply. As a matter of fact the Sheikhs of K owe it and Bahrein and the Sultan of I/uscat do not figure among the Truciel Sheikhs. The Trucial Sheiichs are the rulers of certain email territories along the south eastern shore of the Persian Oulf, namely Abu Dhabi, Dubei, Kalba, hsrjah, U n al ^awain and Ras al Khaimsh. The rulers of theae territories are in close treaty relations with His Majesty's Ooverntment dating bac* to the last century, wncn the British navy was actively engaged in the suppression of piracy and slave trading in the Persian Oulf. The coast had previously been Kno'*n as the Pirate coast, but when all the rulers had made treaties of maritime truce / with Colonel The Right Honourable 0* ' • G• Stanley, • •* ^ ‘ —with Hie Vejeety*6 Government, it ceme to be known 88 the Trucial Coast. Under these treaties, the rulers, besides unaerteitin, not to engege in piracy, the arms traffic or the slave trade, agreed in effect to place the management of their foreign affairs in the hands of His Majesty’s Government and to refer disputes between themselves and cases of aggression to the decision of the British Politics! Resident. The foreign relations of these states, as also of the states of Xoweit and Bahrein, which you mentioned, are conducted through the Political \ Resident in the Persian Gulf, who while a member of the Indian Political Service, iu ultimately responsible to His Majesty’s Government in the United 'ingdocn. At the same time, he keeps the Government of India fully informed of the local situation ana settles ell matters of administrative detail with them. The altering situation in India will clearly call for a moaification of these arrangements with Aa vie* to bringing the Political hesident in the Persian Oulf directly unaer His Majesty’s Government in all respects. This is a jib t ter 1 which will involve negotiation with the Government of India, but no decision has yet been taken as to the department to which the Political Resident will in future be responsible. / % vCOPY (S 11314/1443/90 Dorchester Hotel, Park: Lane, W. 1 . 13 th November, 1946. Dear Hector, Many thanks indeed for your letter of 6th November about the Trucial Sheikhs. I am sorry I made these inclusive, instead of exclusive, of the rulers I mentioned. I notice that the situation is being considered, but surely in view of the near approach of the transfer of power in India the position is becoming urgent. Yours ever, (Signed) Oliver StanleyTel.

C/,.- A f • f. u U ^ j &gt;■&gt; x f' 1 : l I am sorry thaV.you have had«Jfco remind me in your letter of 2nd December that we have not yet sent you our comments on the draft Cabinet Paper sent to us on 23rd November. I am afraid that there are two points which we should wish to be included in the memorandum if it is to go forward as an agreed memorandum:- 'kh® first place, whilst we are reluctantly willing to agree to the India Office carrying on''as— a caretaker up to the point when the Foreign Office feels acle to take over, we should wish financial responsibility to be pinned on to the Foreign Office straight away. The Foreign Office would be free to ask the India Office to act as its agents, but ultimate responsibility would lie with the Foreign Ofiice. This would have the advantage from our point of view of ensuring that the Foreign Office from the start was in touch with and responsible for the scale of expenditure in the near future so that when they came to take over they did not find a fait accompli which it would be very difficult to upset. 2. Our second point is this. The Cabinet Conclusion to which you refer in the opening paragraph also took note that the Foreign Office and the India^ Office would consult further regarding the total cost and phasing of the expenditure involved in the changes proposed in the means of representing U.K. interests in the countries adjacent to India. We feel that E.P.Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G. India Office. /inin view of* this direction your Paper should at least indicate the scale of expenditure likely to be involved. So far as the Arab States are conceraad a very rough estimate would meet our requiremei^, but we think that this at least should be provided. .Yours sincerely,Prom .

The position with regard to the Cabinet*s conclusion ^ of 4th September is now as follows i- Declsion to assume as rapidly as possible direct control of and responsibility for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and his subordinate Agencies* The position as regards control of the Persian Gulf residency and subordinate Agencies is that when the draft Cabinet Paper (which we have just sent to the Departments concerned for their comments) has been approved by the Cabinet we shall, with the agreement of the Treasury, be able to say to the Government of India i- • 1. H.M.G. would like to take over the whole responsibility for the Persian Gulf and themselves to bear the expenditure involved as tram April 1st, 1947* or possibly sooner. (Comment : It is possible that the Government of India will not be willing to go on paying for the Residency eto. so long as until the 1st April next. Prom the practical point of view this is much the simplest date to end at)* * « * ♦ 2* H.M.G. would, at the same time, like to take over from the Government of India certain of the buildings at present ' used by the political author!t es in the Gulf. ( Comment : The ‘ Agencies etc. are all owned by the Government of India and they will have to be asked how much they want for them. The Treasury and Ministry of Works however will presumably, before agreeing to take them over, wish to be satisfied that they are all necessary and worth buying and will also require to inspect them before accenting the Government of India’s figures). 3* H.M.G. would also like to obtain the services of certain members of the Indian Political Service with special experience/experience of the Persian Gulf, or for other reasons regarded as particularly suitable. ( Caaaent : Col. Hay is anxious that th£, officers in (question should'loe allowed to continue to belong to the Indian Political Service so long as that service exists. It will presumably be necessary, in consultation with the Political e si dent and the Government of India, to draw ur a list of officers to be selected} the terms of employment to be offered to them will presumably vary in accordance with the amount of service they still have to do. In the case of the more senior officers they will perhaps be offered a contract for a limited number of years while the more junior officers may be absorbed into an established service of e.g* Foreign Service). In connection with the financial aspects of H.M.G.'s desire to take over control of the Persian Gulf, in the negotiations with the Government of India there will inevitably arise the question of the division as between H.M.G. and the Government of India of special wartime expenditure in the Persian Gulf which has been incurred during the war years. This has amounted, I think, to something like JEA),0 (jO a year and except for the Muscat Defence Subsidy of £18,000 a yeax* (which is included in the £&amp;) 9 0QC and the incidence of which as between the Government of India and H.M.G. has been fixed as 55 to 45) the proportion has not yet been agreed. I presume that,as the first step, when we put to the Government of India out proposals to take over control of the Persian Gulf, we shall confine ourselves to the statements of 1, 2 and 5 above without attempting at that stage to go into til the financial questions involved and that we shall await the Government of India’s reactions before preparing detailed financial proposals. i Investigation of the Consular Posts in Persia which it will be necessary to maintain and staff by Foreign Servioe Officers with reinforcement from the I.P.S.

Minute 3) the joint memorandum on the conduct of foreign affairs affecting India (C.P.(4^;329) presented by the Foreign Secretary and myself, they reached no conclusion as to the Department of which should exercise the direct control of our relations with the Arab States of the Persian G-ulf which it was decided to take over from the Government of India. 2. Discussions have accordingly taken place between officials of the Treasury, Foreign Office, Colonial Office and India Office, with representatives of the other Departments having interests in the area, with a view to making recommendations on this subject, which involves a decision as to the Parliamentary — Vote upon which the capital and recurring expenditure involved (tne greater share of wnich has hitherto been met by Indian revenues) should be borne. 3. Control of the Political Resident on behalf of H.M.G. is at present exercised by the India Office in consultation with the other Departments concerned. Hitherto the India Office has been able to operate, for acbainistrative purposes, through the Government of India. Were it not for the uncertainty surrounding the future of the India Office, it would be the natural course for the India Office to continue its present functions and extend them so as to cover the disappearance of the Government of India from the scene. Failing that, the choice would lie between the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office either of which has certain qualifications for the exercise of H.U.G. ’ s * /responsibilities /—V 1responsibilities in the area. On the one hand, the Foreign Office are already closely concerned with the external relations of the Sheikhdoms which are quasi-independent foreign States, and some of the functions performed by the British political officers are not very different from tnose carried out by certain of.H.ih’s consular officers stationed in Middle Eastern countries. The major problems which arise for decision in the Persian Gulf area are political in character, and touch on the relations of with the neighbouring foreign States, viz. Iraq, Persia and Saudi iirabia. The Foreign Office, however, though willing to accept eventual transfer of the functions of control and to absorb the staff in the Foreign Service, are not in a position immediately to assume responsibility for the administrative machinery. 4. On the other hand, it was found that the Colonial Office were capable of taking immediate control, and have local associations witn Arabia by reason of Colonial Office administration of Aden Colony and protectorate. They seem to be » better qualified than the Foreign Office, in*some respects, for supervising the operations of the political authorities because of the largely administrative character of the bulk of these officers’ work (which also includes judicial duties) and because of the amount of interference in the internal affairs of the Sheikhdoms which is, in practice, inevitable. Moreover, the Colonial Office are well qualified to assist the State Governments in medical, educational and welfare activities. Nevertheless the Colonial Office representatives were themselves doubtful whether it would be wholly appropriate for a Department mainly concerned witn the administration, through local Governments, of Colonial territories, to handle matters involving indirect rule, through British political officers, of the local Arab State Governments. Further, they saw difficulties in the Colonial Office undertaking responsibility for an area in wnich a number /of ■ 1I-—HWp oof .delicate international questions would arise - e. g. in particular *those relating to the Oil Companies having foreign shareholding interests operating there. They felt, too, that Colonial Office control of quasi-independent Rulers might perhaps he misrepresented, in interested quarters, as an extension of British 'Imperialism' out of keeping with the spirit of the times. 5. Thus, neither solution is ideal or free from difficulty. But the balance of considerations points to the responsibility eventually falling to the Foreign Office. But there cannot be any interruption, and it is essential to secure continuity in the working of the administrative machine and of our relations with the Rulers, whicn at present proceed with smoothness and efficiency. Otherwise certain difficult and pressing questions relating to oil reserves - which constitute H.M.G.*3 major strategic and economic interest in the area - may not be successfully handled. This purpose will be best served if the changes are introduced gradually, and if the process of eliminating the G-overnment of India from the administrative control of the'Political Resident were to be entrusted to a Department familiar with the Indian system. There would also be some advantage in leaving the position fluid for the time being. 6. It was accordingly decided to recommend that, while the Foreign Office, rather than the Colonial Office, might be the eventual repository of this responsibility, for the present - (a) the India Office should as soon as possible take over from the G-overnment of India direct responsibility for the political posts in the Persian G-ulf; (b) the cost of taking over and maintaining these posts hitherto rnet from Indian revenues, but which will now fall to be defrayed by Imperial revenues, should be borne on the India Office Vote with effect from the earliest convenient date, not later than the commencement of the A°) next financial year;1 (c) the Secretary of State for India should now be invited to negotiate with the G-overnment of India for the transfer to tne direct control of rLM.G-., on terras to be agreed v/ith tne Treasury, of the services of the necessary personnel and of the buildings and facilities required for the service. 7. I cormnend tnese proposals to my colleagues for their approval, and ..mild only add tnat, if they are agreed, I shall also need authority to proceed at once with plans for the construction of a new Residency (comprising both office and living accommodation) to house the Resident and his staff, who are at present occupying temporary quarters, adapted from existing buildings, in the Naval Base at Jufair. This building programme will, I fear, have to be undertaken entirely at the expense of U.K. funds, since, with the elimination of the G-overnment of India from a share in the control, the contribution from Indian revenues which it had been hoped to secure can no longer be expected. India Office, Whitehall, S. W. 1. November,I! / On 4th September last (CM (46) 79th Conclusions - No.3) .the Cabinet approved the proposals put forward in CP (46) 329 in regard to the future conduct of India's Foreign Affairs subject to reservation by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the Treasury should be further consulted on the financial aspects of the proposals for U. K. representation in countries adjacent to India. Paragraph 15 of CP (46) 329 dealt with the Persian Gulf and stated that 'The magnitude and character of the interests of H.M. G. on the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf make it necessary that the charge of these interests should be in reliable hands and under H.M.G. 's direct control. We must not risk any Indian interference with our essential interests in this area'. Interdepartmental discussion has taken place at the official level as to the Department of H.M. G. which in future should be charged with the responsibility of safeguarding H.M.G. 's interests in the Persian Gulf. A meeting, of which the minutes are below, was held on 6th November under Sir W. Croft's Chairmanship, the upshot -Of whi§h was that the ultimate inheritance should fall eithereto the Foreign Office or to the Colonial Office - the decision as between the two being one for Ministers — but that neither was at the present time in a position to undertake the responsibility - the Foreign Office owing to lack of administrative expertise and personnel, the Colonial Office owing to lack of acquaintance with the political aspects arising: the corollary was that for the time being the responsibility would most convenienttycontinue to be discharged as hitherto by the India Office, which, however, would have to take on its Vote the expenditure involved, v/hich hitherto has been distributed otherwise. The draft memorandum puts into shape the conclusions of the interdepartmental discussion for the consideration of the Ministers involved, in particular the Foreign Secretary, the Colonial Secretaiy, the Minister of Fuel and Power, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and yourself. The suggestionis that the draft memorandum should be sent to the appropriate officer in these Departments for submission to the Minister in each case for his provisional comments. If all concur in the recommendations in the draft memorandum it would no doubt be possible for you to put it in as an agreed paper for the Cabinet to approve and take note of and enable the Departments concerned to proceed with the administrative arrangements which will be required to give effect to the proposals. As this stage, therefore, I submit the paper for your — y-‘-.ii^nftl approval, only, subject to the reactions displayed by those of your colleagues who are directly concerned. 21/11V Sir william Graft , Copies of the note of the meeting held last tfednesd^y are being distributed today and I attach your copy below. The next step is to refer to the Departments primarily concerned the draft of the Cabinet Paper to give effect to the conclusions of the meeting and I attach a draft Cabinet Paper with a covering letter which might be addressed to Lr. Caccia, Foreign Office, hr. Vfinnifrith, Treasury, Mr. Martir* Colonial Office and Mr. Stock, Ministry of Pule &amp; Power. The draft Paper leaves open the question of which Department should be the eventual heir to the responsibilities^ but otherwise, I think, conforms to the views expressed. In the draft covering letter I have suggested that it may not be necessary to put this up to the Cabinet if agreement can be reached by departmental submission; an alternative might be, thisj^primarily a financial matter, for the point to be put in a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer instead of to the Cabinet.DR^FT m H*A.

In these circumstances it was concluded that as the functions of the Political Resident ware neither so predominantly representative and political as to make it natural for him to fall within the Foreign Office sphere, nor so overwhelmingly administrative and judicial as to justify incorporating his organisation into the Colonial Service, some compromise /solution ^solution sliould be sought. In addition it was pointed out by the representative of the Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power that continuity in the handling of the administrative machine, which at present works with smoothness and efficiency, was essential if the difficult iaternatienal questions relating to oil reserves which constitute H.M.G. *3 major strategic and economic interest t ,A* r ( j ^ in the arefyure to be successfully overcome. This could only be done if tiie changes were introduced gradually^ and if the process of eliminating the Groveriment of India from the administrative control of the Political Resident were entrusted to a Department familiar with the Indian system. w 6 . It was accordingly decided to recommend that, without prejudice to a decision as to the ultimate future control of the tffi f J K m ^ JC\ J ^ polltieetl auttiorit iea in the Persian Gulf in the light of the situation resulting from the transfer now contemplated, and of the constitutional cxianges impending in India - (a) the india Office should ns soon as possible taice over from the Government of India direct responsibility for pk v £V&gt; i ►va^ . the political authorities in the Persian Gulf j (b) tae± the cost of maintaining these posts hitherto met from Indian revenues, but which will now fall to be defrayed on*Imperial revenues, should be borne on the India Office Vote with effect from the earliest convenient date, not later than the commencement of the next financial year; (c) .ttaMt the Secret ary of State for India should warn be invited to negotiate with the Government of India for the transfer to the direct control of the Home Government on terns to be agreed with the Treasury, the services of the necessary administrative and subordinate personnel andythe buildings and facilities required for v the service. 7 * I commend these proposals to rqy colleagues for their approval, and would only add that if they are agreed I shall also /needM§3%V need authority to proceed at once with plana for the construction of a new Residency (comprising both office and living acconnodation) to house the Resident and his staff who are at present occupying temporary quarters adapted from * existing buildings in the Naval Base at Jufair. This building programme will, X fegj^ have to be undertaken entirely at the expense of U.iU funds, since the contribution fraa Indian revenues which it had been hoped to secure is not now likely to be forthcoming with the elimination of the G-overniaent of India from a share in the control of the political and administrative officers in the Persian Gulf* J ^ • \ iMr. Dor&amp;ltison . I consider it most important that I.P.S. officers in the Gulf should be allowed to serve on their present terms at any rate until the terms on which officers of the Indian Services are to be mustered out are announced, and probably until the actual date of the mustering out. It will in any case be essential for them to continue to serve on the x resent terms until some Department of H.M.G. is in a position to select tiie officers it requires, and offer them otner terms. It will be difficult for officers to decide vrietiier or not to accept tae terms offered them unless tney know what they are going to receive in the way of pension or gratuity when their service under the Government of India terminates, and the probable date of termination of this service. Further, for some time to come the Gov era: 1 .* nt of India will have to provide reliefs for officers in the Gulf proceeding on leave or going sick. It will lead to endless &lt; ilficulties if these reliefs nave either to lose pay on coming to the Gulf or to be given ^ a v in excess of the regular incumlents.I.lr. Donalds on. In continuation of iqy note about terras for officers serving in the £ulf, one of tne concessions which they at present enjoy is freedom from income-tax. Tuis is to compensate them for the severe climatic conditions and lack of amenities in the G-ulf posts. If they were now to be subjected to British income-tax they would lose half their pay and be much worse off than their brother officers in India. This would lead to great discontent and for most officers acute financia difficulty. I consider it therefore essential that t.iis concession snould be continued (or that an equivalent allowance should be granted) until officers are offered and accept terms for service under some Department of xi.ti.G-. tfhat I have said above also applies to the subordinate staff. I would suggest that to overcome the difficulty of exempting officers paid by H.l.i. G-. from British income-tax, the Government of India should hereby be paid a lump sum subsidy to cover their expenditure in the G-ulf and that the question of income-tax should not be raised. I have marked this note personal because the income-tax concession is never mentioned in correspondence with the • Government of India. I believe that under the latest Indian Income-Tax Act officers and others receiving pay from the G-overnment of India in the Gulf are technically liable to pay income-tax. The question has however never been raised and there is a sort of tacit agreement that the concession should continue. I would ask therefore that, if it can be / avoided* V avoided, the matter should not be nientioned in official correspondence with the G-overmaent of India. * (3gd.) VI.li.

Hay (political Resident in the Persian Sir William Croft referred to the. note which had been circulated by the India Office before the meeting. While it was clear that major political matters arising in the Persian Gulf would in any case remain under the control of the Foreign Office, there seemed to be three possible alternative arrangements for future administration:- (a) for the India Office to retain control, so long as it existed in its present form, taking over the administrative functions formerly performed by the Government of India; or (b) for the Foreign Office, or (c) the Colonial Office, to take over control and to provide On the face of it, the most convenient arrangement might seem to be for the India Office to retain control, for the interim period, but the Treasury had raised certain objections. 2. Sir William Croft explained that the administrative functions included public works (the question of provision of accommodation for the Political Resident was of immediate importance), the setting up of a separate postal system, lighting and buoying, currency, quarantine arrangements, and the performance of judicial functions by the political officers in the Gulf. Another question of major importance which would have to be considered was the provision of personnel for the staffing of the Gulf posts. These had hitherto been supplied by the Indian Political Service and the officers concerned would presumably continue to belong to that Service until it was wound up, in perhaps a year or two’s time, and meanv/hile remain on present Gulf) Mr. S.P.

Harrison (India Office) for the discharge of the administrative functions in question. /conditionsconditions and rates of pay. 3• lur, Larshall ( Treasury ) explained that the Treasury objections to the 'proposal that the India Office should ret,in control for the time being and that the expenditure should be placed on the India Office vote ./ere; - (a) tne untiay accounting arrangements thereby involved; and (b) that the department which was ultimately to bear responsibility might be prejudiced by decisions in which it had no say being taken during the interim period, e.g. regarding pe rs onnel. In discussion it was suggested that the interim pi. ,iod would probably last at least until India's future status had been determined, Colonel Hay said that until the Inaian Political Service .as dissolved, selection of personnel would not be necessary. 4. Mr. G-arran (Foreign Office ), said that, on political grounds, the Foreign 0: fice thought that it was more satisfactory that they should take over the whole administration in due course. Although the Foreign Office had no administrative service, as such, the functions of the political officers were not unlike those that had been performed bjr Consular officers in Egypt and Persia i.r. Gardener added that the Foreign Service was in process of re-organisation and the Foreign Office were not in a position to assume the administrative responsibilities at the moment. He thought that the Foreign Office would allow the present officers to carry on as hitherto under the Government of Inuia uniil the Indian Services were wound up and would then take these officers on on a contract basis. As regards administrative matters such as the Postal Service, Mr* Gardener thought that the Foreign Office could obtain the personnel to run this, but he agreed that they had not the background to supervise the running of such a service. 6. For the Colonial Office , Mr. Martin said that his observations were made on the understanding that the purpose of the meeting was to consider the various aspects of the question with a view to a submission being made to Ministers. The Colonial Secretary bad not pet expressed a view. 7. As against the Colonial Office taking, over the responsibility there were the following considerations:- (a) Many of the questions of moment in the Persian Gulf were already handled by the Foreign Office. (b) The Colonial Office had not been much concerned with oil politics which were of particular importance in the Persian Gulf. (c) He wondered how the acceptance of responsibility by the Colonial Office would be regarded by the Sheikhs themselves and whether it would be objected to by the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.- as an extrusion of British Imperialism,- 3 - 8. On the other hand, in favour of the Colonial Office taking over responsibility v/ere the following considerations:- The Colonial Office had the means to take it over at once. Administration in the Sheikhdoms would be similar to that already undertaken by them in other parts of the Colonial Empire, They had the technical experts, e.g, in medicine, education and in welfare work generally (Colonel Hay confirmed that with the new influx of wealth from oil development there was a large field for material and welfare developments; the Rulers welcomed our assistance in such matters). As regards the question of the India Office accepting responsibility in the interim period Mr. Martin thought there need be no particular difficulo/ as long as the Colonial Office were kept in touch -.ith long-term policy. he Colonial Office could, from t-heir o\m services, supply men for particular posts as vacancies arose, 9* Sir William Croft thought that it would probably not be necessary to introduce officers from the Colonial Service while the Indian Services were still in existence. As regards the continued employment of the present members of the Indian Political Service, he suggested that the compensation they might expect to receive on the disbandment of the Indian Services would probably make it possible for such officers to continue employment under the Colonial Office on rates less high than present I.P.S. scales. He thought, himself, that there would be some advantage in maintaining a state of fluidity for a time. It was impossible to say for how longthe ' interim period' would last ^jper haps for two or three years or more)or what developments there might be in thu meantime. He then asked the representatives of other departments present to give their views. 10. Mr. Lov/ said that it was really immaterial to the Air Ministry whether the Foreign Office or the Colonial Office eventually took over. 11. The Ministry of Works representative said that they were only interested from the point of view of buildings. On this point Mr, Marshall said that the Treasury would have no objection to the India Office supervising the provision of tempercry buildings and putting the expenditure on the India Office vote, the work being done on an agency basis by the Indian P.W.D. 12. The .ministry of Civil Aviation representative mentioned the probable sensitivity of the Arab League and the U.S. Government on the subject. In view of this and the international aspect of the Civil Air Agreements with the Sheikhs he would be inclined to favour the Foreign Office as the eventual heir. Colonel Hay explained that the Rulers concerned had no relations with the Arab League. They would probably prefer to be dealt with by a department of H.M.G, which was not responsible for H.M.G's relations ■« ith their great neighbours, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, of whom they were apprehensive. He v/as not, however, sure what the Sultan of Muscat's attitude would be. 13. The Admiralty representative thought that the responsibility should remain with the India Office for the interim period. In view of the Foreign Office concern with neighbouring territories, he was inclined to think that they should be the eventual heirs, 14. Mr. Stock said that the Ministry of Fuel and Power were concerned in view of the vital importance of the Persian Gulf as a major source oil supplies. His Ministry would be very reluctant to see any hiatus /ofof administration, particularly as some ^ar^ngei.ients importance uere now looming up. He thought that the present arrg whereby the India Office exercised supervrsxon worked well m pra and that any change should only be introduced gradually. 15.

His Ministry would be very reluctant to see ar\y hiatus of administration, particularly as some difficult problems of major importance were now moving- up. He thought that the present arrangements whereby the India Office JU. t exercised supervision worked well and that any change should only be introduced gradually.

The Sultanate of Muscat is an independent state and has treaty relations with the U.S.A., Prance and the Netherlands as well as with H.M.G. and the Government of India. The Sultan, however, usually relies on H.M.G. for advice and in practice his position vis-a-vis the Political Resident and the local Political Agent differs little from that of the /Rulers of the Sheikhdoms. S', It had been proposed that the India Office, for so long as it remains in existence,should continue to deal with the Persian Gulf but the Treasury are not inclined to favour this proposal and are of the opinion that expenditure in the Persian Gulf sJaewiW- be included from the beginning in the Vote of the department which will Urtuld fabuM+tJfty ktA** eventually deal with it # aaw/that if the India Office continue to function in respect of the Gulf yxhey should only do so as agents of that department. One practical difficulty has arisen which makes it necessary to decide at once which department should assume responsibility, and that is” that expenditure is already being incurred on the adaptation of the ^aval &amp;.se at Bahrein for the temporary accomnodation of the Residency which has recently been moved from Bushire and that plans have to be made for a Residency.

It would appear, therefore, at first sight that the Foreign Office would be the appropriate department to take over. On the other hand the Political Resident and his officers have many administrative responsibilities; they interfere when there are serious disorders or misrule in any ol the States and exercise judicial functions in respect of foreigners (including British subjects). The expansion of oil activities in the Persian Gulf, especially on the Trucial Coast, is likely to make increased administrative interference necessary. However, such matters as posts and telegraphs, quarantine tub Kby ^ en ' ^ ' , vuZj J- {J J &gt; /cnrO It (Avvta. , and buoying and lighting have in the past been dealt with by the Government of India, either directly or through its officers in the Gulf, and these matters will now have to be taken over by H.M.G. ^ ^2 ^ 7 - It is not considered likely that the Rulers of the States will object to being dealt with through the Colonial rather than the Foreign Office. They are anxious for control direct by H.M.G. rather than through the Government of India and will probably pay little attention to the question of the department which is to exercise that control. In fact, the Julers of the Sheikhdoms may well consider that their interests would be better served by a department which is not responsible for the conduct of relations with their powerful neighbours, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. /fith(4) With regard to the date from which responsibility is to be assumed, this should be as early as possible.

It is now urgently necessary to-communicate this decision to the Governmentof India, and to settle, in consultation with that G-overnraent, now the adminis-ration shall be conducted in future. But before this can be doney*it ^ust be determined -— (a) On what Parliamentary Vote the expenditure is to be borne, and consequently what Department of shall in future exercise administrative control over the political authorities in the Persian G-ulf; . (bj How soon the change should be introduced; (c) \'/hat functions (if any) the India Office should perform in relation to t he administrative machine in the area after the elimination of the G-overnment of India from the control of ohat administrat ion has . been effected. 4, It had been proposed that, o\ri.ngto the past association of the India Off ice/with the a a^inistrat ion, ***4 k /Ou-D* y/ tis- experience/ln handling the political problems,&lt;£it would be appropriate that, so long as that Office remained in being, the expenditure might be borne on the India Office Vote and that the Secretary of State for India should talce over from the Government, of India, for the. time being, direct re sido risibility for the administrative machine pending a decision as to its ultimate transfer. It is understood, however, that the Treasury are not inclined to favour this proposal^but consider that expenditure on the Persian Gulf posts should be borne from the outset on the Vote of the * Department whicn will eventually take it over., 5. If this view is adopted^it is necessary to make a recommendation to Ministers at once us to the Vote on which the expenditure will, fall 7 since a liability has already been incurred for the cost of the adaptation of the haval Base at /BahrainBaiirfiin for the temporary accommodation of the Residency which has recently been moved thither from Bushire. Moreover, tne construction of a new Residency with office and living accommodation must now be undertaken at bahr&amp;in. The Government of India are unwilling to bear any of the cost of tnese operations since they were opposed to the move of the Residency and the India Office are not in a position, without Treasury autnority, to sanction any estimates or plans Further building operations are now held up pending a decision on this question.-- 6. The Foreign Office lint mated ! that^wherTlhe transitionsO. period comes to an end, responsibility for the administration should be undertaken by them. They are closely concerned with the more important questions arising in the Persian G-ulf^ involving problems of tne external relations of the Principalities with neighbouring States, the concessions held by the oil companies which have an international share .capital, and the international obligations (e.g. in connection witn civil aviation, etc.) accepted by on behalf of the filers. On the other hand, the political authorities have many administrative responsibilities to perform. They interfere when there are serious disorders or misrule in any of the States, they adjudicate in any territorial disputes between the Rulers, and exercise judicial functions in respect of foreigners (including British subjects). The expansion of oil activities in the Persian G-ulf, especially on the Trucial Coast, is likely to make increased administrative intervention necessary. Further, the management of the postal and telegraph administration^, /quarantinequarantine^ ana light^and buoying in tne Gulf trri-cg. have hitherto been dealt v/ith bj/- the Government of India through the local authorities/will now have to be directed by the Home Government^.i'he political 6fficers^wno belong to the Indian Political Service will require to be absorbed into the appropriate Overseas Service of G-. and provision made for a cadre of trained personnel experienced in handling Arabic-sj^ealcing peoples if the administration is to be efficiently carried on. The Political Resident and certain of his predecessors have expressed the view that, on account of these administrative responsibilities, and because of the interest and experience of the Colonial Office in dealing with the Liiddle Eas^area, it might be found convenient to graft^Persian Gulf administration on to trie Colonial Service rather than the Foreign Service. It is recognised, however, that this is a matter on which a Ministerial decision will be required. As regards the date to be fixed for the transfer of the administration, this should be as early as possible (since the Government of India are unlikely to agree to handing over the administration until the expenditure is accepted as a charge on Imperial revenues). It should therefore take place not later than the beginning of the financial year 194-7-194&amp;* cj. If the Treasury view is accepted that the India Office Vote cannot bear^during tne interim period^the expenditure on the Persian Gulf administration, the India Office could only continue to function^after the elimination of the Government of India* s control^ as the agent of the Department on whose Vote the expenditure will be borne. This position would not be acceptable to the India Office and it would therefore be necessary for the Department taking transferto assume from the outset full responsibility for the administration^and to conduct negotiations -with the G-overrment of India (presumably through the U.K. High Gommissioncr in hew Delhi) for the necessary transfer of the services of the staff and other subsidiary questions, . . .S'.

Mr. Donaldson read a letter just received frera the admiralty No. M.01019/46 of 22nd October, st -ting the terms on v;hich the . .dmirelty felt them .lve,: t ,ble to allov; the use of the Naval buildings as Residency as a temporary measure. This left no doubt that it vas necessary to contemplate building a p rmanent Residency v.ith as little delay as possible. Mr. Barker said that estimates made in 1937 had- ouoted £ 130 , 0#0 as'the estimated expenditure on a new building but that with increased prices, this figure might veil have to be uoublcd to reach an estimate of the present cost of building on the scale then contemplated. Colonel Hay said that the buildings he now contemplated would not be on quite such a lavish scale as the pre-war plans. He thought that something on the lines of a bungalow-ceoir? vith air-conditioned roems would be suitable for office and living accommodation, reception roans would be required for official entertainment. This would mean a great ro auction in the height of all the rooms ana in the area of many of them, and the cost would be correspondingly reduced.

They could then go ahead v.’ith seeking sanction for the remaining £2,000. 3* Mr* Marshall then raised the question of the ultim-te incidence of the expenditure, both in respect of the temporary and the permanent buildings.

Cater said that he would like the Colonial Office to be represented at any talks with the Treasury and .foreign Office about future arrangements. r.ieanwhile Col. Hay had a discussion on October 23rd -'ir# Martin. Mr. Martin asked to be sent more material about the Gulf, an~. this has now been done. Sii C. Gater has asked to see Col. Hay bn Monday October 28th, and it has been arranged that Mr. Donaldson should accompany him. The foreign Office have now agreed orally to the India Office taking over responsibility for the interim period (a letter of confirmation is/awuihid). The Treasury are, however, of the opinion that it would be better for the expenditure to be placed straight away on the vote ol ^the Department which will take the eventual responsibility and it is becoming clear that a decision on the eventual responsibility must in any case be reached'S^soon p^aerlble. There are various questions such as the building of a new Residency, the future of the postal administration (with which only the Colonial Office are apparently equipped to deal) which the India Office cannot decide without consultation with the Department of eventual responsibility. Other points for immediate consideration are set out in Col. Hay's note of 23rd October below. It seems that the oeso solution will be for the India Office to work hand in hand with the Department of eventual responsibility. It is, therefore, clear that the Departments concerned viz. the India Office, the Foreign Office the Colonial Office/40 Office and the Treasury must try to settle the question of eventual responsibility between themselves at the earliest possible date. . The a^B&amp;umngU-of individual— rflinisters concerned must also be obtained to future arrangements, even if the question is not submitted to the Cabinet. At an earlier stage it was suggested that the problem might be dealt with by the Middle Sast Official Committee (Sir E. Bridges was of the opinion^that it would suffice if ad hoc meetings of those chiefly concerned were called by the Chairman). The Chairmanship of the Middle East Committee is at present vacant, but I understand from the Secretary that a meeting of the Committee under some Chairman appointed for the purpose could be arranged. It may not, however, be thought desirable now to submit the matter to the Middle East Committee. Si 3o *//7^ Colonel Hay*s deputation period of one month expires at the beginning of November. It looks as though it will take some considerable time to get all these questions cleared up, and obviously he cannot stay until everything has been settled. It may, however, be considered desirable to extend his period of deputation for a few days until we are clearer how things will work out. It seems, however, that in any case we must wait until Col. Hay and Mr. Donaldson have seen Sir G. Gater on Monday before deciding what the next step should be. Meanwhile we might forward copies of Col.

I quite recognise that if the Colonial Office are not willing to give us their support now, v/e had much better hold our fire until the time comes for the transfer to be made from the India Office (if we are folding the baby' in the transition stage) to another Department.

George Gater, G.C.M.G., D.S.O., Colonial Office, London, S. W. 1. A ' \ thanks for your letter of 5th October about the future responsibility for relations with the Arab Principalities in the Persian Gulf. I see that you are far from enthusiastic about the prospect of the Colonial Office shouldering this responsioi±ityj we fee^. rather strongly that a solution on these lines, when the time comes for ministers to taKie a decision, is the right one (&amp;Jkr we certainly could not* pi eroH^it 'i. f -yoa- we re • ♦amrilling^o -suriport -etg»--v4«w. The considerations which you mention in your third paragraph are of course important ones, and ii the Foreign Office feel that the reactions of the U.S.A* or .the u.S.S.R. were lix^ely to be so unfavourable as to be a decisive factor, we should nave no more to say. But we should rather expect them to share our view that the organs to be employed for the exercise of H.k.'s jurisdiction in ohese btates, ^whicn is derived from * treaty, usags, sufferance, grant, etc.^are a matter for H.m.G. alone to determine, and that any foreign Government v which sought to intervene could properly be told that it had no right to question our authority to make such arrangements as we thought appropriate for the exercise of the King*s prerogative. Nor again, should we expect the rulers - except perhaps jhe Sultan of Liuscat - to offer any objection to , this proposal. .Ve are fortified in this view not only by the opinion of the present Political (CobfyiJ. ) kesident^who assures us that a majority of the rulers might, very well prefer the Colonial Officeto the Foreign Office, since the latter might be rather too tender to the interests of the formidable neighbours of the Sheikdoms (Iraq, Persia and Saudi-Arabia) but also by that of two of Colonel Hay's predecessors. Sir £• Prior and Sir H. Biscoe. The former’s views are on record in a letter of 15 th May of which I enclose a copy (Biscoe died without / recording his opinion, but this is given in Prior's letter). The Sultan of Muscat is in rather a different category from the Sheikhs, as he is* technically a fully independent sovereign ruler with the right to separate foreign relations; but if he should object we should not take that too tragically and are confident that the difficulty could be got over. I think that perhaps the nature of the work that will in future fall to , when the Government of India are eliminated from the control of the Golf administration, is not lUlly appreciated. It may perhaps be true, as you say, that the most important questions arising in the G-ulf are those which relate to the 'politics of oil” and the relations of the Arab Principalities with their powerful neighbours. The external asi^ects of these questions will of course fall to .be handled by the Foreign Office; but then, such external matters always have been dealt with by the Foreign Office, as the channel for ii*M.G-.'s relations been guided, to a greater or less degree, by the advice of the India Office and of the G-overnment of India as the authorities responsible for the political direction of .-.--.G.'s relations with the Arab rulers. But the great bulk of the work, albeit the less important and pressing problems, will comprise questions of an administrative character or matters concerned with with Foreign pov/ers, though naturally our domestic relations with the rulers. In other words.( /l/o ^ ^ “ ^ tUuMtA^i. 6m' f ttrrttj •• 1^-“' r »• -JCmoi W. &lt;k^T &lt;Avt ^ ^ ]4^, A&gt;^0**wCo the oiiange that has now been approved by the Cabinet is that the responsibility (including the financial cost now borne alioost entirely by Indian revenues) for administration (but not for external relation^r political direction which will continue as hitherto) should be transferred from the Government of India to H.M.G. We consider that these functions should be voefre-d in one Department, which obviously cannot for very long '’or the reasons rh, continue to be the India Office, which I have already indicated, our strong feeling is tnat this .Department should be the Colonial Office rather than the Foreign Office;but if you are not inclined to welcome the prospect, we had better not mention the possibility in our forthcoming talks with the Foreign Office and Treasury. We recognise that^in ary case^the Foreign Office will continue, as hitherto, to be very closely associated with the management of our affairs in the Gulf because of the reaction of those affairs on foreign countries. ' ,r e are at the moment engaged in discussions with the foreign Office and Treasury on the question of tfie Parliamentary Vote^r Votes / on which the expenditure involved in the maintenance of the Persian Gulf posts should now be borne. In this / connection, you may care to see the enclosed copy of a letter which we have sent to the Foreign ^•^ ce proposing a Tneeting (which it is intended that Colonel Hay snould attend; to settle this question. As it is probably better to treat the interim and long term arrangements together, if the Colonial Office are to be in the picture as our /possiblem possible eventual heirs, they ought perhaps to be represented, v/ith a 'watching brief', at the forthcoming discussions. But I should certainly not press you to arrange for this if you felt any difficulty about it. Ci^ X s. Please see Sir George Gater's letter of the 5th October, below. Col. Hay lias seen this and his comments are that while the majority of Sheiks would see no objection to the Colonial Office taking transfer, and might even welcome it on the grounds that they would be more likely —v. than the Foreign Office to resist the claims of Iraq, Persia and Saudi-Arabia, the Sultan of Muscat might possibly not be so keen. On the general question of Foreigi Office versus Colonial Office, a letter from Sir Geoffrey Prior, dated the 15 th May (of which we are alleged to have been sent a copy, but have not received one) has been shown us by Colonel Hay, and if is attached belov/. T is presses strongly for the work to be taken on by the Colonial Office and is much in line v/ith the view at which we had arrived here independently. It might perhaps be worth-while for/: lent e»th to send a reply to Sir George Gater on the lines of the attached Sir George Gater, if only to correct someSof the more glaring misunderstandings which his letter shows thht the Colonial Office have. It looks as if they are by no means anxious to take over the political direction of the Persian Gulf posts, SO that if the Foreign Office are in a 'grabbing* mood we maj have to be prepared for a fight. But perhaps this can be put off' until the time comes for the India Office to disappear if we can get the Treasury to agree that^during the transition period^ the India Office should’Viold the babry. n ' draft. I certainly think that a re joinder'should be sent toOffice of the Political Kesident, Persian Gulf Carap, Bahrain. the 15th May, 1946. The Hen’hie Sir Geoffrey Prior, K. C.I.S. , Political Resident, Persian Gulf. The Secretary to the Government of India, in the External Affairs Depannent, New Delhi. Sir, , I have the honour to say that the question of staffing of the Indian Political Service posts in the Persian Gulf may arise in the future and my views upon them may he of interest, owing to my long connection with these v/aters. 2. I once discussed with the late Sir Hugh Biscoe the possible effect that political changes in India might have upon the Gulf posts. He expressed the view that if the political direction was ever taken away from the India Office and the administraticn from the Government of India then our logical successors were the Colonial Office. With this view I have always been in complete agreemoit. SSCTOT Ko. C/69 from , To 3. Since the early years of this century there have been many occasions when the interests of the Gulf Shaikhdoms have b en threatened and it has always been found that when they were endangered by a larger power the Foreign Office almost invariably ranged themselves upon the side of that larger power. It will be recalled that in the life of the late Sir Percy Cox that he is quoted as having said ’’the Foreign Office are not interested in Muscat'. In this case the desire was to placate the French. Since then Saudi Arabia and Iraq have entered the field, and it is only the fact that these Shaikhdoms have been resolutely supported by the Government of India and the India Office (and at qne time the Colonial Office,) that they have survived at all. It will be recalled that in 1936 the Foreign Office urged that a substantial, portion of Qatar should be presented to Saudi Arabia so as to sweeten Ibn Saud in his attitude over Palestine and it was only the strongest opposition that overcame this proposal, which was not merely ethically unjustifiable but totally unnecessary. It is obveious that if the Foreign Office were once charged with representing the interests both of the small Gulf States and their larger neighbours that their larger neighbours would succeed in every clash that occurred. 2 ^ ’V/ith regard to the supply of personnel the case is even clearer. I believe tl 51 ^ ' t ^ ie °T officer at present provided is far more suitable than any ’’skat we shall obtain from other sources, and I trust that it will be available for man y years to come. They have a good knowledge of administration, ^ the application of the Indian codes upon which these States' organisations are founded and further most of the officers clready have an S^rience of State life before they come to the Gulf at all. Further they are familiar both with Indians and Indian vernaculars which play a large part in Guli^ life, since the local trade interests are pre-eminently bound up with those of India. Should, however, the supply of these officers at any time be interrupted, it is only from the Colonial Office that substitutes can be found, administrative probkns are daily becoming more important in these ohaikhdoms as they steadily develop, and these can only be solved by officers with administrative training and executive experience. Officers who have been trained exclusively under the Foreign Office have many gifts,'and foreign nations readily pay tribute to their ability, but their training runs on totadly different lines, and their executive experience is almost invariably nil. In other words t^ey pass their lives as spectators and reports and if they perceive a conflagration it is their function to report it and not £© F ut 10 ou '* Furthermore/• i 2 - Furthermore it is frequently necessary that the officers in charge of the political interests of these principalities should counter the encroachments made by neighbouring States and oppose them with all possible emphasis. An officer who owed his pre: eiment entirely to the Foreign Office and was merely temporarily in the Gulf would find it difficult to idtaitify himself with the interests of the * bnaikhdoms and would almost inevitably be unduly sensible of the requirements of the larger States with which the Foreign Office would automatically associate themselves, 5. The present arrangement by v/hich the interests of His Majesty’s Government in the Gulf are handled by the India Office, who have a long tradition of successful dealing with these problems, has certainly been in the interests both of these States and the Fmpire, and will, I trust continue indefinitely. Should any change be contemplated, however, I urge that for the reasons given above, the proper alternative would be the Colonial office and not under any circumstances the Foreign Office. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Sgd) GEOFFREY IRIOR Political Resident, Persian Gulf.•''i, My dear Monteath, v^U /JM ^Uci 1 Colonial Office, ^ Downing Street, S.W.l. F 5tti October, 19U6. 6837 4R Martin has shown me your letter to him of the 28th of September. I am most grateful for the information which you have given to us in your letter and in the note which you enclosed with it. I recognise that the functions of the officers at present supplied by the Indian Political Department resemble those with which we have been familiar in certain parts of the colonial Empire, including for example at the present time the Aden protectorate. As regards supplying staff, i do not think there would be serious difficulty on our side, as i assume at the outset we should be able to take over some of the existing staff as a going concern, and the immediate demand upon us would be comparatively small. On the other hand, there may be political objections to bringing them under the colonial office. The sheiks may regard this as derogatory and the transfer to the Colonial office may be regarded or interpreted by the U.S.S.R., the U.S.A. and others as an 'imperialist' move on the part of H.M.G. Also, the principal questions arising in the Persian Gulf seem to relate to the politics of oil and relations with Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia, with which the Colonial office is not concerned. For these reasons it may well be better if the responsibilities were taken over by the Foreign office, though we might, if desired, give some assistance by seconding suitable officers from time to time from the colonial service. While I can raise no objection to your proposal to suggest that the possibility should be borne in mind Sir David Monteath, KCB.,*KCMG., CV0., OBE., NV ,0 ,.”33 ‘ ~ S S' ^ ■ v r vy ' cS vJl mind of the responsibilities in question being shouldered by the Colonial office, you will no doubt have regard to the comments which I have made on the political aspect of the matter* I I have of course no knowledge of the attitude of my new secretary of State.IfU. &lt; Xjc^oJdte^^ rutin .s ,, . . . , Colonial Office. ilfideatial ' 1 23th Septoaber, 1946* r Ay ddiA* fJntC* , I wjnd, as you asked the other day. a very s omary st 'ietaent of the staffs rmintalned In the Persian G- If olitical Uesidenoy and the rolltioal Agencies bordinate to It.

( II - POLITICAL AG iCIxli (K0W3JT, BAHRAIN &amp; MUSCAT)Sir Williaa Cro Ur. Donaldson . 5 As I have mentioned to Mr. Donaldson, I ran into Ur. Martin (Colonial Office) today and had some informal talk with him about the matter dealt with in this draft, taking the line that the India Office would be quite prepared to 'carry' the Persian Gulf for the time being, but that ultimately no doubt the responsibility would have to pass to another Department of H. i. G. and it was an open question whether it should pass to the Foreign Office or to the Colonial Office for the respective reasons indicated in the draft and in discussion with you. I added that»I had had it in mind to write quite informally to Sir George Gater raising the issue in a perfectly tentative manner, but that it was one preferably for oral rather than written discussion at this stage. Mr. Martin said the point was quite new to him, but he took it very readily and said that he would have a word with Sir George Gater either this afternoon or Monday with a view to having some non-committal conversation about it. In view of this perhaps the draft below should be held up until there is some sign of reaction from the Colonial Office to this conversational approach; but if it is desirable to lose no time in getting on with the question of the financial obligations which have to pass to the British Exchequer - irrespective of the ultimate Vote to which should be allocated - perhaps the draft letter might be cut down by eliminating the discussion about the Colonial /OfficeOffice vis-a-vis the Foreign Office as the ultimate repository and proceeding on the assumption that for the time being the India Office would be content^ to carry the matter on its Vote. (Incidentally I learned from Mr. Martin that contact with the Yemen is maintained through Aden, but that the business done with the Imam is of a very small order in no way comparable with that handled with the Sultan of Muscat, and that Aden is in fact no more than an occasional post office.)Draft Paper. Department. H, A. Gaccia, Esq, , C. M, G-., Foreign Office, 9 &amp;G, /£ 8, Oarlton House Terrace, S.W. 1. I am not sure Aether you intend to circulate a record of the meeting held in your room on 11th September to discuss action to be taken on the recommendations in the Cabinet Paper CP(46)329, have already sent to T.J.

For this reason, and- also because the question has arisen in practical form already, I think we should now make up our minds on-a recommendation to the Treasury as to the vote on which the cost of maintaining the Residency etc. is to fall when the control of the Persian Gulf posts is taken over by H.M.G. from the Government of India in accordance with the Cabinet decision. first attention ought really to be given 2. It seems to us, however, that our or later, have to take over. subordinate posts.

Until May last, the Political Resident had his Headquarters at Bushire in Persian territory (where, since 1878, he had been recognised by the Persian Government as Consul-General). He is now, however, by Cabinet decision, restricted to exercising his functions on the Arab shore of the Gulf and is camping out in temporary accommodation in the Naval Base at Jufair (Bahrein). He has been forced to incur certain expenditure estimated at about £ 2,500 on adapting the naval buildings for his use, but you will see from the enclosed letter to Winnifrith that the Government of India will not Supply funds for the conversion of these buildings; first^because the Cabinet decision to move the Resident’s,Headquarters from Bushire was taken in spite of their strongly expressed disapproval, but also because they (in the person of Weightman, the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affaire Department) know that H.M.G. are very soon going to take over control of the Residency. We are accordingly asking the Treasury if the expenditure may be sanctioned. 4** -The Political Resident lias local charge of H.M.G’s relations v/i-th the principalities of the Persian Gulf, (all of -which - except Muscat - are British Protected States and none of whose rulers - except the Sultan of Muscat - have any direct foreign relations); he is not therefore a 'diplomatic' Representative. He is moreover responsible for a mass of internal administration v/ork, most of which has been dealt with hitherto by the Government of India but some of which has to come home for approval. As examples of this I would mention that the Political Resident is responsible for the control of the movement of foreigners,Draft Paper - Department 1 the functioning of thp local Agency courts (in respect of/British subjects and protected persons) where Indian lav/ is applicable, sijpervision of the v/orking of the oil companies', civil aviation and telecommunications concessions, and quarantine administration. It is also likely that responsibility for lighting and buoying in the P^G-. and for the postal administration in the Sheikhdoms and Muscat will also have to be taken over by the Home Govemiiient, Aparfvfi'om these matters, there is of course the financial administration of the establishments, the posting of officers and the recruitment of subordinate staff, for all of which the P.R, is at present responsible to the Government of India* 5. Eventually either the Colonial Office or the Foreign Office will presumabjr have to take over the Residency and all its works as a charge on its vote, but ov/ing to the necessity for a transitional period during which the Government of Indian control could be gradually transferred, and because of the hitherto predominantly Indian character of the administration, it may be thought convenient that this transfer should, during the transitional period, be supervised by the India -Office, the cost being/being borne on our vote and defended in Parliament by our Secretary of State until the transfer of control and absorption of personnel etc, is complete, 6, I expect you will feel that this will require discussion with the other departments concerned and, meanwhile, I am s ending^copi^b of this letter to Winnifrith at the Treasury, As to the subsidiary question when such discussion should take place, we think that it -would be more profitably conducted if we had the F.

Do you agree? (regarding future policy in Persia) X adhere to the view that in all political matters His Majesty's Consul Khorramshahr should be under the supervision of Consul-General at Ahwas. In administration matters subject to the viewsof the Government of India he might, I suggest, remain as heretofore under the supervision of the Political Resident. Under the present arrangement the post at Khorrarnshahr is inevitably overshadowed by the massive organisation of the Anglp-iranian Oil Company at Abadan. A closer association with Consul-General Ahwaz would however strengthen rather than weaken Consular* represent ation in the Company^s sphere.

Ambassador, Tehran, that while ^ situation in South Persia remains tense the transfer of the Residercy from Bushire to Bahrein should be deferred, we told the Political Resident to oo nothing until the Foreign Office had obtained from the Ambassador the elucidation of his recommendation which they felt it necessary to seek, xhe Ambassador has now telegraphed (his telegram 11 69 .A of 28th July) that he does not now wish to press his recomnendation,which has been overtaken by events, and suggesting that the original decision should stand, i.e. that transfer should take place forthwith. 1 have ascertained that the Foreign Office are somewhat naturally/ intending to stand on this decision and there is therefore nothing for us to do but to inform the Political Resident that the original decision for immediate transfer should stand. As regards publicity, it should not be necessary for the Resident to say any more than he has already been authorised to say, viz. that he is for the time taking up his headquarters at Bahrein. I understand that 2,tr. Weightman agrees that this is the only thing to be done.

We do not think that.there can be aqy doubt about the meaning of Le Rougetel's reoomaiendation for postponement of transfer but If you have any doubts in the matter are prepared to agree that he might be asked to elaborate as in paragraph 1 of the draft* The recommendstion In his telegram No. 781 has novr clearly been superseded and in the circumstances we feel that paragraph 3 of your draft might only confuse the issue. This question should* in our view, be reserved until such time as a final decision about the location of the Residency has been reached. 3. As regards paragraph 2 of the draft we feel that it would be unfair to tell Colonel Hay that he nay make an annomoement In the terms suggested without at the same time telling him that Le Kougetel has re-opened the question of postponing the transfer. In the circumstances he may well consider it better to make no announcement at all, since, as you point out, even such a limited statement would probably be taken as confirmation of His Majesty's Government's intention to remove the Residency permanently to Bahrein. Would you kindly let me know as soon as possible whether you agree to our telegraphing to Hay as in the enclosed draft.

The Foreign Office telegraphed (their telegram No. 694 ) to the Ambassador asking him to elucidate, to which the Ambassador replied (his No. 9^8) that while the situation in South Barsia remains tense the transfer of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrein should be deferred. This is in accordance with the view which we have been urging for some time but to which the Foreign Office have been resolutely opposed. We have just obtained from the Admiralty the release of most of the buildings in the Naval Base at Bahrein for the new Residency and the Resident must now be in the act of taking them over. From the draft telegram which the Foreign Office have now sent over for our concurrence they seem to be undecided, but I do not think it will be possible now to go back on the decision to transfer the Residency. With regard to the draft Foreign Office telegram, this seems to be in the main aiight. As regards paragraph 3, however, we have just received a telegram from the Government of India on the future of consular^ representation at Bushire (their telegram No. 60 h 6 on file below). We might take this opportunity of mentioning the Government of India's attitude and a paragraph is included in the draft letter to the Foreign Office submitted. A draft telegram to the Political Resident is also submitted. This follows the suggestion in the Foreign Office draft telegram that Col.Hay should be authorised to say only that he will for the tiras bein g take up his headquarters at Bahrein.

While case against maintaining Political Resident on Persian soil has been established it would I suggest'be a grave error to throw away position built up at Bushire over so many years. ¥e have much to lose by an abrupt break with the past. It would for instance be deplorable lo leave former Residency derelict because the new encumbent could not afford to live in it. This would be interpreted as due to a policy of scuttle and effect would be particularly pernicious at the present time. Our attitude should be that we are voluntarily giving up what is no longer in keeping with the times. But are maintaining to the full our legitimate position and influence. 2. I suggest therefore that Busbire should be filled by a Consul General having supervision of [grp, undec.] Consulate posts in South Persia. He would be parallel to the Consul- General at Meshed and would carry out similar political and commercial duties. He should I consider live m residency but work in the Consular Offices in Bushire town. He would of course give up any 'pro rata Consular' customs, e.g. with regard to flag flying which may still remain at Bushire and would in general conform to Consular practice elsewhere in Persia. Mr. Galloway would be an excellent first appointment.Mr. Cletirv . ' c h Under Secretary of State. Transfer of Political Residency Please refer to India Office telegram No, 11318 and to Political Residents telegram HoTj232 and see the Foreign Office*s two letters of 2nd July oelow, one of which encloses a draft telegram. The Political Resident* s telegram T/2fi^ 2^2 has now been received. The lower of the two Foreign Office letters is somewhat obscure. From conversation^, however, I understand that they are anxious that the Political Resident should not get rid of the supporting staff from Bu shire as it may very probably be decided to keep a Consulate General there after all. The Government of India recomnended some time ago that it rat^fbe reduced to a Consulate but the Ambassador, in his telegram No,781 flagged on attached file, recommended the retention of a Consul General, Moreover it seems undesirable at the present Juncture ; when H.M.G. are contemplating the adoption of a more active line in Persia to announce the withdrawal of the Residency and to imply that^their interest in this part of Persia is in any way diminished. perhaps, therefore, we should ask the Political Resident to hold his hand a little longer although it is clear particularly from his telegram T/223~ that the position has become awkward for him. 32Z A draft telegram to the Political Resident is submitted accordingly in which it is proposed to obtain Foreign Office concurrence before despatch.

KwihuAX (^) Note bv Mr. Donaldson, dated 18th June I do not think this will in the least pacify the Viceroy and the Government of India, but in the circumstances described below there is no more to be said. I offer no comment on the private telegram but suggest some changes in the- draft official telegram. Note bv Sir D. Monteath. dated 18th June I have no further comment to offer on the situation that has developed. How have we come to accept the P.O.'s descrip tion of the P.it. as an administrative officer? It is quite as incorrect so to describe him as it would be to imply that the Pol. Resident, Hyderabad, administers that State. And it seems that the F.O.

Moateath, Bushire Residency Move With reference to letter dated 13th June from the Private Secretary at the Foreign Office, Mr. Henderson spoke to the Prime Minister about this yesterday and found that the Prime Minister is not prepared to support him against the Foreign Secretary on the issue of Colonel Hay being allowed to go to Bushire. Mr. Henderson feels, however, that he may reasonably expect some latitude in the matter of the date for the completion of the transfer. In the circumstances Mr. Henderson feels there would be no noint in going to Cabinet again and thinks we had better now telegraph to the Government of India.

No opportunity occurred, however, and he has asked me to let you know his views. He feels that the Soviet Government may well raise on some international occasion the V question of the presence of a British administrator in P ers i aD territory (you will no doubt have % [seen recent references in the Soviet press to IBushire) and thinks that it is important that our position shall be clear. At present, if this question were to be raised, we have a clear and good answer: that the present Political Resident is not in Persia at all. Mr. Bevin considers it essential to maintain this position ^ and therefore regrets that he cannot agree - that Colonel Hoy should now go to Bushire. He also hopes that the transfer of staff and archives from Bushire will be effected as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, M.J.

CABINET LOCATION OP THE HLiAOQUARTERS OP THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF ( Previous papers C.P.(46)101 and 103 ) Memorandum tjy the Under Secretary of State for India G* y v«ft J CAli At their meeting held on 14th Marcd the Cabinet the papers noted above, and it is recorded in the Conclusions (c.M.( 46 ) 24th Conclusions minute 3^that '‘the general view of the Cabinet was that, in view of the extreme delicacy of the situation in Persia, it was desirable, despite the admitted difficulties, that the Political Resident should cease to exercise his administrative functions from Persian territory as soon as possible'*. At the end of the discussion the Cabinet “agreed that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should cease forthwith to have his headquarters on Persian territory”. 2. This decision was ccramunicated to the Government of India, and^tbe Political Resident, with instructions to submit recomnendations for carrying it into effect pending the consideration of plans for constructing permanent headquarters for the Resident at Bahrein. The Goverment of India and the Political Resident have now reported, after a detailed examination of the physical difficulties involved: — 'pf&gt; 4T Hu (a) That the laew is not possibl^until the autumn of this year at the earliest, and (b) That the personal supervision of the new Resident (Colonel who Inna jtwt^ succeeded Sir G.

GofaS, ^Avc^J ^ fcv/G^J^ /* • v/* 6. In a personal telegram of 23rd May the Viceroy has represented that y ’’all other considerations apart, unless H.M.G. provide^ assistance by releasing temporaiy accommodation in Bahrein (e.g. S.N.O* s house) Resident is being invited to carry out a physical impossibility* 1 . Lord Wavell adds that his Government “have been very badly treated by H.M.G. over this, and must really request that realities of situation are faced'. 7. In view of these representations I have no option but to ask the Cabinet to reconsider the timing and ccnditions in which the move is to take place,|otherwise the administrative machine in this important part of the Middle East, where bo#h H.M.G. and the Government of India have substantial interests - strategic^:, political and eccndmic - cannot function effectively, and those interests are likely to suffer.V - 3 - Co 8* If the Cabinet/agree tliat the completion of the move should not take place until the end of the year, when temporary accomnodation^at Bahrein may be expected to be ready for occupation, the question arises whether Colonel Hay may be allowed to go to Bushire in the interval for the purpose of organising the move, and planning the separation of the two sides of the joint office. He cannot, without grave embarrassment vis-a-vis the local Persian authorities, to whom he is personally well known, go there as a private individual; nor can he go in the capacity of Political Resident - a title which the Persian G-overnment have never been expected to recognise on Persian territory. If he goes at all, h e must be appointed H.M. Consul-General, Bushire, o/l rr^L a*/-*/ / /and be accorded recognition in that capacity. The Poreigi Office have not been willing to seek the agrement of the Persian Government to this appointment, since they fear lest, if the Political Resident does not confine his operations to the Arab side of the Gulf, we expose ourselves to the criticism that we are keeping on Persian soil an officer, one * of whosexjunctions is to supervise our relations with the British protected states on the Sjuth Western shores of the Gulf. 9. This criticism has, however, never been made ty the Persians, either officially or in the Persian Press, though almost every other form of anti-British propaganda has been exploited against us in Tehran. The Foreign Office admit, in the light of the fact that similar fears expressed in 1939 (when the last change of Political Resident took place) were ccmpleteiy falsified, that 'it is not impossible that we might safely reach the autumn' without the matter being raised. I think myself that this is a risk which might reasonably be taken. Sven if the Persian Government should raise the matter - which I believe to be unlikely - could they not be told plainly (as the Government of India propose) that H.M.G. have, for good reasons of their own, already decided to remove the Residency^to Bahrein, but that the transfer required the supervision of a senior officer, and must involve a short /WcKUiS* ) delay which will be all the briefer if their consent to Colonel Hay* s appointment is accorded at once. 10 ./- 4 - 10. My recomi-jendations tlierefore are as follows: (a) The G-oveminent of India should be informed that the removal to Bahrein must take place, and must be completec^j, by the end of the present year. (b) The Admiralty sjaould be invited to release acpoflinodation in the Naval at Jufair to enable the Resident to set up his headquarters re on the completion of the move, £) H.M. Ambassador at Tehran should now be instructed to seek the Persian Governments agrement to Colonel Hay*s appointment as Consul General, Bushire, in order that he may arrange for the removal of the Residency Office to Bahrein with Mhe ninimmi of ^ffil t Tnvtni onrr, ^ , 1literal effect to the canclusiun that the chinge •ftoali take pi ice f ithwith. The outward telegrams (’ an.] 'G') we e enpatched after coomltation with the Foroiga Office. 3. Both the Political Resident - n the Govei anent of Iniia iKi|K)i T t t alter a detailed exa dnation of the physical aifllculties involved - (a) that the move is not &gt;o.;aible until the autism of this year at tho earliest and (b) that the personal supervision ol tn^ new i esidont \ (Colonel fiay) is required at ishire in or. er to enable it to be car ri d out. The detailed considerations which have influenced tho local authorities in read ing their conclusion that immediate removal is not practicable, &amp;ie set out in the telegrams. I attach a note ( nnexure 'J') vhidr 'uravarlses and coraaunts on these detail d points. I m myself strongly impi’essed wit the . j d i , i .0 ' .v 1 ,\. an e hitherto closely integrated functions of the Residencying period between now and the erv of t ha year for the and the Ooratlate General at Juahlre, without either giving adeMU te tliae xor the proceas or allowing the separation to take pi ce under the eye of the responrible head oi the hitherto co ablned ad ilnistration 4* I tv ve received a strongl^ -worc ed personal telegram IToa the Viceroy dated 23rd lay (Afinoxure *1') in which he says that * the,Resident is being invited to carry out a physical iapos ibility”, and complains that his Government 'have bean very badly treated by H.XG. over this*'. 5. la view ol‘ thlsS, I have no option but to ask that the tiling and conditions in .Men the move is to take lace should be reconsidered. If this is not done. the administrative mac tine in this important part of the Middle Last, where both H.M.G. .and the Government o„ In ia have substantial interests - strategic. politic d and economic - cannot function effectively, and those interests are likely to suffer. 6. A o racial oint is whether or not Colonel Hay m y be allowed to go to . ushire for the short intervenpurpose of orgrii 'ing tha love and planning the ' separation of the two sides of' the .joint office. He cannot, witnout grave embarrassment vl/wv-vis the iocnl Persian a thorities, to whoa he is pe sorvuly well known, go to Bnahlre as a private inulviciual; nor can he go in the cn ncity of Political Resident - a title '/hich the Persian Governaent have never been expected to recognise m Persian territory’.

It is recognised and regretted that H.M.G, ! s decision to transfer headquarters from Bushire to Bahrein before permanent accommodation has been found or built at latter must entail a considerable measure of dislocation and inconvenience for Political Resident and his staff, I fear, however, that, for reasons given in paragraph 2 of my telegram March 21 at No, 5793, 1 s decision must stand. 3*. Consequently Hay cannot he appointed to perform Consular functions at Bushire, and move will necessarily have to be carried out without his personal supervision. It is not accepted as essential that the Political Resident should himself supervise the arrangements for the transfer to Bahrein cf the staff and archives at presentiat Bushire. 4, Consular supervision over posts in South Persia staffed by Indian Service Officers could not well be exercised from Bahrein; and if Consul, Buahire, cannot be put in charge of this, perhapa work could be undertaken by Skrine from Tehran', necessary subordinate staff being transferred with the work. 5, New Residency at Bahrein cannot in any case be constructed for at least two years; temporary arrangements must therefore continue during intervening period. Possible solution might be to combine Residency and Agency offices to some extent and so isave space. Alternatively, Resident might take over Agency and Political Agent move elsewhere, 6, Foreign Office do not now propose to inform Persian Government cf new arrangements, and procedure suggested in paragraph 3 of Bushire telegram No. 472* March 27th, will be followed.

My large office staff, many of thorn are married and have their families with them, cannot be expected to bivouac on the sands or under the palm trees in the height of Bahrain hot weather* It is further out of the question for my staff to share the stuffy and already over crowded Agency offices, as proposed in para No*5 of your telegram 96/0 of May 22nd. 4, I am at present living in'Political Agency, cut this arrangement is unsatisfactory and would he quite impossible owing to limited accommodation if either the Political • Resident or Political Agent had his family with him* It would be grossly unfair to the Political A gent/and incidentally cause him much loss of prestige., to expel himvfrorn the Agency which comprises his house and offices and is well situated and designed for his work* even if alternative accommodation were available. Agency must remain in its present central situation, whereas it is desirable that Residency should be at a distance from Manama.. 5, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, has informed me that it has been decided that his successor should have his •' headquarters afloat and that he has recommended that naval base at Jufair should be abandoned except for two buildings and some recreational grounds from the time his successor is due v to arrive, viz. , the first half of July , I strongly recommend that all the accommodation vacated should be made available for the Residency and its staff, either temporarily or permanently.. The Senior Naval Officer's house is suitable as a residence for Political Resident temncrarily and couldwith additions and alterations be converted into a permanent ^.'‘esidenoy* 6* I would urge immediate steps be taken to ensure that ^accommodation at naval base-, including furniture and fittings, is made available for Residency, its staff and officers, as soon as it is vacated-. Until this is done it is impossible even to plan the move from Bushire. 7* X cannot say what proportion of staff can be accommodated at Unfair until a detailed survey of buildings is carried out, but they should meet most of our needs provided all living accommodation and offices other than the two buildings mentioned in para* 5 are placed, at our disposal, 3* Even if these buildings are made available by middle of July. I trust that I shall not be expected to move all staff across at once at worst season of the year.

In view of the latter two telegrams it is submitted that the question should again be submitted to the Cabinet and a draft paper is attached accordingly. Meanwhile an interim reply has been sent to the Government of India referring to our-jelegram No. 9^70 and saying that the matter is being.rurther oonoidored. An amended reply to Sir Orme Sargent* s letter of 20th May is also submitted for Sir D. Monteath* s signature. (Seme further oaxmxents by Sir G.

There is undoubtedly much in what he says and it is not altogether new to us. 1 .'w-C Ua^CoCL. 2dMr. Henderson Transfer of Persian Gulf Residency from Bushire to Bahrein Please see the Minutes on the reverse of the docket. The last few telegrams received from the Government of India and from Colonel Hay, the newly appointed Resident, do, I think, show that it is a physical impossibility to effect the transfer of the Residency witnin several months. • It is fantastic to attempt to move the large staff and the records, etc., required for the performance of functions on the Arabian side until there is office and living accommodation available, and it is quite clear that there is neither, and will be neither for some months, it is an additional consideration that, even if the accommodation were available at Bahrein, this is the worst possible time of year in which to undertake such a task. That is the main consideration. The second, with which the attached minute deals, is the blank refusal on the part of the Foreign Office to take the necessary steps to Colonel Hay the official position,for the time being,of Consul General at Bushire to enable him to supervise the work of that part of the move which has to be developed at Bushire. We have gone /M 11 gone carefully into the question whether there is some officer who could deputise for Colonel Hay at Bushire while he super vises the reception end at Bahrein, and this solution also is found to be non-existent. The draft minute, therefore, presses that the Foreign Office should now seek for the agr^ment of Colonel Hay and, in the very unlikely event that the Persian Government make any difficulty about it, should explain that it is required only for the comparatively short period which the division of the Residency's functions will occupy. This, which is mainly an administrative question, hardly seems suitable to put back to the Cabinet, whichAts takfnf; the political decision underlying it; and I understand that your view is that the best course is a minute to the Prime Minister, with a copy to the Foreign Secretary, so that the matter may be settled between them. 28. 5. 46.&lt;XT- bUllefib. DRAFT MINUTE from MR. HENDERSON to PRI!.iE MINISTER PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY References: C.P. (46)101 and 105; C.M.(46) 24th Conclusions, Minute 3. In C.M.(46) of 14th March, it is recorded that 'the general view of the Cabinet was that, in view of the extreme delicacy of the situation in Persia, it was desirable, despite the admitted difficulties, that the Political Resident should cease to exercise his administra.- tive functions (i.e., those on the Arab coast) from Persian territory as soon as possible'. The 'conclusion' recorded is that the Cabinet 'agreed that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should cease forthwith to have his headquarters on Persian territory'.

The outward telegrams ('A' and 'G') were despatched after consultation with the Foreign Office. 3. Both the Political Resident and the Government of India report, after a detailed examination of the physical difficulties involved /2 . involved - (a) that the move is not possible until the autumn of this year at the earliest; and (h) that the personal supervision of the new Resident (Colonel Hay) is required at Bushire in order to enable it to be carried out. The detailed considerations which have influenced the local authorities in reaching their conclusion that immediate removal is not practicable, are set out in the telegrams. I attach a note (Annexure 'J') which summarises and comments on these detailed points. I am myself strongly impressed v/ith the formidable problems involved in disentangling the hitherto closely integrated functions of the Residency and the Consulate General at Bushire, without either giving adequate time for the process or allowing the separation to take place under the eye of the responsible head of the hitherto combined administration. 4. I have received a strongly-worded personal telegram from the Viceroy dated 23rd May (Annexure 'I') in which he says that 'the Resident is being invited to carry out a physical impossibility', and complains that his Government 'have been very badly treated by H.M.G. /—H.M. G. over this'. 5. In view of this, I have no option hut to ask the matter to he reviewed. £ao not suggest that the decision to remove the Residency from Bushire should he reversed (though this was taken against the considered advice both of the Government of India and l»#*d Pethick-Lawrence before he left for India), but I do ask rthat the timing and conditions in which the move is to take place should be re considered. If this is not done, the adminis trative machine in this important part of the Middle East, where both H.M. G. and the Government of India have substantial interests- strategic, political and economic - cannot function effectively, and those interests are likely to suffer. ^ A crucial point is whether or not Colonel Hay may be allowed to go to Bushire for the short intervening period between now and the end of the year for the purpose of organising the move and planning the separatior of the two sides of the joint office. He cannot, without grave embarrassment vis-a-vis the local Persian authorities, to whom he is personally well known, go to Bushire as a private individual; nor can he go in the capacity /■Hjj| IJU-J- -v'^r' 4. capacity of Political Resident - a title which the Persian Government have never teen expected to recognise on Persian territory. If he goes at all, he must te appointed H.M. Consul General, Bushire, and be accorded recognition in that capacity. The Foreign Office, basing themselves on the conclusion that the Political Resident should cease forthwith to have his headquarters on Persian territory, have not been willing to seek the agrement of the Persian Government to this appointment. They express apprehension lest, if the Political Resident does not at once confine his opera tions to the Arab side of the Gulf, and v/ere to install himself at Bushire, we expose our selves to the criticism that we are keeping on Persian soil an officer one of whose main functions is to supervise our relations with the British-protected states on the south western shores of the Gulf. 'j-fy. Though this has for many years been the position, this criticism has never, in fact. if; been made by the Persians, though almost every c Usxr- j form of anti-British propaganda has been exploited against us in Tehran, (-The functions discharged by the Political Resident are not relevant to the extravagant Persian claim to Bahrein which could, of course, as on previous occasions / rioccasions, be demolished on its merits.) Q am inclined to doubt whether the Persian Government attach as much importance to the point as the Foreign Office make out; they (the Foreign Office) expected this criticism to be made in 1939 when Sir G. Prior was appointed Consul General; but in the event nothing of the sort happened. The Foreign Office themselves admit that 'it is not im possible that we might safely reach the autumn' without the matter being raised. I think that they underrate the atprobabi 1 ity'f5. But even if the Persian Government should raise the matter, I do not see why they cannot be told - as the Government of India we»iu suggest- that we have already decided to remove the Residency Office from Bushire, that the transfer requires the personal supervision of Colonel Hay at Bushire, and that the move will be made all the sooner if their consent to his appointment as Consul General is forthcoming without delay. 8. My recommendation is, therefore, that H.M. Ambassador at Tehran should now be instructed to seek the Persian Government's agrement to Colonel Hay's appointment as Consul General, Bushire, in order that he may arrange for the removal /removal of the Residency office to Bahrein with the minimum of dislocation and inconvenience Colonel Hay should be instructed at the same time that the removal must/take effefitQnot late tharj the end of the present year. I would also ask for the co-operation of the Admiralty in securing the early release of accommodation in the Naval Base at Jufair, near Bahrein, to enable the Resident to set up his headquarters there, and carry out his administrative tasks. 9. I am sending a copy of this Minute and its u* Annexures to the Foreign Secretary and to the Admiralty.DETAILED CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING ’IHS REMOVAL OF THE RESIDENCY. (a) Even temporary accommodation cannot 'be arranged for the Residency at Bahrein until the autumn at least. The staff of the Residency con- t/v# £&gt;3 sists of about eight senior officials, apart from a large subordinate staff, and a formidable problem is therefore involved in providing the necessary accommodation for them and for their families. The housing problem at Bahrein, already serious, has become more acute with the influx of families of the oil company's staff, and it will be necessary for other accommodation, e.g. in the Naval Base at Jufair, to be released in order to provide for the Residency. Accommodation in the Naval Base is expected to become available in the first half of July, and could be adapted for use by the Resident and his staff for living and office purposes, but some structural alterations will be necessary before it can be occupied. \ (b) The records and.files of the Residency are com plicated and bulky. Since the Residency lias hithertc dealt with questions arising on both sides of the &lt; &lt;S-va , Gulf, including such matters, as financial control, shipping and supplies, the files will require a great deal of sorting out-under the Resident's personal supervision if his activities are in -future to be confined to the Arab shore. It is really quite unreasonable to expect a new Resident toC+~A’(t~4 1 *- -, , (a AaJ~&gt;a- J - &lt;&gt;U M IAU. »- S^UW' ' i_ '' cJ f £J:’U^^ deal with the Arab States without having all the necessary papers to refer to, particularly at a time when regular communication between Bushire and Bahrein is limited to tv/o sailings a month each way. The Political Resident, who in obedience to H.M.G.'s instructions, has located himself at Bahrein, reports that'he is in an impossible position for the discharge of his functions. A (c) Climatic conditions at Bahrein are at their worst at this time of the year and do not become tolerable for life under camp conditions until October or November.INWARD TELEGJR'A*' A llotted t o Ex t ern a 1 De J pa. rtf ;ent Copies Circulateci. l?rom Govemraent of India, External Affairs Departnent.

Sir Orme Sargent's reply has now been received (dated 20th May). It rejects our request for a postponement of the move and adds little that has not been said before. It is for consideration at a higher level 'whether the position must now be accepted. If so the draft telegram below Sir 0. Sargent’s letter might issue as amended in pencil in the light of Col. Hay’s telegram of Idth May. (Col. Hay is now at Bahrein where he has just taken over from Sir G. Prior). Note bv Mr. Donaldson r dated 21st Mav. 1946 U.S.S. , There is nothing more that we can say to the F.O. if they simply rest on the Cabinet decision and thrust aside all considerations of practical administration. Hate by Sir D. Monteath. dated 22nd May.1946 Mr. Henderson . In the light of Sir 0. Sargent's letter of 20th May there seems no option but to send the Government of India the telegram originally desired by F.O. but amended slightly in the light of Col. Hay's telegram of 18th May. I propose to send a copy of it (when despatched) to Sir 0. Sargent under cover of the letter the draft of which is below the draft telegram. The Viceroy will be furious: he has already shown much annoyance at the cavalier way the Government of India have been handled - not as a Dominion Government would be: and for myself I think he has some justification. At an earlier stage you asked whether there was not some 'deputy' at Bushire who could supervise the business instead of the P.R. himself. .Ve investigated this by d.o. telegram and received a reply on 5th May from the P.R. and 7th May from the Government of India that this was not practicable. / /^ P L t f t F*/&lt; .* * * ■ ‘ * ■' i d / / k A {' - if u-vC ✓t-w * ‘i « V-v-Y tf\ i-a llu IC it, t hO / Ji -Since you spoke to me the other day about the location of the headquarters of the political Resident in the Persian Gulf i have carefully considered the points raised in your letter of the 4th May. in commenting on them, I should like to deal first with the political point raised in your sixth paragraph. Obviously it is not impossible that we might safely reach the autumn without having had any trouble over the presence of the political Resident at Bushire. it is surely equally obvious that there is a risk of such trouble arising, for we certainly cannot exclude the possibility that an agitation against the exercise by the Consul-General at Bushire of administrative functions on the Arab side of the G^lf might be raised either separately or as part of a campaign to discredit us if the Persians were to decide to press their claim to Bahrein, it was in view of these possibilities that the poreign secretary suggested in the paper which he submitted to the cabinet that it would be much better to remove the political Resident from Bushire immediately in order that our diplomatic position should not be impaired by the existence of this weak spot, it should not be overlooked that the Russians are conducting an all-out offensive against us in the Middle East and it is surprising that they have not already seized upon the anomalous position of the Resident at Bushire to make trouble for us directly or through their Persian stooges. Mr. Bevies view, which we consider that the cabinet decision has endorsed, was that the appropriate time to make the necessary changes was immediately after the withdrawal of our troops from Persia, when our Treaty of Alliance with Persia came to an end and the Persians became, as far as we were concerned, masters in their own house. The/ Sir David Monteath, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.-O The expiry of sir Geoffrey prior’s term of office affords in our opinion an appropriate occasion to make the break. if his sucessor as political Resident, whether substantive or acting, confines his operations V to the Arab side of the Gulf and does not instal himself in pushire as Consul-General, then we are no longer exposed to the criticism that we are retaining on Persian territory an official whose main function is the supervision of our relations with the British- protected states on the southern side of the Persian Gulf, in our view, therefore, colonel Hay, the new Resident, should remain outside Persia, and the question of obtaining for him an agr&amp;nent from the Persian Government does not arise, to ask for his agrdment might well provoke the persian Government to raise the whole question. I appreciate that until the whole Residency office and staff can be transferred to Bahrein there must be dislocation in the workings of the Residency and inconvenience for its staff. I very much regret this, but do not feel that we can recommend that the Cabinet decision should not be implemented because of that, with regard to the practical points which have been raised by the Government of India, I fear that I am not convinced that it is essential that the political Resident should himself supervise the arrangements for the transfer to Bahrein of the staff and archives at present at Bushire. Nor do I feel that it is impossible to make the arrangements out lined in paragraphs 3, U and 5 of your draft telegram to the Government of India work. we/ •W© therefore favour the despatch of the draft telegram to the Government of i'n'dia. I am sorry that we should not be able to meet you in this matter, but I hope you will appreciate the force of our reasons for sticking strictly to the cabinet decision.% III OPIATE. By hand. 18th May, 1946 Dear Howe, Monteath wrote to Sargent on the 4th May about the location of the headquarters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and sent him a cliaser on the 6th May emphasising that a speedy decision was desirable on the question raised. We have now received from Hay, who has just taken over from Prior at Bahrein, the telegram of which I enclose a copy. This shows that he finds himself in a totalling impossible position if he is unable to'-yb to Bushire as Consul-General to organise and super intend the move of the Residency to Bahrein. He would like to cross to Bushire by the 'Nearous', sailing about, tiie 22nd May, for the reasons he gives in paragraph 6, and we very much hope that it may be possible fox’ him to do this, but that will mean that an approach will have to be made to the Persian Government asking for provisional recognition. I am writing to you rather than to Baxter, because I understand from the Eastern Department / R. G. Howe, Esq., G.li G. foreign Office, S.W.l.Department that the paperr. have reached you on their way to Sargent. V'hen Monteath • spoKe to Sargent a day or two age, he had not then seen the file, so I presume that it is still with you. Yours sincerely. (Sgd.) E. P.

We have found Foreign Office at departmental level very difficult but are exerting pressure at higher level. Main p©±nt sst difficulty at lower level has been requirement that Hay should be appointed Consul General so as to give him offidial status at Bushire for purpose of supervisirig transfer operations oh Persian side. We are likely to be faced with counter suggestion that Consul could do this quite adequately in correspondence x UroutKJu with Political Resident^at Bahrein; and we should be grateful for argu ments of weight in elaboration of last sentence of your 3865 to show that this latter arrangement could not successfully be adopted.4th !iay, 19^6 / I v/rotc to you on the 22nci : 'aroh about the moans oi' giving effect to tlie Cabinet decision of the 14th March about tlio location of the he?id- marters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Since thou, the Internal Do-Kirtnent of the India Office lias been discussing with your Eastern Department the terns of the renly to be returned to the Governuont of India's latest / telegram No.3865 of the 27th April, a copy of which I enclose for ease of reference. 2, The draft icd represents the line which I understand that the liastern Departient would wish us to tace with the Government of India. I laa bound to tell you, however, that I do not, myself, agree with it and that I should feel great difficulty in recommending it to Mr. Henderson for approval. 3. In the first place, v/e feel that in sufficient attention is being paid to the serious practical difficulties which both the Political Resident and the Government of India have pointed out, and that we ought not, without better xeascre than have been advanced, to overrule the Govern ment of India in a matter in which they have reached a considered conclusion in the light of Sir Om reports / 1, S.ff. 1.reports fi*ora officers on the spot who alone are In a position to judge the full effects of the steps pi'O'nosed. You will notice, too, that the telegram has had the Viceroy's personal approval. 4. (uite frankly, the arrangements indicated in paragraphs d, 4 aixi 5 of the draft apiioar to uq wholly unpractical. You will roaeaber that tiie 'coaclusion''* recorded in Cabinet hinutes CM(46)34 of Uie l^itii fjarch that the Political Resident should cease forthwith to ivive his headqur-rters on Persifin territory aerives from the general view of the Cabinet, as recorded in the sana ninutes tliat it was desirable tlvit tlie P-liPical Resident should cease to exercise his adainistra- tive functions from Persian territory as soon as p ossible. Is it not reasonable to interpret ‘^forthwith* as moaning as soon as the competent authorities on the spot can make it practicable? o. If tiie move could be postponed until tiie autiumi, as the Government of India propose, tills would at least mitigate to some extent the very great difficulties that are, in tiny case, in separable from the move, and - wiiat seems essential - enable it to be carried out under theeye of the new Political Resident; hut this does involve seeking toe Persian Government's agrSment to the appointment as Consul-General, Bushire, of Colonel Hay till such time, later this year, that he can sever himself finally from Bushire. I would most strongly urge that the Foreign Office refusal to take this step should he reconsidered. 6. Neither the Persian Government nor the Tehran Press lias yet made any criticism of the position of the Consul-Genera], Bushire, in his other capacity of representative for conducting His Hajesty's Government's relations with the Arab itates of the Persian Gulf. Is there any real reason to suppose that the fears which were expressed when a change last took place (in 1939) will not again he falsified or that the Persians, when approached, will not agree to the appoint ment without question? They will surely'not go out of their way to offend us at this juncture. If the present proposal for a move is carried out in the precipitate way now suggested, we feel strongly, with the Government of India, that His Majesty's Government's interests in the Gulf will certainly suffer. 7. I hope, therefore, you will he good enough to reconsider the matter in the light of what I have said above, and will consent to a reply being despatched acceding to the Government of India's request. (Sgd.)Sir Geoffrey Prior’s investigations into the way in which the Cabinet’s decision of 14th March can best be carried out (see his telegrams No#472 of March 27th and 601+6 of &lt;^pril 20th, in particular the latter) show quite convincingly that the move cannot be carried out until the Autumn without causing confusion and dislocation* The Government of India in their telegram No*3865 of 27th April agree with this conclusion and on the merits of the case there is really little more that can be said* If the move is postponed till the Autumn the immediate prospect of dislocation will be removed, though of course even then the accommodation at Bahrein is bound to be of a very makeshift nature and nothing permanent and satisfactory can be constructed for at least two years, even assuming that the neat*’ ^ question of financial liability does not delay things® In their telegram No#3865 the Government of India urge that the move should be postponed till the Autjjnn at least and that the Persian Government* s agreement for the appointment oxTIay as Consul-General, Bushire in succession to Sir G* Prior (who is due to hand over the first week in May) should be sought* reply to be sent to the Government of India was discussed with the Eastern Department yesterday and they showed no signs of agreeing to the postponement of the move as proposed by the Government of India* The Foreign Office of course have the Cabinet decision^ recommending that the Political Resident should cease'forthwith'* to have his headquarters on Persian territory^ on their side and it is useless to argue the matter further on the present departmental level* We agreed to draft a telegram JLn the sense desired by the Foreign Office and submit it here for In the circumstances the only course which can be suggested is for the Under Secretary of State to write to Sir Orme Sargent forwarding the draft telegram as agreed but asking that the lin e taken by the Eastern Department should be reconsidered* Drafts are submitted accordingly* After the meeting last Monday I undertook to submit to higher authority a draft telegram to give effect to the Foreign Office view, but I indicated that I could give no promise that tins would be accepted here as it involved overruling the Government of India, in a matter which ^ ^ had had the Yicercy’s personal approval, on grounds which seem to us/'to be flimsy. The crux of the matter is, of coirse, the Foreign Office refusal to seek the Persian Government’s agrement for the appointment of Colonel Hay as Consul-General, Bushire. The F.O. were firmly opposed to this mainly, I gather, on the ground that it would be indefensible for the Political Resident to acbninister from Persian soil a territory (Bahrein) which the Persian Government claim to be Persia’s. I argued that it would be equally objectionaule to the Persians for him to do this administration frcm Bahrein since, in Persian eyes, the Island is theirs; moreover, we had no evidence that the Persian Government objected to the Residency being in Bushire on the ground advanced by the F.O. But Mr. Baxter was not to be shaken^and we registered disagreement. I think, therefore, that the only course is^s Mr. __ suggests, for a letter to be sent to Sir Orme Sargent asking for the matter to be reconsidered. , / ^ fi. ^ ' C iA. ^ «Draft Paper Department.

It seems to me completely to expose the hollowness of their claim that this was a matter of great interest to the Persian Government and their admission that the Political Resident when on Persian territory is merely 'H.M. Consul-General at Bushire” --i ri 4 -- the validity of the argument on which we relied. It seems, however, that they are prepared to contemplate the removal of the Resident to Bahrein beirt; M a long process j but we cannot defer for very much longer a decision as to the future status of the consular post at Bushire on which the Government of India sent us an express letter three months ago, flag A in file attached. The alternatives seem to be either - (a) to ask the Government of India whether they wish to maintain their proposal for the retention of the post until 28th February, 1947 in the light of the new situation, or (b) to assume that Government of India will wish to continue the existing arrangements, pending the re-organisation of the I.P.S. cadre, and to approach the Foreign Office for their agreement to payment of a moiety of the cost. On the whole I think it would be as well to telegraph to India in continuation of our telegram of 21st I/Iarch as in the attached draft.

We feel, therefore, that it is unnecessary, and might even be dangerous f to make any special announcement to the Persians, who would be quite capable of trying to make capital out of the matter on the eve of his departure. I now see from paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s telegram No. 2993 of 30th March (Ext.2316) that the Political Resident himself is strongly against our allowing the Persians any official knowledge of the move before it is carried out. Since it appears that this will be a long process, it would be better to defer the question of issuing any official announcement, even in London, for the time being. We shall, of course, have to inform the Persians later on of any change which may be decided upon in the status of the consular post at Bushire or of its abandonment.CYPHER TELEGRAM (O.T.P.). prom Government of India, External Department.

There / Sir Ome Sargent, K.C.ELG., O.B. Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W. LThere is, of course, the suggestion made by the First Lord of the Admiralty in Cabinet that the S.N.O.'s bungalow mi$it be made available, ana this I am pursu- ^ / ing v/itli liarkham in a letter of which I enclose a copy. You will see, however, that we are not sanguine that this idea will prove to be anything more than a minor contribution to the problem of finding accommodation. The Foreign Office are not, I think, closely interested - at any rate as matters stand now - in plans for the future permanent Headquarters for the Resident, ana we propose to pursue this question separately with the Treasury and the other departments principally con cerned, but keeping the Foreign Office informed. It is likely, however, that, as an outcome of constitu tional developments in India, v/e shall have before very long to embark upon a complete review of the future administration and handling of British and Indian interests on both sides of the Persian Gulf, including the question of the division of expenditure between British and Indian revenues. b. As regards point (c) above, we take it that your Secretary of State will wish to inform the Persian Government of the Cabinet's decision without much delay. If so, we think that the Government of India should be given an opportunity of commenting on the terms of any comunicatlon it may be proposed to address to the Persians on this subject, (including an indication of the future status of the Consular post at Bushire and its /its relations to othur consular posts in south and south-east, Persia), and we should, therefore, be gl^ud if youi' Eastern Departaont could let Donaldson h ve the di'aft of the statement you would propose that His i.lajesty's representative at Teheran should make, so that ve !:iay tele^aph it to India.

I need not bother you with the details of qy correspondence, except perhaps to say that we are now consulting the Govern lent of India about the steos to be taiion locally to carry out the transfer of the Political Resident’s Headquarters to the Arabian shore and the Gi'roai/e k-nts which will be necessary, to provide make— shiit accomodation for hici during the inteiini period until a pertinent Residency can be built or found for him, d.

But that was against a rather different backgi’ound from that vrtiich is likely soon to be formed; and I suggest that with the possibility imminent of the Government of India ceasing shortly, in one way or another, to be amenable to control by His majesty's Government in tlie United Kingdom, the time has now come when these proposals should be re-examined vrith a view to determining what authority should in future control our administration On the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf and how that administration should be organised. It occurs to me that a possibly convenient course might be for the whole matter to be referred, by agreement between the departments principally concerned, to the Middle Bast (Official) Committee, under Cornwallis's Chairmanship, with instructions to present a repoi-t on it to Ministers. If the were agreed, it woula, I think, be necessary to ensure that all the interested departments were represented, and for this purpose I suggest that the Air'Ministry, the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the Ministry of Civil Aviation should be invited to nominate aa hoc representatives to the Committee. o.

The Cabinet decision of 14th March that the Political Resident should cease forthwith to have his Headquarters on Persian territory must now be communicated to the Government of India (repeated to the Persian Gulf and, by request of* the P.O., to Teheran) but the wording of the Cabinet minute is a little obscure and the word 'forthwith” is open to more than one interpretation. I suggest that the sensible meaning is that the move should take place without delay as soon as the necessary administrative details can be completed, and / in any case, not later than the date when Colonel Hay is due to take over charge of the Residency from Sir G. Prior. fAAty 4* ) I agree with Mr. Harrison that the three points for consideration are (a) the date of transfer of the Residency from Bushire to a place outside Persia, (b) the temporary arrangements to be made to accommodate the Resident staff and archives until permanent Headquarters can be found or built for him,and (c) what should be the nature of the announcement to be made to the Persian Government of this step. As regards (a) and (b) we must* I think, ask the Government of India to put up proposals in consultation with the Resident; we cannot make them from here^and although we have the somewhat light hearted offer of the S.N.O^s bungalow at Bahrein from the Admiralty, this is not going to be a major contribution to the solution of the problem. Apart from anything else, the bungalow is Situated some distance from Bahrein town in the centre of the Naval Base and cannot be regarded as suitable for the P.R^s Headquarters (whether it could be used to house some part of his staff or, if the P.A., Bahrein is displaced, that officer, remains to be seen). I suggest, therefore, that we should include in our telegram to India a sentence inviting them to make the best arrangements they can and to let us know how soon they can be put into effect. We should tell the/^br^U Foreign Office what we are doing and invite them to agree tkat/until we have proposals for the physical transfer of the ResidenZ|r to the Arab qVir&gt; ™» tw— — j gp HP ^ - The question of building permanent accommodation for the Resident is a separate matter in which the Foreign Office are not directly concerned and we should I suppose take this up with the Treasury as soon as possible. Sir W. Croft thought that the best machinery for examining the problem would be for us to raise it before the Mj^dle- East (Official) Committee and to get it considered by that body with the addition perhaps of representatives of the M.F.P. and Ministry of Civil Aviation who sire closely concerned with . the future set-up in the Persian Gulf. As regards a communication to the Persian Government there seems to be no reason why an announcement should not be made at once but perhaps we should give the Government of India an opportunity of commenting before the terras of the announcement are agreed with the Foreign Office. This might be reserved for a later stage when we have received a reply to the approach which it is now proposed to make to Sir 0. Sargent. The question will then arise whether we should take the opportunity now to resume consideration of the existing arrangements for the division of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and on the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf. This has been in abeyance during the war but the latest proposal from the Foreign Office was very briefly - ■ a '(a) that they should take over and pay for all the Consulates in Persia (except perhaps those in East Persia) and that India should appoint separate but subordinate consular officers to look after Indian interests; and (b) that India should continue to staff and pay for the Political Agencies under the jurisdiction of the P.R. in Muscat and the Sheikhdoms. The Government of India had put forward counter proposal^ of which the most important feature was a suggestion that expenditure on the Arab side should be divided between Indian and British revenues in the proportion 55:45. Sooner or later this question will require discussion and possibly the present may be a convenient opportunity to broach the matter so as to cover at least the interim period before a fundamental constitutional change takes effect in India. I now submit (a) a draft telegram to G. of I. for issue immediately if approved, (b) a draft letter to Sir Orme Sargent dealing with the points dealt with in the earlier part of this minute, (c) a draft letter to Sir H. Markham, Admiralty about the S.N.O.*s bungalow, (d) a tentative draft letter to Sir E.

They appreciate the practical difficulties of finding temporary accommodation on the Arab Coast during the period which must necessarily elapse before permanent Headquarters can be constructed for the Political resident at Bahrein. Nevertheless they are impressed by the extreme delicacy of the political situation in Persia and feel that the anomaly of British administrative officer exercising functions on the Arabian side of the Gulf from Persian territory might become a focus for anti-British agitation. They have therefore decided that Political Resident should cease to have his Headquarters on Persian territory forthwith and that the best means of giving effect to this decision should now be considered. 3.

The most obvious course, therefore, seems to be that removal from Bushire should coincide with Col.Hay taking over as Resident since it would hardly be physically possible for removal to be /6 effected in less than/six weeks or so still remaining of Sir Geoffrey Prior’s tenure. If this is agreed the Bafoyoifi Government might be informed of H.M. G-’s intention without delay. I presume that it will not be thought necessary to keep more than a Consul at Bushire in future, and in that case occasion to apply to the Persians for an exequatur for a new an&lt;?aynpi*te&gt;iii will not arise. I suggest that our coiimunication to the Persian Government need not say more than that have decided that the duties of Political Resident in the Persian Gulf which, as the Persian Government are aware, have in the past been performed by the holder of the appointment of H.M. 's Consul-General at Bushire in addition to his consular duties, will in future be exercised from a place outside Persia and that H.M.G. have at the same time decided to reduce the status of their Consulate-General at Rishire to that of Consulate. If you agree to the above the Government of India should of course be given an opportunity of commenting before any action is taken. 4. As regards point (c) in paragraph 2 above, the First Lord has been kind enou£$i to suggest that the Senior Naval Officers bungalow at Bahrein might be made available for the Political/3. Political Resident. It is not likely that a single bungalow would go very far towards meeting the accoraiiiodation requirements of the Residency and its present staff, but we should be grateful if, as the first step towards considering the Political Resident’s future temporary acconmodation J the Admiralty would let us have particulars of the accommodation which this bungalow comprises and the date from which it will be available. 5. As regards permanent r»ei,r,Teno^ for the future, the location of the Residency is only one of the questions connected with ^he/semrp in the Gulf which will have to be considered at an early date in view of the probability that an independent Indian Government will shortly come into existence. The general subject is, of course, a complicated one particularly in view of the interlocking of Indian and British interests with consequential arrangements for the division of the cost of administration between Indian and Imperial revenues^ both in Persia and on the Arab side of the Gulf. Ky Secretary of State suggests that the best way of dealing with this long-term question will be to refer it, with specific terms of reference, to the Liddle East Official Committee, by which means the Departments concerned might perhaps most easily be brought into consultation. I should be glad to have your views on this suggestion. - &gt;•, » -h ■/ 'f'' £ „/ -A' •‘t‘ ^ r'rA u b lr ^ r/ ' ^ tn DEPTL. No DRAFT TELEGRAM No CODE CYPHER Snuh.

The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Foreign Secretary (C.P.(46) 101) and the Secretary of State for India (C.P. (46) 105) about tte location of the headquarters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. THE FOREIGN SECRETARY explained that the main function of the Political Resident was to supervise the relations of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India with the British-protected Arab States on the southern side of the Persian Gulf. His Headquarters were, however, at Bushire in Southern Persia, and his status in Persia was that of a Consul-General. It was anomalous that a British officer exercising administrative functions on the Arabian side of the Gulf should live on Persian territory; and in present circumstances this situation might at any moment become a focus for anti-British agitation. He thought, therefore, that it was desirable to remove this possible cause of trouble before trouble in fact occurred. THE SECREtARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that the Government of India were opposed to an immediate change on account of the practical difficulty and expense of providing alternative accommodation at the moment. Moreover, the staffing and responsibility for all posts in the Persian Gulf would have to be reviewed after the impending constitutional changes in India. He did not himself dispute the wisdom of moving the Political Resident's headquarters from Bushire, although his presence there had not so far given rise to any adverse comment in Persia, but he suggested that a change might be deferred until the practical difficulties could be surmounted. The general view of the Cabinet was that in view of the extreme delicacy of the situation in Persia it was desirable, despite the admitted difficulties, that the Political Resident should cease to exercise his administrative functions fron Persian territory as soon as possibl e. Further points made in discussion were:- (a) There could be no objection to the exercise of the proper functions of a Consul-General at Bushire and it might be possible to appoint a separate officer to exercise these functions. (b) THE FIRST LGi.(D OF THE ADMLjVLTY said that the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf was in future to have his headquarters on bca’d a sloop, and his bungalow at Behrein could be made available forthe Political Resident. The Cabinet - (1) Agreed that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should cease forthwith to have his headquarters on Persian territory; (2) Invited the Secretary of State for India to consider, in consulation with the Foreign Secretary and the First Lord of the Admiralty, the best meansof giving effect to this decision.Private Secretary through U.S. o .

My Colleagues will appreciate that the Government of India, for obvious reasons, political, commercial and strategic, due to geographical factors, are closely concerned in any development affecting the position in S, Persia and the Persian Gulf: they have a specially intimate concern in the development now under consideration since the Political Resident and the Political Agents under his control are members of the Indian Political Service,, and the cost of the whole of the Establishment concerned with the reiatic i with the Arab Rulers on the Jest Coast is borne (except for a contribution in respect of Koweit) by Indian Reveniw 2 ? Shortly before the Foreign Secretary’s paper was circulated I had received a telegram from the Government of India (Annex) in the light of which I was about to send him a considered reply. I now circulate this telegra.i which explains the grounds for the Government of India’s view that the immediate removal of the Political Resident from Eushire, eves if it were practicable, is inexpedient and inopportune. 3 , Developments in the la,st decade or two, for instance, m connection with oil and civil air communications, have on the whole tended to increase rather than to diminish the_importance which has always been attached to our position in the Gulf, In making arrangements for the transfer of the Headquarters of the Political Resident, it is necessary to pay due regard to what will best serve our interests on the Arabian as well as o.n the Persian side of the Gulf. 4.

CABINET. f — LOCATION OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF. / Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. THE Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is a British official whose main function is to supervise the relations of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India with the British-protected Arab States on the southern side of the Persian Gulf. Ever since the eighteenth century his headquarters have been maintained at the port of Bushire in Southern Persia. To the Persian Govern ment his appointment is now notified as “ His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire,” and his title of Political Resident is restricted to the Arab side of the Gulf. 2. The objections to the appointment of this British administrator as a consular officer in an independent foreign country have long been recognised. A decision was reached some years ago that the Political Resident would have to transfer his headquarters to the Arab side of the Gulf. It was proposed to acquire a site for building a new Residency at Bahrein, but before any final arrangements were made, or any decision reached regarding the cost of the new building, the 1939 war broke out and the matter has since been in abeyance. 3. His Majesty’s Ambassador in Tehran has recently recommended that after the withdrawal of the British troops from Persia on the 2nd March, the Political Resident should be withdrawn from Bushire and should have nothing v , further to do with Persia. I have written to my colleague at the India Office strongly supporting this view. It seems to me that after the withdrawal of British troops from Persia on the 2nd March, when our Treaty of Alliance with Persia comes to an end and when the Persians once again become masters in their own house, we must probably expect a certain amount of trouble from the Persians. Russian influence in the country will be very strong, even if the Tehran Govern ment does not become entirely subservient to Moscow. Thus, we may have a great deal of anti-British agitation in Persia, carried out by the Persians themselves, but stimulated by Russian propaganda. 4. It may be expected that the retention of the British Political Resident on Persian territory will be one of the main points on which anti-British agitation will fasten. Obviously this out-of-date survival from the eighteenth century is bound to arouse against us all Persian nationalistic feelings. 5 . I think that British policy in Persia henceforward should be not only to respect the independence and sovereignty of that country and to encourage the Persians to uphold their own independence and sovereignty, but also to give the Persians no reasonable ground for criticism of our arrangements in their country, and to allow the Russians no weak spots on which to concentrate their anti-British propaganda. I feel that the presence of the British Political Resident in Persia will from now on be a vulnerable point in our diplomatic position. I regard his immediate removal from Bushire as a matter of real importance, and I hope that my colleagues will agree that it should be effected without delay. It is surely better, from every point of view, that we should withdraw him now, while we can still do so voluntarily on our own initiative, than to wait until Persian nationalism, incited by the Russians, is in full cry against us and we are obliged to withdraw him ignominiously after much anti-British agitation. 13187 [31434]2 6 . I should perhaps add that the Persians have for many years advanced a ridiculous claim to the Arab States of Bahrein and Koweit, which are two of the very territories with whose administration the Political Resident is concerned. The Persian claim to Bahrein has recently been loudly ventilated in the Persian and Soviet press and might give rise to a position where the presence of the Resident in Persia might be misrepresented in an embarrassing manner.

They say that in view of the impending constitutional changes, with the consequent necessity for a review of the whole question of responsibility for policy and staffing of posts in the Persian Gulf, they are not prepared to commit their successors to the expense of fiu transfer of the Residency, of the necessity of which they are far from convinced. They add that the estimated cost of transfer is now likely to be in the neighbourhood of 50 lakhs (£375,000), that nowhere on the Arab Coast is there temporary accommodation available and that at Karachi the Resident would be quite out of touch with the personalities and atmosphere of the Gulf. In the circumstances I think there is nothing to do but firmly to oppose Mr. Bavin*s suggestion for transfer until the question can be discussed with the future Indian Government. The possibility has occurred to me that the Political Resident might be provided with a yacht as part of a makeshift temporary arrangement (he would need some accommodation on shore as well) but I do not think that it would be at all a satisfactory solution and it would be better not to mention it to the Foreign Office. From our recent prolonged enquiries into the question of obtaining a yacht for the Political Resident it has emerged that the only really satisfactory solution would be to build one and this would take 18 months and cost about £ 150 , 000 . f /Aka* Jo***) It should perhaps be mentioned here that there have been recent indications in d.o. correspondence that relations between Sir R. Bullard and Sir G. Prior on official matters are at present far from happy and that the former is resentful of the fact IJjat., the Political Resident has a position irT'Persia that is eartawt co- equal with his own. I cannot help feeling that it is- this wk5^E'TsZbehind the Embassy's and Foreign Office's desire to get the Political Resident out of Persia and that the objections of the Persian Government to having a Political Resident on Persian soil are not the only considerations in mind. A draft letter to Mr. Bevin is submitted. I do not dissent from Mr. Harrisonfe draft at A which although somewhat stiff is I think fully justified by the views expressed by the Government of India on which, we understand privately, they feel strongly. But it may be thought that a somewhat different approach to Mr. Bevin may be expedient in view of the heat which seems to have been engendered by the recent correspondence. I have therefore prepared an alternative draft (flag B) which attempts to approach the problem in a spirit of ”sweet reasonableness'*. In either case, we should now press the Foreign Office to instruct H.M. Ambassador; Tehran to approach the Persian Government for their agrement to the appointment of Colonel Hay as Consul General, Bushire and I attach below^ draft d.o. letter to Mr. Baxter which might appropriately issue simultaneously with the letter from the Secretary of State to the Foreign Secretary.Draft Paper. external Department. The Rt. Hon'ble Ernest Bevin, M.P. , Foreign Office, S.W.1. In my letter of 28th February about the withdrawal of the Political Resident from Bushire, I promised to write to you again when I had received the Government You will see that the Governnent of India say that ; in view of the impending constitutional changes^ they cannot commit their successors to sharing in the expense of moving the Residency to Bahrain, of (although they uu j-v/ a.i i. j, they are far from convinced. That being their attitude as regards the permanent headquarters of the Residency, they report that there is temporary accommodation is available and that it would be quite impossible for the Resident to conduct his business fron Karachi; he might just as well try to | do it from London. I cannot help feeling that there is | a good deal of force in what the Government of India say about the long-term project. While the estimate of 50 lakhs (or £5^5,000) may well prove to be on the high side for a ^Residency in Bahrain, it would, of India*s views. These have now arrived^ in a telegram of 4th of which I enclose a copy. /X (10337) \Vt.l4054/i\164 10,000 i/39 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 (11764) VVt.2(J696/P.282 10,000 9/39I think, be out of the question for any Government of India, in present circumstances, to contribute from Indian revenues to this project. But if the Treasury are prepared to go ahead with the building of a new Residency - possibly on a to less princely scale - there seem^be no reason why plains and specifications shouldnot be drawn up (or the old ones revised) and the work put in hand without delay. The construction of new buildings at Bahrein will, however, as the Government of India point out, be likely to take anything up to three years and some solution must be reached regarding the interim period. I think we must accept the Government of Indies view that during this period the Political Resident cannot discharge his functions from a headquarters as far away from the Gulf as Karachi. The choice thus seems to lie between a makeshift arrangement under which the Resident would lead a nomadic life on the Arab shore without any fixed abode, and leaving the Residency where it is until the transfer to the new headquarters can conveniently be made. I am afraid that the first alternative is open to very strong objections. It would be a damaging blow to our prestige, which is of great importance in dealing with the Arab Rulers in the area, and would I am convinced gravely impair our influence in a region where we depend upon their goodwill for naval and air facilities and the maintenance of strategic oil reserves. It would incidentally result in a serious loss of efficiency and would impose an additional strain on officers already handicapped by the exceptionally trying climate of the Gulf. While I am willing to admit that the presence of the Political Resident's headquarters at Bushire is something of an anachronism which ought to be remedied, I wonder whether the position is quite so indefensible as you appear to think. /OnOn Persian territory the Political Resident has been - at least since 1878 - regarded by the Persians siraply as Consul General, Bushire, and the fact that a large part of his duties consists in supervising our relations with the Arab States on the Southern side of the Persian Gulf is surely a domestic matter with which the Persian Government have no official concern. Certainly that Government (though not perhaps the Persian Press) have always hitherto turned a discreetly blind eye towards these activities^ and I see little evidence for the belief - though I admit that it is strongly held by Sir Reader Bullard - that Persian amour J propre is affronted by the fact that, for purely practical reasons of convenience ^he Residency is J located at Bushire. I therefore feel strongly that whether or not we press on with the arrangements for establishing TfJL Resident on the Southern shore of the Gulf as soon as this is reasonably practicable (and this will depend upon funds being available) we should leave him where he is for the present. I do not think that it would be unreasonable to reply to any representations which we might receive, (jif the Persian^ attitude should be other than what we hopey to the effect that it had been our intention to arrange for the transaction of business concerned with our relations with the Arab States outside Persian territory and that but for the war this intention would have been carried out; we intend to proceed with the original plan as soon as convenient arrangements can be made. But I feel that we ought not to go to meet trouble /halfhalf way; similar gloomy forebodings which were made Ckb ^**,£**4^ in 1939 va/ the last change of Resident were not realised and I hope you will now agree to the Persian Government being approached for their agrement to the appointment (Lo Cq^JI of Colonel Hay ; who is due to succeed Sir Geoffrey Prior at the beginning of May. My Office is writing separately to your Eastern Department about this matter.DRAFT LETTER Rt. Hon.

Unless H.M.G. are prepared to take over the whole expenditure involved by a transfer of the Residency - a proposal which I^find it difficult to support - there seems very little to be done until we are in a position to come to some general arrangement with the future Indian Government about control and /expenditureA * expenditure in the Persian Gulf. I will, however, if you think it worth while, make further enquiries as to how far planning for the erection of a Residency at Bahrein has gone^ so that we may be in a position to go ahead with as little delay as possible if and when a final decision in favour of such a move is made.HP ' INWARD TELEGRAM A3. lotted to Donaldson - ‘ 6611* From To Dated.

H Foreign Office, S.W.l. Oi. zv 2 iSth February, 1946. I arn sorry to see from your letter of the 29 th January that you appear to advocate keeping the British Resident at Bus hire more or less indefinitely, while we argue about the control arrangements for the Persian Gulf when India’s foreign relations are taken over by an Indian Minister, and while we take steps to acquire land elsewhere for building a new Residency, and put other preparatory work in hand. I cannot agree that we can afford to delay action in this way. The position is, in brief, that.we have a British official responsible for certain administrative duties on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf, but established in Persian territory. The employment of this British administrator as a consular officer in a neighbouring independent country is objectionable in principle and highly vulnerable to attack, more especially in view of the Persian claim, however ill-founded it may be, to two of the Arab territories under this official’s jurisdiction. We cannot retain the Resident on the Persian side of the Gulf without running the serious risk of having later to withdraw him ignominiously at short notice, as the result of Persian agitation. March 2nd is the date when the British troops all * withdraw from Southern Persia, when our Treaty of .alliance with Persia comes to an end, and when the Persians once again oecome masters in their own house. I fear that, even though the Russian troops are similarly removed from Northern Persia, Russian influence ana propaganda m the country will be very strong. We shall have to expect a The night Honourable Lora Pethick-Lawrence. /certain cJ.{X U*Ui /Icertain amount of troaole from the Persians, even if the Tehran Government does not oecome entirely suoservient to the Russians, We ought therefore to put our affairs in order without delay. The objections to our attempting to maintain any longer our indefensible ano out ox* date arrangements at Bushire are very much stronger now than they ever have oeen in the past. In general, it is my policy m Persia to give the Persians no reasonable ground fox 1 criticism of our arrangements, ana to allow the Russians no weak spots on which to concentrate their anti—Bntish propaganda. I must oeg yon not to maRe dii'i iculties for me in this matter. The presence of the Political Resident in Persia will from now on oecome a vulnerable point in our diplomatic.position, and I must insist that I regard his immediate removal as a matter of real importance.Persia No. i (1942) TREATY OF ALLIANCE between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union and Iran (With Notes) Tehran, January 29, 1942 Presented by the Secretary 0 / State for Foreign Affairs to Parliament by Command of His Majesty LONDON PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY HIS MAJESTY’S STATIONERY OFFICE To be purchased directly from H.M.

Ua, Please see Mr, Bavin’s letter of 10th January below and Tehran Despatch of 19th November, flagged. It was, as Mr, Bevin says, agreed before the war that the Resident should remove to Bahrein when a Residency could be built for him there. The question was, however, tied up with the general question of the revision of arrangements for meeting the cost of diplomatic and consulate expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf, the Government of India insisting that they would only contribute 6 lakhs to the cost of the new Residency (the totalf^ras estimated then at 17^ lakhs) and that j only if their claims for the equitable division of expenditure generally were met. The matter has been left in abeyance during the war. 4 /U/Vva** Xa*' 1 * w-*'’ hyiY* ,, ,..4 21. There are certainly grounds of practical convenience for the removal of the Political Residency to Bahrein (he would be nearer at hand to the Arab States and communications with Bahrein are better than with Bushire) but he must have adequate accommodation and this I understand does not exist at present at Bahrein. I should very much doubt myself whether Mr. Bevin’s suggestion that the Political Resident might work from India will have much to commend it in the eyes of Sir Geoffrey Prior and the Government of India. Prom the point of view of prestige, which counts so much in this matter, it would look rather like a withdrawal of the Residency altogether. I think the Foreign Office and Ambassador are inclined to exaggerate the difficulties which the Persians are likely to cause us if the Residency is not withdrawn at once. In spite of the gloomy forebodings by the Foreign Office and Minister at the time, the Persians made no difficulty over the appointment of Sir Geoffrey Prior as Political Resident in 1939 and I have not heard of any particular trouble since.f In any case there seems no need to link withdrawal of the Residency with the date of withdrawal of foreign troops from Persia — March 2nd. I do not think that we should be rushed over this} any Persian criticism will have to be faced up to by the Ambassador. The Russians are certainly in no position to criticise although, of course, that does not mean so through their subsidized Persian newspapers, /LG - position to criticise the y wil1 not do Ikl t^ETnewsDaoers. ■ ' /la tu,'«*&gt;'■** i j\4 '(l*l' It&amp;tl In any case, it would seem clearly undesirable for the Secretary of State, without consultation with the Government of India, to commit himself now to the view that early withdrawal is necessary.

Hon. Ernest Bevin, M.P.. Foreign Office. Thank you for your letter No.£.9272/450/91 of 10th January regarding the removal from Bushire of the Headquarters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. t This raises a number of important issues, not all of which are covered in your letter. Among other things we are not at all sure as yet under whose control the functions of the Political Resident on the Arab side of the Gulf should be exercised when the external relations of India are in the hands of an Indian Minister responsible to the Indian Legislature. It is clearly necessary to obtain the views of the Government of India upon Bullard's proposals before we can come to any decision upon them. I am asking them to let me have a report urgently, and when I have it I will write to you again. I do not think, however, that we can hope to reach a conclusion before the 2nd of March, when the Allied Forces are due to be withdrawn from Persia, but I am bound to say that I cannot regard that date as having any•particular significance in this context. Meanwhile, the following points occur to me. A decision in principle has already been taken and what we now seem to want is a practical and agreed plan for giving effect to it. We should avoid equally anything that looks like either a hasty and undignified withdrawal or /deliberatedelibqrQte procrastination . If we can decide upon a plan and take the initial steps for carrying it out, such as acquiring land and putting preparatory work in hand, I see no reason why we should look for trouble from the Persians, Up to now similar fore bodings in the past have not been borne out by the event, and I don't suppose that the Persians will want to go out of their way to pick a quarrel with us just now. As soon as we have the views of the Government of India, your Department and mine and the Treasury must set to work to find a reasonable way of reconciling the extreme views.(E 9272/450/91) Important I write to draw your personal attention to Tehran despatch No. 399 of the 19th November last, a copy of which was sent officially to the India Office on the 30th November. In this despatch Sir Reader Bullard refers to the necessity for the immediate removal from Bushire of the Headquarters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. For many years it has been clearly impossible to justify the existence on Persian territory of the Headquarters of the British official whose task it is to supervise our relations with the British- protected Arab States on the south side of the Persian Gulf. This arrangement is a survival from the last ^ ' ' i . cen ^ u ry&gt; ^nd we can no longer insist upon keeping our ' Resident-* installed in Persia without taking any ^ account of Persian opinion. Indeed I think that even before the war it had been agreed that the Resident would have to move his headquarters to Bahrein as soon as fresh office accommodation could be built for him there. The main purpose of Sir Reader Bullard f s present despatch is to urge most strongly that the Political Resident should have nothing more to do with Persia after the withdrawal of the British troops from that country on 2nd March next. I think he makes out a very impressive case indeed. It would, it seems to me, be the height of political folly to leave the Resident there as a target for the anti-British propaganda of Persian nationalists, urged on by the Russians and their inspired Persian agents, we ought to withdraw him on our own initiative before a press campaign develops. The Right Honourable Lord Pethick-Lawrence. X/m I think it would be very bad for our prestige if we had to withdraw him later on as a result of Persian agitation; or if he were subjected to indignities or inconveniences, such as the cutting off of his telegrams from Bahrein, I shall be glad if you will let me have as Msoon as possible your agreement on this main point of principle. We can subsequently consider minor points arising out of the decision, e.g. the future status of the consular post at Bushire, the question what official accommodation may have to be constructed at Bahrein for the Resident, and the further question what arrangements should be made for the Resident until sufficient accommodation is available at Bahrein. On the last point, perhaps the best course may be for the Political Resident to establish himself temporarily in India; it takes less time nowadays, I believe, to reach Bahrein from India by air than from Bushire by sea.t/*7 FILE I 94b' ddi* ^ ) o&lt;* d .It, Wfh the Compliments 19 th of the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs 3 0 NOV 1945 I have the honour to roconaaanu that a epaedy solution should be found for a problem which hue been allowed to remain in suspense throughout the war • the transfer of the headquarters of the Folitical i£»sident in the Persian Gulf from i^ushlre to the ireb side of the Gulf* The history of this question is. I believe 9 as For a very long time the Political uesident hi follows. For a very long time the Political hesidont has had his headquarters at hushire y with supervision over the Political Agents at Uassat* Bahrain and Kuwait. This became anomalous and invited trouble when Keza Shah brought , about the abolition of the Capitulations and in other ways also began to follow an intensely nationalistic policy. The humiliations of those days are vividly remembered by all \ those who had ary connection with this ^art of the worlds the '' latest was Inflicted on us of the iota / ^ war, wi^en the Persian Goverment called upon us to remove the stump of a flagstaff at Buahire wiiich, being in the ground and 7 Jv not on a builuing t was comaiderec to constitute an affront to Persian sovereignty. It was eventually agreed between His Majesty's Government and the lover ment of I nolo that in future the Resident should bear the title of 'His Majesty's Consul* /u a*,**} General at Buahire'^in Pisaia and should restrict the use of X his title of Heal dent to the Arab side of the Gulf. L&amp;ter ^tu f*** it was agreed that the Heal dent shoalu have his permanent (S'?# - headquarters at Bahraln 9 whez^e a x^esiaency would be built for him. Plans for the new residency were drawn up f but discussion of the very high estimates of coat tied not been completou whan tl*e outbreak of war in 1939 caused the subject to be dropped for the time being. The Kesioent spends a considerable part of the year at places where he is in fact the iuisident 9 but for the rest of the time he lives at But hire where, besides being Consul- General for the Buahire consular district, he continues to operate as heel cent for certain territories which are outside Persia. 3. In my opinion It Is so important to sever the last link between the Political Resident and Buehlre that the severance ought to be effected very soon (preferably before the departure of the last of the British troops from Persia. i.e. not later then t!orch 2nd 1945 ) and should not wait until the united treasuries of Great Britain and India can afford to build at Bahrein a residency satisfactory to all parties - s task which was found to be extremely difficult before the war and is not likely to be easier now. 4, nothing infuriates oriental countries like Persia more than to have to deal with “residents ^ who are pictured as the sinister western Influence behina puppet governaent*. This prejudice was strong enough in Afghanistan to coapel the American Goverwaent to give their fixwt representative at Kabul the title /of The lii^tit Honourable r rnest 1 evin, k.P., His Majesty's Principal Secretary of Stcite for Foreign Affairs, Foreign cffice 9 ^ xiu «ii-X - h .

The causs of friction should be removed from his reach, unless some over- rising interest makes this impossible or highly undesirable, there is no overriding interest in favour of the retention of the headquarters of the Political resident in the rersian Gulf on reraisa territory* on the contrary, every political consideration is against it* and to Issve it taere, once the British troops have left and the Persians ore again masters in their own house, 1 , /would be, I consider, unpardonable political frivolity. Our ^litical stock is high in Persia at the Doaent. 1 his is due in the main to parochial considerations - most of all to the fact that we are showing up well in comparison with the Russians and even in comparison with the Americans, who have ; shaved in a manner which appears to the Persians greedy and over* bearing in the negotiations about assets. s must not however coimt on the permanence of this feeling, or a impose that it would protect us from annoyance In the matter of the vJLsgulsed resident posing as a Consul-General at Buahire. Even e friendly Persian boveroment might not be sorry to have a legitimate complaint to riuke against us, as a sop to the opposition. It would be a popular uemand that the Consul-General at Bus hi re should be that and nothing else. &amp;• There will not be lacking people seeking occasion against us - the Persians we have had to intern; Persian “my officers smarting from the memory of the ignominious part they played in August 19*1* Persian naval officers who have not forgotten that aomo units of their fleet were sunk by the British forces, without warning, with soa* of their comrades on board) Journalists seeking for sensational material and for the chance to slow heroism without risk. Moreover, all this potential hostility will find encouregement in overt or uiu^en foviet propaganda. Shy should we leave an important hostage in potentially hostile Bonus? In esa :: hah 9 s time you scare safe unless it suited him to attack you, for he kept everyone else quiet. fee cannot foretell how things will develop when the foreign troops have left Persia, but it seems likely that whatever happens the press will be free enough to bait Ms majesty*s Govenment about Persia Irreaenta, especially Bahrain. References to this fantastic claim are becoming ccnmon, and they are now sharpened by the smell of oil. During the war the Fersians have founc it convenient to let this claim sleep, but they are beginning to make themselves a nuisance again, and not only in the press: Bahrain pilgrims bound for Meshed finu their Bahrain passports an ee&amp;Larrosament to them in Persia Instead of a reccmmenuation. The Persian claim covers Kuwait also. Cnee again the British subject wishing to visit Bahrein or Kuwait as wen as Persia has to carry two passports, since the Persians will not recognise a foreign passport which bears an endorsement for Bahrain or Kuwait (parts of Pereia, as they allege) as well as for Persia.

The only reaction which it is possible for rae to suggest is of 3s. 83,000/-, the estimated cost of a bungalow for the Residency Surgeon. In view of the factjthat there are now a number of doctors in Bahrain to one of whom a retaining fee could be paid for services to the Hesidency Staff it would I suggest be possible to abolish the post of Hesidency Surgeon in which event a house will not be required for him. 3. The abolition of the post of Hesidency Surgeon will necessitate the appointment of a second Assistant Sur geon as the one Assistant Surgeon already in Bahrain, and for whom quarters already exist, will not be able to attend 411 the members of the Hesidency Staff in addition to performing the duties of Chief Ouarantine Medical Officer. The appoint ment of a second Assistant 3u geon will not however affect the estimates as provision has already been made therein for an Assistant Surgeon. 4. This saving will however be offeet by the cost of air-conditioning tho new buildings for which I observe no provision has been made in the estimates. I regard air- conditioning of the new buildings as absolutely essential in view of the noisome hot v/eather climate of Bahrain. This is distinctly worse than that of Delhi, where, I understand, this benefit is being provided for those officers who remain as the result of the curtailment of the Simla exodus. e endeavoured to obtain estimates of t e cost of providing- 2 - of providing suitable air conditioning from the Bahrain Petroleum Company, which has been the cause of the delay in replyir *5 to your letter, but the coat of such plant depending on so many varied factors, they have only been able to furnish figures so approximate as to be of little practical value. 6 . I assume that the Grovernment of India will accept the principle that air conditioning is essential. On hearing that ray assuraption is correct I will depute my Assistant Engineer to proceed to Bahrain and obtain from the 0 il Company the figures for the cost of air conditioning. On receipt of these figures it cac then be considered whether the Oovernraent of India would care to send an expert in air conditioning to Bahrain to confirm the figures obtained by the Assistant Engineer.

Reference x&gt; ara £ ra ph 3(1), a copy of a statement received from the Political Resident, Persian Grulf showing the European and Asiatic staff to be accommodated is enclosed. No regulations exist on the subject of the scale of accommodation to which the staff is entitled, but the practice usually followed is to design residences in accordance with the status and salary of the officers or clerks who are to occupy them in such a manner that dovemnent will not lose by the transaction. The cJb maximum rentf which an officer or a clerk can be called upon to pay is 10% of his salary and the return '/tfiich Government aim at obtaining is 6% on their capital outlay. A residence is therefore so designed that this percentage on the capital outlay will be roughly equivalent to 10% of the average monthly pay of the officer or clerk who is expected to occupy it. This is the principle which has been fallowed in the present case, although no rent will in fact be recoverable, and the Thief Engineer to the Government of India consider^ both the scale of accommodation and the cost of the various residences as provided for in the project suitable and in order.

Revision of pay of Office Establishments in Persia and Persian Gulf. Revised pay and allowances proposed by Resident are on liberal scale, but having regard to bad climate and lack of amenities in Persia and Persian Gulf and great difficulties in recruitment, we recommend that proposals should be accepted subject to following modifications. Firstly. We recommend pay of extra Assistant Resident Bushire be fixed at rupees 475—25—600, to mark out the post as senior appointment in Persia and Gulf. Duty allowance of Rs. 50 would not be drawn. Secondly. We consider that the post of Treasury and Accounts Officer, Bushire, should be made permanent, but that pay of 300 Rs—20—400 should suffice without duty allowance proposed by Resident. Thirdly. After consultation with Resident we have decided that local allowance shall not be given to all posts, and recommend following scale:- Bahrain, Mohammerah, Dizful, Kerman, Shuster, Head Clerks, whether first or second grade, 25 Rs; other Clerks 15 Rs per mensem. Muscat, Bunder Abbas, Head Clerks 50 rupees, other Clerks 25 rupees per mensem. Local allowance will not be drawn by locally recruited men while serving in their homes. Fourthly. We are recommending that financial control of Kermanshah shall be resumed by the Foreign Office and we do not include Kermanshah in our present proposals. Fifthly. We do not consider it necessary to continue appointment of British Officer as British Vice Consul at Kerman butrecommend retention of appointment of extra Assistant Resident, in which case head clerk will not he required. Responsible subordinate is necessary to free Consul for touring. We consider free quarters or house rent allowances must be given, as accommodation of suitable type is scarce. Making number of posts non pensionable in 1912 very seriously affected recruiting and we consider it essential that all clerical posts shall in future be pensionable. Ultimate cost of this proposal will be about Rs.920 per mensem. Extra cost of proposals excluding pensions is about Rs.5000 and (sic) per mensem taking into account cost of temporary staff at present entertained. Adjustment in office allowance due to bringing certain posts on to pensionable establishment will be made. We request that you will sanction proposals as modified and move His Majesty’s Government to accept moiety of cost in case of Persian posts. Reference to distant posts has entailed delay and we recommend that effect be given to revision from 1st November 1920. Please reply by telegram.* /. 1 IGOiffIDMTIAL .

No. a 4 &lt; £ ,17497/4. j At the meeting at the Foreign Office on the 14th December about diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf 5 you said that you saw no prospect of the Government of India agreeing to contribute more than 6 lakhs towards the new Residency at Bahrein. We note from the Government of India letter of the 12th November, 1937, that the increase in the estimated cost from 12 lakhs to 17^ is mainly due to the fact that accommodation will have to be built for the clerical staff. As the Government of India would have contributed 6 lakhs to an expenditure of 12 lakhs, this means that His Majesty’s Government will meet the whole cost of this living- accommodation, and we assume therefore that the rents payable by the staff will be credited in full to His Majesty’s Government. We should be glad to know what rents would be charged for each type of quarters to be provided. 2. As I said at the meeting, the insistence of the Government of India upon limiting their contribution makes J.P. Gibson, Fsq., India Office. itr it neceBsary for us to examine the plans and estimates in much more detail than would have heen necessary if the Government of India were prepared to meet a proportionate share of the cost, since they will no longer have any financial induce ment to plan economically. 5. After further consultation with the Office of Works we do not think that it would he useful or practicable to send an architect to Bahrein, but the Office of Works will advise us here about the plans and estimates, and for this purpose we should be glad if the Government of India will transmit to London by air mail the following particulars:- (1) A statement showing the numbers and grades of European and Asiatic staff respectively to be accommodated. If the scale of office or living accommodation to which any of the grades are entitled is laid down in regulations, particulars should be given. (2) Site . Was an option on the site selected ever taken? The last reference in our papers seems to be the Foreign Office letter of the 14th October 1937, E.939/649/34. Particulars of the area and location (i.e.distance from town) should be given. Is any levelling or other preparation requiredrequired? If so, estimates of the cost should he given. Has the nature of the subsoil been investigated by trial holes or otherwise? (5) Plans . We shall require a copy of the plans of each floor and sectional drawings to show the heights of the rooms and elevational drawings, if these have been prepared, and we shall also require a block plan of the site to show how it is proposed to orientate and position the respective quarters of the new building scheme. If any alterations or additions have been made which are not included in the plans, particulars should be given. ( 4 ) Estimates . How have estimates been framed? Has this been done on a cubic foot or a superficial area basis or by taking rough quantities of the different materials plus labour costs? Estimates for each building should be given in detail and where possible unit prices should be stated. Assuming that importation of materials will be necessary (and that in the case of all joinery details to windows and doors these will be made in India and sent to Bahrein ready assembled for fixing), the source of supply should be stated and an approximate cost per ton should be given for freight and/or on-carrying charges from port of embarkation to Bahrein. If any Customs dues are leviable in addition, particulars should be given as to how and at whatwhat rate these are assessed. (5) Services . If expenditure will have to he incurred on fencing, roads, lay-out of grounds, water supply, drainage electric supply, telephones or any other services not included in the building estimates, estimates should he given (6) tfhat work will he carried out hy direct labour and what hy contract? In the latter case we assume that competitive tenders will he obtained where possible. (?) What agency charges are proposed? What do they include and how are they calculated? (8) How long a period will he required after the approval for the scheme and estimate is given, for (a) the preparation and completion of the working drawings and (h) for subsequent tenders to he invited and results received. 4. I also referred to the difficult question of the incidence of cost of any excess over the approved estimate. It is our hope that it will he possible to agree the plans in such detail that it will he possible to treat them as final and so to minimise the risk of excesses through unforeseen causes. But of course we cannot eliminate the risk altogether, and must consider how to deal with the situation if it arises. 5. There will no doubt be an item for contingencies.7 — We think that this item should he reserved for minor excesses involving an increase of cost not exceeding £50, and that any excesses involving a greater increase of cost than £50 should he agreed before being put into effect, whether they are due to increases in the price of materials or labour or to changes of plan. If the Office of Works were doing the job, they would try to arrange a schedule containing unit prices for all the more important items with the successful contractor before his tender was accepted and would try to arrange an agreement with him that variations, either additions or omissions, should be assessed in accord- ance with this schedule. We should like to see something of the sort done in this case. 6. We hope that you will be able to prevail upon the Government of India that if the approved estimate is exceeded they should meet the same proportion of the excess as that which 6 lakhs bears to the approved estimate. That seems to us to be a reasonable arrangement, and may be the only one which will avoid our having to treat the expenditure for accounting purposes as direct expenditure by His Majesty’s Government, the Public Works Department becoming our agent for the purpose.m , 'V 7, Will you approach the Government of India on these lines?

We think that, before sending you an official reply, it v/ould be well to hold an interdepartmental meeting between the India Office, Treasury and Foreign Office to discuss the various questions involved. I will therefore in this letter set out oriefly the general line which we are likely to tale at such a meeting, and this will perhaps serve as a convenient basis for our discussions. 2. in the first place, we feel that the India Office v/ould be wise not to allow all these complicated ouestions of finance to hold up the arrangements which are being planned to accommodate the Resident on the Arab shore of the Gulf. As explained in our official letter of the 23rd May, we are convinced that the Persian Government will in the near future insist upon the Resident’s removal from Bushire. It may be that they will refrain from making difficulties until we have to approach them next year as regards the appointment of Fowle’s successor: but it is quite possible that they may take steps before that date. We presume therefore that you have/ R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C.Government/ * have by now considered some scheme for accommodating the Political Resident outside Persia, in case of need, before the new Bahrein Residency is built, and similarly we assume that you are anxious to push on v/ith the construction of the new buildings at Bahrein. 3. As regards the Government of India’s wish to limit their expenditure on the new Residency building to a fixed contribution of 6 lakhs, the Treasury will be prepared to state their views at our meeting. I understand that they are likely to take the line Ghat, if India’s contribution is to be a fixed sum, they must have some guarantee that the v/orks are planned and carried out with due economy. Originally, you will remember, the proposal was that the cost should be shared equally between the Government of India and the Imperial Jl Government, each of v/hom would pay 6 lakhs. But the present proposal is that the Government of India’s contribution should in no circumstances exceed 6 lakhs, while the Imperial Government’s estimated share has already risen to 11^- lakhs (viz. .oo6,0uu) and may possibly be even more than this, ill if the cost of the whole building should happen to exceed the present estimate of 17J lakhs. If the Government of India were prepared to meet a substantial proportion (not necessarily 50^) of the cost, the Treasury would be prepared to allow them a reasonably free hand, but they feel that there would be strong objection to such an arrangement if interest in the economical planning and execution of the work. The Treasury will, however, explain their own views in further detail at the meeting. the Government of India v/ere to cease to have any financial 4. As regards diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf, we have considered theGovernment/ 3 the Government of Indian offer of 9 lakhs a year, subject to revision after five years. We note their wish that their expenditure should be limited. But His Majesty’s Government too would want some limit to be placed on their expenditure, and the Treasury could obviously not be expected to agree to a system whereby the Imperial Government had to pay without question all increases in expenditure incurred at posts staffed by officers of the Indian Political Service. We should therefore have to make it a condition that the Government of India would have to obtain our consent to any increased expenditure at posts staffed from India; and v/e should similarly have to obtain the Goverment of India’s consent to any decreases in expenditure at our posts (since the Government of India would want to be safeguarded against having to go on paying a fixed sum for objects which gradually come not to be met). 5. Thus, in practice, the proposals made by the Government of India would mean the retention to some extent of the present unsatisfactory accounting arrangements by which there has to be continual consultation between the United Kingdom and India about expenditure in Persia. In fact, the new proposals would from many points of view be open to exactly the same disadvantages as the ’’Welby” arrangements of 1900. Worse still, the new arrangements would apply not only to Persia, but also to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. 6. In these circumstances, we have been considering whether it would not be possible to devise some arrangement which would be more satisfactory from our point of view, and at the same time meet theGovernment of* Indian wish to limit their expenditure, ana the simplest method of approach is to regard the entire position as a new and open one requiring consideration on the merits of existing facts, without too much regard to past history. ^• As regards Persia, there seems to us no reason why our diplomatic and consular arrangements in that country should now be different from those in other foreign countries. The special conditions existing before the war no longer apply. The reasonable solution would therefore be for the Imperial Government now to take over tne responsibility for establishing and maintaining diplomatic and consular posts in Persia, at their own expense and without any contribution from India, on the understanding that they would, of course, only establish consular posts in those towns v/here His Majesty's Government think that British consular representation is justified oy Imperial interests. If India wished to supplement our arrangements by establishing and maintaining additional appointments to serve India's special interests, we should have no objection to these appointments being made, and paid for, by India, provided that they were subordinate to and under the general superintendence of our consular officers. Thus, His Majesty's Government would pay, as in other foreign countries, for diplomatic and consular representation in Persia, wherever justified by Imperial interests, and India would pay for additional subordinate posts wherever required by India's special interests. 8. in practice, this scheme would mean that the Consular/Consular Service would have to take over Meshed Consulate—General, and consular posts at Mohammerah, and possibly Kerman. The Government of India might perhaps wish to appoint and pay for a Vice-Consul at Meshed, under the Consul-General, together v/ith subordinate Vice-Consuls at Zabul and Zahidan, also under the Consul-General at Meshed. 9. Now that the India Office are a Department of His Majesty*s Government, we feel that expenditure at posts on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf is no longer the direct concern of the Foreign Office. We are concerned, for example, with the question of the transfer of the Residency mainly from its Persian aspect; that is to say, v/e have, unfortunately, to make it perfectly clear that it will be necessary very shortly to move the Residency out of Persia, but it is not really the concern of the Foreign Office to deal with the cost of its re—establishment elsewhere. T ,e think that it would be more appropriate in present conditions for the Imperial share of this expenditure to be charged on the vote for India and Burma Services and defended before the Public Accounts Committee by the India Office. 10. it seems to us that the Government of India’s wish to limit their expenditure on diplomatic and consular establishments can be met by a reorganiscation of the Persian Consulates on the lines suggested in paragraph 7 above, (which will relieve the Government of India of nearly all their expenditure in Persia,) together with an understanding that the Government of India shall pay the expenditure incurred at the posts staffed/staffed by the Indian Political Service on the Arabian side of the Gulf. 11. I think it would be useful to hold our meeting some day next v/eek if possible, and if you agree perhaps you will kindly let me know by telephone which day you would be ready to come and discuss these problems with us and the Treasury. 12. I am sending a copy of this letter to Hale at the Treasury. Yours sincerely. (Sgd.) C.W. BaxterCopy of Hote» on Mr. Rendel’e co mment * yeao rded by Mr. R.T.

The for® of plan was adopted after very careful consideration. It is certainly more difficult to treat architecturally than if planned round a courtyard as is suggested but# it was felt that the physical comfort of the occupants should come first. From quite considerable experience of living in the courtyard type of house# both in Basra and Bagdad# I found that no through draught was to be obtained in any of the rooms except those in the side facting the breeze. More over in order to prevent the internal courtyard heating up like an oven it was usual to spread a canvass awning over the top and this further restricted the through draught. I think it may be safely said that the court yard type of plan was originally adopted for difence and purdah requirements. The main staircase may be somewhat on the small side but I think if, and when# worked out in detail it would not be undignified and can hardly be termed a 'Spiral affair'. There are examples of staircases planned in this form in various old London houses which look quite pleasing and dignified. It must be remembered when criticising details that these sketches were prepared in a very few days in order to give a general idea of the form of plan and the approximate cost. The two side staircases# which are possibly not quite so small as is imagined# are mainly intended as private approaches from the main rooms to the bedro ms on either side.

Whitehall, S .77.1. 16th March,1938. Sir, With reference to the crrrespondence resting with your letter of the 19th November,ho.E.6092/649/34, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter dated 12th November 1937,from the Government of India on the subject of the transfer of the Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrein and on the connected subject of the apportionment between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India of liability for diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and in the Persian Gulf area. Copies of a supplementary d.o.letter ^ dated 24th November 1937, and of telegrams exchanged v/ith the ^/ Government of India, are also enclosed. To Government of India ) 2. it will be seen that, in consequence dated 28.1.38. ) From Government of India ) of the necessity to build accommodation for dated 2 1.2 .58. ) the clerical and menial staff, the estimated cost of the propased Residency is now stated to be about Rs. 17-2- lakhs. The Government of India, who consider the move of the Residency to be financially unjustifiable at this figure but are ready to acquiesce in the transfer if His Majesty’s Government regard it in the light of imperial interests as an essential measure, are prepared to contribute to the cost up to the amount to which they regard themselves to be already committed, and subject to the condition referred to below. They state that the sum of Rs.6 lakhs is the utmost that they are willing to pay in any circumstances, and having regard to the reluctance with which this figure The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.1. has/■ mm (v*i) 2 . has been agreed to, and to the views held by the Government of India upon the question of any necessity for transferring the Residency from Bushire, the Secretary of State is not prepared to urge the Government of India to make any increase in their promised contribution. 3. As regards this question of the transfer of the Residency the Marquess of Zetland does not overlook that in their express letter of 6th April 1936 the Government of India were inclined to agree that, on grounds mainly of administrative convenience, the balance of advantage was in favour of the transfer, but subject always to financial considerations. The conclusion of the Middle East Committee was that for political reasons the early move of the Residency was desirable, but that the matter'should be further considered after the financial implications had been examined. Lord Zetland also appreciates the wider political considerations mentioned in para.3 of your letter of the 19th November. He suggests, however, that in so far as the transfer of the Residency to the Arab side of the Gulf might be of advantage in connection, for example, with Anglo- Saudi relations, such advantages are mainly a matter of Imperial, as distinct from specifically Indian interests. He accordingly feels that, having regard to the various reasons for which it is desired to transier the Residency and the nature of the more important interests involved, the Rs.6 lakhs offered by the Government of India towards the cost v/ould be a fair, and even a generous contribution, and he trusts that Lord Halifax and the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury will agree that it may be so regarded. The Government of India make their willingness to contribute to the cost of the new Residency to the extent of/of Rs.6 lakhs conditional upon the acceptance of proposals now put forward by them with the object of defining and stabilising their liability to bear a share of the diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and in the Persian Gulf area. In the years that have passed since this subject was last under the active consideration of His Majesty’s Government the growth of Imperial as compared with Indian interests has increased both in Persia and also^and more particularly, on the Arab coast of the Gulf. The reasons which moved the Government of India in 1922 to ask for a revision in their favour of the division of expenditure resulting from the recommendations of the •7elby Commission have become increasingly strong, and Lord Zetland agrees with the Government of India that the time has come to propose that the position should be re-examined by His Majesty’s Government. 5. The Government of India, in formulating their own proposals, proceed on the assumption that the proposal which they have already made that expenditure on the Bahrein and Muscat Agencies, at present borne entirely by India, should be shared equally between Indian and Imperial revenues will be accepted by His Majesty’s Government. Their views on this matter v/ere supported by Lord Zetland in the letter addressed to the Foreign Office on the 6th November 1936, No.P.Z.7103/36. On the assumption, therefore, that it will be agreed that tneir present liability for expenditure in Persia and the Gulf area should be limited in principle to one half of the total, the Government of India, with a view to setting a limit to their expenditure over the next five years (a point to which, as will be seen from their letter, they attach great importance), propose that their liability should be fixed at an annual lump sum contribution inrespect of cxpencii'tui'o in Persia and on tlie Arab shore of the Gulf lor tnat pei'iod, and that all expenditure whatever, whether on capital or on revenue account, in excess of that sum (with the exception, of course, of expenditure on the construction of the new Residency towards v/hich they will contribute up to Rs.6 lakhs) should be a charge on Imperial revenues. Taking the average rate of expenditure for the last three years for which accounts are available they propose that the contractual sum should be fixed for five years at Rs.9 lakhs, or £67,500 per annum, being approximately half the total expenditure. In return for their undertaking to make a contribution on this scale the Government of India would expect that no change in the present administration or ♦ administrative policy or in the location of the control over that policy and over general policy would be made. i or the reasons set forth in the Government of India’s letter, Lord Zetland would commend the proposals to Lord Halifax's favourable consideration and trusts that it will be found possible to urge their acceptance upon the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. ^ c °Py this letter and its enclosure is being sent to the Treasury. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) J. C, WALTUJ&amp;i.Conf id«nti*&gt;l. ). No.75»a, Th« Hesidency, BUS hi re* th« 27 th January 193 d, Could you please refer to Department of labour letter No.Att of the 13th January 1938 addressed to me only. I have telegraphed demi-iffictally to Hay presumiue that by ,l Agency ,l the Department of labour mean Residency* 2. I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from ?eightaan which explains itself* as you will see, ^eightman suggests that instead of the Busaitin site, which is the present one selected, the alternative one of iSaeex Point is preferable. It is true that Croad with sjy assistance and that of l*och selected Busaitin in preference to •■.asex Point, but it must be remembered that Croed'e visit took place in the cold weather and there is considerable difference, more probably in Bahrain than almost anywhere else, between the winter and somraer climates. It la of course from the hot weather point of view . . .. mr inly that the question of the site h&amp;s/to be considered. vsightman ma &lt;ea the following points (a) that the hot weather conditions at Saeex Point arc definitely cooler than those at Busaitin, and the humidity not so high} that many people from Muharraq island (on which the Busaitin site is situated) go to Hssex Point for the summer, (b) that the eub soil water at Busaitin is only a few inches from tne surface, while at Cseex Point it is said to be about five feet, (o' It is true that the chief objection to 3*sex Point is that it hae a outh aspect i.e. away from the prewailing /Sir Aubroy i.toalf., TO«. ,Oai.,MTO., «orth / iscretary to the Crovernment of India, Jxternal Affairs Department, Hew Delhi.Worth wind t but, as /sightman points out, Croad in his report of 24th October 1936 says that buildings at 'Ssssx Point might be adapted to overcome this disadvantage, (d) in Hovember last a large nhullo* laice formed not far behind the lusaitin site, and this would, wnenever it occurr« ed, increase the hut&amp;idlty at Busaitin, (e) fith regard to the discomfort of damp floors, /eight- man says: « I Imagine, from the reports on record, that Busaitin would be as damp as the Agency house whereas the 'asax Point would be far more like Jufair. The difference between Jufair and the Agency when the latter is suffering from a really dunp day has to be experienced to be believed. 4 * 6 Jufair is the site of the Naval Base, (f) the noise caused by ftoyal Air ?orce planes when the loyal Air ?orce base Is established, the site of which will be near Busaitin. 4. You will see that some at least of the above points were of a nature that should have been apparent to myself act ing in the capacity of a sort of local adviser to Troad, whom I accompanied on hla inspect ion of the various sites, and I am afraid that some of the responsibility for plumping for the Busaitin site must lie on me. At the same time, considering the sum of money involved in the oonetruction of tne \es idency^ and the fact that once constructed it will remain in perpetuo . it would be a gre&amp;ty pity to fix finally on a site about wnose suitability ar^y doubt whatever exists. 6. I suggest therefore that in view of the points raised in my paragraph 2 above, the question of siting ths Residency at Bssex Point should be reconsidered, and that Oroad might pay a /a second visit to Bahrain to re-ex&amp;iaine both sites* I presume that in any case he or some other senior ?. ? # D* Officer would have to visit Bahrain in order to fix on the exact location of the Residency and its attendant cuildin^s in whatever site is finally selected. 6. 4fith regard to the question of acquiring a site, here again is sax i’oint has certain advantages as tfeightman reports that most of it belongs to the Bahrain Government and only a comparatively small part to private owners unlike Busaitin where the reverse Is the case. This will mean that if Sesex Point is } finally decided u p on # it can be acquired certainly quicker, and possibly cheaper than Buaaitin. 7. The further consideration of the site question will not of course mean that the work which has already been done by the P, ?.J # in estimating the cost of, and drawing up the plans for, the Residency on the Busaitin site will be wasted. If the Residency is finally constructed at 2ssax Point both the cost and the building plans will be approximately the same, ftor will this consideration waste any appreciable time in getting the new Residency started since there are various preliminaries to be settled before construction can actually be begun. 8. Paragraph 2 of the Department of I* bo ur letter quoted above indicates certain steps which should now be ta&lt;en in connection with the scheme. All plans and estimates, however, have been prepared by the Central Public *orks Department and all future work will, I assume, be carried out and supervised by them: I presume that for this purpose a special officer from India will be deputed by the Central Public /orks Department to supervise the work at Bahrain. The supervision of such a largemm and ooaipXicated jor* is naturally beyond the scope of my Assistant engineer, ^rhoae time moreover is already fully taKen up with his ordinary routine duties, 9, A point *hich still remains to be decided is that of houses for trie clerical staff for whose acc omr/iodat ion provision has not been made in the estimate (see correspondence ending with my telegram 2sio,128 of the 4tn February 19o7}* 10, The question of air conditioning, or air cooling, should be considered in connection with the Residency and its attendant buildings. *11 the lahrain Fetroleum Company houses at Bahrain are either air conditioned or air cooled with good results, and there is no reason why the Resident and his staff should not be provided with a similar necessity for those who have to spend a hot weather in the climate of Bbhrain, All details can of course be obtained from the Bahrain Petroleum Company* * t am sanding a copy of tills letter to 'Nightman.

As you know, the greater part of the ITuharraq site is privately owned already, but it is perfectly simple to •« prevent sales to third parties provided I am authorised to inform His Highness the Shaikh of the site selected. I think it is most important to do this now if bnly to prevent him from thinking that he has been x^ept out of the 'secret 3, Before however we definitely inform His Highness and his Government of the site selected, I venture to urge once more that the question of the site be further considered. It is, I think, agreed that therje-aiue^nly two possible sites, namely the Muharraa site near Hus alt in and the Base* Point site. * 3o far as I can see the only objection to the latter is that it has a south instead of a north west aspect and the build ings cannot conveniently face both the sea and the prevailing breeze. Even so Croad has stated that buildings might be adapted (vide his report of the 24th October 1936). On the other hand, the Husaitin site is reported to be hotter even than Manamah, the sub soil water is only a few inches from the surface, it will be noisy when the Royal Air Eorce get going on Muharraq, and the approach through part of Muharraq town can only be described as disgusting. As you saw when you / The Hon*ble Lieutolonel Sir Trenchard Fowle,KCIE.,33E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushi re.■■pnpi k H fm - 2 - you arrived from England a huge shallow lake forms not far behind the site whenever there is a really big tide, and I should expect this to cause unbearable humi dity for two or three days on end whenever it does o^cur. But the principal objection is of course that the area is water-logged, the sub soil water being, according to a re port by the previous assistant Engineer, only six inches below the surface. T fully admit that the Exeex Pclit site does suffer from its southern aspect, but the sub soil water is said to be five feet below the ground level there, and what is equally important, it is reported that the climate is definitely cooler than Manamah and the humidity not so high. The mere fact that some of the i^harraq people go and spend the summer round about Essex Point is, I think, conclusive proof of its superiority over the Bu- saitin site* 4* Personally I think that Groad has greatly under estimated the discomfort of damp ground floors and I ima gine, from the reports on redord, that Busaitin would be as damp as the Agency house whereas the Essex Point would be far more like Jufair. 'The difference between Jufair and the agency when the latter is suffering from a really damp day has to be experienced to be believed* Yours sincerely, (sd*) H.

My dear Walton As you know, I nave been rather specially busy over Palestine during the last few weeks, so that it has been dif?icult for me to go into the question of the oreliminary plans for the new Residency at Bahrein, which you enclosed in your letter P z 7125/37 of the 10 th November, as thoroughly as I should have liked. Even now, I am afraid there is little chance of my getting time to reply adequately to your letter, and to work out really helpful constructive suggestions about the plans themselves as I should have liked to try to do. But I do not want to delay any longer sending you some kind of a reply, and so I am writing at once to give you a few comments on the plans which occur to me on a first sight of them. I realise on the other hand oh^t I hnve no 1 ocus s tandi for making any suggestions. and/ J. G. Y/alton, Esq., C.B., M.C.and that the Government of India authorities may very justifiably resent my intervention. I only, therefore, put forward these few'purely personal and tentative comments with the greatest diffidence; and I think it may be preferable, if it is thought desirable to pass them on to India at all, to do so impersonally and as not coming from me. ^ ^ . ^2. ^ 'The first question which occurs to me is whether it is really a good plan to build the new Residency in one long line, instead of building it round a courtyard. I realise that the object of this is to give the rooms the maximum amount of through draught and to enable the majority of them to face north. But I should have thought that it would still have been possible to arrange for a through draught even if the rooms were built round a courtyard, and that there would be no reason why they should not still have external as well as internal verandahs. The present scheme seems to me to be open to the drawback that the building will always be - like/ Ilike the new Agency at Koweit - mainly a fapade, while I should h^ve thought that the great number of different exits and entrances to the 'offices' as shown on the plan at present proposed would have much increased the difficulty of ensuring the secrecy and safe custody of archives* I should have thought that a building round a colonnaded courtyard would have been much more in keeping with the local architectural traditions, which seem to me well worth while following where one can* Tne next point that occurs to me is the comparative inadequacy of the main staircase. This is a point which struck me a good deal in some of the Government of India buildings which I saw in the Gulf, and which is a particular drawback to the present Political Agency in Bahrein* It must be remembered that, when important visitors or local rulers arrive, they are always met at the foot of, and generally escorted up, the staircase. The first entry into the building/r. w building up the main staircase often becomes important, rfut if the staircase is rather tucked away into a corner, and then is a rather narrow and more or less spiral affair, leading up to the bedrooms as well, as in the present plan (andCts at Koweit), it seems to me that it will be very difficult to arrange for the kind of dignified reception of distinguished visitors which is so often needed. I should have thought that it would have been much better to have had a big branching staircase quite close to the front entrance and leading straight up to the main reception rooms, and a separate staircase lor the bedrooms and offices, of a rather more important type than the small back staircases suggested at the corners of the present plan. I see further that the present plan is designed on the orthodox Indian lines, having a lot of little back staircases and verandahs behind all the bedrooms for the '’sweepers’ 1 to come in and out. If, as I hope, it is possible to arrange for seme form of internal sanitation,/sanitation, perhaps this - to ordinary European ideas - extremely awkward arrangement could be avoided. X Without.the elevation it is of course very difficult to express any opinion on the artistic merits of the new design. But I still think - as I said in my original report on my tour - that a great many local features could be incorporated easily and successfully in any design*. In this connexion, I shall be very glad, if it would be any use, to let you have some photographs which I took during my trip across •Arabia last spring, and which might perhaps prove suggestive* As I said in my letter of the 16th November, a few of these will appear in the next issue of the Geograohical Magazine, which is due to come out on the 15th December. jq 6.

H’-'P ^ r p|' My dear Walton, Many thanks for your letter P.2.7125/1937 of 10th November about the plans for the new Residency at Bahrain, and generally about official architecture in the Persian Gulf. 2. I have r^ad the enclosures witn much interest and only hope that some of my rather off-hand remarks about official architecture did not sound too offensive to some of the architects concerned. I should have tried to word them rather more cautiously had I realised that they would fall under Croad's own eye. 3. I will look at the plans for the proposed new Residency as soon as Palestine leaves me a few spare moments, and I am most grateful to you for sending them, though it may be a little difficult to express a final opinion on them without seeing the elevations. I am delighted at any rate to see that the proposal to transfer the Residency has taken so much material shape. | Reob.1&gt;ol. dJ . Meanwhile/ 17NOVJ93Z •’.C. Walton, Bsq. , C.B. , M.C.,4. Meanwhile, there are one or two points in the enclosures in your letter which I can answer at once. I am afraid that in alluding to 'graceful native plaster work' I was chiefly thinking of buildings that Groad could nevur have seen, e.g. the palaces at Hasa and Riyadh where the plaster work is really lovely. There is of course some very pretty plaster work in Bahrain itself, and Belgrave must be iamiliar with it, as he was, I understood, iesponsible lor tne restoration of several little mosques in the sauie style, notably near the Sheikh of Bahraini summer palace. Neither the Sheikh’s palaces in Bahrain, nor the palaces I am thinking of in Hasa and at Badia near Riyadh, are designed primarily as fortresses. They actually have wider verandahs and more possibilities of light and air than the ordinary Government of India official buildings in the Gulf. But far more use is made of the colonaded court - at any rate in Saudi Arabia - and the general lines 01 the buildings seem to me far more graceful and successful than those of ours. Even the Sheikh’s palaceat Kuwait struck me as a great improvement on our own agency there. 5. As regards the use of salt water, I confess tnat I was thinking of wnat we used to have on old fashioned ships. I did not mean at all that the use of fresh water should he suppressed, hut that it should, wherever possible, he supplemented. I should have thought that the sanitation difficulties could have been overcome, hut this of course is a technical subject on which I am not qualified to speak. 6. You will, by the way, see a few photographs of some of the daudi buildings in an article which my wife is publishing about our trip across Arabia in the January number of the Geographical Magazine. But I can easily let you see some more, and make further suggestions, when the time comes to go into the question of the new Bahrain residency in greater detail. 7. With renewed thanks for your letter, to which this is of course only a brief preliminary reply. Yours ever,T need not e«y tnat tne idea of perwinently batning in sea-water is abhorrent.

Dated Camp,Simla, the 13th August 1937 # dear Hay, Many thanks for your letter enclosing extracts from the report of an officer of the Foreign Office regarding Government of India buildings in the Persian Gulf. The letter is instructive in that it gives another point of view a: X -ss X X . I also sav/ the building put up by the Bahrein Petroleum Co. They 7/ere generally very much on the small side and have not got the deep verandahs, which the report implies except on one side. Economy has been effected in room space by having a central cooling apparatus connected up to each residence with a radiator in each room. Cold brine is circulated throughout the system and apparently forms a miniature ice berg on the radiator. I should think this system is dangerous, as it must be difficult to adjust the cooling and humidity and these must bear some distinct relation to one another and to the conditions outside to render living in the rooms comfortable and safe. It would be interesting to know if there were many cases of pneumonia or other pulmonary diseases at the oil fields during this hot weather. It must be remembered that these buildings have been run up to accommodate a staff, who are only required for a short period of possibly 5 years during the drilling of the wells, so the obvious thing is to have them small the and -^^only way to make a small house liveable in is to adopt some artificial means of refrigeration. As an instance of the lavish way the Petroleum Go. spend money, the carpenters employed on the wood work of the buildings were Americans imported by air for the latter part of the Journey from Europe. I admit the buildings look nice rather after the style of the small seaside bungalows one sees dotted all overover the South Coast of England, and I think for the temporary purpose for which they have been put up they are ideal. They cannot, however, be taken as a standard to which we should attain. The report rather contradicts itself, because in paragraph 56 it condemns the Government of India buildings in the Gulf, and -then in paragraph 57 praises the local architecture such as 'large central courtyards' which the Government of India buildings previously followed; I personally saw no graceful native plaster and as for straight lines the horizon is the straightest line in the Gulf. The main object of architecture is to combine a pleasing design with comfort and convenience of layout. Arab buildings are constructed primarily for defence and isolation and everything else is sacrificedjto it. Hence only one exipt and the requisite courtyard which has been so much admired. In order to obtain the maximum of comfort, every living room should face the prevailing breeze, thus ensuring a through draught. Therefore it is essential that the building should be spread out across the breeze. Regarding Koweit, this was designed in the rough by Russell, but the detail necessarily had to be left to the man on the spot - an Assistant Sr^ineer under the direct orders of the Political Resident. This is an unsatisfactory way and gives the Architect no opportunity to control things, and Russell very wisely made things as simple as possible. The report is wrong about the yellow brick, which being porous and underbumt does not retain heat to the same extent as stone. Actually this building struck me as K being on the cool side when I visited it in April 1935. ModernModern sanitation is not general in India, so it is not surprising that it has not been a dopted in the Gulf* It is quite possible there, but sea water for flushing is not the easy matter assumed unless raw sewage is to be dis charged directly into the sea to contaminate the surrounds to the buildings* Sea water again sounds very nice to one, who does not have to use it continuously for baths, and the Royal davy would not go to the pains they do to give their crews fresh water for baths if there were not objections to it. For other reasons, the sea water at Bahrein could not be used, because the jetties in close proximity to the Residence are used as latrines. I am glad that you have given us this opportunity of seeing the criticisms, and I trust I have answered them to some extent and that I have convinced you that things are not so bad as they are painted. a X X Yours sincerely. 3d* A.

Russell has not done any elevations yet, because until things are sanctioned, this is rather a waste oi time, but the buildings with all storeys should be qdite imposing. Yours sincerely, Sd. A.
