Kemball states that he departed on 14 April, attended by the suite of Naval Officers and Artificers. Kemball encloses the following:A letter, signed by S Galloway, John Shepherd and Robert Campbell at East India House, London, dated 28 July 1849, which transmits a copy of a letter, dated 26 July 1849, from Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the President of the Indian Board. This second letter concerns the separation of the town and district of Bussorah from the Pashalie of Baghdad. This includes Sir Stratford Canning's opinion that this arrangement is an indication of some scheme for the extension of Turkish sway along the south western shore of the Persian Gulf. In the original letter Kemball states his own doubts as to whether Maashook Pasha's projects will be realised.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023651902.0x000007#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
