Report on the Proceedings of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission from July 16 until its termination on October 26, by Captain A. T. Wilson, C.M.G., Political Department, Government of India. THIS report has been designed to give a general survey of the proceedings of the Commission from the 16th July till the conclusion of its labours pn the 26th October. It is supplementary to, and should be read in conjunction with— [a.) The proces-verbaux of the Commission, in which the frontier is described in detail. These have been printed, indexed, and bound. (b.) Various official reports dealing with particular districts, referred to in the bibliography (Appendix VII) including official route books, but excluding the £ ‘°Gazetteer of Persia” which is too unreliable in substance and incon venient in form to be of practical utility. Full route reports covering the w'hole region traversed have been submitted from time to time to the Government of India, for transmission to the Chief of the General Staff, India. . (c.) Special political and military reports from Kurdistan and Azarbaijan, upon the frontier districts from Fao'to latitude 36°, which are under preparation by Captain Wilson and which will probably be printed confidentially by the Government of India. (d.) The Identic, Keduced Identic Maps, and the Supplementary, Additional, and other maps, a list of which is given in Appendix VIII. It does not deal at all with the history of the frontier question in the region dealt with, e.g., the Kotour question, for details of which reference should be made_ to the full precis and memoranda available in Foreign Office Print, the principal of which are mentioned in the attached bibliography. * April 15-Juue 1, July 16-0ctober g [2286 z — 4] M * ' • \ Bq The appendices include the following generalnotes covering the whole work of the Commission from Fao to Ararat : Appendix I. A report by Lieutenant-Colonel Eyder on the work accomplished by the different survey parties. . . , Appendix II. A list of the personnel of the British Commission. ^ Appendix III. A note on transport arrangements. , Appendix IV. A complete itinerary, with dates, mileage, pillars erected, and notes regarding; temperature and weather experienced. ^ . . . , Appendix V.

Copies are also attached of the Royal warrants appointing the British and Deputy British Commissioners. The spelling adopted in the body of the report is that yf the V roces-verbaux and the supplementary maps: it follows no known system, and is from every point of view defective, but the adoption of any other system at this stage would be liable to cause confusion. Vezneh and the Kandil Dagh, July 20-24.-The frontier line having crossed the Vezneh River, east of Chenieh, reaches the peak of Tchaurm, where the \ ezneh district may be said to begin, and follows the crest of the hills to the west of tne plain up to the summits of the Kandil Dagh. The narrow Vezneh valley is fertile and grassy, but the hills in the vicinity are treeless; it is occupied all the summer by Bilbas tribesmen, mostly Persian subjects, and by a few who considered themselves, at the moment we visited them, to be Turks. The frontier is lofty, a succession of peaks separated by difficult passes, the drop on the Turkish side being very steep indeed, so much so that for practical purposes the Vezneh plain cannot be approached from the south-west, only from the west by two difficult tracks, and from the south by the Zmwi Sebnan pass, which is easy but high, the usual route being some 4 miles to the east of it again. I he frontier at this point and for some distance northwards runs along the extreme western edge of the identic map, and M. Minorsky suggested that the supplementary maps under preparation should cover a certain area on either side, more particularly on the Turkish side, the Persian side having already been mapped. The proposal was reason able enough in itself, but was tactlessly represented to Aziz Bey, who, in consequence, showed some reluctance to agree, though had it been our surveyors who were to operate on the Turkish side no question would have arisen. Finally, at a meeting of the “ Corps technique,” to whom the question of the area on either side to be mapped was referred, a maximum zone was defined about 10 miles wide on either side, and this was accepted by all parties. „ South of latitude 36° the maps made by the British party covered the country tor 15 miles or more on either side of the frontier. The Russian surveyors, howmver, had no ambition to do more than they were obliged and the zone, instead of being 10 miles wide was narrowed down to a total of 5 or 6. The Persian survey party, which was anxious to prove its mettle, was detailed to survey the western slopes ol the Kandi , and found it by no means easy. Though it was mid-July snow stUl lay at 7,000 feet, and mist and rain interfered with the work ; the range was so precipitous that movement was very arduous, and to add to the difficulties the Russian map, of which they took a trace before leaving, was found to be quite inaccurate, the watershed being placed thereon several miles to the east. Before they returned, however, the Russian surveyor had discovered and rectified his mistake, thus depriving the Persians of a much-desired chance of demonstrating the unreliablity of Russian survey work. The Kandil Dagh is one of the finest mountains on this frontier ; the snow lies heavily all the year round, and a remarkable number of fine streams rise in its deep valleys. Two or three difficult tracks traverse it, only one at the head of the Badinawa valley being passable for lightly laden mules. A strip of beautifully wooded, well-watered, and fertile country intervenes between the Vezneh district and that of Lahidjan, which is occupied by other andsedentary branches of the Bilbas. The main track descends to the level of the Kialou stream, crossing the tributaries referred to above, and then gradually ascends to the Lahidjan plain, which it enters at Tarkash. Lahidjan, July 25-26.—The Lahidjan plain is treeless, but fertile, and bounded east and west by high ranges; to the north a low range separates it from the Ouchnou aUshnu)^ and Solduz districts, and from the watershed between the Little Zab and the ^Juroumia (Urumieh) Lake—between the systems of north-west Persia and the Persian Gulf. The inhabitants are turbulent, and previous to the Russian occupation frequently raided Christian and other villages in Solduz, and even further north. The frontier continues to follow the watershed, and gave rise to no discussion except on the Giru Chinke pass between Khaneh (Lahidjan) and Rayat (Turkey), where springs just on the Turkish side of the watershed were found to be owned by a Persian tribal chief who conducted the waters by means of a small channel to lands on the Persian side of the watershed: his rights in the spring were recognised by the Mediatory Commissioners in an arbitral decision. This pass is one of the easiest between Qasr-i-Shirin and Ararat, and is, for some distance on either side, quite fit for carts; in fact, with a little labour carts and artillery could be taken to-day all the way from Russia to Rayat via Ouroumia, Ouchnou, and Lahidjan. The inhabitants of Vezneh and Lahidjan, like other Kurds with whom the Commission came into contact, were uniformly friendly to the British Commission ; they were near enough to the zone of Russian influence, and knew enough of the Russian consul at Sauj Bulaq not to treat the Russian Commission with open contumely or insult, as was done in Kurdistan, but they showed markedly their suspicion at the interest taken by Russians in this part of the world, and not long after, when the Commission had left, they pulled down the pillars erected by the Russian triangulation party in the neighbourhood, thus contributing to the untimely breakdown of Colonel Krimlikoff’s grandiose plans, to which reference is made in Colonel Ryder’s report. The Head Waters of the Lavene, July 27—31.—North-west oi Lahidjan the frontier curves sharply westward so as to include in Persia the head waters of the Lavene, the source of the Kialou (Lesser Zab) ; to the valleys in which it rises Kurdish tribes in considerable number emigrate from Turkey each spring, and their right to do so was specifically recognised in the protocol. Several passes, none of them difficult, lead across the range here, the principal being (from south to north) Barzine, Merikine, Zerdeguel, the last named being at the very head waters of the Lavene. The Commission found Turkish tribes there in considerable numbers ; their relations with the Bilbas appeared to be satisfactory. Passavo, July 27.—-From Lahidjan the British Commission went direct to Passova (Paswahj, Colonel Ryder continuing along the frontier towards Ouchnou. Passova, which during the Turkish occupation of 1912 was occupied by Ottoman troops (who suffered severely from typhus) is a large village, with an indifferent water supply. Great mounds in the vicinity indicate that to ancient, as to modern, Persians Lahidjan was an attractive locality, supporting in all probability a larger population than at present. Forests. —It is very noticeable that the woods, which are such a noticeable and pleasing feature of Kurdistan, cease abruptly south of Lahidjan, and never reappear; it is difficult to ascribe this sudden change either to climatic conditions or to denudation at the hands of the population : it may be a combination of both causes. Ouchnou and the Head Waters of the Gadere, July 28.—The first pass, and the first pillar to be erected on the watershed between Turkey and the basin of the Ouroumia Lake was that of Keleshin. The watershed is here marked by an ancient cuneiform inscription, which is stated to record the frontier between the Limitrophe States in Sassanian times; though it was just west of the watershed it was accepted, £C par esprit de conciliation,” as a boundary pillar (No. 123), and two others erected close by. This pass is of some importance, being the main route from Ouchnou to Sidaka and elsewhere in Turkey ; it is also used by Turkish nomads who camp here in large numbers ; the right of these tribes to camp near Keleshin is scarcely covered by the terms of the protocol, which refers to the headwaters of the Gadere south of Dalampere, viz., 30 miles north of Keleshin. Their exclusive right to these summer quarters appeared, however, to be fully recognised locally. Several days were spent at Ouchnou where the British Commission was hospitably entertained by the officers of a detachment of Russian troops quartered here.4 These troops were sent ostensibly to safeguard the Boundary Commission a month nr Twvimis to our arrival and have since been withdrawn. 0 n . OT predominant chiefs in Ouchnou are Kurds of the Zarza clan ^ whom ^ --n Khan is the most important; they are spiritless tune-servers, on them own sh g, have welcomed in turn the Turks and the Russians and are ready to welcome the “'''T^to'™^ 1 prosperous and the presence of Russian troops, though resentef in some quarters, has no doubt increased the feeling of security. we st of A pillar was erected on the Kherena Pass (No. 125) some 12 “ lle « due w est “ Ouchnou but the rest of the watershed, though as carefully mapped as the Russian surveyors were capable of, was not pillared, practicable routes being reported to be non-existent between Kherena and the Margawar district. reached Margawar, August 5-7—It was at Margawar that news of the war first reached the Commission, on the 4th August. The Persians and Turks made uo secret of their elation at Russia being involved in war in Europe and were correspon g y P ^ when a dav or two later, it was announced that Great Britain had also &lt; • it was very generally agreed that this made ultimate German success impossible^ and this was the view universally held in Ouroumia among the Nestorian and Christian communities, who number many men who have been to Europe and America. The mappimr of the Dalampere range south-west of Margawar took some ,me “ presented some difficulty, the valley of the Gadere extending further westwards than was shown on the Identic map. the watershed, moreover, was not easy of acces. y two passes cross it in the south-west corner of Margawar one of them west of Bmar (ruined village) was found to be so little used as to be not worth marking; the other, . Zinwi Sour (Dola Khani), the principal pass, was duly marked by a pillar (No. 127 )■ This is an easy pass starting from Guirtyk in Margawar, crossing e tange descending to Halane 4 miles and Katouna 8 miles (Kalana and Katunan of Maunsell s map North of uillar 127 the frontier again makes a wide curve westwards m the neighbourhood of Djerma and Bitkar; the watershed here is very well marked, and is recognised on both sides to be the frontier; the tracks across it are difficult and little used, and the sub-commission charged with erecting pillars along this strip considered that there was no necessity to mark any pass except Zinwi iaboutan (128) which connects Dierma and Bitkar with Katouna. „ , W1 ^ . • o Ouroumia. —From the 5th to 15th August the main body of all the Commissions halted at Ouroumia ; it had originally been intended to stay only four days whilst a sub-commission worked along the frontier to Targavar. But once among the fleshpots or rather the fruit trees, of Ouroumia, the foreign commissions showed no keenness to return to the frontier, and it was not until the 17th that the Commission met again at Hakki, west of Mawana, in Targavar, to resume delimitation northwards from Mt. Sitawour, to which point the sub-commission had brought the trontier. The time in camp at Ouroumia was not wholly wasted ; a general refitting took place, the boots and clothes supplied to all ranks at Mohammerah being mostly worn out • the spare kit and stores which had been sent on from Pendjwin were overhauled, partly taken into use and partly repacked and left at Ouroumia in store with the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission, the members of which were most helpful to the British Commission during its stay. Some Persian-speaking servants were dismissed and Turkish-speaking servants taken on ; the number of mules with the Commission was further reduced. The survey party also made use of this time to prepare furt er P The large Bussian garrison were extremely hospitable, and the Russian authorities in the town were helpful and obliging. The military officers and escort of the Commission assisted in a parade of the Russian garrison to pray for the success of tne Allies and to offer thanks for past victories ; the General Officer Commanding took the opportunity to call for three cheers for the King Emperor and his army, whicn the Russian troops present rendered by the long drawn out resonant shouts peculiar to them. An attempt by the band to play the British National Anthem was unsuccessful. The political situation was the object of special study, and a quantity of information collected on the subject on the spot was submitted to His Majesty s lehran m despatch form from time to time. . . ^ ^ • i- Tarqawar, August 15-21.—The description m the protocol of the frontier line, from Sitawour to Kotoul Dagh, i.e., west of Targawar and Baradost was unnecessarily vague, in view of the fact that M. Minorsky had already visited the locality and was well aware of the fact, for instance, that no mountain of the name “ Mt. Zont wasknown locally. At the first seance held it was agreed to recognise as “ Mt. Zont ” the hill known as Khizan, and occupying approximately the same position on the ground relatively to Hakki as “ Mt. Zont ” on the map; the crest between the Kalankani watershed and the summit of Khizan proved somewhat complicated, the watershed lying below the crest of the hill, and being separated therefrom by a low basin. Ic was not demarcated without a good deal of discussion, which was rendered » e more lively by the fact that a skirmish between Russian and Turkish troops, with several casualties on either side, had taken place early in the year, and the rival frontiers were still dotted with sangars and strewn with cartridge cases, whilst the presence at Hakki of a strong Russian post made the Turks less inclined to yield to the inevitable, and, by admitting the watershed to be the frontier, to give the crest of the hill to Persia. “ Mt. Zont” and the frontier south of the Marbichu-Arzine River having thus been settled, the parties interested were next induced to agree upon a peak north of the river, as being the eastern end of the Seri-Bay dost ” chain ; but all attempts to bring them to an agreement on the manner in which the frontier line was to run between these two peaks failed, and recourse was had to arbitration, with results that can he seen by reference to the protocols and map. No strategical or local issues were involved, and it was simply a case of choosing a line which, without being unreasonably artificial, would be a fair compromise between the claims of the two parties. Baradost, August 22-26.—From Ser-i-Baydost to Kotoul Dagh the protocol line again leaves the watershed, and is in addition very vaguely described. This time, however, recourse w r as not had to arbitration, the parties agreeing to a line for which the most that could be said was that it was not contrary to the protocol, and that they had agreed to it. A great number of pillars wmre erected (to be pulled down a few weeks later by the Turks), Sero and Sartyk, villages of Baradost which were secured by the protocol to Persia, were duly evacuated by the Turks (to be reoccupied a month or so later). The Persians agreed, somewhat unexpectedly, to leave Khanyk to Turkey, for there is nothing in the protocol to show that this was intended, and such information on the subject as eould be found in the pages of Darvish Pasha, Tchirikoff, Mirza Jafar Khan, and Khurshid Effendi rather tended in the opposite direction. However, it was oocupied by Turkish troops when we passed, and neither the British nor Russian representatives thought it necessary to stiffen the back of the Persians, as this would have made agreement between the parties impossible. Bajirgah, on the Turkish side, was rather more strongly garrisoned than usual with some fifty zaptiehs ; the fact that the garrison had been strengthened was known from hearsay to the Russians at Ouroumia, and when from the peaks near Sair their look-out men saw the tents of the Commission near Sero, it was assumed to be the camp of a Turkish army, and M. Minorsky had some difficulty in making the Russian authorities in Ouroumia credit his assurances that the Turks had not crossed the frontier. The last meeting held in Baradost was at Berduk, at the foot of the hills, close to the ruins of a fine old mosque, built of alternate layers of white and black stone and now used as a barn. The frontier from Kotoul Dagh to Pir Omar Dagh, on the south boundary of Katour, follows the watershed, which here again curves sharply westward, and was agreed upon without discussion at this meeting. Somai, 29th-31st August.—-This portion of the frontier, which forms the boundary between the Persian district of Somai and the Turkish qaza of Bashkaleh, is not easily accessible from the Persian side, and it was therefore decided that the Sub-Commission charo-ed with the erection of pillars should cross to the Turkish side. As the mobilisation of troops at Bashkaleh had been accompanied by a general requisitioning of all foodstuffs in the principal villages, and it was thought desirable to restrict as far as possible the size of our caravans, Captain Wilson therefore, with a small caravan went with the Sub-Commission, the mam caravan, under Colonel Ryder, goino- an to Khanyga, en route for Kotour by easy stages through the Dilman district *A number of pillars were erected along the watershed, which was found to be represented with fair accuracy on the Identic Map, and Khanyga was reached on the 2nd September. Attack by Kurds on Shooting Party of British Commission, and Wounding of Mr. Hubbard. The main body of the British Commission, under Colonel Ryder, on its way to Khanyga, reached Ashnok, some ten miles from the frontier, on the Persian side at midday on the 31st August. During the afternoon, in accordance with their usual [2286 0—4] C6 custom, five officers went out partridge shooting m a ravine close to camp, which had been indicated to them by local villagers, who had shown themselves most friendly, as likely to afford good sport. When less than 2 miles from camp, the party was suddenly attacked at close range by some fifteen (not ten, as first reported) Kurds from a neighbouring encampment. About thirty aimed shots were fired, at ranges of from 50 to 400 yards, in broad daylight, the time being about 5'30 p.m. Mr. Hubbard, who hjv4 just left one party to rejoin the other (they had separated where the ravine forked,, was struck by a bullet fired at 400 yards, and just missed by another. He was himself unarmed. * . . The bullet, passing between and damaging two fingers of the right liana, pierced the right thigh, severing the sciatic nerve. The two parties retreated hastily, leaving Mr. Hubbard lying helpless on the ground between them, each party naturally thinking that he was with the other. On reaching camp it was noticed that he had not arrived, and a party of officers, sowars, and others at once set off to find him, which they soon succeeded in doing, and he was brought into camp with some difficulty. From the remarks let drop by the Kurds who came up and searched him for money and from other evidence, it seems fairly clear that the attack on the party w^as premeditated and that it was made under the impression that our officers were Russians, with the object of embroiling the chief of the Somai district, Ismail Agha (Simko), of the Abdui clan, with the former, his friends and patrons. Ten men were arrested through Ismail Agha, some of them being Muhammadi Shikak tribesmen, recently arrived from the Turkish side, where they had been in receipt of subsidies from Jevdet Bey, kaimakam of Bashkaleh, and some of them villagers from the hamlet of Qizil Kend close by. Two of them, in examination before Captain Wilson, admitted having fired at Mr. Hubbard, but all the rest denied having any knowledge of the incident, though, in several cases, they were stated in the evidence of a fellow prisoner to have been present. Ismail Agha, however, alleged that he had good grounds for the arrest of all the remainder, and as he was the responsible local authority, and as, in any case, the men arrested would serve as hostages for the production of the guilty parties, the ten prisoners were despatched to Khoi via Dilman and subsequently to Tabriz, for custody by the Governor-General and for disposal in communication with His Majesty’s consul, Tabriz. Mr. Hubbard, who from the date of bis injury until some time after he left Batoum was in almost continuous severe pain, which he endured with exemplary patience and fortitude, could not be moved till the 8th September, when he was transported by short stages to Dilman and thence by Russian ambulance waggon (a most clumsy vehicle) to Khoi, where he arrived on the 13th September. On the :20th he left for Julfa by Russian motor ambulance, accompanied by Captain H. W. Pierpoint, I.M.S., and Captain F. L. Dyer, LA. Batoum was reached a few days later, and on the 1st October the party, who had meanwhile been joined by Major Cowie and Captain Brooke, left for Constantinople, notwithstanding the closing of the Dardanelles. In reporting the affair to His Majesty’s Foreign Office Captain Wilson expressed the view that “ the action of all officers concerned, from first to last, was unexcep tionable, and that the incident could not be attributed to any lack of foresight or prudence on the part of any of them.” Mr. Hubbard had, from the beginning, taken a prominent part in organising the secretariat, preparing the proces-verbaux, reports, &amp;c. and furnishing every Commission with two or more typed copies. Thanks largely to his energy, the foreign commis sioners never had the opportunity of postponing a seance on the plea that documents, Ac., were not ready, and the written proceedings of the Commission were marked by an orderliness and accuracy whollv foreign to the natures of the majority of the commis sioners and their staffs, whose habits of thought and speech were generally so diffuse, and their methods so unbusinesslike, that it was a matter of no small difficulty to produce an intelligible proces-verbal and to obtain the necessary signatures to the various documents to be attached thereto. The Persian and Turkish secretaries shared to the full the defects of their chiefs and were of little, if any, assistance. Return to India of the Escort and Part of the Survey Party. From the 4th September, when the main party went on to Khanyga under Colonel Ryder, till the 6th October, the latter replaced the British Commissioner on the frontier, Mr. Hubbard’s condition making it necessary for Captain Wilson to remainoq+u til l ( ^ &gt; e P a ^ ur e from Khoi^ for Batoum on the 20th September. On the , ep em er Major Cowie and Captain Brooke reached Khoi with the escort, survey partv and aii available servants, mess gear, stores, &amp;c. On the 24th these officers left or a oum en route for India, in accordance with instructions received. On the 26th a caravan was despatched to Tabriz with surplus tents, equipment, stores, &amp;c. for sale, fj. 11 . e , a .? 0 ^^er caravan was sent to Mohammera vi^, Ispahan with equipment oestmed tor Indio, and on the 28th the escort and the bulk of the survey party left for Karmanshah for India vi&amp; Baghdad. Kotour,' September 6th-l7th.—The final solution of the Turco-Persian frontier question having been, for the fourth time in its long history,* impeded by the outbreak ot war m Europe, it was but fitting and in accordance with historical precedent that the demarcation of the Kotour district should become a bone of contention. At tne first meeting held in Kotour the frontier was discussed without any indica tion being given by the^ Turkish Commissioners that his Government contemplated raising objections, and it is not unlikely that he was unaware of such an intention. If no decision was arrived at this sitting it was primarily because the Bussian map of Kotour, to prepare which Russian surveyors had been sent ahead ten days before, was found to be so inaccurate as to be useless for purposes of demarcation : the Identic Map upon a part of which the line laid down in the 1880 protocol of Sary Kamiche was shown was also found to be of very little use for practical purposes ; these diffi culties were increased by the fact that M. Minorsky,'}' who was solely responsible for drafting this portion of the protocol, had here, as often elsewhere, committed the error of describing the frontier in two different ways, i.e., stating— (!•) That the protocol of 15th/28th July, 1880, of Sary Kamiche should be applied, and then adding, quite superfluously; (2.) That certain villages should thus fall to Turkey, and others to Persia. Since 1880 a new hamlet (Dawdawa) had sprung up on the Persian side of the 1880 line, amongst the villages which were to be given to Persia, and one village, Haratil, had apparantly changed its position, and was found to be west instead of south of Razi. On the following day the Turkish Commissioner handed to his colleagues a laconic note stating that he had received instructions from his Government to cease delimita tion. In the absence of any official information on the subject, it is to be presumed that the explanation of this step given by the Turkish Secretary at the time was correct, viz., that the inhabitants (Chemseki tribesmen) of the six villages destined to be transferred to Persia, alarmed at the prospect of being handed over to the tender mercies of the local Persian chiefs, of the rival Abdui clan, their hereditary foes, had been protesting by telegram to Van and Constantinople. Emphasis was added to their representations by the fact that in the course of the general mobilisation the villagers in question had furnished a number of men for the army, and these men were actually under training in the disputed villages, which were all occupied by detachments of Turkish troops. Left to themselves, the Turkish and Persian Commissioners, who, with their staffs, had seen quite enough of the frontier, would have abandoned work forthwith. The Mediating; Commissioners, however, referred the matter to their Ambassadors at Constantinople, and, pending a reply, did what was possible to delay the break up of the Commission. Lieutenant Colonel Ryder, meanwhile, in his double capacity as doyen of the Corps technique and acting British Secretary, secured the completion of the description of the frontier up to date, and of the supplementary maps relating thereto. On the 17th September the Turkish Commissioner announced that he had received orders to continue the demarcation provided that Kotour was left alone. The same evening the Prussian commissioner was informed by his Embassy that the Grand Vizier had agreed that the work of demarcation should continue, provided that the evacuation by Turkish troops of the disputed villages was postponed till after demobilisation—a very different solution to that stipulated for by Aziz Bey. M. Minorsky, however, was most anxious to continue the work, on any conditions, and accepted Aziz Bey’s proposition.

This development was not entirely unexpected, although the Grand Vizier appears to have twice assured the Russian Ambassador that orders had been given for the completion of the delimitation. _ _ . . , . An identic telegram was at once sent by the mediating commissioners o eir Ambassadors asking for instructions, adding that all the necessary maps had een finished, and that climatic conditions were favourable for a continuance o± the wor . A few days later the Turkish commissioner announced that orders had been given orColonel Fuad Zia Bey to replace him on the Commission, the Turkish deputy commis sioner, A-bdul Hamid Bey, having in the meantime full powers. A meeting, twice postponed by the Turks, was at last held on the 18th October, and, further, a section of frontier settled. The Turks, however, on the excuse that mobilisation was in progress, refused to evacuate Djowzer (a small hamlet on the Persian aMie of the frontier, where half a dozen zaptiehs were posted), and added that they ^uld likewise be unable to evacuate Boulak Bachi. A few days later a further section, up to Boulak Bachi, was agreed upon, the Turkish deputy commissioner refusing to do more, on the ground that Colonel Fuad Zia Bey had instructed him to await his arrival. Fuad Bey, however, did not materialise, and on the 23rd October the remainder of the frontier, up to pillar 37 of the Turco-B,ussian frontier, was agreed on. It is worth noting that the present frontier line, whereby Boulak Bachi is left to Persia, is unnatural and artificial ; the simplest line, and one which wouJd well accord with the present status quo would enter the marshes south of Guir Beran follow the present boundary line to pillar 230, and then follow the medium jilum aquce of the marshes to the north-western extremity, whence a straight line would be drawn to meet the present frontier. Turkish subjects have always enjoyed the right to cut reeds on the marsh, and this right was guaranteed to them by the Commission. About miles west of Boulak Bachi stands a small ruined building, known as the Kurkh, which is said to have been on the ancient frontier between Turkey and Persia. A pillar was erected at the foot of the lava, approximately on latitude 39 26 , longitude 49° 22', as laid down in the protocol, and from this point it was agreed that the boundary should run due north through the lava to a prominent peak (Kami Yarykh Dagh), and thence through a series of peaks along the watershed to a point a few hundred yards south-west of pillar 37, which is then reached by a straight line. No pillars were erected, none being necessary, the lava being impassable and the peaks and watershed well marked; the whole area, moreover, is very sparsely inhabited. A final seance was held on the 26th October at Bazyrgah, at which M. Minorsky announced that he had just received a telegram from his Ambassador to the efiect that the Grand Vizier had consented to have the frontier of Kotour marked on the map, and had promised to issue the necessary orders to the Turkish representative on the Commission. The latter had, however, received no such orders; it was, therefore, decided to consider this as the final sitting of the Commission, and to hold a supple mentary sitting in two days’ time, at which the question of Kotour could be discussed, if the Turkish deputy commissioner had in the meantime received his orders. On the 28th October, however, the Turkish deputy commissioner declared that he was still without orders, adding that he had not even received a reply to his telegiam requesting permission to return via liflis (whither Fuad Zia Bey and Basri Bey had gone). M. Minorsky was very insistent that a further halt should be made at Bazyrgan, but the British commissioner announced his intention of leaving forthwith ; he agreed, however, as also did his Persian and Turkish colleagues, that it a further seance was held at Tiflis, to discuss the Kotour question, he should be represented by M. Minorsky. Captain Wilson left Bazyrgan on the evening of the 28th, and reached Shah Takhteh, on the night of the 29th ; news of the outbreak of war between Turkey and the Allies was received there on the 30th October, and both officers, who had intended to return via Constantinople, left at once via Tiflis and Baku for Petrograd en route for London. General Remarks. (N.B.—Orthography according to official system). I .—Turkish Frontier Organisation. Shatt-al-Arab. —Gendarmerie posts are posted at intervals between Fao and Basrah on the Turkish bank, those nearest Mohammerah being at Umm-ul-Gharb, 1 mile below the mouth of the Kharun, on the island of Shamshamiyah, 2 miles above Failiyeh, and at Di’aiji, 2 miles west of the Turco-Persian frontier. The total number of men distributed amongst the various posts is probably not over 100. Arabistan. From Di’aiji to the Dawairij there are no Turkish posts near the frontier, the nearest being a gendarmerie post on the Shatt-al-Arab at Kataiban. [2286 ^—4] D10 Pusht-i-Kuh.—From the Dawairij River to the Tib River there are for practical purposes no frontier guards; the centre of the district (the official name of which is Dawairij) is Halfiyah, a large Arab village some 15 miles east of Amara, where the Turkish mudir lives, with a force of some thirty or forty gendarmes, subordinate to Amara. From the Tib to the Changulak stream (Baksai) the nearest Turkish posts are on the Tigris, at Ali Gharbi and Ali Sharqi. There was in 1914 no gendarmerie polf? at Baksai° Both Arabs and Lurs wander freely on both sides of the frontier, and no attempt is made to check them. From Baksai onwards Turkish posts become more frequent, and some sort of organi sation is apparent, permanent posts existing at— 1. Badrah : a mudir and some fifty gendarmes. 2. Tepe Tursak : an officer and twenty gendarmes. 3. Mendeli : a kaimakam and fifty gendarmes. The Khanikin district seems to be the first met with coming from the south where frontier guards are a regular force with specific duties. All the forts between Kan-i-Biz and the Sirwan (fifteen in all) were garrisoned by a few men each, probably 100 in all, under one officer. These are voluntarily enlisted locally. After the transference to Turkey of the Chia Surkh district thirty gendarmes under an officer were sent to Chia Surkh. As far as could be ascertained there are no other frontier posts under Khanikin. Sulaimania District (mutessariflik).—This district, which is subordinate to the Mosul vilayet, is divided into two kaimakamliks—Halabja Shahr-i-Zur) and Panjwin. Turkish authority was well established at Halabja, where there were some thirty gendarmes and smaller posts found at— Gulanbar (Khourmal). Tavvileh (under Gulanbar). Biareh (under Gulanbar). Khan Garmileh (since vacated). Gulanbar is still the chief place of the district; there is a telegraph office at Gulanbar and also at Halabja. From here onwards frontier guards were a good class of man, well organised and well clothed. At Panjwin were some thirty men under an officer, a mudir ; the mudir of Qizilja was also living here ; there were military posts at Piran, Qaleh Khar, and Khaluzah (villages since transferred to Persia). North of Panjwin the frontier takes a sharp bend eastwards to include the valley of the Shirwan, which constitutes the district of Shalair, or Taratulah (Taratulu). This purely Kurdish district is peaceful when the Jaf are not passing through ; soldiers were posted at Bali Kadar and Mishian. Sival, Alan, and Mahut (Mahud) (mudirliks .—These districts, running from east to west, are well wooded and mountainous, inhabited by sedentary Kurds, who seem well satisfied with their Turkish rulers. Turkish posts existed— In Sival, at Shivekail, twenty or thirty men. In Alan, none seen. In Mahut, at Mahut, twenty reported. Pishdr. —The headquarters of this district is Mamurat-al-Hamid (Mamoure) formerly known as Kala Diza, where there is a telegraph office. There is a mudir here and thirty or forty zaptiehs, with posts at Kandol and (when we arrived) at Wazneh, which was subsequently evacuated. Baluk (Baliki). —This is a frontier sub-district of Rawanduz, with the headquarters at Rayat, where there is a telegraph office. There is a kaimakam at Rawanduz with a few gendarmes, and a few zaptiehs are stationed at Rayat. Shamsdinan (Hakkiari). —The most northerly district under the Mosul vilayet is the Shamsdinan district, with headquarters at Neri, which is also the headquarters of the Hakkiari sanjaq. There is a telegraph office here, and a kaimakam and some zaptiehs. This is also the last frontier district draining towards the Persian Gulf. We now enter the Erzeroum vdayet, which is fully reported on in Colonel Maunselhs “ Military Report on Eastern Turkey in Asia, Vol. Ill,” to which there islittle of permanent importance to add. frontier are (from south to north): The headquarters of Turkish officials along this 1. Diza (Gavvar plain). £&gt; as h_hala (Albak district), with a permanent post at Dair. 3. Serai (Malmudie plain). 4. Bayazid. There are telegraph offices at all of them; (1) and (2) being connected, and (2)» (3), and (4) each being separately connected with Van. It will be apparent from the foregoing that the organisation of frontier guards on the Turkish side is systematic, and that when necessary it can be rapidly expanded, a ^, in .^ e °f 1914. It may be added that the Turks seem to have a fairly enective hold over the Kurds, who generally speak with respect of their “ effendis.” Order appears to be fairly well maintained, a great improvement being noticeable in this respect as compared with the state of things described by Mr. Soane in 1910. II .—Erection qf Boundary Pillars. Of the 223 pillars established by the Commission 10 were natural objects, rocks, shrines, &amp;c., 18 were large mounds of earth (all in Arabistan), 79 were piles of stones without cement or mortar, and 116 were piles of stones set in cement or mortar. The distribution of the various kinds of pillar along different sections of the frontier is approximately shown by the following table :— — Earth. Stones without Cement. Stones or Bricks with Cement. Arabistan .. 18 0 5 Pusht-i-Kuh .. .. .. 2 20 Latitude 34-35 (transferred territories) # # 3 19 ,, 35—36 9 26 „ 36-end 65 46 • 18 79 116 Total.. .. 213 Representations w'ere made by the Turkish Government in June to the effect that the frontier pillars were not of sufficiently strong construction, and all the commissioners received orders from their respective Governments to see that better ones were erected in future. As will be seen from fhe above table, however, the proportion of. pillars erected with cement grew steadily smaller, the majority north of latitude 36 (where Russian interests officially commenced) being mere piles of stones carelessly erected. This is sufficient commentary on the Russian Ambassador’s suggestion, in July, that the faulty erection of pillars south of latitude 36° was due to the Commission moving too rapidly, for north of latitude 36° the number of miles marched per day decreased, and the number of days spent halting for no particular reason per month increased steadily. The earthen pillars are probably the most satisfactory of all, being difficult to destroy without much labour. As to the remainder, the Commission was not encouraged to spend much money or time on the erection of frontier pillars by the fact that Arabs and Lurs took a pleasure in destroying them almost as soon as erected, and even boasted in advance of their intention of doing so as soon as the Commission left. As a matter of fact, scarcity of grazing and lack of water would have made work impossible had the Commission been even a fortnight longer in reaching Mendeli. Everywhere along the frontier pillars were pulled down a few days after the Commission had left; the more solidly constructed they were the greater the energy displayed in their demolition. It is very doubtful whether one pillar in twenty is still standing. Under such conditions it would have been a waste of money to erect expensive pillars, particularly as this would have involved great delay and consequent heavy expense, running into thousands of pounds, to the mediating Governments. The actual sum spent on the erection of pillars is a trifle over 300L12 LIST OF APPENDICES. I. Report by Lieutenant-Colonel Ryder on the work accomplished by the different survey parties.

I HAVE the honour to submit some note$ on the survey work carried out by the detachment of the survey of India under my orders. . . , , T Owing; to the short time at my disposal and the work stdl remaining to be done, 1 am unable to send in a full report &gt; this will be submitted to the Government of India on nw return to India. . . n ^ i 2. I, however, take this opportunity of bringing to your notice the excellent work done by the following :— Major H M. Cowie, R.E., carried out the triangulation single-handed, except for some assistance in the south. This necessitated his working almost continuously either at outdoor observations or at computations. He regularly had points ready tor the surveyors to base their work on, a feat which necessitated very arduous work, under trying conditions. He is an officer of high scientific attainments, coupled with^ good physical energy. I would very strongly bring his wbrk to your notice, and trust it will receive due recognition from Government. . . . au . . , . Mr. Abdul Rahim, K.B., accompanied the Commission as lar as Gasr-i-bhiring his experience and tact were very useful in assisting Major Cowie with the triangulation. 3. I cannot too highly recommend the work of the surveyors. Khan Bahadur Sher Ja.ng is a surveyor of great experience, who has been constantly on similar expeditions and invariably given the utmost satisfaction. His work has throughout been most accurate and rapid, and has inspired the fullest confidence amongst the members of the Turkish and Persian Commissions, with whom he has a great faculty for making friends, as well as^with the local chiefs, who conversed confidentially to him after a very short acquaintance. I trust his work will receive due recognition from Government. . Surveyor Hamid Gul is a very fast and accurate surveyor, in whom I have, as I have in Khan Bahadur Sher Jang, the greatest confidence ; very hard working ; his work has invariably been accepted by the Commission and has always proved correct. I trust his work will receive due recognition from Government. Surveyor Sujawal Khan, a hardworking, painstaking surveyor who has given me satisfaction. I propose to mention his name for departmental reward. I llLclVO (&amp;0 C. H. D. BYDEB., Lieutenant-Colonel, R.E. Confidential Notes on Survey Work, Turco-Persian Frontier Commission. 1.

Surveyor Sujawal Khan. Forty-two Khalasis.The party assembled at Mohammerah on the 18th December, 1913. One Khalasi died at Mohammerah and two were invalided in March 1914. Twelve accompanied Mr. Abdul Rahim when he returned to India from Qasr-i-Shirin in May 1914. Major Cowie, Surveyor Sujawal Khan, and seventeen Khalasis returned to India from Kotour in September 1914. Lieutenant-Colonel Ryder, Mr. Sher Jang, and Surveyor Hamid Gul and ten Khalasis returned to India in October 1914 at the close of the Commission. Lieutenant-Colonel Ryder was appointed deputy-commissioner from the 16th July, 1914, m addition to his duties as in charge of the survey party. 2. Triangulation. En route to Mohammerah Major Cowie stopped at Bushire, while Lieutenant- Colonel Ryder went to Fao, the landing point of the cable at the mouth of the Shatt- el-Arab, and observations were taken for time at both places, with an interchange of telegraphic signals to determine the difference of longitude between these two places, the longitude of Bushire having already been accurately fixed during the Indo-European longitude observations in 1895. Fao had aldready been connected with Mohammerah, 35 miles up the river, by naval triangulation, and further observations and exchange of signals between Major Cowie at Nasiri and Lieutenant-Colonel Ryder at Mohammerah gave a very fair initial longitude for Nasiri,^ from which triangulation started. This work was placed in Major Cowie’s hands, assisted as far as Qasr-i-Shirin by Mr. Abdul Rahim. As it would have been impossible for any system of rigorous triangulation to keep pace with the work of the Commission the system adopted by Major Cowie was as follows :— At Nasiri astronomical observations were taken for latitude and azimuth, and a base was measured with an Invar tape. With these data Major Cowie carried on a regular series of triangles as far as Oumm Chir, where he was caught up by the Commission. From there to the Tyb River trigonometrical connection was maintained, partly by regular series of triangles, partly by a short length of theodolite traverse. From the Tyb River onwards the regular series of triangles was discontinued, and other methods employed to preserve connection. From the advanced stations of the regular series two or more points in the direction in which we were moving wtere fixed by observations. When the Commission had marched to a suitable place in advance of these fixed points a base was measured, and the latitude and azimuth observed astronomically, and a small network of triangulation carried out. From stations of the network observations were made to the points fixed in rear permitting of the determination of the longitude of the network. At the same time further advanced points were fixed and used as described above when the Commission had in due course marched beyond them. The method may be summarised briefly as the measurement of a base, the determination, astronomically, of the latitude and azimuth, the observation of already fixed points to bring up the longitude, and the fixing of advanced points to carry the longitude forward. The process was repeated as often as was necessary, i.e , at Dewairij, Baksai, Mendeli, Qasr-i-Chirine, Halabdja, Pendjvine, Vezneh, Bassova, and Ouroumia. Points were thus given to the topographers on which to base their work, or when they were sent too far in advance for this to be possible to adjust their work on to afterwards. All observations were made with a 6-inch micrometer theodolite. A little south of latitude 36° the Russian Commission was reinforced by Lieutenant-Colonel Krimlikof, who had arrived with orders, apparently from his departmental chief at Tiflis, to measure a base somewhere in Sardasht, and to carry on a regular first class triangulation from there northwards to the Russian frontier. It being obvious, even to the Russians, that this scheme was impracticable, if his work was to be of any use to the Commission, it was agreed that Lieutenant-Colonel Krimlikof should do the astronomical work while Major Cowie did the triangulation itself. The arrangement, however, fell through, as when Major Cowie arrived at Vezneh he found that Colonel Krimlikof had received orders from Tiflis to carry out his regular programme. The latter left the Commission with Captain Alief and measured a base in Lahidjan, with a Yaderin apparatus, an operation which occupied six officers about ten days. He then was to have himself carried on his triangulation up to Ouroumia while Captain Alief was to work from thence to the Russian frontier. [2286 2—4] _E14 We met the latter at Ouroumia and explained to him the position and description of Major Cowie’s station at Sair, near Ouroumia, so that their work could be connected Wlth In the meantime, from latitude 36° as the Russians had taken over the bulk of the topoOTciphical work, which they connected with their previous work m Azerbaijan base? on graphically-fixed points, Major Cowie only continued his tnangulation m order R connect it on with similar Russian work, at or near Ararat. _ i j i u- M. Minorsky strongly opposed this, though his opposition was not shared by ms technical staff. Major Cowie, however, continued on as far as Kotour, from whence he was unfortunately unable to see Mount Ararat owing to cloudy weather. As he had for some time been suffering in health from his hard work, and as we imagined that we had at any rate secured a connection with the Russian triangulation at Sair, and orders had been' received for his return to India as soon as possible, he left the Commission Since then we have heard casually from M. Minorsky that Colonel Krimlikof had abandoned his triangulation, leaving ours therefore without any connection m the North. , . ., The intervention of the Russian triangulators is therefore a regrettable incident, which has resulted in their doing nothing and preventing us from completing our work, after having carried it successfully over so long a distance. The tnangulation will be published in two sheets, one of which has been com pleted, and the other will be finished off in India. These sheets will be published, and full details can then be given of the area covered. 3. Topography. It had been laid down in the Protocol of the 7th/Uth November, 1913, that the Identic map was to serve as a base for the topographical work. I refer to this map elsewhere ; it soon proved its worthlessness. It was, however, decided to adopt the scale of this map as the official scale of the Commission maps, i.e., 1 inch = 1 geogra phical mile 1/73.050, and this scale was retained in use, with one exception, for all maps up to latitude 36°, when the Russian scale of 1 inch = 'Z versts 1/84,000 was adopted, as they had already printed maps on this scale, trom latitude 36 30 north wards of the Persian side of the frontier. The exception above mentioned was for “ Carte supplementaire No. 7, where the scale of 1 inch = 4 English miles had to be adopted owing principally to lack of vater. The Identic map was accepted for— (1.) The Shatt-al-Arab. 1^2.) The desert up to Oumm Chir. (3.) Between the Tyb River and near Baksai. (4.) Sirwan River. (5.) Avroman Mountains. (6.) Kialou (lesser Zab) River. It will be noticed that these comprise in most part in each case a single topo graphical feature which itself formed the frontier, and of which an accurate map was not necessary. The system adopted for carrying out the work did not vary greatly. One or two surveyors, supplied with topographical points by Major Cowie, were sent on ahead, and had their map ready by the time the Commission arrived ; in no case was it necessary to await the completion of maps by our surveyors. From latitude 36°, where the Russians took over the main topographical map by completing their 2-verst maps on the Turkish side, our surveyors were employed on larger scale surveys (1/50,000) of those areas which were under dispute, that is, of those places where the frontier left the watershed. The country traversed was throughout, except north of Mendeli, of any easy nature for surveying, especially in the absolutely treeless region in the north ; the difficulties which we had to contend with were— 1. The want of water in the south and the great heat which resulted in haze and an abnormal amount of refraction. 2. The tension in the north owing to the war and the general lawlessness amongst the tribes, Arabs, Persian, and Kurdish along the whole frontier.3. The rapidity with which the Commission worked necessitated very rapid work on the part of the surveyors, which again encouraged the Commission to work fast. ^ The total area surveyed by the British Commission on the different scale is shown mn the following table, the difference between the two columns being due to the energy of ojir surveyors who, in the south, never confined themselves to the bare area necessary for the work of the Commission, but surveyed as large an area as possible in the time at their disposal. Scale. Area Surveyed. Area Mapped for the Commission. 1/50,000 430 14 3,612 417 1/63,360 1/73,050 3,250 1/84,000 .. 700 1/253,440 .. 3,470 Total .. 7,526 4,367 The total length of the frontier from Fao to Ararat is 1,180 miles of which 1,140 were demarcated and 40 left undemarcated at Kotour. 4. Fair Drawing. In addition to the field work, fair maps had to be drawn showing the frontier, which were approved and signed by the commissioners. Each nation made two copies, this entailed a great deal of extra work for our surveyors, who not only had to make our two copies of each map, but also assisted the other nations, Turks especially, in making theirs. Sheets 1-8 were sent for publication to Calcutta,and copies received before the close of the Commission. Sheets 9-15 were sent to England, but owing to the war their publication was delayed. Sheets 16—25 will be taken to India for publication. These were entitled “ Cartes supplementaires,” In addition to these, “ Cartes detailleesT to the number of ten, were surveyed and drawn on larger scales, mostly 1/50,000. The frontier line was also drawn in as accurately as possible taking into account the inaccuracy of the map, on the ten photographic copies of the Identic map, three copies for ourselves, three for Russians, and two each for the Persians and Turks. The rapid and excellent printing of the maps at the Survey Office in Calcutta, made a great impression on the other Commissions, who unanimously confided to the British Commission the task of printing the remainder. 5. Com'position of Worh done by, and Delations with, Technical Staffs of other Commissions. It is most interesting, on an International Commission, to study the work done by other nations and their methods. On this occasion this study was illuminating if not instructive. Persians. —Staff: Abdul Rezaqh Khan, Sartip, a kindly old gentleman of scientific tastes, who was accompanied by two topographers, Mohsin Khan, and Ali Asghar Khan. They arrived at Mohammerah without any instruments ; these had been ordered by them from Europe, and arrived towards the close of the Commission. We lent them a plane table as did the Russians and with these with much effort they produced three small maps only two of which were made use of (12 a and 16 c), the latter worse than useless. _ After a prolonged absence of three weeks on the Kandil range, they reappeared with a map of which the bulk was of no use whatever. They then subsided into the more congenial role of copying maps. Turhs. —Staff: Captain Mehmet Effendi (replaced later by Captain Salih Itffendi) and Lieutenant Kadri Effendi. Of these the former made one small effort at surveying, which never saw the light of day, near Mendeli; Salih Effendi never did any surveying, but Kadri Effendi made several efforts, and would with proper training be quite useful.They contributed 16 a, 16 b, and a small portion of 8. They got very behindhand with their copying of maps, and had to be largely assisted by the British survey stall. It was extremely conducive to the progress of the Commission that neither the Persian nor the Turkish survey staffs made more efforts to do outdoor work, but were content to play a secondary role. They both accepted without hesitation all the work done by our surveyors, but were more reluctant in accepting that of the Russians, after^ studying their maps and observing their somewhat dilettante methods. Russians .— Captain Tshahakaya and Captain Alief comprised the staff from Mohammerah,. They had necessary instruments for plane-tabling, but no Cossacks, whom they use mounted as we do Khalasis on foot; it was probably for this reason that they did not carrv out the two pieces of work near Mohammerah, which I suggested for them, when the Russian commissioner expressed a wish for his technical staff to co-operate with us “ on terms of absolute equality.” Later on they surveyed maps 5, 8, 12, and 15, all small sheets. ffe Near Pendjvine Colonel Andriewsky, of the General Staff, joined us as chief of the military and topographical staff, he was not however a surveyor ; a little later on Colonel Krimlikof joined, but left with Captain Alief at Vezneh. From the neighbourhood of latitude 36° Captains Yordanof, Yemilianof, and Chernof all joined as topographers. They had to survey both sides of the frontier as far as 36° 3O', after which they had printed copies of their 1-inch = 2-verst map of the Persian side, which lessened their work considerably, although it was often found inaccurate in the neighbourhood of the frontier. Captain Tshahakaya proved by far the neatest and most accurate of the Russians, the last three who joined being very casual in their methods. Their methods of surveying is slow, but accurate, of ground near the surveyor ; they made little use of the system of sketching in ground at some distance, so well used in the Survey of India. It is no exaggeration to say our surveyors worked twice as fast with much greater accuracy. From latitude 36°, where the topographical work was handed over to them, they contributed maps 17-25. 6. The approximate areas surveyed by the different commissioners, and made use of for the frontier delimitation are as follows : — British (out of 7,526 square miles actually surveyed) Persian Turkish Russian (together with 2,000 square miles previously surveyed) Square miles. 4,367 75 42 1,300 Our relations with the technical staff of all three nations were most cordial throughout They constantly expressed their admiration for the work of our Indian surveyors, and the objection which was raised to the strength of our staff was only raised by M. Minorsky, and I was assured by the Russian officers was not agreed to by them. Although French was the official language of the Commission only one Russian survey officer was able to converse in that language. 7- While at Mohammerah M. Minorsky was much perturbed at the strength of our survey party compared to his, the necessities of the work being apparently to him a secondary consideration compared to the question as to which nation should have the larger camp. As, however, there was a previous agreement arrived at at Constantinople that we should do the greater part of the surveying in the south, while the Russians did it in the north, Mr. Wratislaw came to an agreement with M. Minorsky that our Indian surveyors should return to India from Qasr-i-Shirin, where the Russian survey pnrty would be correspondingly increased. On our arrival there, there were no signs of any more Russian surveyors, and M. Minorsky was obliged very reluctantly to ask that our surveyors should continue to carry on the work as far as latitude 36°, when the question would be discussed afresh. We had already arranged to send Mr. Abdul Rahim back, so the three surveyors continued with us, it being obvious to everyone, including even M. Minorsky, that his two officers would be quite incapable of doing the necessary work. On our arrival on the Lesser Zab, latitude 36°, our men ceased to work, and M. Minorsky demanded that they should then be sent back to India. In the meanwhile the whole Commission was delayed purposely by M. Minorsky, to give his two officers time to work ahead and for him to receive too long delayed additional staff, one of whom joined us at Vezneh; the fourth topographer did not join till considerably later. 8; Although Mr. Wratislaw explained fully to M. Minorsky his reasons for objecting to sending the surveyors back then, namely (1), that we had, at M. Minorsky’sown request, brought them on from Qasr-i-Shirin, from whence they could have returned easily, to the Lesser Zab, where their return was a most difficult thing to arrange for; (2) that the arrangement at Qasr-i-Shirin cancelled that at Mohammerah; and (3) that we had yet to see the reinforcement of the Russian staff, M. Minorsky Reiterated bis objection. Owing to Mr. Wratislaw’s departure from Vezneh causing a vacancy in the survey staff, Lieutenant-Colonel Ryder being appointed deputy commissioner, Captain Wilson made an agreement with M. Minorsky that Mr. Sher Jang should fill the vacancy, Hamid Gul should become draftsman to the Commission, and Sujawal Khan should return to India at the first opportunity, we, on the other hand, agreeing not to survey in Azerbaijan or the “ approaches to Tehran,” except at the request of the Commission. Owing to the outbreak of the war no opportunity did occur to send Sujawal Khan back, until he left Kotour with the escort on the 21st September. In the meantime, and up to the close of the Commission, our surveyors, at M. Minorsky’s special request, surveyed on the scale 1/50,000 the five places where the frontier left the watershed, the only disputed portions. 9. As it turned out, it was most fortunate that our surveyors did continue with the Commission, as their work was accepted without demur by the Turks, which would certainly not have been the case had this work been left to the Russians. At Kotour, for instance, the Russian map proving unreliable, and on too small a scale to enable the frontier to be even discussed, Aziz Bey, the Turkish commissioner made a point of asking that our surveyors should execute a complete survey of the area. 10. The following existing maps were made use of by the Commission :— (1.) Maunsell’s map of Turkey in Asia (seven sheets), I.D.W.O. 1522. This proved invaluable as a guide for marches, &amp;c., and most useful, on account of its accuracy, for frontier purposes. (2.) The reduced identic map, scale 1 inch = 4 English miles (in nine sheets), misleading as regards the frontier in a few places ; it was useful as a general map. (3.) The identic map, in fourteen large sheets, scale 1 /73,050 or 1 inch = 1 geogra phical mile, this scale having been adopted apparently because the English surveyor on the previous commission was a naval man. We had ten photographed copies and one of four originals, a beautiful work of art, which took years to compile and draw, and which proved dreadfully inaccurate and misleading. It is probable that the work of the present Commission would not have suffered much if this map had not been in existence. The previous Commission lasted from 1849-53, and this map was not published till 1869. The following extract from the diary (translated) of M. Tchirikof, the Russian commissioner, shows how the surveys were carried out from which this map was compiled :— “ The mediating commissioners at first intended to measure a base in the desert near Mohammerah, to define it by means of astronomical observations, and to carry on their work thence in a northerly direction. They had begun their labours, when they were interrupted by the disputes, already referred to, between the Mussulman commis sioners. The scientific work had to be made dependent on the progress of the political questions. As, after the difficulties at Mohammerah, the Commissions recommenced their negotiations at Zohab and Mendeli, it was necessary to start the geodetic work from the latter place as a centre, and to continue it both in a northerly and southerly direction, according to local circumstances The work was therefore proceeded with in the following manner :— “ 1. From Mendeli a geodetic triangulation was carried out to Ararat, the position of which was first defined by the astronomer Feodorovitch, and afterwards more accurately by the triangulation of Transacaucasia carried out under General Chodsko. The bases of this triangulation were defined astronomically, i.e., the latitudes and azimuths of the points between them taken and their relative positions thus defined. From these points subsidiary triangulations, &amp;c., were afterwards taken. The astronomical bases had a length of from 30 to 40 geographical miles. The latitudes were determined by the stars, chiefly by the Pole star, and by one of the Southern stars of the same altitude. For this purpose use was made of a sextant, placed cn a stand, and sometimes of a circle ; both were divided into divisions of ten seconds. The [2286 z—4] FCommissions being harassed by Aiabs, tilt survey woik nau SU rveved fron^ help of p a rticular^signals Th a e di g t r ance was calculated by a horse’s sten ^3'Smile's to the hour). At the turns of these lines, at places where the surveyors step (33 miles to tne ; determined. If the lines, marked with signals, after hSet^d ty\“ to be either too long or too short in relation to the latitudes determined between their extremities, the lines were corrected accordance) 1 witlf th^' relative length. By this means the longrtnde of the pomts of stoppage was defined with satisfactory accuracy. “Both these methods, triangulation and measuring by means of signals had been employed b! the astronomer Glascott in the delimitation of Venezuela, Brazd and Ttritish Guiana in 1841-43 ; the former method in open country, the latter, i.e., y means of signais, along dvem where the forests on the banks hid the neighbouring country. In this case, the calculation of distances was made by the movement of the b ° at “ Altogether fifty-four points were astronomically determined on the Turco-Persian Fr0n “ The geometrical triangulation was carried out without any interruption from one end of the frontier to the other by means of the compass, and connected with the astronomical points. The surveys themselves were carried out on the scale of 1 verst to the English inch, which is generally employed in our military topograp ica survt ys. or ^ arat;on of t ] ie map the Commission agreed to adopt one scale, that of the geographical mile to the English inch; for this purpose it was necessary to reduce the original surveys.” Appendix II .—Details of Personnel of the British Commission.

It was from the first clear that the British Commission would have to rely mainly on mules for transport purposes; it had been intended to hire a few camels, to carry fodder, Berthon boats, &amp;c., but the time of the year was unfavourable and rates in ?^.rabistan were prohibitive. ^ Fifty camels were obtained locally near Amara by a contractor, at his own risk, to accompany the commission, carrying foodstuffs, the contractor’s property, for issue as required by the various commissions. They proved unsatisfactory, carrying little more than mules, unable to march for more than a few days at a time, and becoming useless from sore backs very quickly. The Commission left Mohammerah with— 152 Dizfuli mules, 51 Arab mules, 24 Shushtari mules, and 9 Hamadani mules. * The fifty-one Arab mules were dismissed near Baksai and the Hamadanis at Qasr. Another batch of forty-two mules was obtained at Qasr-i-Shirin, to carry on to Urumieh reserve supplies, additional tents, &amp;c., which had accumulated there. This batch was sent on ahead from Panjwin to Urumieh, with spare loads, and dismissed there, leaving the Commission with 176 mules, plus 14 mules which had been purchased en route, total 190. A part of the Dizfuli mules were dismissed at Urumieh, leaving the Commission with 164 mules. The mules worked satisfactorily throughout, grazing was available for them all the way from the Dawairij to Urumieh ; had it not been so, the commission could scarcely have performed its task, the country passed through being scantily populated and unable to supply straw and barley for so large a number of animals. The mules were hired at 4 krans a day, subsequently increased (at Panjwin) to 41 krans, and finally raised (after Urumieh) to 5 krans. The head muleteer was paid 100 krans a month and was primarily responsible for passing on all orders given and for seeing that loads were properly distributed amongst different owners. . . The number of mules required by the British Commission was large—perhaps unduly so; the approximate distribution was as follows :— Commissioner Deputy Commissioner Each officer, 4 Office and head clerk Mirza .. .. Escort .. .. • • Hospital (including* sub-assistant surgeon) Mess and mess servants Cash and presentation articles Government servants, farrashes, &amp;c. Survey party Including Tentage and Servants. 10 10 20 6 3 40 6 25 4 10 30 164 Plus surplus stores, reserve rations, winter clothes, &amp;c., 30 to 50 mules. The number required by the escort was throughout larger than it should have been, the sowars having brought with them an excessive amount of tentage, personal kit, and impedimenta. . , . The average load carried by each mule was 200 lb. ; many mules carried 240 to 280 lb. without difficulty, if the loads were compact.For the general use of the Commission tents were purchased from the Elgin Mills Company, Cawnpore, India, and also obtained on indent from the Arsenal. Other camp equipment was obtained from the Supply and Transport Corps in India; all articles obtained were satisfactory. The Russian Commission and, to some extent, the Persian Commission, were also stuaplied with camp equipment from the Elgin Mills Company, the Ordnance Depart- mJut, and Supply and Transport Corps; the articles supplied gave complete satisfaction. Lists showing the principal articles of equipment purchased are attached. All Government tentage and equipment and surplus stationery, &amp;c., were sold locally at the conclusion of the Commission and the proceeds credited to Government. Good prices were realised, particularly for tents. The amount expended on tentage, &amp;c., would have been smaller had it been possible to predict with certainty : (1) That the hills would be reached before the hot weather began ; (2) That the work would be finished before winter began. Until the last moment both these contingencies seemed not unlikely and had to be provided against.

It was arranged from the beginning, at Captain Wilson’s suggestion, that the accounts of the Commission (with the exception of the salary of Mr. Wratislaw) should be submitted monthly to the Government of India (he., to the Comptroller, India Treasuries) in the usual way, and that the Commission should finance itself by drawing Supply Bills upon the Government of India. This arrangement worked very satisfactorily, though the absence of reliable and regular postal communication on the frontier, and the ever increasing distance from India, made a good deal of delay in the submission of accounts inevitable. Accounts were kept throughout on the double entry system, a balance sheet being prepared monthly and circulated to all officers. There was a central treasure chest under the charge of an officer, who issued money therefrom against the written order of officers, on special cheque forms provided for the purpose. Each officer, each unit in the camp for accounts purposes (ie., survey, escort, mess, each foreign Commission, each muleteer, contractor, &amp;c.) had a separate account in the ledger, as also did each commercial firm or branch of a bank with which the Commission was in financial relations, the total number of ledger accounts averaging about fifty. All this involved no little labour, but it is to be doubted whether any other system would have worked smoothly, having regard to the fact that owing to defective postal arrangements and the constant absence of officers accounts often remained unsettled for months. As it was, the knowledge that the account system was sound relieved the British Commissioner from much anxiety, and enabled him, without undue labour or responsi bility, to oblige his colleagues with occasional loans, to make purchases on their behalf, and to undertake various minor responsibilities, such as the purchase of tentage and furniture for the foreign Commissions, which were greatly appreciated. All this would have been difficult unless the accounts system was sound and elastic, especially when it is remembered that five coinages have been in regular use (Sterling, Indian, Russian, Turkish, and Persian). Accounts were kept in rupees throughout, conversions being made approximately at the rate current at the nearest branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia.i J o 30 The Government of India sanctioned two additional clerks to deal with the accounts of the Mission, but orders on the subject were received too late for it to be possible to take action thereon, and Mr. Abdul Alim has had the sole charge of the accounts m addition to heavy routine clerical work. The successful working of the system, under by no means easy conditions, and single-handed, reflects most creditably upon Mr. Abdul Alim.4 Dana le cas oil le trace definitif de latrontifere laisserait en dehors du temtoue otto- mat, une section de la route qui passe pres de Kyzyl-kaya et qm relie le distnct de Bayard 1 l a province de Van, 11 est entendu que le Gourernement person accordera hbre passage par cette section de la route a la Poste Imperiale ottomane, aux voyageurs et aux marchandises, exception faite des troupes et des convois militaires.
